IDENTIFICATION, GENERAL INFORMATION, AND CERTIFICATION This Section must be completed for all projects. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT RECEIVED Narrative Description Provide in the space below, a brief narrative description of the project. Explain WHAT is to be done, NOT WHY it is being done. If the project site does NOT have a street address, include a legal description of the site. Include the rationale regarding the project's classification as substantive or non-substantive. Include: the number and type of beds involved; the actions proposed (establishment, expansion and/or modernization); the ESTIMATED total project cost and the funding source(s) for the project. The Applicants to the project are The Alden Group, Ltd. (Parent), Alden New Lenox, LLC (owner) and Alden Estates-Courts of New Lenox, Inc. (operator) and co-Applicant, New Lenox Investments I, LLC. The Applicants are proposing the establishment of Alden Estates of New Lenox (Estates) and Alden Courts of New Lenox (Courts), collectively a single 166-bed nursing facility. Alden Estates of New Lenox will house the 114 general long-term nursing beds (80,100 GSF) and it will be connected to Alden Courts of New Lenox a 52-bed Skilled memory care facility (29,300 GSF) treating residents suffering with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) for a total of 109,400 gross square feet. The Board had previously approved Project No. 15-051 authorizing Alden to establish a 140-bed facility on this site. Alden now proposes that the project instead be a I66-bed facility. Because the change is larger than permissible through a permit alteration, Alden has filed this application for a new permit and, as a condition to approval, would withdraw the permit approved for Project No. 15-051. The Estates will be a three-story brick and masonry structure with a \"main street commons\" on the first floor and residents' rooms on the second and third floors. The first floor will offer ancillary services and common area amenities for residents, to include an old fashion ice cream parlor, a beauty salon and barber shop, a non-denominational chapel, private dining room for residents and their guests and a club room. An out-patient therapy is also being contemplated to meet the needs of discharged Estates' residents who are still in need of additional therapy. In addition to the general long-term care services to be provided, the Estates will provide sub-acute services to include pulmonary and ventilator care as well as orthopedic rehabilitation services. The Courts will be a separate, distinct, and IDPH Licensure disclosed memory care facility in a single- story structure. The physical layout will be provided with separate wings that will specialize in the different stages of dementia. It should be noted that both the Estates and the Courts will offer separate and distinct common areas. However, the Applicant will have efficiencies built in through the shared use of a single kitchen and laundry facility. Furthermore, the proposed nursing beds are two components located on a 6.64 acres site adjacent to Silver Cross Hospital.

PROPERTY Seller owns and desires to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, approximately 6.64 acres of real property located on proposed Cedar Crossings Drive in New Lenox, Will County, Illinois, more or less as identified as part of the Cedar Crossings commercial development (the \"Development\") outlined on the site plan attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\" and made a part hereof, together with any improvements now located on or in such real property and all rights, privileges, and easements appurtenant to such real property (collectively, the \"Property\") for the sum of ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY-FIVE THOUSAND AND 92/100 DOLLARS ($1,755,092) (the \"Purchase Price\"). During the Inspection Period (as defined below), Buyer and Seller will act in good faith to agree on the boundaries of the Property. Upon reaching agreement on the boundaries the parties shall execute an amendment to this Agreement setting forth the final configuration and legal description of the Property. Buyer will obtain, at Buyer's cost, a current ALTA survey of the Property in its final configuration (\"Survey\") prepared by a registered land surveyor, and the Purchase Price will be adjusted at Closing (defined below) based on the actual square footage of the Property, as determined in the Survey, at $5.95 per net square foot or fraction thereof For purposes of this Agreement, Buyer's proposed development on the Property shall be a skilled nursing and memory care facility (the \"Project\"). 2. PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE The Purchase Price shall be payable as follows: (a) Within five (5) business days after the Effective Date, Buyer will deliver into an escrow account with Title Services, Inc., 610 E. Roosevelt Road, Suite 100, Wheaton, IL 60187 (630-690-9130) (\"Escrow Agent\" or \"Title THOUSAND AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($25,000) (the \"First Deposit\") which shall entitle Buyer, for a period of six (6) months after the Effective Date (the \"Inspection Period\"), to inspect, evaluate and make tests of the Property, review title to the Property, survey the Property, make inquiries of applicable governmental authorities, determine the acceptability of the soil conditions and environmental condition of the Property, and (with Seller's cooperation as needed, at Buyer's expense) obtain all third party approvals and consents, all as Buyer may deem appropriate (collectively, \"Buyer's Inspections\"), in order that Buyer may determine whether, in Buyer's sole discretion, the Property is suitable for the development of the Project and the contingencies set forth in Section 7 can be satisfied. If Buyer shall determine during the Inspection Period not to proceed to Closing under this Agreement, then Buyer shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement, for any reason or no reason, in which event the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer, and thereafter Buyer shall have no further obligation or liability hereunder. ATTACHMENT-2B 46 For purposes of this Agreement, the \"Effective Date\" shall be that day upon which this Agreement has been both (a) fully executed by Buyer and Seller, and (b delivered to Buyer. (b) Prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, by sending written notice to Seller, Buyer shall be entitled to extend the Inspection Period for an additional seven (7) months (the \"Initial Due Diligence Period\"). Upon Buyer's election to extend the Inspection Period for the Initial Due Diligence Period, the First Deposit shall be rendered nonrefundable except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, provided that the First Deposit shall be applicable to the Purchase Price at Closing. Provided, however, if Buyer has not received final zoning approval for the Project prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period and Buyer shall not receive such final zoning approval during the first 60 days of the Initial Due Diligence Period, and Buyer shall terminate the Agreement on or before such 60 day period, the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer, and thereafter Buyer shall have no further obligation or liability hereunder. Buyer shall be responsible for the completion of any required zoning provided that Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer, at no material cost to Seller, in Buyer's request for zoning entitlements. (c) Prior to the expiration of the Initial Due Diligence Period, by sending written notice to Seller, Buyer shall be entitled to extend the Initial Due Diligence Period for an additional seven (7) months (the \"Extended Due Diligence Period\", together with the Initial Due Diligence Period, the \"Due Diligence Period\") by depositing with Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of the Initial Due Diligence Period an additional TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($25,000) (the \"Second Deposit\", together with the First Deposit, the \"Deposits\"). Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Second Deposit shall be nonrefundable except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, provided that the Second Deposit shall be applicable to the Purchase Price at Closing. (d) In the event that Buyer shall have determined that the Buyer's Contingencies (defined below) are satisfied or otherwise waived and given Seller the Purchase Notice, the Deposits shall be applied to the Purchase Price. lf, after exercising its option to utilize the Due Diligence Period, Buyer does not terminate this Agreement prior to the end of the Due Diligence Period and does not provide a Purchase Notice (defined below) to Seller, Buyer shall be deemed to waive Buyer's Contingencies and the Deposits shall be nonrefundable except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, provided the Deposits shall be applied to the Purchase Price at Closing and the Closing shall occur on the 30th day after the end of the Due Diligence Period. (e) Seller and Buyer shall execute Escrow Agent's standard form joint order escrow agreement. Escrow Agent shall promptly deposit the Deposits in a segregated, federally-insured, interest-bearing account, subject to immediate withdrawal.

All interest earned on the Deposits shall accrue for the benefit of Buyer. 3, CLOSING; LIKE-KIND EXCHANGE The closing of the purchase of the Property (the \"Closing\") shall occur in escrow on or before thirty (30) days after Buyer delivers the Purchase Notice, but in no event shall the -2- ATTACHMENT-2B 47 Purchase Notice be delivered later than the last day of the Due Diligence Period. Buyer shall specify in the Purchase Notice the date of Closing (the \"Closing Date\"). Each party agrees to cooperate with the other, at the other's election, in effecting a tax- deferred, like-kind exchange with respect to the Property, pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The party electing an exchange of the Property shall provide the other with written notice thereof at least two (2) business days prior to Closing. Either party's election to exchange the Property shall be at no cost or liability to the other. In no event shall this Section obligate a party not effectuating an exchange to take title to any real property (other than the Property in Buyer's case). 4. DEED AND TITLE Seller shall not lease, contract to sell, sell or encumber the Property while this Agreement remains in effect. At Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a Special Warranty Deed conveying to Buyer or Buyer's nominee fee simple title to the Property, free and clear of all encumbrances except Permitted Exceptions, as defined below. Seller, for itself and its successors and assigns agrees that, so long as Buyer is operating a skilled nursing and memory care facility on the Property, then Seller agrees that the Remainder Parcel (defined below) shall be restricted against use for the purpose of a skilled nursing and memory care facility. Seller agrees to record a declaration at Closing, in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, against the Remainder Parcel confirming such use restriction. The \"Remainder Parcel\" is defined as the land which comprises the Development (but not including the Property) and is owned by Seller as of the Effective Date. Within fifteen (15) days after the Effective Date, Buyer shall order an ALTA extended coverage owner's commitment for title insurance for the Property (or, if necessary, the greater parcel of which the Property is a part) (the \"Preliminary Title Report\"), issued by the Title Services Inc. (the \"Title Company\"), including legible copies of all exceptions to title set forth in the Preliminary Title Report. Buyer shall have until the expiration of the Inspection Period to approve of or object to any matters referenced in the Preliminary Title Report and the Survey and any amendments or updates thereto. If Buyer's examination of title or survey discloses any defects in title or matters of survey then Buyer shall so notify Seller by the end of the Inspection Period (\"Buyer's Objection Notice\"). Seller, within thirty (30) days of receipt of Buyer's Objection Notice, shall notify Buyer in writing (\"Seller's Cure Notice\") of any actions Seller intends to take and the anticipated effect on the matters to which Buyer has objected. In the event Seller informs Buyer in Seller's Cure Notice that Seller is unable or unwilling to cure any objections raised in Buyer's Objection Notice, or in the event Seller does not deliver Seller's Cure Notice, Buyer shall be entitled to, prior to a date that is ten (10) days after Buyer's receipt of Seller's Cure Notice, or if Seller does not give Buyer a Seller's Cure Notice, a date that is thirty (30) days after Seller's receipt of Buyer's Objection Notice, either (i) terminate this Agreement and receive the return of the Deposits, including all interest and income earned thereon, or (ii) waive such objection and proceed to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Similarly, if Seller elects to cure the defects raised by Buyer, but is unable to do so within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the Inspection Period, Buyer shall be entitled to, either (x) terminate the Agreement and receive a return of the Deposits, including all interest and income earned thereon; (y) delay the Closing Date by a certain number days to allow Seller -3- ATTACHMENT-2B 48 additional time to cure such defects; or (z) waive such uncured objections and proceed to close the transaction. If Buyer does not give Seller notice within the foregoing period that it elects to terminate this Agreement as aforesaid, Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to accept title and waive its objections. With respect to matters first brought to Buyer's attention in a revised title commitment or survey delivered on or after the expiration of the Inspection Period, Buyer shall have five (5) business days following receipt of such revised title commitment or survey to notify Seller of any objections thereto; otherwise such new matters shall also be deemed to be approved by Buyer. As used herein, the term \"Permitted Exceptions\" shall be comprised of (a) legal highways, zoning and building ordinances and taxes and assessments which are a lien on the Closing Date, but not yet due and payable, (b) those exceptions to title disclosed in the Preliminary Title Report which are not included in Buyer's Objection Notice, and (c) those title exceptions in Buyer's Objection Notice which Buyer subsequently waives pursuant to the terms of this Section 4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4, at or before the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be discharged (or remedy by waiver or special title endorsement acceptable to Buyer) all financing encumbrances; mechanics', materialmen's and supplier's liens; judgment and sales tax liens; and UCC security interests, financing statements, and liens encumbering Seller's interest in the Property. If Seller fails or is unable to do so, Buyer may terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of all Deposits or may accept tide subject to such matters and deduct the amount of the indebtedness secured by such liens from the Purchase Price. 5. CONDEMNATION; CASUALTY If condemnation proceedings are commenced against the Property or any portion thereof, or if any governmental authority notifies Seller of its intent to acquire the Property or any portion thereof prior to Closing, Buyer shall have the right to (a) negotiate and sell to the appropriating authority or contest the appropriation, in which event Buyer shall be entitled to all proceeds thereof, and Seller shall convey subject to such proceedings and receive the Purchase Price (without deduction for condemnation proceeds) at Closing (subject to the credits provided for herein); (b) allow Seller to negotiate and sell to the appropriating authority or to contest the appropriation and be entitled to all proceeds thereof, in which event Buyer shall be entitled to a reduction in the Purchase Price equal to such proceeds; or (c) terminate this Agreement, in which event Buyer shall receive a return of the Deposits and each party shall be released from all further obligations and liability hereunder. Buyer's election shall be exercised by written notice given to Seller and Escrow Agent within thirty (30) days after Buyer has received written notice of such governmental action from Seller. Buyer's failure to deliver such notice shall constitute an election of clause (c) above. 6. SURVEY AND INVESTIGATIONS; AS IS After the Effective Date, Buyer and its employees, designated agents, lenders, prospective or actual tenants, and investors (collectively, \"Entrants\") may enter the Property, at reasonable times, for the purpose of satisfying Buyer's Contingencies (as defined in Section 7), -4- ATTACHMENT-2B 49 provided that such operations are at Buyer's sole expense and do not damage the Property. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer in its investigations and applications to governmental authorities and in its efforts to satisfy any contingencies with respect to its development of the Project, including the execution of related documentation. Seller will also assist Buyer with all required site plan and design approvals. Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and holds it harmless from and against any damage or injury that may result from Buyer's Inspections; provided, however, that Buyer's obligation to indemnify Seller hereunder shall not apply to situations involving the negligence or willful misconduct by Seller or its agents, and/or the presence of preexisting environmental contaminants on the Property.

BUYER EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, IN CONSIDERATION OF THE AGREEMENTS OF SELLER HEREIN, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF CONDITION, HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY, TENANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT BUYER IS RELYING SOLELY ON ITS OWN INVESTIGATION OF THE PROPERTY AND NOT ON ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED OR TO BE PROVIDED BY SELLER. BUYER FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED OR TO BE PROVIDED WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY WAS OBTAINED FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES AND THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER (X) HAS NOT MADE ANY INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OR VERIFICATION OF SUCH INFORMATION AND (Y) MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF SUCH INFORMATION. 7. CONTINGENCIES Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the following items (collectively, the \"Buyer's Contingencies\") have not been satisfied in favor of and to Buyer's complete satisfaction, as determined by Buyer at any time prior to the Closing, Buyer -5- ATTACHMENT-2B 50 shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement, whereupon all refundable monies deposited by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall be returned to Buyer and monies rendered non- refundable shall be remitted to Seller.

The Repurchase Option set forth herein shall automatically cease and terminate when (i) Buyer or its nominee Commences Construction, (ii) if Seller tenders an Initial Repurchase Notice and Buyer Commences Construction within the Cure Period, or (iii) the Repurchase Option is deemed waived, all without any further action on any part of the parties hereto; provided, however, that Seller shall, upon the request of Buyer, at Buyer's cost, execute a termination agreement in recordable form terminating the Repurchase Option and shall deliver the same to Buyer. (c) If Seller exercises the Repurchase Option in accordance with the terms hereof and a Repurchase Event occurs, then the consummation of such transaction (the \"Re-Purchase Closing Date\") will occur at the offices of the Title Company or such other title company that Seller may select, on that date which is sixty (60) days after the date of Buyer's Response or the Final Repurchase Notice, as the case may be, or such earlier date upon which Seller and Buyer agree.

Seller shall deliver the Repurchase Price to the Title Company in cash or other funds available for immediate credit to Buyer. Transfer taxes, deed stamps and other closing costs shall be paid as described in Section 8 with respect to Buyer's acquisition of the Property. -13- ATTACHMENT-2B 58 (e) The terms and conditions of this Section shall survive the Closing Date, shall be binding upon Buyer and its successors and assigns, and shall benefit Seller and its successors and assigns. 25.

This application was originally filed on November 12, 2015 and approved by the Health Facilities & Services Review Board on March 29, 2016 (Project No. 15-051). At that time there was a need for 141 general long-term care beds in Health Service Area 9, Will County Planning Area. Since that time the bed need has increased by 274 additional beds which is in addition to the 140 approved beds in Project #15-051. The original project's abandonment is contingent upon the approval of this proposed project. Thus, upon approval, the net change in bed need will be only 26 beds (current need: 273 -166 proposed beds =107 + the original 140 beds returned from the existing inventory = 247). It should be noted that the previous Inventory (2015) utilized 2013 base year data and the current Inventory (2017) utilized 2015 data and projects need through 2020. Because of the strong demand and need for additional beds ; this Applicant is refiling their application to increase the size of the previously approved project by 26 additional beds, which adds to the square footage of the facility by 2,400 gross square feet. This project's net effect to the bed need will only be 26 beds (248 resultant bed need). The proposed project will establish a 166-bed nursing care facility in New Lenox, Will County, Illinois. This project's addition of 26 beds addresses the current bed need (274 beds) for Health Service Area 9, Will County Planning Area, as published in the January 10, 2018 Update to the 2017 Illinois Department of Public Health (hereafter known as IDPH) Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations, Volume 2, Parts VI-VI!, Long- Term Care Services. This project will increase access for nursing care as all proposed nursing beds will be certified for both Medicare and Medicaid. Improved accessibility for nursing care ATTACHMENT-10 75 SECTION II\u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS C0ntInuOd II services will be provided to residents of the market area, i.e., a 30-minute travel time from the proposed site. Specifically, this proposed I66-bed nursing care facility will include 114 general skilled care beds and 52 Alzheimer Disease & Related Dementia (ADRD) beds which will provide care under the skilled care (SNF) license. The general long-term care unit will be housed in a three-story, 114-bed building (Alden Estates of New Lenox) where the physical and occupational therapy departments will be located. The 52 ADRD beds will be housed in a separate and distinct building (although connected). This one-story memory care facility (Alden Courts of New Lenox) will provide secure courtyards as well as a separate therapy area. Three levels of care serving three stages of the disease will be provided within two wings or \"neighborhoods\". The first neighborhood will provide care for early stage ADRD residents, as well as those in the mid-stages of the disease; these residents typically respond the best to programming and activities. The second neighborhood will serve late-stage ADRD residents who have medical needs that outweigh their programmatic needs. Not only has it been found that separating these groups is very important for the early and mid-stage residents, allowing for greatest longevity in the earlier stages, but it is equally important to separate residents who have memory impairments from those who are physically frail. As the proposed project is to be located in New Lenox, it should be noted that there are no long-term care facilities in New Lenox, Illinois. New Lenox Zip Code Area 60451 has a population of 34,063 according to the 2010 U.S. Census. This represents an increase of nearly 25 percent (24.6%) over the 2000 U.S. Census population of 27,338. Nearly 9 percent (2,968 persons) of the 2010 New Lenox Zip Code Area 60451 population is age 65 or older, and that statistic has grown by nearly 61 percent (60.8%) from over 1,800 people (1,846) 65 years of age and over in the 2000 U.S. Census. Therefore, by providing nursing care services to an ATTACHMENT-10 76 SECTION II\u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued iii immediate area where none exist, and in which a population is present to more than support the proposed service, implicitly documents that health care will be improved for the market area population. . ...

Therefore, the Village of New Lenox and its associated Zip Code area have an adverse accessibility issue as they have no beds, yet they have the population to support said beds. As such, the proposed project has been strategically located not only for the care and well-being of the market area but of the immediate community of New Lenox. The proposed site is located in Will County. just East of Joliet. The State's new Inventory (2017 IDPH Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations, Volume 2, Parts VI-VII, Long-Term Care Services) shows a path of growth in terms of need for additional nursing care services for Will County that has increases from 141 additional beds needed to the current need of 274 additional beds needed. This presumes that all beds in the existing inventory of beds approved are operating at the State's optimal rate of 90% including the Applicant's 140 already approved beds (15-051). This revised need will provide health services that will improve accessibility for nursing care services and Alzheimer's care to the residents of the market area, i.e., a 30-minute travel time from the proposed site as well as within the community of New Lenox. ATTACHMENT-10 77 SECTION II \u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued iv It is important to point out that the 166-nursing bed license covers several specific services/populations. There will be two distinct settings on this campus. The first building (not in any particular order) is Alden Estates of New Lenox. It is the three-story I14-bed general nursing bed structure. In addition to the general geriatric nursing services, the rehab unit will be located within this building near the physical and occupational therapy department. The other building, Alden Courts of New Lenox will provide 52 nursing and rehabilitation beds to care for the specialized memory care population many of whom suffer with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) care. The memory care building will be specifically designed around the \"Alden - memory care programming and; therefore, will be in a separate and distinct building (although connected). This one-story memory care facility (Alden Courts of New Lenox) will be serving three stages of the disease, in two wings or \"neighborhoods.\" The first neighborhood is for early to mid-stage ADRD residents who typically respond the best to programming and activities; The second neighborhood will serve late-stage ADRD residents who have medical needs that outweigh their programmatic needs. The medical needs of this later group are more prevalent, but they still do not outweigh the resident's programmatic needs. It has been found that separating these groups is very important for the early and mid-stage residents and allows for greatest longevity in the earlier stages. Equally as important as separating residents between level of care is to separate residents who have memory impairments from those who are physically frail. As the proposed project is to be located in New Lenox, it should again be noted that there are no long-term care facilities in New Lenox, Illinois. The Subject project will be adjacent to Silver Cross Hospital offering a concentration of vertically aligned services and referrals. Therefore, by providing nursing care services to an immediate area where none exist, and in ATTACHMENT-10 78 SECTION II \u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS continued v which a population is present to support the proposed service, implicitly documents that health care will be improved. 2. Define the planning area or market area. or other, per the applicant's definition. In accordance with the State's required travel time contour, the proposed market area is the 30-minute drive time contour per the 77 Illinois Administrative Code, Chapter II, Subchapter a, Section 1100.510(d). Moreover, the project is to be located in New Lenox, Illinois of which there are no long-term care facilities within nearly 5 miles (equivalent of 10-minute travel time contour). 3. Identify the existing problems or issues that need to be addressed. as applicable and appropriate for the proiect. There is an identified need for 274 additional nursing care beds and services in Health Service Area 9, Will County Planning Area which is in addition to the 140 already permitted beds (15-051). This project addresses that existing identified need. Ratio of Population to Nursing Beds Comparison -2015 DATA FROM 2017 INVENTORY PUBLISHED 09/01/2017 2015 Est. 2020 Est.

The proposed project seeks to establish nursing beds in the New Lenox Zip Code area that has over 34,000 (34,063) people and 2.968 over the age of 65. Even with the proposed 166-bed nursing facility, the ratio of population (65+) to nursing beds is only second to Kendall County Planning Area ATTACHMENT-10 79 SECTION II\u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued vi whose over 65 population was projected to grow by 60%, as compared to the impressive over 36% increase in the Will County Planning Area. Therefore, the issue is the lack of accessibility to nursing services in New Lenox as well as for the thirty-minute travel time contour (primary and secondary market areas). 4.

Detail how the proiect will address or improve the previously referenced issues, as well as the population's health status and well-being. The proposed facility, in reality, is the combination of two facilities: the first is a 114-bed general long-term care facility with a concentration in rehabilitation; and the second, a 52-bed nursing facility dedicated to ADRD care in its three levels of the disease. The proposed project also addresses the immediate need for nursing beds just with the community of New Lenox, Will County, as the issue of accessibility, as defined in the 2017 IDPH Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations, Volume2, Parts VI-VII, Long-Term Care which calculates an existing need for 274 additional nursing care beds which is in addition to the already permitted 140 beds (15-051). Appended as ATTACHMENT-10J, are five (5) physician letters of support stating that it is their intent to provide referrals should openings be available. It should be noted that these letters provide that collectively in the most recent 12 months 1,320 referrals have been made to area nursing facilities. Specifically, for the proposed project, these same physicians have indicated that they could make referrals of 120 patients per month for the general geriatric ATTACHMENT-10 81 SECTION II \u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued AO nursing beds and 10 monthly referrals to the specialized ADRD nursing unit. On an annual basis these referrals account for 1,200 and 120 referrals to the respective nursing units of the proposed Alden Estates-Courts of New Lenox. The important point is that accessibility will be greatly improved. 6. Provide goals with quantified and measurable objectives, with specific timeframes that relate to achieving the stated goals as appropriate. This project's goal is to serve and provide general long-term care services and innovative (ADRD) long-term care services to the geriatric population of those within the Will County Planning Area. The goal will be measured by the Applicant's ability to continuously fill its beds and provide the proposed services. For projects involving modernization, describe the conditions being upgraded if any. For facility projects, include statements of age and condition and regulatory citations if any. For equipment being replaced, include repair and maintenance records. Since this proposed project is for the establishment and construction of a facility and does not involve modernization, this item is not applicable.

Creating a home like-environment provides the residents with a sense of familiarity, comfort, and love. Providing the residents with a pleasant, memory evoking, home-like environment can further help to decrease symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and dementias, such as agitation, anxiety, lack of enthusiasm, and aggravation. Furthermore, this program is dedicated to providing an environment that helps to stimulate and maintain a resident's level of cognitive functioning. Furthermore, staff develop relationships with patience, compassion and love. Dementia Care Units are secure, and promote safety, health, and wellbeing. Pathways Memory Care Program The Pathways Program is divided into three life skills/activity programming areas to capture the variety of cognitive levels that are exhibited on the dementia care units. They are as follows: Memory Strengthening Program The Memory Path Program is a program dedicated to those residents who are a high level of cognitive functioning. These residents may score high on cognitive testing, alert and oriented to the unit, staf, family, and other residents; they understand the structure of the Pathways Program. This program provides the following: Engagement: This part of the program places emphasis of having residents assists other residents. These residents help to run activities, such as Bingo, JackPot, trivia, exercise, etc. These residents may enjoy helping to decorate for holidays, help hand out clothing protectors at meals, etc. This part of the program gives a resident a sense of belonging and helpfulness to others. Enhancement: This part of the program focuses on memory enhancement These residents participate in memory/mind games, reading, trivia, etc, that help to maintain their knowledge and stimulate the mind. They may also participate in reminiscence and life skill activities. This program may be task oriented, with supervision rather than hands on assistance. Evoking: This part of the program also has a resident meeting, where the residents meet and discuss what activities they would like to see the dementia care unit These residents also are given structure, but they are encouraged to still make ATTACHMENT-10F 90 choices as so what they would like to be active in and what they would like to do to participate. The purpose of this portion of the program is to bring out their talents, abilities, choices, and individuality. Memory Path Program: The Memory Path Program is for those residents who require support and memory evoking programming in order to find a \"path: to their memories and emotions. These residents may have cognitive function varying more often; require more assistance with activities of daily living, redirection and support. The Memory Path Program Provides the following: Engagement: This level of the program is dedicated to providing person centered engagement. Understanding the best cues and redirection techniques are key to maximizing participation and creating a connection with the program taking place. Furthermore, staff must understand the best approaches may vary day to day or even minute to minute. Enhancement: This level of the program is dedicated to enhancing residents' emotions and sensory stimulation. Sights, sounds, smells are incorporated into their routine. Stimulating feelings within our residents can help to access memories and emotions that require stimulation to make a connection to their memories. Types of activities include baking, reminiscing, where many senses are stimulated at once. Evoking: The program focus is to evoke emotions, feelings, sensations. This part of the program does stress that at any time of the day, during any activity, the staff can evoke feelings of care and comfort in our residents. The Emotion Path Program The emotions plan program is a link to emotions that stimulate feelings and/or memories. This is important throughout stages of programming for Alzheimer's; however this program emphasizes the senses, as residents abilities to demonstrate understanding and communicate their needs is limited to none in this stage. Engagement: Resident Engagement is created by stimulating the senses. Sensory stimulation and programming is an aspect of all three programs; however in this activity program engagement is developed through response of sight, sound, touch, taste and smell. The focus is on stimulating the five senses daily; examples of these activities are taste testing, music, hand massages, etc. The use of Montessori activities are also used, to maintain abilities the residents still can maintain (for example, wrapping yarn around a soda bottle can help maintain the ability to move the hand). ATTACHMENT-10F 91 Enhancement: This level of the program uses engagement of the senses to evoke memories. Feelings are not affected by the disease, and emotions/feelings are used to evoke those feelings. Evoking: This part of the program is about providing emotional support and love to our residents. These are the \"unscheduled\" moments were staff provide hugs, touch, and care, to evoke pleasant moments.

This report frequently cites statistics that apply to individuals with dementia regardless of the cause.

A Note About Terminology As discussed in the overview (see pages 4-16). under the 1984 diagnostic guidelines, an individual with Alzheimer's disease must have symptoms of dementia. In contrast, under the proposed revised guidelines of 2011, Alzheimer's disease encompasses an entire continuum from the initial pathologic changes in the brain before symptoms appear through the dementia caused by the accumulation of brain changes. This means that Alzheimer's disease includes not only those with dementia due to the disease, but also those with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's and asymptomatic individuals who have verified biomarkers of Alzheimer's. As a result, what was \"Alzheimer's disease\" under the 1984 guidelines is now more accurately labeled, under the 2011 guidelines. as \"dementia due to Alzheimer's\" or \"Alzheimer's dementia\" \u2014 one stage in the continuum of the disease. This edition of Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures reflects this change in understanding and terminology. That is. the term \"Alzheimer's disease\" is now used only in those instances that refer to the underlying disease and/or the entire continuum of the disease. The term \"Alzheimer's dementia\" is used to describe those in the dementia stage of the continuum. Thus. in most instances where past editions of the report used \"Alzheimer's disease:' the current edition now uses \"Alzheimer's dementia.\" The data examined are the same and are comparable across years \u2014 only the way of describing the affected population has changed. For example, 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures reported that 5.4 million individuals in the United States had \"Alzheimer's disease.\" The 2017 edition reports that 5.5 million individuals have \"Alzheimer's dementia.\" These prevalence estimates are comparable: they both identify the number of individuals who are in the dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease. The only thing that has changed is the term used to describe their condition.

The characteristic symptoms of dementia are difficulties with memory, language, problem- solving and other cognitive skills that affect a person's ability to perform everyday activities. These difficulties occur because nerve cells (neurons) in parts of the brain involved in cognitive function have been damaged or destroyed. In Alzheimer's disease, neurons in other parts of the brain are eventually damaged or destroyed as well, including those that enable a person to carry out basic bodily functions such as walking and swallowing. People in the final stages of the disease are bed-bound and require around-the-clock care. Alzheimer's disease is ultimately fatal. Dementia When an individual has symptoms of dementia, a physician will conduct tests to identify the cause. Different causes of dementia are associated with distinct symptom patterns and brain abnormalities, as described in Table 1 (see pages 6-7). Studies show that many people with dementia symptoms, especially those in the older age groups. have brain abnormalities associated with more than one cause of dementia?' In some cases, individuals with symptoms of dementia do not actually have dementia, but instead have a condition whose symptoms mimic those of dementia. Common causes of dementia-like symptoms are depression, delirium, side effects from medications, thyroid problems. certain vitamin deficiencies and excessive use of alcohol. Unlike dementia, these conditions often may be reversed with treatment. One meta-analysis, a method of analysis in which results of multiple studies are examined, reported that 9 percent of people with dementia-like symptoms did not in fact have dementia, but had other conditions that were potentially reversible.' Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease was first described in 1906, but about 70 years passed before it was recognized as a common cause of dementia and a major cause of death? Not until then did Alzheimer's disease become a significant area of research. Although the research that followed has revealed a great deal about Alzheimer's. much is yet to be discovered about the precise biological changes that cause the disease, why it progresses more quickly in some than in others, and how the disease can be prevented, slowed or stopped. Symptoms The differences between typical age-related cognitive changes and signs of Alzheimer's can be subtle (see Table 2, page 9). Just as individuals are different, so are the Alzheimer's symptoms they may experience. The most common initial symptom is a gradually worsening ability to remember new information. This occurs ATTACHMENT-10G 99 Overview of Alzheimer's Disease 5 TABLE 1 Causes of Dementia and Associated Characteristics* Cause Characteristics Alzheimer's disease Most common cause of dementia: accounts for an estimated 60 percent to 80 percent of cases. Autopsy studies show that about half of these cases involve solely Alzheimer's pathology: many of the remaining cases have evidence of additional pathologic changes related to other dementias. This is called mixed pathology, and if recognized during life is called mixed dementia. Difficulty remembering recent conversations, names or events is often an early clinical symptom; apathy and depression are also often early symptoms. Later symptoms include impaired communication, disorientation, confusion, poor judgment. behavior changes and, ultimately, difficulty speaking. swallowing and walking. Revised guidelines for diagnosing Alzheimer's were proposed and published in 2011 (see pages 15-16). They recommend that Alzheimer's be considered a slowly progressive brain disease that begins well before clinical symptoms emerge. The hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's are the progressive accumulation of the protein fragment beta-amyloid (plagues) outside neurons in the brain and twisted strands of the protein tau (tangles) inside neurons. These changes are eventually accompanied by the damage and death of neurons. Vascular dementia Previously known as multi-infarct or post-stroke dementia. vascular dementia is less common as a sole cause of dementia than Alzheimer's. accounting for about 10 percent of dementia cases. However. it is very common as a mixed pathology in older individuals with Alzheimer's dementia, about 50 percent of whom have pathologic evidence of infarcts (silent strokes).\" Impaired judgment or impaired ability to make decisions, plan or organize is more likely to be the initial symptom. as opposed to the memory loss often associated with the initial symptoms of Alzheimer's. In addition to changes in cognition. people with vascular dementia can have difficulty with motor function. especially slow gait and poor balance. Vascular dementia occurs most commonly from blood vessel blockage or damage leading to infarcts (strokes) or bleeding in the brain. The location, number and size of the brain injuries determine whether dementia will result and how the individual's thinking and physical functioning will be affected. In the past, evidence of vascular dementia was used to exclude a diagnosis of Alzheimer's (and vice versa). That practice is no longer considered consistent with the pathologic evidence. which shows that the brain changes of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia commonly coexist. When there is clinical evidence of two or more causes of dementia. the individual is considered to have mixed dementia. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB} People with DLB have some of the symptoms common in Alzheimer's, but are more likely to have initial or early symptoms of sleep disturbances, well-formed visual hallucinations, and slowness, gait imbalance or other parkinsonian movement features. These features, as well as early visuospatial impairment. may occur in the absence of significant memory impairment. Lewy bodies are abnormal aggregations (or clumps) of the protein alpha-synuclein in neurons. When they develop in a part of the brain called the cortex, dementia can result Alpha-synuclein also aggregates in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease (PD), in which it is accompanied by severe neuronal loss in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra. While people with DLB and PD both have Lewy bodies, the onset of the disease is marked by motor impairment in PD and cognitive impairment in DLB. The brain changes of DLB alone can cause dementia, but very commonly people with DLB have coexisting Alzheimer's pathology. In people with both DLB and Alzheimer's pathology, symptoms of both diseases may emerge and lead to some confusion in diagnosis. Vascular dementia can also coexist and contribute to the dementia. When evidence of more than one dementia is recognized during life, the individual is said to have mixed dementia. ATTACHMENT-10G 6 Alzheimer's Association. 2017 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figuienheimers Dement 2017;13:325-373. TABLE I front.) Causes of Dementia and Associated Characteristics . Cause Characteristics Mixed dementia Characterized by the hallmark abnormalities of more than one cause of dementia \u2014 most commonly Alzheimer's combined with vascular dementia, followed by Alzheimer's with DLB. and Alzheimer's with vascular dementia and DLB. Vascular dementia with DLB is much less common.' Recent studies suggest that mixed dementia is more common than previously recognized, with about half of older people with dementia having pathologic evidence of more than one cause of dementia. 4i5Recent studies also show that the likelihood of having mixed dementia increases with age and is highest in the oldest-old (people age 85 or older). Fronto- temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) Includes clemencies aphasia. Pick's disease. corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy. Typical early symptoms include marked changes in personality and behavior and/or difficulty with producing or comprehending language. Unlike Alzheimer's, memory is typically spared in the early stages of disease. Nerve cells in the front (frontal lobe) and side regions (temporal lobes) of the brain are especially affected, and these regions become markedly atrophied (shrunken). In addition, the upper layers of the cortex typically become soft and spongy and have abnormal protein inclusions (usually tau protein or the transactive response DNA-binding protein). The symptoms of FTLD may occur in those age 65 years and older, similar to Alzheimer's, but most people with FTLD develop symptoms at a younger age. About 60 percent of people with FTLD are ages 45 to 60. FTLD accounts for about 10 percent of dementia cases. Parkinson's disease (PD) Problems with movement (slowness, rigidity, tremor and changes in gait) are common symptoms of PD. In PD. alpha-synuclein aggregates appear in an area deep in the brain called the substantia nigra. The aggregates are thought to cause degeneration of the nerve cells that produce dopamine. The incidence of PD is about one-tenth that of Alzheimer's. As PD progresses. it often results in dementia secondary to the accumulation of Lewy bodies in the cortex (similar to DLB) or the accumulation of beta-amyloid clumps and tau tangles (similar to Alzheimer's). Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease This very rare and rapidly fatal disorder impairs memory and coordination and causes behavior changes. Results from a misfolded protein (prion) that causes other proteins throughout the brain to misfold and malfunction. May be hereditary (caused by a gene that runs in ones family). sporadic (unknown cause) or caused by a known prion infection. A specific form called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is believed to be caused by consumption of products from cattle affected by mad cow disease. Normal pressure hydrocephalus Symptoms include difficulty walking, memory loss and inability to control urination. Accounts for less than 5 percent of dementia cases.' ) Caused by impaired reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid and the consequent buildup of fluid in the brain, increasing pressure in the brain. People with a history of brain hemorrhage (particularly subarachnoid hemorrhage) and meningitis are at increased risk. Can sometimes be corrected with surgical installation of a shunt in the brain to drain excess fluid. * For more information on these and other causes of dementia, visit alz.org/dementia. ATTACHMENT-1 OG Overview of Alzheimer's Disease 7 101 because the first neurons to be damaged and destroyed are usually in brain regions involved in forming new memories. As neurons in other parts of the brain are damaged and destroyed, individuals experience other difficulties, including neurobehavioral symptoms such as agitation, sleeplessness and delusions. The pace at which symptoms advance from mild to moderate to severe varies from person to person. As the disease progresses. cognitive and functional abilities decline. In the more advanced stages, people need help with basic activities of daily living, such as bathing. dressing, eating and using the bathroom; lose their ability to communicate; and become bed-bound and reliant on around-the-clock care. When individuals have difficulty moving, they are more vulnerable to infections, including pneumonia (infection of the lungs). Alzheimer's-related pneumonia often contributes to the death of people with Alzheimer's disease. When Alzheimer's destroys cells in the areas of the brain that control swallowing, an individual becomes vulnerable to death by Alzheimer's- related malnutrition and dehydration. Diagnosis There is no single test for Alzheimer's. Instead. physicians, often with the help of specialists such as neurologists and geriatricians. use a variety of approaches and tools to help make a diagnosis. They include the following: Obtaining a medical and family history from the individual, including psychiatric history and history of cognitive and behavioral changes. Asking a family member to provide input about changes in thinking skills and behavior. Conducting cognitive tests and physical and neurologic examinations. Having the individual undergo blood tests and brain imaging to rule out other potential causes of dementia symptoms, such as a tumor or certain vitamin deficiencies. Diagnosing Alzheimer's requires a careful and comprehensive medical evaluation. Although physicians can almost always determine if a person has dementia, it may be difficult to identify the exact cause. Several days or weeks may be needed for the individual to complete the required tests and examinations and for the physician to interpret the results and make a diagnosis. Brain Changes Associated with Alzheimer's Disease A healthy adult brain has about 100 billion neurons, each with long, branching extensions. These extensions enable individual neurons to form connections with other neurons. At such connections, called synapses, information flows in tiny bursts of chemicals that are released by one neuron and detected by a receiving neuron. The brain contains about 100 trillion synapses. They allow signals to travel rapidly through the brain's neuronal circuits, creating the cellular basis of memories, thoughts, sensations, emotions, movements and skills. The accumulation of the protein fragment beta-amyloid (called beta-a myloid plaques) outside neurons and the accumulation of an abnormal form of the protein tau (called tau tangles) inside neurons are two of several brain changes associated with Alzheimer's. Beta- amyloid plaques are believed to contribute to cell death by interfering with neuron-to-neuron communication at synapses. while tau tangles block the transport of nutrients and other essential molecules inside neurons. The brains of people with advanced Alzheimer's disease show inflammation, dramatic shrinkage from cell loss. and widespread debris from dead and dying neurons. Research suggests that the brain changes associated with Alzheimer's may begin 20 or more years before symptoms appear.\"'\" When the initial changes occur. the brain compensates for them, enabling individuals to continue to function normally. As neuronal damage increases, the brain can no longer compensate for the changes and individuals show subtle cognitive decline. Later, neuronal damage is so significant that individuals show obvious cognitive decline, including symptoms such as memory loss or confusion as to time or place. Later still, basic bodily functions such as swallowing are impaired. While research settings have the tools and expertise to identify some of the early brain changes of Alzheimer's, additional research is needed to fine-tune the tools' ATTACHMENT-10G 2017;13325-373. TABLE 2 Signs of Alzheimer's or Other Dementias Compared with Typical Age-Related Changes* Signs of Alzheimer's or Other Dementia s Typical Age-Related Changes Memory loss that disrupts daily life: One of the most common signs of Alzheimer's is memory loss. especially forgetting recently learned information. Others include forgetting important dates or events, asking for the same information over and over, and increasingly needing to rely on memory aids (e.g., reminder notes or electronic devices) or family members for things that used to be handled on one's own. Sometimes forgetting names or appointments, but remembering them later. Challenges in planning or solving problems: Some people experience changes in their ability to develop and follow a plan or work with numbers. They may have trouble following a familiar recipe, keeping track of monthly bills or counting change. They may have difficulty concentrating and take much longer to do things than they did before. Making occasional errors when balancing a checkbook. Difficulty completing familiar tasks at home, at work or at leisure: People with Alzheimer's often find it hard to complete daily tasks. Sometimes, people have trouble driving to a familiar location, managing a budget at work or remembering the rules of a favorite game. Occasionally needing help to use the settings on a microwave or record a television show. Confusion with time or place: People with Alzheimer's can lose track of dates, seasons and the passage of time. They may have trouble understanding something if it is not happening immediately. Sometimes they forget where they are or how they got there. Getting confused about the day of the week but figuring it out later. Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships: For some people. having vision problems is a sign of Alzheimer's. They may have difficulty reading, judging distance and determining color or contrast, which may cause problems with driving, Vision changes related to cataracts, glaucoma or age- related macular degeneration. New problems with words in speaking or writing: People with Alzheimer's may have trouble following or joining a conversation. They may stop in the middle of a conversation and have no idea how to continue or they may repeat themselves. They may struggle with vocabulary, have problems finding the right word or call things by the wrong name (e.g.. calling a watch a \"hand clock\"). Sometimes having trouble finding the right word, Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps: People with Alzheimer's may put things in unusual places. and lose things and be unable to go back over their steps to find them again, Sometimes. they accuse others of stealing. This may occur more frequently over time. Misplacing things from time to time and retracing steps l to find them. Decreased or poor judgment: People with Alzheimer's may experience changes in judgment or decision-making. For example, they may use poor judgment when dealing with money, giving large amounts to telemarketers. They may pay less attention to grooming or keeping themselves clean. Making a bad decision once in a while. Withdrawal from work or social activities: People with Alzheimer's may start to remove themselves from hobbies, social activities, work projects or sports. They may have trouble keeping up with a favorite sports team or remembering how to complete a favorite hobby. They may also avoid being social because of the changes they have experienced. Sometimes feeling weary of work, family and social obligations. Changes in mood and personality: The mood and personalities of people with Alzheimer's can change. They can become confused, suspicious, depressed, fearful or anxious. They may be easily upset at home. at work, with friends or in places where they are out of their comfort zones, Developing very specific ways of doing things and becoming irritable when a routine is disrupted.

In addition, treatments to prevent, slow or stop these changes are not yet available, although many are being tested in clinical trials. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI): A Potential Precursor to Alzheimer's and Other Dementias MCI is a condition in which an individual has mild but measurable changes in thinking abilities that are noticeable to the person affected and to family members and friends, but do not affect the individual's ability to carry out everyday activities. Approximately 15 percent to 20 percent of people age 65 or older have MCI. 16 People with MCI. especially MCI involving memory problems, are more likely to develop Alzheimer's or other dementias than people without MCI. 17-18 A systematic review of 32 studies found that an average of 32 percent of individuals with MCI developed Alzheimer's dementia in 5 years.\" This is similar to a meta-analysis of 41 studies that found that among individuals with MCI who were tracked for 5 years or longer. an average of 38 percent developed dementia. 18 Identifying which individuals with MCI are more likely to develop Alzheimer's or other dementias is a major goal of current research. Revised guidelines for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease that were published in 2011 20'21 (see pages 15-16) suggest that in some cases MCI is actually an early stage of Alzheimer's (called MCI due to Alzheimer's disease) or another form of dementia. However, MCI can develop for reasons other than Alzheimer's, and MCI does not always lead to dementia. In some individuals, MCI reverts to normal cognition or remains stable. In other cases, such as when a medication causes cognitive impairment. MCI is mistakenly diagnosed. Therefore, it's important that people experiencing cognitive impairment seek help as soon as possible for diagnosis and possible treatment. Genetic Abnormalities Associated with Alzheimer's Certain genetic mutations and the extra copy of chromosome 21 that characterizes Down syndrome are uncommon genetic changes that affect the risk of Alzheimer's. There are also common variations in genes that affect the risk of Alzheimer's (see APOE-e4, page 11). Genetic Mutations A small percentage of Alzheimer's cases (an estimated 1 percent or less)\" develop as a result of mutations to any of three specific genes. A genetic mutation is an abnormal change in the sequence of chemical pairs that make up genes. These mutations involve the gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the genes for the presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 proteins. Those inheriting a mutation to the APP or presenilin 1 genes are guaranteed to develop Alzheimer's. Those inheriting a mutation to the presenilin 2 gene have a 95 percent chance of developing the disease. 25 Individuals with mutations in any of these three genes tend to develop Alzheimer's symptoms before age 65. sometimes as early as age 30, while the vast majority of individuals with Alzheimer's have late-onset disease, in which symptoms become apparent at age 65 or later. Down Syndrome About 400.000 Americans have Down syndrome.\" In Down syndrome. an individual is born with an additional copy of chromosome 21, one of the 23 human chromosomes. Scientists are not certain why people with Down syndrome are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's, but it may be related to the additional copy of chromosome 21. This chromosome includes a gene that encodes for the production of APP, which in people with Alzheimer's is cut into beta-amyloid fragments that accumulate into plaques. Having an extra copy of chromosome 21 may increase the amount of beta-amyloid fragments in the brain. By age 40, most people with Down syndrome have significant levels of beta-a myloid plaques and tau tangles in their brains.\" As with all adults, advancing age increases the likelihood that a person with Down syndrome will exhibit symptoms of Alzheimer's. According to the National Down Syndrome Society. about 30 percent of people with Down syndrome who are in their 50s have Alzheimer's dementia.\" Fifty percent or more of people with Down syndrome will develop Alzheimer's dementia as they age.\" ATTACHMENT- I OG 10 2017 Alzheimer's and Figienheimers Dement 2017:13:325-373. Risk Factors for Alzheimer's With the exception of cases of Alzheimer's caused by genetic abnormalities, experts believe that Alzheimer's, like other common chronic diseases, develops as a result of multiple factors rather than a single cause. Age, Family History and the Apolipoprotein E (APOE)-e4 Gene The greatest risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's are older age.\" -\" having a family history of Alzheimer's\" -35 and carrying the APOE-e4 gene. 36-\" Agg Age is the greatest of these three risk factors, with the vast majority of people with Alzheimer's dementia being age 65 or older As noted in the Prevalence section (see pages 17-25). the percentage of people with Alzheimer's dementia increases dramatically with age: 3 percent of people age 65-74,17 percent of people age 75-84. and 32 percent of people age 85 or older have Alzheimer's dementia.\" It is important to note that Alzheimer's is not a normal part of aging. and older age alone is not sufficient to cause Alzheimer's dementia. Fornily History A family history of Alzheimer's is not necessary loran individual to develop the disease. However, individuals who have a parent, brother or sister with Alzheimer's are more likely to develop the disease than those who do not have a first-degree relative with Alzheimer's.\".\" Those who have more than one first-degree relative with Alzheimer's are at even higher risk.\" When diseases run in families. heredity (genetics), shared environmental and lifestyle factors (for example. access to healthy foods and level of physical activity), or both, may play a role. The increased risk associated with having a family history of Alzheimer's is not entirely explained by whether the individual has inherited the APOE-e4 risk gene. APOE-e4 Gene The APOE gene provides the blueprint for a protein that transports cholesterol in the bloodstream. Everyone inherits one of three forms of the APOE gene \u2014 e2, e3 or e4 \u2014 from each parent. The e3 form is the most common, with 50 percent to 90 percent of individuals having one or two copies.\" The e4 form is the next most common, with 5 percent to 35 percent having one or two copies, and the e2 form is the least common. with 1 percent to 5 percent having one or two copies.\" The estimated distribution of the six possible e2, e3 and e4 pairs is shown in Table 3. Having the e4 form increases one's risk of developing Alzheimer's compared with having the e3 form, while having the e2 form may decrease one's risk compared with having the e3 form. Those who inherit one copy of the e4 form have three times the risk of developing Alzheimer's compared with those with the e3 form, while those who inherit two copies of the e4 form have an eight- to 12-fold risk. 38.41-42 In addition, those with the e4 form are more likely to develop Alzheimer's at a younger age than those with the e2 or e3 forms of the APOE gene.\" A meta-analysis including 20 published articles describing the frequency of the e4 form among people in the United States who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's found that 56 percent had one copy of the APOE-e4 gene, and 11 percent had two copies of the APOE-e4 gene.'\" Another study found that among 1,770 diagnosed individuals from 26 Alzheimer's disease centers, 65 percent had at least one copy of the APOE-e4 gene.\" C:1 11 11 Estimated Percentages of the U.S. Population with the Six Possible e2, e3 and e4 Pairs of the Apolipoprotein E Pair e2/e2 e2/e4 2 e3/e3 61 e3/e4 23 e4/e4 2 Created from data from Raber et al. 4\u00b0 Percentages do not total 100 due to rounding. ATTACHMENT- I OG Overview of Alzheimer's Disease 11 105 Unlike inheriting a genetic mutation that causes Alzheimer's, inheriting the APOE-e4 gene does not guarantee that an individual will develop Alzheimer's. This is also true for more than 20 recently identified genes that appear to affect the risk of Alzheimer's. These genes are believed to have a limited effect on the overall prevalence of Alzheimer's because they are rare or only slightly increase risk.\" Modifiable Risk Factors Although risk factors such as age and family history cannot be changed, other risk factors can be changed. or modified, to reduce risk of cognitive decline and dementia. A report\" evaluating the state of the evidence on the effects of modifiable risk factors on cognitive decline and dementia concluded that there is sufficiently strong evidence, from a population-based perspective, that regular physical activity and management of cardiovascular risk factors (especially diabetes, obesity, smoking and hypertension) reduce the risk of cognitive decline and may reduce the risk of dementia. It also concluded that there is sufficiently strong evidence that a healthy diet and lifelong learning/cognitive training may reduce the risk of cognitive decline. A report from the Institute of Medicine examined the evidence regarding modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline and reached similar conclusions.\" Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Brain health is affected by the health of the heart and blood vessels. Although it makes up just 2 percent of body weight. the brain consumes 20 percent of the body's oxygen and energy supplies. 49 A healthy heart ensures that enough blood is pumped to the brain, while healthy blood vessels enable the oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to reach the brain so it can function normally. Many factors that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease are also associated with a higher risk Of dementia. These factors include smoking. 90-\" obesity in midlife\"'\" and diabetes. 55-59 Some studies propose that impaired glucose processing (a precursor to diabetes) may also result in an increased risk for dem entia. 59.69-61 Hypertension sw-m and high cholesterol 65-69 in midlife are also implicated as risk factors for dementia. Conversely, factors that protect the heart may also protect the brain and reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's or other dementias. Physical activity 99.577\"0 appears to be one of these factors. In addition. emerging evidence suggests that consuming a diet that benefits the heart, such as one that is lower in saturated fats, may be associated with reduced Alzheimer's and dementia risk. 99.99-15 Researchers have begun studying combinations of health factors and lifestyle behaviors (for example, blood pressure and physical activity) to learn whether combinations of risk factors better identify Alzheimer's and dementia risk than individual risk factors, as well as whether intervening on multiple risk factors simultaneously has a greater chance of reducing risk than addressing a single risk factor.\" Education People with more years of formal education are at lower risk for Alzheimer's and other dementias than those with fewer years of formal education. 99-\" Some researchers believe that having more years of education builds a \"cognitive reserve\" that enables individuals to better compensate for brain changes that could result in symptoms of Alzheimer's or other dementias. 60$2'93 According to the cognitive reserve hypothesis, having more years of education increases the connections between neurons, enabling the brain to use alternate routes of neuron-to-neuron communication to complete cognitive tasks when the usual routes have neuronal gaps because of Alzheimer's. Some scientists believe other factors may contribute to or explain the increased risk of dementia among those with fewer years of formal education. These factors include an increased likelihood of having occupations that are less mentally stimulating. 94'97 In addition. having fewer years of formal education is associated with lower socioeconomic status,\" which in turn may increase one's likelihood of experiencing poor nutrition and decrease one's ability to afford health care or medical treatments, such as treatments for cardiovascular risk factors. Finally. in the United States. people with fewer years of education tend to ATTACHMENT-10G 12 Alzheimer's Association. 2017 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figuienheimers Dement 2017:13:325-373. have more cardiovascular risk factors for Alzheimer's. including being less physically active\" and having a higher risk of diabetes 66-62 and cardiovascular disease.\" Social and Cognitive Engagement Additional studies suggest that remaining socially and mentally active throughout life may support brain health and possibly reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias.\" 1\" Remaining socially and mentally active may help build cognitive reserve, but the exact mechanism by which this may occur is unknown. More research is needed to better understand how social and cognitive engagement may affect biological processes to reduce risk. Traumatic Brain lniurv (TB;) TBI is the disruption of normal brain function caused by a blow or jolt to the head or penetration of the skull by a foreign object. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 1.7 million Americans will sustain a TBI in any given year' s Falls and motor vehicle accidents are the leading causes of TBI.\" 6-1\u00b06 Two ways to classify the severity of TBI are by the duration of loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia\"' and the individual's initial score on the 15-point Glasgow Coma Scale.\" Based on these classification approaches, Mild TB! (also known as a concussion) is characterized by loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia lasting 30 minutes or less, or an initial Glasgow score of 13-15: about 75 percent of TBIs are mild.\" 6 Moderate TB/ is characterized by loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia lasting more than 30 minutes but less than 24 hours, or an initial Glasgow score of 9-12. Severe TB/ is characterized by loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia lasting 24 hours or more, or an initial Glasgow score of 8 or less. Solid evidence indicates that moderate and severe TBI increase the risk of developing certain forms of dementia.107.109-112 Those who experience repeated head injuries (such as boxers, football players and combat veterans) may be at an even higher risk of dementia, cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disease.\" 3122 Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neuropathologic diagnosis (meaning it is characterized by brain changes that can only be identified at autopsy) associated with repeated blows to the head, such as those that may occur while playing contact sports. It is also associated with the development of dementia. Currently. there is no test to determine if someone has CTE-related brain changes during life. Other than repeated brain trauma, such as TBI. the causes and risk factors for CTE remain unknown. Like Alzheimer's dementia, at autopsy, CTE is characterized by tangles of an abnormal form of the protein tau in the brain. Unlike Alzheimer's. these tangles typically appear around small blood vessels, and beta-amyloid plagues are only present in certain circumstances.'\" How the brain changes associated with CTE are linked to cognitive or behavioral dysfunction is unclear. It is thought to be caused by repetitive TBI. Individuals can decrease their risk of TBI by ensuring their living environments are well lit and free of tripping hazards, wearing seatbelts while traveling, and wearing helmets when on a bicycle, snowmobile or other open. unrestrained vehicle. Athletes and members of the military who have experienced repeated concussions may be able to prevent injury before recovery by following clinical guidelines for return to play or military duty. Treatment of Alzheimer's Dementia Pharmacologic Treatment None of the pharmacologic treatments (medications) available today for Alzheimer's dementia slows or stops the damage and destruction of neurons that cause Alzheimer's symptoms and make the disease fatal. The six drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Alzheimer's temporarily improve symptoms by increasing the amount of chemicals called neurotransmitters in the brain. A' The effectiveness of these drugs varies from person to person and is limited in duration. ATTACHMENT-10G 107 Overview of Alzheimer's Disease 13 In the decade of 2002-2012. 244 drugs for Alzheimer's were tested in clinical trials registered with clinicaltrials.gov . a National Institutes of Health registry of publicly and privately funded clinical studies.'\" Only one of the 244 drugs successfully completed clinical trials and went on to receive approval from the FDA. Many factors contribute to the difficulty of developing effective treatments for Alzheimer's. These factors include the high cost of drug development, the relatively long time needed to observe whether an investigational treatment affects disease progression, and the structure of the brain, which is protected by the blood-brain barrier, through which only very specialized small-molecule drugs can cross. Non-Pharmacologic Therapy Non-pharmacologic therapies are those that do not involve medication. Non-pharmacologic therapies are often used with the goal of maintaining or improving cognitive function, the ability to perform activities of daily living or overall quality of life. They also may be used with the goal of reducing behavioral symptoms such as depression, apathy, wandering, sleep disturbances, agitation and aggression. Examples include computerized memory training, listening to favorite music as a way to stir recall, and incorporating special lighting to lessen sleep disorders. As with current pharmacologic therapies. non-pharmacologic therapies have not been shown to alter the course of Alzheimer's disease. Reviews and meta-analyses of non-pharmacologic therapies tested in randomized controlled trials (in which participants are randomly assigned to either receive or not receive a therapy, and the results of the two groups are compared) have found that some are beneficial to people with Alzheimer's dementia. Among these are exercise' 25-226 and cognitive stimulation.'\" Specifically, a meta-analysis\" s found that aerobic exercise and a combination of aerobic and non-aerobic exercise can improve cognitive function, while a systematic review' 26 found that exercise has a positive effect on overall cognitive function and is associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer's. However, researchers caution that additional randomized controlled trials involving larger numbers of participants are needed to understand to what extent exercise may slow cognitive decline. A second systematic review\"' found that cognitive stimulation had beneficial effects on cognitive function and some aspects of well-being. Living with Alzheimer's Despite the lack of therapies that slow or stop Alzheimer's, studies have consistently shown that active management of Alzheimer's and other dementias can improve quality of life for affected individuals and their caregivers.'\"'\" \u00b0 Active management includes: Appropriate use of available treatment options. Effective management of coexisting conditions. Coordination of care among physicians. other health care professionals and lay caregivers. Participation in activities that are meaningful and bring purpose to one's life. Having opportunities to connect with others living with dementia; support groups and supportive services are examples of such opportunities.

A Modern Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease: Revised Guidelines In 2011, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Alzheimer's Association proposed revised guidelines for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. 20-\" These guidelines updated diagnostic criteria and guidelines published in 1984 by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Association, then known as the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA).\"' In 2012, the NIA and the Alzheimer's Association also developed new guidelines to help pathologists describe and categorize the brain changes associated with Alzheimer's and other dementias on autopsy. 132 Differences Between the Original and Revised Guidelines The 1984 diagnostic criteria and guidelines were based chiefly on a doctor's clinical judgment about the cause of an individual's symptoms, taking into account reports from the individual, family members and friends; results of cognitive tests; and general neurological assessment. The revised guidelines incorporate the same steps for diagnosis, but also incorporate biomarker tests. A biomarker is a biological factor that can be measured to indicate the presence or absence of disease, or the risk of developing a disease. For example. blood glucose level is a biomarker of diabetes, and cholesterol level is a biomarker of heart disease risk. Among several factors being studied as possible biomarkers for Alzheimer's are the amount of beta-amyloid in the brain as shown on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and levels of certain proteins in fluid (for example, levels of beta-amyloid and tau in the cerebrospinal fluid and levels of particular groups of proteins in blood). Finding a simple and inexpensive test, such as a blood test, to diagnose Alzheimer's would be ideal for patients. physicians and scientists. Research is underway to develop such a test, but to date, no test has shown the accuracy and reliability needed to diagnose Alzheimer's. Another difference is that the revised guidelines identify two stages of Alzheimer's disease: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the revised guidelines propose \u2014 for research purposes \u2014 a preclinical phase of Alzheimer's that occurs before symptoms such as memory loss develop. Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease: This stage is characterized by noticeable memory, thinking and behavioral symptoms that impair a person's ability to function in daily life. MCI Due to Alzheimer's Disease: People with MCI show cognitive decline greater than expected for their age and education level, but this decline does not significantly interfere with everyday activities. Approximately 15 percent to 20 percent of people age 65 or older have MCI. 16 Proposed for Research - Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease: In this proposed stage, individuals may have measurable changes in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and/or blood (biomarkers) that indicate the earliest signs of disease, but they may have not yet developed noticeable symptoms such as memory loss. This proposed ATTACHMENT-10G 109 Overview of Alzheimer's Disease 15 preclinical or presymptomatic stage reflects current thinking that Alzheimer's-related brain changes may begin 20 years or more before symptoms occur.\"'\" Ongoing research continues to explore this possible stage of the disease. In contrast, the 1984 criteria identify Alzheimer's as a disease that begins when symptoms of dementia such as memory loss are already present and have impaired an individual's ability to carry out daily tasks. Looking to the Future Many researchers believe that future treatments to slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer's disease and preserve brain function will be most effective when administered early in the disease, either at the MCI stage or during the proposed preclinical stage. - Biomarker tests will be essential to identify which individuals are in these early stages and should receive treatments that slow or stop the disease when such treatments are available. They also will be critical for monitoring the effects of treatment. Furthermore, biornarkers play an important role in developing treatments because they enable researchers to identify which individuals to enroll in clinical trials of potential new therapies. By using biomarkers, researchers can enroll only those individuals with the brain changes that treatments target.' It's important to note that the most effective biomarker test or combination of tests may differ depending on the stage of the disease and other factors.\"' For more information on the revised guidelines and their potential impact. see the Special Report (pages 61-68).

As the size and proportion of the U.S. population age 65 and older continue to increase, the number of Americans with Alzheimer's or other dementias will grow. This number will escalate rapidly in coming years, as the population of Americans age 65 and older is projected to nearly double from 48 million to 88 million by 2050.135 The baby boom generation has already begun to reach age 65 and beyond,\" 6 the age range of greatest risk of Alzheimer's; in fact, the first members of the baby boom generation turned 70 in 2016. This section reports on the number and proportion of people with Alzheimer's dementia to describe the magnitude of the burden of Alzheimer's on the community and health care system. The prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia refers to the proportion of people in a population who have Alzheimer's dementia at a given point in time. Incidence, the number of new cases per year, is also provided as an estimate of the risk of developing Alzheimer's or other dementias for different age groups. Estimates from selected studies on the number and proportion of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias vary depending on how each study was conducted. Data from several studies are used in this section. Prevalence of Alzheimer's and Other Dementias in the United States An estimated 5.5 million Americans of all ages are living with Alzheimer's dementia in 2017. This number includes an estimated 5.3 million people age 65 and older 42.3' and approximately 200,000 individuals under age 65 who have younger-onset Alzheimer's. though there is greater uncertainty about the younger-onset estimate.' 37 One in 10 people age 65 and older (10 percent) has Alzheimer's dementia. 8\"' The percentage of people with Alzheimer's dementia increases with age: 3 percent of people age 65-74, 17 percent of people age 75-84, and 32 percent of people age 85 and older have Alzheimer's dementia. 3I Of people who have Alzheimer's dementia, 82 percent are age 75 or older (Figure 1).84.\" 11=1 1. 1 Ages of People with Alzheimer's Dementia in the United States, 2017 Created from data from Hebert et al.' Percentages do not total 100 because of rounding The estimated number of people age 65 and older with Alzheimer's dementia comes from a study using the latest data from the 2010 U.S. Census and the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), a population-based study of chronic health conditions of older people.\" National estimates of the prevalence of all dementias are not available from CHAP, but they are available from other population-based studies including the Aging. Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), a nationally representative sample of older adults. A5.\"8-139 Based on estimates from ADAMS. 14 percent of people age 71 and older in the United States have dementia. 138 Prevalence studies such as CHAP and ADAMS are designed so that everyone in the study is tested for dementia. But outside of research settings, only about half of those who would meet the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's and other dementias are diagnosed with dementia by a physician. 14442 Furthermore. as discussed in 2015 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures. fewer than half of those who have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or another dementia in their Medicare records (or their caregiver, if the person was too impaired to respond to the survey) report being told gnosis.\"3.\"6 of the dia Because Alzheimer's dementia is underdiag nosed and underreported, a large portion of Americans with Alzheimer's may not know they have it.

The estimates of the number and proportion of people who have Alzheimer's in this section refer to people who have Alzheimer's dementia. But as described in the Overview section (see pages 4-16) and Special Report (see pages 61-68), revised diagnostic guidelines\" -23 propose that Alzheimer's disease begins many years before the onset of dementia. More research is needed to estimate how many people may have MCI due to Alzheimer's disease and how many people may be in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease. However, if Alzheimer's disease could be accurately detected before dementia develops, the number of people reported to have Alzheimer's disease would change to include more than just people who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia. Subjective Cognitive Decline The experience of worsening or more frequent confusion or memory loss (often referred to as subjective cognitive decline) is one of the earliest warning signs of Alzheimer's disease and may be a way to identify people who are at high risk of developing Alzheimer's or other dementias as well as MC1. 14215I Subjective cognitive decline does not refer to someone occasionally forgetting their keys or the name of someone they recently met; it refers to more serious issues such as having trouble remembering how to do things one has always done or forgetting things that one would normally know. Not all of those who experience subjective cognitive decline go on to develop MCI or dementia, but many do.\" 2-I\" According to a recent study, only those who over time consistently reported subjective cognitive decline that they found worrisome were at higher risk for developing Alzheimer's dementia.\"' Data from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, which included questions on self-perceived confusion and memory loss for people in 33 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, showed that 12 percent of Americans age 45 and older reported subjective cognitive decline, but 56 percent of those who reported it had not consulted a health care professional about it.'\" Individuals concerned about declines in memory and other cognitive abilities should consult a health care professional. Differences Between Women and Men in the Prevalence of Alzheimer's and Other Dementias More women than men have Alzheimer's or other dementias. Almost two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women.\".\" Of the 5.3 million people age 65 and older with Alzheimer's in the United States, 3.3 million are women and 2.0 million are men. 4631 Based on estimates from ADAMS, among people age 71 and older, 16 percent of women have Alzheimer's or other dementias compared with 11 percent of men.\" 8152 There are a number of potential biological and social reasons why more women than men have Alzheimer's or other dementias. 132 The prevailing view has been that this discrepancy is due to the fact that women live longer than men on average, and older age is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's.\" 3\"916\u00b0 Many studies of incidence (which indicates risk of developing disease) of Alzheimer's or any dementia\"' have found no significant difference between men and women in the proportion who develop Alzheimer's or other dementias at any given age. A recent study using data from the Framingham Heart Study suggests that because men in middle age have a higher rate of death from cardiovascular disease than women in middle age, men who survive beyond age 65 may have a healthier cardiovascular risk profile and thus an apparent lower risk for dementia than women of the same age.'\" Epidemiologists call this \"survival bias\" because the men who survive to older ages and are included in studies tend to be the healthiest men: as a result, they may have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's and other dementia than the men who died at an earlier age from cardiovascular disease. More research is needed to support this finding. However, researchers have recently begun to revisit the question of whether the risk of Alzheimer's could actually be higher for women at any given age due to biological or genetic variations or differences in life experiences.\"' A large study showed that the APOE-e4 genotype. the best known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's dementia, may have a stronger association with Alzheimer's dementia in women than ATTACHMENT- I OG 113 Prevalence 19 in men. 163464 It is unknown why this may be the case. but some evidence suggests that it may be due to an interaction between the APOE-e4 genotype and the sex hormone estrogen.' 65456 Finally, because low education is a risk factor for dementia.80-93.08.161 it is possible that lower educational attainment in women than in men born in the first half of the 20th century could account for a higher risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias in women.' 67 Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Prevalence of Alzheimer's and Other Dementias Although there are more non-Hispanic whites living with Alzheimer's and other dementias than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States, older African- Americans and Hispanics are more likely, on a per-capita basis, than older whites to have Alzheimer's or other dementias. 168-13 A review of many studies by an expert panel concluded that older African-Americans are about twice as likely to have Alzheimer's or other dementias as older whites, n4475 and Hispanics are about one and one-half times as likely to have Alzheimer's or other dementias as older whites.m.\" 5-1\" Currently, there is not enough evidence from population-based cohort studies in which everyone is tested for dementia to estimate the national prevalence of Alzheimer's and other dementias in other racial and ethnic groups. However, a study examining electronic medical records for members of a large health plan in California indicated that dementia incidence \u2014 determined by the presence of a dementia diagnosis in one's medical record \u2014 was highest in African-Americans, intermediate for Latinos (the term used in the study for those who self-reported as Latino or Hispanic) and whites, and lowest for Asian-Americans.' Variations in health, lifestyle and socioeconomic risk factors across racial groups likely account for most of the differences in risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias by race.'\" Despite some evidence that the influence of genetic risk factors on Alzheimer's and other dementias may differ by race,180-181 genetic factors do not appear to account for the large prevalence differences among racial groups? 9'82 Instead, health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which are associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's and other dementias, are believed to account for these differences as they are more prevalent in African-American and Hispanic people. 183184 Indeed, vascular dementia accounts for a larger proportion of dementia in African-Americans than in whites.' n Socioeconomic characteristics, including lower levels of education, higher rates of poverty, and greater exposure to early life adversity and discrimination. may also increase risk in African- American and Hispanic communities.' 83485 Some studies suggest that differences based on race and ethnicity do not persist in rigorous analyses that account for such factors. 18.1\"'\"9 There is evidence that missed diagnoses of Alzheimer's and other dementias are more common among older African-Americans and Hispanics than among older whites.' 86-187 Based on data for Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older. Alzheimer's or another dementia had been diagnosed in 6.9 percent of whites, 9.4 percent of African-Americans and 11.5 percent of Hispanics!\" Although rates of diagnosis were higher among African-Americans than among whites, according to prevalence studies that detect all people who have dementia irrespective of their use of the health care system, the rates should be higher (i.e., twice as high as 6.9 percent, which is approximately 13.8 percent).

Between 2012 and 2050, the oldest-old are expected to increase from 14 percent of all people age 65 and older in the United States to 22 percent of all people age 65 and older. 2\" This will result in an additional 12 million oldest-old people \u2014 individuals at the highest risk for developing Alzheimer's dementia. 2\" In 2017, about 2.1 million people who have Alzheimer's dementia are age 85 or older, accounting for 38 percent of all people with Alzheimer's dementia.\" When the first wave of baby boomers reaches age 85 (in 2031). it is projected that more than 3 million people age 85 and older will have Alzheimer's dementia.\" By 2050. as many as 7 million people age 85 and older may have Alzheimer's dementia, accounting for half (51 percent) of all people 65 and older with Alzheimer's dementia.\" ATTACHMENT-10G 119 Prevalence 25 ORTA I ITY AE MORBI D ITY 8 9 percent Increase in deaths due to Alzheimer's between 2000 and 2014. Deaths from Alzheimer's have nearly doubled during this period while those from heart disease \u2014 the leading cause of death \u2014 have declined. ATTACHMENT-10G Alzheimer's disease is officially listed as the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States.'\" It is the fifth-leading cause of death for those age 65 and older.'\" However, it may cause even more deaths than official sources recognize. Alzheimer's is also a leading cause of disability and poor health (morbidity). Before a person with Alzheimer's dies, he or she lives through years of morbidity as the disease progresses. Deaths from Alzheimer's Disease It is difficult to determine how many deaths are caused by Alzheimer's disease each year because of the way causes of death are recorded. According to data from the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 93.541 people died from Alzheimer's disease in 2014. 202 The CDC considers a person to have died from Alzheimer's if the death certificate lists Alzheimer's as the underlying cause of death, defined by the World Health Organization as \"the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death.\" 209 Severe dementia frequently causes complications such as immobility, swallowing disorders and malnutrition that significantly increase the risk of serious acute conditions that can cause death. One such condition is pneumonia, which is the most commonly identified cause of death among elderly people with Alzheimer's or other dernentias.210-211 Death certificates for individuals with Alzheimer's often list acute conditions such as pneumonia as the primary cause of death rather than Alzheimer's. 212\"2\" As a result, people with Alzheimer's disease who die due to these acute conditions may not be counted among the number of people who died from Alzheimer's disease according to the World Health Organization definition, even though Alzheimer's disease may well have caused the acute condition listed on the death certificate. This difficulty in using death certificates to accurately determine the number of deaths from Alzheimer's has been referred to as a \"blurred distinction between death with dementia and death from dementia.' 215 Another way to determine the number of deaths from Alzheimer's disease is through calculations that compare the estimated risk of death in those who have Alzheimer's with the estimated risk of death in those who do not have Alzheimer's. A study using data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study estimated that 500.000 deaths among people age 75 and older in the United States in 2010 could be attributed to Alzheimer's (estimates for people age 65 to 74 were not available), meaning that those deaths would not be expected to occur in that year if those individuals did not have Alzheimer's.'\" The true number of deaths caused by Alzheimer's is somewhere between the number of deaths from Alzheimer's recorded on death certificates and the number of people who have Alzheimer's disease when they die. According to 2014 Medicare claims data, about one-third of all Medicare beneficiaries who die in a given year have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's or another dementia.\"' Based on data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) study, in 2017 an estimated 700,000 people age 65 and older in the United States will have Alzheimer's when they die. 2\" Although some seniors who have Alzheimer's disease at the time of death die from causes that are unrelated to Alzheimer's, many of them die from Alzheimer's disease itself or from conditions in which Alzheimer's was a contributing cause, such as pneumonia. Irrespective of the cause of death, among people age 70. 61 percent of those with Alzheimer's are expected to die before age 80 compared with 30 percent of people without Alzheimer's. 210 Public Health Impact of Deaths from Alzheimer's Disease As the population of the United States ages. Alzheimer's is becoming a more common cause of death, and it is the only top 10 cause of death that cannot be prevented, cured or even slowed. Although deaths from other major causes have decreased significantly. official records indicate that deaths from Alzheimer's disease have increased significantly.

Duration of Illness from Diagnosis to Death Studies indicate that people age 65 and older survive an average of 4 to 8 years after a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia, yet some live as long as 20 years with Alzheimer's.161.221-228 This reflects the slow, insidious progression of Alzheimer's. Of the total number of years that they live with Alzehimer's dementia, individuals will spend an average of 40 percent of this time in dementia's most severe stage.\"' Much of the time will be spent in a nursing home. At age 80, approximately 75 percent of people living with Alzheimer's dementia are expected to be in a nursing home compared with only 4 percent of the general population at age 80. 2181n all, an estimated two-thirds of those who die of dementia do so in nursing homes. compared with 20 percent of people with cancer and 28 percent of people dying from all other conditions. 229 Burden of Alzheimer's Disease The long duration of illness before death contributes significantly to the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease because much of that time is spent in a state of disability and dependence. Scientists have developed methods to measure and compare the burden of different diseases on a population in a way that takes into account not only the number of people with the condition, but also both the number of years of life lost due to that disease as well as the number of healthy years of life lost by virtue of being in a state of disability. These measures indicate that Alzheimer's is a very burdensome disease and that the burden of Alzheimer's has increased more dramatically in the United States than other diseases in recent years. The primary measure of disease burden is called disability-adjusted ATTACHMENT-LOG 30 Alzheimer's Association, 2017 Alzheimer's Disease Dement 2017;13:325-373.

Caregiving often includes assistance with one or more activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing and dressing, as well as multiple instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), such as paying bills, shopping and transportation. 231'2\" Caregivers also provide emotional support to people with Alzheimer's. More than 15 million Americans provide unpaid care for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias.' In addition to providing descriptive information, this section compares caregivers of people with dementia to either caregivers of people with other medical conditions, or if that comparison is not available, to non-caregivers of similar ages and other characteristics. Unpaid Caregivers Eighty-three percent of the help provided to older adults in the United States comes from family members, friends or other unpaid caregivers. 2\" Nearly half of all caregivers (46 percent) who provide help to older adults do so for someone with Alzheimer's or another dementia. 2\" In 2016, caregivers of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias provided an estimated 18.2 billion hours of informal (that is, unpaid) assistance, a contribution to the nation valued at $230.1 billion. This is approximately 48 percent of the revenue of Walmart in 2016 ($482 billion) 2\" and nine times the total revenue of McDonald's in 2015 ($25.4 billion). 2\" The value of informal care (not including caregivers out-of-pocket costs) was nearly equal to the costs of direct medical and long-term care of dementia in 2010. 237 The three primary reasons caregivers provide care and assistance to a person with Alzheimer's are (1) the desire to keep a family member or friend at home (65 percent), (2) proximity to the person with dementia (48 percent) and (3) the caregiver's perceived obligation as a spouse or partner (38 percent).\" Individuals with dementia living in the community are more likely than older adults without dementia to rely on multiple unpaid caregivers; 30 percent of older adults with dementia rely on three or more caregivers, whereas 23 percent of older adults without dementia rely on three or more unpaid caregivers. 238 Only a small percentage of older adults with dementia do not receive help from family members or other informal care providers (8 percent). Of these individuals, more than 40 percent live alone, perhaps making it more difficult to ask for and receive informal care.'\" Who are the Caregivers?

Table 7 summarizes some of the most common types of dementia care provided. Though the care provided by family members of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias is somewhat similar to the help provided by caregivers of people with other conditions, dementia caregivers tend to provide more extensive assistance.

This number represents an average of 21.9 hours of care per caregiver per week, or 1,139 hours of care per caregiver per year' s With this care valued at $12.65 per hour, 419 the estimated economic value of care provided by family and other unpaid caregivers of people with dementia across the United States was 5230.1 billion in 2016. Table 8 (see pages 38-39) shows the total hours of unpaid care as well as the value of care provided by family and other unpaid caregivers for the United States and each state. Unpaid caregivers of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias provided care valued at more than 54 billion in each of 21 states. Unpaid caregivers in each of the four most populous states \u2014 California, Florida, New York and Texas \u2014 provided care valued at more than $14 billion. A longitudinal study of the monetary value of family caregiving for people with dementia found that the overall value of daily family care increased 18 percent with each additional year of providing care, and that the value of this care increased as the care recipient's cognitive abilities declined.'\" A study based on the same data source found that the estimated economic value of daily family caregiving costs were lower in situations in which caregivers felt closer in their relationship with the person with dementia.'\" Additional research is needed to estimate the future value of family care for people with Alzheimer's as the U.S. population continues to age. Caregivers of people with dementia report providing 27 hours more care per month on average (92 hours versus 65 hours) than caregivers of people without dementia, with 26 percent providing 41 or more hours of care per week. 239'245 Considering all sources of unpaid care (for example, help from multiple family members). individuals with dementia receive an average of 171 hours of care per month, which is over 100 hours more care per month than those without dementia (66 hours per month, on average).'\" Impact of Alzheimer's Caregiving Caring for a person with Alzheimer's or another dementia poses special challenges. For example. people in the middle to later stages of Alzheimer's experience losses in judgment, orientation, and the ability to understand and communicate effectively. Family caregivers must often help people with Alzheimer's manage these issues. The personality and behavior of a person with Alzheimer's are affected as well, and these changes are often among the most challenging for family caregivers.\" 5-2\" Individuals with Alzheimer's also require increasing levels of supervision and personal care as the disease progresses. As symptoms worsen, the care required of family members can result in increased emotional stress and depression; new or exacerbated health problems; and depleted income and finances due in part to disruptions in employment and paying for health care or other services for themselves and their care recipients.417,258-265 Data from the 2016 Alzheimer's Association Family Impact of Alzheimer's Survey reported in 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures indicated that among care contributors (a friend or relative who paid for dementia expenses and/or provided care for someone with dementia at least once a month in the prior year), 48 percent cut back on spending and 43 percent cut back on saving due to the out-of-pocket cost of providing help to someone with dementia.'\" Due to care responsibilities in the year prior to the survey, close to four in 10 care contributors indicated that the \"food they bought just didn't last, and they didn't have money to get more\" and three in 10 ate less because of care-related costs.\"' ATTACHMENT-10G 131 Caregiving 37 TABLES Number of Alzheimer's and Dementia (AID) Caregivers, Hours of Unpaid Care, Economic Value of Unpaid Care and Higher Health Care Costs of Caregivers by State, 2016* State AID Caregivers (in thousands) Hours of Unpaid Care (in millions) Value of Unpaid Care (in millions of dollars) Higher Health Care Costs of Caregivers (in millions of dollars)t Alabama 303 345 54,359 5188 Alaska 33 38 480 30 Arizona 325 370 4.685 176 Arkansas 176 200 2.531 108 California 1,600 1.822 23,043 999 Colorado 244 277 3,510 146 Connecticut 177 201 2.548 153 Delaware 53 61 770 45 District of Columbia 28 32 405 29 Florida 1.100 1.253 15.850 785 Georgia 519 591 7.478 283 Hawaii 66 75 944 45 Idaho 81 92 1,167 46 Illinois 588 670 8.470 397 Indiana 335 382 4,831 223 ' Iowa 135 154 1,945 93 Kansas 150 171 2.168 102 Kentucky 271 308 3.901 177 Louisiana 232 264 3.341 157 Maine 69 78 988 58 Maryland 291 332 4.196 218 Massachusetts 333 380 4,803 309 Michigan 511 582 7.361 337 Minnesota 251 286 3,614 186 Mississippi 206 234 2,964 134 Missouri 314 218 ATTACHMENT-1 8 (cont.)

Stress of Care Transitions Admitting a relative to a residential care facility has mixed effects on the emotional and psychological well-being of family caregivers. Some studies suggest that distress remains unchanged or even increases after a relative is admitted to a residential care facility, but other studies have found that distress declines following admission. 252.288-282 The demands of caregiving may intensify as people with dementia approach the end of life. 288 In the year before a care recipient's death, 59 percent of caregivers felt they were \"on duty\" 24 hours a day, and many felt that caregiving during this time was extremely stressful. 289 One study of end-of-life care found that 72 percent of family caregivers experienced relief when the person with Alzheimer's or another dementia died. 289 Caregiver Physical Health For some caregivers, the demands of caregiving may cause declines in their own health. Evidence suggests that the stress of providing dementia care increases caregivers' susceptibility to disease and health complications. 289 As shown in Figure 9. 38 percent of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers indicate that the physical stress of caregiving is high to very high. 412 Nearly three in 10 caregivers of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias report that providing care results in high physical strain (29 percent) compared with 17 percent of caregivers of people without dementia. 2\" Sleep disturbances, which can occur frequently when caring for a relative with Alzheimer's or another dementia, have also been shown to negatively influence family caregivers' health. 291-282 General Health Seventy-four percent of caregivers of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias reported that they were \"somewhat concerned\" to \"very concerned\" about maintaining their own health since becoming a caregiver.TM 7 Forty-two percent of caregivers of people with Alzheimer's or another dementia report that their health is excellent or very good, which is lower than caregivers of people without dementia (50 percent). 2\" Proportion of Alzheimer's and Dementia Caregivers Who Report High to Very High Emotional and Physical Stress Due to Caregiving Percentage 1.

Fifty-seven percent reported sometimes needing to go in late or leave early, and 16 percent had to take a leave of absence. Other work-related challenges for dementia and non- dementia caregivers who had been employed in the past year are summarized in Figure 10. 243 Interventions Designed to Assist Caregivers For more than 30 years, strategies to support family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's have been developed and evaluated. The types and focus of these strategies (often called \"interventions\") are summarized in Table 9 (see page 44). 26' In general. the goal of interventions is to improve the health and well-being of dementia caregivers by relieving the negative aspects of caregiving. Some also aim to delay nursing home admission of the person with dementia by providing caregivers with skills and resources (emotional. social and psychological) to continue helping their relatives or friends at home. Specific approaches used in various interventions include providing education to caregivers. helping caregivers manage dementia-related symptoms, improving social support for caregivers and providing caregivers with respite from caregiving duties. According to a recent publication on dementia caregiver interventions that reviewed seven meta-analyses and 17 systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials. the following characteristics distinguish interventions that are effective: family caregivers are actively involved in the intervention, in contrast to passively receiving information; the intervention is tailored and flexible to meet the changing needs of family caregivers during the course of a relative's dementia; and the intervention ATTACHMENT-1 OG 42 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figuietheimers Dement 2017:13:325-373. 60 50 40 30 20 Caregivers of People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias Who Had Been Employed at Any Time Since They Began Caregiving Percentage Caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias D Caregivers of other people I I I I Changes Went from full Gave up Received a warning Retired to part-time or cut back hours working entirely about performance/ attendance early Went in late.

Similar efforts have attempted to broaden the reach and accessibility of interventions for dementia caregivers through the use of technologies (for instance, video-phone delivery and online training) and have shown some success. 329-33I However, more work is needed to ensure that interventions for dementia caregivers are available and accessible to those who need them. Because caregivers and the settings in which they provide care are diverse, more studies are required to define which interventions are most effective for specific situations. 332-3\" Improved tools to \"personalize\" services for caregivers to maximize their benefits represent an emerging area of research.\" 5-33e More studies are also needed to explore the effectiveness of interventions in different racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups and in various geographic settings. 33335345 Paid Caregivers Direct Care Workers for People with Alzheimer's or Other Dementias Direct-care workers, such as nurse aides, home health aides and personal and home care aides, provide most of the paid long-term care to older adults living at home or in residential settings.\"' In nursing homes, nursing assistants make up the majority of staff who work with cognitively impaired residents. 347449 Nursing assistants help with bathing, ATTACHMENT-10G Caregiving 43 137 TABLE 9 Type and Focus of Caregiver Interventions Type of Intervention Description Case management - - - Provides assessment, information, planning, referral, care coordination and/or advocacy for family caregivers.

The care manager collaborates with primary care physicians and nurse practitioners to develop personalized care plans. These plans can provide support to family caregivers. help people with dementia manage care transitions (for example, a change in care provider or site of care), and ensure the person with dementia has access to appropriate community-based services. Other models include addressing the needs of family caregivers simultaneously with comprehensive disease management of the care recipient to improve the quality of life of both family caregivers and people with dementia in the community.\"\u00b0 Several evaluations have suggested that such approaches have considerable potential for improving outcomes for people with dementia and their family caregivers (for example, delayed nursing home admission and reduction in caregiver distress). 37'-37e Current research is attempting to determine the feasibility of these models beyond the specialty settings in which they currently operate. 376-3\" In 2016, the National Academies of Sciences. Engineering. and Medicine released Families Caring for an Aging America, a seminal report that includes a number of recommendations to refocus national health care reform efforts from models of care that center on the patient (person-centered care) to models of care that also explicitly engage and support the patient's family (person- and family-centered care).\"\" These service models recognize the important role family members play in providing care and incorporate family caregivers during the delivery of health care to relatives with dementia.

In a population-based study of adults ages 70 to 89 in Olmsted County, Minnesota, annual health care costs were significantly higher for individuals with newly diagnosed dementia and existing dementia than for those with normal cognition, and significantly higher for individuals with existing dementia than those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 388 Annual health care costs for individuals with MCI were not significantly different, however, from costs for individuals with normal cognition. Several groups of researchers have found that health care and prescription drug spending is significantly higher in the year prior to diagnosis 3A9-391 and two years prior to diagnosis\"' compared with otherwise similar individuals not diagnosed with Alzheimer's or another dementia, although there is less agreement about the sources of increased spending.

Additionally, individuals diagnosed with cognitive impairment by a specialist had lower Medicare costs in the year after receiving a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia than those diagnosed by a non-specialist. 393 While more research is needed to understand the underlying causes of increased use of health care services immediately prior to and after receiving a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia, it may be attributed to care for disability and injuries, such as falls, that might result from the early stage of the disease, 394 treatments related to cognitive impairment or coexisting medical conditions; the timing of receiving an Alzheimer's diagnosis; and costs of diagnostic procedures.

Many people with dementia also receive paid services at home; in adult day centers, assisted living facilities or nursing homes; or in more than one of these settings at different times during the often long course of the disease. The average costs of these services are high (assisted living: 543.539 per year 395 and nursing home care: 582.125 to 592,378 per year), 396 and Medicaid is the only public program that covers the long nursing home stays that most people with dementia require in the late stages of their illnesses. Use of Long-Term Care Services by Setting Most people with Alzheimer's or other dementias who live at home receive unpaid help from family members and friends, but some also receive paid home- and community-based services, such as personal care and adult day care. A study of older people who needed help to perform daily activities \u2014 such as dressing. bathing, shopping and managing money \u2014 found that those who also had cognitive impairment were more than twice as likely as those who did not have cognitive impairment to receive paid home care. 396 In addition, those who had cognitive impairment and received paid services used almost twice as many hours of care monthly as those who did not have cognitive impairment. 396 People with Alzheimer's or other dementias make up a large proportion of all elderly people who receive adult day services and nursing home care.

Sixty-one percent of nursing home residents in 2014 had moderate or severe cognitive impairment.'\" Nursing home admission by age 80 is expected for 75 percent of people with Alzheimer's dementia compared with only 4 percent of the general population.\"' Alzheimer's special care units. An Alzheimer's special care unit is a dedicated unit in a nursing home that has tailored services for individuals with Alzheimer's or other dementias. Nursing homes had a total of 73.742 beds in Alzheimer's special care units in 2014, a decrease of 3 percent from the previous year.403-40' These Alzheimer's special care unit beds accounted for just 4 percent of all nursing home beds. despite 61 percent of nursing home residents having moderate or severe cognitive impairment. Long-Term Care Services Provided at Home and in the Community Nationally. state Medicaid programs are shifting long-term care services from institutional care to home- and community-based services as a means to both reduce unnecessary costs and meet the growing demand for these services by older adults. The federal and state governments share the management and funding of the program, and states differ greatly in the services covered by their Medicaid programs. Spending on home care for Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's or other dementias nearly doubled between 2004 and 2011, although increases in spending may be due to a variety of factors, including more people being diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia, more people using home care, more intensive use of home care service and an increase in Medicaid coverage by older adults. 380.40' In 2014. home- and community-based services represented the majority (53 percent) of Medicaid spending on long-term services and supports, with the remaining 47 percent for institutional care.'\" More research is needed, however, to understand the extent to which home- and community-based services meet the needs of individuals with Alzheimer's or other dementias. Transitions Between Care Settings A recent research study demonstrated that individuals with dementia often move between a nursing facility, hospital and home, rather than remaining solely in a nursing facility. 40' In this longitudinal study of primary care patients with dementia, researchers found that those discharged from a nursing facility were nearly equally as likely to be discharged home (39 percent) as discharged to a hospital (44 percent). Individuals with dementia may also transition between a nursing facility and hospital or between a nursing facility, home and hospital, creating challenges for caregivers and providers to ensure that care is coordinated across settings. Other research has shown that nursing home residents frequently have burdensome transitions at the end of life, including admission to an intensive care unit in the last month of life, late enrollment in hospice and receipt of a feeding tube.\"'\" The number of care transitions for nursing home residents with advanced cognitive impairment varies substantially across geographic regions of the United States. 409 ATTACHMENT- I OG 147 Use and Costs of Health Care.

The median cost for care in an assisted living facility is $3.628 per month, or $43.539 per year.'\u00b0 5 The cost of assisted living has increased 2.2 percent annually over the past 5 years. Nursing homes. The average cost for a private room in a nursing home is $253 per day, or $92,378 per year. The average cost of a semi- private room in a nursing home is $225 per day, or $82,125 per year.\"' The cost of nursing home care has increased by 3.5 percent and 3.1 percent annually over the past 5 years for a private and semi-private room, respectively. Affordability of Long-Term Care Services Few individuals with Alzheimer's or other dementias have sufficient long-term care insurance or can afford to pay out of pocket for long-term care services for as long as the services are needed. Income and asset data are not available for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias specifically, but 50 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have incomes of $24,150 or less and 25 percent have incomes of $14.350 or less (in 2014 dollars).' Fifty percent of Medicare beneficiaries had total savings of $63.350 or less On 2014 dollars), 25 percent have savings of $11,900 or less, and 8 percent had no savings or were in debt. Median savings were substantially lower for African-American and Hispanic beneficiaries than for white Medicare beneficiaries.\"' Long-Term Care Insurance Long-term care insurance covers costs of long- term care services and supports in the home, in the community and in residential facilities. Long-term care insurance typically covers care provided in a nursing home, assisted living facility. and Alzheimer's special care facility, as well as community-based services such as adult day care and services provided in the home, including nursing care and help with personal care!\" The 2016 Alzheimer's Association Family Impact of Alzheimer's Survey reported in 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures found that among the more than 3.500 respondents, 28 percent believed that Medicare covered the cost of nursing home care for people with Alzheimer's and 37 percent did not know whether it covered the cost of nursing home care. 265While Medicare covers care in a long-term care hospital. skilled nursing care in a skilled nursing facility and hospice care, it does not cover long-term care in a nursing home. 4\" Industry reports estimate that approximately 7.3 to 7.5 million Americans have long-term care insurance. 414-415 Enrollment in private long-term care insurance is more common for older adults with higher-than-average incomes. While only 8.8 percent of adults age 55 and older had long-term care insurance in 2008. 19 percent of those with incomes greater than $100.000 had coverage. 4\" Private health and long-term care insurance policies funded only about 8 percent of total long-term care spending in 2013, representing $24.8 billion of the $310 billion total in 2013 dollars.\"' The private long- term care insurance market has consolidated since 2010.

Most nursing home residents who qualify for Medicaid must spend all of their Social Security income and any other monthly income, except for a very small personal needs allowance, to pay for nursing home care. Medicaid only makes up the difference if the nursing home resident cannot pay the full cost of care or has a financially dependent spouse. There is a general lack of knowledge about Medicaid coverage and long-term care. In a survey about the financial impact of Alzheimer's and other dementias on families. 36 percent of respondents mistakenly believed that Medicaid was long-term care insurance. 2\" While Medicaid covers the cost of nursing home care, its coverage of many long-term care and support services, such as assisted living care, home-based skilled nursing care and help with personal care, varies by state. Total Medicaid spending for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias is projected to be $44 billion in 2017 (in 2017 dollars).\" 1 Estimated state-by-state Medicaid spending on people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2017 (in 2017 dollars) is included in Table 14 (see page 55). Total per-person Medicaid payments for Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older with Alzheimer's or other dementias were 23 times as great as Medicaid payments for other Medicare beneficiaries.\"' Much of the difference in payments for beneficiaries with Alzheimer's or other dementias and other beneficiaries is due to the costs associated with long-term care (nursing homes and other residential care facilities, such as assisted living facilities) and the greater percentage of people with dementia who are eligible for Medicaid. Use and Costs of Care at the End of Life Hospice care provides medical care, pain management and emotional and spiritual support for people who are dying. including people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. Hospice care also provides emotional and spiritual support and bereavement services for families of people who are dying. The main purpose of hospice is to allow individuals to die with dignity and without pain and other distressing symptoms that often accompany terminal illness. Individuals can receive hospice care in their homes, assisted living residences or nursing homes. Medicare is the primary source of payment for hospice care, but private insurance, Medicaid and other sources also pay for hospice care. In 2014,20 percent of Medicare beneficiaries admitted to hospice had a primary diagnosis of dementia. including Alzheimer's dementia (Table 15)\" 9. compared with 17 percent in 2009. 420 Dementia was the second most common primary diagnosis for Medicare beneficiaries admitted to hospice overall, with cancer being the most common primary diagnosis. For all Medicare beneficiaries admitted to hospice, the average length of stay was 69 days in 2014, with 27 percent having a stay of seven or fewer days in hospice. While average length of stay for hospice beneficiaries by primary diagnosis was not publicly reported for 2014, the average length of stay was 106 days for hospice beneficiaries with a primary diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia and 92 days for hospice beneficiaries with non-Alzheimer's dementia in 2009. 42\" The average per-person hospice payment for Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's dementia was $1.966 compared with 5149 for all other Medicare beneficiaries.'\" For Medicare beneficiaries with advanced dementia who receive skilled nursing facility care in the last 90 days of life, those who are enrolled in hospice are less likely to die in the hospital. 42' Additionally those enrolled in hospice care are less likely to be hospitalized in the last 30 days of life 422 and more likely to receive regular treatment for pain.423-424 Nearly half of individuals with dementia die in hospice care.\"' Additionally. 19 percent of individuals with dementia receive hospice care in a given year, a higher percentage than for other chronic conditions.'\" Satisfaction with patient care is higher for families of individuals with dementia who are enrolled in hospice care than for those not enrolled in hospice care. 4\" Feeding Tube Use and Care Transitions at the End of Life Individuals with frequent transitions between health care settings are more likely to have feeding tubes at the end of life, even though feeding tube placement has little or no benefit.'\" The odds of having a ATTACHMENT-10G 56 Alzheimer's Association. 2017 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figienheimers Dement 2017;13:325-373.

Researchers found that feeding tube use was highest for people with dementia whose care was managed by a subspecialist physician or both a subspecialist and a general practitioner. By contrast, feeding tube use was lower among people with dementia whose care was managed by a general practitioner: In-\" With the expansion of Medicare-supported hospice care, the use of feeding tubes in the last 90 days of life has decreased for individuals with Alzheimer's or other dementias.\" Finally, with the increased focus on the lack of evidence supporting feeding tube use for people with advanced dementia, the proportion of nursing home residents receiving a feeding tube in the prior 12 months has decreased from nearly 12 percent in 2000 to less than 6 percent in 2014. 42\" Studies have demonstrated a decrease in the proportion of individuals with Alzheimer's dementia who die in an acute care hospital, with end-of-life care shifting to home and nursing homes. 425 Additionally. more than twice as many individuals with the disease were receiving hospice care at the time of death in 2009 than in 2000 (48 percent in 2009 versus 20 percent in 2000). Similarly, expansion of hospice care is also associated with fewer individuals with dementia having more than two hospitalizations for any reason or more than one hospitalization for pneumonia. urinary tract infection, dehydration or sepsis in the last 90 days of life. 429 Use and Costs of Health and Long-Term Care Services by Race/Ethnicity Among Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's or other dementias, African-Americans had the highest Medicare payments per person. while whites had the lowest spending ($26,686 versus $19,734) (Table 16). The largest difference in spending is for hospital care. for which African-Americans spend 1.7 times more than whites ($8,690 versus 55,163). 188 In a study of Medicaid beneficiaries with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia that included both Medicaid and Medicare claims data, researchers found significant differences in the costs of care by race/ethnicity.' These results demonstrated that African-Americans had significantly higher costs of care than whites or Hispanics, primarily due to more inpatient care and more comorbidities. These differences may be attributable to later-stage diagnosis, which may lead to higher levels of disability while receiving care: delays in accessing timely primary care; lack of care coordination: and duplication of services across providers. However, more research is needed to understand the reasons for this health care disparity.

Preventable hospitalizations are hospitalizations for conditions that could have been avoided with better access to or quality of preventive and primary care. Based on data from the 2006 to 2008 Health and Retirement Study and from Medicare. preventable hospitalizations represented 25 percent of the total hospitalizations for individuals with Alzheimer's or other dementias. \u00b031 The proportion was substantially higher, however. for African-Americans. Hispanics and individuals with low incomes. Hispanic older adults had the highest proportion of preventable hospitalizations (34 percent). Based on data from the 1998 to 2008 Health and Retirement Study and from Medicare. after controlling for demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics and health risk factors, individuals with dementia had a 1.3 times greater risk and individuals with depression and dementia had a 1.7 times greater risk of having a preventable hospitalization than those without dementia, cognitive impairment without dementia or depression.\" 2 Healthy People 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' initiative to achieve 10-year goals for health promotion and disease prevention, has set a target to reduce preventable hospitalizations for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias by 10 percent by 2020. 4\" Medicare beneficiaries who have Alzheimer's or other dementias and a serious coexisting medical condition (for example, congestive heart failure) are more likely to be hospitalized than people with the same coexisting medical condition but without dementia (Figure 13). 284 One research team found that individuals hospitalized with heart failure are more likely to be readmitted or die after hospital discharge if they also have cognitive impairrnent. 4\" Another research team found that Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's or other dementias have more potentially ATTACHMENT- I OG Use and Costs of Health Care, Long-Term Care and Hospice 59 153 avoidable hospitalizations for diabetes complications and hypertension. meaning that the hospitalizations could possibly be prevented through proactive care management in the outpatient setting.'\" Differences in health care use between individuals with and without dementia are most prominent for those residing in the community. Based on data from the Health and Retirement Study, community-residing individuals with dementia were more likely to have a potentially preventable hospitalization, an emergency department visit that was potentially avoidable, and/or an emergency department visit that resulted in a hospitalization.\"' For individuals residing in a nursing home, there were no differences in the likelihood of being hospitalized or having an emergency department visit. Initiatives to Reduce Avoidable Health Care and Nursing Home Use Recent research has demonstrated that two types of programs have potential for reducing avoidable health care and nursing home use, with one type of program focusing on the caregiver and the other focusing on the care delivery team. The Caregiving section (see pages 32-45) describes caregiver support programs that have promise for reducing unnecessary emergency department visits and hospitalizations and reducing transitions to residential care for individuals with Alzheimer's or other dementias. Additionally, collaborative care models \u2014 models that include not only geriatricians. but also social workers, nurses and medical assistants \u2014 can improve care coordination, thereby reducing health care costs associated with hospitalizations, emergency department visits and other outpatient visits.\"' For example, an interprofessional memory care clinic was shown to reduce per-person health care costs by $3,474 in 2012 dollars (53.871 in 2016 dollars) over a year for individuals with memory problems compared with others whose care was overseen by a primary care provider only.\"' More than half of the cost savings was attributed to lower inpatient hospital costs. The program was relatively low cost per person. with an average annual cost of 6618 (5689 in 2016 dollars) \u2014 a nearly 6-to-1 return on investment. Another group of researchers found that individuals with dementia whose care was concentrated within a smaller number of clinicians had fewer hospitalizations and emergency department visits and lower health care spending overall, compared with individuals whose care was more dispersed across a larger number of clinicians. 436 More research is needed to understand whether continuity of care is a strategy for decreasing unnecessary health care use for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. Projections for the Future Total annual payments for health care, long-term care and hospice care for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias are projected to increase from $259 billion in 2017 to more than $1.1 trillion in 2050 (in 2017 dollars). This dramatic rise includes more than four-fold increases both in government spending under Medicare and Medicaid and in out-of-pocket spending. A21 ATTACHMENT-JOG 60 2017:13:325-373. Jason Karlawish Ctwassmasas401saltirwrOaftwei tawaslislatta Clifford R. Dement 2017;13:374-380. 155 In the history of medicine, one means to progress is when we make the decision that our assumptions and definitions of disease are no longer consistent with the scientific evidence, and no longer serve our health care needs. The arc of scientific progress is now requiring a change in how we diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Both the National Institute on Aging \u2014 Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) 2011 workgroup and the International Work Group (IWG) have proposed guidelines that use detectable measures of biological changes in the brain, commonly known as biological markers, or biomarkers, as part of the diagnosis. This Special Report examines how the development and validation of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers \u2014 including those detectable in the blood or cerebral spinal fluid, or through neuroimaging \u2014 is a top research priority, and how this has the potential to markedly change how we diagnose Alzheimer's disease and, as a result, how we count the number of people with this disease. As research advances a biomarker-based method for diagnosis and treatment at the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, we envision a future in which Alzheimer's disease is placed in the same category as other chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, which can be readily identified with biomarkers and treated before irrevocable disability occurs. Introduction After Dr. Alois Alzheimer's 1906 case report of the disease that came to bear his name, for much of the 20th century, Alzheimer's disease was defined as an unusual cause of dementia in adults we now consider middle-aged.' \"Senile dementia\" was the diagnosis for the more common cause of dementia in individuals 65 and older. In 1976. Robert Katzman, M.D., made the case that these definitions should change. Arguing that an age-based distinction between dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia was neither scientifically nor medically sensible, 2 he used scientific data to conclude that the two conditions were in fact one and to call them both Alzheimer's disease. \"Although further studies are clearly indicated, the fact remains that neither the clinician, the neuropathologist nor the electron microscopist can distinguish between the two disorders (Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia) except by the age of the patient.\" 2 His rationale was pragmatic \u2014 dementia at any age causes substantial personal, medical and economic burden. Dr Katzman's contribution that Alzheimer's disease was a cause of dementia across a wide age span was incorporated into diagnostic criteria published in 1984. known as the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (now known as the Alzheimer's Association) Criteria. or NINCDS-ADRDA Criteria.' These criteria did not include biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Since Dr Katzman's time, Alzheimer's science has made notable discoveries. Using certain biomarkers, we can now distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia. In this sense, the arc of scientific progress is now requiring another change in how we diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Both the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) 2011 workgroup's and the International Work Group (IWG) 7-9 have proposed guidelines that use biomarkers as part of the diagnosis. The guidelines use biomarkers ATTACHMENT-IOU 62 Kariawish Jet al. Specilltpet 2017. Alzheimers Dement 2017;13:374-380. (such as brain imaging of amyloid plagues, changes in brain volume, and measures of tau and a myloid in spinal fluid) and clinical symptoms to define dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease, and also preclinical Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's.'\" The science of Alzheimer's is the primary driver of this change. Drug interventions in people with Alzheimer's disease dementia have repeatedly reported negative results. Research shows points in the course of the disease when an intervention might effectively slow or even stop the disease. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN) study findings have shown brain changes starting 10 to 20 years before the onset of dementia symptoms in people genetically destined to get Alzheimer's disease.\" Ongoing trials in this population are testing interventions at this pre- symptomatic point in an effort to delay or even prevent the onset of dementia symptoms. Other clinical trials (A4 Study, etc.) are testing interventions in people who do not have memory (cognitive) and thinking (functional) changes or these genes but do have measurable Alzheimer's biomarkers.\" The development and validation of biomarkers \u2014 including those detectable in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid, or through neuroimaging \u2014 may significantly change how we identify Alzheimer's disease and, as a result, how we estimate the number of people with this disease. This is important because Alzheimer's disease prevalence and incidence estimates are used to calculate other statistics, which are used to describe the scope of the Alzheimer's problem in the U.S., illustrate the need to combat the disease, and identify and allocate the resources needed to address it. Rethinking Our Assumptions About Alzheimer's Disease The U.S. has, since 2011. charted a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease. The first of the plan's five goals is to effectively treat and prevent the disease by 2025. 22 Researchers and those who translate research into clinical practice have reached a consensus: a core strategy to achieve this goal relies on studies testing What are Biomarkers? A biomarker, or biological marker, is a measurable indicator of some biological state or condition in the human body. Clinicians use biomarkers to diagnose the presence or absence of disease, assess the risk of developing a disease, or understand how a patient has responded to a treatment. For example, a high blood glucose level (blood sugar) may be diagnostic of diabetes and lowering that level can indicate the success of a prescribed diet or medication. Researchers are investigating several promising biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. These include, but are not limited to, the amount of accumulation of the proteins beta-amyloid and tau in the brain. These proteins can be measured using brain imaging or the levels in cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Another kind of biomarker is changes in brain size and activity. Identifying and then validating biomarkers for Alzheimer's is critical. They will facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. Many researchers believe that early intervention \u2014 either at the mild . cognitive impairment (MCI) stage or even before symptoms appear \u2014 offers the best chance of slowing or stopping the progression of Alzheimer's disease and therefore the best chance of preserving brain function. Biomarkers also have an important role in the discovery of treatments. They enable researchers . to identify which individuals to enroll in clinical trials to test new therapies. Biomarkers allow researchers to enroll those individuals with the brain changes that treatments target. (It's important to note that the most effective biomarker test or combination of tests may differ depending on the stage of the disease and other factors.) Biomarkers also allow researchers to monitor the effects of these treatments. The more a change in a biomarker maps onto the health of the patient, the better that biomarker is to assess whether a treatment is effective. Research on new strategies for earlier' diagnosis. including . . ongoing efforts areas in Alzheimer's science. ATTACHMENT- I OG 157 Special Report \u2014 Alzheimer's Disease: The Next Frontier 63 drugs in persons who have biomarker confirmation of the presence of Alzheimer's disease.\" Studies such as the A4 Study discussed above, as well as trials in persons with Alzheimer's disease dementia, are enrolling persons who have these biomarkers.\".\" This strategy aligns with approaches taken with other common diseases of aging, such as cardiovascular disease. Clinicians use measures of biological change. such as elevated levels of blood pressure or cholesterol, to diagnose and treat individuals. Their goal is to prevent the person from suffering another heart attack or worsening heart failure, or to prevent these problems from happening in the first place. Someday. clinicians may have a similar strategy to diagnose and treat Alzheimer's disease. They may use biological measures (biomarker-based) to diagnose and then prescribe treatments to these persons, treatments that trials have shown to either slow cognitive and functional decline or even prevent the onset of symptoms of dementia. Alzheimer's related brain changes \u2014 amyloid plaques and tau tangles among others \u2014 contribute to the cognitive impairment observed in dementia due to Alzheimer's. 25-29 A clinically effective intervention that targets these brain changes will help to validate the disease as a continuum that begins before cognitive decline. This confirmation will change how we identify (and therefore estimate) individuals with Alzheimer's disease. It will alter the prevalence and incidence of the disease. just as the treatment of vascular disease has altered the prevalence of dementia among individuals with primarily vascular lesions. 3\" As these events unfold. they compel us to plan for a future when Alzheimer's disease is defined using biomarkers alone, not symptoms. (See pages 67-68, \"Determining the Incidence and Prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease.\") The Evolving Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Current methods of diagnosis do not conform to what we know about the disease. The 1984 NINCDS- ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer's disease defined it as a clinical disease caused by underlying brain changes.' The assumption was that an individual with an amnestic dementia would have Alzheimer's- related brain changes, namely amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, if the individual came to autopsy. Conversely, individuals without amnestic dementia would not have plaques or tangles at autopsy. This definition of Alzheimer's intertwines the signs and symptoms of dementia and the underlying brain changes.' In the years that followed the adoption of those criteria, studies suggested that the clinical symptoms and underlying brain changes do not always align. Autopsy studies found that 10-30 percent of individuals who met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer's disease did not have significant Alzheimer's-related brain changes (i.e.. plaques and/or tangles). Instead, they had other (non-Alzheimer's) brain changes at autopsy.\" Often Alzheimer's was mixed with non-Alzheimer's brain changes, such as cerebral infarctions or Lewy body disease, particularly in older individuals. 26.27.\" Furthermore, autopsy studies in individuals who were cognitively normal for their age found that roughly 30 percent had Alzheimer's-related brain changes at death. 34'3\u00b0 Over the past roughly two decades, biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease-related brain changes continued to be developed. They fit into two classes: (1) brain imaging of amyloid and tau buildup. and of brain volume and brain metabolism changes. and (2) measures of relevant proteins in spinal fluid.'\u00b0 19 These biomarkers illustrate or represent the presence of amyloid plaques. tau tangles and brain cell death or injury.\" Studies have validated that biomarkers are indeed reliable measures of the relevant disease-related changes in the living brain. 38-44 These studies, like autopsy studies, also demonstrated that roughly one-third of individuals who meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer's disease do not have the required brain changes (and thus do not have Alzheimer's disease), -6 In addition, studies showed that roughly one-third of clinically normal older individuals do have Alzheimer's-related brain changes without the clinical symptoms. 43-45.47.48 ATTACHMENT- 10G 64 Kar1awish Jet Alzheimers Recognizing the potential for biomarkers. both the NIA- AA and the IWG have proposed that, when used alongside clinical criteria, biomarkers can increase the confidence that a diagnosis of dementia is or is not due to Alzheimer's disease. 4449 Importantly, the NIA-AA also proposed that biomarkers could identify MCI as due either to Alzheimer's (called MCI due to Alzheimer's disease) or to other diseases.' The equivalent term for biomarker-positive individuals with MCI is prodromal Alzheimer's disease in the IWG criteria. Further, the NIA-AA proposed that cognitively normal individuals with abnormal Alzheimer's biomarkers have preclinical Alzheimer's disease. If this is validated, then individuals who have no cognitive impairment but have Alzheimer's biomarkers have Alzheimer's disease. \u00b0 A biomarker-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease \u2014 one based on brain changes, not cognitive or functional changes \u2014 will change the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's. The Prevalence and Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease in a New Era of Research Today. we understand that Alzheimer's disease exists as a continuum beginning with a phase that may only be detectable through biomarkers, moving through the dementia stage. In the future, a biomarker- based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease will impact the estimates of incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's. It will add a population of individuals who are currently not included in estimates (people with Alzheimer's biomarkers but no dementia) and remove a population that currently is included (people with dementia but no Alzheimer's biomarkers). The Alzheimer's Association 2017 Akheimer's Disease Facts and Figures reports the prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's in the U.S. Among individuals age 65 and older, the prevalence in 2017 is estimated to be 5.3 million (one in 10 people age 65 and older or 10 percent have Alzheimer's dementia). and 480.000 people age 65 or older will develop Alzheimer's dementia in the U.S. in 2017 (further information can be found on pages 18-25). Epidemiologists, demographers and biostatisticians will use these prevalence and incidence estimates to calculate other statistics, such as the numbers of people providing care and support for someone with the disease, the costs of care, and mortality. Clinicians, policy makers and organizations use these statistics to describe the size of the Alzheimer's problem in the U.S., to demonstrate the need to combat the disease, and to identify the resources needed to address it. Validated Alzheimer's disease biomarkers will transform how study results are interpreted and change the messages and terms professionals and society use to talk about who has Alzheimer's disease and how big of a problem the disease poses. To accurately answer the question, \"What is the true prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease?\" we have to identify Alzheimer's disease in a way that is grounded in current science and makes sense to individuals, families, clinicians, researchers and health care policyrnakers. Looking ahead, a biologically- based Alzheimer's disease diagnosis will yield different prevalence and incidence figures than a diagnosis that uses only the severity of cognitive or functional impairment (either using DSM or NINCDS-ADRDA criteria). It will exclude individuals who have dementia but do not have the Alzheimer's biomarkers and thus do not have Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, it will include individuals with MCI who have Alzheimer's biomarkers and therefore have Alzheimer's disease, a proportion that may, according to existing studies, be as high as 56 percent of persons with a diagnosis of MCI.\".\" Even further in the future and with more research. it will also include people who do not have cognitive impairment but have Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. Epidemiologic and related natural history studies that measure cognition in older adults and that want to estimate the prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease will need to gather biomarker data from their participants. We should expect that these study results will further disrupt our understanding of the causes and trajectories of cognitive impairment. Studies that do not use these measures will not be able to accurately ATTACHMENT-10G 159 Special Report \u2014 Alzheimer's Disease; The Next Frontier 65 report the prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease. (They can report on the clinical severity of cognitive impairment in a population using constructs such as dementia or mild cognitive impairment.) It is possible that these biomarker measures will add to the burdens and risks encountered by research participants. This, in turn. may hinder study recruitment, retention and accessibility. Studies to assess why individuals might refuse to undergo biomarker measures, test interventions to change that decision, and discover messaging that motivates the intention to undergo biomarker testing will be essential to address this problem. Studies will likely benefit from collaborations among epidemiologists, bioethicists, clinicians, biomarker scientists and decision-scientists who interpret data and help make public health recommendations. Conclusion Even with scientific progress, a common question from the public has been, \"What's the difference between Alzheimer's disease and dementia?\" The NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria of 1984 aimed to help answer that question. 3Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent cause of the dementia syndrome. As dementia science has progressed, biomarker-based data have advanced our understanding of who has Alzheimer's disease as well as contributed to a more accurate clinical diagnosis of who has dementia due to Alzheimer's, Biomarker-based clinical criteria and future clinical trial data will continue to change our understanding of who has Alzheimer's disease, as improved diagnostic techniques will provide earlier identification of cognitive impairment, and of the brain changes that lead to it. As with cardiovascular disease, we must care not just about those who have had a disease manifesting event, such as a heart attack, but everyone who has cardiovascular disease-related biological changes that precede the heart attack. All of these individuals represent the societal burden of cardiovascular disease. Similarly, although we have known for years about the occurrence of dementia due to Alzheimer's, as a result of the recent use of biomarkers in studies, we have learned that a proportion of people previously thought to have cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimer's disease lack those biomarkers. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease will come to include the full spectrum of persons with Alzheimer's biomarkers, those who are symptomatic \u2014 with either dementia or MCI \u2014 and those who are still asymptomatic but have preclinical Alzheimer's disease. All individuals with biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. including those with and without dementia symptoms, will represent the full disease burden. Additional research and development of guidelines for the future use of biomarkers is urgently needed to optimize therapeutic strategies for this potentially much larger population of people with Alzheimer's disease. Successful validation of biomarkers will bring our definition of Alzheimer's disease in line with the remarkable advances we have seen in Alzheimer's research over the past decade. This latest research is now allowing us to envision a future in which Alzheimer's is no longer a disease leading to irrevocable cognitive and functional decline and death, but rather a chronic condition like cardiovascular disease, AIDS or some cancers that can often be managed with early intervention. ATTACHMENT-10G 66 Karlawish Jet al. Alzheimer's 2017. 2017:13:374-380. Determining the Incidence and Prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease Counting the incidence or prevalence of Alzheimer's disease or dementia due to Alzheimer's is complex. In the absence of registries akin to cancer registries or routine disease monitoring systems used to track infectious diseases, investigators must make a series of assumptions. These assumptions mean we are not so much counting as we are estimating the prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease. Below, we review these assumptions, and why studies have arrived at different estimates. The process begins with identifying a study population, usually a cohort of individuals in a given region. It could also be a representative sample in various regions. Next, investigators select a strategy to identify the cases of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in that given population. Some studies have used a two-phase strategy that starts with a brief cognitive test administered to the total group of participants to identify potential cases (known as the screening phase of the survey), who are then more fully evaluated using the Alzheimer's disease diagnostic criteria. 52-55 Other studies fully evaluate a random sub-group from the total participants: still others fully evaluate the entire participating group. A crucial methodological step to identify the individuals with Alzheimer's disease is the choice of diagnostic criteria that will be used in the study. Historically, studies have used a clinical diagnosis of the disease \u2014 that is. they counted people who had signs and symptoms of dementia. They have not included biomarkers as part of the criteria for the disease, nor have they excluded people with signs and symptoms of dementia but no biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. In most cases, the onset of dementia or dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease is gradual. It is therefore difficult in the early stages of the disease to assign a diagnosis of dementia. Consequently, investigators using brief cognitive tests face the error of mistakenly diagnosing someone as cognitively normal, and therefore without the disease, when in fact, the person is not normal; in other words, the error of false negatives, which can lead to an underestimate of prevalence and incidence. More recent studies, therefore, have abandoned brief screening tests. Instead, they either fully examine all participants in the sample or they fully examine a random sample of the study population. 54-56 Each of the design choices described above creates variability in who is selected for evaluation and, hence, as studies differ in these choices, there is variability in their respective prevalence estimates. The Alzheimer's Association uses estimates for the prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease modeled by the Chicago Health and Aging Project at Rush University Medical Center, called CHAP. 57.58 CHAP is a longitudinal, population-based study in a geographically defined area of Chicago with significant population diversity. It began in 1993 with a census of individuals age 65 or older using in-home interview and random sampling of participants for clinical evaluation for dementia due to Alzheimer's? CHAP researchers identify an individual living with Alzheimer's disease by detecting cognitive decline that then triggers a clinical assessment. The clinician uses the 1984 NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to determine if the dementia is caused ATTACH MENTr I OG Special Report \u2014 Alzheimer's DiseaselThe Next Frontier 67 . , 161 by Alzheimer's disease.' These criteria focus on dementia assessed by an interview with the participant and an informant, usually their partner or child (if available), and cognitive testing.' CHAP uses newly diagnosed cases of Alzheimer's \u2014 incidence \u2014 to determine the prevalence. This is a notable feature. It minimizes missing cases of the disease whose symptoms are mild or even very mild. 57-59 Evaluation is repeated in 3-year cycles. Calculations of national and state-by-state prevalence figures as well as estimates of future prevalence are extrapolated from the CHAP data and incorporate age, sex and race: (1) risk of developing dementia due to Alzheimer's, (2) increased risk of mortality among those with dementia due to Alzheimer's, (3) U.S. mortality rates, (4) U.S. education levels. and (5) U.S. current and projected total population.\" Since their first publication in 2003. CHAP produced updated estimates of prevalence in 2013 utilizing 2010 U.S. Bureau of Census population information.\" The Association's 2017 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures prevalence estimates are reported from these data for U.S. residents age 65 or over. Other U.S. based studies have measured either the prevalence or incidence of dementia. Two of note are the Health and Retirement Study-Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Study (HRS- ADAMS) \u2014 a nationally representative sample\"i\" \u2014 and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) \u2014 a study of all-cause dementia over time in Framingham, Massachusetts.\" HRS-ADAMS and FHS have consistently reported estimates that are lower than CHAP estimates. 30.65-52 At a 2009 conference convened by the NIA and the Alzheimer's Association, researchers concluded that these discrepancies were mainly due to differences in diagnostic criteria, differences that reflect the study's different goals. 59HRS-ADAMS defines a case using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria for dementia, incorporating impairments in both cognition and function. 59\" In addition, people exhibiting the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are not counted as having Alzheimer's if they are determined to have vascular dementia. HRS-ADAMS focuses on the severity of disability, not the precision of the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, which is the goal of CHAP. 57.60.52The Framingham Heart Study uses DSM criteria for dementia and the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, an approach that achieves the goal of determining if a case of dementia is caused by Alzheimer's.\" The estimates from each of these studies are often discussed as different numbers measuring the same thing, a conclusion that destabilizes confidence that we can talk coherently about the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. They are in fact different numbers because they are measuring different things in different populations using different means of identifying individuals with all-cause dementia and/or dementia due to Alzheimer's. 59 None of the studies referenced above used biomarkers in their estimates; inclusion of biomarkers would markedly alter estimates of the prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease. As research advances a biomarker-based strategy for detection and treatment at the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, ever more accurate estimates of the number of persons affected will be needed to understand the full extent of that burden. These estimates will very likely be greater than current estimates and will require appropriate, modernized research and public health strategies. ;lir::: 1: - ILATTA'CillM ENT-1 OG 8 fr.arlawish Dement HN, Murtagh H.

Alzheimer's 2017. Alzheimers Dement 2017:13:374-380. End Notes Al Six drugs approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (Mg The FDA has approved six drugs to alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia: tacrine (discontinued in the United States due to potentially severe side effects). galantamine. rivastigmine, donepezil. memantine. and a drug that combines memantine and donepezil. None of these drugs slows or stops the progression of Alzheimer's disease. A2. Number of Americans ...ge 65 ad older with Alzheimer's dementia for 2017 (Prevalence of Alzheimer's in 2017): The number 5.3 million is from published prevalence estimates based on incidence data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) and population estimates from the 2010 U.S. Census.\" A3. Proportion of Americans age 65 and older with Alzheimer's dementia: The 10 percent for the age 65 and older population is calculated by dividing the estimated number of people age 65 and older with Alzheimer's dementia (5.3 million) by the U.S. population age 65 and older in 2017, as projected by the U.S. Census Bureau (51.1 million). approximately 10 percent.\"' Please note that the proportion of Americans age 65 and older with Alzheimer's dementia has gone down slightly in recent years despite the number of Americans with Alzheimer's dementia in this age range going up: this is because of the large number of baby boomers who have started to enter this age range and increased the overall number of seniors, but at the early low risk years in this range.\" A4 Percentage of total Alzheimer's dementia rases by age \u00b0roues' Percentages for each age group are based on the estimated 200.000 people under 65.\" plus the estimated numbers for people ages 65 to 74(0.9 million). 75 to 84(2.4 million), and 85+ (2.1 million) based on prevalence estimates for each age group and incidence data from the CHAP study. Prevalence numbers for age groups do not total 5.5 million due to rounding. AS. Differences between CHAP and ADAMS estimates for Alzheimer's dementia prevalence: ADAMS estimated the prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia to be lower than CHAP, at 2.3 million Americans age 71 and older in 2002. 1\" while the CHAP estimate for 2000 was 4.5 million.' At a 2009 conference convened by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association, researchers determined that this discrepancy was mainly due to two differences in diagnostic criteria: (1) a diagnosis of dementia in ADAMS required impairments in daily functioning and (2) people determined to have vascular dementia in ADAMS were not also counted as having Alzheimer's. even if they exhibited clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's.\" Because the more stringent threshold for dementia in ADAMS may miss people with mild Alzheimer's dementia and because clinical-pathologic studies have shown that mixed dementia due to both Alzheimer's and vascular pathology in the brain is very common.\u00b0 the Association believes that the larger CHAP estimates may be a more relevant estimate of the burden of Alzheimer's dementia in the United States. A6. Number of women and men age 65 and older with Alzheimer's dementia in the I inited Stater The estimates for the number of U.S. women (3.3 million) and men (2.0 million) age 65 and older with Alzheimer's in 2013 is from unpublished data from CHAP. For analytic methods, see Hebert et al.\" A7. Prevalence of Alzheimer's and other dementias in older whites African-Americans and Hispanics: The statement that African- Americans are twice as likely and Hispanics one and one-half times as likely as whites to have Alzheimer's or other dementias is the conclusion of an expert review of a number of multiracial and multi-ethnic data sources, as reported in detail in the Special Report of the Alzheimer's Association's 2010 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures. AS. State-by-state Prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia: These state-by-state prevalence numbers are based on an analysis of incidence data from CHAP, projected to each state's population. with adjustments for state-specific age. gender, years of education. race and mortality.'\" Specific prevalence numbers projected for each year from 2014 to 2025 derived from this analysis were provided to the Alzheimer's Association by a team led by Liesi Hebert. Sc.0., from Rush University Institute on Healthy Aging. A9. Number of new Cases of Alzheimer's dementia this year (incidence of Alzheimer's in 2017) . The East Boston Established Populations for Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) estimated that there would be 454,000 new cases in 2010 and 491,000 new cases in 2020 (see Hebert et al l\"). The Alzheimer's Association calculated the incidence of new cases in 2017 by multiplying the 10-year change from 454.000 to 491.000(37.000) by 0.7 (for the number of years from 2010 to 2017 divided by the number of years from 2010 to 2020), adding that result (25,900) to the Hebert et al, estimate for 2010 (454.000). 479.900.' 5\u00b0 Rounded to the nearest thousand, this is 480.000 new cases of Alzheimer's dementia in 2017. The same technique for linear interpolation from 2010 to 2020 projections was used to calculate the number of new cases in 2017 for ages 65-74. 75-84 and 85 and older. The age group-specific Alzheimer's dementia incident rate is the number of new people with Alzheimer's per population at risk (the total number of people in the age group in question). These incidence rates are expressed as number of new cases per 1.000 people using the total number of people per age group (e.g., 65-74. 75-84. 85+) for 2017 from population projections from the 2000 U.S. Census as the denominator.\"' A10 Number of seconds for the development of a new rase of Alzheimer's dementia: Although Alzheimer's does not present suddenly like stroke or heart attack, the rate at which new cases develop can be computed in a similar way. The 66 seconds number is calculated by dividing the number of seconds in a year (31.536.000) by the number of new cases in a year (479,90\" = 65.7 seconds. rounded to 66 seconds. Using the same method of calculation for 2050, 31.536.000 divided by 959.000 (from Hebert et al.\") = 32.8 seconds, rounded to 33 seconds. All. Criteria for identifyina People with Alzheimer's or other dementias in the Framingham Study' From 1975 to 2009,7.901 people from the Framingham Study who had survived free of dementia to at least age 45. and 5.937 who had survived free of dementia until at least age 65 were followed for incidence of dementia.\"' Diagnosis of dementia was made according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria and required that the participant survive for at least 6 months after onset of symptoms. Standard diagnostic criteria (the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria from 1984) were used to diagnose Alzheimer's dementia. The definition of Alzheimer's and other clemencies used in the Framingham Study was very strict: if a definition that included milder disease and disease of less than six months' duration were used, lifetime risks of Alzheimer's and other dementias would be higher than those estimated by this study. Al2 Proiected number of people with Alzheimer's dementia: This figure comes from the CHAP study\" Other projections are somewhat lower (see, for example. Brookmeyer et al.\") because they relied on more conservative methods for counting people who currently have Alzheimer's dementia.\" Nonetheless, these estimates are statistically consistent with each other, and all projections suggest substantial growth in the number of people with Alzheimer's dementia over the coming decades. ATTACHMENT-10G 165 Appendices 71 All Projected number of people aae 65 and older with Alzheimer's demPntia in 2025: The number 71 million is based on a linear extrapolation from the projections of prevalence of Alzheimer's for the years 2020 (5.8 million) and 2030 (8.4 million) from CHAP.\" A14. Previous high and low Projections of Alzheimer's dnmentia prevalence in 2050 High and low prevalence projections for 2050 from the U.S. Census were not available for the most recent analysis of CHAP data.\" The previous high and low projections indicate that the projected number of Americans with Alzheimer's in 2050 age 65 and older will range from 11 to 16 million? 0' 415. Annual mortality rate due to Alzheimer's disease by state' Unadjusted death rates are presented rather than age-adjusted death rates in order to provide a clearer depiction of the true burden of mortality for each state. States such as Florida with larger populations of older people will have a larger burden of mortality due to Alzheimer's \u2014 a burden that appears smaller relative to other states when the rates are adjusted for age. 416. Number of family and other unDaid caregivers of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias: To calculate this number. the Alzheimer's Association started with data from the BRFSS survey. In 2009, the BRFSS survey asked respondents age 18 and over whether they had provided any regular care or assistance during the past month to a family member or friend who had a health problem. long-term illness or disability. To determine the number of family and other unpaid caregivers nationally and by state. we applied the proportion of caregivers nationally and for each state from the 2009 BRFSS (as provided by the CDC. Healthy Aging Program. unpublished data) to the number of people age 18 and older nationally and in each state from the U.S. Census Bureau report for July 2016. Available at: censusgov/programs-surveys/popest/data/ tables.html. Accessed Jan. 4. 2017. To calculate the proportion of family and other unpaid caregivers who provide care for a person with Alzheimer's or another dementia. the Alzheimer's Association used data from the results of a national telephone survey also conducted in 2009 for the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC)/ AARP.'\" The NAC/AARP survey asked respondents age 18 and over whether they were providing unpaid care for a relative or friend age 18 or older or had provided such care during the past 12 months. Respondents who answered affirmatively were then asked about the health problems of the person for whom they provided care. In response. 26 percent of caregivers said that: (1) Alzheimer's or another dementia was the main problem of the person for whom they provided care, or (2) the person had Alzheimer's or other mental confusion in addition to his or her main problem. The 26 percent figure was applied to the total number of caregivers nationally and in each state, resulting in a total of 15.975 million Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers. 417. The 2014 Alzheimer's Association Women and Alzheimer's Poll: This poll questioned a nationally representative sample of 3,102 American adults about their attitudes, knowledge and experiences related to Alzheimer's and dementia from Jan. 9.2014. to Jan. 29, 2014. An additional 512 respondents who provided unpaid help to a relative or friend with Alzheimer's or a related dementia were asked questions about their care provision. Random selections of telephone numbers from landline and cell phone exchanges throughout the United States were conducted. One individual per household was selected from the Iandline sample, and cell phone respondents were selected if they were 18 years old or older. Interviews were administered in English and Spanish. The poll \"oversampled\" Hispanics, selected from U.S. Census tracts with higher than an 8 percent concentration of this group. A list sample of Asian-Americans was also utilized to oversample this group. A general population weight was used to adjust for number of adults in the household and telephone usage: the second stage of this weight balanced the sample to estimated U.S. population characteristics. A weight for the caregiver sample accounted for the increased likelihood of female and white respondents in the caregiver sample. Sampling weights were also created to account for the use of two supplemental list samples. The resulting interviews comprise a probability-based, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. A caregiver was defined as an adult over age 18 who, in the past 12 months, provided unpaid care to a relative or friend age 50 or older with Alzheimer's or another dementia. Questionnaire design and interviewing were conducted by Abt SRBI of New York, 418. Number of hours of unpaid care' To calculate this number. the Alzheimer's Association used data from a follow-up analysis of results from the 2009 NAC/AARP national telephone survey (data provided under contract by Matthew Greenwald and Associates, Nov. 11, 2009). These data show that caregivers of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias provided an average of 21.9 hours a week of care. or 1.139 hours per year. The number of family and other unpaid caregivers (15.975 million) .\" was multiplied by the average hours of care per year. which totals 18.191 billion hours of care. This is slightly higher than the total resulting from multiplying 18.191 billion by 15.975 million because 15.975 is a rounded figure for the total number of caregivers. 419. Value of unpaid caregiving: To calculate this number, the Alzheimer's Association used the method of Amo et al.\" This method uses the average of the federal minimum hourly wage ($7.25 in 2016) and the mean hourly wage of home health aides (518.05 in July 2016).' The average is 612.65. which was multiplied by the number of hours of unpaid care (18.191 billion) to derive the total value of unpaid care ($230.127 billion; this is slightly higher than the total resulting from multiplying $12.65 by 18.191 billion because 18.191 is a rounded number for the hours of unpaid care). A20. Higher health care costs of Alzheimer's raregivers: This figure is based on a methodology originally developed by Brent Fulton. Ph.D.. for The Shriver Report:A Woman's Notion Takes on Alzheimer's. A survey of 17,000 employees of a multinational firm based in the United States estimated that caregivers' health care costs were 8 percent higher than non-caregivers'.\" To determine the dollar amount represented by that 8 percent figure nationally and in each state. the 8 percent figure and the proportion of caregivers from the 2009 BRFSS\" . were used to weight each states caregiver and non-caregiver per capita personal health care spending in 2009.\" inflated to 2016 dollars. The dollar amount difference between the weighted per capita personal health care spending of caregivers and non-caregivers in each state (reflecting the 8 percent higher costs for caregivers) produced the average additional health care costs for caregivers in each state. Nationally. this translated into an average of $680. The amount of the additional cost in each state, which varied by state from a low of $501 in Utah to a high of $1.037 in the District of Columbia. was multiplied by the total number of unpaid Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers in that state*\" to arrive at that states total additional health care costs of Alzheimer's and other dementia caregivers as a result of being a caregiver The combined total for all states was $10.852 billion. Fulton concluded that this is \"likely to be a conservative estimate because caregiving for people with Alzheimer's is more stressful than caregiving for most people who don't have the disease.'\" 421.1 ewin Model on Alzheimer's and dementia costs: These numbers come from a model created for the Alzheimer's Association by the Lewin Group.The model estimates total payments for health care. long-term care and hospice \u2014 as well as state-by-state Medicaid spending \u2014 for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. The model was updated by the Lewin Group in January 2015 (updating previous model) and June 2015 (addition of state-by-state Medicaid ATTACHMENT- 10G 72 Alzheimer's Association. 2017 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figuitteimer ls & Dementia 2017:13:325-373. estimates). Detailed information on the model, its long-term projections and its methodology are available at alzorgArajectory. For the purposes of the data presented in this report, the following parameters of the model were changed relative to the methodology outlined at alz.orgArajectory. (1) cost data from the 2011 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) were used rather than data from the 2008 MCBS: (2) prevalence among older adults was assumed to equal the prevalence levels from Hebert et al\" and included in this report (5.3 million in 2017).\" rather than the prevalence estimates derived by the model itself: (3) estimates of inflation and excess cost growth reflect the most recent relevant estimates from the cited sources (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [CMS] actuaries and the Congressional Budget Office); and (4) the most recent (2014) state-by-state data from CMS on the number of nursing home residents and percentage with moderate and severe cognitive impairment were used in lieu of 2012 data. A22. All cost estimates were inflated to year 7016 dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CEO: All cost estimates were inflated using the seasonally adjusted average prices for medical care services from all urban consumers. The relevant item within medical care services was used for each cost element. For example, the medical care item within the CPI was used to inflate total health care payments: the hospital services item within the CPI was used to inflate hospital payments: and the nursing home and adult day services item within the CPI was used to inflate nursing home payments. A23. Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey Renoir: These data come from an analysis of findings from the 2011 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The analysis was conducted for the Alzheimer's Association by Avalere Health.'\" The MCBS, a continuous survey of a nationally representative sample of about 15.000 Medicare beneficiaries. is linked to Medicare claims. The survey is supported by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). For community-dwelling survey participants. MCBS interviews are conducted in person three times a year with the Medicare beneficiary or a proxy respondent if the beneficiary is not able to respond. For survey participants who are living in a nursing home or another residential care facility. such as an assisted living residence. retirement home or a long-term care unit in a hospital or mental health facility. MCBS interviews are conducted with a staff member designated by the facility administrator as the most appropriate to answer the questions. Data from the MCBS analysis that are included in 2017 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures pertain only to Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older For this MCBS analysis. people with dementia are defined as: Community-dwelling survey participants who answered yes to the MCBS question. Has a doctor ever told you that you had Alzheimer's disease or dementia?\" Proxy responses to this question were accepted. Survey participants who were living in a nursing home or other residential care facility and had a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia in their medical record. Survey participants who had at least one Medicare claim with a diagnostic code for Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2008. The claim could be for any Medicare service, including hospital. skilled nursing facility. outpatient medical care. home health care, hospice or physician. or other health care provider visit. The diagnostic codes used to identify survey participants with Alzheimer's or the MCBS analysis are based an responses from 2011 and reported in 2016 dollars. A24. Differenres in estimated costs reported by Hurd and colleagues' Hurd et al. 23' estimated per-person costs using data from participants in ADAMS, a cohort in which all individuals underwent diagnostic assessments for dementia. 2017 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures estimated per-person costs using data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). One reason that the per-person costs estimated by Hurd et al. are lower than those reported in Facts and Figures is that ADAMS, with its diagnostic evaluations of everyone in the study. is more likely than MCBS to have identified individuals with less severe or undiagnosed Alzheimer's. By contrast, the individuals with Alzheimer's registered by MCBS are likely to be those with more severe, and therefore more costly, illness. A second reason is that Hurd et al's estimated costs reflect an effort to isolate the incremental costs associated with Alzheimer's and other dementias (those casts attributed only to dementia). while the per-person costs in 2017 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures incorporate all costs of caring for people with the disease (regardless of whether the expenditure was related to dementia or a coexisting condition).

ItismyunderstandingthattheAldenGtouP, Ltd., through its affiliates, proposes to build a 114-bed skilled rehabilitation and health care center and a 52-bed memory care facility in this area, adjacent to Silver Cross Hospital. With Silver Cross Hospital being adjacent to this location, this development will be a terrific continuum of care for the Village. As the population continues to age and grow in and around theNew Lenox area, these services are very much needed. Specifically, there is a shortage of appropriate care for residents with dementia who receive Medicare and Medicaid benefits. I have patients who have not had proper placement for care and itwas detrimental to their \\ wit-being. Over the years, I have referred approximately 20 patients per month for skilled care and 2 patients for memory care to facilities farther than the proposed Alden project location in New Lenox. I could refer to the proposed project approximately 20 patientspermonth for skilled care and 2 patients for memory care within a 12-month period after the project is completed, and anticipate the referral volume to remain similar or grow for the next two years. My patient volume originates nearly 90% from within 30-minute travel time of the new Silver Cross Hospital campus (which I am on staff at) and! would expect my referral to be respective of those origins.

Identify ALL of the alternatives to the proposed project: Alternative options must include: a. Proposing a project of greater or lesser scope and cost: b. Pursuing a joint venture or similar arrangement with one or more providers or entities to meet all or a portion of the project's intended purposes; developing alternative settings to meet all or a portion of the project's intended purposes; c. Utilizing other health care resources that are available to serve all or a portion of the population proposed to be served by the project; and d. Provide the reasons why the chosen alternative was selected. 2. Documentation shall consist of a comparison of the proiect to alternative options. The comparison shall address issues of total costs, patient access, quality and financial benefits in both the short term (within one to three years after project completion) and long term. This may vary by project or situation. FOR EVERY ALTERNATIVE IDENTIFIED THE TOTAL PROJECT COST AND THE REASONS WHY THE ALTERNATIVE WAS REJECTED MUST BE PROVIDED. This project presents a situation that has become more common in areas around the State of Illinois in terms of health planning. The dichotomy is that within the Will County Planning Area there is currently an outstanding need for 274 nursing care beds which includes the Applicant's already permitted 140 beds (15-051) according to the 01/10/2018 Update to Inventory of the 2017 IDPH, Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations, Volume 2, Market Area Nursing Beds Utilization Parts VI-VII, Long-Term Care Services (see ATTACHMENT-11A). However, at the same time. the State's latest available information (IDPH, Long- Illinois 97,752 74.0% Will Co. 2,699 185 73.0% Source: LTC Fac. Questionnaire for 2016, IDPH, Health Systems Development Term Care Questionnaire Data for 2016) shows that many facilities have utilization rates that are under the State's optimal rate of 90 percent (77 Illinois Administrative Code, Chapter II, Section 1 1 25.210.c). See ATTACHMENT-HR for the 2017 IDPH ATTACHMENT-11 191 SECTION II\u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued x Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations, Volume2, Parts VI-VW Long-Term Care Summary Profiles. It is hard to balance these two issues since the identified need for additional nursing beds is also significantly high in the neighboring Kendall County (121 beds needed), and Grundy County (4 beds needed) as identified in ATTACHMENT-11A. For the proposed market area, the State's identified need for additional capacity makes sense in that the community of New Lenox has no immediate accessibility to nursing services either for general geriatric or specialized dementia care nursing services. Therefore, the alternatives to the project as proposed are limited. The alternatives that were considered include: \"Maintain the Status Quo -. \"Establish a smaller Project\", \"Establish a Larger Project\" and the \"Project as Proposed\". It should be noted that all alternatives are limited based on the issue that there are no existing facilities to partner with in New Lenox or within nearly 5-miles / 10-minutes travel time (primary market area) from the proposed site and there is only an identified need for 274 nursing beds which is in addition to the Applicant's already permitted 140 beds (15-051). MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO Total Costs There are no capital costs associated with this alternative. The true cost of this alternative is the inaccessibility to general and memory support long-term care services for the residents of New Lenox and those of the entire Planning Area that the proposed market area is part of Specifically, this alternative maintains that there will be a large need for 390 nursing beds throughout the entire Health Service Area 9, which includes the Will County Planning Area that by itself supports 274 additional beds which is in addition to the Applicant's already permitted ATTACHMENT-11 192 SECTION II\u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued xi 140 beds (15-051) (see ATTACHMENT-11A), according to the Long-Term Care Facility Update, January 10, 2018 to the 2017 1DPH Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Facilities and Services and Need Determinations, Volume 2, Parts VI-VII, Long-Term Care Services. Moreover, there appears to be an inverse maldistribution of services in New Lenox. A typical maldistribution is that there would be too many beds in one area. Here, there are no beds in the primary market area to support the population. Coupled with the State's identified need for beds, there is inherently a lack of nursing services within the proposed market. Patient Access Patient access is non-existent in New Lenox and the New Lenox Township as illustrated herein. The map on the left was provided by IDPH. HFSRB staff and the dots identify where nursing facilities are. Again, no long-tent care facilities are within the Village or Township of New Lenox. Out of the total of 47 nursing facilities within a 30-minute travel time as identified by the State Board Staff Report for Project #15-051 (see '2i1r5 DATCFROrPUBLISlil e Service Area 2020 Projected Population 2017 Inventory Lic. Beds 2020 Projected 65+ Pop 2020 Projected 65+ Pop: 1 bed Illinois Will Source Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations 2017 Long-Term Care Services ATTACHMENT-11C), only one is right at. or just within. 5 miles or 10 minutes. There are only four facilities in less than 10 miles or 15-minute travel time. More than half (34) of the facilities are greater than 20 minutes travel time from the proposed site. When the ATTACHMENT-11 193 SECTION II\u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS continued xii 30-minute market area contour as identified by the State Board Staff Report for Project #15-051 is analyzed, there is accessibility to nursing services, yet the immediate Zip Code area for the Village of New Lenox has the population to support the majority of the beds being proposed by itself (refer to ATTACHMENT-11D). The Planning area also has the second highest ratio of population to beds of the surrounding Planning Service Area's with identified bed needs (refer to ATTACHMENT-11B). The State's new bed need inventory, in and of itself, implies that there is an accessibility issue. The bed need calculation uses the historical use rates and applies them forward. Before one additional bed is needed, the entire existing inventory capacity at 90% is factored in first and, therefore, if there is a need it comes only after the existing beds are presumed filled. Finally, in addition to the ratio of population per nursing bed. the 30-minute market area is surrounded by Grundy County, Kankakee County and Kendall County Planning Areas that make up Health Service Area 9, which cumulatively calculate a need for 390 additional nursing care beds (refer to ATTACHMENT-1A). Therefore, this alternative does not enhance patient accessibility and as such was not determined to be viable. Quality The issue as presented here is about accessibility and not quality. The Applicant states and continues to offer its commitment to the highest quality in care and in physical plant environment, but this alternative restricts the accessibility of those in need of long-term care for general geriatric and dementia nursing care. This alternative does not allow for greater quality of care for both the ADRD residents and the general geriatric residents as the populations will have to seek services in out-of-area facilities as the use rates continue to increase. ATTACHMENT-11 194 SECTION II \u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued xlii Financial Benefits As there is no project cost and no nursing services available within the primary market area, there can be no financial benefits as there is nothing to benefit from. In fact, there would appear to be a cost. The population of New Lenox, especially those 65 and over, are at a disadvantage. This population must seek long-term care at a significant distance. As stated and documented there are no nursing beds within New Lenox, or for nearly a 5 mile/10-minute radius, of the proposed site. New Lenox (Zip Code area 60451) is a newer community with a fast-growing population (between the 2000 and 2010 census's), but more importantly it is one that has a large percent of elderly persons. The over 65 age cohort grew by 60.8% (1,846 persons to 2,968 respectively). Refer to ATTACHMENT-11D. This elderly growth rate increased more rapidly than the area on a whole which still posted an impressive growth rate of 24.6%. The population has also received a new hospital, Silver Cross's replacement hospital. The vertical referral arraignments that this project can establish being adjacent to the hospital is invaluable and provides untold financial benefits for both enterprises, especially in light of the affordable care act pushing everything down stream. This alternative does not allow that to happen and as such was considered not viable. ESTABLISH A SMALLER PROTECT Total Costs It is presumed that the cost of establishing a smaller nursing facility would be less in a proportionate share of the total cost of the proposed project adjusted for the number of beds. Thus, the proposed project has 166 nursing beds at a total cost of $39.615.616 or $238,648 per bed. That, however, is not entirely true. There are expensive components of a project such as Mechanical/Electrical, Elevators and Kitchen that are fairly fixed. This means, to justify the cost ATTACHMENT-11 195 SECTION II \u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued xiv of those spaces, a certain number of beds are needed. That level has traditionally equated to the State's Licensure standard of 75 nursing beds to a nurses' station. When the proposed project is analyzed one will really see two facilities: one is a 114-bed nursing unit for general geriatric nursing services (rehabilitative), and one that is only 52 beds for the innovative care of those with memory impairments. As such, this is already appropriately sized and to consider the costs of a smaller project could harm the overall financial viability of a project. Patient Access The Applicant explored the alternative of only constructing and establishing services for a lesser number of nursing beds. Alden's dilemma is, which will they make smaller, the 114-bed general nursing facility or the already small Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia unit. The project could conceivably eliminate the 52-bed memory unit and only proceed with the general nursing building, and while it represents a smaller project and a potentially smaller cost, access to memory care nursing services would not be had. If they were to keep the 52-bed memory care unit and reduce the general nursing facility, the project runs the risk of not providing the economies-of-scale to supplement the memory care unit. It should be noted that memory care services are not a reimbursed cost as many other services are, even though it takes specialized care and programming, and to really do it right a separate facility specifically designed around an ADRD program is needed. Moreover, there is a need for 274 nursing care beds (which includes the Applicant's already permitted 140 beds (15-051)) in the Will County Planning Area and the proposed community of New Lenox (Zip Code Area 60451) has no existing nursing beds once the approved project (15-051) is abandoned. The ratio of population to beds for the State are presented, if applied to the New Lenox (Zip Code Area 60451) total population (34,063 persons) and 65 and over age cohort (2,968 persons), this area by itself could ATTACHMENT-11 196 SECTION II\u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS continued xv Nursing Bed Need Projected from State and Planning Area Ratio of Pop. to Nursing Beds _ __ _ 2020 Projected Population 2017 Inventory Lic.

The only way that the Applicant would consider the alternative of a lesser level of care would be under the context of a continuum of care retirement community (CCRC non-variance CON), which is the trend of future growth in the long-term care industry. A CCRC campus environment includes the lesser levels of care such as independent, assisted/supportive living or even sheltered care. However, the cornerstone of a CCRC is the nursing unit. This type of comprehensive environment allows residents to age-in-place so when they become most frail and vulnerable they do not have to leave their \"home\", i.e., the CCRC campus, for nursing services. Typically, the industry has found that the Applicant would need a five to one ratio of campus beds to nursing beds; thus, just to address the beds being proposed (166), the Applicant would also have to build 830 independent and assisted/supportive living (or sheltered care units). The CCRC variances through the State's own rules are contrary to open accessibility for general geriatric residents. Although it is the intent of the Applicant to allow residents to age-in-place, any potential plan for a campus would not be available in time to satisfy the 2020 demand in a single campus setting. It is important to also note that the 30-minute travel time contour fully resembles that of the State in terms of total growth and elderly growth. Both approaches are consistent and show high continued population increases. It is also the intent of the Applicant to build and care for the general geriatric ATTACHMENT-11 197 SECTION II \u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued xvi rehabilitative residents and the more specialized memory care residents of the Planning Area, which is not the same as the 30-minute market contour. The cause of this is based on the State's rules, i.e., 77 Illinois Administrative Code, Chapter II, Section 1125.580a)I) of Subchapter a, which states that the Applicant must also address beds and services under a \"30 minute travel time- from the proposed site. This forces the Applicant to draw a service area contour that overlaps Planning Areas in this particular case. Since the need appears to be so overwhelming for Health Service Area 9, and the Will County Planning Area specifically (refer to ATTACHMENT-11B), the Applicant rejects the alternative to establish a lesser number of nursing beds. Quality The issue as presented here is about accessibility and not quality. The Applicant states that it is committed to provide the highest quality in care and in physical plant environment whether in the project as being proposed (establishment) or in this alternative. Financial Benefits The issue with this alternative is that the proposed project is not your traditional nursing facility. Today, most new facilities cater only to the rehabilitative side of nursing care as dictated by the changing long-term care and health care environment. This project uses traditional nursing care to supplement the ability to provide specialized and innovative memory care. As such, this alternative restricts potential financial benefits that allow for the supplementing of these needed services. Therefore, this alternative was rejected. ESTABLISH A LARGER PROJECT Total Costs There is a calculated need for 390 nursing care beds throughout the entire Health Service ATTACHMENT-11 198 SECTION II\u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued xyli Area 9, which includes the Will County Planning Area. This number is too voluminous for an Applicant to even consider, and there would be no consistent features such as land, construction type, staffing, administration, etc. Furthermore, just addressing the Will County Planning Area. a 274-bed facility in any single community, let alone New Lenox, would appear to create a maldistribution of services and it would be in excess of the 250-bed capacity criterion (77 Illinois Administrative Code, Chapter II, Section 1125.600). As the proposed project has a total per bed cost of $238,648, a 274-bed facility would cost over $65,389,552 compared to the $39 million proposed. Therefore, it appears safe to estimate total costs for this alternative to far outweigh those being proposed. Patient Access Patient accessibility could actually be damaged having all new nursing beds needed in one community within the Will County Planning Area. Locating 274 beds in one community, although central throughout the Planning Area, could cause accessibility issues in the various other communities such as the accessibility issue present in New Lenox. Quality The issue as presented here is about accessibility and not quality. The Applicant states that it is committed to providing the highest quality in care and in physical plant environment regardless of bed capacity or size; that being said, there are quality concerns when a project becomes too big or institutional. Financial Benefits Although the potential income from so many beds identified in this alternative could be desirable, institutional sized facilities are not popular. Therefore, realizing financial benefits for this alternative most likely would not be viable. The Applicant's intent with the size of the project was to effectively create no impact on the area's existing facilities, while satisfying the ATTACHMENT-11 199 SECTION II \u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued xviii need for beds in New Lenox and the Will County Planning Area. Therefore, to proceed with this alternative, and thereby potentially impacting the utilization of other area facilities, could cause negative financial benefits for all. Thus, this alternative was considered not viable. THE PROJECT AS PROPOSED Total Costs The proposed project cost is $39,615,616. Patient Access The proposed project improves accessibility in a responsible fashion. The project establishes a service in a substantially sized community with a large number of seniors that are currently not directly served. However, the project does not intend to improve the ratio of population to each nursing bed to a number more in line with that of the State's. The beds needed are derived from a five-year projection and for each entire county. As the proposed project's market contour takes in four Planning Service Areas, the 166 beds proposed are appropriate to ensure access without harming accessibility to other area facilities. Moreover, the 166 nursing beds are not solely serving a general geriatric or rehabilitative resident. It is important to remember that 52 of the total nursing beds will be located in a connected but separate and distinct building specifically designed for residents suffering with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). Alden Courts of New Lenox, the memory support building, will be a one-story structure providing for the early, mid and late stages of memory support. Since all beds will be certified for both Medicare and Medicaid, those residents would not have to be transferred to the appropriate level of care should their medical needs change. A narrative of the Applicant's Dementia Memory Care Program is appended as ATTACHMENT-1W. The nursing category ATTACHMENT-11 200 SECTION II\u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued xix of service allows the Applicant the ability to care for residents should their funds become exhausted or if they have limited financial resources. Traditionally, specialized care is private pay and there is no specific reimbursement for ADRD nursing care. However, as a nursing care facility dually certified for Medicare and Medicaid, this specific population will have access to rehabilitative care should their medical situation require it. Medicaid will cover the cost of general nursing care so that the resident would not have to be discharged. In addition to the ability to care for a wider range of Alzheimer's residents, there appears to be a need for this innovative service. According to the Alzheimer's Association, in 2017 there were 220,000 people over 65+ suffering with ADRD in Illinois (refer to ATTACHMENT- 10G). According to the 2010 Census, Illinois has 1,603,829 people in that age cohort (refer to ATTACHMENT-11F). That implies that 13.7% of those 65 and over are afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. In addition, according to the statewide IDPH Profile from the 2016 Annual Questionnaire Data (appended as ATTACHMENT-11B), 7.3% of those in nursing beds have ADRD as a primary diagnosis. Projecting those percentages on the New Lenox population (Zip Code Area 60451), New Lenox itself can support between 217-386 ADRD beds. Quality The issue as presented here is about accessibility and not quality. The Applicant states that it is committed to provide the highest quality in care and in physical plant environment regardless of bed capacity or size. Moreover, the Applicant only has the highest appreciation for the other nursing providers in the area. Therefore, quality is not of issue or of great concern. Financial Benefits Through the Applicant's ability address the accessibility issue of New Lenox (Zip Code Area 60451) and the Will County Planning Area. this Applicant will have the ability not only to ATTACHMENT-11 201 SECTION II \u2014 PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT, AND ALTERNATIVES \u2014 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Continued xx benefit financially from the operations, but the residents of New Lenox may benefit also. As these elderly residents continue to age, they will not have to leave the community for nursing services. There is a resultant financial benefit of less travel for loved ones, friends and family members and for the community who will be able to keep their residents and their economic impact. There are many intangible financial benefits but there are also the one that result in jobs and the additional tax base income for the community. Due to this alternative's ability to address the issue of accessibility, its ability to offer a service in a quality manner that is indicative of the other Alden facilities, and it allows for multiple financial benefits, this alternative was considered the most viable. 3. The applicant shall provide empirical evidence, including quantified outcome data that verifies improved quality of care. as available. The alternative of the \"Project as Proposed\" is based on the identified bed need (274 in Will County Planning Area which includes the Applicant's already permitted 140 beds (15-051)) and the need for specific ADRD beds within the Applicant's 30-minute market contour as identified by the State Board Staff Report for Project #15-051. Therefore, this alternative is not based solely or in part on improved quality of care. Moreover, there are no nursing beds in New Lenox, a community with over 24,000 residents. The State has one nursing bed for every 141.4 persons or one nursing beds for every 22.5 seniors (65+). This would appear to suggest that New Lenox (Zip Code area 60451) alone could support 131.9-240.9 nursing beds. Therefore, this item would appear to be not applicable.

Creating a home like-environment provides the residents with a sense of familiarity, comfort, and love.

Furthermore, this program is dedicated to providing an environment that helps to stimulate and maintain a resident's level of cognitive functioning. Furthermore, staff develop relationships with patience, compassion and love. Dementia Care Units are secure, and promote safety, health, and wellbeing. Pathways Memory Care Program The Pathways Program is divided into three life skills/activity programming areas to capture the variety of cognitive levels that are exhibited on the dementia care units. They are as follows: Memory Strengthening Program The Memory Path Program is a program dedicated to those residents who are a high level of cognitive functioning. These residents may score high on cognitive testing, alert and oriented to the unit, staff, family, and other residents; they understand the structure of the Pathways Program. This program provides the following: Engagement: This part of the program places emphasis of having residents assists other residents. These residents help to run activities, such as Bingo, JackPot, trivia, exercise, etc. These residents may enjoy helping to decorate for holidays, help hand out clothing protectors at meals, etc. This part of the program gives a resident a sense of belonging and helpfulness to others. Enhancement: This part of the program focuses on memory enhancement These residents participate in memory/mind games, reading, trivia, etc, that help to maintain their knowledge and stimulate the mind. They may also participate in reminiscence and life skill activities. This program may be task oriented, with supervision rather than hands on assistance. Evoking: This part of the program also has a resident meeting, where the residents meet and discuss what activities they would like to see the dementia care unit. These residents also are given structure, but they are encouraged to still make ATTACHMENT-11E 211 choices as so what they would like to be active in and what they would like to do to participate. The purpose of this portion of the program is to bring out their talents, abilities, choices, and individuality. Memory Path Program: The Memory Path Program is for those residents who require support and memory evoking programming in order to find a \"path: to their memories and emotions. These residents may have cognitive function varying more often; require more assistance with activities of daily living, redirection and support. The Memory Path Program Provides the following: Engagement: This level of the program is dedicated to providing person centered engagement Understanding the best cues and redirection techniques are key to maximizing participation and creating a connection with the program taking place. Furthermore, staff must understand the best approaches may vary day to day or even minute to minute. Enhancement: This level of the program is dedicated to enhancing residents' emotions and sensory stimulation. Sights, sounds, smells are incorporated into their routine. Stimulating feelings within our residents can help to access memories and emotions that require stimulation to make a connection to their memories. Types of activities include baking, reminiscing, where many senses are stimulated at once. Evoking: The program focus is to evoke emotions, feelings, sensations. This part of the program does stress that at any time of the day, during any activity, the staff can evoke feelings of care and comfort in our residents. The Emotion Path Program The emotions plan program is a fink to emotions that stimulate feelings and/or memories. This is important throughout stages of programming for Alzheimer's; however this program emphasizes the senses, as residents abilities to demonstrate understanding and communicate their needs is limited to none in this stage. Engagement: Resident Engagement is created by stimulating the senses. Sensory stimulation and programming is an aspect of all three programs; however in this activity program engagement is developed through response of sight, sound, touch, taste and smell. The focus is on stimulating the five senses daily; examples of these activities are taste testing, music, hand massages, etc. The use of Montessori activities are also used, to maintain abilities the residents still can maintain (for example, wrapping yarn around a soda bottle can help maintain the ability to move the hand). ATTACHMENT-11E 212 Enhancement: This level of the program uses engagement of the senses to evoke memories. Feelings are not affected by the disease, and emotions/feelings are used to evoke those feelings. Evoking: This part of the program is about providing emotional support and love to our residents. These are the \"unscheduled\" moments were staff provide hugs, touch, and care, to evoke pleasant moments.

Yes, we are having something like a Y2K issue with our ancient computer system, and apparently it's not an easy fix. We don't even enter 2020 or 2018 in our system, we just enter a date like 01/01/20, and the system is freaking out and spitting out 1920. Our IT is aware and working on it as we have around 50 facilities with a 1920 date, and more to come this month too. We will of course replace everyone's license with corrected versions, but at this time, there is no ETA as IT tries to figure out how to fix it. Sorry!

Identify the calculated number of beds needed (excess) in the planning area. See HFSRB website (http://hfsrb.illinois.gov ) and click on \"Health Facilities Inventories & Data -. According to the Update to the 2017 IDPH Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations, Volume2, Parts VI-V11, Long-Term Care Services dated January 10, 2018 the Board's vvebsite identifies a need of 274 nursing care beds in Health Service Area 9, Will County Planning Area which includes the Applicant's already permitted 140 beds (15-051). It is interesting to also note that the two Planning Areas (Kendall and Grundy) directly to the west of proposed projects' location in Will County, also show a calculated need of 121 nursing beds and 4 nursing beds respectively. Refer to ATTACHMENT-13A for the above referenced Update to Inventory dated January 10, 2018. 2. Attest that the primary purpose of the project is to serve residents of the planning area and that at least 50% of the patients will come from within the planning area. Through the signing of this application, the Applicant attests that the primary purpose of this project is to serve the residents of the Will County Planning Area. More specifically, the location selected for the proposed project is to serve the residents of New Lenox. The population of New Lenox (Zip Code area 60451) itself (34,063) can justify the need ranging from 131.9 up to 240.9 additional general geriatric nursing beds and of between 217-386 memory support nursing beds. This is indicative of more than 50% of the population to be served coming from New Lenox which is within the Will County Planning Area. 3. Provide letters from referral sources (hospitals, physicians, social services and others) that attest to total number of prospective residents (by zip code of residence) who have received care at existing LTC facilities located in the area during the 12-month period prior to submission of the application. Referral sources shall verify their projections and the methodology used, as described in Section 1125.540. Appended as ATTACHMENT-13B, are five (5) physician referral letters providing, to ATTACHMENT-13 254 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued iii the best of their abilities, their historical referrals. Collectively, these physicians have identified 1,320 referrals (1,200 general skilled nursing care and 120 skilled memory care) made to area nursing facilities in the most recent 12-month period. These letters have identified the same number of projected potential annual referrals to Alden Estates-Courts of New Lenox for the next two years. It should be noted that the projected referrals are well within the number of historical referrals made and are more than enough to fill the proposed project's beds given the average length of stay of area facilities (Will County Planning Area's 2016 ALOS of 126.3 days = 769,515 total nursing patient days /6,091 total admissions). Refer to ATTACHMENT-13C for a chart listing the number of admissions and patient days by facility and the resulting average length of stay (ALOS). The ALOS for the 30-minute market contour as identified by the State Board Staff Report for Project #15-05I is 93.6 days. Therefore, it will take 583 annual referrals with this ALOS to fill the facility to its target 90 percent utilization (166 beds x 365 days x 90% = 54,531 patient days). Since 1.320 annual referrals are being estimated, it would appear that there are more than double (2.26 times) the referrals needed to support this project.

Illinois Department of Public Health, Health Systems Development ATTACHMENT-13C 262 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued Iv Criterion 1125.540 - Service Demand \u2014 Establishment of General Long Term Care If the applicant is an existing facility wishing to establish this category of service or a new facility, #1 \u2014 4 must be addressed. Requirements under #5 must also be addressed if applicable. If the applicant is not an existing facility and proposes to establish a new general LTC facility, the applicant shall submit the number of annual projected referrals. I. Document the number of referrals to other facilities, for each proposed category of service, for each of the latest two years. Documentation of the referrals shall include: resident/patient origin by zip code: name and specialty of referring physician or identification of another referral source; and name and location of the recipient LTC facility. Appended as ATTACHMENT-14A are five (5) physician referral letters identifying 1,320 referrals (1,200 general skilled nursing care and 120 skilled memory care) referrals that they have made to area nursing homes for the most recent two years. Each letter has identified the Zip Code areas from which the majority of their patients were derived. 2. Provide letters from referral sources (hospitals, physicians. social services and others) that attest to total number of prospective residents (by zip code of residence) who have received care at existing LTC facilities located in the area during the 12-month period prior to submission of the application. Referral sources shall verify their projections and the methodology used. The physician referral letters appended in ATTACHMENT-14A use the historical referrals to area facilities as their basis of making projections. It should be noted that the physicians reviewed their patient files, and to the level that the information was available, were able to make conservative projections of referrals to the proposed project. It should also be noted that the sources' estimates didn't reference an allowance for increased patient load which is inevitable with the growing 65+ age cohort. 3. Estimate the number of prospective residents whom the referral sources will refer annually to the applicant's facility within a 24-month period after project completion. Please note: ATTACHMENT-14 263 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued v The anticipated number of referrals cannot exceed the referral sources' documented historical LTC caseload. The percentage of project referrals used to justify the proposed expansion cannot exceed the historical percentage of applicant market share, within a 24-month period after project completion. Each referral letter shall contain the referral source's Chief Executive Officer's notarized signature, the typed or printed name of the referral source, and the referral source's address. The referral letters, appended as ATTACHMENT-14A, anticipate monthly referrals of 110 residents (100 residents for general nursing care services and 10 residents for skilled memory care nursing care services). Together, and on an annualized basis, the projected referrals equal 1,320 residents/patients. The historical annual referrals equate to 1,320 patients. Even though the health care providers are facing a substantial increase in the 65+ age cohort, the anticipated referrals were not in excess of the historically documented caseload. Moreover, the 24-month projected referral number is equal to that of the historical projected number. As the Applicant is proposing the establishment of a new facility, the portion of this item to document expansion project is not applicable. It should be noted that each referral letter has the required notarized signature, name and address. 4. Provide verification by the referral sources that the prospective resident referrals have not been used to support another pending or approved Certificate of Need (CON) application for the subiect services. The referral letters, appended as ATTACHMENT-14A, each state that the referrals have not been used to justify or support another Certificate of Need application. 5. If a projected demand for service is based upon rapid population growth in the applicant facility's existing market area (as experienced annually within the latest 24- month period), the projected service demand shall be determined as follows: ATTACHMENT-14 264 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued vi a. The applicant shall define the facility's market area based upon historical resident/patient origin data by zip code or census tract: Although the Applicant's service area is the 30-minute travel area contour as identified by the State Board Staff Report for Project #15-05I, its primary market is the community of New Lenox. There are no existing nursing facilities within New Lenox, the 60451 Zip Code that envelopes it, or the New Lenox Township. Additionally, Will County is experiencing a 15.5% growth in total population as compared to the 4.4% growth experienced in Illinois. This is a three and one-half times greater growth rate. The over 65 age cohort for Will County has an even greater growth rate of 36.3%. This is more than double the 65+ population growth rate of the State, which is 16.7%. A total population that is projected to grow by more than 3 times the State's overall population growth and an over 65 growth rate that more than doubles the State's should qualify as rapid population growth. b. Population projections shall be produced. using, as a base, the population census or estimate for the most recent year, for county, incorporated place. township or community area, by the U.S. Bureau of the Census or IDPH; 2015 DATA FROM 2017 INVENTORY PUBLISHED 09/01/2017 Market 2015 Estimated Population 2020 Estimated Population Growth 2015 Estimated 65+ Pop 2020 Estimated 65+ Pop Growth and services and Need Determinations 2017 Long.Term Care Services The above base year estimates and the projections were taken from IDPH and the 2017 IDPH Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations, Volume2, Parts VI-VII, Long-Term Care Services. Appended as ATTACHMENT-14B is the IDPH Inventory page for Will County Planning Area identified herein. ATTACHMENT-14 265 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued vii c. Projections shall be for a maximum period of 10 years from the date the application is submitted: The population increase cited is the five-year increment as required for in preparation of the State bed need calculation. d. Historical data used to calculate projections shall be for a number of years no less than the number of years projected; The need calculated is considered current need and not projected need. It should be noted that the current need for services is reflected as part of the beds needed as determined by the latest 1DPH Update to the Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations, as of January 10, 2018 for Will, Grundy, Kankakee and Kendall Counties. In these areas there is a collective need for 390 additional nursing beds through 2020. Refer to ATTACHMENT-14C for a copy of the Update to the Inventory. e. Projections shall contain documentation of population changes in terms of births, deaths and net migration for a period of time equal to or in excess of the projection horizon; The populations used to document \"rapid\" population is IDPH data that has accounted for all population changes in terms of births, deaths and net migration has been included. Projections shall be for total population and specified age groups for the applicant's market area. as defined by HFSRB, for each category of service in the application (see the HFSRB Inventory); and The census data projected in ATTACHMENT-14B provides total population and the 65+ age cohort. g. Documentation on projection methodology, data sources. assumptions and special adjustments shall be submitted to HFSRB. The methodology for the project is simply based on the census figures and the State's need calculations. The Applicant has not made any assumptions or adjustments.

Facility now has 275 Nursing Care Beds Source: Long-Term Care Facility Questionnaire for 2016, Illinois Department of Public Health, Health Systems Development https://Itc.dphillinois.gov/webapp/LTCApp/Itc.jsp As there are long-term care nursing beds and Medicare and Medicaid nursing beds within a 30-minute travel time contour as identified by the State Board Staff Report for Project #15-051, there is not an absence of the service. However, there appears to be access limitations due to payment status as not all beds in all facilities accept Medicare ATTACHMENT-17 275 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued x and Medicaid. In fact. 20.6% (1,546 beds) of the beds are not certified for Medicaid. Similarly, 14.6% (1,096 beds) are not certified for Medicare. Therefore, not all beds are equal and accessible. It should be noted that all beds being proposed will be dually Medicare and Medicaid certified. o Restrictive admission policies of existing providers: or It is a restrictive admission policy where there is a calculated need for additional beds and services regardless of existing capacity. The chart appended as ATTACHMENT-17A identifies that the utilization rate for the existing facilities within the 30-minute market contour as identified by State Board Staff Report for Project #15- 051. The peak utilization shows a reality that is much improved versus licensed capacity as peak beds set-up equates to 78.23%. A higher peak utilization rate is a restrictive policy toward admissions as it skews the appearance of available capacity by 355 beds. Specifically, the potential available nursing beds within the 30-minute market contour from the facilities identified by the State Board Staff Report for Project #15-051 (7,518 nursing beds) indicates that only 15.5% of the beds with the service area are under 90%. When evaluating the same equation for peak beds set-up there are only 11.8% under 90%. It is also important to point out that the new bed need calculation used these lower than 90% use rates and projected them forward. The resulting need is for not only the additional 274 beds, but it takes into account filling all beds under the State's target occupancy of 90% to include the Applicant's already permitted 140 beds (15-051). The four-county planning area need of 390 additional nursing beds only comes after the calculation fills to 90% the existing bed capacity. Therefore, the need for additional nursing beds in and of itself is a restrictive admissions policy. ATTACHMENT-17 276 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xi One additional characteristic of those being served is an indicator of restricted access to the general geriatric population. From the list of facilities identified by the State Board Staff Report for Project #15-051, nearly 30% (27.0%) of the existing residents in the area nursing facilities are identified as Mentally Ill. Refer to ATTACHMENT-17B. It is best practices not to co-mingle a general geriatric resident or a resident with ADRD with those with a primary diagnosis of being mentally ill (MI). A MI resident is typically younger, mobile, and more active than their geriatric counterpart. As there are differences in programming between a general geriatric resident and a memory impaired resident there are more differences for the Ml population. o The area population and existing care system exhibit indicators of medical care problems, such as an average family income level below the State average poverty level, or designation by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as a Health Professional Shortage Area, a Medically Underserved Area, or a Medically Underserved Population. This item is not germane to this project as the issue is of accessibility to services due to the overwhelming need for addition beds that are documented. 2. Additional documentation required: The applicant shall provide the following documentation, as applicable, concerning existing restrictions to service access: a. The location and utilization of other planning area service providers; Appended as ATTACHMENT-VC, is a listing of the names and locations of other planning area service providers as identified by the State Board Staff Report for Project # 15-051. A listing of the facilities and their respective utilization rates are appended as ATTACHMENT-17A. ATTACHMENT-17 277 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xii b. Patient/resident location information by zip code; The proposed project is for the establishment of service, and therefore there are no existing residents. Patient/resident location information by zip code is not applicable. c. Independent time-travel studies; In project #15-051 the State Board Staff Report identified all facilities within the 30-minute travel time. The listing, appended as ATTACHMENT-17C also indicates the individual facility travel times. d. Certification of a waiting list; As the proposed project is for the establishment of service, and as a result there are no existing residents, a wait list is not applicable. e. Admission restrictions that exist in area providers; Refer to ATTACHMENT-17D for a listing of the admission restrictions discussed above. f. An assessment of area population characteristics that document that access problems exist; Refer to ATTACHMENT-14B, is a copy of the 2017 Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations, Volume 2, Parts VI-VII, for Long-Term Care for Will County Planning Area which calculates a need for additional beds and services. As there are underutilized facilities within the Will County Planning Area, it is the increasing population that is the driving the need for beds. g.

The applicant shall provide the following information: a. A list of all zip code areas that are located, in total or in part, within 30 minutes normal travel time of the proiect's site: Appended as ATTACHMENT-18A, is a listing of all zip code areas that are located in total or in part within the 30-minute travel contour from the proposed project's site. b. The total population of the identified zip code areas (based upon the most recent population numbers available for the State of Illinois); and ATTACHMENT-18A also lists the corresponding population for the zip code areas. The census data from http://factfinder.census.gov is appended as ATTACHMENT-18B. c. The names and locations of all existing or approved LTC facilities located within 30 minutes normal travel time from the proiect site that provide the categories of bed service that are proposed by the project. A list of the names and locations of all existing and approved LTC facilities located within 30 minutes as identified by the State Board Staff Report for Project #15- 051 of the proposed project site is appended as ATTACHMENT-18C. 2. The applicant shall document that the project will not result in maldistribution of services. Misdistribution is typified by having too many facilities together within the service area where as the ratio of \"beds - to \"population - is one and one-half times greater than the ratio of the State as a whole. The primary service area is that of the Zip Code area for the Village of New Lenox. Within this area a ratio cannot be calculated as there are no nursing beds. Therefore, a maldistribution by the Board's definition will not result. Upon project completion, the New ATTACHMENT-18 284 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA continued xiu Lenox Zip Code area 60451 will have one nursing home bed for every 223.2 persons whereas the State has one nursing bed for every 141.4 people. The actual ratio of \"beds - to \"population\" for the State and the 30-minute travel contour is as follows: 7,730 (7,518 + 46 in pipeline (30-minute drive time*) + 166 proposed beds) = .006739 Population (2007) 1,147,054 (30-minute drive ti me**) Total of Nursing Care Beds 94,980 (Existing) (State of Illinois) =.0070735 * 1.5 = .010610 Population 13,427,700 Travel time as taken from Project 405-051 State Board Staff Report facilities listing. \" Zip Codes and population identified through Microsoft MapPoint 2009 (Population is 2007 estimate) The State's resultant ratio is one hundredths nursing beds to every person. The market contour's ratio is six thousandths nursing for every person, thus, it would appear that a \"maldistribution\" in accordance with the Board's definition does not exist. 3. The applicant shall document that, within 24 months after proiect completion, the proposed proiect: a. Will not lower the utilization of other area providers below the occupancy standards specified in Section 1125.210(c); and b. Will not lower, to a further extent. the utilization of other area facilities that are currently (during the latest 12-month period) operating below the occupancy standards. The Village of New Lenox does not have any beds that its growing population specifically supports. Therefore, there are no existing beds that the establishment of this facility will directly affect. Moreover, as the average use rate for the 30-minute travel time as identified by the State Board Staff Report from Project #15-051 is 78.23%, the existing use rate is already below 90%, the State's target utilization rate and item 3A above is not applicable. ATTACH MENT-18 285 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xv Item 3B above requires that the proposed project will not lower, to a further extent, the utilization of other area facilities. As stated, the primary service area of the Village, Zip Code area, Township of New Lenox does not have any nursing beds to adversely affect. On the bigger scale of the Will County Planning Area, in gross population and in the 65 and older age cohort are growing at a rate that eclipse that of the State and of the other Planning Areas where a bed need as has also been addressed with the exception of Kendall County. Refer to the chart below. 2015 Estimated 2020 Estimated 2015 Estimated 2020 Estimated Market Population Population Growth 65+ Pop 65+ Pop Growth Source: Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations 2017 Long-Term Care Services As illustrated throughout this document, the Applicant is only proposing 114 general Long-Term Care beds with the balance (52) being innovative ADRD nursing beds. Even in addressing the need for 274 additional services within the Will County Planning Area which includes the Applicant's already permitted 140 beds (15-051), the need projection also projects demand that will first fill the potentially underutilized beds (under the State's optimal rate of 90% to include the Applicant's already permitted beds). Therefore, the proposed demand will not infringe on the referrals already given to the \"other area\" facilities, to include Alden's own Alden Estates of Orland Park and Alden Estates of Shorewood both which are located within the required 30-minute market area.

Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties. Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see Accuracy of the Data). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables. For more information on understanding race and Hispanic origin data, please see the Census 2010 Brief entitled, Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010, issued March 2011. (pdf format) While the 2012-2016 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the February 2013 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas; in certain instances the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB definitions due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities. Estimates of urban and rural population, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census 2010 data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization. Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates Explanation of Symbols: 1. An '**' entry in the margin of error column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error. A statistical test is not appropriate. 2. An '-' entry in the estimate column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate, or a ratio of medians cannot be calculated because one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution. 3. An '-' following a median estimate means the median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution. 4. An '+' following a median estimate means the median falls in the upper interval of an open-ended distribution. 5. Ans*** 1 entry in the margin of error column indicates that the median falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution. A statistical test is not appropriate. 6. An '****\"' entry in the margin of error column indicates that the estimate is controlled. A statistical test for sampling variability is not appropriate. 7. An 'N' entry in the estimate and margin of error columns indicates that data for this geographic area cannot be displayed because the number of sample cases is too small. 8.

For each category of service, document that relevant clinical and professional staffing needs for the proposed project were considered and that licensure and JCAHO staffing requirements can be met. Nursing care is the only category of service applicable. 2. Provide the following documentation: a. The name and qualification of the person currently filling the position, if applicable; and b. Letters of interest from potential employees; and c. Applications filed for each position; and d. Signed contracts with the required staff; or e. A narrative explanation of how the proposed staffing will be achieved. Appended as ATTACHMENT-19A, is the proposed staffing pattern by position title for the proposed 166-bed Long-Term Care facility. This project is atypical from traditional start-up projects as the parental entity has two immediate area (within the required 30-minute travel time) facilities and one of the newest start-up facilities to draw applicants from. From these three facilities, Alden Estates of Orland Park, Alden Estates- Courts of Shorewood and Alden Estates of Huntley, in the past six months, 690 job applications have been submitted (unsolicited) for direct cate nursing staff as follows: 35 DON/RN, 18 ADON/RN, 43 RN, 88 Resident Care Coordinator RN/LPN, 20 Transitional Care Nurse RN/LPN, 56 LPN, 18 Patient Care Coordinator LPN, 245 CNA, 164 Memory Care Coordinator, and 3 Memory Care Activity Aide. Additionally, these same facilities have received 2,574 ancillary and support staff applications (unsolicited). Thus, the majority of personnel can be in place as the initial project proceeds through construction completion. Without solicitation the Applicants have more than enough of ATTACHMENT- 19 296 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xvii the required job applicants necessary to staff the facility and the project has yet to be Approved. See ATTACHMENT-198 for the full list of job applications on file by job title. To achieve adequate staffing levels, the Applicant will start by reviewing and interviewing from the employment applications currently on file. To further explain the internal process in recruiting and hiring staff a narrative description is provided below: The Applicants are related to a much larger organization that operates several general and several specialized long-term care facilities. Therefore, the Applicant and its administrative service company have the resources of general long-term care facilities throughout Illinois. This organization also has several assisted living and independent living units within Illinois. It is the policy of the organization to begin a comprehensive recruitment program for every new facility approximately four to six months prior to the opening in order to ensure that the new facility has all of the necessary positions filled with qualified personnel. Local advertising in the area newspaper and at area nursing schools has generally been sufficient in attracting the needed professional health care manpower. Furthermore, it is the policy of the organization to promote from within their company whenever possible which allows the transfer of top professionals in their field to start-up facilities. The Applicant is closely related to Alden Management Services, Inc., the administrative services company, who recruits locally, regionally, and nationally for highly qualified staff. ATTACHMENT- 19 297 SECTION IV \u2014 SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xviii Specific Staffing Achievement Plan We will utilize all available print, online, and face to face advertising to publicize the opening and available positions including but not limited to the following options: I. Post a banner ad (3x's) in the local New Lenox newspaper announcing the expected facility opening, scheduled to be posted 3-, 2-, and 1-month prior to opening. 2. Hold a day-long job fair locally to recruit and interview candidates 1-2 months prior to opening. 3. Create and add to the Alden Network website 2 individual home pages applicable to each facility listing information about construction progress, facility services and open positions including on line application capability. 4. Utilize available contracted job postings through CareerBuilder and LinkedIn. 5. Utilize available contracted recruiters for major positions search. 6 Advertise internally within our current network of facilities for staff transfers and/or promotions. 7. Signage at the job site will include contact phone number for career information. Thus, it does not appear that between the Applicant's experience and through the experience of the existing campus that there will be any difficulty in securing the needed health care manpower.

We support the project, as it will greatly enhance accessibility to skilled nursing in our area, meeting the current 274 -bed need determined by the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board. Alden Group, Ltd. currently provides health care related services to residents of the planning area within Health Service Area 9, Will County and surrounding service area including some who utilize Public Aid. It is my understanding that this facility will accept these patients. Because all facilities do not accept Public Aid or Public Aid pending patients, a facility that provides services to these patients is both necessary and welcomed. Also, we look forward to working closely with Alden as our neighbor in providing quality post acute care for the patients within our shared community of New Lenox. For these reasons, I feel that the proposed facility is needed for this location. We are familiar with member facilities of the Alden Group, Ltd. and can attest to the commitment and management ability they bring to the skilled nursing and long-term care profession.
