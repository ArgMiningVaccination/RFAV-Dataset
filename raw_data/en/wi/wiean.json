The aim was to create a place that would be both inviting and welcoming to the the clients and a place therapists would enjoy working in. The design is an integral part of the clinic, with the thought that good design determines how we use a space and how we feel in the space. I wanted this space to be a healing space, a place to escape from the hustle and stresses of life, to obtain a better balance in oneself. It a clinic that is welcome to all, TREATMENTS There are a variety of treatments/therapies currently offered at the clinic, and more are to be added soon. They are given by qualified therapists, passionate about what they do who strive to give their best. There are therapies to alleviate stress, anxiety, insomnia, tensions in the body and internal conditions. Therapies are varied but all have something unique to offer in their own way. If you are unsure about what may be the best treatment for you, call and we can discuss the options. CHINESE PROVERB \"Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are\" As a long standing client I cannot recommend Catherine's treatments highly enough. I have experienced problems with anxiety and depression for many years which manifests in chronic neck and shoulder tension and sleep problems. Over the years I have tried many alternative therapies and can honestly say that Catherine's treatments have been the most beneficial on both a physical and emotional level. Judith, Crystal Palace During treatments I feel incredibly relaxed and peaceful and afterwards continue to feel calmer and sleep much better. Recently I have stopped taking antidepressants and sleeping tablets after 9 yrs. I find Catherine a warm, caring and empathic person who puts people at ease straight away. She works in a very intuitive way and tailors each treatment to the individual's needs for that particular session. SIMON, PENGE Catherine is such a wonderful acupuncturist. She has specialist knowledge in a wide range of areas related to acupuncture and Chinese medicine - I have seen her for a combination of acupuncture, moxibustion and cupping. She really helped me understand how my issues were all connected and I have learnt so much from my treatments with her. Catherine helps you feel completely at ease with her considerate and calm demeanour, not to mention her patience when you're not the bravest with needles! She is truly a joy to be around and she genuinely cares about helping advise on all aspects of health and wellness - my health is most definitely much improved after discovering Safflower acupuncture. You are in the best possible hands with Catherine, I would wholeheartedly recommend her services! CELINE, CRYSTAL PALACE I've really enjoyed my visits to Catherine. She is a real expert when it comes to acupuncture. Everything is always very well-explained and I leave feeling a little more knowledgable about my issues after each session. I have also noticed a positive difference with my issues. I really do look forward to every appointment! CHARLOTTE, WEST NORWOOD I had a series of five acupuncture treatments from January till April. I felt that they worked deep inside and all over. I recommend Catherine as her treatments are holistic, what acupuncture should be. PIERRE, ANERLEY A great place, clinic is welcoming and warm, lovely decor. Catherine is friendly and listens, she is very knowledgeable and super helpful SCOTT, CRYSTAL PALACE Catherine is such an insightful Acupuncturist with incredible knowledge that helped me put all the pieces together. Her understanding of the meridians, her wealth of wisdom, along with her compassionate advice have helped me so much since I began seeing her for acupuncture a few months ago. I always notice an immediate improvement of my overall mood and a great lift of energy after a treatment with her. She has consistently gone out of her way to share articles and other helpful information with me. I have a wonderful understanding of the root causes to my symptoms while feeling more connected to my physical being. Thank "}
