Chiropractic care is about achieving total body fitness and therefore, it can benefit everyone. At Maple Chiropractic & Acupuncture Clinic we help people of all ages reach their optimum vitality, strength and health for a happy life. Dr. Shahverdi is a wonderful Chiropractor. Very thorough, listens, and takes his time with you. I highly recommend him!! Dr. Keyvan took the time to talk to me and find out about my foot pain and stress. I was impressed that he didn't seem to be in a hurry and get me out of there. It was my first acupuncture treatment and it was a completely a success, I am finally pain free with just one session. I was a little nervous about acupuncture, but he was very calm and professional it made me feel at ease. Really spent a lot of time getting to understand why I was there. Chiropractic / Acupuncture is a natural way to get the body to heal. I believe in getting my patients involved in their healing, in this way they are in charge of their bodies and the progress they make at each session. The more involved they are the faster they heal and the better they will feel. For sports persons it is best to visit a Chiropractor / Acupuncturist before you get an injury rather than after an injury, so your chiropractor can team up with you to keep you fit and healthy - helping ease muscular tension and stay relaxed through your season.
