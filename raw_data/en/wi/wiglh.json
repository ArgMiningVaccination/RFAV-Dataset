They did this so that our people could protect their spiritual rituals, customs, and traditions. The prophecy went like this: \"A huge wave of white people is going to come and with their coming the Indian spirit will be wiped out to almost nothing. But when it reaches its lowest point, the spirit will begin to rise up again and out of this new spirit there will be not just a red Indian but a white, black, and yellow. The beginning of this new rising will be signified by the Eagle landing on the moon.\" In 1969, when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, his first words were, \"The Eagle has landed.\" The Spirit has been rising ever since. The First Nations Health Authority's vision of holistic wellness is a part of that rising, and there is an opportunity for everyone today to play a significant role in the rising of the new spirit. The Rising Of The Spirit Leonard George, Tsleil-Waututh Nation FIRST NATIONS HEALTH AUTHORITY HEALTH CAREERS GUIDEBOOKVII Your path to a career in the health field starts with education. To get where you want to go, you'll need education. You must pursue education, because it will open many doors for you. So when should you start dedicating time and effort into making the most out of your education? Right now. Whether you're starting grade eight, in your last years of high school, or already in college, remember that every paper you write, every test you take, and every presentation you make counts. By achieving high grades at an early age, you'll create momentum that can carry over into the senior years of high school, when you are writing provincial exams and beginning to take pre-requisite or dual-credit courses that will help you to make a successful application and transition into post-secondary school. It is becoming increasingly competitive to enter many college and university programs, especially in the health field. By focusing on your goals and working hard ahead of time, you can make your educational journey smoother and more rewarding. Remember too, that many programs are becoming more accessible thanks to bridging programs, distance education, and a tremendous amount of student support at every stage. For those who have already graduated or who are currently pursuing post-secondary studies, keep in mind that receiving a diploma doesn't mean that your education is finished. Now you have the opportunity to round out your studies with experience. Education helps in getting a job, but experience helps you excel at your job. Be open to any opportunities that come your way: work experience placements, internships, volunteer opportunities, or practicums. These are opportunities to learn lessons that can't be taught in textbooks. Foreword By taking part in these opportunities you'll increase your chances of finding the permanent employment you're looking for after the position ends. And don't overlook the importance of networking early on in your career to improve your chances of landing the perfect job: one you might not have known about or been considered for otherwise. Whether you're interested in a career in the health field, or in business, technology, law, the arts or social sciences \u2014 fundamentally, the advice is the same. Whatever the field, whatever your goals, focus on getting an education that will prepare you for success, and remember to stay curious, open-minded, and alive to all the opportunities that will come your way. No matter where you live or what your specific career goals are, the health field for BC First Nations and Aboriginal People is at a unique moment in history. First Nations and Aboriginal People are changing their health system from a system of reaction to one of prevention, from a sickness system to a wellness system. This system is in a state of constant change and the evolution of the First Nations Health Authority is just one reflection of that. Now is the time to be part of the transformation. As Kukpi7 Wayne Christian has often quoted, \"We are the ones we are waiting for.\" Right now, people just like all of you across BC are reading this book, dreaming about your futures, and planning how you will be involved in making the vision of \"Healthy, Self-Determining, and Vibrant BC First Nations Children, Families, and Communities\" a reality. Help to make that vision come true, and drive the change that is underway for First Nations and Aboriginal people. Find your career opportunity in the exciting, diverse, and challenging field of health.

You'll Change Lives Working in the health field gives you the unique opportunity to make positive changes in the lives of others. There's no other career path that can give you the ability to save, change, and improve lives from birth to death (and everywhere in between). No matter what area of health you choose to focus in, whether it's dental care, vision care, information technology, public health, or policy and administration, you'll know that you're making a real contribution to people's wellbeing. And you'll work with others who share your passion to help people. 2. You'll Find Diversity, Variety and Opportunity Want to pursue a PhD? Or are you looking for a job that you can start right out of high school? Hundreds of different jobs in the health field means that there are opportunities for everyone, regardless of their level of education, or their particular skills and interests. Do you enjoy working with the public? Or maybe you'd be more interested working in a laboratory setting, or with computers? Whether your ideal job involves working with children, using technology, spending time outdoors, or crunching numbers, there's a career in health to match your expectations. The field of health is so diverse, and there are lots of opportunities for growth and change throughout your career. You may choose to stay in the same job for three months, three years or for three decades \u2014 the choice is yours! \"There is a pool of incredible dynamism and passion within the Aboriginal community of young people... who are breaking new ground. The trend is to be strong in the modern world skills and knowledge while deeply rooted in the traditional world with its incredible beliefs, teachings and practices.\" \u2014 Grand Chief Ed John, Tl'azt'en Nation 3. It's Growing... and Fast Here in BC, as in the rest of Canada, the population is aging. Baby boomers are starting to retire \u2014 creating job openings \u2014 and they're also requiring and utilizing more health care services as they age \u2014 creating increased demand. And as people are living longer than ever before, that demand will only continue to grow. Meanwhile, we have a baby boom happening! Our Aboriginal and First Nations population is the fastest growing demographic in the province, and with an average age in the mid-20s, our communities are growing by leaps and bounds. It all means there's no better time than right now for Aboriginal and BC First Nations youth to find their way into a meaningful career within the health field. We need you! 4. You'll Enjoy Competitive Pay and Benefits Many of the opportunities within the health field in our province offer excellent pay along with medical, dental and extended health care benefits. These employers may also offer opportunities for professional development and progressive pay scales for continued service, as well as attractive pension plans. Health professionals who decide to enter private practice or who find employment with businesses or non-profit organizations will have more variable earnings, but with the high demand for many types of health professionals, wages are expected to remain very competitive across the field. FIRST NATIONS HEALTH AUTHORITY HEALTH CAREERS GUIDEBOOKIX 5. Your Community Needs You If you're not already convinced that health is the right path for you, consider this: you can make a real, lasting contribution to the well-being of the people in your local community through your health career. For many First Nations and Aboriginal youth who come from rural or remote communities, health care is a great way to give back to their home community. There's a shortage of health care workers in many areas of the province, and there's a shortage of First Nations and Aboriginal health providers. You can change that. As our understanding and recognition of the holistic nature of health increases across the health system, we're beginning again to value the importance of our diverse cultures and the role they play in the overall health and wellness of our communities, equally as important as utilizing modern technology to advance our health outcomes. Aboriginal health providers bring an inherent cultural understanding to their work in their communities. Aboriginal youth bring gifts, skills, and abilities that are in high demand in our communities, and the province. Of course there are other incentives for working in rural and remote communities, including BC Student Loan Forgiveness programs and other financial benefits. Not to mention there is a tremendous amount of value in working in close-knit communities and building lasting relationships with the people you work with and for. Choose a Health Career Today As a First Nations or Aboriginal person, you've got a monumental opportunity to build an exciting career in the health field. Your skills and education are highly sought after. So take the time to consider your options and choose a career path that fits your abilities and interests. As you read about the careers profiled in this guide, remember that the field of health is constantly changing: new jobs are emerging, new skills are always needed. Health is filled with OPPORTUNITY. XFIRST NATIONS HEALTH AUTHORITY HEALTH CAREERS GUIDEBOOK How To Use This Guide Projections for British Columbia's labour market show that, over the next decade, there will be approximately 1 million job openings in the province. Of those, 78 percent will require post-secondary education, 35 percent will call for a university degree, 28 percent will require a two-year college credential, and 15 percent a trades credential. \u2014 Business Council of BCIn this guidebook you'll find profiles of a wide variety of health careers. These profiles are meant to give you an idea of the diversity of careers available to you in the health field \u2014 everything from Psychiatrist to Podiatrist. Some of the careers will be familiar to you, while others may be quite new. Consider this guide a starting point for your research \u2014 there are many more careers and much more information out there than it was possible to include in these pages. Each job description in this guide follows the same format. Fast Facts EarningsThe dollar signs represent the approximate range of earnings for each career.$=$25,000 or less per year $$ =$25,001 to $50,000 to $100,000 year $$$$$ =$100,001 or more per year Job OutlookAre there many future career opportunities projected for this field? In general, careers in the health field in BC are growing rapidly. The job outlook figures indicate the level of annual growth predicted for different occupations. =High Job Growth (2.0%+ expected annual growth in employment demand 2014-2024) =Job Growth (1.1 - 2.0% expected annual growth in employment demand 2014-2024) = Limited Job Growth (0.1 - 1.0% expected annual growth in employment demand 2014-2024) = Stable (0% expected annual growth in employment demand 2014-2024) Figures based on data from WorkBC. Years in SchoolWith the exception of a small handful of direct-to-work careers (e.g. paramedic), which still require training and certification, almost every career listed in this guidebook requires some post-secondary training or education. Some careers may require an undergraduate university degree followed by a professional or graduate program. Years in School indicates the length of time in postsecondary programs required to qualify for each career. Check the Education & Training section in each job description for more details on the program of study required. In Demand, In Community Some careers in the health field are anticipated to have increased demand in the coming years \u2014 either because of a shortage of trained professionals, or because of changing health needs as the population ages. This is especially true in many of our First Nations communities. Look for the In Demand symbol on career description pages in these categories: Nursing and Nursing Support (Nurse Practitioner, Registered Nurse, Licensed Practical Nurse) Mental Health, Addictions & Community Services (Registered Psychologist, Counsellor, Social Worker) Health Administration (Medical Office Assistant) Physicians & Related Careers (General Practitioner) Pharmacy (Pharmacist) Oral Health (Dentist, Dental Hygienist, Certified Dental Assistant) Public Health (Environmental Health Officer) Maternal & Child Health (Midwife) FIRST NATIONS HEALTH AUTHORITY HEALTH CAREERS GUIDEBOOKXI Choosing A Health Career That's Right For You Your skills and abilities are in demand! That's right \u2014 businesses, organizations, and communities all across BC are looking for young people just like you who can bring new energy, ideas and innovations into the health field. Here's what you have, that they want: An aptitude for technology: As smart phones keep getting smarter, organizations need individuals who understand and can keep up with rapidly evolving technologies \u2014 and who can drive the evolution. The ability to adapt quickly: Today's work environment is changing rapidly, and within the health field new roles and responsibilities are constantly emerging as our knowledge continues to grow. Creativity: You've got new ways of thinking, new ways of processing information. That kind of thinking leads you to new ideas that can drive innovation and change the way health services are delivered or developed. Organizations need your thinking and your ideas.Cultural Safety and Awareness: Many First Nations and Aboriginal people have grown up with cultural values as an important part of everyday life. An understanding and respect for the culture of the people you are serving plays an important part in providing the best level of care possible. Today's Aboriginal and First Nations youth have inherent skills in cross-cultural communication. Thanks to their cultural competency, they recognize culturally safe care \u2014 and that's something that is hard to teach.Motivation: You've got the drive to turn your dreams into reality! These skills, and others that you may not even have thought of yet, can help you to succeed in the health careers outlined in this guide. Every health career demands a slightly different set of skills, abilities, and personality traits. To succeed in almost all health careers you'll need empathy, good communications skills, some level of technical or mathematical ability, and a willingness to work hard and to continue learning throughout your career. The field of health is always changing as new technologies and treatments are developed. Some of the jobs profiled in this guide didn't exist ten or even five years ago. Keep in mind that some careers in the health field don't require a health education background! For example, if you have training and experience in science, business, communications, technology, sociology, or education, your skills and knowledge can translate easily into various important roles under the health umbrella. Planners, administrators, policy analysts, researchers, web developers, media relations experts, educators and leaders are all needed in order to ensure that the health field continues to grow. Your unique skills and background can make a huge contribution to the health of First Nations and Aboriginal communities in BC. Moving On Up Choosing the career that is right for you is an important decision. Training for many of the careers you'll read about in this guide will require a significant investment of your time and effort, so you should think carefully about the type of career that best suits you. But keep in mind that the skills and abilities required for a career in health can easily translate into many other career options. There will be many opportunities for you move into new positions and to change career paths in the years ahead. Here are some tips and things to think about as you make your decision: Step 1: Identify Your Skills and Interests There are some people who seem to have been born knowing what they were meant to do in this world \u2014 people who have always intended to be doctors, or actors, or fire fighters, and who pursue their dreams with passion. And for some of us, deciding what we want to \"be\" isn't so easy. XIIFIRST NATIONS HEALTH AUTHORITY HEALTH CAREERS GUIDEBOOK Thinking about your skills and interests is a great first step towards choosing the career that will suit you best. Check out the following list of skills needed for a number of health careers, and read about the selected career examples. Do they sound like a good fit for you?

Fortunately, there are many other resources for more detailed information on health careers and programs of study. Start with the schools and associations that are listed in each health career description, and at the back of this guide. You may want to contact a health professional working in the field you are interested in, or discuss your choice with a teacher or program advisor at a college or university. Ask about the admission requirements, the cost of tuition, the type of instruction and hours of study expected, and whether the school or program assists students with job placements. In addition, most BC universities and colleges offer advice, and in some cases, specific programs or reserved seats for BC First Nations and Aboriginal students. Check out the following section on Aboriginal Pre-Health Programs, or see the list of schools at the back of this guide for more information. Career Laddering Don't want to spend years in school training for a career, but you're still ambitious and want to succeed in your chosen field? You're in luck! More and more employers in the health field are investing in career-laddering frameworks for their employees. A career ladder is a series of connected skills and education training programs that can help you to advance in the field of your choice. Career ladders help workers move up to more challenging (and more well-paid) positions after they enter employment. Here's an example of how career laddering can work:Here are some other things to think about as you plan your future career goals: Do you enjoy helping others? Do you like solving problems?Are you a good team player?Do you handle pressure well?Are you flexible and able to think quickly?

But the field of health also includes a number of careers that focus on helping people to maintain wellness and improve their health and quality of life through what are called complementary and alternative practices \u2014 such as reflexology, acupuncture, or herbalism. This group of diverse medical and health care practices are not generally considered part of conventional Western medicine. Alternative and complementary health practitioners take a holistic approach to client care; they view and treat the client as a whole person, rather than focusing on particular symptoms. This field of health tends to be strongly prevention oriented, utilizing low-tech, \"hands-on\" techniques that are intended to strengthen the body's natural ability to heal itself.

Starting down this path hasn't meant that there is an obligation to remain on it. But I've stayed because it has challenged me and presented puzzles that have their solutions as rewarding moments. My introduction to IT was in the hustle and bustle of a call centre: I answered technical questions from customers, helped them with using their equipment or software, and problem solved their issues.

During high school I had some friends and cousins who had babies and I saw that they could use a lot of extra support and gentleness. Entering university I thought I would go into social services to work with young parents. In that time I learned about the health of our communities, and about global health. I also had the honour of assisting my auntie at the birth of my niece, a homebirth with midwives. I saw how powerful and vulnerable she was, and I felt drawn to work in women's health, in order to protect women, and to protect the honour and importance of bearing life. I learned the Anishinaabe teachings of womanhood and I met traditional midwives. When I decided to enter the Midwifery profession I was already enrolled in a BA program at McMaster University. I applied for admission to the Ryerson University Midwifery Education Program. I had to go back and take a high school biology class in summer school, which felt a bit silly at the time, but was well worth it. I never dreamed in high school that I was going to go into the health sciences! I love what I do. It's this amazing privilege we have as midwives to be invited into the most intimate and important time in a family's life. It's so neat to watch the family evolve over time, and I am happy to be carrying on a tradition. I believe being treated respectfully and gently during this time and welcoming that baby in a good way is important for the health of the whole community, young and old. Midwives look after women in pregnancy, during the labour and birth, and during the first six weeks after the baby is born. So my day usually involves a combination of prenatal visits, maybe a birth, and some mom and baby care. I do visits in a clinic and in home, and I also work at the hospital. I volunteer at the elementary school and I often participate in prenatal groups or I may go speak to a youth group. I would love to see each community being served by midwives from their own community, and to make Midwifery education and training closer to home for everyone. I would love if the whole lifecycle of care was available to our communities, so everyone could be supported by loved ones during birth, and also at the end of life. Too many families are separated at these important times.
