Here Are 3 Ways To Prevent That ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/22/medicare-drug-prices-negotiation-innovation/) Giving billions of dollars in government prize money to drug companies might sound like an idea from the pharmaceutical industry. In fact, it was a sweeping 2013 proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) using \"innovation prizes\" to put the cures of tomorrow and affordability of drugs today on equal footing.

While a good step, it is unlikely to make a significant difference in how much seniors pay overall for medicine. (Simon F.

[ MSNBC: Democrats Need To Ignore History And Rally Latinos To Vote For Abortion Rights ](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrats-need-ignore-history-rally-latinos-vote-abortion-rights-n1298155) Before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer, polls historically showed that Latinos in the United States were generally opposed to abortion. That opposition might be waning, if findings from a recent comprehensive poll of Latino voters are any indication. In a UnidosUS/Mi Familia Vota survey of 2,750 eligible Latino voters released Aug. 10, 76% of respondents agreed with the following statement: \"No matter what my personal beliefs about abortion are, I think it is wrong to make abortion illegal and take that choice away from everyone else.\" (Julio Ricardo Varela, 8/23) [ Stat: The U.S. Is At A Crossroads For Reducing Tobacco-Related Harms ](https://www.statnews.com/2022/08/24/crossroads-us-reducing-tobacco-related-disease-death/) Although cigarette smoking has steadily declined over the past several decades, thanks to a more educated and health-conscious society, new and existing combustible and noncombustible tobacco products continue to pose public health challenges.

The latest legislative attack on the health care community, made possible by the Supreme Court's abandonment of stare decisis with the recent Dobbs decision, will affect the primary care of Tennesseans -even those who are not women seeking reproductive freedom.

But this narrow focus on fundraising and aid limits the public good that comes from investing in child health. (Shiza Abbasi and Carrie B.

Here's Why My Kids Won't Wear Masks This School Year ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/23/my-kids-wont-wear-masks-school/) For the first year of the coronavirus pandemic, my family and I were extremely cautious. I gave birth in April 2020, shortly after covid-19 hit. To protect the baby, my husband and I pulled our then-2-year-old son out of preschool. We socialized outdoors only, at a safe distance from others. I limited indoor activities to work and grocery shopping, and I was never without my N95. (Leana S. Wen, 8/23) [ The Star Tribune: 'High Plateau' For COVID As Fall Nears ](https://www.startribune.com/high-plateau-for-covid-as-fall-nears/600200635/) Nationally, close to 400 people a day on average succumb to the still-circulating, still-evolving virus, according the COVID tracker maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The daily average of new hospital admissions is above 5,000.

He is hero and tormentor. Truth-teller and unreliable narrator. He has borne our angst. And through it all, he's shown the public nothing but patience and decency \u2014 and only the occasional flares of angry exasperation mostly reserved for a senator named Rand Paul (R-Ky.) whose preferred response to the pandemic might be summed up as "}
