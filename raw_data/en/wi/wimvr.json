The total recommended state budget for fiscal year 2020-2021 is $40.8 billion, with $ 20.1 billion from state appropriati ons; $14.6 billion from federal funds ; $4.1 billion from other departmental revenues ; $1.9 billion from higher education student tuition and fees ; and $124 million in bonds. This is a n increase of $1.5 billion in total funding and a n increase of $ 1.1 bill ion in state funding from the revised current fiscal year 2019-2020 spending estimates . Federal revenue is increasing by $322.2 million, departmental revenue is increasing by $11 million, and capital and highway construction bonds remain the same, as does higher education student tuition and fees. Mid-year review of state tax collections and advice from economists and the State Funding Board suggest that current -year estimates of taxes collected by the Department of Revenue show healthy growth . The revis ed recurring current -year growth rate in the general fund is 3.75 percent compared with the actual 2018-2019 Department of Revenue collections. For fiscal year 2020-2021, before inter -fund reallocations, general fund taxes are expected to grow by $408.3 million above the revised current -year estimate. This is a 3.1 percent general fund growth rate above the revised current -year estimate. Revenue growth rates are within the range of revenue growth recommended by the State Funding Board. The revised revenue estimates for the current year and estimates for next year are based on a steady economic growth through fiscal year 2020-2021 and beyond. Tax Reductions The Governor's Recommended Budget includes a 50 percent reduction in the professional privilege tax, reducing it from $400 per license per year to $200 per license per year. The resulting loss of $40 million in state revenue is accounted for in this budget recommendation. The professional privilege tax was introduced in 1992 at $200 annually assess ed to 22 professions. In 2002, the tax was increased to $400. In 2019, the tax was reduced in scope to impact four professions. Efficiencies Recognized The fiscal year 20 20-2021 budget process began with asking state agencies to review their current operations and determine if services could be delivered in a more efficient and less costly xix xix State of Tennessee Budget Highlights Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 20 20-2021 The fiscal year 2020 -2021 budget consists of strong revenues from an economy favorable to families and businesses in Tennessee, reductions in taxes, efficiencies recognized from a review of current state agency operations, the use of existing state positions to take on new responsibilities, and strategic investments that focus resources on new efforts to improve the lives of Tennesseans.

Also, state positions that had been vacant for more than three years were repurposed by those agencies requesting additional positions for new programs to keep the overall number of positions to a more appropriate level. The result was a recurring general fund reduction of $91.5 million. The average general fund executive branch reduction is 1.8 percent. A total of 191 positions will be reduced as a result of reductions and repurposing. (The reductions are detailed in Volume 2: Base Budget Reductions .) Investments in Education and Workforce Development For K -12 education, the cost to maintain full funding of the Basic Education Program (BEP) formula, which provides an equitable state share of K -12 public education funding to L ocal Education A gencies (LEAs) , is $65.9 million . To further support teachers and students, the a dministration recommends a n appropriation of $117.4 million in salary increases fo r teachers and other positions funded through the BEP formula , effective July 1, 2020. The amount of the salary increases will depend on each LEA's salary schedule and structure, but if applied across -the- board, this would be a 4 percent salary increase. Programs to improve literacy rates are improved with new appropriations totaling $70.6 million. Of that amount, $11.3 million recurring and $37.5 million non- recurring are for a statewide literacy initiative that emphasizes intensive training and coachin g of elementary school teachers; $20 million non- recurring for the acquisition of high quality instructional materials for third through eighth grade students, and $1.8 million non- recurring for the second year of a three- year literacy coaching initiative. Leadership and professional development programs are funded with an appropriation of $46.7 million. These programs include the Teacher and Leader Institute ($5 million recurring and $20 million non -recurring); the Governor's Fellowship Initiative ($8.5 million recurring ); Local Teacher Development or Grow -Your- Own ($319,200 recurring and $5 million non -recurring); Educator and Leader Preparation Program ( $3 million non- recurring); School Leaders Pathways ($200,000 Development ($500,000 non- recurring); and Advance Placement Course for Teaching ($150,000 recurring). To strengthen and promote student choice, $12 million recurring and $12 million non -recurring is recommended for the Charter Schools Facilities fund to assist public charter schools in acquiring and improving property. Education Savings Accounts are funded with a recurring $2.3 million appropriation and $12.9 million non- recurring . Achievement S chool Districts will receive $25 million recurring for support services. To transfer responsibilities from the Board of Education to the Charter School Commission, $250,000 non- recurring is recommended. The total amount of new funding requested for K-12 education is $399 million. Budget Highlights A general fund recurring recommendation of $38 million fully funds the outcome funding formula for the University of Tennessee system ($11.1 million), Locally Governed Institutions ($14.7 million), and the Board of Regents ($12.2 million). These funds may be used for program improvements that assist the institutions in meeting outcomes such as student progression, degree production, research and service, efficiency metrics, and other outcome measures related to institutional mission. A 2.5 percent salary pool for higher education employees is funded with a recurring $8.1 million for the University of Tennessee, $12.1 million for the Locally Governed Institutions and $8.2 million for the Board of Regents. A 2. 5 percent salary pool for employees working in non- formula units of higher education is funded with $425,800 to the Higher Education Commission, $8.2 million for the University of Tennessee, $1.9 million for the Locally Governed Institutions and $419,500 for the Board of Regents. Total new funding for higher education salaries equals $39.3 million. Recurring funding of $9.6 million is recommended for need- based financial aid to serve eligible students through the Tennessee Student Assistance Awards (TSAA) program. This program provides grants to financially needy undergraduate students who are residents of Tennessee and who are attending in- state institutions. This additional investment will expand the students served to those with an expected family contribution of up to $3,000, equivalent to an adjusted gross income of approximately $44,000 for a family of four. Security upgrades at various campuses are funded with $2 million non-recurring and a recurring $5 million for T ennessee C olleges of Applied Technology safety and security. Maintenance needs are addressed with $10 million recurring for the University of Tennessee, Board of Regents, and Locally Governed Institutions. The total amount of new funding requested for higher education is $139.3 million. Investment s in Health and Social Services An additional $90.8 million in recurring state funding is recommended for the TennCare program to offset increased costs due to a 3.49 percent medical inflation and utilization rate increase. An appropriation of $35.6 mill ion will add 2,400 enrollees in the Employment and Community First (ECF) CHOICES program. Of those enrollees, 300 will be individuals in crisis, 100 individuals who have severe behavioral health and psychiatric conditions, and 2,000 enrollees will be from the waiting list. Postpartum coverage for women will be extended from 60 days to 12 months under a pilot program with a non- recurring recommendation of $6.6 million. Pregnant and postpartum women will also receive extended dental benefits with $2 millio n recurring. xxi xxi Budget Highlights manner.

The next section of the B udget Document, entitled \"Budget Overview,\" is a brief summary of the total budget. This overview is a series of charts and schedules that summarize the budget. The total state budget and the general fund budget are represented by pie charts that detail each major tax and each func tional area for the recommended budget. Tennessee's current taxstructure has the m ajority of its tax revenue coming from the sales tax, the largest portion of which funds K -12 educ ation. The over view schedules clarify and detail the expenditures, revenue sources, and personnel requirements of state government. The Budget Document has several total budget schedules comparing pr ograms by funding source and showing how those funds are derived. Also i ncluded are tables that list, by department, the cost increases proposed for the next fiscal year. A separate table lists, by department, proposed base budget reductions, indicating the percent age of reduction compared with general fund state appropriatio ns and with so- called discretionary appropriations. The discretionary appropriations exclude appropriations from all dedicated taxes and fees, federal aid, and other departmental revenue; and general fund appropriations for the K -12 Basic Education Progra m (BEP), pre -kindergarten, constitutionally and statutorily required salaries of judges, 31 district attorneys general,xxx xxxThe Budget Document 31 public defenders, and certain programs affecting indigent or low -income persons. There are two charts that provide the total fund ba lance available, indicating the appropriation requirements and the general fund and education fund revenues and reserves available to meet that need: \"General Fund and Education Fund, Comparison of Appropriation Requirements and State Revenues\" for the current year ,and next (or recommended budget) year. The two charts show how the budget is balanced against general fund and education fund tax revenues for the two fiscal years. Because of its dedicated funding sources, the Department of Transportation's appropriation requirements and revenue sources are stated on a separate chart. All agencies and departments are i ncluded in the summary comparison schedules by program and funding source. Other schedules provide detail on the supplemental appropriations r equired to maintain programs in the current fiscal year, the Constitutional spending limitation requirement, a su mmary of personnel and funding for all state agencies and higher education instit utions, and Tennessee characteristics, which include demographic and other information on the state. Charts in the overview summarize base budget reductions and base budget adjustments (increases). The charts reflect changes from the current -year work program recurring state appropriations. The overview also include s charts summarizing the lottery for education revenue estimates, program requirements funded from the lottery revenue, and lottery reserve fund balances. The section entitled \"State Tax Rev enues\" presents state tax revenue estimates for the ensuing fiscal year, compared with actual collections for the previous year and the revised estimate for the current year. This section explains the various sources of revenue, by collecting agency, and the statutory appo rtionment among the various funds: the general fund, education fund, highway fund, sinking (or debt service) fund, and cities and counties fund. Included in the \"Financial Statements\" section are the comparative balance sheets for the general fund, education fund, and high way fund. This s ection is follo wed by the expenditures and requirements of the debt service fund for the previous, current, and subse quent fiscal years. A debt service fund comparative balance sheet also is included. The status of the various authorized and unissued bonds is given in a schedule of bonds and appropriations made for capital purposes in lieu of bond issuance. The statement of bonded indebtedness pre sents the retirement schedule for the state's bonded debt. The cost of outstanding bonds is reflected as principal and intere st. The proposed capital outlay for the ensuing fiscal year is included within the \"Capital Outlay and Facilities Program\" section. Specific projects are shown for each department impacted, along with capital maintenance. Whether from current funds of the general fund, the sale of general obligation bonds, or from other sources, the proposed funding for each project is indicated. All of the summary charts and program statements in this Budget Document include appropriations from all state sources, both general taxes and dedicated taxes and fees. The major portion of the Budget Document is \"Program Statements by Func tional Area.\" For presentation in the Budget Document, departments and agencies with related missions, programs, goals, and objectives are gr ouped, resulting in six functional areas. This enables legislators, policy -makers, and citizens to have a be tter concept of the magnitude and costs of services provided through the various funct ional areas of state government. At the beginning of each functional area presentation is an introduction to the The Budget Document associated agencies ;followed by tables that show the total expenditures, funding sources, and personnel of each functional area ;and a list of cost increases that are recommended for that area of state g overnment The activities and responsibilities of the departments and agencies are explained through narrative descriptions of each program. Following this narrative, fiscal and personnel data are provided for the last completed year, the current year, and the next year. The next -year estimates include the level of funding and number of positions for the recommended base budget, program cost increases , and the total recommended. Base budget reductions necessary to balance general fund appropriations are included in the recommended base budget of this document by program. The specific base reductions by program are itemized in a separate Volume 2, Base Budget Reduc tions. Following the \"Program Statements by Functional Area,\" the next -to-last section of the Budget Document is \"Budget Process.\" This section includes explanatory sections entitled \"The Budget Process,\" and \" Basis of Budgeting and Accounting.\" The final section is the \"Glossary and Index.\"xxxi xxxi The Budget Document 31 public defenders, and certain programs affecting indigent or low -income persons.

In the TennCare program, an upward trend in federal funding from fiscal years 2015-2016 to 2018-2019 is continued in fiscal years 201 9-2020 and 2020-2021. The increases in 2019- 2020 and 2020-2021 are largely du e to medical inflation and utilization in the program, continued implementation of information system s, and increased utilization of a waiver for intellectually and developmentally disabled enrollees. The impacts to the TennCare budget are displayed elsewhere in this budget. Significant Federal Funding Program Actions - 2009 to 2020 In February 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). From state fiscal year 2008 -2009 to 2013-2014, ARRA awarded over $6 billion to the State of Tennessee. The funds awarded included enhanced Medicaid matching funds, grants to Local Education Agencies, increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Food Stamps) benefits, special educatio n grants, and infrastructure grants for highways and bridges. Also, the State of Tennessee applied for and won a $500 million multi -year grant in 2010 to improve educational outcomes as a part of the Race to the Top program outlined in ARRA. This funding was fully obligated by June 30, 2014. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was designed to provide for an increase in the federal debt limit while reducing long -term budget deficits. Most significantly for the states, the act established spending caps on discretionary spending programs through federal fiscal year 2021 and included a utomatic procedures to reduce spending over a 10- year period by over $1.2 trillion. The automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, were triggered on January 2, 2013 and effective March 1, 2013. As a result, 242 state-administered federal programs in Tennessee were reduced $71.8 million for fiscal year 2013-2014. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the discretionary program spending caps in federal fiscal years 2020 and 20 21, while also extending the imposition of sequestration spending caps beyond 2021 to federal fiscal year 202 9. As a result, there are no additional sequestration reductions of federally funded programs in state fiscal years 201 9-2020 or 2020-2021. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, was passed by Congress in December 2019 to fund the federal government until September 30, 2020. The spending caps in th is law are subject to the discretionary program spending caps first described in the Budget Control Act of 2011 and amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019. Fiscal Year 2021 Outlook For fiscal year 20 20-2021, increased f ederal aid is recommended largely in the TennCare program. Of the total cost increas e from federal sources of $ 417,653,200 , the share directed to the TennCare program is $399,937,500. A factor increasing the federal aid estimate in both the TennCare and Department of Children's Services budgets is the addition of federal funds due to a n increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The FMAP is the rate at which the federal government matches state appropriation expenditures in the programs. The FMAP formula measures a state's personal income relative to the nation. The revised FMAP in creased fiscal year 20 20-2021 federal funding by $45,686,300 in TennCare and the Department of Children's Services. State appropriations reductions are recommended to offset this increase in federal funds. State of Tennessee Tennessee Economic Overview Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2020-2021 Tennessee's fiscal environment depends on economic conditions that influence both the expenditure and revenue sides of the state budget. The Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee prepared this summary of current eco nomic conditions and expectations for short -term economic growth in Tennessee and the nation. For additional information, see the most recent edition of \"An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee.\" The economy's long economic expansion that began in the summer of 2009 has now set a record for its longevity. While growth has shown signs of slowing, the economic expansion taking place in Tennessee and across the country continues unabated. The labor market continues to be a bright spot, with the state unemployment rate standing at a remarkably low 3.3 percent in November, 2019, compared to a slightly higher 3.5 percent rate for the nation in the same month. Tennessee enjoyed nonfarm job growth of 1.6 percent in 2019, in line with the na tion's pace of job creation. However, r ecent data suggest that improvements in the labor market are slowing. The pace of overall job growth is slowing, and the nation is seeing signs of a weakening manufacturing sector. Fortunately, the state's manufactu ring is still showing signs of growth. The state and national economies are expected to continue to grow through 2020 and 2021. But growth is likely to slow further, largely because of labor market constraints which will limit the number of new entrant s to the labor market. The discussion that follows provides additional background on current economic conditions and the economic outlook for the state and nation to help frame the state's fiscal outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. For more information on the economic outlook for the U.S . and Tennessee, see \" An Annual Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee. \" Recent Economic Conditions U.S. inflation -adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) was up 2.3 percent in 2019, which is down from the 2.9 percent rate of growth recorded in 2018. Growth in nonresidential fixed investment matched GDP growth in 2019. Unfortunately, the pace of investment growth has slowed appreciably from the 6.4 percent rate of growth in 2018. The slowdown is attributable t o the waning influence of federal tax cuts and diminished need for additional business capacity as overall growth slows. Consumer spending was up 3.0 percent last year with very strong growth in durable goods spending. Residential investment was a drag o n growth in 2019, slipping 1.7 percent on the heels of a 1.5 percent setback in 2018. Inflation remains muted, with the Consumer Price Index showing an increase of just 1.8 percent. The labor market remains vibrant, at least in metropolitan areas. Payro ll employment grew 1.6 percent in 2019, down slightly from the 1.7 percent gain in the previous year. The unemployment rate averaged 3.7 percent for the year. Rural places across the country have seen much weaker growth and labor markets are strained by job losses and relatively high unemployment rates. The Tennessee economy has seen sustained growth, building on the momentum set by the national economy. Inflation- adjusted GDP grew 2.7 percent in 2019, well ahead of the nation's 2.3 percent gain. Personal income \u2014 which accounts for all income earned by Tennesseans from all sources \u2014also outpaced national growth. Like the nation, the labor market is a bright spot of the economy, with record -low unemployment rates. Nonfarm A-47 From fiscal years 2015-2016 to non- fund collecti ons were between $5.4 and $5.7 billion, with estimated funding in fiscal years 201 9-2020 and 2020 -2021 above fiscal year 2018-2019 actual levels. In the TennCare program, an upward trend in federal funding from fiscal years 2015-2016 to 2018-2019 is continued in fiscal years 201 9-2020 and 2020-2021. The increases in 2019- 2020 and 2020-2021 are largely du e to medical inflation and utilization in the program, continued implementation of information system s, and increased utilization of a waiver for intellectually and developmentally disabled enrollees.

For more information on the economic outlook for the U.S . and Tennessee, see \" An Annual Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee. \" Recent Economic Conditions U.S. inflation -adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) was up 2.3 percent in 2019, which is down from the 2.9 percent rate of growth recorded in 2018. Growth in nonresidential fixed investment matched GDP growth in 2019. Unfortunately, the pace of investment growth has slowed appreciably from the 6.4 percent rate of growth in 2018. The slowdown is attributable t o the waning influence of federal tax cuts and diminished need for additional business capacity as overall growth slows. Consumer spending was up 3.0 percent last year with very strong growth in durable goods spending. Residential investment was a drag o n growth in 2019, slipping 1.7 percent on the heels of a 1.5 percent setback in 2018. Inflation remains muted, with the Consumer Price Index showing an increase of just 1.8 percent. The labor market remains vibrant, at least in metropolitan areas. Payro ll employment grew 1.6 percent in 2019, down slightly from the 1.7 percent gain in the previous year. The unemployment rate averaged 3.7 percent for the year. Rural places across the country have seen much weaker growth and labor markets are strained by job losses and relatively high unemployment rates. The Tennessee economy has seen sustained growth, building on the momentum set by the national economy. Inflation- adjusted GDP grew 2.7 percent in 2019, well ahead of the nation's 2.3 percent gain. Personal income \u2014 which accounts for all income earned by Tennesseans from all sources \u2014also outpaced national growth. Like the nation, the labor market is a bright spot of the economy, with record -low unemployment rates. Nonfarm A-48 jobs were up 1.6 percent for the year and the state's manufacturing sector saw exceptionally strong growth of 2.1 percent, almost twice the rate of growth of the nation's manufacturing sector. Similar to the national pattern, rural communities across the state continue to struggle with job losses and elevated unemployment rates. Short -Term Economic Outlook Slower economic growth is on the horizon for both the state and national economies. At the same time, there is no expectation of a recession . No major sectors of the econ omy are currently subject to high risk. However, recessions are typically caused by an unanticipated shock and such a shock is always possible. Weak gains in productivity, along with slowing growth in the number of new entrants to the labor market, will together contribute to a slower growth path for the state and the nation. Ongoing tariff wars will also hold back overall economic growth. U.S. inflation- adjusted GDP is expected to be up 2.1 percent in 2020, with growth slowing slightly to 2.0 percent in 2021. Nonfarm employment growth will slow to just 1.2 percent this year and 0.8 percent next year. After bottoming out at 3.4 percent in 2020, the nation's unemployment rate will drift up to 3.5 percent in 2021. Consumer spending will continue to be the major driver for the economy. Interest rates will begin inching higher but not until 2021. Inflation will continue to see modest growth. Tennessee's inflation -adjusted GDP will see slower growth of 2.1 percent this year, in line with output gr owth for the national economy. Growth will weaken further in 2021. Tennessee's n ominal personal income will be up 4.6 percent in 2020 and 4.7 percent in 2021. Slower income growth will be attributable in part to slower job growth and thus payroll growth. For fiscal year 2020 - 2021, personal income is expected to be up 4.5 percent. Tennessee n onfarm employment will be up 0.9 percent this year, with job growth slowing to just 0.5 percent in 2021. The state will see weak growth in manufacturing employment in 2020, with job losses anticipated in 2021. The state unemployment rate will remain well below 4 percent for the foreseeable future.

A- 108 State of Tennessee State Tax Revenues Introduction Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 20 20-2021 The revenues necessary to finance state government are collected from a variety of sources. The primary source of funding for state expenditures is appropriation from general revenues. General revenues are proceeds from taxes, licenses, fees, fines, forfeitures, and other imposts laid specifically by law. The revenue estimating process generally starts twelve months before a fiscal year begins. Revenue collections are tracked on a monthly basis, and this information, along with specific long- run forec asts of individual sectors of the economy, is used to form the basis for the next fiscal year's estimated revenue collections. Preliminary estimates are supplied to the Department of Finance and Administration in mid-summer by the Department of Revenue and the University of Tennessee's Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research. Tax estimates are recalculated in October and November and refined in December and January for inclusion in the Governor's Budget Document. Sales tax estimates, Tennessee's largest tax source, are based on broad estimated retail sales activity trends, which are monitored by the Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research and the Department of Revenue. Tax estimates for corporate excise taxes, Tennessee's second largest tax s ource, include the latest national corporate profit forecasts and are analyzed against the state's October corporate tax returns , which help provide useful information in projecting quarterly estimated tax payments throughout the next year. Estimates for other excise taxes are commonly based on long run consumption trends for the selectively -taxed items: cigarettes, gasoline, beer, and alcoholic beverages. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) gross receipts tax estimates from in lieu of tax payments are also based on long run trend analysis. Motor vehicle fuel (primarily diesel fuel) taxes and motor vehicle registration fees are estimated conservatively, given their sensitivity to business cycles. The revenue estimating process in Tennessee incorporates the \"Good Practices in Revenue Estimating\" endorsed by the National Association of State Budget Officers and the Federation of Tax Administrators. This requires using national and state economic forecasts, developing an official revenue estimate, monitoring and reporting on monthly revenue collections, and revising estimates when appropriate. Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) 9 -4-5104, 5105, 5106, and 5202 specify the manner in which tax revenue estimates are prepared and transmitted to the General Assembly in the Bu dget Document. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration prepares revenue estimates based on advice from economists, internal staff, the Department of Revenue, and the State Funding Board. The State Funding Board, which is composed of the Governor, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Comptroller, the State Treasurer, and the Secretary of State, is charged with the responsibility to prepare a range of revenue growth estimates for the state to begin developing a budget. In preparing its range of revenue growth estimates the State Funding Board listens to forecasts from state university economists, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and the Department of Revenue. The State Funding Board's review and recommendations conc ern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The board's growth estimates provide a basis for the tax revenue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, the recommendation of revenue estimates in the budget is the responsibili ty of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and A-57 State of Tennessee State Tax Revenues Introduction Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 20 20-2021 The revenues necessary to finance state government are collected from a variety of sources.

The State Funding Board's review and recommendations conc ern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The board's growth estimates provide a basis for the tax revenue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, the recommendation of revenue estimates in the budget is the responsibili ty of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and A-58 Administration. The State Funding Board's most recent letter notifying the Governor and the chairmen of the Senate and House Finance, Ways and Means committees of its revenue growth estimates is included a t the end of the state revenues section in the subsection entitled \"State Funding Board, Range of Tax Revenue Estimates.\" This letter states the economic assumptions that affect the State Funding Board's recommendations. A more detailed economic overview is presented in the \"Budget Overview\" section of the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recommended in the Budget Document are shown in a following subsection entitled \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues.\" These taxes include not only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue (the major taxes), but also those collected and deposited to the general fund by some other line agencies in conjunction with carrying out their programs. In the revenue estimate charts, the latter are shown by collecting agency and are subtotaled as other state revenue. Following the chart comparing taxes for the three fiscal years are three individual charts that show collections by fund. The distribution of taxes among the funds on these charts is as provided by law as it existed for actual revenues in 2018- 2019, and as passed by the 2019 General Assembly for the 2019- 2020 estimates and 2020- 2021 estimates . The funds on the distribution charts, for the Budget Document presentation, are general fund, education (t rust) fund, highway (transportation) fund, debt service fund, and cities and counties (local government) fund. (For information about the inclusion of certain special revenue fund taxes and fees in the general fund estimates, see the \"Budget Process\" sect ion). Following the four tax revenue estimate charts is a chart detailing the revenues of regulatory boards, which contain the collections and estimates listed by board. This is a supporting schedule to the \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues\" charts, on which single lines for regulatory board fees appear. In addition to the general revenues detailed in this section, other revenues are collected by departments, institutions, and agencies and are appropriated directly to them. These are called departm ental revenues. In the Budget Document, these departmental revenues are estimated by program and are shown as federal revenue, other revenue (or, sometimes, current services and other revenue), and tuition and fees. The term \"other revenue\" includes interdepartmental revenue, current services revenue, non -governmental revenue, and revenue from cities and counties. These various departmental revenues consist of earnings and charges for goods and services; student tuition and fees in the higher education system; and donations, contributions, and grants - in-aid from the federal government, political subdivisions, foundations, corporations, and individuals. In a few cases, the other departmental revenues also include reserves from revolving funds or from the unencumbered balance and capital outlay (major maintenance) reserves, in instances in which specific legal authority to carry such funds forward exists. The departmental revenues are reflected in each department's budget as operating revenue. The next subsection titled \"Tax Expenditures\" presents two tax exemption charts labeled \"Items Not in Sales Tax Base\" and \"Major Tax Exemptions,\" as required by law. Subsequently, information presented in the subsection entitled \"Revenue Sources and Basis of Apportionment\" outlines the general tax revenues by collecting agency, along with TCA citations on the rate and source of the revenue and the basis of apportionment among funds and agencies, based on current law.

(For information about the inclusion of certain special revenue fund taxes and fees in the general fund estimates, see the \"Budget Process\" sect ion). Following the four tax revenue estimate charts is a chart detailing the revenues of regulatory boards, which contain the collections and estimates listed by board. This is a supporting schedule to the \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues\" charts, on which single lines for regulatory board fees appear. In addition to the general revenues detailed in this section, other revenues are collected by departments, institutions, and agencies and are appropriated directly to them. These are called departm ental revenues. In the Budget Document, these departmental revenues are estimated by program and are shown as federal revenue, other revenue (or, sometimes, current services and other revenue), and tuition and fees. The term \"other revenue\" includes interdepartmental revenue, current services revenue, non -governmental revenue, and revenue from cities and counties. These various departmental revenues consist of earnings and charges for goods and services; student tuition and fees in the higher education system; and donations, contributions, and grants - in-aid from the federal government, political subdivisions, foundations, corporations, and individuals. In a few cases, the other departmental revenues also include reserves from revolving funds or from the unencumbered balance and capital outlay (major maintenance) reserves, in instances in which specific legal authority to carry such funds forward exists. The departmental revenues are reflected in each department's budget as operating revenue. The next subsection titled \"Tax Expenditures\" presents two tax exemption charts labeled \"Items Not in Sales Tax Base\" and \"Major Tax Exemptions,\" as required by law. Subsequently, information presented in the subsection entitled \"Revenue Sources and Basis of Apportionment\" outlines the general tax revenues by collecting agency, along with TCA citations on the rate and source of the revenue and the basis of apportionment among funds and agencies, based on current law.

This section is intended to fulfill that statutory obligation. Under the law, the Budget Document is required to identify all exemptions from state taxes, to the extent that it is practicable, and estimate the amount of revenue that would have been collected by the state in the ensuing fiscal year, if the exemptions were not to exist. No format or reporting period is spec ified. Tax Exemptions It is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue lost for each of the tax exemptions found in the Tennessee code. For example, since 1947, the list of non- profit institutions that are exempt from the sales tax has grown dramati cally. Such institutions are allowed to buy tangible goods and certain services tax free. Retailers and sellers require proof of exemption and keep records of exempt sales; but tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue do not show detailed statistics on exempt sales by type of exempt entity. Such data is only available in the records of the thousands of individual retailers and vendors who sell directly to the public. Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1 -A and 1- B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for fiscal year 2020-2021. Table 1-A presents revenue foregone on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1 -B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this ta ble, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code. Summing tax exemptions may result in double -counting in cases where exemptions overlap. Second, the estimates of revenue loss provided in the tables do not generally take into account the impact of a change i n a particular tax provision on taxpayer behavior that impacts other taxes (the estimates do not reflect secondary or feedback effects).

The board was created by the 45th General Assembly with passage of Public Chapter 126, Public Acts of 1887, codified as Title 9, Chapter 9, and Section 101 of the Tennessee Code. By statute, the state's full faith and credit is pledged on all general obligations and all state revenue collected and allocated to the general fund, the debt service fund, and the highway fund is also cha rged for payment of principal and interest on such debt obligations issued after July 1, 2013. In addition, the state covenants with the holders of general obligation bonds issued after July 1, 2013, that no additional bonds will be issued unless the amou nt necessary to pay the maximum annual debt service obligation is 10 percent or less of all state revenue allocate d to the general fund, the debt service fund, and the highway fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, the debt limit calculation produced a maximum annual debt service debt limit of $838,261,770 . The annual debt service requirement on the state's outstanding debt, authorized but unissued debt, and proposed bond authorizations in the fiscal year 2020-2021 budget total $253,113,000, well below the maximum statutory debt limitation . The statutory debt limitation, therefore, provides for a substantial amount of additional debt capacity . Over the years, Tennessee has consistently maintained a relatively low debt burden. This has been accomplished through the use of sound, prudent, and conservative debt management practices adopted by the executive and legislative branches of government, with concurrence of the State Funding Board. Such practi ces include funding a portion of the state's capital program with surplus cash, cancellation of bond authorizations in lieu of issuing de bt, creating and maintaining a Rainy Day Fund to offset unanticipated revenue shortfalls, and the adoption of state sta tutes designed to control the issuance of excessive debt. The state continues to maintain a relative low debt burden, and access to the capital markets remains strong . Tennessee's commitment to conservative and prudent debt management is widely recognized by the nation's leading debt -rating agencies. Current ratings on the state's general obligation long -term debt are the highest available : Fitch AAA, Standard and Poor's AAA, and Moody's Investor Service Aaa. Tennessee issued $148 million in additional general obligation debt in the first six months of fiscal year 2019-2020 . As of June 30, 2019, Tennessee's total general obligation bonded indebtedness was $1,596,443,000, excluding the Facilities Revolving Fund (FRF). This debt was issued entirely for institutional and building construction. There were no new general obligation bond authorizations for institutional and building bonds and economic and community development grants in fiscal year 2019- 2020. Highway bond authorizations total $ 124,000,000. The state's practice of using surplus cash to finance road projects in lieu of issuing debt has been one of the key factors in Tennessee's ability to secure and retain very high bond ratings. Consistent with this long -standing policy, the State Funding Board cancelled $ 79,000,000 in highway construction bonds and $13, 474,478 in regular general obligation bond authorizations in fiscal year 2018-2019. The reduction in bond authorizations coupled with the Funding Board's action on bond cancellatio ns decreased the category of authorized but unissued bonds to $1, 095,575,000, which includes $ 247.8 million in capital construction bonds, $765.7 million in highway fund authorizations, and $82.1 million in FRF bonds. The recommended 2020-2021 capital budget is funded entirely from surplus cash in the amount of $275,069,800 and $1 48,929,400 from federal funds and other sources.

At a designated point in the year, a gencies and departments submit these project concepts to the Departments of General Services and Finance and Administration . Upon receipt of the capital budget requests, a phased approach of review is undertaken by the Departments of General Services and F inance and Administration . The initial phase focuses on a needs assessme nt to establish priority and direction. During this phase, feasibility and/or market studies are performed to determine the viability of the project, project risks, and potential routes of implementation. The goal of the initial phase is to generate a rec ommend ation regarding the disposition of the project. The next phase provides additional planning to develop better cost estimates. The end result of the above phased approach is the development and prioritization of a formal capital budget request. The various agencies and departments annually submit both their capital maintenance and capital improvement requests in priority order to the Department of Finance and Administration , Division of Budget . All capital budget requests are further reviewed on both a technical and financial basis upon receipt by the Department of Finance and Administration, Division of Budget. The projects are analyzed for funding requirements and consistency with program goals and are re viewed within projected avail ability of funds in the budget for the requested fiscal year. If funds are deemed to be insufficient, individual projects may be deferred to be included in future budgets or rejected. The a dministration intends for the needs of departmental programs to be the imp etus for all capital outlay, support program , and service requirements . Funding of projects is analyzed on priority of fiscal support for individual existing and new programs t o find the best mix of capital improvements and maintenance to sustain and implement programs. The management of facilities should be flexible enough to adjust to changing programs through renovation of existing assets. Attempts are made to minimize operational costs and future capital expenditures through better design and more f lexible layouts. When a capital project creates the need for additional operational funding, the operating costs are identified during the capital budget review and further re viewed in the develo pment of the budget in the year when the new space is expected to be occupied. Improvements to real property funded by public or private funds must be approved by the State Building Commission, comprised of seven ex- officio members: the Governor, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Treasurer, and the Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives. The State Building Commission, in addition to supervising improvements to real property, oversees leases by state agencies and the demol ition of structures located on state property. The capital items presented in this document as recommendations to the General Assembly reflect projects meeting State Building Commis sion requirements and policy guide lines. Capital maintenance projects are defined as major, non- routine repairs and replacements unrelated to n ew construction and costing $100,000 or more. Maintenance projects costing less than this amount are addressed within the departments' operational budget major maintenance programs. Capital maintenance projects include items that appreciably extend the life of the facility, such as alterations to rectify code deficiencies, modifica tions for health and safety issues, repairs to improve utility systems, repaving, roof repairs, exterior fencing and lighting, and repair projects that restore a facility to its former con dition and do not result in changes in facility use.

The workload of the court consists of cases appealed from lower courts. Supreme Court decisions act to resolve controversies arising out of Tennessee law and to establish guidelines for the lower courts to use in future decisions. The intermediate appellate courts are the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Court of Appeals hears appeals only in civil cases from the lower courts. The Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction to hear most felony and misdemeanor appeals from general trial courts, as well as post-conviction petitions.

Circuit courts, which sometimes overlap with the jurisdiction of Chancery courts, have jurisdiction to hear civil and criminal cases. Criminal courts have jurisdiction over criminal cases and hearing misdemeanor appeals from lower courts. Probate courts have primary jurisdiction over probate of wills and administration of estates. Courts of limited jurisdiction are funded locally and include General Sessions, Juvenile, and Municipal courts. Jurisdiction of General Sessions courts vary by county based on state laws and private acts; they hear civil, criminal, and juvenile cases, except in counties in which the Legislature has established separate Juvenile courts.

In addition to projecting expenditure levels, estimates of the major revenue sources, such as the sales, franchise, excise , and gasoline taxes, are prepared for both the current and next fiscal years. The revenue estimates are prepared by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration after receiving advice from the State Funding Board, as required by TCA section 9 -4- 5202. All revenue estimates, including estimates for licenses and fees, are part of the budget review by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Governor, and their staffs.

The law directs the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to prepare the budget in accordance with the Governor's directives. B-344 The Budget Process After the receipt of agency operational and capital budget requests, analysts with the Division of Budget begin the process of balancing expenditures against estimated revenues. Within this constraint, funds must be provided for administration initiatives of high priority, activities mandated by state or federal statute, and the day -to-day operat ion of state government. Instructions for the agency operational budget requests include the submission of three levels of requests: (a) a base request, which accommodates the continuation of current services, (b) a cost increase request, which includes funds to implement manda t- ed requirements, compensate for revenue reductions, initiate new programs, or e n- hance the base level due to increased costs of providing current services , and (c) a base budget reduction request . Capital budget requests are subm itted to the Division of Budget along with agency operating budget requests, where they are reviewed in conjunction with the Real Estate Asset Management office. Based on these reviews and available funding, recommen- dations are made to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and the Gove r- nor for consideration in the Budget Document. Following analysis of the requests by the Division of Budget, detailed recom - mendations are made to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. Meetings are convened with commissioners and directors of the departments and agencies by the Commissioner of Finance and Admin- istration. A consensus is sought with the agencies as to the appropriate funding level for the upcoming year. After these meetings are completed, t he Division of Budget staff makes any revis ions that have been agreed upon and presents the estimates to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration for his and the Governor's consideration. The Governor and the commissioner review the recommendations resulting from these hearings and consider necessary alterations to fit within the scope of the administration's initiatives and estimated revenues. The Governor may choose to conduct meetings or budget hearings with agency heads and may direct them to submit plans for furthe r adjustments to their budgets. After gubernatorial decisions have been finalized, the staff of the Division of Budget prepares the Budget Document for printing. Meanwhile, work begins on the Governor's Budget Message. The Budget Document must be presented to the General Assembly prior to February 1, or prior to March 1 when a newly elected Governor takes office, unless the General Assembly by joint resolution allows submission on a later date. At the time the Budget Document and Budg et Message are presented, the appropriation process is initiated. The Appropriations Bill, prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, is introduced and referred to the Finance, Ways and Means committees of both houses of the Legislature. T he various standing committees of the houses may review those parts of the Appropriations B ill that fall within their purviews. The departments often are invited to testify before these committees on issues relating to their budgets. After these committees report their reviews, the Finance, Ways and Means committees begin hearings on the budget in its entirety. Again, the departments may testify, and the Commissioner of Finance and Administration is invited to discuss the budget recommendations. Considerations made by the committees include the fiscal impacts caused by other legislation introduced by the members of both houses, recommendations of other legislative committees, and Appropriations Bill amendments filed by members of the Legislature. The Finance, Ways and Means committees of each house report out the Appropriations Bill with any amendments they recommend. The Appropriations Bill is then sent to Calendar committees of each house to be scheduled for floor action. The Senate and House of Representatives must pass the same Appropriations Bill in the same form for it to be enacted into law. Approval of The Budget Process the General Appropriations Bill usuall y occurs during the last week of the legislative session. In signing the bill into law, the Governor may line -item veto or reduce specific appropriations. He could veto the entire bill, but this rarely would be done. Any veto may be over -ridden by a majority of the elected members, each house acting separately. Tennessee has a tradition of enacting a single General Appropriations Act each year. Budget Execution When passage of the Appropriations Bill is complete and is signed or enacted into law, the execution of the act begins. Two important concepts are involved: preparation of work programs , and development of allotment controls. Invariably, there are changes to the Budget Document presented by the Governor to the General Assembly. These changes ar e made by amending the Appropriations Act during the adoption process. Analysts of the Division of Budget and fiscal personnel in the departments and agencies have the responsibility of reconciling the approved Appropriations Act with the Budget Document. This may involve increases or decreases to the agency allotments. The Division of Budget establishes an annual allotment for each agency and division using the reconciled Appropriations Act. This annual allotment, called the official work program, is p rovided to the Division of Accounts as a means of spending control. The agencies and divisions spend against these allotments during the fiscal year. Budget execution is a process that continues throughout the fiscal year. In addition to the daily review of numerous operational and personnel transaction requests, the budget analysts must ensure that the legislative intent of the Appropriations Act is being followed by the various departments and agencies. Further legislative review and control is maintain ed through the Fiscal Review Committee and the Finance, Ways and Means committees. In addition to the review of agency activities by these bodies, the Finance, Ways and Means committees must be informed of any new or expanded programs resulting from unanti cipated departmental revenues. These revenues usually are new federal grants, but also may be other departmental revenues. When notice of unexpected revenue is received by an agency, the Commissione r of Finance and Administration may submit an expansion report to the chairmen of the finance committees for acknowledgement , if he wants t o approve the program expansion. Upon the chairmen's acknowledgement of the expansion report, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration may allot the additional depart mental revenue to implement the proposed or expanded program. Agencies may not expand programs or implement new programs on their own authority. This expansion procedure is not used to increase allotments funded from state tax revenue sources. No appropri ations from state tax sources may be increased except pursuant to appropriations made by law. A transfer of appropriations between allotments for purposes other than those for which they were appropriated may not occur without the approval of the Commissio ner of Finance and Administration and a committee comprised of the Speakers of the House and the Senate , and the Comptroller of the Treasury. Throughout the fiscal year, the Division of Budget staff reviews the status of the various allotments and advises the Commissioner of Finance and Admin - istration of any problems. At the end of the fiscal year, the Division of Budget has the responsibility of executing revisions to the annual allotments as a function of the accounts closing process. B-345 The Budget Process After the receipt of agency operational and capital budget requests, analysts with the Division of Budget begin the process of balancing expenditures against estimated revenues. Within this constraint, funds must be provided for administration initiatives of high priority, activities mandated by state or federal statute, and the day -to-day operat ion of state government. Instructions for the agency operational budget requests include the submission of three levels of requests: (a) a base request, which accommodates the continuation of current services, (b) a cost increase request, which includes funds to implement manda t- ed requirements, compensate for revenue reductions, initiate new programs, or e n- hance the base level due to increased costs of providing current services , and (c) a base budget reduction request . Capital budget requests are subm itted to the Division of Budget along with agency operating budget requests, where they are reviewed in conjunction with the Real Estate Asset Management office. Based on these reviews and available funding, recommen- dations are made to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and the Gove r- nor for consideration in the Budget Document. Following analysis of the requests by the Division of Budget, detailed recom - mendations are made to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. Meetings are convened with commissioners and directors of the departments and agencies by the Commissioner of Finance and Admin- istration. A consensus is sought with the agencies as to the appropriate funding level for the upcoming year. After these meetings are completed, t he Division of Budget staff makes any revis ions that have been agreed upon and presents the estimates to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration for his and the Governor's consideration. The Governor and the commissioner review the recommendations resulting from these hearings and consider necessary alterations to fit within the scope of the administration's initiatives and estimated revenues. The Governor may choose to conduct meetings or budget hearings with agency heads and may direct them to submit plans for furthe r adjustments to their budgets. After gubernatorial decisions have been finalized, the staff of the Division of Budget prepares the Budget Document for printing. Meanwhile, work begins on the Governor's Budget Message. The Budget Document must be presented to the General Assembly prior to February 1, or prior to March 1 when a newly elected Governor takes office, unless the General Assembly by joint resolution allows submission on a later date. At the time the Budget Document and Budg et Message are presented, the appropriation process is initiated. The Appropriations Bill, prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, is introduced and referred to the Finance, Ways and Means committees of both houses of the Legislature. T he various standing committees of the houses may review those parts of the Appropriations B ill that fall within their purviews. The departments often are invited to testify before these committees on issues relating to their budgets. After these committees report their reviews, the Finance, Ways and Means committees begin hearings on the budget in its entirety. Again, the departments may testify, and the Commissioner of Finance and Administration is invited to discuss the budget recommendations. Considerations made by the committees include the fiscal impacts caused by other legislation introduced by the members of both houses, recommendations of other legislative committees, and Appropriations Bill amendments filed by members of the Legislature. The Finance, Ways and Means committees of each house report out the Appropriations Bill with any amendments they recommend. The Appropriations Bill is then sent to Calendar committees of each house to be scheduled for floor action. The Senate and House of Representatives must pass the same Appropriations Bill in the same form for it to be enacted into law. Approval of The Budget Process the General Appropriations Bill usuall y occurs during the last week of the legislative session. In signing the bill into law, the Governor may line -item veto or reduce specific appropriations. He could veto the entire bill, but this rarely would be done. Any veto may be over -ridden by a majority of the elected members, each house acting separately. Tennessee has a tradition of enacting a single General Appropriations Act each year. Budget Execution When passage of the Appropriations Bill is complete and is signed or enacted into law, the execution of the act begins. Two important concepts are involved: preparation of work programs , and development of allotment controls. Invariably, there are changes to the Budget Document presented by the Governor to the General Assembly. These changes ar e made by amending the Appropriations Act during the adoption process. Analysts of the Division of Budget and fiscal personnel in the departments and agencies have the responsibility of reconciling the approved Appropriations Act with the Budget Document. This may involve increases or decreases to the agency allotments. The Division of Budget establishes an annual allotment for each agency and division using the reconciled Appropriations Act. This annual allotment, called the official work program, is p rovided to the Division of Accounts as a means of spending control. The agencies and divisions spend against these allotments during the fiscal year. Budget execution is a process that continues throughout the fiscal year. In addition to the daily review of numerous operational and personnel transaction requests, the budget analysts must ensure that the legislative intent of the Appropriations Act is being followed by the various departments and agencies. Further legislative review and control is maintain ed through the Fiscal Review Committee and the Finance, Ways and Means committees. In addition to the review of agency activities by these bodies, the Finance, Ways and Means committees must be informed of any new or expanded programs resulting from unanti cipated departmental revenues. These revenues usually are new federal grants, but also may be other departmental revenues. When notice of unexpected revenue is received by an agency, the Commissione r of Finance and Administration may submit an expansion report to the chairmen of the finance committees for acknowledgement , if he wants t o approve the program expansion. Upon the chairmen's acknowledgement of the expansion report, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration may allot the additional depart mental revenue to implement the proposed or expanded program. Agencies may not expand programs or implement new programs on their own authority. This expansion procedure is not used to increase allotments funded from state tax revenue sources. No appropri ations from state tax sources may be increased except pursuant to appropriations made by law. A transfer of appropriations between allotments for purposes other than those for which they were appropriated may not occur without the approval of the Commissio ner of Finance and Administration and a committee comprised of the Speakers of the House and the Senate , and the Comptroller of the Treasury. Throughout the fiscal year, the Division of Budget staff reviews the status of the various allotments and advises the Commissioner of Finance and Admin - istration of any problems. At the end of the fiscal year, the Division of Budget has the responsibility of executing revisions to the annual allotments as a function of the accounts closing process. B-346 The Budget Process Audit and Review Post-audit and review also are functions that continue throughout the fiscal year. Post-audit is a responsibility of the Comptroller of the Treasury, an official elected by the General Assembly. The Division of State Audit, within the Comptroller' s Office, has the duty of conducting, supervising, and monitoring the audits of all state departments and agencies. Intermediate care facilities receiving Medicaid funds also are within the purview of this division, and state grants to other entities also are subject to aud it. In addition, program audits are performed to determine whether agencies are functioning efficiently. The General Assembly also participates in a continuing review throughout the fiscal year. The Fiscal Review Committee, a bipartisa n committee comprised of members from both houses, meets regularly when the General Assembly is not in session. Following a set agenda, members of this committee review audit reports and departmental personnel respond to inquiries about activities and programs under the department's jurisdiction. Governmental Accountability: Strategic Planning and Performance Measures The Governmental Accountability Act of 2013 amended the Governmental Accountability Act of 2002, whi ch requires strategic planning, perform ance measures, and performance audits. By August 15 each year, executive branch agencies submit strategic plans to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration who may require modifications. The commissioner must consolidate approved plans and submit them to the Governor and General Assembly by September 30 each year . For 2014, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, as allowed by law, exempted the Higher Education Commission and non -cabinet agencies from submitting plans to Finance and Administration, but encouraged the commission and non- cabinet agencies to continue the planning process. The judicial branch, Comptroller of the Treasury, State Treasurer, Secretary of State, Attorney General and Reporter, and legislative branch are not subject to strategic plan review by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. They must submit plans separately to the General Assembly and Governor by September 30. Under the Accountability Act, instructions for developing strategic plans and performance measures are issued to executive branch agencies by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, who under other law , also issues budget instructions to all agencies. The Governmental Accountability Act requires the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to annually evaluate strategic plans and performance measures. Also under the Governmental Accountability Act, as well as under other law, each state agency is subject to performance review by the Comptroller of the Treasury. The Governmental Accountability Acts of 2013 and 2002 continue the Tennessee tradition of strong executive management of the line agencies, begun with the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1923, and strong executive budget development and budget execution responsibility, begun with the budget law of 1937. The General Assembly has the prerogative to alter executive recommendations through the Appropriations Act and to alter policy and exert oversight through the legislative and performance review processes. State of Tennessee Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Budgeting Basis The annual Budget of the State of Tennessee is prepared on the modif ied accrual basis of accounting - the method under which revenues are recognized when they become available and measurable, and expenditures are recognized when the liability is incurred. Most appropriations generally lapse at the end of each fiscal year. Appropriations for contractual obligations in the highway fund do not lapse at year end but are carried forward for subsequent year expenditures . In addition, it is the state's budgetary practice to appropriate matching dollars for jointly funded projects in the year of federal apportionment. Most revenue collection estimates are presented on a mod ified accrual basis, consistent with the basis of accounting explained below. The law requires the Go vernor to present his proposed B udget to the General Assembly annually. The General Assembly enacts the Budget through passage of a general appropriations act. This act appropriates funds at the program level. Before signing the Appropriations Act, the Governor may veto or reduce any specific appropriation, subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed, the Budget , in the form of the Appropriat ions Act, becomes the state's financial plan for the coming year. Budgetary control is maintained at the program level by the individual departments and agencies, acting in conjunction with the Department of Finance and Administration. The latter has a D ivision of Budget and a Division of Accounts to execute budgetary controls. The Budget Document details the separation between payroll and operational funds by program. Any movement of funds between the payroll and operational funds requires approval and a revision to the budget by the Division of Budget on behalf of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and the Governor. Other budget revisions during the year, reflecting program changes or intradepartmental transfers of an administrative nature , require certain executive and legislative branch approval, pursuant to law. This is discussed in de tail in the \"Budget Process\" section. With proper legal authority, the Division of Budget, acting on behalf of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance a nd Administration, may execute allotment (or budget) revisions. The line agencies may not make these revisions themselves. In Tennessee, as in other states, appropriation of funds is a legislative power, not an executive power. No expenditures may be made and no allotments increased, except pursuant to appropriations made by law. For Budget Document purposes, all funds are classified as General Fund except for the Department of Transportation (t ransportation, or highway fund), Capital Outlay ( capital projects fund ), facilities revolving fund , debt service (or sinking ) fund, and Cities and Counties - State -Shared Taxes ( Local Government Fund). The Education Trust Fund, including the Lottery for Education Account, for which state tax revenues are estimated separately, is included in the general fund in the presentation of the \" Budget Overview ,\" although a separate fund balance statement for this fund is included in the \"Financial Statements\" section of the Budget Document. The presentation of all the ope rating budgets within the General Fund in the Budget Document , except for Transportation, is done for ease of budget presentation and understanding. In the Budget Document , revenue estimates for special revenue, internal service , and enterprise fund progr ams, funded by dedicated revenues, are included in the state tax revenue and departmental revenue estimates in the general fund, as are those programs' expenditures. Special Revenue Fund programs reflected in the general fund in the Budget Document are: Wildlife Resources Agency Boating Safety Wetlands Acquisition Fund Wetlands Compensation Fund Tennessee Public Utility Commission Education Fund B-347 The Budget Process Audit and Review Post-audit and review also are functions that continue throughout the fiscal year.

Enterprise Fund programs reflected in the general fund in the Budget Document are: Tennessee Housing Development Agency Grain Indemnity Fund Client Protection Fund. In the \"Budget Overview,\" Education Trust Fund programs are presented in the general fund, although the tax apportionments for the education fund are separately estimated. This, again, is done for ease of presentation and understanding of the Budget . It also is done because the taxes earmarked and apportioned to the education fund are less than the education appropriations, requiring general fund tax support for education programs. The programs in the Education Trust Fund are: (1) Department of Education (K -12), including general -source programs and the dedicated -source After -School Programs Special Account, funded by 100% of unclaimed lottery p rizes; (2) Higher Education, including state appropriations for the University of Tennessee, the State University and Community College System (Board of Regents) , the Foreign Language Center, and the dedicated -source appropriation in the Lottery for Educat ion Account; and (3) all funding sources for programs of the Higher Education Commission and the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation. In the Budget Document , certain institutional revenues for the two university systems are estimated. These include unrestricted educational and general revenues (E&G), and auxiliary enterprise funds. Examples of unrestricted E&G funds are student tuition and fees; unrestricted state, federal, local, and private gifts, grants, and contracts; local appropriations; and s ales and services related to academic programs. Restricted funds are not reflected in the Budget Document. Although presenting the operating budgets in this consolidated fashion makes the Budget Document easier to understand, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) does present the special revenue and other funds separate ly from the general fund. The Division of Accounts provides that document to the General Assembly and the public. Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Accounting B asis (From Division of Accounts, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report) The financial statements of the State of Tennessee are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). These principles require that the financial statements present the primary government and its component units, or the entities for which the government is considered to be financially accountable. Component units are discretely presented in a separate column in the government -wide financial statements to emphasize legal separation from the primary government. In the government -wide financial statements, the financial activities of the state are reported as governmental or business -type activiti es. The government -wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. In the fund financial statements, the state's major governmental funds include: General Fu nd - used to account for all financial transactions not required to be accounted for in other funds; Education Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with programs involving the Department s of Education and Higher Education. Fund ing is provided primarily from the dedicated sales and services taxes and federal monies received from the U.S. Department of Education. Net education lottery proceeds and 100% of unclaimed lottery prizes fund higher education scholarships and a fter-school programs; Highway Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with the Department of Transportation. Funding is provided from dedicated highway user taxes and funds received from the various federal transportation agen cies; and, Capital Projects Fund - used to account for the acquisition or construction of all major governmental capital facilities. The state's non- major governmental funds , reported in a single column, include: Special Revenue Fund - used to account for specific rev enues earmarked to finance particular or restricted programs and activities; Debt Service Fund - used to account for the payment of principal and interest on general long -term debt; and, Permanent Funds - used to account for legally restricted funds wher e only earnings, not principal, can be spent. All of the gover nmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this basis, revenues are recognized when they become measurable and available. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expendit ures related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are typically recorded only when payment is due. Principal revenue sources considered susceptible to accrual include taxes, federal funds, local funds , and investment income. Taxes and similar ly measurable fees and fines, are generally considered to be available if collected within 60 days after fiscal year -end. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue when all eligibility requirements impose d by the provider have been met, and the amount is received during the current period or within six months after fiscal year-end. The state uses this same six -month availability period for most other measurable revenues. However , tobacco and similar litigation settlement proceeds are generally considered available if collection is expected within 12 months after fiscal year -end. Licenses, permits, and other similar miscellaneous revenue items are considered measurable and available only when cash is received by the state.

Two of these funds are considered major fund s - sewer treatment loan fund and employment security fund. Non- major funds are reported in a single column; and, Internal Service Funds - used to account for goods or services provided to other departments or agencies of the state or other governments, on a cost reimbursement basis. These funds are reported in a single column. The proprietary funds are accounted for on the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. The state's fiduciary funds financial statements include: Pension Trust Fund - used to account for the activities of the state- administered retirement system; Employee Benefit Trust Fund - used to account for the funds contributed by employees under the IRC Section 125 cafeteria plan; Investment Trust Fund - used to account for the activities of the state-sponsored external investment pool; Private -Purpose Trust Funds - used to report trust arrangements under which the principal and income benefit indivi duals, private organizations, or other governments; and, Agency Funds - used to account for amounts held in custody of others. Fiduciary fund types are used to account for resources held in a trustee or agency capacity for others and cannot be used to support the government's own programs. The fiduciary funds are accounted for on the accrual basis of accounting, except for agency funds, which are custodial in nature and do not involve measurement of operations.
