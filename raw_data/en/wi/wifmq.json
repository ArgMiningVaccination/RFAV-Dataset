The Five Elements Theory is a way of eating that is based on [Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://www.eacuwell.com/chinese-medicine). According to this philosophy, the fire element, earth element, metal element, water element, and wood element govern our body. Each element corresponds with different parts of the human body and has different properties that influence our health. Read on to learn more about the Five Elements dietary approach and how to follow it yourself. What is the concept of the Five Elements? The Five Element Theory may be confusing to some, but picture this: It's summer and you have a scratchy, sore throat. You're probably not going to crave Spicy food. Instead, you would rather eat watermelon or cucumbers. This is an example of one of the five elements theories. Without knowledge of the principle, we often choose flavors and temperatures of foods that balance us and give us optimal health without even realizing it; however, there are always exceptions to every rule. The Five Elements Each element has unique properties that influence our digestive system and overall wellness. Water Element: The kidney and bladder organs are governed by the water element. Foods that contain water help to cleanse and detoxify the body, flush out toxins, and hydrate cells. Water-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, soups, and juices. Warming foods: beef, lamb, chicken, garlic, onions, leeks, ginger Cooling foods: cucumber, watermelon, mung bean, cabbage Wood Element: The liver and gall bladder organs are governed by the wood element. These organs are responsible for storing and releasing bile, which helps to break down fats. Warming: oatmeal, brown rice, millet, honey, grapes Cooling: celery, lettuce, broccoli, sprouts Fire Element: The small intestine and heart are governed by the fire element. Foods that are hot or spicy can help increase circulation and metabolism. Warming: chili pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves Cooling: watermelon, tomatoes, strawberries, oranges Earth Element: The spleen and stomach organs are governed by the earth element. These organs are responsible for breaking down and digesting food. Warming: sweet potatoes, yams, chestnuts, walnuts, peanuts, sesame seeds Cooling: radishes, carrots, beets Metal Element: The lungs and colon are governed by the metal element. These organs are responsible for breathing, as well as eliminating body fluids and waste. Warming: garlic, onions, leeks, ginger Cooling: pears, apples, bananas, papaya In the Shang Han Lun, written almost 2000 years ago, more than half of 112 herbal formulas contain foods such as cinnamon, ginger, dates, peppercorn, fennel, fava beans, Job's tears, licorice, and even rice wine and vinegar. Nutrition is a medicine that can heal through its therapeutic properties. How does flavor influence diet? The different flavors we consume can have therapeutic properties for our bodies. Bitter Foods For example, \"bitter\" foods effectively cool down the body and change its energy direction downwards. Bitter melon, parsley, dandelion, and green tea are all naturally bitter; as a result, they help reduce inflammation (the body's equivalent of \"heat\"), restlessness, or even infections. Sweet foods Conversely, \"sweet\"-tasting dishes nourish both the body and its fluids while also aiding digestion. A little \"sweet\" can help our bodies handle the actions of the other flavors. The Western diet is often overloaded with processed sugars which creates internal heat and inflammation in the body; leading to issues such as obesity, diabetes, etc. However, for those that lack vitality, Chinese yams can help by boosting energy levels and aiding digestion. Spicy foods The natural sweetness balances out the \"pungent\" or spicy flavors which tend to move energy outward and make you sweat. This is especially important when someone is fighting a viral infection. For example, drinking a little ginger tea can help a person overcome a cold. Overly spicy foods, on the other hand, can lead to heartburn or indigestion. Salty foods These flavors can help soften hard food, cool the body, and move energy inward. Salty seaweed is perfect for helping to soften thyroid nodules, and the selenium and iodide salts help improve thyroid function. Sour foods \"Sour\" foods slightly cooler the body temperature while also constricting (stopping loss from) intestines and sweat. Pomegranates spur stopping diarrhea while lemon water aids postmenopausal women who experience hot flashes or excessive sweating. How to implement temperature in nutrition? The \"temperature\" of foods does not correspond to the food's literal temperature, but rather how the nutrition will affect your body. In the same way that flavors can affect your body, so too can temperature. Warm foods help with digestion and circulation. Cool foods help calm the mind. Not only does energy have a temperature, but this temperature also has a direction. Cold descends while heat rises. Let's take bananas for example. They work wonders for constipation because the nature of a banana is cold; it descends and cools the bowels. Not only can hot-natured foods cause dehydration and trigger menopausal symptoms, but the way they are prepared also affects their heat or coolness. Grilling food causes it to release harmful chemicals that have been linked to cancer. Boiling or sauteing your foods will make them less likely to cause these problems. There can be an excess of an element in a person or a deficiency that causes poor health. This is the importance of choosing the best foods for an individual's life. Is color important for TCM? Different colors of foods can help target specific areas within the body. For example, if you are struggling with kidney pain in your lower back, consuming black-colored foods such as blackberries, black beans or black rice will be beneficial. If you're having trouble with digestion, eating naturally yellow or orange foods like ginger, squashes and yams will aid in the process. Lastly, problems with the liver can be minimized by incorporating more leafy greens into your diet. Many know the quote from Hippocrates, \"Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food.\" Chinese Food Therapy is an important component of TCM. The long history of nutrition therapy is recorded in many ancient medical books. Seasonal impact on a balanced diet With food shipping and global trade, it's more challenging to follow seasonal eats. Foods that grow and are supposed to be eaten during specific seasons help us make sensible choices about what we consume. Eating cooling foods like salads in winter can cause problems for the body while eating warm, nourishing soups will help the human body heal or stay healthy. Spring and Summer Spring and Summer seasoned food according to TCM diet therapy helps the body to reduce heat and dispel summer heat. Fruits such as watermelon, honeydew, and cantaloupe are recommended to help keep the body hydrated and cool. Spicy food like Sichuan dishes with chili pepper can increase perspiration and help the body to reduce heat. This is keen as long as the person consuming the food does not have a yin deficiency with resulting night sweats. Spring vegetables like asparagus, cabbage, and celery help to clear summer heat and detox the body. Fall and Winter Fall and Winter-seasoned food according to TCM diet therapy helps the body to warm and moisten. Fruits such as persimmons and pomegranates are suggested to help keep the body hydrated and warm. Slow-cooked stews and soups help to reduce wind and cold as well as hydrate the body. The Fall season is a time when the yin and yang of the universe are in balance\u2014the days and nights are of equal length. This is a time for transition and preparing for winter. The vibrancy of nature is moving inward and downward. It's time to do the same with your diet\u2014choose grounding foods that will the elements. In conclusion, following a seasonal diet may help maintain balance in the body while consuming foods of different colors helps target specific areas within the body that may need attention. Summary of this powerful Chinese Medicine approach The connection between what we eat and our health has been known for thousands of years. In the Western world, we tend to think of nutrition in terms of the chemicals it contains calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, etc. Different diets (paleo, keto, vegan/vegetarian) become controversial when they restrict certain types of foods. TCM embraces eating local, organically grown, seasonal foods while aligning nutrition with tastes, temperatures, colors, and seasons. Not only do different colors of foods help specific organs function better, but according to the yin and yang concept, consuming in-season foods helps balance out the effects of nature. Over 1400 years ago, Dr. Sun Si Miao stated the importance of food therapy: \"a good medicine worker should first detect the origin of the disharmony, be aware of the disease, first should treat it with food therapy; if the food doesn't do the trick, and then follow with herbal medicine.\" You can also select Five Element constitutional nutrition therapy based on your system for optimal wellness. Final Remarks If you're interested in understanding nutrition therapy, the Five Element Theory is a great place to start. There are many other facets of food therapy to consider. A qualified Chinese Medicine physician with experience in nutrition therapy can assist you to make choices that match your wellness issues best. Not only is medicine and reasonable way to help our bodies heal, but making these changes also helps us maintain disease prevention and wellness simultaneously. It's a journey in life worth taking!
