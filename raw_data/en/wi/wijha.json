Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the best way to protect both of you against the virus. The CDC, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( [ACOG](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care)), and Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine ( [SMFM](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care)) recommend you get vaccinated if you: - Are pregnant - May become pregnant in the future, or are - Currently breastfeeding. Getting vaccinated before becoming pregnant or early in your pregnancy is the best way to reduce risk of complications for you and your baby. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective. The COVID-19 vaccine protects you from serious illness and keeps you healthy, so you can keep your baby healthy. There is no evidence that any vaccine - including any of the three COVID-19 vaccines - cause fertility problems in women or men. Studies have shown that vaccines do not affect your chances for becoming pregnant. They also do not increase your risk of miscarriage. The COVID-19 vaccine is even more important if you are pregnant. Pregnant people who get COVID during their pregnancy are at higher risk of having a preterm birth. Being pregnant puts you at significantly higher risk for severe COVID. When you are pregnant, your body changes in many ways. Your risk of getting severe COVID increases due to these changes, including: - Increased heart rate - Increased oxygen consumption, and - Decreased lung capacity. The benefits of getting the COVID-19 vaccine and protecting yourself from the known risks of the disease far outweigh the possibility of risk from the vaccine. Creating a COVID-safe \"cocoon\" can further protect your baby. Parents can create a \"cocoon\" around their baby by asking family and friends who may spend time with the baby to get vaccinated to provide further protection from COVID-19. Talk to your OBGYN if you have questions. It's normal to have questions about something new. And COVID-19 vaccines are no exception. The best person to talk to if you have concerns about your pregnancy or fertility is your OBGYN. MotherToBaby is another resource you can contact.
