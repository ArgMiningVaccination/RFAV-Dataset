In the Chinese medicine framework, the free flow of chi throughout the body produces optimal health. Chi is believed to flow along twelve defined pathways, called meridians, which are connected to specific organs. If chi is blocked in any way, illness may result. Acupuncture works to restore the flow of chi throughout your body by placing very thin, stainless steel, sterile needles at various points in your body. There are as many as 365 acupuncture points along the meridian pathways where needles can be inserted to restore a balance of energy. During your treatment, your acupuncturist will first start by selecting points along the appropriate meridians, which will be cleaned with cotton that has been dipped in alcohol. Sterilized needles are then placed on the selected points. Acupuncture needles are different lengths and gauges, but are generally hair-thin, solid and made of stainless steel. Some acupuncturists may use pre-sterilized, disposable needles. Typically needles are placed just below the skin's surface, but some may go deeper, depending on the points being treated. Usually, most patients only experience a brief sensation as the needle is first being placed. Once the needles are in place, they generally cannot be felt. Many patients find the treatment very relaxing and experience a feeling of well-being. Often patients are surprised at how comfortable they are during the treatment and how easily the needles are placed. Needles typically stay in place for about 30 minutes; however, this may vary depending on your individual needs. After your acupuncturist removes your needles, your insertion points are gently cleansed with cotton that has been dipped in alcohol. FACIAL ACUPUNCTURE FACE AND NECK REJUVENATION Acupuncture has been done for hundreds of years to cure the body of ailments before the rise of Western medicine. Due to its effectiveness, there has been a growing trend of women and men of all ages applying the procedure to their faces as well. Acupuncture remedies the surface effects of aging by triggering a self-repair response in the skin and addressing the internal stressors that contribute to the signs of aging. This ancient beauty secret is a non-invasive and natural approach to reduce the signs of aging and help skin regain its youthful glow. It is the only targeted beauty treatment with direct health and well-being benefits. And the real beauty of getting cosmetic acupuncture is it also includes traditional acupuncture at the same time. It's about time you can combine beauty and health. HOW DOES IT WORK? Needles as thin as a strand of hair are inserted carefully into key areas and creases in the face, causing tiny microtrauma to the skin that trigger an increase in blood flow and activate collagen production. The result is revitalized and nourished skin, a brighter complexion and a more youthful appearance. We use The Mei Zen protocol. Mei Zen is a cosmetic acupuncture technique based in Chinese medicine that addresses the internal and external causes of aging. Mei Zen translates to \"beautiful people.\" Cosmetic acupuncture begins with body needles to balance and relax the body. Then, fine dermal needles are inserted into the face and/or neck. The protocol \"Mei Zen\" is followed to perform needling in specific fine lines and wrinkles. WHAT DOES EACH SESSION CONSIST OF? Facial or neck acupuncture + traditional acupuncture Facial and neck massage BENEFITS OF COSMETIC ACUPUNCTURE Cosmetic acupuncture promotes subtle, natural looking changes to the skin over time. Facial needles used as part of the Mei Zen protocol improve blood circulation, nourish the skin, increase natural collagen production, and diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and dull skin. Benefits of cosmetic acupuncture include: Reduction of Fine Lines Softening of deeper wrinkles Lifting and toning muscles Evening of skin tone and texture Reduction of under eye bags Improved Complexion Increases Circulation WHAT ARE THE RISKS? Cosmetic acupuncture is a chemical-free, natural approach to anti-aging, without the side effects, risks and downtime of more invasive cosmetic procedures. Most patients do not experience any complications. However, a small amount of bleeding, bruising or puffiness may occasionally occur. WHO IS COSMETIC ACUPUNCTURE FOR?
