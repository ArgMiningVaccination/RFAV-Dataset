Aromatherapy and Aroma Acu Therapy [Aroma AcuPoint Therapy (45 minutes): This treatment combines the unique healing power of essential oils with the theoretical understandings of Chinese Medicine. ](https://kunlunmtn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/aromatherapy-810x540-1.jpg) After a brief evaluation to determine your session goals, your acupuncturist will choose a specific Aroma AcuPoint protocol. Depending on the protocol selected, specific oils are applied by finger or with the use of a cotton ball and held on acupuncture points throughout the body for up to a minute on each point. Essential oils have a direct, measurable effect on the body. As the oils are absorbed by the olfactory pathways of the cranial nerves, nuero-endocrine functions in the brain and body are activated. Localized absorption through the skin and into the blood circulation at specific acupuncture points activates the properties of each point and effects change in the muscular and neuromuscular systems. This is a wonderful treatment for someone who wishes to receive the powerful benefits of Chinese Medicine treatments, but is afraid of or cannot tolerate needle stimulation. Genuine essential oils are specialized plant extracts. The alchemical process of extracting the plant constituents strengthens and changes the therapeutic function of the plant, rendering essential oils more \"drug-like\" in terms of their effects relative to whole-herb extracts found in tinctures and herbal supplements. This chemical change often allows one to enjoy the therapeutic effects of an essential oil without the same adverse reaction that one might have to the whole-plant. For example, people who are sensitive to fake or manufactured \"fragrances\" find that they can enjoy the true \"scent\" of a high-quality, unadulterated essential oil. Patients who have allergies or sensitivities to certain plants do not typically experience the same adverse allergic reaction to the plant's essential oil. [At Kunlun Mountain Acupuncture, we use essential oils from highly reputable companies that source organic or wild-crafted plants to produce unadulterated, artisanal, small-batch oils verified through independent third-party testing. Our primary oil supply company (Snow Lotus) is owned by a fellow acupuncturist with 35 years experience and formal training as a medical herbalist!](https://kunlunmtn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hyssopSL-e1578406339813.jpg) Due to insurance industry rules and definitions, the use of essential oils can only be billed to insurance when it is an integral and included part of your full acupuncture needle treatment. Therefore, Aroma AcuPoint technique treatments cannot be billed to insurance.
