The legislation, theMental Health Parity Act of2007 (S. 558), was passed byunanimous consent. For decades, health plans have restricted their coverage ofsuch treatments by requiringhigher deductibles and copay-ments, providing treatment cov-erage for only a short list ofmental disorders and placingarbitrary limits on service use.Current federal law prohibitsseparate and unequal dollarcoverage limits for mentalhealth services but allows allother forms of insurance dis-crimination. Advocates havetried for years to expand uponthe federal law, which has beensuperseded by stronger laws inseveral states.Following months of behind- the-scenes negotiations be-tween mental health groups, spearheaded Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.)and Pete Domenici (R-N.M.),an agreement on broad paritylegislation was reached earlierthis year. The Senate Health,Education, Labor and PensionsCommittee approved the legis-lation in February, and it hascontinued to be refined sincethat time. The legislation will affect an estimated 113 million Ameri-cans enrolled in group healthplans, specifying that treatmentlimitations and financial re-quirements applicable to mentalhealth benefits \u2014 including fortreatment of addictive disorders\u2014 are \"no more restrictive\"than the limitations and require-ments placed on substantiallyall medical and surgical bene-fits. In one notable change fromearlier versions of the bill, the legislation does not pre-emptstronger state laws. The billdoes not apply to small employ-er health plans and allowshealth plans to seek an exemp-tion from parity requirements ifthey can demonstrate signifi-cant cost increases associatedwith implementing parity. The American Counseling Association applauds Kennedy,Domenici and Enzi, along withthe rest of their colleagues inthe Senate, on this historic stepforward for individuals withmental and addictive disorders.ACA is working in coalitionwith other mental health advo-cacy organizations to gain swiftHouse passage of similar legis-lation (H.R. 1424, the PaulWellstone Mental and Addic-tion Equity Act of 2007) so thata final version of parity legisla-tion may be enacted this year.

IIt's time to stop being silent about inadequate counselor compensation Counselors and other mental health professionals are insulted,yet we passively remain indif-ferent. ACAeNews recently pub- lished the average salary ofcounselors. The showwhat we already knew: We aregrossly undervalued and, conse-quently, grossly underpaid. Counselors provide an invalu- able service to our communities.Our work benefits and improvessociety and leads individuals toachieve greater potential. Be-cause of our work, lives arerestored and relationships mend-ed. We ameliorate suffering, im-prove functionality and increaseproductivity. Far from being glo-rious, our work is a slow, oftenlaborious and frequently thank-less process that requires dedi-cation and commitment. Ourwork is hard, and we labor toearn our livelihood. Counselors are some of the brightest and most talented citi-zens. A counselor must be intel-ligent, innovative and consumer-driven. We could have pickedmany other professions. Instead,we picked a career that requires,on average, a master's degree,the pursuit of licensure and con-tinuous professional develop-ment. Our career demands a sig-nificant investment of time,energy and money. Sadly, weremain inadequately compensat-ed and see little return on ourinvestment. The Bureau of Labor Statis- tics, as cited in ACAeNews , reported the average earningsfor counselors to be $43,500. Instark contrast, other sources(such as www.census.gov ) report the average earnings for peoplewith a master's degree to beclose to $68,000. On average,our profession is paid $24,500less than our education deserves. I know a counselor with a master's degree in Californiawho gets paid $15 an hour. Herdaughter, still in college, getspaid $11.50 an hour to assistwith gymnastics lessons. Anoth-er counselor in New Jersey doesnot know how long he canremain in the profession becausethe pay is not enough to supporthis family. I find it ironic that, though we are taught to advocate boldly forour clients, we are timid aboutadvocating for ourselves. Thereseems to be a helpless indiffer-ence about this among coun-selors. We know we are not paidfairly, but we somehow refuse tobe outraged. We may talk about this with our colleagues but onlywith passing recognition. It is asif we cannot allow ourselves tosee this inequity. I recognize the historical roots of this phenomenon and believethat as counselors resolve theiridentity, attack stigma, improvelicensure and become morevocal in the mental health arena,compensation will improve.However, I do not see this as a\"counselor-only\" issue. I see thispertaining to all mental healthprofessionals. From counselorsto social workers to psycholo-gists, we are inadequately com-pensated as it relates to our edu-cation and labor. For this reason,all providers of mental healthservices must speak out on thismatter. However, if counselorsare serious about taking leader-ship in our field, then we mustlead the conversation. We must recognize this prob- lem and become vocal about thisinequity. Our dialogue must beaudible, inclusive, direct andspecific. Much work must bedone to improve parity in com-pensation. We must come to-gether and find solutions. Every-one must participate.

Mission Statement The mission of the American Coun-seling Association is to enhance thequality of life in society by promot-ing the development of professionalcounselors, advancing the counsel-ing profession, and using the pro-fession and practice of counselingto promote respect for human dignity and diversity.Counseling T oday V olume 50/Number 4 Letters have attempted to educate our students on healthy relation-ships. However, this semesterwe are beginning to see anincrease in counseling visitsregarding unhealthy relation-ships. I would like to think thatthis is because of the educationbeing provided and that studentsare beginning to feel more com-fortable with seeking our ser-vices. I hope to enhance ourtraining by including some ofthe research from this article.Linda ColbertTexas A&M University at Galveston Perceived double standard leads to questioning ofdiversity movement In their August 2007 Dignity, Development & Diversity col- umn, Michael D'Andrea andJudy Daniels comment that\"many\" white persons minimizethe complex problem of racismin our society. In my experience,it is not that white persons do notacknowledge the problem ofracism, but rather that they aremore at odds with current mod-els of how to address the issue.Many of the methods reliedupon by multiculturalists to,ostensibly, bring people togetherseem designed only to create asense of victimization amongmembers of minority groups anda sense of guilt among whites. In the August piece, the reader is given the address where onemay write to express support forthe \"Jena Six.\" These six indi-viduals were allegedly involvedin beating a white studentunconscious after nooses werehung from a tree on the schoolcampus. If a racist prosecutor isin fact targeting these youngpeople, it should be brought tolight and spoken against. But nowhere in the column is there any denunciation of theviolence that these same six arealleged to have committed. Alsomissing is any address by whichone might express support for,apparently, the only victim ofphysical violence associatedwith the case. I have nowhereread that this student wasinvolved with the abhorrenthanging of the nooses at theschool. If the authors wish to under- stand why \"some\" whites do nottrust the so-called diversitymovement, they perhaps needlook no further than their owncolumn. Double standards al-ways lead to mistrust, as theyrightfully should.Doug Smithdougsmith783@msn.com Continued on page 42From the President - BY BRIAN S. CANFIELD Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 5The Great Seal of the United States of America bears theLatin motto \" E Pluribus Unum. \" The motto's literal translation,\"Out of many, one,\" originallyreferred to the union betweenthe 13 original states and thefederal government. However,the motto holds multiple mean-ings. It also underscores ourcountry's identity as a nation ofimmigrants, with each group'sunique traditions and cultureenriching the unified whole. Italso refers to the culturally plu-ralistic and multiethnic nature ofmodern American society. It's agreat motto that reminds us thereis strength in our numbers anddiversity. For me, this motto alsoholds meaning for the future ofthe counseling profession. Many changes have taken place in the field of counselingand within the American Coun-seling Association during thepast 50 years. We have grownfrom a confederation of fourorganizations in 1952 to an orga-nization that today represents 19divisions. During this period,counseling has grown from amere idea to a \"bona fide\" pro- fession with more than 100,000Licensed Professional Coun-selors in 49 States. I recently reread a column in a 1993 edition of the ACA Guide- post (forerunner of Counseling Today ) in which Ted Remley, then ACA's executive director,wrote of the risks of \"specializa-tion\" within the field of counsel-ing and extolled the need forcounseling to be a \"single andunified profession.\" While no-table advances have been madetoward the establishment of acommon counselor identity (e.g.,licensure), there remains a trendtoward increased professionaldiversification and specializationrather than greater professionalhomogeneity. In many respects,counseling remains a disconnect-ed field characterized by partisansocial and political interests andcompeting factions \u2014 real orimagined. I must confess that I remain a big fan of diversity and special-ization within the counselingprofession. However, I appreci-ate that if counseling is ever tofulfill its potential as a \"helping profession,\" we must find betterways to incorporate our diversi-ty into a unified professionalidentity. Several years back, ACA dis- member-ship. This policy change result-ed in some unintended conse-quences, not the least of whichwas a precipitous drop in overalldivision membership numbersand, at least correlationally, anotable decline in general ACAmembership over the pastdecade. Two of our largest and most important divisions, the Ameri-can School Counselor Associa-tion and the American MentalHealth Counselors Association,while still part of ACA, electedsome years back to take paths ofgreater operational autonomy.Similarly, two organizationsconceived and nurtured byACA, the National Board forCertified Counselors and theCouncil for Accreditation ofCounseling and Related Educa-tional Programs, have evolved into independent bodies, albeitmaintaining close collaborationwith ACA. Currently, many counselors are active members of their statebranch but are not members ofACA. Some counselors aremembers of an ACA division butchoose not to join ACA or theirstate branch. And many ACAmembers do not join their statebranch or any division. Thisneeds to change through profes-sional education, membershipincentives and the adoption ofmore enlightened policies. I believe it important that we not dwell on either the success-es or the missteps of the past.Rather, I hope we can marshaland focus our collective effortsto build a more responsive andeffective ACA for the future. Asingle professional associationwith 100,000 members will playa much more meaningful role insociety than 20 professionalassociations with 5,000 mem-bers each. Respecting and em-bracing the professional diversi-ty that exists, and has alwaysexisted, within the counseling field is not mutually exclusive tobuilding a unified profession. ACA plays a critical leader- ship role within the field ofcounseling. While many of ourdivisions and affiliate groupsengage in uniquely importantwork, only ACA is in a position to serve as the common and uni-fying voice for the entir ecoun- seling profession. All counseling professionals should view membership inACA, along with membership inan ACA division and branch, asa professional responsibility andan investment not only in theirpersonal future, but in the col-lective future of our profession.To assist in this process, theACA Governing Council will beworking to establish collabora-tive membership options toexpand membership in ACA, itsdivisions and branches. \"Many uniting into one\" \u2014 together we can make a difference! IMany uniting into one Building on a foundation of support Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 6Nearly 30 years ago, the American Counseling Associa-tion formed a foundation thatwas originally funded from theproceeds of the sale of the asso-ciation's headquarters buildingin Washington, D.C. During the past three decades, manychanges have occurred in theprofession, the association andsociety at large. To keep pacewith such changes, the entitynow known as the ACA Foun-dation has found it necessary toevolve to continue its relevanceto its major constituencies,namely the counseling profes-sion and ACA. Last month, the Board of Trustees of the ACA Founda-tion met and engaged in long-range and strategic planningthat will help position the orga-nization to meet the needs oftoday's, as well as tomorrow's,professional counselor. With theaddition of Skip Hansen, theFoundation's full-time directorof development, the staffingneeded to help implement thestrategic plan is now in place.The Board of Trustees mem-bers, chaired this year by TerriLonowski of Atlanta, once again committed themselves tocontinuing their support ofACA, graduate students, fellowcounselors and those who bene-fit from the work of profession-al counselors. The ACA Foundation contin- ues to need one key ingredient,however. That ingredient is you. We all need to do what we canto support the ACA Foundationbecause, together, we really canmake a difference. Our impacton the issues facing profession-al counselors and emergingcounselors is even more signifi-cant when we work collectively\u2014 and, yes, that means whenwe make donations of time andmoney to the Foundation. TheACA Foundation is the onlyorganization dedicated to sup-porting ACA and the myriadissues facing many special areasof the profession. I am pleased to say that every board member of the ACAFoundation has made a finan-cial commitment. Many mem-bers of ACA's Governing Coun-cil and our ACA past presidentscontinue to support the Founda-tion every year as well. In fact, two ACA past presidents,Courtland Lee and SamGladding, have committed todonate the royalties from someof their books to the Founda-tion. These generous actions,along with many more, demon-strate to me the special bondthat the Foundation has forgedwith the counseling professionand ACA. Other examplesshowing your colleagues' gen-erosity would take up this entirecolumn. Needless to say, we areall very appreciative of suchgenerous efforts. Among its accomplishments during the past year, the ACAFoundation Board of Trusteesundertook the task of redesign-ing the Foundation website. Theupdated site can be viewed atwww.acafoundation.org . I hope you will take a moment tocheck it out and then visit itagain from time to time to learnabout the Foundation's latestactivities and how ongoing pro-jects are progressing. In case you aren't familiar with some of the projects thatthe ACA Foundation supports,let me tell you about a few of its endeavors. The Foundation hasa great interest in supportinggraduate counseling students,given their important role incarrying the profession forward.The Foundation supports theGraduate Student Essay Com-petition, the Graduate StudentLounge at the ACA AnnualConference and the develop-ment of publications used bygraduate students. Many of you are aware of the ACA Foundation's efforts toencourage \"counselors helpingcounselors\" through its Coun-selors Care Fund. This fund wasestablished to aid counselorswho were directly affected bythe hurricanes that hit the GulfCoast region of the UnitedStates two years ago. For everydollar you donated, the Founda-tion committed to match thedonation. To date, several thou-sand dollars in grants have beenmade to your colleaguesimpacted by the hurricanes. One of the Foundation's sig- nature projects is the GrowingHappy and Confident Kids pro-gram. Each elementary schoolcounselor who wins a Growing Happy and Confident Kids grantis provided with as many as 20books, each carefully selectedbecause it deals with an issue ortopic that impacts kids, such asbullying, divorce, diversity orfamily relationships. The ACAFoundation has awarded morethan 50 grants, and it hopes toincrease that number signifi-cantly during the next few years.For more information on apply-ing for a Growing Happy andConfident Kids grant, visitwww.acafoundation.org . When we all work together for the collective good, veryspecial things can happen. I liketo think that the evolution of theACA Foundation is an exampleof that thought.

She explains that cupping is the practice of placing smallcups on a portion of the body, usually theback, and creating a vacuum to draw toxinstoward the skin surface. As was the case with many of the other counseling delegates, Arredondo was veryinterested in finding out more aboutChina's changing family dynamic. Forexample, she says, although senior citizensare still revered and respected in China,many are being forced to continue working Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 9the experience has inspired me to go back again.\" Arredondo wasn't the only participant motivated by theeducational discussions in Mon-golia. She says the Americandelegates feverishly took notesand soaked up as much as theycould from their Mongoliancounterparts. Because many ofthe professionals there spokeEnglish, the need for a transla-tor wasn't as great, and theexchanges were more candidand fluid. \"We had lunch in Mongolia with several people from theuniversity \u2014 faculty, students,other organizations associatedwith the university, an agencydirector and a psychologist,\"she says. \"Their English wasvery good, so there were a lotmore opportunities to learnfrom them during the informalexchanges and coffee breaks.People would just continue theconversations outside the pre-sentations. (The Mongolian pro-fessionals) were very forthcom-ing and initiating. I was veryimpressed with the Mongolianpresenters \u2014 all women by theway \u2014 who were heads of thedepartments. They were veryengaging and well-educatedfolks.\" Arredondo notes that, in Mongolia, people employed inmental health professions dur-ing the late 1970s receivedtraining heavily influenced bythe former Soviet Union. How-ever, she says, when Mongoliabegan transitioning from social-ism to democracy, the trainingswitched largely from Russian-based methods to more Westernconcepts, including group, fam-ily and individual therapy tech-niques based on the teachings ofcounseling pioneer Carl Rogers. \"They (the Mongolian profes- sionals) have a lot of influencefrom psychiatry, but they are try-ing to make that less dominantin that they are looking at coun-seling models of psychothera-py,\" she says. \"They want tofocus on helping the peoplerather than the pathology.\" She notes that a small group of U.S. delegates also had thechance to meet with a Mongo-lian spiritualist and were intro-duced to cultural, herbal andspiritual practices. The spiritualand religious aspects of mentalhealth were discussed in bothMongolia and China. Arredondo also reports that the group witnessed severallocal people at a monastery inMongolia seeking the guidanceof monks. \"While we were vis-iting, we saw a young man andhis parents sitting with themonks,\" she says. \"Apparently,after (a person) presents theirissue, the monk pulls one of the Continued on page 23Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 10 Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 11It was shortly after I started graduate school that I began toreally embrace the idea of self-care. Having worked in thebusiness world for 15 years,self-care definitely was notsomething I had known muchabout or practiced as part ofbeing a better employee. Inbusiness, my understandingwas that the more your life wasconsumed by your job the bet-ter, and all should be sacrificedfor the company. In joining thecounseling profession, howrefreshing it was to be encour-aged to take care of myself, notonly for my own betterment,but also for my clients' welfare.I truly took the idea to heart. Balance has always been important to me. Ever since Iwas little, I have explored manydifferent interests and activities.As I got older, I always had var-ious projects going on at homeand outside of work. I havenever been one to sit still. Soself-care was easy for me toembrace and promote to othersas a way not to get burned outin any one area of life. Self-care was a concept that was especially important to mewhile attending graduate school.At that time, I was in my mid-30s, attending classes, teachingkindergarten part time, interningand being a single mom to apreadolescent daughter. I knewif I wasn't careful, I wouldquickly become overstressed. SoI was deliberate about schedul-ing tasks and activities well,being as present as I could bewherever I was and making sureI had time for family, friends andmyself. Toward the end of my school- ing, my brother moved back tothe area with his new family. Hehad been away for longer than10 years, and I was very happyto have him close again, espe-cially with a new wife, stepchil-dren and my brand new nephew.His stepdaughter, however, washaving difficulty with the transi-tion. A month after arriving, shewas hospitalized for a 10-daypsychiatric evaluation. Because my clinical focus was children, I was naturallycurious about what was goingon with my niece. I knew myfamily didn't have any experi-ence with mental health issues, so I wanted to provide as muchhelp and support as I could. Ifelt it was my responsibility totake care of everyone duringthis difficult time, providing forall their different needs. During the next several weeks, I made many calls tomy brother and his wife to offeradvice, education and support.I made more calls to my par-ents to help them better under-stand what was happening, howto respond to the situation andhow to help my brother and hisfamily. I had late-night talkswith my daughter, who wasscared for her step-cousinbecause she had been hospital-ized and scared for herself,wondering if the same thingcould happen to her. I alsowanted to offer my support andunderstanding to my step-nieceso she wouldn't feel shunnedand alone. After school, work or my internship, I made a fewvisits to the hospital, which was45 minutes away. By the end of the week, I real- ized my whole world now con-sisted of mental health issues. Iwas learning about them inschool, observing and manag-ing behaviors in kindergarten,counseling children at myinternship and assisting myfamily to provide help for myniece. One night, I looked overto my bedside table and realizedthat even my \"leisurely read-ing\" was about psychoticbehavior. Without meaning to, Ihad completely surrounded my-self with mental health. I wasno longer \"balanced.\" This revelation truly took me by surprise. I have never been a\"workaholic,\" nor have I limit-ed myself to a bare minimumof interests and activities. Howcould I have become, uncon- sciously, so preoccupied solelywith mental health? I knew bet-ter than this. I knew it was aquick way to wear myself downand burn myself out. This wasjust not my personality. As Ithought more about it, I real-ized I had immersed myself allin the name of \"becoming abetter counselor.\" I had beenhelping everyone and trying tolearn all that I could, as fast asI could, and all at once.Patience has never been one ofmy virtues. I quickly changed what I could. I put the academic textsaway and replaced them withmystery novels. After my niecewas released, I remained avail-able to my family when need-ed, but otherwise became lessinvolved with the situation.There was nothing I could doabout the other factors \u2014school, kindergarten, internship \u2014 but I made sure to work intime to spend with my daughterand friends and for exercising.Things returned to normal, andmy stress level went down. Iwas very glad to have learnedthe lesson of the importance ofself-care and remaining bal-anced. I swore to myself to bemore vigilant. I even gave pre-sentations on the importance ofself-care to my classmates andcolleagues. I was now evenmore dedicated to the idea ofself-care, and I made it a high-er priority. Eight months went by and summer arrived. My daughterwas off to a sleepaway campfor two weeks. I thought tomyself, \"Now I can be a reallygood counselor. I can be avail-able for my clients at any time.\" Before you know it Continued on page 36 Finding Your Way - BY LORI MYLESCounseling T oday IOctober 2007 12BY ANGELA KENNEDY In most hospitals, cell phones are prohibited. This seeminglyinsignificant rule doesn't affectmost people until they have aloved one in a medical crisis.Then \u2014 not being able to call,stay in touch, report progress\u2014 it can become an additionalburden during an alreadystressful situation. It's not uncommon to see families lined up outside wait-ing rooms and intensive careunits to use either a local phoneline or a worn out pay phonedown the hall. They are oftentorn between staying near theirloved one's bedside or leavingtemporarily to call and updateconcerned friends and family athome. This was the challenge Sona Mehring faced 10 years agowhen a close friend was strug-gling with a high-risk pregnan-cy. Mehring took the initiativeto become the point of contact as the couple fought for theirnewborn's life. Instead of mak-ing call after call or asking fam-ily members to relay messagesto each other, update everyoneabout Baby Brighid's progresssimultaneously. \"My two good friends had a very premature baby, and theyasked me to let everybodyknow what was going on,\"Mehring explains. \"Instead ofmaking phone calls, I made awebsite. It certainly made itinstantly easier to let everyoneknow what was going on. But italso became this connectingpoint bringing all their friendsand family together to helpthem in this situation.\" The website made it possible for the couple to post dailynews, updates and photos for awide circle of family andfriends without placing addi-tional demands on hospitalstaff or interfering with the mother's need to rest. Mehringalso attached an online guest-book that allowed visitors torespond to the posts and sendthe family messages of supportand encouragement. Sadly, Brighid passed away after nine days at Children'sHospital in St. Paul, Minn. Atthat point, the website becamethe medium for Joann and Dar-rin (last names intentionallyomitted) to convey their heart-breaking loss without having torehash the events over and overagain. On the basis of the over- whelming response, bothMehring and the grieving cou-ple realized similar websitescould benefit other parents ofcritically ill children or evenadults facing a medical crisis.Today, through the help of amemorial fund created inBrighid's memory, Children'sHospital in St. Paul providescomputer and Internet accessfor patients and families wish-ing to create their own onlinecommunities. \"The night their baby was born, so was the first Caring-Bridge site,\" Mehring recalls.\"That first experience was soamazing \u2014 not only lettingpeople know what was goingon, but being able to use tech-nology to connect people. Weknew that this was somethingthat anyone in a serious healthcondition could use. Joann andDarrin were instrumental in saying that this was a servicethat was so helpful that it need-ed to be available to others. Itwas one of those life events thatwe knew could be used to helpother people.\" Now, 10 years later, Caring- Bridge.org is a nonprofit webservice that connects familyand friends during periods ofcritical illness, treatment orrecovery. The service is free,private and available 24 hours aday, seven days a week. Duringthe last decade, 70,000 familieshave created personalized web-sites. The site has logged morethan 400 million visits, andmore than 10 million messagesof support have been entered inCaringBridge guestbooks. Indi-viduals from more than 40countries have used the onlinecommunication tool. \"Even though we are con- necting 250,000 people a day,we are still only at the tip of theiceberg. Most people onlyknow about CaringBridge byword of mouth. It's been verygrassroots, but what we arestriving to do is make sure thateveryone that is in this type ofsituation knows about the ser-vice,\" says Mehring, recog-nized by MSN.com as one ofthe nation's leading womenworking for change. She is amember of the MinnesotaCouncil of Nonprofits and theNational Health Council. Mehring says she designed CaringBridge: Keeping families, friends connected during medical crises A friend's high-risk pregnancy inspires the creation of an online tool now providing support and encouragement to thousands of families The brief life of Baby Brighid, who died nine days after being born premature, led to the creation and eventual expansion of the CaringBridge website.Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 13the site to allow even the most technologically unsavvy ofindividuals to build and person-alize a weblog (blog). Websitescan be completed in three easysteps. \"We hear over and over again people saying thank you formaking CaringBridge so easy,\"she says. \"That is one of ourprimary core values. Caring-Bridge is very easy to use, andyou don't have to know a lotabout technology \u2014 the sitedoes that for you.\" She adds, \"I think this service should be prescribed to anyonefacing a serious health condi-tion because being connectedto your friends and family isthat important. It's not only forthe person who is dealing withthe illness but also for theircaregivers and loved ones.\" One counselor's firsthand experience Counseling Today first learned about CaringBridgethrough Brooke Collison, a for-mer president of the American Counseling Association. Hedescribed a wonderful tool thathis close friend was using dur-ing his fight with an aggressiveform of cancer. The website,Collison said, was allowing hislongtime colleague, ReeseHouse, to stay in touch with hismany friends across the nation. House, a distinguished leader in the counseling profession,died peacefully in his home onSept. 10 (see page 44). But sev-eral weeks before he passedaway, House shared with Coun- seling Today how CaringBridge had helped him as he faced hisillness. \"I was diagnosed with head and neck cancer in February2006 and began both radiationand chemo treatments a littleafter that. I had heard aboutCaringBridge through a friendand checked it out. (I) thendecided to create my own siteand use it as a way of keepingfolks informed,\" he said.At the time of the interview, House was in good spirits, buthe knew the toughest timeswere still ahead. \"The dramacontinues as the process of can-cer treatments and care are stillwith us,\" he said. \"My Guthrie and dothis (CaringBridge) because wehave various networks offriends around the U.S. andbeyond. This seemed like agood way of getting informa-tion out and not having torepeat the same thing over andover. Partially, it is efficiencyand, partially, a way of decid-ing what you want to sharewith others. Frankly, I am a lit-tle surprised that I decided todo this, as I am not a personthat particularly likes to leteveryone know exactly what isgoing on all of the time. How-ever, it just seemed to me thattransparency was the mostimportant thing here.\" This transparency was also a surprise to some of his closestfriends, including Collison, who says the blog allowedHouse to open up more tofriends and family about hiscondition and medical treat-ments. \"He was a very privateperson,\" Collison says, \"butwhen he started writing on thewebsite, it was like a spiderweb out into the counselingcommunity. He was very hon-est about his physical condi-tion, and he could draw sup-port from all the people leav-ing messages of encourage-ment to him.\" One of the website's most beneficial aspects, Collisonadds, is that individuals whoare going through a medicalcrisis can provide updates ontheir condition in a single postinstead of having to repeatthemselves. From a counselor'spoint of view, he notes, thislessens some of the emotionalburden of sharing bad news. \"CaringBridge provides an electronic means of being openabout your condition and then permitting caring people to beresponsive or supportive \u2014much like what good counsel-ing enables,\" Collison says. \"Inthis electronic age, it's a way tobe in touch and to be in supportfor people in personally diffi-cult times. Counselors can takea lesson from CaringBridgeand should look for ways to usethe same mechanisms in otherhuman service areas.\" \"No one has complained to us about this website,\" Housesaid during his interview.\"Everyone seems to love it, useit and appreciate it. I am surethere are those who have differ-ent opinions, but if so, theyhave kept that to themselves.You know it is there; peopleuse it if they want to. And Imust tell you, there are thosewho cannot say enough timeshow important it is to them.One feature is that you can be Continued on page 45Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 14 Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 15House Education and Labor Committee releases draft bill for NCLB The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is five and a halfyears old and due for an update.As the first session of the 110thCongress enters the home-stretch, the House Educationand Labor Committee hasreleased a preliminary proposalto reauthorize NCLB.

ACA is pleased to report that committee staff included theterm \"specialized instructionalsupport personnel\" in Title I ofthe draft bill. As part of itsNCLB recommendations, ACAand other pupil services groupsurged Congress to adopt \"spe-cialized instructional supportpersonnel\" as the single term tobe used in all education lawsthat reference these personnel.Services provided by these per-sonnel are currently titled\"pupil services\" Elemen-tary and \"related services\" inthe Individuals with Disabili-ties Education Act. Establishing one common statutory term would ease con-fusion and more accuratelyreflect the nature and purposeof the services that these pro-fessionals provide to studentsin schools. The draft legisla-tion's definition of \"specializedinstructional support person-nel\" includes school coun-selors, school social workers,school nurses, librarians andschool psychologists. The defi-nition does not include non-school-based mental health care specialists. Unfortunately, the draft leg- islation's Title II section, whichdeals with professional devel-opment for school personnel,does not include a mention ofspecialized instructional sup-port personnel. ACA and othergroups had recommended thatthe term be included through-out Title II to better coordinatetraining and professional de-velopment of these personnelwith teachers and principals/administrators. ACA is encour-aging the committee to addressthis issue in the next iterationof the legislation. The House Education and Labor Committee was sched-uled to mark up a bill to renewNCLB the week of Sept. 24,with a vote on the House floorlater in the fall.

I just really wanted tohelp other women and couples to gothrough the grieving process,\" she says.Using therapeutic rituals, Thomas guidescouples as they grieve not only for thebaby they lost, but also for their dreamsof what they thought their future wouldbe like with that child. \"Couples experiencing one or more miscarriage often have the same emo-tional experience as those couples thathave difficulty conceiving \u2014 the samesense of loss of control, helplessness anddesperation,\" she says. \"It's a biological,psychological, social and spiritual crisisthat affects all aspects of an individualand couple's functioning.\" Individual, shared reactions Most counselors know that men and women experience and cope with deathdifferently, but Thomas says these reac-tions must be explained and presented tothe couple as normal. Reactions to the loss may also differ because of personalcoping styles, initial levels of desire tohave a child and cultural beliefs. Some common reactions among wom- en include: IDepression IHigher levels of distress IA sense of loss of control IGuilt/blaming themselves ITalking constantly about the loss IReaching out for social support from friends or family Common reactions among men include: IBuffering themselves against feelings of powerlessness and uncertainty ITending not to speak of the loss IRationalizing IPursuing action or wanting to tryagain too soonSilent Sorrow Continued from page 1 IEngaging in denial and distance or avoiding their partner IFeeling helpless that they cannot fixthe problem IBlaming their partner Together, couples may experience an- ger, shock or disbelief. Thomas says cou-ples may withdraw from friends or fami-ly members who have children and willcommonly go through spiritual question-ing \u2014 \"Why did this happen to us?\" \"Arewe not good enough to be parents?\" \"IsGod punishing us?\" \"The spiritual aspect, to me, is so sig- nificant no matter what the religiousbackground,\" Thomas says. \"You have tomake sense of the loss spiritually. Youhave to figure out how this fits into yourstory as a couple. It's about helping themmake sense of what has happened andstrengthening them as a couple.\" She notes that an early pregnancy loss changes the relationship permanently. Ifone or both of the individuals avoid thegrieving process, she cautions that it canparalyze the couple's ability to commu-nicate and problem solve effectively. Italso may hinder sexual intimacy andenjoyment. \"They often find themselves stuck and unable to move on. They need to recog-nize and validate their loss and find a wayto say goodbye to their dream of havingthis particular baby,\" Thomas says. \"Oncea woman finds out that she is pregnant,that emotional attachment begins. Theystart thinking about what their baby willbe like, the child's future and how thebaby will interact within the family.\" Sheadds that if the couple has seen their babyon a sonogram or heard the heartbeat, thesense of loss is even greater, yet they areleft with only a fuzzy black-and-whitephoto or a hospital bracelet as proof ofwhat they once had.Helping couples grieve To help couples move through the grieving process, Thomas suggests mark-ing the loss of the child with a \"life-cycleritual,\" a planned set of actions acknowl-edging the passing of the baby. The ritualprovides couples the chance to collabo-rate and construct a symbolic experienceto reflect on their loss and share their vul-nerabilities with each other. The processof designing the ritual can foster commu-nication, understanding and a sense ofpeace within the couple, Thomas says. \"When creating a ritual experience, it is important to ask the couple if this issomething they desire to do,\" she says.\"You can suggest that it has been helpfulto other couples who have experienced anearly loss. This discussion can then leadto determining what the couple needsmost from the experience.\" The counselor's role in this process is to listen to each partner's story about his orher loss and identify individual and rela-tional strengths and coping skills,Thomas says. These strengths can then beused to help the couple create their ownritual. She suggests having each partner explore the following questions: IWhat individual strengths have helped you cope with losses in the past? IWhat individual strengths do you pos-sess that get you through difficult times? IWhat are three of your strongest assets as a couple that have helped you through life challenges? Thomas offers suggestions for each step of the creation process if couples arereceptive to the idea of creating aritual. Valorie Thomas poses for a family portrait with her husband, Donald, and only son, John Michael. Thomas struggled for years to have children but now uses that experience to help other couples through the trauma of pregnancy loss.

IValidates the existence of their baby IMarks the pregnancy as real IMarks the passing of the child IAllows the couple to move on IAllows the couple to come to terms with their early pregnancy loss What do you hope to gain from the experience?

What doeseach symbolize? IAppointment card ISonogram photo IMother's journal ICandle IBaby blanket, toy or clothing IA family article, photo or cultural item IReligious jewelry or trinket Step 3: Creating the symbolic action or gesture to be carried out during the ritual What actions speak to you as a couple as a form of recognizing the loss?(Through this action, Thomas says, acouple can connect themselves, theirpartner, and their family and friends totheir baby.) ILighting a candle IPlaying a song IReading a letter composed by the par- ents to the baby IReading a poem IPlanting a tree or flower Step 4: Creating a specific plan The counselor should ask the following questions to help the couple preparelogistically for the ritual. IHow will the event take place? IWhen will it occur? will it be performed? IWho will be present? IWho will contact family members and friends (if included)? IHow will the ritual be concluded? Thomas adds that some couples may choose to involve close family membersand friends, while other may decide toperform the ritual privately. The couplealso needs to consider the possibility thatsome family members may not be recep-tive to the idea of a life-cycle ritual anddiscuss how to cope if that occurs. \"Theyneed to be selective when choosing whowill be there and who will be the mostsupportive of them,\" Thomas says. Sheadds that by discussing and exploring thecouple's preferences while designing theritual, counselors can also help them usetheir individual and relational strengthsand guide them as they mend their bondwith each other. Thomas notes that some couples may want to conduct a ritual but not plan outall the specific details. \"They may justhave an idea, but they don't know whenthey will be ready to actually do the ritu-al,\" she says. \"It may be a spontaneousevent that they share when the time isright. It will happen when they are ready.They are in therapy to move forward, sojust allow them to evolve. It's importantnot to push them.\" After the ritual After the ritual experience, Thomas says it is important for counselors toexplore how things may have changed forthe couple. She suggests asking the fol-lowing questions: IWhat has changed between the two of you as a result of creating this ritual together? IWhat have you learned about yourself and the way you grieve? IWhat have you learned about yourpartner? IWhat strengths have you becomeaware of in yourself and in your part- ner as a result of this experience?IWhat do you think your baby would say to you now that you have honored and remembered him or her? \"This is usually a pretty powerful ses- sion,\" she says. \"This experience hashelped them create or rewrite their storyas a couple. They came in with onestory, not knowing what to do with thisloss, and they leave with an understand-ing of how this event fits into their story.It has a special place within their livesand relationship.\" Helping a couple or individual address issues through the use of their \"story\" isthe primary technique used in narrativetherapy. Like Thomas, Donna Gibson,president of the Association for Assess-ment in Counseling and Education, hasused narrative therapy in the past whenhelping couples through the grief of earlypregnancy loss. Several years ago, Gibson moved out of state and, because of the lack of licensureparity, needed to complete an additionalinternship. She chose to work with a griefcounselor specifically assigned to a hos-pital maternity ward. This position is rare,Gibson says, because most hospitalsemploy few grief counselors, and thosethat do usually assign these counselors tothe hospital as a whole rather than desig-nating them for one specific area. \"I worked with a counselor who was only seeing couples who had either lost achild preterm, had stillbirths or had madethe decision to terminate the pregnancydue to genetic complications. We alsoworked with couples who were experienc-ing infertility,\" says Gibson, now a coun-selor educator at the University of SouthCarolina. \"It was a very enlightening ex-perience because I never before had dealtwith that level of grief. It was stressful attimes because we were considered a front-line person responding to the family.\" Gibson describes narrative therapy as a postmodern form of treatment in whichthe individual or couple directs the courseof counseling and how they interpret thestruggles with which they are dealing.Through this storytelling, she says, cou-ples can come to terms with their loss andforge a stronger relationship with eachother. \"I have them tell me their dreams they had for this baby \u2014 all the details. Thehumor they first found (when they learned of the pregnancy) and, now, thesadness they are experiencing. They tellme their story and talk about all of theseaspects in the dreams that they created,\"Gibson says. \"Then I help them rewrite orretell the story focusing on the presentand how this has changed their lives. It'simportant to get them to recognize thattheir dream has to be modified, not neces-sarily lost, even though they lost the baby.The dream can still live if it's modified,and they are the ones to modify it.\" Gibson adds that miscarriages and early pregnancy losses are not thatuncommon, but many couples suffer pri-vately because the subject is painful totalk about or because many people con-sider it taboo to discuss such issues asinfertility. \"The problem is that we don'ttalk about it in our society,\" she says. \"Ascounselors, we need to be comfortabletalking about this.\" Barb Fehrman has made it her job to get comfortable discussing the subject.After her pregnancy complications, shedecided to change careers and become aLicensed Professional Counselor dedicat-ed to helping couples cope with loss andinfertility. The private practitioner usesher experiences with fertility drugs, injec-tions, insemination procedures and preg-nancy losses, and her eventual successes,to connect with clients. Coming from a large Roman Catholic family, Fehrman says her pregnancy com-plications shattered the family portrait shehad envisioned. The lack of support shefelt during her own grieving process moti-vated her to become a counselor in thisfield. She says it's important for couplesto talk about what has happened anddecide how they want to mark the loss andsignificant dates associated with the loss,such as the baby's original due date andMother's Day. She encourages couples touse whatever medium seems natural tothem, be it journaling, preparing a ritual,painting or any other creative expression,and then helps them follow through withthe grieving process. I Angela Kennedy is a senior writer at Counseling Today . Contact her at akennedy@counseling.org. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orgConsidering family and friends American Counseling Association member Valorie Thomas provides the follow- ing suggestions to help couples communicate with family and friends after a preg-nancy loss. IFriends and family usually respond well to a specific request when they other- wise wouldn't know what to say or do. Let others know that you need help. IRespect your need to talk and be heard, and choose good listeners who careabout you. It is vital that you reach out to others during this sad time. IPlan how you will phrase your loss to colleagues and acquaintances in a simple, brief manner. Respect your need to decline discussing details you don't want to share. IConsider telling those close to you who are pregnant or have small children that it will be difficult for you to socialize with them for a while. If you feel it is too difficult to attend celebrations, send your regrets. Relatives and friends who carefor you will probably understand. In addition, the following suggestions can be offered to the couple's family and friends:IAcknowledge their sorrow and validate their feelings. IGive them permission to express their grief. ILet the couple know it is OK for them to be sad and express their feelings around you. This will allow them to grieve naturally. IOffer support by asking if there is anything you can do. For example, providemeals or help with the care of their other children. IAsk if it is OK for you to check on them periodically.

IBe aware that being around children or someone who is pregnant may be verydifficult for the couple at this time.

Each candidate was asked to provide information for four questions. Thismonth, they answer two of those ques-tions. In the November issue, theiranswers to the two remaining questionswill be featured. Complete information for all four can- didates, including biographical informa-tion and goals statements, will be fea-tured in the December issue of Counsel- ing Today . That issue will also include biographical information and goalsstatements for those participating inelections for ACA divisions and regions. Editor's note: The following informa- tion is printed as it was submitted fromthe candidates. Counseling Today has edited only for spelling and minor styleissues. There are still thousands of coun- selors who are not members of theAmerican Counseling Association.How would you reach this broad-based, specialty-driven population? A. Michael Hutchins: Relationships are critical in our profession. Under myleadership, ACA will expand currentrelationships and use our advocacy/multicultural competencies to providetraining for mental health professionalsand others on local and state levels. Wewill increase working with our own divi-sions and regions to build stronger rela-tionships. I will invite colleagues fromacross disciplines to join us in open dis-cussions of difficult issues exploring awide range of worldviews. We will col-laboratively publish the results of thesediscussions. Under my leadership, ACA will become actively associated with ahumanitarian cause. I will further devel-op public policy and legislative training for helping professionals to furtherensure parity and the quality of mentalhealth services on all levels. With theassistance of our insurance carrier, theACA Foundation and other entities, wewill publish online and hard copy publi-cations which provide specific skilltraining and other articles of interest tohelping professionals. We speak of graduate students as being our greatest resource. I will buildupon graduate student ideas and energyto move forward in areas such as tech-nology, diversity and connectednesswith other professions. Finally, I willsupport real-time and virtual confer-ences and meetings involving other pro-fessional associations and colleaguesacross disciplines. Lynn E. Linde: In order to reach pro- fessional counselors who are still notmembers of ACA, the question mustfirst be asked: Why haven't they joined?We must first look at the needs of thisgroup and determine what resources andservices they would find invaluable andthen use that information to tailor amembership outreach campaign. ACAmust be viewed as being in the forefrontof professional counseling and the mem-bership benefits invaluable in one'spractice setting. This may mean chang-ing the way we package membershipand offering more of a menu approach tobenefits. Members would then be able toselect additional services and resourcesthat best meet their needs. ACA needsimmediate name recognition; gettingthere requires a marketing campaign andoutreach efforts so both counselors andthe public know what ACA is and does. A second method of reaching non- members is through personal contact.Most of us joined the associationbecause someone invited us to becomeinvolved \u2014 and, so, we became en-gaged. We need to continue our person-al outreach efforts to nonmembers toinvite them to participate at the grass-roots, state or national levels, so they too will see the value of belonging to ACAand its entities. Marcheta P. Evans: Over the past several years, the leadership of this asso-ciation has worked actively to addressthe issues of declining membership.Through the development of surveys,focus groups and hiring of membershipspecialists to investigate the cause of thisshift, a multitude of reasons has beenreported for this decrease. The questionposed is, can we realistically be allthings to all professional counselors? Ibelieve we must meet the needs of ourbroad-based, specialty membership bytackling the issue of declining member-ship through multiple creative approach-es. These ideas range from includingmembership payment options over time,discounts for multiple-year commit-ments and recruitment of members, andnew marketing strategies of the profes-sion via commercials. We must have a product or experience that our membership finds valuable \u2014one that can meet the needs regardless ofspecialization. We can no longer expectindividuals to join just because their pro-fessors told them to join. Yes, our coun-selor education programs are a criticalcomponent to our success. These pro-grams instill a value of professionalinvolvement, but we must find ways tokeep the counselors once they are a partof our association by giving them areturn on their investments of time andresources. ACA can be that one profes-sional voice for all professional counsel-ing, regardless of specialization. Michael C. Lazarchick: The majority of members join because someone askedthem. Those that stay find value. I joinedwhen a professor passed out member-ship applications. After 30 years of con-ventions, my network includes thou-sands of counselors. Conferences arerejuvenating. Attending workshops orpresenting or just conversing expandsknowledge. Do you not find comfort in the fact that colleagues with varied inter-ests take actions on committees and indivisions or regions? Their work bene-fits all counselors personally and profes-sionally. ACA provides the forum thatbrings these people together. Numberstranslate into lower group insurancerates and a louder voice with legislators. That message, and the messages from all the others who find value, needs to beshared. I would further develop our mar-keting plan and teach members how torecruit. I would seek to expand ROAR,which rewards members for their efforts,because a primary purpose of ACA is touse its resources to serve members.Holding the belief that participationenhances growth and breaks isolation, Ihave taken the responsibility to recruitnew members. In return, I have receivedcountless testimonials confirming thattruth. Sometimes we have to take peopleby the hand to get them on the dancefloor. One of ACA's strategic priorities is public awareness. What methodswould you recommend to reach exter-nal constituencies (e.g., members ofCongress and identity-related groupssuch as AARP the Alliance on Men-tal Health)? Lynn E. Linde: ACA has made tremendous progress over the past 15 years in gaining recognition as anassociation for professional counselors.But there is still much that needs to bedone. A multifaceted approach utilizingmembers as well as the association is necessary to reach ACA's externalconstituencies. ACA needs to continue its marketing campaign until we have visibility andname recognition. Additionally, we needto continue to develop collaborativerelationships with the media so thatACA is perceived as an expert resourceto be called upon and quoted when A. Michael Hutchins Lynn E. Linde Marcheta P. Evans Michael C. LazarchickCounseling oday IOctober 2007 19events happen or when infor- mation is needed. We need tocontinue to work with our sisterorganizations on topics of com-mon interest to solidify ourposition as representing animportant constituency. Thiswill require outreach on ourpart. We also need to continueour efforts at the local and statelevels. Members need supportin becoming more adept atmarketing themselves and theirprograms and gaining recogni-tion and public awareness forthose things they do. ACA mustalso provide support for coali-tion building at the local andstate levels. And, lastly, mem-bers must continue to increasetheir public policy efforts at thelocal and national levels. Marcheta P. Evans: There have been over the past severalyears wonderful initiatives de-veloped which need to be fur-ther explored to examine thelong-range impact on publicawareness. One such initiativeinvolved the development of acommercial highlighting theservices of counselors as pro-fessionals. It was aired in cer-tain markets, and I believe it to be a wonderful achievement forour profession. The communitywas impressed and saw thework of the profession. As withany attempt to operationalize astrategic plan, there is no oneset way to accomplish this pri-ority. The priority of publicawareness must be addressedthrough all types of print, tech-nology and personal interac-tions with the audiences inwhich the association must beengaged. These include enhancing the training of current membershipon grassroots public awarenessinitiatives and developing pro-fessional marketing strategieswhich specifically target suchgroups as members of Congress,AARP and the Alliance on Men-tal Health through print andvideo mediums, podcasts, web-casts and other technology-relat-ed forms of communication. Michael C. Lazarchick: External constituents or theircustomers have needs. Everytime we deliver a service orprovide information that ad-dresses one of these needs, weare elevating our image in public awareness. We need toprovide congressional staffwith information on issues thatwill help them prepare briefsfor their congressperson. Weneed to submit articles to theAARP Bulletin and similar publications on a regular basis,written by counselors, for gen-eral public consumption. Weneed to submit links to articleswritten by counselors that sup-port information found on factsheets published by theAlliance for Mental Health. Ofcourse, we need to use everytype of media outlet andunderstand that we are limitedonly by the extent of our imag-ination. How quickly wouldour penetration level rise inpublic consciousness Sirtis (Counselor Troi onStar Trek: The Next Genera-tion) made a public service announcement? Most important, we are among the most educated peo-ple on this planet and are in avery noble occupation. Weneed to share our knowledgeand skills at every opportunity.When we serve other humans,fight injustice, respond to tragedy and take actions to healour planetary community, weare creating our image in publicconsciousness. Hutchins: ACA collaborative relationshipswith many my leadership, ACA willcreate a networking map toexplore the next steps in coali-tion building. Using emergingtechnology, I will expand dia-logue with groups who havecommon concerns and passionsto share expertise, vision andstrategies. As ACA president, I will actively explore our emergingrelationships with worldwidecolleagues. Some of our enti-ties work collaboratively totrain counselors in other partsof the world. We must continueto do so. Working with theInternational Association forCounselling, I will encouragecollaborative visioning, partici-pation and action. We must share the energy and creativity of our graduatestudents and emerging profes-sionals by participating in col-laborative efforts across disci- plines.

Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 20 Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 21 Addressing Racism: Facilitating Cultural Competence in Mental Health and Educational Settings Edited by Madonna G. Constantine and Derald Wing Sue, 2006, John Wiley & Sons, 305 pages, $49.95 (paperback), ISBN 0-471-77997-0 This ambitious text tackles the perniciousand pervasive prob-lems of racism andother forms of op-pression in mentalhealth and school set-tings. Edited by twoof the most respected scholars and advocates in the field ofmulticultural counseling, this thought-provoking and perceptive book will findan appreciative audience among practi-tioners, students and counselor educa-tors. Given the intractable and deleteri-ous effects of racism and other oppres-sions in these settings, the contributingauthors respond by offering provocativeand enlightening depictions of the cur-rent state of affairs. They also provide awelcome collection of challenging yetrealistic suggestions to work toward theelimination of racism, sexism, classismand heterosexism. The book is divided into four sections: What Is Known About Racism, Racismin Mental Health Settings, Racism inEducational Settings and EradicatingRacism: Future Directions. These titlesare a touch misleading; in addition toaddressing racism, several of the chap-ters do an admirable job in discussing theintersections of various forms of oppres-sion. In addition, while six of the chap-ters are devoted to educational settings,the text seems more rewarding overallfor readers working in a counseling con-text, including school counselors. The tone throughout the text is forth- right. Derald Wing Sue opens the secondchapter by stating: \"In our society,Whiteness is a default standard ... Fromthis color standard, racial/ethnic minori-ties are evaluated, judged and oftenfound to be lacking, inferior, deviant orabnormal\" (p. 15). He then convincinglymakes the case that the invisibility ofWhiteness is linked to an often unin-tended support of the racist status quo byWhites. As is the case in each of the 14well-written chapters that follow, Suesprinkles in a generous dose of sugges-tions, insights and potential solutions tothe identified concerns and issues. Inthis case, that consists of outlining stepsneeded for Whites to effectively engagein the fight against the perpetuation ofthis insidious form of oppression. Most of the chapters offer content designed to enhance the reader's multi-cultural competence in each of three oft-cited domains. The authors invite reflec-tion and increased self-awareness ofone's own beliefs and behaviors, offervaluable knowledge on their topic andgive suggestions for improved skills andinterventions. The overall effect is an eminently worthwhile, readable and rel-evant contribution on an essential topic.Reviewed by Tim Grothaus, assistantprofessor and school counseling coordinator, educational leadership andcounseling, Old Dominion University. Handbook for Achieving Gender Equity Through Education, 2nd edition By Susan Klein (General Editor), Barbara Richardson, Dolores A. Grayson, Lynn H. Fox, Cheris Kramarae, Diane S. Pollard and Carol Anne Dwyer (editors), 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 768 pages, $295 (hard cover), $95 (paperback), ISBN 978-0805854541 The first edition of this published in1985 uses the terms\"gender into sixmajor parts: 1) FactsAbout the Nature and Value of Gender Equity, 2) Adminis-trative Strategies for Implementing Gen-der Equity, 3) General Educational Prac-tices for Promoting Gender Equity, 4)Gender Equity Strategies in the ContentAreas, 5) Gender Equity Strategies forDiverse Populations and 6) GenderEquity From Early Through Postsec-ondary Education. A disappointingomission in the new Handbook is its lack of attention to the significant workof counselors and counselor educators inthis area during the last 20-plus years;contributions of teachers, administratorsand parents are clearly specified. This second edition includes about 60 authors who write on various genderequity topics. Most have some familiari-ty with education and have written earli-er about the women's movement and thepsychology of gender. Many of theauthors are from academia and appear toregard empirical research as the onlypath to knowledge. Nevertheless, it wassurprising to find little in the volume on\"other ways of knowing,\" such as quali-tative research methodology, in a bookon this topic. While the enormous Handbook is not a volume one would sit down with and readcover to cover, it is a well-developedguide to the current state of gender equi-ty, especially in the United States. Theforeword is written by Eleanor Smeal,whose Feminist Majority Foundation wasa major sponsor of the project. The pref-ace is written jointly by Smeal and gener-al editor Susan Klein. The Handbook is quite expensive for personal purchase,but is appropriate for a library, media cen-ter or department. Klein points out that many societal and contextual changes since 1985 haveinfluenced present writers in this field.Some of these influences include the growth of the field of gender equity edu-cation, greater focus on global genderissues, more attention to the intersec-tions of gender and other educationalequity areas, increased attention to boysand men, more attention to Title IX andother gender equity laws, more govern-mental accountability in general (butless for gender equity) and more atten-tion to the gender equity needs ofdiverse populations. The volume identifies four major indi- cators of progress: 1) increased publicunderstanding and media attention relat-ed to gender equity in education, 2) theuse of U.S. gender equity laws (especial-ly Title IX to protect women and menfrom sex discrimination in education),3) decreases in gender gaps in educa-tional achievement tests formerly favor-ing men and boys and in educationalattainment and 4) some indication thatwomen's internalized barriers to suc-cess, such as low self-esteem or attribu-tions of success to luck, have decreased. The authors also identify persistent obstacles to achieving gender equity. Ina section on \"Conundrums,\" Klein asksseveral important questions, including: IWhat are appropriate and inappropri- ate strategies to address gender differences? ITo what extent can and should gov- ernment try to change education to eliminate sex stereotyping, discrimi-nation and stratification in a pluralis-tic society? IHow can education change values and rewards in society to promote gender equality? In the final chapter, a 12-page table summarizes \"Key Chapter Recommen-dations\" according to topical headings.This table provides a very convenientand useful end to a Handbook filled with questions and answers about significantgender issues in education and providesa good sense of closure, at least for thepresent, to a complex, important topic.Reviewed by Sunny S.

Moved by the Spirit: Discovery and Transformation in the Lives of Leaders By Jeffrey Kottler and Jon Carlson, 2007, Impact Publishers, 240 pages, $18.95, ISBN 987-1-886230-68-2 As deeply personal experiences, spiri- tual transformations define a person andhis/her life. Transformations alter anindividual's choices and outlook andchange the ways in which that personrelates to others. In this book, JeffreyKottler and Jon Carlson offer readersinsightful glimpses into the transformation ofspiritual leaders are a representative sample ofthose interviewed. The authors identify similarities of experience that divide the book into fourtheme-related sections: Guided Discov-ery, Painful Discovery, Risky Discoveryand Surprising Discovery. As I read through these chapters, I was deeply impressed by the spiritualityof these leaders. The passionate spirit ofeach individual shines through, espe-cially in their quoted words. Remark-ably, considering the great diversity ofthe group, all spoke with the sameintention. Whether a Bushman shaman,scholar or monk, each message placedgreat emphasis on creating purpose andmeaning. Although the words of those inter- viewed were powerful and evocative, Ifound myself distracted at times by edi-torial and typographical errors. Thecompelling meaning of each speaker'swords prevailed, however. These stories contain important reminders for counselors. As humans,we are unique, yet we share a yearningfor peace and well-being. As illustratedthrough the stories in Moved by the Spir- it, each person's path to peace is as var- ied as the individual who walks it. Ascounselors, we have opportunities tonurture the spiritual growth of thosewith whom we work and help them findmeaning and purpose. Moved by the Spirit provides a sam- pling of spiritual pathways. Merelyreading this book awakens the reader tolimitless possibilities, beyond the con-fines of traditional religion. At the end ofthe book, the authors provide simple, yetpotentially life-changing suggestions forincreasing spirituality. Through interviews, Kottler and Carl- son provide enlightening examples ofthe endless pathways to enhanced spiri-tuality. Each of the individuals inter-viewed provides an extraordinary exam-ple for following instincts and listeningto one's heart.Reviewed by Linde Murray, graduatestudent in counseling and humanresource development at South DakotaState University.

This quarterly report (summarizing April 1-June 30) repre-sents the fourth and final report for thefiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The balance sheet presented with this report is intended to reflect ACA's finan-cial position at a given point in time.This balance sheet gives a picture of theassociation's financial position as ofJune 30. As of June 30, ACA owned$7,542,401 in assets. Of these assets,$6,606,436 was in cash and investments. As of June 30, the association's liabil- ities included vendor fees of approxi-mately $273,039, staff salaries and ben-efits of $465,990 and fees collected onbehalf of related organizations of$60,890. Member benefits to be fulfilledtotaled $3,279,730 and appear as a lia-bility because ACA receives member-ship revenues annually while providingmember benefits monthly. As this balance sheet indicates, ACA's net worth on June 30 was $3,462,751,indicating that the association remainsfinancially healthy. However, efforts toensure the association's long-term sta- bility must continue. As of June 30, ACA reported $420,839 in excess revenues overexpenses. ACA's revenues are more than$595,345 higher than those reportedduring Fiscal Year 2006. Expensesincurred for FY 2007 were $251,364higher than those incurred last year.

Delegate Gisela Lin noted in her daily journal of the trip that, \"(A) main prob-lem is the lack of welfare and rewardsfor the elderly and senior citizens.\" Sheadds that many seniors suffer fromdepression and do not feel the support ofextended families that once played suchan important role before China institutedits one-child policy. She also says mem-bers of the one-child generation seem tolack persistence and are often irresponsi-ble. At the same time, she notes, the highlevel of academic pressure put on thesole offspring often leads young peoplein China to experience stress, addiction,depression and an unbalanced life. In retrospect On a personal level, Arredondo found visiting the Great Wall of China the mostmoving and memorable part of the trip.\"You see photos and documentaries onthe Great Wall of China, but it's just anincredible structure,\" she says. \"Andwhen you think about the fact that it wasbuilt centuries ago, it's really awesome.It leaves you speechless when you seehow it winds through the countrysideand mountains.\"Arredondo says the trip was both pro- fessionally and personally rewarding. \"Itwas an excellent journey, and I hope wecan do this again,\" she says. \"Bothplaces have so much to offer us.

Some want to know why life is unfair; others seek the meaning of life.How to put things together is importantto some, while others want to experienceraising a family or to see how enlighten-ment feels. I want the experience ofbeing a counselor educator who effec-tively conducts quality research andthinks scientifically. I want to know howto best invest myself in students, clients,research and the community. Deep downinside, is it possible that I even want tounderstand statistics? Finding a passion How did I discover that a Ph.D. was the path I wanted to take? I can break itdown into compartments to explain theprocess, but in reality, it was a discom-bobulated mess. Nothing was clear ordefined in the process. The decisionactually seemed to sneak up on me. I never had high academic goals. I studied for a bachelor's degree becausemy family expected it. I worked withjuveniles in a therapeutic residential set-ting, and I pursued a master's degree togain better hours and pay for what I wasalready doing. The decision to pursue a Ph.D. arrived in a very different way. Itdidn't rear its head because of immediatepractical pressures but was instead aresult of wrestling to understand myself. I once held hopes of being a deep, pro- found, hard-to-understand individual. Inreality, I am a pretty simple human beingwho needs a passion to fire me up. Whatdid I enjoy doing? When did I get lost inwork? What topics did I speak up aboutwith emotion and eloquence? What arti-cles was I drawn to in Counseling Today? These were the questions I need- ed to answer. Giving demonstrations, conducting role-plays and making presentations inmy master's program was great. I love toteach and come by it naturally \u2014 mymother taught eighth-grade history for39 years!

Ipolitely asked if he really wanted me.After all, I had listened to many panelsbut never spoken on one before. Wouldmy thoughts and experiences be of inter-est to any group of students? Indeed, the instructor wanted my com- munity mental health views represented,so one week later, I entered the class-room with six other panel members.Fear and trepidation were my main emo-tions. Would I single-handedly embar-rass the entire community mental healthprofession by saying something stupid,uninformed or (gasp!) politically incor-rect? Sitting at the end of the stage witha death grip on the chair, I looked for thequickest path out in the event that Iwould need to dart from the treacherousroom to secluded safety. A football play-er sat in the middle row, which immedi-ately raised irrational high school inse-curities of being a \"nerd.\" The instructor calmly asked us to introduce ourselves. The first panelist onthe opposite end of the stage breezilydescribed her experiences. Followingthe other five, I somehow managed todescribe my past experiences withoutvomiting, having no idea of what I actu-ally said. Being the last to introducemyself, it was also my job to ask themembers of the class if they had ques-tions. Of course, it had to be the footballplayer who raised his hand and askedperhaps the most important question \u2014one it too often seemed I had left unan-swered: \"What made you decide to get aPh.D.?\" I had wrestled with this question for the better part of seven months, bothbefore and after becoming a doctoralstudent, and it still lingers. The questionwas there in the morning after spendingan hour on the phone with the printerhelp line. It was there again as I stood over the dumpster looking at the printer,now in pieces. I asked myself the ques-tion in the office after the administrativestaff and most of the professors had gonehome for the evening and again on aMonday after putting in a 12-hour day. Itcame back on Tuesday after I sacrificedlunch to revise a paper. Wednesdaybrought the question up at a statisticsexam. It arose Thursday way past bed-time as I read articles about the benefitsof empirically based research. It re-turned Friday night as I was writing aterm paper. Rare is the day that I do not ask myself this question. One thing I have definite-ly discovered: Getting a Ph.D. is hard! Where answers appear I know the answer to why I am in a counselor education doctoral program,but I forget too frequently and need to bereminded. The question is silenced whenlife feels the most fulfilling. It is quietedwhen I sit in Starbucks surrounded byarticles discussing a topic of passion(instructors insist on calling it myresearch topic ). When I am working with my cohort to put together a posterpresentation for the American Counsel-ing Association, the question disappears.The overall rigor of the process is not ofconcern when I'm pondering the nexttopic to research, sitting in an office witha client, discussing professional matterswith students, sitting in supervision orwriting about a topic of interest. I thrivein those moments, forgetting about otherdemands. I am focused on living in thatinstant. These are the moments I feelmost alive. Clarity about my decision to continue my education comes when I realize thatnothing less will satisfy me. A Ph.D. iscertainly not the end-all-be-all. Rather, itis a vehicle to help raise and answerquestions. My colleagues all have ques-Fighting for a career fit Continued on page 43 Student Focus - BY K. ELIZABETH MCDONALD Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 26by family members, physicians, coun- selors and other helping professionals.\"Both family members and practitionerstend to look the other way or won't pressthe issue with older people,\" says McAl-ister, a Licensed Professional Counselorand member of ACA. \"The thinking goes,'If mother needs a little nip out of the bot-tle, so be it.' ... Stereotypes (about theelderly) may make caregivers, family orfriends reluctant to upset a loved one orgenerally accept some indicators (ofaddiction) as normal behavior. Falls, con-fusion and excessive sleeping might beviewed as typical of the elderly when thereal cause could be alcohol or misuse ofdrugs.\" According to statistics cited by McAlis- ter, between 12 and 17 percent of acutehospitalizations among the elderly aredue to adverse drug reactions; another 11to 20 percent are alcohol related. Andthose numbers are likely to rise as thebaby boomers age. There is speculation,McAlister says, that because of pastfamiliarity, many baby boomers will turnto alcohol and drugs, whether prescrip-tion, over-the-counter or illegal, to helpthemselves cope with the aging process. \"The baby boomers who led social upheaval in the sixties will begin to turn65 in 2011, and the result will be 22 mil-lion individuals over the age of 65,\" shesays. \"With increased age, there is alsoincreased vulnerability due to lifestylechoices. This is a generation that hasgrown up \u2014 and grown old \u2014 withgreater awareness and exposure to drugs,media advertisements ('Ask your doctorif _____ is right for you') and acceptanceof drug use. In addition, older adults aremore vulnerable to the effects of alcoholthan their younger counterparts.\" Greer, also an LPC in Texas, concurs with that assessment. \"The baby boomershave always tended to push the envelopeon alcohol and drugs, and, as they age,this is just a way of life. These behaviorstend to be more accepted by family mem-bers because that is just how Dad, Mom,Uncle Joe and Aunt Mary are, and no oneconfronts the behaviors. But as we age,our bodies react differently to various for-eign substances, and although the personmay have used alcohol and/or drugs dur-ing their life, through the aging processand, often, a greater intake of these sub-stances, it becomes a substance abuseissue.\" Getting a handle on the problem \"There is an increase of senior clients having difficulty with substance abuseand other process addictions,\" confirmsSimone Lambert, president of the Inter-national Association of Addictions andOffender Counselors, a division of ACA.\"Thus, counselors really need to be awareof how prevalent addictions are with theelderly population and broach topicssuch as substance usage and gamblingpatterns with their senior clients. As withmany populations, substance abuse in theelderly may be initially masked by a co-occurring disorder, such as depression, oreven misdiagnosed. It is imperative thatwe explore the role of alcohol or drugs inthe client's daily functioning. For instance, poor appetite or sleep difficul-ties may be the cause of substanceintake.\" While remaining tactful, counselors should be vigilant to the possibility ofolder adults struggling with addiction,Greer says. This starts by genuinely get-ting to know the client and asking how heor she copes with physical health prob-lems or traumatic events, she adds. \"Theelderly may be self-medicating with alco-hol or prescription drugs to combatdepression, loneliness or a sense ofdespair,\" Greer says. \"What may havestarted as a prescription for dealing withthe loss of a spouse or other traumaticevent becomes a crutch, but one that isnot readily recognized by others, includ-ing the family doctor. As we age, doctorsreadily prescribe medications to make thepain go away. The elderly often increasethe dosage to ensure the pain goes away, whether it is physical or emotional.\" McAlister says counselors should remain particularly alert for specific riskfactors that increase senior clients' likeli-hood of engaging in addictive behaviors.These risk factors include: IPrior history of alcohol or drug abuse IFamily history of substance abuse INew onset of medical problems ILoss of a spouse IRecent retirement ISocial isolation IChronic pain coupled with inadequatetreatment In addition, McAlister says, counselors should educate clients' family membersabout red flags that may indicate the needto screen for addiction. She cautions thatfamily members, friends and even help-ing professionals may be tempted to sim-ply chalk these warning signs up as natur-al effects of the aging process. Among thered flags: IPoor self-care INeglect of orinsomnia IBalance problems IErratic driving ILoss of memory IConfusion or disorientation IMood IFinancial problems \"When determining the need for assis- tance, the elderly will respond best whenasked about the recent past,\" McAlistersays. \"Embed alcohol-use questions inthe context of other health behaviors,such as exercise, weight, smoking anddiet. Pay attention to nonverbal cues thatsuggest the client is minimizing use. Forexample, blushing, turning away, fidget-ing, looking at the floor or a change inbreathing pattern.\" Offering treatment Sometimes, senior clients' problems with prescription or over-the-counterdrugs are related to a lack of organizationor information, and counselors can playan important role in teaching them to advocate for themselves and develop asafe routine for taking medications (seesidebar on page 27). In other instances,counselors must help older adults get tothe root problem of an addiction. \"For some clients, there will be a need to enter a rehabilitation facility and detoxbefore other interventions can be used,\"Greer says. \"Some recent research showsthat the number of those with addictionsover age 60 are increasing but, likewise,they tend to respond quickly to recovery.Also, for some elderly clients, it is impor-tant for them to recognize who they areand their accomplishments as opposed towhat they are not \u2014 to do away with thedeficit model.\" \"We must always treat all clients with respect, but this becomes increasinglyimportant with the senior client,\" shecontinues. \"For so many seniors, lifebecomes about loss \u2014 loss of hair, teeth,eyesight, loved ones, friends \u2014 and thecounselor can help the senior client retainor gain a sense of belonging and beingneeded by others. To help combat alco-holism, drug addiction and other addic-tive behaviors, seniors need an emotionalretirement plan so they feel worth, digni-ty and a reason to be.\" ACA member Merry Evenson, profes- sor emeritus at Texas Woman's Universi-ty, lists several tasks for treatment inworking with elderly clients who are con-fronting an addiction. These include: IInstilling a sense of accountability IInstilling a sense of responsibility IHelping them develop alternative ways of self-motivating and delay-ing gratification IHelping them develop an ability toself-soothe in healthier ways (such astaking the dog for a walk, taking abath, listening to music) IHelping them identify cognitive distortions IHelping them recognize how theiraddiction seduces them Among the approaches she has found effective are cognitive behavioral treat-ment and motivational interviewing.\"Treatment needs to focus on both thesenior client and their family wheneverpossible to be the most effective,\" addsEvenson, an LPC and Licensed Marriageand Family Therapist who maintains aprivate practice. \"Because of the level ofdenial and shame, the more sides to thestory that are involved, the better.\" Lambert agrees. \"Obtaining a release to speak with family members and medicaldoctors can strengthen the treatment plan and increase the level of support theclient has throughout the recoveryprocess,\" she says. \"And when referringsenior clients to a self-help group as anadditional source of support, counselorsneed to inquire about the demographicsof the group to ensure that elderly clientscan feel comfortable with others of simi-lar age, preventing further isolation.\" Because isolation and loneliness often lend themselves to addictive behaviors,socialization plays an integral role intreatment, counselors emphasize. \"Astheir world shrinks \u2014 their spouse orfriends die, they're no longer working \u2014it becomes really important to them tohave that social outlet,\" McAlister says. Colliding trends Of course, the catch-22 is that some social outings tailored specifically forseniors can likewise encourage addictivebehaviors. As examples, McAlisterpoints to wine-tasting nights at assistedliving communities, retirement seminarsthat offer free drinks and bus trips thattake senior adults to casinos. The last example, in particular, has grabbed Evenson's attention. \"It's thecolliding of two big trends \u2014 grayingand gambling,\" she says. While the over-all popularity of gambling has explodedin the past three decades, Evenson citesstatistics that show retirees now accountfor 34 percent of all casino gamblers.According to stats provided by the Amer-ican Gambling Association in 2001, shesays the number of casino visits by seniorcitizens has doubled since 1975, a ratethat far surpasses any other age group. And Evenson contends those numbers didn't happen merely by chance. Thegambling industry recognized that olderadults were a growing segment of theU.S. population, she says, and set out tocapitalize on that trend. Evenson explains that casinos use a variety of marketing techniques to enticethe elderly, including hiring performersfrom the \"Golden Oldies\" era and offer-ing perks such as free drinks, cheap mealsand coupons for popular medications.Many of the promotions coincide withdates when Social Security or pensionchecks arrive, she says, and casinos some-times offer kickbacks to retirement centeremployees who organize bus trips forsenior citizens to these gambling meccas.The casinos also do whatever they can tomake themselves readily accessible tothose with limited mobility, she says. Senior Addiction Continued from page 1 iStockphotomagazine salespersons or telephone solic- itors or offers of false sweepstakes win-nings, no one wants the elderly to be luredinto settings that appear harmless \u2014 areeven referred to as 'day cares for the elder-ly' \u2014 but eventually lead to losses of theirlife savings and full-blown addictions.\" Men are more likely to get addicted to gambling, says Evenson, who points outthat a gambling addiction is determinednot by the frequency or the amount ofmoney wagered but rather the continu-ance of the behavior despite repeated neg-ative consequences. At the same time, shesays, \"Gambling is one of the most high-ly addictive of the activities or substancesbecause it offers intermittent reinforce-ment. The thing that makes gamblingexciting is the money involved and theplayer's hope for gain. One of the secretsof gambling is that it combines chancewith risk.\" On top of this, she says, manyelderly persons are lonely and view gam-bling as \"cheap\" and safe entertainmentthat provides a social outlet, making themparticularly vulnerable to addiction.More health care professionals need to start screening clients \u2014 young and old\u2014 for gambling addictions, Evensonsays. Beyond that, counselors should takesteps to help older adults identify socialoutlets, promotions and pleasure-seekingalternatives of a healthier nature, she says.More counselors should also considerproviding services and groups to theelderly to assist them in dealing with theproblems that make them long to\"escape\" through gambling or the use ofalcohol and drugs, Evenson says. Thesecounseling services should addressseniors clients' loneliness, financial con-cerns, unresolved grief and issues fromtheir past, she advises. I Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 27 Jonathan Rollins is the editor-in-chief of Counseling Today . Contact him at jrollins@counseling.org. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orgLikewise, Evenson says, slot machines and other electronic gaming machines(EGMs) tend to be set up with the elderly\u2014 particularly elderly women \u2014 in mind.The machines are designed for ease of use,allowing gamblers to play by pushing abutton instead of pulling a lever and allow-ing them to insert credit cards instead ofcoins. According to Evenson, femaleproblem gamblers have described EGMgambling as a way to \"escape,\" numb theiremotions and manage their moods, muchlike with the use of alcohol or drugs.On the surface, organized bus trips to casinos seem like a \"safe way to be bad\"for many senior citizens, but if you digdeeper, Evenson says, the truth is oftenmore sinister. \"These look like great tripsthat provide a social outlet and freemeals,\" she says, \"but they can lead togambling and alcohol addictions and cancost these individuals their nest eggs. ...Counselors need to be aware of this infor-mation, and they need to actually be advo-cates for the elderly. Just as no one wantsthe elderly to be taken advantage of by In conducting research, Licensed Professional Counselor Gay McAlisterhas found that the elderly consume 25to 30 percent of all prescription drugsin the United States. Approximately 85percent of elderly Americans take atleast one prescription daily, and sepa-rate studies have indicated that, onaverage, those 65 and older take any-where from five to 11 different pre-scription medications daily. Likewise, 87 percent of elderly Americans use at least one over-the-counter remedy daily, with almost 6percent saying that they use five ormore over-the-counter drugs. Accord-ing to McAlister, a counselor educatorat Southern Methodist University,among the drugs most frequentlyabused by the elderly are analgesics,cardiovascular medications, laxatives,vitamins and antacids. While McAlister tries to draw atten- tion to the increasing numbers of olderadults becoming addicted to prescrip-tion and over-the-counter drugs, that isnot her only concern. As she pointsout, 90 percent of elderly individualsexperience adverse effects from takingdrugs, often because they're mixingand matching medications or trying toself-medicate to save money. \"Thisalso means they're self-diagnosing,\"she says. \"And (mixing drugs) oftencancels out the good effects of theirother medications.\" Many older adults are at risk of mis- using over-the-counter and prescrip-tion drugs for a number of says, including: ISeeing multiple specialists IHoarding expired medications ISharing medications with a spouseor loved one IMixing medications IIncorrectly following directions fortaking the drugs IForgetting that they've alreadytaken their daily dosage (or haveyet to take it) IBeing misdiagnosed by medicalprofessionals Adverse reactions related to misuse (or abuse) of drugs may go unnoticedby family members or be wronglyattributed to the aging process,McAlister adds.Here again, counselors can play a critical role in helping elderly clients.McAlister recommends that counselorsuse the \"brown bag\" approach to moreaccurately determine medication use.\"Ask the client to bring a brown paperbag containing all prescribed and over-the-counter medications, including anyherbal treatments, that they are current-ly taking,\" she explains. \"This providesan opportunity to assess the numberand types of medications, the numberof prescribing providers who workwith the client and the need for discus-sion among care providers and thefamily.\" McAlister also suggests that counselors: IEncourage elderly clients to use asingle pharmacy for all prescrip-tions and to engage the pharmacyin dialogue IEncourage clients to have one primary care physician review alltheir medications, including over-the-counter and herbal remedies IEncourage clients to keep a med-ical log or journal and share it withtheir physician IEncourage clients to advocate for themselves by staying in-formed and asking questions aboutmedications IEncourage clients to take medica-tions coinciding with daily activi-ties (such as watching the eveningnews) IStress the need for pill organizers(organized by day or by week)with clients and their families ISolicit more family support forthese clients IObtain a thorough medical historyand assessment of these clients IShow genuine care and interest andlisten carefully to pick up on issuesthat may push these clients toengage in addictive behaviors Counselors should also raise overall awareness about drug misuse andaddictions among the elderly by edu-cating the general public, caregivers,other mental health professionals andphysicians, McAlister says. \"Aware-ness, communication and a teamapproach is critical,\" she emphasizes. I \u2014 Jonathan RollinsConcerns other than addictionCounseling T oday IOctober 2007 28 Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 29Attendees of the 2008 American Counseling Association Annual Confer-ence & Exposition, taking place March26-30 in Honolulu, will have the oppor-tunity to earn as many as 35 hours ofcontinuing education (CE) credits byattending both days of the preconferenceLearning Institutes and all three days ofthe main part of the conference. How does this work? The preconfer- ence Learning Institutes are offered dur-ing daytime sessions as well as in theevenings, allowing attendees to earnnine hours of CE credits daily. Forexample, if you attend one daytimeLearning Institute (which will run from8 a.m.-3:30 p.m.) and then go to anotherone that evening (from 4:30-7:45 p.m.,)you would earn nine hours for the day.Daytime Learning Institutes offer sixhours of CE credit, while the eveningsessions offer three hours. With two fulldays of Learning Institutes March 26-27, you can earn 18 hours of CE creditsbefore the conference even begins. Then, if you attend Education Ses-sions throughout the day on each day of the main part of the conference (March28-30), you can earn as many as 17hours of additional CE credits. In lessthan one week's time, you may be ableto earn all or most of the credits youneed for licensure renewal, dependingon your state's requirements. Of course,many counseling professionals who donot need CE credits enroll in LearningInstitutes simply for the professionaldevelopment and skills building thatthese intensive, in-depth sessions offer. The complete schedule for Learning Institutes is posted on the ACA websiteand included in the Advance Registra-tion Brochure, which members willreceive in early October. Attendees canchoose from 39 Learning Institutes attwo levels \u2014 Introductory and Ad-vanced \u2014 and from more than 500 Edu-cation Sessions. ACA offers the preconference Learn- ing Institutes to enable attendees to earnadditional CE credits while gaining in-depth knowledge in a particular area. ACA Conference & Expo is a bonanza of CE credits ACA advises prospective registrants to register early because sessions do fill upand sometimes get closed out. A separate registration fee for the pre- conference Learning Institutes rangesfrom $70 to $135 for ACA memberswho register before Nov. 30. Nonmem-ber general attendees pay $185 for day-time sessions and $145 for evening ses-sions. Reduced rates apply for students,new professionals and retirees.

Similarly, is thereanyone who has never stressed out \u2014 even a little bit \u2014 aboutwhat they're going to wear? Take a couple of minutes to assess your current wardrobe.At this very moment, do youhave in your closet an outfit thatwould be appropriate for: IA job interview ILunch or dinner with a business associate IA funeral IA cocktail party IA sports outing (either as aparticipant or a spectator)with colleagues Stacy and Clinton, Trinny and Susannah, and Mr. Blackwell allhave their opinions about whatwill get you on the best-dressedlist. Thanks to cable television,there are entire networks \u2014with accompanying websites \u2014that provide hourly input on thelatest trends in Paris, Milan,New York and L.A. In this era ofinformation overload, often-conflicting fashion advice canbe overwhelming and leavethose who are seeking directionfeeling confused instead. Dressing for success is less about fashion and more aboutdressing appropriately for yourrole and setting. In many set-tings, those in positions ofauthority came of age when the\"old rules\" regarding appropri-ate business attire were still inplace. Many of those in chargeare still scratching their headsand wondering how \"businessattire\" became \"business casu-al.\" And this was before the\"business\" element was aban-doned almost entirely and the\"casual\" side evolved into out-fits that wouldn't have beenworn outside the comfort of thehome in previous generations. Thankfully, because of to- day's more relaxed rules, dress-ing for success no longer meanswearing a navy blue uniformwith a starched white shirt and asilk tie or bow at the neck. Somerules still exist, however, and areworthy of consideration by up-and-coming professionals. Your Counseling Career - BY AMY REECE CONNELLY Dressing for success: Some rules never change Dress for the position to which you aspire. John Molloy, who is often credited with coin-ing the phrase \"dress for suc-cess,\" advised his followers topattern their wardrobes afterthose worn by supervisors twoor more levels up. Although hisbest-selling publication is nolonger in the mainstream, it'sstill good advice. Professionalappearance invites professionaltreatment. Dress for your audience. It is a given that counselors need torelate to their clients on manylevels. So it follows that itwould be insensitive to dress in$1,000 suits for sessions if yourclients are struggling to hoverabove the poverty line. But nei-ther does that mean you shouldwear torn jeans, rocker T-shirtsand flip-flops to relate to yourteenage clientele. Projecting asubtle air of authority through your appearance can enhancethe success you achieve withclients because it reinforcesyour credibility. Dress the body you have now, not the one you had in highschool. Shapes and sizes change over time (as do jacket cut, tiewidth, skirt length and pantrise). If you are legitimatelywearing the same size you didwhen you walked across thestage in your cap and gown,congratulations. But the rest ofus are better off wearing cloth-ing that genuinely fits. If youfall into that latter category, takecomfort in knowing that you'llbe more comfortable, and you'lllook better too. Avoid the 'toos.' If it's \"too\" anything, adjust. Too muchcolor or pattern, too manyaccessories, too tight, too shortor too much cleavage (some would say anyvisible cleavage is too much) can distract froman otherwise professional en-semble. And unless your job ismodeling for the Sports Illus- trated swimsuit edition, too much skin \u2014 a bare midriff, forexample \u2014 is a no-no in theworkplace. Invest in the classics and update with trendier pieces.Some clothing, such as wooltrousers, blazers and A-lineskirts in neutral colors (black,gray, tan or navy), withstandsthe test of time. The navy suitand the little black dress remainreliable wardrobe workhorses.High-quality pieces such asthese that will endure for sever-al seasons are at the center of aflexible, professional wardrobe.Buy seasonal accents to com-plete your look. A little attention to detail goes a long way. You don't have to spend a small fortune topresent a professional appear-ance. Maintaining a neat hair-style, keeping nails groomedand making certain your cloth-ing is in good repair will pro-vide the polish expected of professionals. Finally, if you want to know whether your casual ensembleis too casual for the office,try adding a navy blazer. If itdoesn't look out of place,you're probably OK.

He has contributed to numerousjournals in the field of counseling psy-chology and served on the editorialboards for three ACA journals. Counseling Today: Is Assessment in Counseling meant to be a textbook for counseling students or a practical hand-book for practicing counselors? Albert Hood: We've tried to write the book so that it fulfills both purposes. Itserves as the principal text in a numberof graduate counseling courses, provid-ing students with the basic knowledgeand skills necessary to make effectiveuse of many assessment instruments. Richard Johnson: But we also know it is a valuable part of the workinglibrary for many counseling profession-als. It's a handbook that can help them inthe communication of test results in aninterview or case report. It also providesspecific information about the more pop-ular tests and other assessment proce-dures used by counselors. CT:What are the major changes in the fourth edition of this popular handbook? RJ:There have been changes and new developments in many areas of assess-ment that counseling professionals needto be aware of. Recently, there have beena number of changes in the SAT andACT academic aptitude tests, as well asin school achievement tests, especiallyin view of the No Child Left Behind leg-islation. The Stanford-Binet, Wechslerand other intelligence tests have alsoundergone numerous revisions. Therehave been updatings of the Strong,Kuder and Department of Labor'sO*NET vocational inventories, as wellas changes in personality instruments,such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Per-sonality Inventory (MMPI) and the Cali-fornia Psychological Inventory. AH: We've also updated and put addi- tional emphasis on a number of sections,including the assessment of counselingoutcomes, high-stakes testing and theuse of assessment procedures for specialpopulations, including minorities, clientswith disabilities and older adults.CT: Do counselors sometimes over- rely on the various types of testing avail-able to them? AH: At times, some counselors undoubtedly do. But it's also true thatsometimes counselors fail to use teststhey should be using or dismiss testresults that have the potential for givingthem useful and important informationfor decision-making. That's why we'vetried to emphasize throughout the booknot just basic information about variousassessment procedures but also informa-tion about how to best interpret and usethese procedures within a counselingprocess. CT: This book provides counselors with a number of basic assessment pro-cedures. Are counselors usually familiarwith such procedures and using themadequately? RJ:While a solid sequence of gradu- ate courses in assessment certainlyshould make a counselor familiar withsuch procedures, the reality is thatassessment procedures vary in theamount of training and experiencerequired for them to be used effectively.Our book provides, for example, intro-ductory material on the use of theMMPI and projective techniques, butwe also make clear that advanced train-ing is needed before counselors areready to use these assessment proce-dures effectively. This book, however, isa good avenue for counselors to be cur-rent on the assessment tools and proce-dures most commonly in use and toidentify when more training and experi-ence are needed. /ornament23 Assessment in Counseling can be ordered directly from ACA (Order#72846).

The best way to describe the ACA Insurance Trust, sometimesaffectionately referred to simply as\"the Trust,\" is through its missionstatement. The Trust's mission is tooffer the highest quality insuranceproducts that are responsive to theneeds of practitioners (counselors).These products are to be offered atcompetitive rates and with a timelyresponse. To enhance and supportthe profession, protect the insuredand improve effectiveness, theACA Insurance Trust offers educa-tion in risk management, ethicalstandards and practices, and legalaspects of practice. The Trust pro-vides this support through directeducational efforts as well asthrough financial support of ACA. Who makes up the ACA Insur- ance Trust? The Trust is a separate-ly incorporated entity in partner-ship with ACA. Separate incorpo-ration was deemed important toshield the association from possibletax and legal liabilities. ACA has astrong voice in the governance ofthe Trust because four of the fivevoting trustees are active ACAmembers. Each year, the ACA pres-ident appoints one trustee to re-place another trustee who is rotat-ing off the board and also appointsthe chair of the Trust. The sittingpresident has a vote on the Trust.An independent insurance expertfills the remaining seat on theboard. ACA President Brian Canfield has appointed Bernal Baca chair ofthe Trust for the current fiscal year.\"Stability is a key objective forACAIT in its programs,\" Bacasays. \"There was a significantproblem in our recent history withthe financial strength of the insur-ance company for the professionalliability program. Our currentprovider brought in a new insur-ance company and took care of therelated concerns. We now enjoystability in rates with accompany-ing good service through Health-care Providers Service Organiza-tion (HPSO).\" The ACA Insurance Trust also aggressively pursues other types ofinsurance appropriate for ACAmembers and asks those providersto offer discounts that apply only to ACA members. Todate, we have established dis-counted term life insuranceand are working with medicalproviders to offer better ratesand features for dental and dis-ability policies writtenthrough the ACA InsuranceTrust sponsorship. Discountsalso apply to memberswho buy auto and homeown-ers insurance. The savings canbe especially significant whenACA members apply for autoand homeowners insurancetogether through the samecompany. The ACA Insurance Trust also provides collateral bene-fits to ACA members. Forexample, ACA members whoparticipate in the liability also access tothe risk management helpline. The helpline offers membersthe opportunity to discusspotential claims, receive ad-vice and decrease the possibil-ity of lawsuits. The risk man-agement helpline is staffed byattorneys who are experiencedin the mental health field. Theservice provides not onlypeace of mind but also practi-cal information that protectscounselors. The ACA Insurance Trust has a long history of commit-ted support to ACA and itsmembers. Recent examples ofthis support include work-shops in risk management, afree CD titled Risk Manage- ment Strategies for Profes-sional Counselors (2007) and the new ACA publication The Counselor and the Law: AGuide to Legal EthicalPractice , which Anne Marie\"Nancy\" Wheeler and BurtBertram . The effectiveness of the pro- fessional liability insuranceprogram and other sponsoredprograms enables the Trust toprovide payments to ACA andparticipate in branch, divisionand leadership conferences asexhibitors. In addition, theACA Insurance Trust has beenable to provide assistance tothe counselor licensing effortsin California. The Trust's efforts to foster a good working relationshipwith the insurance administra-tors have also provided accessto professionals who are po-tential ACA members. In addi-tion, because of this relation-ship, HPSO offers ACA freeads in its risk management newsletters.

Yet when it comes to following myown advice, I remain dedicated anddetermined for a period of time, but justlike my families, I forget and fall backinto the same old routines. I fall into thepattern of putting others ahead ofmyself. As I consider these patterns, I realize I am driven by the sense of accomplish-ment and reward I feel when I make adifference and help others. The allure isso strong that perhaps part of me figuresthe more I put into my job, the more Ican help people and, thus, the morerewarded I will feel. Does that increasemy sense of self-worth, I wonder? Dothe families I work with feel this too? Dothey feel more accomplished and in con-trol with each additional task they try toget done? The reality, though, is that the more I try to give allof myself, without saving time for other areas of my life, the less Iactually help others. My stress increases,which then decreases my active listen-ing, compassion, creative problem solv-ing and understanding. I am giving with-out being given back to; nothing isreplenishing my \"giving well.\" The samegoes for the families with which I work.The more things they try to \"take careof,\" the less they are able to do anythingto their satisfaction, continually leaving them with feelings of disappointment,helplessness, failure \u2014 \"just notenough.\" Self-care is not an easy lesson for many of us to embrace and embody. Icontinue to struggle with keeping my lifein balance. Despite repeated personallessons, I still have times when I take ontoo much, either at work or at home, andfind myself trying to do more than I canhandle. Luckily, I am learning to recog-nize the signs of stress more quickly andrealize when things are getting off-kilterso I can correct them. I have learned toaccept that as my stress level rises, mytolerance for frustration lowers, so it isbetter for me, all around, to get the bal-ance back. This self-recognition ensuresthat I can continue to help clients to thebest of my ability. IThere were no restrictions on scheduling home visits because all my nights werenow free. Once again, before I knew it, my entire day was filled with mental health.I did not go to the gym. I did not spendtime with friends. I came home late mostnights after appointments. Again, I hadforgotten about my self-care and thatwhen my life is out of balance, I becomemore stressed. Again, I had forgottenthat when I am more stressed, I am notas caring a clinician, which then causesme even more stress. Again, I was trulysurprised I had let this happen. How ridiculous that I continually encouraged my clients to take time forthemselves to ensure that they didn'tspread themselves too thin, and, yet,here I was disregarding my own guid-ance. And how easily it seemed to hap-pen, without me even realizing it. Sometimes, in the interest of wanting to care for my families and help them inany way that I can, I forget that part of caring for them is to make sure that Icare for myself too. I must care formyself so that I can listen, be presentand have tolerance, patience and under-standing. When I am not balanced, thesetraits tend to diminish. I am a perfection-ist, always wanting to learn more and bebetter, but part of that necessarilyincludes making sure I don't do toomuch. As I explore this realization inmyself, it also helps me to better under-stand how my clients get to this place.How easy it is to put our needs aside inthe name of helping others, giving ourall to make things better for the ones welove. I help my clients see that takingsome time to help themselves will alsohelp the ones they love \u2014 and I trulyspeak from experience. I have often counseled my families that trying to do everything sometimesmeans that nothing gets done well.

I Counseling T oday IOctober 2007 39 A revealing study concerning coun- selors' language use and their clients'emotional expressiveness is reported inthe July 2007 Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development . Researcher Lucila Ramos-Sanchez paired 65 Mexican American bilingualcollege students with counselors for one45-minute session to discuss stressors forMexican American students on campus.The counselors, who were EuropeanAmericans and Latino Americans, wereinstructed to conduct the session eitherentirely in English or in mixed Spanishand English (40 to 50 percent Spanishoverall). Students were randomly as-signed to European American counselorsspeaking English, European Americancounselors speaking both Spanish andEnglish, Latinas speaking English orLatinas speaking both Spanish and Eng-lish. Judges watched videotapes of all thesessions, rating the level of emotionalexpression they saw. European American bilingual counsel- ing elicited more client expressivenessthan any of the other types of counseling.Ramos-Sanchez speculates that the use ofSpanish by the European American coun-selors was a pleasant surprise and bol-stered the therapeutic alliance. Potentially, counselor trainees can enhance their effectiveness with a largesegment of the U.S. population by learn-ing Spanish. Two training programs inthe United States have already addedcourses with a Spanish component totheir curriculum. And, naturally, manyopportunities exist for trainees to developsecond-language skills on their own. What does it all mean? The Life Regard Index (LRI) is a fre- quently used measure of meaning of life,a construct of great current interest thathas blossomed with the positive psychol- ogy movement. The creators of the scale,John Battista and Richard Almond, builtthe instrument with two subscales inmind: \"Framework,\" meaning knowledgeof one's purpose in life, and \"Fulfill-ment,\" the sense of realizing this purpose. Often, the Framework subscale is con- sidered the cognitive part of meaning inlife, and the Fulfillment subscale is con-sidered the affective part. However, theconstruct of meaning in life easily over-laps with other constructs such as pas-sion, energy, happiness and clarity ofgoals, and researchers have had difficultyuntangling these concepts. In the July2007 issue of Measurement and Evalua- tion in Counseling and Development , Michael F. Steger takes on confirmatoryand exploratory factor analyses of theLRI. Researchers using the LRI and otherwell-being measures can benefit from hisefforts. Steger did not find evidence fordistinct Framework and Fulfillment fac-tors, for a model separating positivelyworded and negatively worded items orfor a unidimensional conceptualization ofmeaning in life. From exploratory factor analysis, three LRI factors emerged. One factor reflecteda conglomeration of content pertaining tomeaning in life, passion and general con-tentment. The second reflected people'slack of clarity about their own values.The third factor reflected people's lack ofclarity about their own goals. Factor No. 1 mostly captured the posi- tive items, while factors No. 2 and No. 3captured negatively phrased items. Stegerconcludes that the subscales are unclearin their exact meaning. He advises cau-tion in interpreting LRI scores forresearch or psychotherapy.ACA Journal Spotlight - BY SUSAN X DAY Giving more than lip service to multiculturalism Training for a job change A longitudinal study of people who became unemployed when their companyclosed provides important insights forcareer counselors and workers. Re-searchers Mary A. Gowan and DavidLepak (September 2007 Journal of Employment Counseling ) analyzed pre- job-loss compensation and post-job-losscompensation to investigate what factorsaffected the workers' new situations twoyears after the closing of their company(an airline). Salary at the end of the previous job, managerial training and administrativetraining significantly raised the level ofsalary on the workers' new jobs. Howev-er, school education level, nonspecifictraining (such as time or stress manage-ment) and technical training did notraise starting salary at the new job. Theauthors suggest that workers who wantto enhance marketability seek out general and portable types of training,such as management, clerical skills and administration. In their study, individuals with job- or firm-specific technical skills were leastlikely to be re-employed two years afterjob loss, indicating that these skills maybe less transferable, more quickly outdat-ed or not required on the current marketwith the reduced number of tech jobs.Seeking out general, transferable trainingand certification is the best protection inan unstable job environment.

Health plans routinely use discriminatory copayment requirements and arbitrary limits on inp atient and outpatient coverage to restrict access to mental health care. Although most states have enacted mental health parity laws, these laws vary from state to state and don' t apply to self-insured health plans. Separate bills are pending in both the House and the Senate to establish strong federal parity protections.

IWe were surprised and gratified by readers' response to the informationabout using a superbill in our August2007 column and have received almost100 requests to date for examples of oursuperbill. With the superbill option, the coun- selor can collect the fee at the time of thesession. The client then sends the super-bill directly to his/her managed care orinsurance company to be reimbursed.Many insurance companies accept thesuperbill for reimbursement, but somemay not. Q: I have a question about a certain managed care company. I recently goton their panel, but they keep referringEAP clients to me. I don't reallyunderstand the difference between anEAP client and a regular counselingclient, other than the fact that I don'tget paid nearly as much to see theEAP clients. Is this sort of a scam, oris there something I don't understandabout this system? How can I get paidthe full counseling fee for seeing theseclients? A:First, let's start by defining terms. EAP stands for employee assistance pro-gram. Most major employers offer EAPsas a benefit to employees and their fami-lies. EAP is essentially a counselingassessment and referral service paid forby the employer. Employees can confi-dentially access counseling services (orbe referred by the employer) for mentalhealth, marriage/family, substance abuse,elder care, legal or financial issues at nocost to the employee. In the past few years, managed care companies began offering EAP servicesbundled in with the insurance package.Most of these bundled packages offer afew \"no cost\" sessions for the insured,meaning they do not have a copay orfees applied to their deductible. Theinsured can see any counselor, not justthe EAP counselor, and be covered by the managed care company to use theEAP benefit. Typically, EAP sessionreimbursements are at a slightly lowerfee than the regular insurance contractrate. However, after the EAP sessions,and if clinically appropriate, the coun-selor can continue treating the client andaccess the regular insurance benefit. We don't recommend signing up with a couple of managed care companiesdue to their horrible EAP rates (theirregular fees are not much better) and theextensive paperwork involved. Contractsfor getting on managed care panels caninclude participation in both the EAPand regular insurance program. Read the contract before you sign it. You canchoose not to participate in the EAP andstill be a provider. If you decide not toaccept EAP clients, look at your contractand see how to terminate participation.Don't, however, just refuse to acceptEAP clients, because you have a signedagreement, and they could come backand hold you to the letter of the law. Q: I am a therapist in private prac- tice. What is the appropriate timeframe for sending a termination letterto a client who has dropped out oftherapy but has not officially notifiedthe therapist that they do not wish tocontinue? A:We don't know of any standard procedure that addresses what to doshould a client \"drop out\" of therapy.The 2005 ACA Code of Ethics addresses termination and referral issues in Stan-dard A.11. However, there is no exactreference either to method of contact ortime frame should a client discontinuetherapy without notifying the counselor. Still, while there are no hard and fastrules, there are other considerations.

More than ever, the world is in crisis. Anyone with the courageand integrity to look willobserve an abundance of pain,suffering and widespread vic-timization in many quarters ofhuman life, with some tragicallyclose to home. While traumaticevents happen on multiple lev-els, most of us can view thesekinds of experiences as beingpart of life's journey. We usethese experiences for personalgrowth. However, other individuals \u2014 often those who seek treatment\u2014 have difficulty making thatmeaning and coping with trau-matic events of a societal or per-sonal nature. In these cases,these individuals, women in par-ticular, may turn to substanceabuse as a form of maladaptivecoping. Research studies sug-gest that upward of 75 percentof women in substance abuseprograms report a history oftrauma. Therefore, clinicians in the field of addiction cannotneglect treating this prominentunderlying issue in substance-abusing women. We no longer live in a society in which counselors are present-ed with one condition or anoth-er. Rather, we now see morecomplex blends of addiction,psychological disorders andinvalidation. Therefore, if coun-selors assume that the medicalmodel is the predominant expla-nation for addiction, we fail toacknowledge the importance ofthe environment and the impactof trauma on the psyche. As aresult of this failure, counselorswill be busy treating relapse butwill neglect the core issue. Women suffering from sub- stance abuse and post-traumaticstress disorder are at higher riskof being repeatedly victimizedby relying on substances to\"numb\" their (Covington, not labelthese women continuallyrelapse. Rather, it would be ben- eficial to acknowledge that sub-stance abuse does not have tooccur in isolation. Instead, theremay be a cause, such as trauma,that leads an individual to mal-adaptively cope with unbearablestressors and symptoms. Addiction counselors may believe that by medically treat-ing the symptoms of addiction,PTSD symptoms will subside.However, in many cases thereverse occurs and these clientsself-medicate to desensitizethemselves from traumaticevents. Ultimately, through val-idation and teaching effectivecoping skills, counselors helpto eliminate or drasticallyreduce the need for substanceabuse by attacking the eventsthat trigger the clients' per-ceived need to embrace theescape mechanism that sub-stance abuse provides. Counselors should acknowl- edge the strong associationbetween trauma and substanceuse and prioritize treatmentaccordingly so clients and Letters Continued from page 4 women in particular do not have to experience the repeated inval-idation of relapse. As coun-selors, we adhere to the fiveunderlying ethical principles toguide our behavior. If addictioncounselors fail to acknowledgethe strong association between PTSD and substance abuse, andwe fail to treat PTSD symptomsin addiction treatment facilities,we are failing our clients. Elizabeth VenturaPittsburgh Imunity counseling, such as edu- cating the public, advocating forclients outside the classroom andpotentially giving presentationsto educate institutions. I remem-ber sitting up straighter, openingmy eyes wider and directing allmy attention to the professor. Hewas describing my dream job!Afterward, a number of myclassmates grumbled about whatthey perceived as extra work, while I listened in disbelief. Theinstructor had described my pas-sion so clearly that I had a hardtime understanding why anyonewould not be excited by whatwas said in class. I understoodthen that finding a way to incor-porate both counseling andteaching would be the culmina-tion of a dream I had not previ-ously known existed. Energy level was another key to my career equation. In a pro-fession with such a high burnoutrate, to continually become bet-ter with experience rather thanexhausted without the energy tohelp clients effectively, peopleneed to preserve themselves.How long would I be able tokeep my passion for counselingby working with clients fulltime? I knew that continuing to work with sex offenders, sexual-ly reactive youth, inmates andclients with addiction issueswould burn me out quickly. It isironic that the very clients I findthe most rewarding to work withalso tend to be the ones who eataway at my energy level. Iwished for the strength andendurance to remain just as ener-getic after 10 years of counsel-ing as in the beginning, but deepdown I knew I would be the bestpotential counselor over the longterm only if I diversified myenergies early in my career. Another critical career devel- opment piece was how othersperceived me. The dean of mymaster's program thought I wasa leader and asked me to reacti-vate the school's Chi Sigma Iotachapter. He encouraged me topresent at conferences and men-tioned my name when speakingof individuals who might enjoygiving large-scale presentations.Peers came to talk with me aboutmy presentations, which theysometimes found fascinatingdespite knowing little about thetopics beforehand. I also foundclassmates who wanted to workwith me on class presentations because they thought my teach-ing methods were interestingand entertaining. I needed thisfeedback to understand myselfas an educator, and it created inme a desire to build on thesestrengths. I was very anxious about my professional weaknesses, includ-ing understanding research andstatistics. Only as my confidencegrew that I was on the right pathdid my fear of these weaknessestransform into a challenge. Irealized that stagnating \u2014 witheither strengths or weaknesses\u2014 was not an option, so I usedone of my strengths (facinguncomfortable situations headon) to challenge my weaknesses.I started by applying to research-focused institutions. Perhaps themost elemental answer to how Idecided to pursue a Ph.D. is this:I took stock of myself andaccepted all the parts, includingthose that needed changing. Today I am giddy when I'm able to follow the statisticsinstructor's lectures, and I findmyself gleeful when all six peo-ple with whom I share an officeare there in the room at the sametime. There is camaraderie in this academic experience that Ican only hope readers will alsoexperience. When I still become paralyzed with the question of why I am ina Ph.D. program, colleagueshelp me mobilize the answeronce again. If I have learned onething these last eight months, itis that the delicate balance inacademe can be steadied only byfriendships. The question of whyI am in a doctoral program isabsent when sledding down ahill on a snow day with mycohort. The question seemsridiculous when being driven tothe doctor by a colleague or eat-ing supper with fellow confer-ence presenters. I can callfriends when I experience acade-mic desperation or when I ques-tion my sanity. And they listen asif I were sane. Over the phone, Ican ask old friends why I am in adoctoral program. They answersimply, \"Because you weremeant to be.\" I feel incredibly fortunate to have found a career that willenable me to use my strengthsand improve on my weaknesseswhile also providing a callingthat drives my efforts. I hope you too can identify your calling \u2014one that is worth fighting for.When others ask about your pro-fessional path, I hope you areable to answer confidently thatyou have a calling that will getyou through both the best andthe most difficult of times. I am forever indebted to the football player in the middle ofthe front row who asked, \"Whatmade you decide to get aPh.D.?\" He was the one whochallenged me to simplify mythoughts: I did it because I wasmeant to do it.

Hehas always been an excellentrole model and leader in thefield of counseling. His ongoingsupport was a very positive partof my life. Sometimes we don'tknow that we are being support-ed when, in fact, we are. He hasalways been a rock for a lot ofus. His commitment and sup-port to his students over theyears really makes him an out-standing individual.\" Stuart Chen-Hayes was a doc- toral student at Kent State Uni-versity when he first met Houseat an ACA conference in theearly 1990s. \"I was amazed tofind a gay counselor educatorcomfortable with himself andout of the closet. I hadn't metany out gay counselor educatorsprior, and his sense of humorwas most engaging,\" recalledChen-Hayes, past president ofCounselors for Social Justiceand associate professor of coun-selor education/school counsel-ing at Lehman College of theCity University of New York.\"(His) wisdom, humor, grace inthe midst of drama, advocacyand playfulness have been anextraordinary gift to me andcountless others, professionallyand personally. ... I know that(his) spirit and words and gentlelaughter will be advocating anddancing with all of us for many generations to come.\" House received his bachelor's of science degree in 1960 andhis master's in 1961, both fromBall State University. He wenton to earn a doctorate of educa-tion from OSU in 1970. House worked to transform school counseling in 23 statesand Washington, D.C. He hadthe broadest impact through hisefforts at the National Center forTransforming School Counsel-ing.

Manyof the entries were pepperedwith House's sense of humor ormentioned weekend plans.Often his friends replied, wish-ing him a happy birthday orteasing him about attending his50th high school reunion. Asidefrom the many well wishes andprayers, several messages fromfriends and colleagues con-veyed gratitude, thanked himfor being an inspiration andeven expressed hopes of futurehappy hour gatherings. \"I think the tool has helped in many ways, but the opportunityfor people to know what isgoing on, to respond if theywant to and to be able to hearfrom folks in so many differentplaces is quite amazing,\" Housesaid. \"Somehow, there is somepeace of mind for me that I amable to put the information outto folks and let them decidehow to process, what to do, howto respond.\" When asked how the Caring- Bridge website might beviewed as beneficial from acounselor's perspective, Housereplied, \"This is an interestingquestion and takes me differentplaces. But I think what theblog does is allow people to usethe site in ways that they neverthought of, to go in new direc-tions, to think in ways perhapsthat haven't been exploredbefore.\" The intentional act of writing about one's experiences cancause a person to reevaluate andrethink their perceptions andviewpoints when they see theirwords on paper or, in this case,on the computer screen, Housenoted. When House wasn't feeling well enough to write the posts,his daughter, Kelly, or his lifepartner, Guthrie, would updatethe blog. They also shared theirgratitude for all those readingand replying to the entries. Theblog also allowed House andhis daughter to spend some spe-cial time together in his finaldays, when she would print outthe words of comfort fromfriends and share them with herfather.

Survey says world's mental health needs largely unmet According to the Global Burden of Disease and Risk Factors published in2006, mental disorders rank among thetop 10 illnesses causing disabilityworldwide, with depression the leadingcause of disability among individualsages 15 and older. But based on resultsof a new survey of 17 countries con-ducted as part of the World HealthOrganization's World Mental HealthSurvey Initiative, the world's mentalhealth care needs are going largelyunmet. That is especially true in lessdeveloped countries, but high-incomenations are far from immune to theproblem. Results of t he initiative, par- tially funded by the National Institutesof Health's National Institute of MentalHealth, were published in the Septem-ber 2007 issue of The Lancet . \"Good treatments are available for many mental disorders,\" said NIMHDirector Thomas R. Insel. \"Yet theworld continues to struggle with thevery real challenge of providing theseservices to the people who most needthem. The WHO survey unmistakablyreinforces the urgency that we must dobetter.\" Philip S. Wang, director of the NIMH Division of Services and Inter-vention Research, and his colleaguesanalyzed data from face-to-face inter-views on mental health service usewith 84,848 adults across all economicspectrums in countries around the world. Respondents were asked aboutanxiety, post-traumatic stress, moodand substance abuse disorders. Theywere also asked if they had receivedany services in the past year for mentaldisorders and, if so, what types of ser-vices they had used, such as generalmedical professionals, mental healthprofessionals, religious counselors ortraditional healers. Overall, fewer people with mental disorders in less developed countriessought services in comparison withthose in developed countries. In addi-tion, the survey found that people incountries spending more of their grossnational product on health care usedservices more often. The U.S. popula-tion used services more than any othercountry, at 18 percent. By comparison,11 percent of France's population usedservices, whereas Nigeria's rate of ser-vices was lowest at 1.6 percent. In all countries surveyed, women were more likely than men to seekmental health services. Among otherfindings: IMiddle-aged people were morelikely to receive services thanthose younger or older IPeople with more education weremore likely to seek services formental problems IMarried people were less likely touse mental health services thanunmarried people Most of those who sought care for mental disorders received help from thegeneral medical sector (primary caredoctors, nurses) rather than specializedmental health services (psychiatrists,psychologists), religious and commu-nity counselors or complementary andalternative medicine providers (includ-ing traditional healers). Among thosereceiving services, a substantial num-ber of survey respondents reported thatthey did not receive minimally ade-quate services. The survey definedminimally adequate services as at leasteight visits to any service sector, orbeing in ongoing treatment at the timeof the interview, or receiving a medica-tion for at least one month with four ormore visits to a medical professionalover a 12-month period. Inadequate services were most com- monly found in low-income countries,but even in some high-income coun-tries, people received inadequate ser-vices. For example, in the UnitedStates, only 18 percent received mini-mally adequate services \u2014 much lowerthan any other high-income country.The next lowest level of minimally ade-quate services in a high-income coun-try was 32 percent, in Japan. Franceand Germany had the highest levels ofadequate services at 43 percent each. \"Although people sought and used services more in the United States,most did not receive adequate care \u2014evidence of a striking disconnect in the U.S. mental health care system,\" Wangsaid. \"We need to help developingcountries implement more effectivemental health care services, but we alsoneed to do a better job at home. Theglobal mental health care situationappears dire.\" For more information onthe survey results, visit www.nimh. nih.gov/science-news/index.shtml . ACA attends U.N. conference on global warming, mental health ACA Chief Professional Officer David Kaplan represented the associa-tion at the 60th Annual United NationsDepartment of Public Information/Nongovernmental Con-ference, All,\" Sept. 5-7 at U.N.headquarters in New York City. The conference, attended by approxi- mately 3,000 delegates, marked ACA'sfirst official U.N. action since beingdesignated a nongovernmental organi-zation (NGO) of the United Nationslast December. The United Nationsselects certain nonprofit organizationsfor NGO partnership status based ontheir involvement in U.N.-related workand because they have been deemed tohave effective information programs inplace. NGO status allows ACA to havegreater recognition in speaking out onthe needs of counseling around theworld. Kaplan, along with delegates from mental health-related NGOs fromaround the world, discussed the mentalhealth aspects of global warming. Helearned that drought is the most com-mon global natural disaster, surpassingtornadoes, floods, hurricanes and fires ,which often receive greater attention. \"Unlike floods and storms, droughts are long, ongoing and chronic,\" Kaplansaid, adding that families and commu-nities continue to struggle to find cleandrinking water worldwide. Further-more, he added, many are forced torelocate because there are no crops tobe sold or eaten. \"There are significant emotional and psychological issues not being ad-dressed,\" he said, \"one being the con-tinuous stress of not being able to meetthe basic needs of living. In agricultur-al societies, farmers are facing dyingcrops and are being displaced becauseof financial stress.\" Among the presentations that reflect- ed mental health concerns at the U.N.conference on global warming: I\"Climate Change and the Mind-Body-Spirit Connection: for Holistic andEducation,\" sponsored by theArmenian International Women'sAssociation. The session high-lighted the interdependent rela-tionship between individuals andthe environment. Panel members,many of which were from Africa, Armenia and Indonesia, addressedthe physical, emotional, mentaland spiritual effects of climatechange. Speakers illustrated howtaking care of oneself takes care ofthe earth. I\"Partnerships to Mobilize Commu-nity Health and Mental Health Re-sources for Recovery, Resilienceand Risk Reduction of Climate-Related Disasters,\" sponsored bythe International Association ofApplied Psychology. Panelistsdescribed practical ways NGOscan form partnerships with othercommunity agencies for risk reduc-tion and psychosocial responses toclimate-related disasters. I\"Climate Crisis - Fighting to Sur-vive,\" sponsored by the U.N. Asso-ciation of Finland. The presenta-tion was given from a social justicestandpoint and directed attention tomarginalized voices from aroundthe world. The goal was to enhancedialogue about building a globalcoalition on the climate crisis. \"This was really a new take on disas- ter mental health for me and I think forACA,\" Kaplan said. \"I've been to sev-eral workshops and conferences on thesubject of disaster mental health, andno one is talking about the mental heathissues of those living in drought-effect-ed areas, including those in the UnitedStates. Global warming is only going toexacerbate current drought-strickenareas, so this is something counselorsreally need to consider. We need toaddress the mental health issues of notonly citizens of the U.S., but also citi-zens of the world.\" Said ACA Executive Director Richard Yep, \"NGOs are often the most effec-tive voices for the concerns of ordinarypeople in the international arena. NGOsinclude the most outspoken advocatesof human rights, the environment, socialprograms and women's rights. NGOsmay also address broader or relatedissues such as poverty, hunger andhumanitarian aid.\" Time to prepare for National Family Caregivers month ACA is proud to join the National Family Caregivers Association in nam-ing November as National FamilyCaregivers month.
