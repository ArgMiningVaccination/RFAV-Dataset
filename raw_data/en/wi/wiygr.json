Spiritual healing can be accomplished in a [variety of ways](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8054459/). Some current approaches are only concerned with restoring equilibrium to the human body's etheric or non-physical energy field. Shamanic healers aim to restore the essence of the spirit and heal soul loss. On the other hand, many holistic healers emphasize the integration of the body, heart, mind, and spirit. However, there are other agencies that combine the best of these methods and work in the depth and transpersonal realms of psychology. Spiritual healing may be classified into five types: - Physical healing (of the body) - Spiritual healing (of the spirit or soul) - Mental healing (of the mind) - Emotional healing (of the heart) - Healing on any and all levels (of the body, heart, mind, and spirit) To identify what form of healing you require, ask yourself the following questions. What are you most concerned about in your life? Are you currently struggling with any single or numerous issues? Once you get their responses, you may choose what form of spiritual healing therapy you require. For example, if you suffer from chronic pain or feel depressed, you will require physical and [mental treatment](https://healthcarebusinessclub.com/articles/consumer/top-10-ways-faith-based-therapy-is-changing-mental-health/) - ideally from a holistic healer.
