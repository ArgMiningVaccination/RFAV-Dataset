As we encourage the body's innate tendency for healing, we endeavor to expand the conventional definition of healing to include mental, emotional and spiritual aspects. We foster an environment where both patient and practitioner are engaged in their own healing process and lifelong learning. NorthShore's Integrative Medicine Program is one of the largest and most well-established programs in the country and is a member of the national [Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine](http://www.imconsortium.org/).We use safe, evidence-based complementary therapies and communicate fully with patients' traditional western medicine physicians and specialists to optimize health and a heightened sense of well being. Our Practice Includes: [Integrative Medicine physician consultations](https://www.northshore.org/Integrative-Medicine/Our-Practices/) [Chinese medicine and stress relief strategies](https://www.northshore.org/Integrative-Medicine/Our-Practices/stress-management-stress-relief/) [Integrative bodywork](https://www.northshore.org/Integrative-Medicine/Our-Practices/Integrative-Bodywork-and-Massage/), including various forms of massage and energy work [Nutritional counseling](https://www.northshore.org/integrative-medicine/our-practices/nutrition-plan/) [Herbal medicine counseling](https://www.northshore.org/Integrative-Medicine/Our-Practices/Herbal-Medicine-Counseling/) [Therapeutic Yoga, Meditation, [Spiritual care and music therapy](https://www.northshore.org/Integrative-Medicine/Our-Practices/Spiritual-Counseling/) [Lifestyle Medicine Programs](https://www.northshore.org/integrative-medicine/our-practices/therapeutic-lifestyles-program/)for weight management Resident Program We are currently accepting applications from medical students, residents and fellows in allopathic (MD) and osteopathic (DO) medicine for a limited number of positions. Trainees are selectived based on individual philosophy and the desire to practice integratively in their chose field of medicine. Because our rotation slots fill up several months in advance of desired start times, early requests are strongly recommended. NorthShore University HealthSystem residents receive priority. Our rotation is generally four consecutive weeks. This is an experiential rotation. Our intention is to help prepare residents to be better physicians by introducing practices that broaden an understanding of health, illness and the role of the physician beyond the biomedical model. We anticipate that through exposure to these different philosophies residents will begin to develop a level of comfort with the most common alternative therapies as well as with the data that supports or refutes their efficacy. As part of this experience, we want residents to think of themselves as less of an authority and more as the \"patient\" in order to better identify those lifestyle habits that are potentially sabotaging health. We want residents to begin to obseve their own attitude and practices regarding personal health. it is one thing to talk about health and quite another to actually live your own advice. Residents will be asked to identify one lifestyle behavior that they would like to change or incorporate and then take the necessary steps to impact this change and document the experience. Residents will also be encourages to develop a practice of self-care and will be required to schedule a personal health screening and also to participate in our weekly yoga classes. Our hope is that residents will begin to appreciate the unique forces influencing Integrative Medicine and also appreciate the concerns of conventional physicians regarding the presence of this new field. For more information, contact Elton Guillen at [eguillen@northshore.org](mailto:eguillen@northshore.org). Rotations are available on a first-come, first served basis with priority given to University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine medical students, residents and fellows. An inter-institutional agreement is required for learners rotating from outside the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. Testimonial: \"I chose the Integrative Medicine rotation to try something \"different\" during internship. This elective introduced me to the scope of integrative medicine, including natural supplements, acupuncture, meditation, and tai-chi. We also discussed the evidence behind these interventions, which really opened my mind to considering therapies that are not taught in medical school. This elective has already changed my clinical interests and residency and will certainly shape how I practice dermatology.\" - Arjun Dayal, MD University of Chicago Medicine For "}
