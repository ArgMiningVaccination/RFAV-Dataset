Herbal remedies are simple recipes and preparations that use medicinal plants for their benefits. These remedies and knowledge of herbs have been developed over time, handed down from one generation to the next. Many people use herbal medicine to provide an additional source of nutrition, as many herbs are rich in micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals. Herbalists also use them to help support the body's organs and systems, while also supporting sleep, good digestion, better mood, and hormonal balance. Types of Remedies There are many different ways to use both medicinal herbs. And most herbal recipes are easy to make at home. Infusions, teas, and tisanes are made by infusing fresh or dried herbs in hot water. Infusions tend to be more concentrated than teas and tisanes. Tinctures are made by infusing herbs into alcohol, and they tend to be a concentrated source of plant nutrients. They're also a good way to prepare herbs that are very bitter or otherwise unpalatable. Herbal vinegars, shrubs, and oxymels are vinegar-based herbal infusions. You make them by macerating herbs and sometimes fruit in vinegar. You can then add sugar to make a shrub or honey to make an oxymel. Infused oil, butter, and ghee are also popular herbal preparations. That's because many herbs contain fat-soluble nutrients that benefit from oil-based extraction methods. Using herb-infused butter and oil is a great way to infuse a dish with lots of flavors. Herbal honey is another easy choice. You can add herbs to warm honey and let it sit. This infuses the honey with the flavor and aroma of the herbs, making for more impactful desserts. Tips for Working with Herbs Most herbal recipes are fairly easy to follow. But you do need to pay attention to a few things. Namely, take care in sourcing your herbs and choose organically grown or ethically wildcrafted recipes where possible. Additionally, read up on your herbs, their uses, their benefits, and any potential side effects. If you're planning to use herbs therapeutically, reach out to your healthcare provider first.
