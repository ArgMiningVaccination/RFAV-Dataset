[@barb-larue7gmail-com](https://vestibular.org/participant/barb-larue7gmail-com/) it's horrible isn't it so debilitating. Am hoping the vertigo is going to wear off eventually, each attack has come on so suddenly. [@judithc](https://vestibular.org/participant/judithc/) yes, it is indeed. We need to feel normal again and live our lives again!!

I was vaccinated in March last 2021 with my first shot and the second dose was in April. Everything went well with those. Then I went and got a booster early November and I had a sense of imbalance for almost an entire month! Thankfully that subsided in December but I then caught Covid in December as well. :/ After what seemed like long haul symptoms of chest pain and palpitations I went to get an EKG and it came back normal. I still have a cough every so often too. It wasn't until last week my sense of imbalance came back and I've felt like this for almost a week. I just wish I never got the booster.... It seems like my vestibular system has not recovered yet. I have a doctors appt Sunday so maybe they may want to run some tests. Hi, I am an american living as a missionary in Peru, I had my first shot in November last year, had dizziness for a few days a couple of weeks later, second shot in December, had a dizziness attach in January. Now the middle of last month had a severe dizziness attack for 15 minutes and now I am dizzy all the time. After that 15 minute attack, I could not sleep for over a week and still cannot sleep without using Zolpidem. I've tried melatonin and valerian root, they do not work. I do not have a problem with being sleepy just cannot sleep. So my question is, do any of you have sleeping problems, and if so what do you take long term to help. I have seen three doctors now, and tomorrow I will see a new ENT doctor that somebody recommended to me. Not sure what I have and not sure how to sleep.

Hi Fran, Below are a couple of resources for vestibular problems, I hope they can give you some help in determining you next step. Heavy metal toxicity is I think something you should look into more closely as well. Also, one question, have you had an increase in hiccups. [https://dizzy.com/wp-content/uploads/Vestibular-Toxicity-Article.pdf](https://dizzy.com/wp-content/uploads/Vestibular-Toxicity-Article.pdf) [https://balanceanddizziness.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Vestibular-toxicity-handout.pdf](https://balanceanddizziness.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Vestibular-toxicity-handout.pdf) [@barb-larue7gmail-com](https://vestibular.org/participant/barb-larue7gmail-com/) I just read your comment and I see a holistic Dr for almost everything. Was totally against getting this vaccine in the 1st place, but like some many others, my job was making it difficult and basically forcing to get vaccinated. My last dose was in November and just recently started feeling dizzy and when I lay down at night I feel like heart palpitations. I have not seen my holistic Dr in a while or my acupuncturist. I'm wondering if I should contact them to make an appt. Has your symptoms as far as the dizziness subsided at all? New follow up. After all the shit trying something new. Contacted Frontline Doctor's spoke and did a video chat with Jenny a nurse practitioner so started a new regimen. Ivermectin,Prednisone,VitaminD,VitaminC.It's all trial and error with each person starting my second week on the Ivermectin no changes yet but ill give it a chance .Shit its been 8 months of this maybe the miracle cure might happen will see. Hey, I'm a new member here. I am also suffering from vertigo. I have undergone many treatments. Actually, from here, I can understand that the COVID vaccine is the reason behind vertigo for many people. I also got vertigo after my vaccination. Now I am controlling it with the help of exercise. [@stoates16](https://vestibular.org/participant/stoates16/) i haven't seen major changes, yet. The vertigo is still with me, but \"different\". I'm walking in a drunken way but the spinning isn't as intense. I hope you find relief soon. I want to post in the future when I'm well again. I just came across this and had to put my story on here as well. I'm 50 years old and I'm having very bad dizzy spells since my second PFIZER Covid Vaccine on May14th 2021. I've been tested with wearing a heart monitor, ultrasound of my heart and neck, MRI of my brain, blood work, tilt table test and now physical therapy. Everything came back negative. I'm racking my brain here and have no idea how to fix this. This happens when I get up from being reclined on my couch, getting up from a chair, bending over for longer then 45 seconds then standing up and getting out of bed. It last about 5-10 seconds until my head clears up. I have collapsed 3 times and fell. I still have a cardiologist and neurologist appointment coming up so hopefully they can shed some light on this but so far no one has been able to help me. So I feel everyone else's pain. One other thing I would like to add my motor skills are off as well. I'll be walking and all of a sudden out of nowhere my left foot will drag and trip me up. I'm not sure if anyone else is experiencing any of that. If anyone else finds out why this is happening to them please let us know. I've been on short term disability since December 20th 2021. [Chad3072](https://vestibular.org/participant/chad3072/) [@hspcanadiangirl](https://vestibular.org/participant/hspcanadiangirl/) Hello, I found this site after googling about dizziness and vertigo. I just got covid for the first time, I'm unvaccinated. It started one month ago and i never had it before so now im wondering if it could be a symptom of covid, my kid's had a bad cough over a month ago and I'm wondering if I've had covid before without knowing and if this is a symptom of long covid . I also read that low vitamin D can also cause this. I rang my doctor but they don't seem to bothered and asked if I wanted medication to stop the vertigo but I would prefer to know the cause. It's interesting to read other's opinions here. I wanted to add I've never had vertigo before and am experiencing it so often over the past weeks and allot again today. I'm "}
