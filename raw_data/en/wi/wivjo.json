Replenish electrolytes with Hydration Drink Tabs It all started in 1993 in a Berkeley, CA kitchen. Our founder, Dr. Bill Vaughan was on a mission to create a better, more easily-digestible fuel for his ultra-runner daughter to race at the iconic Western States 100. Taking in the right nutritients at the right time allows you to perform your best and feel great doing it. Our Energy Gels contain carbohydrates, electrolytes, and amino acids to keep you going strong. If it doesn't taste good, athletes won't use it. That's why we continue to add new flavors to our lineup each year. We focus on sweet, sour, bitter, and salty tastes to make sure there's a GU flavor for every craving. We first created our original gel packets for ultra-trail runners pushing the boundaries of the sport, but over 30 years later, our Energy Gels are just as beneficial for someone hitting the gym after work as they are for world champion triathletes, cyclists, and runners. 1% of our proceeds support efforts promoting Physical Movement, Environmental Stewardship, and Food Awareness + 22 FLAVORS + 9 FLAVORS + 6 FLAVORS + 7 FLAVORS Designed for tough efforts when you need a little more. Roctane Energy Gels have extra electrolytes for hydration and BCAAs to protect your muscles. Carbohydrates and electrolytes in one bottle make it easy to stay fueled and hydrated when you're going all out. High quality whey protein helps repair and rebuild muscle tissue after hard efforts.
