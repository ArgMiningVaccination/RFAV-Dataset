Besides activating every possible travel alert and notification on your phone and obsessively monitoring local news both in your current location and future destination, it's not easy to keep track of the latest updates. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has developed a potential solution: an IATA Travel Pass digital health passport launching early this year with Etihad and Emirates airlines.

The digital passport will allow passengers to share certified, official test results via their smartphones at checkpoints along their travel route.
