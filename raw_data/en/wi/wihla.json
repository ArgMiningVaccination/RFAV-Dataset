I understand from counsel there are no4 preliminary matters to be addressed. We are in a5 position to resume with the cross-examination of Dr.6 Mumper.7 Good morning, Dr. Mumper. You continue to 8 be under oath.9 Whereupon, 10 ELIZABETH MUMPER 11 having been previously duly sworn, was 12 recalled as a witness herein and was examined and13 testified further as follows:14 CROSS-EXAMINATION (Resumed) 15 BY MR. JOHNSON: 16 Q Good morning, Doctor. 17 A Good morning. 18 Q When we wrapped up yesterday, we were 19 talking about porphyrin testing, and I want to go back20 to that issue just briefly.21 This is not the first time you've testified 22 as an expert in a case involving autism and mercury,23 is that correct?24 A That is correct. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 6 of 2391461 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q You testified in a case called Blackwell v. 1 Sigma Aldridge in Baltimore, is that right? 2 A That's correct. 3 Q And do you remember giving a deposition in 4 that case?5 A Yes, I do. 6 Q And that was in January of 2007? 7 A Yes. 8 Q And you also testified at an evidentiary 9 hearing held in August of 2007, is that right?10 A That's correct. 11 Q At the hearing, the evidentiary hearing, do 12 you remember being asked about laboratory results for13 biomarkers that you look for in your patients to14 determine if they are harmed by mercury?15 A I'm sure that I was, but it's been so long 16 that I would appreciate it if you would flash the17 testimony up.18 Q We'd be happy to. 19 And do you remember testifying, or actually 20 why don't you just read the highlighted portion of21 your testimony.22 A \"Probably the most helpful test to me now is 23 a porphyrin test, and the reason I like the porphyrin24 test is that it actually looked at the impact of ethyl25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 7 of 2391462 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888mercury and other heavy metals on body biochemistry1 and body physiology.\"2 I realize now I should have specified the 3 impact of mercury because it does not distinguish4 ethyl from other forms.5 Q Is it now your testimony that the porphyrin 6 test is not the most helpful test for determining if7 your patients are harmed by mercury?8 A As the science as evolved, we have continued 9 to use other measures also. What we have now that I10 didn't know about back then are also some inflammatory11 markers in urine specimens that look for co-existing12 inflammation, that, in addition, is very helpful, but13 I do continue to use the porphyrins quite a bit, yes.14 Q You mentioned testing for inflammatory 15 markers in urine. Who does that testing?16 A Dr. Nataf's lab does that testing, but we 17 are also able to get it from Metametrix and other labs18 probably that I don't know of.19 Q The porphyrin test is a test that you are 20 still ordering in your practice, is that right?21 A That's correct. 22 Q And it's a test that you are still using to 23 make clinical decisions regarding your patients24 treatment and care, is that accurate?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 8 of 2391463 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Yes, using it in context with the most 1 important part, which is the history of the child and2 the clinical appearance of the child.3 Q You testified yesterday that you could not 4 tell me how long after an exposure you would still5 consider the porphyrin test to be reliable.6 A That's correct. 7 Q If you're using the test to make treatment 8 decisions, you must have some idea of when the test is9 medically appropriate, wouldn't that be correct?10 A When I use the test, I am looking at the 11 impact of a particular child with regard to impact on12 a very crucial biochemical pathway at the time that I13 get that child. I don't have the advantage of getting14 him or her at a time that I can choose with regard to15 any exposures, and often I am trying to figure out16 what the exposures are.17 So, I think we have already established that 18 I'm not a toxicologist, so I don't want to venture19 beyond my area of expertise to speculate about how20 that test is constructed in terms of the question that21 counsel asked me. But I am still able to use it, I22 think, as a clinically valuable tool as long as I use23 it in the context of the individual patient, the24 clinical history, and other supporting laboratory data25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 9 of 2391464 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888that might be consistent with what I see on the1 porphyrin test.2 Q You wouldn't order that test unless it was 3 medically appropriate or clinically indicated, is that4 accurate?5 A Unless my judgment was that that was the 6 case, yes.7 Q And how long after an exposure, in your 8 judgment, would you personally not order a porphyrin9 test based on a belief that it would no longer be a10 reliable measure of, or reliable evidence that your11 patient was harmed by mercury?12 A I do not have that number and do not wish to 13 speculate about it.14 Q So you are unwilling to provide me with a 15 timeframe on that question?16 A No. I'm willing to provide you with any 17 information that I feel is within the realm of my18 expertise as an clinician. It seems to me that I'm19 being asked to venture into territory that we've20 already established through DOJ's help is not my area21 of expertise, i.e., toxicology and laboratory science. 22 So, I wish to be able to confine my testimony to areas23 of clinical expertise.24 Q But you do basic clinical decisions based on 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 10 of 2391465 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888your interpretation of the those test results, is that1 right?2 A That is correct. 3 Q Doctor, you included in your William Mead 4 report a paragraph that discussed neuroinflammation,5 and this is on pages 7 to 8 of your report.6 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: In which case? 7 MR. JOHNSON: In the William Mead case. 8 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: In the Mead case. 9 THE WITNESS: Can you tell me the bolded 10 title on that page because mine isn't paginated?11 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Analysis of 12 William Mead's Clinical and Laboratory Evidence --13 THE WITNESS: Thank you. 14 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: -- With 15 Regard to the Medical Literature.16 MR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Special Master. 17 That's it.18 THE WITNESS: Okay. Thank you. 19 BY MR. JOHNSON: 20 Q All right. And in that paragraph you refer 21 to the Vargas article, correct?22 A That is correct. 23 Q Okay, and that's Petitioner's Master List 24 No. 69.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 11 of 2391466 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888You also cite to the Burbacher study in that 1 paragraph for a statement regarding persistent2 inorganic mercury in the brain. Is it your opinion3 that persistent inorganic mercury in the brain causes4 neuroinflammation?5 A It is my opinion that persistent inorganic 6 mercury has the capacity to cause neuroinflammation in7 the brain.8 Q Is it your opinion that persistent inorganic 9 mercury in the brain causes neuroinflammation?10 A It's my opinion that persistent inorganic 11 mercury is consistent with causing neuroinflammation.12 Q When you gave your deposition in the 13 Blackwell case you were asked about the Vargas 14 article. Do you recall that?15 A Not specifically, but I'm sure that I was. 16 Q Okay. And at that time, in January of last 17 year, you testified that you did not rely on the18 neuroinflammation work for your opinion, is that19 correct?20 A At that -- 21 Q And right now for the record we are showing 22 you a page from your deposition, and the question that23 you were asked was, \"Do you rely in any way in any of24 Dr. Zimmerman's work for your opinions in this case?\"25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 12 of 2391467 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Now, Dr. Zimmerman was a co-author on the 1 Vargas article, is that right?2 A That's correct. 3 Q Okay. And if you could just read what your 4 answer to that question was.5 A \"I have read Dr. Zimmerman's work, so it 6 becomes a body of knowledge that I have used to7 formulate my opinions. But I don't specifically8 recall any particular thing that he has as an9 individual contributed that I rely on for the opinion10 in the Blackwell case,\" which was a very different 11 type of case.12 I'm sorry. I should clarify for the Court. 13 The last clause that I said was clarification and not14 reading directly from the record.15 Q The Blackwell case did involve an allegation 16 that thimerosal-containing vaccines, among other17 exposure, contributed or caused a child's autism, is18 that right?19 A That's correct. 20 Q And in fact in the deposition you were asked 21 if you disagreed with Dr. Zimmerman on any other22 points, and you testified that you disagreed with his23 conclusions, primarily his lack of concern with24 environmental issues and thimerosal toxicity, is that25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 13 of 2391468 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888correct?1 A First of all, at the time that I did that 2 deposition, I had relatively limited experience with3 Dr. Zimmerman's body of work with regard to4 neuroinflammation other than having read the Vargas5 paper.6 Secondly, I had met him at the Autism 7 Treatment Center and at the Autism Treatment Network8 meeting, and at that time, based on a comment that I9 had heard him say in the public forum, it did not seem10 that he shared some of the concerns that my colleagues11 and I did. I had very limited exposure to him so I12 don't know, in fact, if that was really the case or13 just my interpretation about what he said.14 But as time has gone on I have re-read his 15 work. I had not re-read his work just prior to this16 deposition since it was not part of the emphasis in17 that particular case. So as is my practice, I was not18 wanting to comment about details that I did not19 recall.20 Q Since hearing Dr. Zimmerman make the comment 21 that led you to believe that he didn't have concerns22 about thimerosal causing autism, have you spoken to23 Dr. Zimmerman since that time?24 A Only a couple of weeks ago. One of my 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 14 of 2391469 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888patients who had been a normal baby up until his 18-1 month shots had had a cardiac arrest and a seizure on2 the day of the shots. He was air-lifted to the local3 university and the parents were told that the cardiac4 arrest and the seizures could not have had anything to5 do with his immunizations.6 He subsequently went on to develop autism 7 and a very recalcitrant seizure disorder for which the8 neurologists at the University of Virginia were not9 able to help him with. Ultimately he came to me for10 management, and he had seizures that were so bad that11 I had to put him on a vagus nerve stimulator, which12 did decrease the amount of his seizures from several13 hundred per day to a relatively smaller amount,14 somewhere in the range of 10 to 25.15 About three weeks ago, he died, and he died 16 in his sleep, which I presume was due to perhaps an17 unrecognized seizure that I had not been able to18 control.19 So I asked the family if they would consider 20 donating his brain for analysis, and because at that21 time I had read Dr. Zimmerman's work, I had just22 within the last few weeks read of his work in the23 Poling case. I had had the opportunity to look at his 24 body of work and the folks at Hopkins in more detail.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 15 of 2391470 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888I called him and asked him if he would work 1 on Dillon's brain, and he said that what I should do2 is to have the brain donated to the Autism Tissue3 Brain Bank, and that he and his colleagues, as well as4 other scientists who had interest in this area, would5 be glad to work on it. That has actually been my only6 conversation with Dr. Zimmerman since I saw him at the7 Autism Treatment Network since, I think, 2004.8 Q I take it the discussion did not involve Dr. 9 Zimmerman's thoughts on whether thimerosal causes10 autism, is that accurate?11 A The conversation I had about my dead 12 patient?13 Q Yes. 14 A That is correct. 15 Q So you have heard nothing from Dr. Zimmerman 16 since the time that you heard him make the comment17 that led you to believe that he does not have any18 concerns about thimerosal causing autism, you're heard19 nothing from him since that time that would cause you20 to think that he's changed his mind on that issue, is21 that right?22 A I haven't heard anything from him directly, 23 no.24 Q And you would agree that the Vargas article 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 16 of 2391471 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888you refer to does not mention thimerosal or mercury as1 a cause of a neuroinflammation, is that correct?2 A I would agree. 3 Q You have talked about neuroinflammation in 4 some of your talks at Defeat Autism Now conferences,5 is that right?6 A That's correct. 7 Q And according to your CV, you gave a talk in 8 Jacksonville, Florida, in late January 2007, and I9 want to show you a cover slide from a presentation and10 ask you if this is --11 A Yes. 12 Q -- the presentation that you gave. 13 A Yes. 14 Q On the slide from that presentation titled 15 \"Vargas Research\" --16 A I'm sorry. Can you tell me the date of that 17 lecture again?18 Q I believe it was late January 2007. I can 19 be more specific.20 A Okay. That's close enough. I just needed 21 to know the year.22 Q It was about the same time that you gave 23 your deposition in the Blackwell case. 24 A Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 17 of 2391472 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And you note on the slide titled \"Vargas 1 Research\" that the Vargas team \"found evidence against2 an immune response mounted primarily against brain or3 agents within brain.\"4 Does that mean they found evidence against 5 that autoimmune process?6 A I'd like with the permission of the Special 7 Masters to expand a little bit on this slide.8 The first point was no activation of 9 adaptive immunity, which is the sort of classic B or10 T-cell infiltration or immunoglobulin deposition.11 The second point is raising the possibility 12 that the innate immune response may have been mounted13 primarily against brain or agents within the brain at14 that time. That was some evidence against at that15 point in time as science continues to march forward.16 Q And I believe my question was, is it your 17 understanding that Vargas found evidence against an18 autoimmune process and autism?19 A No. 20 Q And then on a later slide in that same 21 presentation you indicate that neuroinflammation may22 be secondary to GI inflammation. Is that right?23 A That's correct. 24 Q So, at least when you gave this presentation 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 18 of 2391473 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888it was not your hypothesis that inorganic mercury in1 the brain was causing neuroinflammation, is that2 correct?3 A The slides says there may be a link between 4 primary GI inflammation and secondary CNS immune5 activation and tissue injury. I still believe that to6 be the case. There is growing evidence to suggest7 that toxicity through byproducts or intermediates of8 diet and gut bacteria also play a role in abnormal CNS9 function. I also believe that to be true.10 Q But there you're referring to playing a role 11 in abnormal CNS function and you don't say12 neuroinflammation, is that right?13 A That is correct. 14 Q Have you changed your hypothesis since 15 January of 2007?16 A I have continued to expand my knowledge 17 since January of 2007.18 Q Have you adopted Dr. Kinsbourne's model as 19 to his mechanism that he's proposed in this case?20 A I agree with Dr. Kinsbourne's model as 21 proposed in this case.22 Q Did you adopt his model after reading his 23 report that he prepared for this case?24 A I fear that there is a tendency to 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 19 of 2391474 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888oversimplify here, that we either have to believe (a)1 or (b) or (c), and that they are all mutually2 exclusive. My work as a clinician and my work with3 these scientists relies on a model where4 neuroinflammation may be a final common pathway that5 can result from various mechanisms, depending on the6 situation of the child, the vulnerability of the child7 at the time of whatever the insult is.8 I count myself among those who want to 9 remain open to the idea of following the science10 wherever it goes, and as best we can determine, as my11 colleagues from all these different fields --12 gastroenterology, toxicology, immunology -- they each13 contribute their body of information to inform this14 body of work.15 So, just as I hope that all of us will have 16 a better understanding of this in 2009 as we do now, I17 think we have a better understanding of it in 200818 than I did at the time of this lecture.19 Q Prior to reading Dr. Kinsbourne's report, 20 had you seen his specific model that proposes21 persistent inorganic mercury in the brain causing22 neuroinflammation leading to excess glutamate levels,23 had you seen that model anywhere before reading his24 report in this case?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 20 of 2391475 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A I had not seen that prior to Dr. 1 Kinsbourne's report as articulated by him.2 Q And you would agree that Dr. Kinsbourne's 3 specific hypothesis as stated in his report has not4 been published, is that correct?5 A I'm not aware that that's been published. 6 Q And it has obviously then not been peer 7 reviewed, is that correct?8 A I would assume that is correct. 9 Q And you would agree that it was generated 10 for purposes of litigation?11 A No, I would not agree. 12 Q And why would you disagree with that 13 statement?14 A Because I have no way of knowing what Dr. 15 Kinsbourne's mental processes were when he generated16 that report. I would be surprised, based on my17 limited knowledge of him which only began after this18 trial, that he would be so motivated.19 Q But you don't know one way or the other what 20 motivated --21 A That's correct. 22 Q -- Dr. Kinsbourne? 23 And I believe you said that it is still your 24 opinion that gut inflammation can cause25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 21 of 2391476 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888neuroinflammation, is that right?1 A I do think that in certain kids gut 2 inflammation can play a contributing role. There is3 actually published science to support that.4 Q And what science would that be? 5 A One of the papers is cited in my expert 6 report by Vojdani and colleagues looking at dietary7 antigens. Another body of work is by Dr. DiNucci at8 New Jersey Medical School looking again at dietary9 antigens. Another body of work would be the work of10 Paul Ashwood and his immunology colleagues at the MIND11 Institute. Another body of work would be my clinical12 patients who have been endoscoped in my practice by my13 local gastroenterologist, and show evidence of14 inflammation. Another body of work would be the Walsh15 paper which looked at inflammation of the gut and16 secondary effects on the brain. And on the spur of17 the moment that is what I can give you.18 Q Would Dr. Wakefield's work be included in 19 that body of science?20 A I am influenced by Dr. Wakefield's work. 21 That is correct.22 Q Is there a reason that you didn't mention 23 his work?24 A He has ironically just returned from a very 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 22 of 2391477 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888intensive investigation, and I am in this courtroom1 instead of being at the IMFAR meeting where some of2 his current science will be presented on this very3 day.4 Q And since you bring up IMFAR, I noted that 5 you've mentioned that you're here instead of being6 there, and I just wanted to say I hope you didn't miss7 it on our account because we had actually agreed that8 you could testify next week to allow you to go.9 A And next week I'm in Chicago educating 10 doctors, but I do appreciate that. Thank you.11 Q Sure. Doctor, what clinical evidence of 12 neuroinflammation can you point to in William Mead's13 case?14 A By the very definition, neuroinflammation 15 does not have good peripheral markers. This is the16 biggest problem for us as clinicians because, to the17 best of my knowledge, the body of work that looks at18 neuroinflammation actually makes a point of saying19 that peripheral markers are difficult to find, and20 certainly clinically available peripheral markers are,21 to my knowledge, nonexistent at this point. Let me22 give you an example.23 In the Vargas paper, they looked at CSF, and 24 all the tools that I would have available to me as a25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 23 of 2391478 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888clinician -- glucose levels, protein levels, cell1 counts, culture -- would not be informative. The2 things that they found that were abnormal are these3 very exquisite immunologic markers that are not4 typically available in community labs.5 So, for example, they found that interferon 6 gamma was vastly, vastly increased. I want to say it7 was like 200-fold increase, and so that was part of8 what they used to look at the issue of innate versus9 adaptive immunity, and so that in a clinical research10 setting was very helpful to them, but I have no way of11 getting that.12 When we find high inflammatory markers, the 13 ones we have clinically available frequently don't14 tell us where the inflammation is, and so I am left15 with wondering if it's neuroinflammation or gut16 inflammation or potentially other systems in the body17 that are affected.18 So, we are forced to try to help these 19 children without the lab evidence that would help us20 determine if they do have neuroinflammation, and John21 Green back in 2001 was even more hampered because the22 laboratory evidence available for him then was even23 more restrictive. That was seven years ago now. So24 it's entirely true that we don't have good markers25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 24 of 2391479 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888peripherally to determine this, and that's one of the1 big problems.2 Q So the short answer to my question is that 3 you can't point to any clinical evidence of4 neuroinflammation in William Mead's medical records,5 is that right?6 A That is correct. 7 Q And the same would be true for Jordan King, 8 is that correct?9 A That is correct. 10 Q Doctor, your training is in general 11 pediatrics, is that right?12 A That's correct. 13 Q And you do not have subspecialty training in 14 any particular area, is that right?15 A That's correct. 16 Q You're not a neurologist? 17 A That's correct. 18 Q And do you have any formal training in 19 neurological disorders?20 A No. 21 Q And you're not a clinical child 22 psychologist, is that right?23 A That's correct. 24 Q Okay, and you're not a psychiatrist, is that 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 25 of 2391480 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888right?1 A That's correct. 2 Q Your only board certification is in 3 pediatrics, is that correct?4 A That's correct. 5 Q What training do you have in diagnosing 6 autism?7 A The training that I have received as being a 8 general pediatrician, and the things I learned when I9 was asked to write a book chapter for medical students10 on developmental and behavioral pediatrics, which11 included autism, and on immunology and allergies.12 Q In your practice, what method do you use to 13 diagnose a child with an ASD?14 A I actually request that patients are 15 independently diagnosed. My preference is that they16 go to a place like the TEACH Center in North Carolina,17 which is not too far from me, or one of the university18 centers, or to a neuropsychiatrist. My preference is19 that they have an ADOS or an ADIR to formally make the20 diagnosis, and that they undergo speech evaluations21 and motor evaluations, and psychological testing and22 intellectual testing.23 Then in my practice I basically then just 24 determine by using the records that I am given to see25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 26 of 2391481 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888if those diagnoses seem to be appropriate.1 Q So you do not independently diagnose ASDs, 2 you just confirm other professionals' diagnoses, is3 that correct?4 A That's correct, and then I go on to try to 5 take care of the kids medically.6 Q What is your definition of regressive 7 autism?8 A A case in which there is a clearly 9 documented time of normal development, followed by a10 clear loss of developmental milestones, and then the11 emergence of autistic symptoms.12 Q Let's start with the period of normal 13 development. How do you confirm normal development14 prior to regression?15 A I look at records supplied by the primary 16 care physician, and I take a very careful history from17 the parents, and I ask the parents to bring, when18 available, baby books or other contemporaneous19 documentation of their children's landmarks.20 There are very clearly delineated month by 21 month developmental markers in language, gross motor,22 fine motor, and social skills, and primary care23 physicians, whether they are pediatricians or family24 physicians, are taught to ask those questions at each25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 27 of 2391482 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888visit and do a record, so we are able to document1 normal development in that way.2 Q Do you ever use videos? 3 A In my clinical practice? 4 Q Yes. 5 A I am given videos by parents, but it is very 6 time-consuming for me to review the videos, so I7 typically do not use that if I have all these other8 measures that I've described.9 Q Now I want to talk about the documentation 10 of regression. Are there objective measures that you11 use to determine that a child actually regressed?12 A One objective measure is whether or not they 13 lost words. Another objective measure is whether or14 not they lost motor skills. Another objective measure15 is whether or not they developed stereotypic16 repetitive behaviors. Another objective measure would17 be whether or not they lost social reciprocity.18 Q Is that all? 19 A I think so. 20 Q Okay. Let's start with losing words. 21 A Okay. 22 Q First of all, how many words must a child 23 have had before the regression?24 A I do not have a specific number. It 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 28 of 2391483 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888obviously depends on the age of the child and the1 developmental stage of the child.2 Q Let's assume a 15-month-old child. How many 3 words would you expect that child to have?4 A Anywhere between eight and 15 typically, but 5 if there is a child who developed language late, and6 only had three words, and then at some point in the7 future lost all of those words, that would be very8 concerning to me.9 So again, I'm going to resist the idea that 10 we can on a clinical basis make a definition of11 regressive autism by an arbitrary number.12 Q How about for a 21-month-old child, how many 13 words would you expect that child to have?14 A That's very variable. I would expect -- the 15 normal classic milestone is two-word phrases at 1816 months of age. Some kids at 21 months have 50 to 100-17 word vocabularies. Some kids may have 25 to 50-word18 vocabularies.19 Q Does it matter at all to you how the child 20 is using the words?21 A Yes. 22 Q In what way? 23 A If a child is only using a word to repeat or 24 is doing it over and over and over, that is concerning25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 29 of 2391484 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888to me. A more normal pattern at 21 months would be a1 child who is using words to name different objects.2 Q And how many words must a child lose for you 3 to consider it a regression?4 A I do not have a specific number of words. 5 Again, it depends on what their developmental status6 was, and then that they lost words.7 Q In terms of the other areas, the motor 8 skills, the stereotypic behaviors and the social9 reciprocity, are you relying primarily on the parent10 reports in order to determine their progress, the11 child's progress in meeting those milestones and12 engaging in those behaviors prior to the regression?13 A I'm sorry. Could you say that again? I 14 missed part of your question.15 Q Yes. In addition to the language, you have 16 identified motor skills, stereotypic behaviors and17 social reciprocity as three other objective measures18 that you look at to determine whether regression had19 occurred. And my question was whether you were20 relying primarily on parent reports of the child's21 behavior prior to the regression to confirm that none22 of that existed prior to the alleged regression.23 A I do place a huge amount of weight on the 24 parents' report, but we also have these25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 30 of 2391485 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888contemporaneously-generated documents by the1 pediatrician, and typically when I get a referral and2 have the pediatric records sent, I see a pattern where3 the pediatrician is checking off, you know, coos,4 babbles, jargons, saying mama, dada, has eight words,5 putting two words together, and then at some point the6 records start saying things like no words, lost words,7 not talking the way he used to. That, to me, is8 reliable evidence in addition to the parents' history.9 Q And all those examples you just gave dealt 10 with language, and I was actually talking about the11 other measures, the motor skills, the stereotypic --12 A Oh, I'm sorry. 13 Q -- behaviors and the social reciprocity. 14 A So my -- sorry. 15 Q Are those things normally noted in the 16 medical records?17 A That is correct. 18 Q Okay. 19 A So my same statements about language would 20 also apply to motor, and in fact with motor there are21 two different streams of development. One would be22 gross motor. One would be fine motor. So when you23 look in the records, you will see things for gross24 motor like rolled over at four months, sat up at six25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 31 of 2391486 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888months, pulled up at nine months, began walking around1 a year. And for fine motor you will see things like2 hands midline to mouth at four months, transfers3 object at six months, pincer grasp at one year,4 pointing around one year. So that is typically5 recorded in the pediatrician's record, as well as6 remembered fairly well by parents when their child is7 young. It's more difficult, you know, years later.8 So we did motor. Now the next one was 9 social reciprocity?10 Q Sure. 11 A Okay. So social reciprocity at two weeks 12 the baby should smile at the mom and look at her --13 I'm sorry -- should look at the mom in the eye. At14 six weeks the baby should start smiling. There should15 be interactive play that continues through the first16 year of life, and later on it includes things like17 picking up the hands when they see the mom walk into18 the room so they can be picked up, and involves around19 nine months of age to 12 months of age these20 reciprocal games like peek-a-boo, for example.21 So again, these are things most parent at 22 the time are able to tell you, and most doctors are23 noting those signs in their records. So, you are24 also, I think, able to document fairly clearly when25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 32 of 2391487 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the doctor starts saying, you know, no longer looks at1 mom, or eye contact with parent diminished, or not2 using gesture to be lifted. Those are all signs of3 social reciprocity.4 Then I think the last thing -- 5 Q Let me interrupt you. Does wanting to be 6 held, is that also a sign of social reciprocity?7 A Wanting to be held is a tough one because 8 babies differ in how much they like that. Most babies9 do like to be held, but if you have a child that likes10 being held and cuddled, and then quits liking that, I11 would include that as a loss of that behavior.12 Q Okay. 13 A And then are we doing stereotypic or 14 repetitive next?15 Q That's right, let's do that one. 16 A So, typically, even though infants will do 17 some things over and over when they are playing with a18 toy. They typically have a broad range of interests. 19 So for example, a baby who is still lying on his back20 and you put one of those little swing set kind of toys21 where it dangles, the various objects, usually you're22 able to get the baby to play with one, and then23 another, and then go back to another one.24 When you see the emergence of stereotypic 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 33 of 2391488 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888behaviors, the story I hear is, you know, I bought him1 all these toys and he used to play with everything,2 but now all he wants to do is line up his trains, or3 you know, he used to love playing with his BRIO set,4 but now all he wants to do is flip the light switch5 off and on over and over and over, or we can't get him6 to -- he used to eat with a fork and spoon. Now all7 he wants to do is eat with his hands over and over and8 over again. That's actually a little bit of a bad9 example because it also includes motor, but you get10 the point.11 Q All right. I think that covers it. 12 Let me ask you this. In your practice do 13 you use the term \"clearly regressive autism\"?14 A I do. 15 Q How is that distinct from just regressive 16 autism?17 A Let me get some data for a second. I 18 essentially am using those terms in my clinic19 interchangeably because when I say \"regressive20 autism\", I want there to be a situation in my mind21 where it was a clear regression as I've articulated,22 and clearly that's a clinical judgment.23 I think I mentioned yesterday that in my 24 population I actually see a lot of those patients25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 34 of 2391489 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888because of referral bias, but we also try to very1 clearly document the kids who have no regression, and2 that works out to be about 35 percent of my patients.3 So, for me to call it regressive autism, I 4 really want it to be clear, and one of the reasons for5 that is it helps me inform my judgments about how I'm6 going to treat that child because a differential7 diagnosis in my mind for a clear regression is quite8 different from the differential diagnosis for9 something that is either present from birth or there10 is no clear regression, so that the possibility at11 least has to be entertained that maybe there were12 signs that could have been missed by the parents13 because they were understandably in a state of denial14 that something bad could be happening to their baby.15 Q So in any case or for any patient in which 16 the symptoms either appeared early or gradually, you17 would not consider that a case of regressive autism,18 is that right?19 A That's correct. 20 Q Doctor, you testified that the DAN model 21 that you employ is collaborative, is that right?22 A That's correct. 23 Q And the parents are involved in the process? 24 A That's correct. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 35 of 2391490 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And you testified, I believe, that you view 1 your particular expertise as in taking histories, is2 that right?3 A That's correct. 4 Q Prior to preparing your report in this case, 5 did you interview William Mead's mother or father?6 A No, I did not. 7 Q And did you interview Jordan King's mother 8 or father?9 A No, I did not. 10 Q So you did not take your own histories prior 11 to preparing your reports in these cases?12 A That's correct, and that's why I was so glad 13 to have the opportunity to hear them here a couple14 days ago.15 Q Did you personally evaluate Will Mead prior 16 to preparing your report?17 A No, I did not. 18 Q Did you perform a physical examination of 19 him?20 A No, I did not. 21 Q And did you personally evaluate Jordan King 22 prior to preparing your report?23 A No, I did not. 24 Q And I take it you did not perform a physical 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 36 of 2391491 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888examination of Jordan either, is that right?1 A That's correct. 2 Q And I believe you said yesterday that you 3 didn't review any of the videos that the family4 provided until last Thursday, is that right?5 A That's right. 6 Q So would it be fair to say that your 7 opinions as stated in your report were based on a8 review of the medical records?9 A At the time I was asked to generate the 10 report, that is absolutely correct.11 Q Okay. In the Blackwell case, you only 12 testified on the issue of general causation, is that13 right?14 A You know, I don't remember, to tell you the 15 truth.16 Q You don't remember whether you offered an 17 opinion as to whether the plaintiff in that case,18 whether his autism was specifically caused by mercury?19 A You know, I'm sorry. I really don't 20 remember much of that day.21 Q Okay. We can refresh your recollection. 22 We'll show you the portion of the transcripts from23 your deposition where you were asked whether you would24 be offering an opinion as to the plaintiffs, and if25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 37 of 2391492 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888you could just read what you answered to that1 question.2 A I said, \"Not for a specific case because I 3 would never render such a specific opinion without the4 opportunity to evaluate the child, interrogate the5 parents, do a physical exam, and review the laboratory6 data.\"7 Q Doctor, what makes these cases different 8 than the Blackwell case? 9 A I guess part of the difference is that I 10 know John Green well and I understand how he11 practices, and how careful he is, and he's actually12 been doing this work longer than I have. So when I13 see his physical exam and am able to read his notes,14 and see how he's thinking, I am better able to make a15 judgment.16 And my understanding in this case is that I 17 was being asked to provide an expert opinion as18 opposed to testifying as the treating physician. So I19 thought that in the vaccine court that was a20 distinction, and the role I was being asked to play21 here was not that of the treating physician, but as an22 expert in clinical pediatrics.23 Q Do you believe that your opinions in these 24 cases are subject to a lower standard than what you25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 38 of 2391493 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888would apply in your clinical practice?1 A Is there a way you can rephrase that 2 question?3 Q The answer that you just provided was that 4 the reason that you didn't feel it was necessary to do5 these things that you said in the Blackwell case, you 6 would be required to do in order to offer the opinion7 that you've offered is that you weren't being offered8 here as a treating physician but rather as an expert.9 And so I'm asking if you believe that your 10 opinion as an expert is subject to a lower standard11 than what you would apply in your clinical practice.12 MR. POWERS: Just a clarification. Is it 13 the opinion in the reports or the opinion that she's14 testified to?15 BY MR. JOHNSON: 16 Q I wasn't aware that there was a distinction, 17 but let's start out with the report.18 A It was my understanding that in vaccine 19 court the idea was to make it a nonadversarial, family20 friendly funded compensation mechanism to which I have21 been contributing since the eighties in order to22 identify and compensate children where there was23 biologic plausibility that vaccines, some component24 might have contributed to their health problems.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 39 of 2391494 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888In a case like the Blackwell case, I 1 actually resisted for many years doing cases in the2 other court system because that clearly is an3 adversarial situation, and the stakes are very high. 4 So I would say that I was under the idea that there5 was a different standard, not lower standard, I think6 carries a disparaging tone, but I thought that vaccine7 court and civil court were different situations.8 Q Do you believe the decisions in vaccine 9 cases should be based on reliable science?10 A I do. 11 Q You're relying on notations in the medical 12 records for your conclusion that William Mead and13 Jordan King experienced regression, is that correct?14 A I'm sorry. Say that again. 15 Q You're relying on notations in the medical 16 records for your conclusion that William Mead and17 Jordan King experienced regression, is that right?18 A At the time of the report, yes. At the time 19 of my testimony, I also have the advantage of having20 heard the parents and seen the videos.21 Q Okay. So you're now also taking into 22 consideration those other facts that were not23 available to you when you prepared your report?24 A That's correct. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 40 of 2391495 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q In your opinion, when did William Mead's 1 regression occur?2 A It appeared to emerge between 15 and 18 3 months of age.4 Q And what are you relying on for that 5 calculation of the timeframe when regression occurred?6 A The medical records that noted his 7 milestones and loss thereof.8 Q When did, in your opinion, Jordan King's 9 regression occurred?10 A Emerging between 15 to 20 months. 11 Q And again if I could just ask you what you 12 were relying on for that calculation.13 A At the time of this, the medical records. 14 Q Is there a specific record in either case 15 that you can point me to that you found particularly16 compelling or conclusive on that issue?17 A We showed, I thought, yesterday the records 18 from the pediatrician that showed before and after. 19 You know, before the skill was there, after it wasn't. 20 I also relied on Dr. Green's initial intake on both21 children which I don't have the exact page reference22 for, but I'm sure Scott could find it if we need to do23 that.24 Q Okay. And we don't need to. I was just 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 41 of 2391496 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888wondering off the top of your head if you knew.1 Doctor, does it matter for your opinions in 2 these cases when the regression occurred?3 A All the regressions that -- well, let me not 4 say \"all\" in medicine because there is always the5 exception that proves the rules. The pattern that we6 see clinically is that the regressions are typically7 in the second year of life.8 Having said that, I've also seen regressions 9 in children, and this is atypical for the diagnosis of10 autism, but I have had children develop autistic type11 behaviors after the age of three, but for purposes of12 the classic picture I would say between -- somewhere13 in the second year of life or thereafter.14 Q For the children who develop autistic 15 behaviors after the age of three, would they be16 diagnosed as autistic?17 A No, they would not be able to be diagnosed 18 as autistic because the criteria as originally set out19 require under the age of three, not over.20 Q In your opinion, how much thimerosal would a 21 child need to be exposed to before it caused autistic22 regression?23 A It depends on a huge number of factors, so 24 I'm not able to give you a number.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 42 of 2391497 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Okay. Let's use the specific cases that 1 we've got available to us as examples, and we will2 start with William Mead, and you state in your report3 that he received 187.5 micrograms of ethyl mercury by4 the time he was seven months old.5 A Right. 6 Q And that is based on three Hepatitis B 7 vaccines, three DTaP vaccines, and two Hib vaccines,8 is that correct?9 A Yes. 10 Q Or I'm sorry, three Hib vaccines. 11 Do you know whether the Hib vaccines that 12 William Mead received were from single-dose vials or13 multi-dose vials?14 A Oh, actually that's a good point. I do not 15 know.16 Q Okay, because -- 17 A So it's possible that the numbers I 18 calculated are different. I mean, would have been19 different had I had that information.20 Q Because am I correct that single-dose vials 21 do not contain thimerosal, is that right?22 A That is correct. So if there is evidence 23 with the Court's permission that -- it's unusual for24 them to be single-dose vials, but if they were, I25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 43 of 2391498 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888would like the opportunity to revise the estimates1 downward based on that new information.2 Q And it would be revised downward by 75 3 micrograms, is that correct?4 A Yes. 5 Q And did you hear Dr. Deth testify? I 6 believe you were here for his testimony the other day,7 is that right?8 A I was here for his testimony. 9 Q And did you hear him testify that he 10 believes there is a threshold concentration of11 inorganic mercury in the brain necessary to cause12 autism?13 A Let me pull my notes on his testimony. 14 Actually, at this point in time we don't have a way, I15 presume, of pulling the transcript up because it16 hasn't been done yet, is that correct? Okay.17 Okay, what I see are notes that for 18 neurologic symptoms, how much in brain concentration19 dependant upon effects, sub-nanomoler. I don't know20 if that was what you're referring to. Maybe you could21 give me the sentence that he said.22 Q Let's go at it this way. You've stated that 23 William Mead received 187.5 micrograms of thimerosal24 by the time he was seven months old, is that right?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 44 of 2391499 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A That is correct. 1 Q And that you've testified that his 2 regression occurred between 15 and 18 months, is that3 right?4 A That's correct. 5 Q And he didn't receive any other thimerosal- 6 containing vaccines until he was 23 months, I believe,7 is that right?8 A I think that is correct. 9 Q Okay. So at the time that the regression 10 occurred according to you, he had received 187.511 micrograms of thimerosal.12 A Or less. 13 Q Or less. 14 A Yes. 15 Q But let's assume that he received 187.5. In 16 your opinion, is that amount sufficient to cause17 autistic regression?18 A It depends on the amount of inorganic 19 mercury that resulted in his brain or affected as yet20 undetermined systems. But to the best of my21 knowledge, that amount would be sufficient because we22 have no known or proven safe level of mercury, which23 is a known neurotoxin and has other bad effects. So24 yes, that would be a sufficient amount.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 45 of 2391500 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q You say there is no safe level. Could one 1 thimerosal-containing vaccine expose the child to2 enough ethyl mercury to cause regressive autism?3 A I actually think that's theoretically 4 possible depending on the situation of the child at5 the time. I'm concerned that if the child, for6 example, had birth trauma or was ill at the time or7 had oxidative stress or if you had a bunch of genetic8 predispositions as Jill James has outlined with regard9 to, you know, reduced folic carrier and transcavalimen10 to enzymes or COMT enzymes or MTHFR, or if there were11 other factors that we still don't even know about,12 that the vulnerability of the child at the time to me13 can play a huge role, and that's why I'm so reluctant14 to pick some number. So, I think it is theoretically15 possible that one TCV could harm a given child.16 Q Am I correct that in the Blackwell case you 17 actually testified that even trace amounts of18 thimerosal in vaccines could lead to autism, is that19 right?20 A I may have said that. I don't recall 21 specifically.22 Q Do you believe that as you are sitting here 23 today?24 A I am very concerned about trace amounts even 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 46 of 2391501 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888as I sit here today.1 Q Are you aware of any studies that show that 2 trace amounts of thimerosal in vaccines cause any3 neurological disorders?4 A Examinations in children or animals -- 5 Q Any studies at all. 6 A -- or anywhere? 7 Q In trace amounts. 8 A No. 9 Q And do you know of any medical organization 10 that would agree with the idea that trace amounts of11 thimerosal could lead to autism?12 A No. 13 Q Doctor, is your opinion in this case that 14 thimerosal-containing vaccines contribute to autism,15 is that limited to regressive autism?16 A I actually -- I actually don't know the 17 answer to that yet. I am still -- the pathology and18 my clinical experience tends to make me think that19 that's the case, but I'm also concerned about prenatal20 exposures to thimerosal, and so I'm concerned that for21 the kids whose mother got Baro, for example, with high22 does of thimerosal, or who got flu vaccines in23 pregnancy, that we may start seeing a shift in the24 pattern where because of that exposure during fetal25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 47 of 2391502 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888development we also could be affecting children that1 don't have a classic period of normal development.2 But I think obviously the science is in its 3 infancy here, so I can't be sure about whether it's4 just regressive or potentially also emerging symptoms5 within the first year, or even at birth.6 Q As you know, one of the factors that the 7 Special Masters are required to consider is whether8 the onset of symptoms occurs in a medically9 appropriate timeframe following vaccination.10 A Yes. 11 Q In your opinion, what is a medically 12 appropriate timeframe for the onset of regressive13 autism after a child receives a thimerosal-containing14 vaccine?15 A Yes, this is a difficult issue because as 16 the neuropathology as best we know at this point in17 time shows the neuroinflammation increases over time,18 and in a lot of the papers in animal models, which are19 obviously limited, there can be neuroinflammation20 documented and the animals aren't even particularly21 symptomatic at that time.22 So, it's a little bit different in my mind 23 from the classic vaccine injuries you all have had to24 make decisions on in the past because then we were25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 48 of 2391503 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888looking at things like an acute pertussis reaction1 where the onset was within seven days or so. Here our2 concern is that the seed is planted, and that it's a3 period of months or years, you know, as yet to be4 undetermined.5 If the neuropathology shows that the 6 inorganic mercury is going to last for decades, it's7 very hard to put a very tight timeframe on this. One8 of my concerns was when we originally evaluated9 vaccines for safety we tended to do very short follow10 ups looking for acute reactions, and unless there is11 something that I'm not aware of I'm not aware of12 studies that look beyond 21 days for acute reactions.13 What we're concerned about is chronic 14 reactions that are emerging over time, and emerging in15 different timelines, depending on the individual16 child. So, I really have a hard time putting an upper17 cap on the timeframe.18 Q You just stated that it's your understanding 19 that the neuroinflammation increases over time. Did I20 understand you correctly?21 A Yes. 22 Q What's causing the neuroinflammation to 23 increase over time?24 A I have no idea, or let me clarify that 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 49 of 2391504 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888response. That is for a neuropathologist to1 determine, so I would defer to what is learned about2 this subject by them as time marches on.3 Q By neuropathologists? 4 A Right, or others who have expertise in that 5 field that goes beyond mine.6 Q Doctor, in your report you discuss the 7 concept of genetic susceptibility.8 A I did. 9 Q Do you believe there is a genetic 10 susceptibility to mercury?11 A I believe there are many constellations of 12 genetic susceptibilities that would render a13 particular individual more susceptible to mercury.14 Q Does every child who has an ASD cause or 15 contributed to by thimerosal have a genetic16 susceptibility to the effects of mercury?17 A In the sense -- well, I actually don't know 18 the answer to that question because, first of all, we19 have not obviously checked every child, and that's20 reaching beyond the science. But the state of the21 science at this point suggests some very intriguing22 possibilities about genetic abnormalities in23 biochemical pathways and enzyme function that would be24 expected to render children at greater risk.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 50 of 2391505 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888So what they are, I think, remains to 1 somewhat be determined. I try never to say, you know,2 always or never in medicine, so I would not want to3 say every child.4 Q What markers do you look for to determine if 5 a child has a genetic susceptibility to mercury?6 A There are indirect markers and it depends a 7 lot on the finances of the parents. One of the most8 helpful ways to try to evaluate that very difficult9 clinical problem is to look at methylation genomics. 10 That involves single nucleotide polymorphisms involving methylation and12 transsulfuration and glutathione production.13 So, for the parents who are financially able 14 to afford the tests or who are interested in doing15 those tests, we can look at things like16 methylenetetrahydrofolate enzymes or17 methionine synthase-related enzymes, the transcobalamin II19 enzymes, or catecholamine O methyl transferase20 enzymes, or glutathione S transferase enzymes. Those21 are all in that pathway that impact on the body's22 ability to make glutathione and mobilize mercury and23 other heavy metals.24 So, as Dr. James' work has shown, various 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 51 of 2391506 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888combinations of those genetic predispositions will1 lead to varying elevations in the odds ratio or the2 risk factor for that particular child. So, you know,3 sometimes it doubles the risk, sometimes it triples4 the risk, sometimes it's even more, but this field is5 really in its infancy, and I will much better be able6 to answer that question after Dr. James does her7 upcoming NIH study where she is able to look at huge8 numbers of kids.9 The things I've just mentioned are on, you 10 know, the population we have studied so far. That may11 well change as we go into larger populations.12 Q Now, you just mentioned a single nucleotide 13 polymorphisms, is that right?14 A That's correct. 15 Q And in shorthand, those are referred to as 16 SNPs, is that right?17 A That's correct. 18 Q So, I'm just going to call them SNPs because 19 it's easier.20 A I'd love to do that too. Thank you. 21 Q Okay. You have not personally done any 22 research on SNPs, is that right?23 A That is absolutely correct. 24 Q You're not a geneticist, is that correct? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 52 of 2391507 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Absolutely correct. 1 Q So, you rely on the work of others for your 2 opinions regarding which SNPs may or may not be3 associated with genetic susceptibility, is that right?4 A I do. 5 Q You would agree that SNPs occur in a 6 significant percentage of the population, is that7 right?8 A I do. 9 Q They are not rare, is that right? 10 A We all have them, and that's what makes us - 11 - you know, I might be more susceptible to have12 cancer, you might be more susceptible to have13 hypertension. We all have them. That's exactly14 right.15 Q Okay. And specific SNPs vary across ethnic 16 groups, is that right?17 A That's also true. 18 Q And autism has an equal prevalence among 19 ethnic groups or across ethnic groups, is that right?20 A Is that true? 21 Q I'm asking you. 22 A I think there have actually been differences 23 across ethnic groups, and I can't recall the numbers,24 but I was not aware that it was equal across ethnic25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 53 of 2391508 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888groups. I guess that's something we could put on our1 list to try to find out.2 Q And not every person with a SNP is autistic, 3 is that correct?4 A Obviously correct. 5 Q You mentioned some studies that have been 6 done by Jill James. Are you aware that Jill James7 recently published a study in which she looked at8 polymorphisms on two different genes, the CPOX and the9 ALAD gene?10 A Oh, you know, I actually have not read that 11 one. When did that come out?12 Q It just came out recently. It's 13 Respondent's Master List No. 430, and we can provide14 you with a copy.15 A Okay. 16 Q Are you aware that Jill James and the other 17 authors on the study looked at those genes because18 polymorphisms and the CPOX gene had been associated19 with elevated blood mercury levels, and polymorphisms20 in the ALAD gene had been associated with elevated21 blood lead levels, is that right?22 A You know, I'm really very hesitant to 23 comment about a complex paper that I have not read. 24 Ordinarily, I would spend over an hour reading a paper25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 54 of 2391509 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888like this, so I don't know what the situation is when1 I'm being questioned about a paper I haven't read, but2 I would really rather not make opinions about it.3 Q So you don't know -- 4 A I don't know. 5 Q -- as you sit here that her hypothesis was 6 that a higher percent of autistic children would carry7 both of those polymorphisms?8 A I have not discussed this paper with her. 9 She is a great colleague of mine, but I have not10 talked to her about this one so I don't know.11 Q Okay. And you're obviously not aware that 12 her study found that the frequency of the ALAD13 polymorphism was higher among autistic subjects but14 the frequency of the CPOX polymorphism was actually15 lower in autistic subjects than in controls.16 A I did not know that but that does not 17 surprise me at all because one of the things that's18 been so great about Jill is that she has always, as19 she has talked to us, talked about the limitations of20 small numbers, and the fact that the SNPs are found in21 a lot of patients, and that only until she can get the22 kind of NIH funding to do huge numbers will we be able23 to make definitive comments about the genomics of24 this.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 2391510 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And let me just direct your attention to the 1 highlighted portions, and the second one in2 particular. Would you agree that at least in this3 study the authors concluded that lead, and not4 mercury, may be associated with autism?5 A Oh, yeah. I would definitely acknowledge 6 that because part of my concern in these kids that I7 tried to articulate in my report, and maybe did not do8 a good job of, is our concern for synergistic9 toxicities. It's clearly known that the lethal dose10 of two toxins put together tends to be higher than the11 individual lethal doses added linearly.12 So, if you will recall in, I believe, both 13 of the patients that are under review in this hearing14 they also were showing excretions of lead as well as15 mercury. So the co-existence of other toxicities is16 another risk factor in my mind, and so I maybe didn't17 clarify it enough, but when we're working up children18 for autism we also look at their lead history. We try19 to evaluate them for lead toxicity, and the porphyrins20 that we've talked about look for lead as well as21 mercury. The provoked urines that we do help the22 child excrete both lead and mercury, and the agent23 that we usually start out with is the one that's FDA24 approved for lead toxicity.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 56 of 2391511 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888So, I have in no way in this hearing tried 1 to negate or diminish the importance of other2 toxicities to neurologic impact on these children.3 Q Doctor, you would agree that at this time 4 there are no established biomarkers for genetic5 susceptibility to mercury, is that right?6 A I would agree to that, yes. It's research 7 that we need to do and we desperately need to develop8 biomarkers.9 Q I want to talk now about the mercury testing 10 in both of these cases, and I apologize because we're11 going to go through some of the same tests that you12 referred to yesterday, but I think it's going to be13 helpful to go through those again if you don't mind.14 A Okay. For my preparation, will you have 15 them on the screen?16 Q Yes. 17 A Okay. 18 Q Yes, we will. 19 First of all, let me just ask you what 20 testing methods do you believe reliably show mercury21 levels in a person, in a human?22 A I don't think that we have a great test to 23 reliably show the levels, and that's, I think, why we24 do a combination of the porphyrin testing, which will25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 57 of 2391512 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888show us impact of heavy metals on that crucial1 pathway, as well as trying to find the mercury or the2 lead or whatever it is.3 The problem is is that the easiest way to 4 find it, which would be a blood test, only works for5 acute toxicities. So when you're looking at either6 lead that is in the bones or mercury that is in the7 brain, the kidney, the fat and the liver, you have to8 use indirect measures, and the one that is useful is9 to do the provoked specimens and see if you can10 mobilize mercury to be excreted, implying that there11 is a body burden. But to my knowledge, it's very12 difficult to extrapolate from those tests to quantify13 a body burden.14 Q In the answer that you just gave you 15 referred to \"we use these tests,\" and I was wondering16 when you use the term \"we\", who are you referring to?17 A Primarily me and my colleagues that are 18 affiliated with the Autism Research Institute.19 Q So that doesn't include the general medical 20 community, is that correct?21 A No. I'm fairly certain that except in areas 22 where naturopaths and holistic practitioners are23 better accepted than they are in my conservative24 community, it's not something typically in the general25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 58 of 2391513 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888medical community. That would be fair.1 Q Haven't you stated in the past that blood, 2 hair and unprovoked urine testing are not reliable3 tests for infantile exposure to mercury?4 A Tell me that again. 5 Q Okay. 6 A Blood, yes. 7 Q Blood, hair and unprovoked urine are not 8 reliable tests for infantile exposure to mercury.9 A That is my belief. 10 Q Okay. And that is also stated in the DAN 11 consensus statement, is that right?12 A It may well be. 13 Q Okay. 14 A Again, it's been a long time since I worked 15 on that. I think that was five or six or seven years16 ago.17 Q Okay. So you helped write the consensus 18 statement, is that correct?19 A I reviewed it and signed off on it. 20 Q Okay. And the consensus statement indeed 21 says that blood, hair and unprovoked urine tests are22 not good methods for measuring mercury/metal toxicity23 in autism, is that right?24 A Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 59 of 2391514 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And you testified just a moment ago that 1 blood testing is only reliable for acute exposures. 2 Is that right?3 A That's correct. 4 Q So blood testing performed several weeks 5 after an exposure would no longer be a reliable6 measure of the exposure, is that correct?7 A That is my belief based on the studies of 8 Pichichero and others who have looked at the fact that9 most seems to go away within about seven days, if I10 recall the number correctly.11 Q What is your opinion on fecal testing? 12 A I have mixed feelings about fecal testing. 13 One value is that theoretically you mobilize a lot of14 mercury and excrete it in the feces, and so some15 doctors will use that, and certainly back in the late16 nineties and early two thousands that was one of the17 only things that we had.18 The more traditional way to look is through 19 the urinary testing. So again, I think it's a matter20 of putting the various pieces of laboratory data,21 realizing the inherent limitations in most of them and22 putting it together with a clinical picture.23 Q So there are limitations to fecal testing, 24 is that correct?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 60 of 2391515 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Yes, I'm sorry. That would have been a 1 short way to say it.2 Q Let's start and we'll switch up the order 3 since it always seems William Mead gets to go first,4 we'll start with Jordan King's mercury testing.5 A Okay. Just a second. Let me get his chart 6 open. Okay.7 Q All right. And let's start with the Jordan 8 King Exhibit 1 at 46, and this is a hair test from9 March 29, 2000, is that right?10 A That is right, but I don't recall that I 11 used the hair test in my presentation because that is12 something that I don't feel that I can rely on.13 Q Okay. And that's correct, you did not refer 14 to this yesterday, and as you said, is that because15 you do not think that the hair tests are reliable?16 A That is correct. 17 Q Okay. Did you hear Dr. Aposhian testify? 18 A No, I'm sorry, I did not. 19 Q Okay. Have you reviewed his report in this 20 case?21 A Gosh. Yeah, a long time ago back, probably 22 in the late fall.23 Q You're aware that Dr. Aposhian believes that 24 there is a mercury efflux disorder that may be causing25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 61 of 2391516 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888certain children to have problems excreting mercury,1 is that correct?2 A That is correct. 3 Q Have you personally formed an opinion about 4 whether there is such a thing as a mercury efflux5 disorder?6 A I do think that there are kids that have 7 difficulty excreting and mobilizing mercury. The hair8 tests that I think Vas was referring to there are baby9 hair tests at time of first haircut, and that is a10 totally different situation from the situation that I11 had here where the child was already two.12 I do think there is value in looking at the 13 infant hair test because they are often obtained at a14 time when we have a documented ongoing exposure to15 mercury through thimerosal-containing vaccines, and16 some of the initial studies that have been done17 initially by Dr. Holmes and Dr. Haley, and then18 replicated at MIT were showing that there were some19 infants that didn't seem to be able to mobilize20 mercury into their hair, and yet they had this known21 exposure, and they were able to mobilize other known22 exposures like lead or antimony or arsenic or23 whatever.24 So, in that subpopulation of kids when 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 62 of 2391517 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888you're looking at that specific timing, I think that1 hair analysis can be helpful, but not because mercury2 is high. In that case it's helpful because the3 mercury is low, and that, to the extent that hair is4 an excretory organ, and you know, it's not a primary5 excretory organ, so again that work has some6 limitations on it also.7 But to the extent to which it functions to 8 excrete mercury, having a low hair mercury in an9 infant at the time of a known exposure would be10 informative. These values, to me, later I don't feel11 like I can really rely on to make a judgment.12 Q So any of the hair tests in either one of 13 these cases you feel adds no support to your opinions14 in these cases?15 A I think that would have to be true, yes. 16 Q Following this test, and we're now going to 17 look at Jordan King Exhibit 12 at page 1, this is a18 blood test from April 24, 2000, and it revealed that19 his mercury levels were within the reference range, is20 that correct?21 A Since we've already established my ability 22 with math and birth dates, can someone tell me how old23 the child was here? Birth date on Jordan was in '98,24 September/October? Okay, September '97 to August25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 63 of 2391518 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-48882000, so two years and -- two and six-twelfth years,1 okay. Now I'm ready.2 Q Okay. You did not discuss this test result 3 in your testimony yesterday, is that right?4 A Yes, and the reason I did not is that the 5 mercury levels in blood are so transient.6 Q The next test that we were able to locate in 7 the records is from May 1, 2000, and this is Jordan8 King Exhibit 1 at 45, and this is a post-provocation9 challenge, and you did discuss this result yesterday,10 and you noted that his results were high, is that11 right?12 A That's correct. And tell me the date on 13 this, did you say May 2000?14 Q May 1, 2000. 15 A Okay. 16 Q Did Jordan have a pre-provocation baseline 17 test done the previous day?18 A I don't recall. 19 Q And this was a test that was ordered by Dr. 20 Green, is that right?21 A That's correct. 22 Q And Dr. Green is a member of the Defeat 23 Autism Now, he's a DAN doctor?24 A Yeah, we actually don't use the term \"DAN 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 64 of 2391519 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888doctor\" anymore for reasons that I articulated1 yesterday, but he is a member of our consortium, our2 group.3 Q Okay. Doesn't the consensus statement say 4 that for a post-provocation test a baseline should be5 done?6 A And I suspect that what happened here is 7 that a clinical decision was made in the context of8 clinical management not to continue to have the family9 have such high expenses. One of the great10 difficulties we have in trying to utilize these labs11 is that they frequently are out-of-pocket expenses for12 the family, and there are many, many times when we13 would prefer to have more laboratory information, but14 if the parent is buying supplements to restore the15 nutrition of their child, and buying medications, and16 having frequent doctor visits, in many states autism17 is carved out as a psychiatric diagnosis.18 So that if you go to a doctor and you're 19 autistic, you have much difficulty getting20 reimbursement for seeing the doctor, even if you went21 in because of, you know, diarrhea or, you know,22 whatever the case. If it's not coded very carefully,23 it's a huge financial burden on the family.24 So knowing John the way that I do, I would 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 65 of 2391520 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888guess that he was trying to spare the family more1 expense.2 Q And my question was actually whether the 3 DAN! consensus statement --4 A I'm sorry. 5 Q -- recommends that a baseline be done before 6 a post-provocation test.7 A We do recommend that. 8 Q And doesn't the fact that a baseline test 9 was not done make the post-provocation results less10 reliable?11 A It is suggested that a baseline urine sample 12 be collected, followed by a provoked sample. This13 allows one to directly compare. Comparing with an14 unprovoked urine also helps if the person has abnormal15 creatine levels, and creatine is often found to be16 marginal, and low creatine can skew the urine analyte17 results to high levels.18 So, I guess my question would be were there 19 other times that Dr. Green had done a pre- and post-20 provocation such that he already had a pattern and was21 using this as more of a marker for his follow up to22 the therapies he was providing in order to see if he23 was getting effective excretion. That is how I would24 interpret that.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 66 of 2391521 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q You've reviewed Dr. Green's records, is that 1 correct?2 A I have. 3 Q Did you see any such test in his records? 4 A My memory is that he did do a pre- 5 provocation and a post-provocation specimen. I think6 we presented that yesterday as an example of how this7 process works, but I'll rely on Scott to help sort8 that out.9 Q But at this point in time for this 10 particular test had he up to this time performed a11 baseline sample test?12 A I am not able to answer that without 13 referring to the records. Perhaps we can find that14 during the break and I can address it later?15 Q Sure. Okay, let's look at the next test and 16 this is Jordan King Exhibit 1 at page 36, and this was17 a provoked fecal test done on May 2, 2000, and I18 believe this is one that you did discuss yesterday, is19 that right?20 A Yes. 21 Q Are there other values that are elevated on 22 this test besides mercury?23 A Yes. 24 Q And what are they? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 67 of 2391522 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Arsenic and lead and thallium and tungsten. 1 Q Are those values at all significant to your 2 opinions?3 A When we see other elements -- well, first of 4 all, I don't usually use fecal testing in my personal5 practice, so I am talking a little bit out of scope of6 my clinical experience, and so I would like to do that7 with that caveat.8 I'm sorry. I think I may have said lead was 9 elevated, and it looks like it's actually nickel.10 We look for potential environmental sources 11 when we see things that are in the elevated range, and12 I rely, since I'm not a toxicologist, with the report13 that comes with the tests, to go through an14 environmental history with the family and say, do you15 have your child exposed to these potential sources.16 We have not as yet identified, to my 17 knowledge, thallium or tungsten or nickel as areas of18 potential concern, and I think the point here is that19 our feces are one of the ways that we get rid of20 environmental exposures, and so it's not unusual to me21 that we would find other elements in the stool.22 Q Is it normal for children to be excreting 23 elevated levels of arsenic, nickel, thallium and24 tungsten?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 2391523 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Is it normal? I imagine that children 1 weren't doing that as much before they were exposed to2 grocery store chicken that had arsenic in it, or some3 of the other environmental changes that have occurred4 with industrialization. It probably is very common in5 normal children. I would say it is not an ideal state6 that we were necessarily meant to live in.7 Q Did you see anything in Jordan King's 8 medical records that suggested to you any exposures9 that might explain elevated arsenic, nickel, thallium10 or tungsten?11 A I can't recall now. In looking through 12 John's records, I think that he personally would have13 probably asked about arsenic exposures, but I don't14 recall if that was recorded.15 Q Okay, let's move to the next test which is 16 Jordan King Exhibit 12 at 37, and this was a random17 urine test taken on May 23, 2000, is that right?18 A I can't see the date but I'll be glad to 19 take your word for it.20 Q We'll try to blow it up for you. 21 A Yes. Yeah, no, it's fine. I take your word 22 for it.23 Q Okay. And this was not a test that you 24 discussed yesterday, is that correct?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 69 of 2391524 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A That's correct. 1 Q Is there a reason that you didn't discuss 2 this test?3 A I was told that we were trying to present a 4 tight case and that we would have limited number of5 slides, so I didn't choose to include it because it6 says no reference range was established. It didn't7 seem that it would be informative.8 Q But the test results were essentially 9 normal, is that correct?10 A Yes, it is listed in the normal column. 11 Q And the next test that we can look at is 12 Jordan King Exhibit 1, page 43, and this is a provoked13 fecal test done on June 19, 2000, is that right?14 A Yes. 15 Q Okay. And you did not discuss this test 16 result yesterday, is that right?17 A I actually don't recall. We initially had a 18 larger number of these tests and we ended up not19 showing all of them because, as you sat through it,20 some of my testimony was repetitive, so I honestly21 don't recall.22 Q So this may have been one that you decided 23 just wasn't important enough to include in the scaled24 down presentation, is that right?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 70 of 2391525 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Perhaps. Yes. 1 Q Okay, let's look at the next test that we 2 found in the records, and this is at Jordan King3 Exhibit 1, page 42, and this is another provoked fecal4 test. It's done on September 11, 2000, is that right?5 A Yes. 6 Q Okay. And where the previous test was 7 elevated, this test is no longer elevated, is that8 right, for mercury?9 A That's correct. 10 Q Okay. And this was again a test that you 11 didn't discuss in your presentation yesterday?12 A And so I'm happy to do it now. There are a 13 number of reasons that that could be the case. One14 possibility would be that at that particular point in15 time whatever Dr. Green had done was effective in16 decreasing the child's mercury burden.17 Another possibility is that this was 18 provoked, correct, Mr. Johnson?19 Q Yes, it was. 20 A Another possibility was that the agent he 21 chose at that particular time wasn't being effective. 22 So, our pattern tends to be one where at times there23 is excretion, other times there is not. I wish I24 could say that it correlated well with our rational25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 71 of 2391526 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888approach to the children, but in my experience that's1 actually not even necessarily the case because2 sometimes some combination of things that we are doing3 seems to work better and we can't identify why.4 One of the difficulties of us having 5 scientific studies in our practice is is that we're6 trying to work on getting the kids better, so we're7 not as good at isolating the various factors.8 Q All right, let's look at the next test. 9 This one, I believe, is one that you discussed10 yesterday.11 A Correct. 12 Q And this is a provoked urine test on 13 December 19, 2000, and the cite is Jordan King Exhibit14 1 at page 35?15 A That's correct. 16 Q Okay. And this was a post-provocation test, 17 is that right?18 A Yes. 19 Q And again was any baseline performed prior 20 to this test?21 A I'm not certain, but since you're asking the 22 question I'm thinking maybe it was not.23 Q And on this test Jordan's tin level was 24 elevated, is that right?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 72 of 2391527 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A That's correct. 1 Q Does the elevated tin level concern you at 2 all?3 A When we see elevated tin, we look for 4 environmental exposures like whether they are getting5 it from juice boxes or toothpastes. I don't know much6 about tin toxicology, and I'm not aware that tin in7 itself has been demonstrated to be a huge problem in8 children, but just from a standpoint of trying to9 optimize the environment, that is usually the only10 intervention I do in my practice. Perhaps that will11 ultimately be proven correct, or I could be wrong.12 Q Do you know how much toothpaste it would 13 take to reach tin levels at this level?14 A I really don't. I'm sorry. 15 Q And any idea how many juice boxes a child 16 would need to consume to get this much tin?17 A Absolutely no idea. 18 Q Okay. Let's look at the next test, which is 19 at Jordan King Exhibit 7, page 36, and this is a hair20 test, correct?21 A It is. 22 Q Okay. And as you testified earlier, you 23 don't find hair tests particularly reliable, is that24 right?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 73 of 2391528 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A At the older ages, that is correct. 1 Q All right, the next test that we found was 2 at Jordan King Exhibit 9, page 35, and this was from a3 different lab. The prior lab was Doctor's Data, I4 believe, and this is Great Smokies.5 A Yes. 6 Q And this is another hair test, is that 7 right?8 A It appears to be so, yes. 9 Q Okay. So again the reason that you didn't 10 discuss it yesterday was because you don't find the11 hair test to be reliable?12 A That's correct. 13 Q Okay. Let's look at the next test, which is 14 at Jordan King Exhibit 1, page 55.15 A Okay. 16 Q And I believe this is one that you discussed 17 yesterday.18 A I did. 19 Q Okay. And this is a provoked urine test 20 from Doctor's Data, is that right?21 A Yes. 22 Q And the date on this is February 12, 2003, 23 correct?24 A Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 74 of 2391529 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q I believe in relation to this test you noted 1 that seven times -- that the mercury was at seven2 times the top of the reference range. Is that right?3 A That's right, and I hope I did the math 4 right, yes.5 Q Okay. And again no baseline was conducted 6 before this test, is that correct?7 A That's correct. 8 Q And here the amount of tin excreted was 20 9 times the top of the reference range, is that right?10 A Yeah. 11 Q Okay. But do you have any concerns about 12 that tin level?13 A Well, as I just testified, I'm not aware of 14 biological mechanisms about tin that concern me at15 this point in time. They may be there and I could be16 overlooking an area where I should be intervening with17 the kids, but I have not -- other than trying to18 control the environment, I have not been addressing19 tin in our patients.20 Q Okay. The next test is at Jordan King, 21 Exhibit 17, page 9. This is one from July 28, 2003,22 is that right? We just lost it. There we go.23 A Yes, it appears to be so. 24 Q Okay. And this was actually a pre- 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 75 of 2391530 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888provocation urine test, is that right?1 A On the left pre, and on the right post. 2 Q Okay. So we've got the post-provocation 3 urine test on the right, is that correct, and that was4 from the next day?5 A That's correct. 6 Q Okay. The pre-provocation test, mercury was 7 in the reference range, is that right?8 A That's correct. 9 Q And in the post-provocation test, the 10 mercury levels were actually below the detection11 limit, aren't they?12 A That's correct. 13 Q So they were lower after provocation? 14 A Yes. 15 THE WITNESS: And if I could ask the Special 16 Masters, could I go off the record for a moment to17 discuss this?18 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: I'm not sure why 19 we would want to discuss something off the record. 20 Let me first, before we get to that, you've got two21 exhibits on two pages of the exhibit on the screen.22 MR. JOHNSON: That's correct. 23 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Is that page 9, 24 the pre-test, and page 16, the post-test?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 76 of 2391531 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888MR. JOHNSON: Yes. 1 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Can you tell us, 2 Doctor, what you're thinking, why you want to go off3 the record? I guess I don't understand.4 THE WITNESS: Because I have some concerns 5 about the reliability of this test, and since I am6 concerned about on the web and in an official document7 being perceived as saying something potentially8 uncomplimentary about a business, I am concerned about9 the legal consequences of me doing so for my10 organization.11 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Well, I appreciate 12 that concern. On the other hand, we have got evidence13 in an important court case here, and the government14 may be relying upon this evidence --15 THE WITNESS: Okay. 16 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: -- to disprove 17 your theory.18 THE WITNESS: Okay. 19 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: I think we can't 20 rely on any evidence if we were to go off the record21 and you were to talk to us.22 THE WITNESS: Okay. 23 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: I couldn't rely on 24 that anyway. It wouldn't do you any good. So if you25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 77 of 2391532 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888think that this test thing is unreliable --1 THE WITNESS: I didn't say that. 2 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: -- I think you 3 should tell us on the record.4 THE WITNESS: Okay. In that case, it is my 5 best medical judgment that this particular laboratory6 testing is unreliable.7 BY MR. JOHNSON: 8 Q Does that include all testing from this 9 laboratory?10 A No. I would not say all testing from this 11 laboratory.12 Q Which tests from this laboratory would you 13 find reliable?14 A I'm not sure at this point in time. We are 15 currently taking a split sample reliability approach16 to replication of these results. So until I have that17 data, I really cannot answer the question.18 Q So Great Smokies is one of the labs that you 19 have included in the research project that is ongoing20 in your practice? Is that what I'm hearing you to21 say?22 A That's correct. 23 Q And at this time, based on the lack of 24 results that you've got at this point, you wouldn't be25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 78 of 2391533 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888comfortable relying on any testing from Great Smokies,1 is that right?2 A Not in a matter of this much importance, 3 that's correct.4 Q Thank you. So that was all of the test 5 results that we were able to find for Jordan King, and6 it appears that out of all of the tests you cited four7 that were supportive of your opinion, is that correct?8 A Correct. 9 Q Okay, let's talk about William Mead's 10 mercury testing.11 THE WITNESS: Could I ask the Special 12 Masters if this might be an appropriate time to take a13 break since we're moving from one child to another?14 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: It is about 15 20 of roughly, 18 minutes before 11. It's a little16 earlier but because you're the one who is going to be17 doing the chatting, we are happy to go ahead now if18 that makes sense, and I guess we will give ourselves19 until 11:00.20 THE WITNESS: Thank you so much. 21 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Okay, we are 22 in recess.23 (Whereupon, a short recess was taken.) 24 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: We are back 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 79 of 2391534 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888on the record. Please be seated.1 There have been some comments and 2 observations about the warmth of the courtroom. I3 personally am enjoying it, but I understand --4 (Laughter.) 5 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: -- Special 6 Master Hastings has demonstrated that we will invite7 counsel to remove your jackets if you are in danger of8 heat exhaustion, with that invitation and those others9 who are here.10 I also understand that Mr. Mead is leaving 11 this morning at 11:30, and I want to take the12 opportunity, as has been said a number of times during13 this proceeding, to thank you for your participation,14 for sharing your experience with us. I understand15 that Ms. Shirley will be here with us through the day,16 but we do want to thank you again for permitting your17 son's case to go forward in such a public way.18 MR. MEAD: Thank you. 19 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: With those 20 preliminary matters, we will resume where we were21 which I believe is the cross, and with particular22 focus on William Mead.23 MR. JOHNSON: That's correct, Special 24 Master.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 80 of 2391535 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Thank you. 1 BY MR. JOHNSON: 2 Q Dr. Mumper, we'll start with the first test 3 that we were able to locate in the medical records for4 William Mead, and this is William Mead Exhibit 5 at5 page 5, and this is a blood test, correct?6 A That is correct. 7 Q Okay. And this test is out of the reference 8 range for mercury, is that right?9 A That is correct. 10 Q Okay. And I believe this was the test that 11 you referenced yesterday during your testimony, is12 that right?13 A That is correct. 14 Q Now, this test was taken on January 8, 2001, 15 is that right?16 A Right. 17 Q And William's last vaccination containing 18 thimerosal was on April 12, 2000, which was19 approximately eight months earlier, is that right?20 A Right. 21 Q Since you've testified that mercury or that 22 ethyl mercury from thimerosal only stays in the blood23 for a matter of weeks, is it your position that this24 test reflected a more recent mercury exposure?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 81 of 2391536 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A That would be my concern, and that was one 1 of the reasons that I included in my reports the2 concern about ongoing environmental toxicities. It is3 known that in the Pacific Northwest there are concerns4 about environmental mercury exposures, so it leaves5 the door open for environmental exposures.6 Q And what specific environmental exposures 7 are you referring to? From what source?8 A Coal-burning power plants would be one 9 potential source; being located next to a mercury mine10 would be another potential source.11 Q Okay. And those would not be ethyl mercury, 12 is that right?13 A Right. 14 Q Okay, so -- 15 A I think that -- at least I intended to 16 testify that when these tests say \"mercury\" they are17 not species specific.18 Q Okay. And I guess I want to make clear that 19 your opinion in this case is that is it the ethyl20 mercury that's causing the problem or is it the21 inorganic mercury that is causing the problem?22 A My concern is the inorganic mercury that is 23 in the brain and in other tissues of the body.24 Q Okay. So this test being eight months after 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 82 of 2391537 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the most recent thimerosal-containing vaccine in your1 opinion would not be a reliable measure of mercury2 from the vaccination. Is that a fair statement?3 A Yeah. To the best of my knowledge, I think 4 that is probably true.5 Q Let's look at the next test, which is 6 William Mead Exhibit 5, page 3, and this is a post-7 provocation urine test from January 22, 2001, is that8 right?9 A Yes. 10 Q And this indicates that mercury was out of 11 the reference range, correct?12 A That's correct. 13 Q Okay. Was there a baseline test performed 14 prior to this post-provocation testing?15 A I don't recall. 16 Q In the medical records, it indicates that 17 William's parents referred to this test and said that18 William's test demonstrated extremely high amount of19 mercury in his system for which he will require20 chelation.21 My question is, would you in your practice 22 rely on a single post-provocation urine test where no23 baseline was performed to determine that a child24 required chelation?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 83 of 2391538 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A I am not as experienced in chelation as John 1 Green is, and I actually tend to do many more things2 first than more experienced environmental doctors. So,3 I probably would not have even gone to chelation quite4 that early in the course of William's care. But I5 would yield to Dr. Green's greater level of6 experience.7 Q Does the fact that William excreted a large 8 amount of mercury after his first post-provocation9 test indicate that he did not have any problems10 excreting mercury?11 A Did the fact that he excreted it with 12 provocation indicate that he does not have problems13 excreting it, is that the correct --14 Q On the first provocation, the very first 15 time that he had a post-provocation test done he16 excreted a large amount of mercury according to the17 records that we have, is that correct?18 A That's correct. 19 Q Does the fact that after the very first test 20 he excreted a large amount of mercury, does that21 indicate that he did not have problems excreting22 mercury?23 A That tells me that with an agent designed to 24 mobilize mercury he was able to excrete it. To my25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 84 of 2391539 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888knowledge, that doesn't really inform us about his own1 innate capabilities.2 Q In Dr. Green's records, he makes a 3 statement, and this is at William Mead Exhibit 5, page4 89, and Dr. Green states that, \"William excreted no5 mercury with challenge while he clearly has a mercury6 load to deal with.\"7 Is that consistent with the post-provocation 8 test result?9 A Okay. 10 Q And this is from a record dated -- 11 A February 12th. 12 Q Right. And the test that was done was 13 January 22, 2001.14 A Okay, and the January '01 was the one that 15 did show a lot of mercury on provocation, the one we16 just discussed, is that correct?17 Q Yes. 18 A Okay. You know, I'm not sure what he means 19 by that. Could you flip the other lab back up for20 just a second?21 Oh, I'm sorry. Now I understand -- well, I 22 don't exactly understand what he meant, but one thing23 that makes this difficult to interpret as flashed is24 that John has made a note that this is a spot urine25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 85 of 2391540 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888and not a 24-hour urine, and I apologize for not1 seeing this a moment ago.2 So, John is saying that because that 3 particular specimen, and you can imagine how difficult4 it is to get urine from these kids, was not obtained5 in a 24-hour fashion. I think he's saying that he6 can't rely on it, sorry, as showing the kind of7 excretion that they were saying, because they8 corrected it for creatinine and volume, and I9 apologize to the Court because I had talked about the10 issue that when you have the creatinine out of the11 normal range, the markers are done in order to12 compensate for your creatinine.13 So, if you are compensating for it, assuming 14 it's a 24-hour urine, and it's indeed a spot urine,15 you can't apply those same standards.16 Q So would spot urine samples generally not be 17 reliable for showing mercury levels?18 A They're limited. You know, we try to get as 19 long a sample as we can, but understandably we are20 limited by what the parents are able to collect. Yes,21 they are limited utility.22 Q Thank you. Let's look at the next test 23 which is William Mead Exhibit 5, page 34, and is this24 a blood test?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 86 of 2391541 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A This is a -- erythrocyte means red blood 1 cell, so this is a test of the blood done in June '01.2 Q All right. And was this a test result that 3 you discussed yesterday?4 A I don't recall. Can you tell me if I did? 5 Q I believe it was. 6 A Okay, thanks. 7 Q And I was wondering if you could tell me 8 what you view as the significance of this result.9 A Actually, you've just covered up the part 10 that I viewed as significant. I believe that I was11 using this to talk about the low essential elements12 and how we use these blood tests to monitor the safety13 of chelation so that we can use them for replenishing14 supplements.15 I also may have pointed out the low zinc and 16 the low selenium which we pay particular attention to17 when we're replenishing, and I may have made a comment18 that since the mercury was not in the very elevated19 range, that I would not see evidence of ongoing high20 mercury exposures.21 Q Now, explain for me why in this test you 22 don't find the mercury results particularly23 significant whereas for the first test we looked at,24 the January 8, '01, test, you did find the mercury25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 87 of 2391542 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888level that was elevated there significant?1 A Can you put them side by side? They were 2 both red blood cells done by the same laboratory, is3 that correct?4 Q I believe so. That's Exhibit 5 at 5. And I 5 asked a vague question and let me try to be a little6 bit more specific.7 A Right. 8 Q You found the mercury levels when they are 9 elevated significant, but you didn't really find the10 ones where they were normal as significant, and I'm11 wondering how those relate to your opinion in this12 case that thimerosal and vaccines cause William Mead13 to have autism.14 A Okay, now I understand. 15 When we red blood cell essential elements 16 test that also includes the toxic elements at the17 bottom, we are primarily using it for the top half of18 the test, the part that looks at the essential19 elements. The only thing that the toxic elements part20 at the bottom tells me is whether there is concern21 that there is a potential ongoing exposure.22 Red blood cells typically only live about 23 120 days, and obviously we don't know for any24 particular cell, you know, what day of their life we25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 88 of 2391543 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888were measuring them on here, so we use a rough1 estimate. When we look at the toxic part of the red2 blood cell essential elements, we use a rough estimate3 that it's telling us something about potential4 exposures within the previous or surrounding three-5 month period max.6 We specifically are not using the red blood 7 cell test to try to estimate body burden, and this8 ties to the fact that we believe that blood tests that9 look at mercury are only valuable for acute10 toxicities, which is not what we're alleging here. 11 We're not alleging acute toxicity from mercury12 poisoning, and here, even though the level initially13 was at the 97th percentile, we're not alleging that14 that is evidence of this child having a body burden of15 mercury that's above the 99th percentile. We're only16 using the bottom part of this test to look at the17 possibility of ongoing exposures.18 Q And you during that explanation used the 19 term \"we\" a number of times, and again is \"we\"20 referring to your colleagues at the Autism Research21 Institute?22 A Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry. 23 Q Let's look at the next test, which is 24 William Mead Exhibit 15, page 98, and this was after25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 89 of 2391544 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888William had been on and off chelation for almost a1 year at this point, and this is an unprovoked fecal2 metals test, correct?3 A Actually, would you mind blowing up the 4 bottom? Yes, that's correct.5 Q And here mercury was in the reference range, 6 correct?7 A That is correct. 8 Q And the date of this was December 26, 2001? 9 A Yeah. I believe you. 10 Q Okay. I don't believe you discussed this 11 test result yesterday, and I was wondering if it was12 at all significant to your opinions.13 A I tried to make the point that there is a 14 wide ebbing and flowing of various excretions of15 mercury both in the stool and in the urine, and that16 we expect to see that and that we expect to see it17 fluctuate. So the fact that this was in the normal18 range at this point in time does not deter me from my19 overlying opinion, no.20 Q Okay. The next test is William Mead Exhibit 21 12, page 8, and this was, I believe, a hair test on22 May 8, 2002, is that correct?23 A That's correct. 24 Q Okay. And just for the record, as you've 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 90 of 2391545 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888testified earlier, you don't find hair tests1 particularly reliable, is that right?2 A That's correct. Again, the best technology 3 available back in the early 2000s, but we know now not4 as valuable as we would like.5 Q Right. And just to be clear, I think you 6 said that it's not reliable based on the age; that for7 infants it might be reliable but not for older8 children, is that right?9 A Exactly. 10 Q The next test that we found in the records 11 was at William Mead Exhibit 15, page 97.12 A Yes. 13 Q And I believe this is a test that you 14 discussed yesterday.15 A Yes. 16 Q This is an unprovoked urine test on July 10, 17 2002, is that correct?18 A Correct. 19 Q And here the mercury was within the 20 reference range, is that right?21 A That's correct. 22 Q Okay. Was a baseline test performed prior 23 to this test? Do you know?24 A I'm sorry. Didn't we decide this one is 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 91 of 2391546 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888non-provoked, so wouldn't that be the baseline?1 Q Absolutely. Thank you for correcting me. 2 A Okay. 3 Q So this was the unprovoked urine test, and 4 then was there a provoked test performed after this? 5 Do you know?6 A I don't recall. 7 Q Okay. Because the next test that we were 8 able to find in the records was on August 14, 2002,9 and this is at William Mead Exhibit 15, pages 87 to10 88.11 A Yes. 12 Q And this is a provoked urine test, is that 13 right?14 A Actually, I'm having trouble finding where 15 it says -- yeah, information regarding pre- or post-16 provocation was not provided. I thought that I had17 discussed that.18 Q You did. 19 A Oh, okay. 20 Q So am I correct that the test, the 21 unprovoked test on 7-10-2002, July 10th of 2002,22 that's not a normal -- the fact that the post-23 provocation test was done over a month later, that's24 not the normal protocol, is that correct?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 92 of 2391547 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Okay. First of all, do we know that this 1 was provoked or unprovoked because I think I can't2 know that.3 Q Okay. So you don't know one way or the 4 other?5 A Right. 6 Q Okay. 7 A Right. 8 Q But assuming that it were a provoked test, 9 the fact that an unprovoked test was performed a month10 prior, that is not consistent with the recommendation11 in the consensus statement, is that right?12 A Well, let me clarify that the recommendation 13 in the consensus statement, as I recall, says it is14 suggested, and the issue at that point in time, and I15 can't remember when the norms were tightened up, but16 the concern at that point in time had to do with this17 issue of normalizing for creatinine.18 So if I could call your attention to the 19 very top of the chart, this one is comparing it as a20 ratio to grams of creatinine. So whereas when we21 wrote the consensus statement in like '99 or 2000, we22 wanted to make sure that that happened.23 I think that the labs that we rely on had 24 since -- well, I shouldn't say that because I don't25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 93 of 2391548 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888know when they started doing that, but my point is1 that we were trying to deal with the creatinine issue. 2 This seems to deal with the creatinine issue.3 Q Ma'am, when you say \"this seems to deal with 4 the creatinine issue\" --5 A Doing the test such that it's reported out 6 as in relationship to the creatinine as opposed to,7 for example, if I had a urine test and the lab8 reported back to me that the mercury level was, you9 know, 860, it would mean nothing to me until I knew10 what units of measurement they were talking about, and11 what it was in relation to creatinine. They do that12 here.13 Q Okay. Are there any other metals out of the 14 reference range on this test?15 A Cadmium, cesium, chromium, copper, 16 tetalinium, lithium, manganese, may have been17 related to supplementation, maliptium, molybdenum, and18 possibly nickel, and can you scroll back up to show19 the name of the laboratory? Yes.20 So based on what I said earlier, you 21 understand that we are doing ongoing reliability22 testing.23 Q So this test, William Mead Exhibit 15, pages 24 87 and 88, at this time it's not a test that you might25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 94 of 2391549 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888rely on, is that correct?1 A That would be fair. 2 Q The next test that we found was at William 3 Mead Exhibit 15, page 77, and this is a November 7,4 2002, provoked urine test, is that correct?5 A Yes. 6 Can you tell me if this is one that I showed 7 yesterday or not?8 Q I don't believe that you did discuss this 9 one yesterday.10 A Okay. 11 Q Was a baseline test performed prior to this 12 one?13 A I don't know but I think that the reason 14 that I may not have included that is because I didn't15 think that it would be informative based on the16 reasons I have already stated.17 Q And remind me what those reasons are again. 18 A That I find that there are other 19 laboratories that seem to have more specialized20 expertise in the toxicology area.21 Q Okay, so it's the lab and not the test? 22 A Right. 23 Q The next one that we found was from 24 September 8, 2003, and this is William Mead Exhibit 1525Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 95 of 2391550 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888at 67. This is not in the same lab, correct?1 A Yeah. And Doctor's Data, at least based on 2 my evaluation, seems to have a very good set of3 toxicologists on board, so at least to the extent that4 I as a general pediatrician can judge the competence5 of the toxicologists, Dr. Quig has been able to answer6 every question I've ever asked him about toxicology. 7 So I have relatively more faith in this lab's8 expertise.9 Q This test, I believe, was one that you did 10 not discuss during your presentation yesterday. Is11 there a reason why you did not find it significant?12 A I think that it was probably that it was yet 13 another urine toxic metals from the same lab that14 shows an elevated mercury, and I thought that we had15 sort of established that as a pattern.16 Q And do you know whether a baseline test was 17 performed prior to this test?18 A No. Since you have this up here though, I 19 will say that one of our concerns about thimerosal-20 containing vaccines has to do with the co-existence of21 aluminum which we regard as a potential synergistic22 toxicity. So, one of the things that I do when I see23 a high aluminum, again it's just an environmental24 measure, is to talk to the parents about whether they25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 96 of 2391551 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888use aluminum-containing cookware, whether the child is1 taking a lot of aluminum-containing antacids, or2 whether they are using a lot of aluminum foil.3 Q And when you say \"we\", I believe that there 4 is a synergistic relationship between aluminum and5 mercury, who are you referring to?6 A I'm talking about those of us that work with 7 ARI and Defeat Autism Now.8 Q Okay. And has ARI done any studies to 9 determine whether there is in fact such a synergistic10 relationship?11 A I'm not sure if we had, but I would be 12 surprised if we used our limited resources to do that13 because that is something that's been very well14 documented in numerous papers throughout the15 toxicology literature. So I think we would regard16 that as a question that's already been addressed17 scientifically.18 Q The next test that we were able to find was 19 at William Mead Exhibit 15, page 120.20 A Yes. 21 Q And this is a post-provocation urine test 22 from February 10, 2004, correct?23 A Yes. 24 Q And I believe this is another one that you 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 97 of 2391552 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888discussed during your testimony yesterday, is that1 correct?2 A Yes. 3 Q And do you know whether a baseline test was 4 done prior to this testing?5 A I don't recall, but again, because the 6 results are being reported by a lab that I trust in a7 way that reports the results in ratio to creatinine,8 it essentially obviates the concern that we expressed9 in the paper that we wrote back in '99.10 Q Is there no other reason to perform a 11 baseline test other than to deal with the creatinine12 issue?13 A You know, actually, I don't know the answer 14 to that not being a toxicologist.15 Q The next test that we found was, I believe, 16 another one that you discussed. This is William Mead17 Exhibit 15 at page 118.18 A Yes. 19 Q And this is a test dated December 6, 2004, 20 is that right?21 A Yes. 22 Q Okay. And is this a post-provocation test? 23 A It appears to be so. 24 Q Okay. And just if you know, was a baseline 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 98 of 2391553 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888test performed prior to this test?1 A I do not know. 2 Q And the next test that we were able to find 3 was at William Mead Exhibit 15, page 116, and this is4 a November 12, 2005, test, is that correct?5 A Yes. 6 Q And here lead and mercury were high, is that 7 correct?8 A That's correct. 9 Q Okay. Is this a post-provocation test? 10 A Yes, it is. 11 Q And to your knowledge, was any baseline 12 performed prior to this test?13 A I do not know. Again, I would be surprised 14 if John would continually do that because each of the15 tests would have been out-of-pocket costs for the16 family, and I don't understand why he would feel the17 need to do it repetitively since his results were18 being reported out normed to creatinine.19 Q Would the test be more reliable if a 20 baseline had been done?21 A Would the test be more reliable? You would 22 expect the baseline to either show that the child was23 not excreting or may be excreting. To my knowledge,24 the ones that we have seen have shown benefit with a25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 99 of 2391554 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888provocation challenge.1 So, I actually don't think that for the 2 purposes Dr. Green was using this test it would have3 enhanced the reliability significantly in the clinical4 situation to have to compare it to pre-provocation.5 Q If the pre-provocation test showed that the 6 child was excreting mercury, then that might indicate7 that there was no need for chelation, wouldn't it?8 A Perhaps. 9 Q The next test that we were able to find was 10 Petitioner's Exhibit 15 at 114, and again this was a11 post-provocation urine test, is that correct?12 A Yes. 13 Q And here mercury was in the reference range, 14 is that right?15 A That's correct. 16 Q Okay. And then the next test that we were 17 able to find, and this is actually the last one that18 we were able to find, was William Mead Exhibit 15 at19 page 112, and this is a test from February 22, 2007,20 and to your knowledge, was a baseline test performed21 prior to this test?22 A I do not recall. 23 Q What kind of chelation results would you 24 expect to see in a person without heavy metal25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 100 of 2391555 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888poisoning?1 A I don't know that I know the answer to that 2 question. Not being a toxicologist, I am concerned3 that we all do have body burdens of various4 substances. So one of the areas of research that5 perhaps would be informative would be to do such a6 study.7 Q And I believe you testified yesterday, and 8 alluded to again this morning, that there is really9 not a standard pattern that you can identify for these10 kinds of test results, is that correct?11 A That is correct. 12 Q And I think you testified yesterday that 13 sometimes you get lead when you administer DMPS, is14 that correct?15 A Occasionally, more typically you see more 16 lead with DMSA, but --17 Q Because DMSA is actually more associated 18 with excreting lead, isn't that correct?19 A Right. Right. 20 Q Okay. And DMPS is actually what you would 21 administer more specifically for mercury, is that22 right?23 A That's correct. 24 Q And sometimes you see tests where you've 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 101 of 2391556 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888administered DMPS, and you would expect to see more1 mercury, but you get more lead, is that right?2 A Right, and one of my questions about that 3 has to do with the other things we're doing for the4 child at the time. So I think I mentioned yesterday5 that I tend not to use chelation very much at all, but6 work more on the body's own mechanisms that are7 naturally intended to do that.8 So, I think the thing we have may have lost 9 sight of here is that at the time that Dr. Green was10 trying to use various chelating agents to the best of11 his ability, he was also doing the much more12 fundamentally important work in my mind, which was13 providing the co-factors for the body's methylation14 and transsulfuration biochemistry.15 By giving supplements, specifically magnesium, or pyridoxal biphosphate, or methyl17 cobalamin or folate, all of those things are working18 potentiating, to use the DOJ's favorite word,19 methylation biochemistry and sulfation.20 And so we can't possibly control for how 21 much of the body excreting lead or mercury at any22 given time is going to be a direct correlation of what23 agent we picked because there is so many other factors24 that are going on with the body, and John Green was25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 102 of 2391557 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888doing so many other fundamentally very important1 things in these children that I think it's very2 misleading to try to make too much from a pattern that3 fluctuates over time with different chelating agents4 when so much else was also being done to try to heal5 him, if that makes sense.6 Q And, Doctor, just for the record, potentiate 7 was your word. That's not the DOJ word.8 A No, it was a bad joke. Sorry. 9 Q Doctor, since there is no standard pattern 10 and we've seen with both William Mead and Jordan King11 that their results fluctuated, is there any pattern12 that you can imagine that you would interpret as13 supportive of mercury toxicity?14 A I have told that to parents on the basis of 15 their test results, and again I'm really hesitant to16 try to layout some quantifiable pattern because the17 science is still evolving, and I don't have it clearly18 established to be able to make a generalization.19 So, what I can say is that when I have taken 20 a thorough history, examined a child, looked at the21 symptoms, suspected that mercury or lead or other22 toxicities might be an issue, and then I get labs that23 come back and don't seem to support that hypothesis,24 then what I do is move on to other possibilities or25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 103 of 2391558 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888move that down lower on my list and move other things1 up higher on my differential diagnosis. So, it very2 much depends on the other labs that are involved.3 Q Doctor, as you know, there are approximately 4 5,000 of these cases in this program, and the evidence5 that's being introduced into this proceeding is going6 to be applied to those other cases.7 Are you saying that there is no pattern that 8 you can identify that you would not interpret as not9 being supportive of mercury toxicity?10 A No. I was saying that -- I thought you were 11 asking me to make a judgment based on patterns of12 excretion related to chelation. Was that correct?13 Q That is correct, and I'm wanting to know if 14 there is a pattern that you would find to be not15 supportive of mercury toxicity.16 A Patterns in which the children were able to 17 show that they had good oxidative stress markers at18 the time of thimerosal-containing vaccines,19 glutathione working well, methylation biochemistry20 working well, those kinds of things. I think there is21 very limited utility for me as a pediatrician to22 propose a toxicological benchmark for your upcoming23 decisions. So, I think that you will need to rely on24 the toxicologists to try to help identify that, and I25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 104 of 2391559 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888would have to take myself out of the running as being1 not the person to deal with that part of the case.2 Q But, Doctor, these are clinical tests, 3 aren't they?4 A Yes, and by very definition clinical means 5 that I'm using them in context with the history and6 the responses of the child.7 Q And so you would still leave it to the 8 toxicologists to testify as to the pattern that would9 be not supportive of mercury toxicity?10 A I thought that your question to me was what 11 pattern would I propose as a general pediatrician,12 based on my clinical experience, that the government13 and others should use to decide 5,000 cases, and that14 is what I'm saying I don't want to do on the stand in15 this kind of a hearing. I think that that requires16 much more input and thought.17 Q You do understand that these are test cases, 18 correct?19 A I do. 20 Q In fact, I believe you were the one who was 21 actually responsible for selecting the test cases, is22 that right?23 A That is correct. 24 Q Did you not have an understanding when you 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 105 of 2391560 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888were doing that that this evidence that was introduced1 into these test cases would be applied to the other2 5,000 cases in the program?3 A I did understand that. This is my first 4 time testifying. I honestly did not anticipate that I5 would be asked to propose the kind of pattern that6 you're asking me to on the stand. And if that's part7 of my responsibility, I would be -- I cannot do that8 on the spur of the moment.9 Q Okay. Doctor, a number of the tests that we 10 looked at and that you relied on were from the lab11 Doctor's Data, correct?12 A That's correct. 13 Q And that was the lab that you said that 14 based on your experience you had a particular amount15 of confidence in, is that right?16 A That's correct. 17 Q And do you send samples in from your own 18 practice to Doctor's Data?19 A I do. 20 Q How important is it to you that the labs 21 that you rely on us reliable scientific techniques to22 test samples?23 A It is important to me. 24 Q And when you consider the reliability of a 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 106 of 2391561 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888lab, how important is it to you that the lab uses1 consistent reference values when reporting lab2 results?3 A It doesn't matter to me if they use 4 consistently the same reference ranges as long as on5 any given test they are telling me what the normal6 reference ranges are. I think that there are7 indications over time when by virtue of a change in8 the technique in the lab the reference ranges might9 change. That happens with lab core all the time,10 well, not all the time, but you know, not unusually. 11 So what would be important to me would be that the12 reference ranges are defined.13 Q How important is it to you that a lab avoids 14 contamination of both samples and controls?15 A I would think that would be important. 16 Q And how important is it to you that a lab 17 uses sterile solutions such as saline?18 A Sterile saline. It would be important. 19 Q And how important is it to you that a lab 20 replaces the saline if it is known to be non-sterile?21 A That would be important. 22 Q And how important is it to you that a lab 23 uses uncontaminated assays?24 A That would be important. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 107 of 2391562 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And how important would it be to you that a 1 lab replaces unexpired reagents?2 A That would be important. 3 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: Is it unexpired? 4 THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sorry. I substituted 5 expired in my mind. Sorry.6 MR. JOHNSON: Sorry. I misspoke. 7 THE WITNESS: Thank you. 8 BY MR. JOHNSON: 9 Q If Doctor's Data has problems with all of 10 these areas and others, would you still trust their11 lab results?12 A I would want to know the details about that 13 and the timing. I have only really been evaluating14 them in the last several years on the basis of what I15 can judge as a clinician.16 Q And do you do any hair testing in your 17 practice? I know you said you don't rely on them, but18 do you send out hair samples?19 A No. The only time I send it out is if I had 20 parents coming in for intakes who had saved baby hair21 samples, and in that case I would send them based on22 the work that was initially done by Holmes and23 replicated at MIT. Other than that, I don't think24 I've ever sent a hair sample that didn't fit into that25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 108 of 2391563 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888category.1 Q And would you send the hair samples to 2 Doctor's Data?3 A You know, I honestly can't remember if the 4 hair samples we sent went to Doctor's Data or another5 lab. But I would have no reason that I know of now6 not to send it to Doctor's Data.7 Q Okay. I want to show you a report from the 8 New York State Department of Health, which inspected9 Doctor's Data Lab.10 A Okay. 11 Q This is a letter from -- 12 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Pardon me. 13 Are you planning to introduce this as a trial exhibit?14 MR. JOHNSON: Actually, yes, Special Master, 15 we will. We can go and do that now.16 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Okay, if we 17 could have copies, that would be great. And this18 would be Trial Exhibit 2, the first of which was the19 Dr. Kinsbourne matter.20 (The document referred to was 21 marked for identification as 22 Respondent's Trial Exhibit 23 No. 2.) 24 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Thank you. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 109 of 2391564 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888(Pause.) 1 BY MR. JOHNSON: 2 Q Have you had a chance to review the letter? 3 A I'm halfway through the last paragraph. 4 Q Take your time. 5 (Pause.) 6 A Okay, I think I have the gist of it. 7 Q Okay. Doctor, this letter is in response to 8 a request made by Doctor's Data to perform multi-hair9 analysis on patient specimens collected in New York10 State, and the Department of Health denied a similar11 request in 1986, and in this 1999 letter, it noted,12 \"The Center's 1986 decision was based primarily on13 concerns about external specimen contamination and14 lack of good reference values. These concerns15 persist.\"16 And then further down, \"Well defined 17 reference intervals are an essential component of18 properly validated procedures. Our attempt to19 ascertain the derivation of Doctor Data's reference20 intervals has been confounded by the inconsistency of21 reference intervals posted on the lab's webpage and22 those reported in publication reprints purportedly23 supporting the use of diagnostic hair analysis.\"24 Have you seen this letter before? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 110 of 2391565 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A No. 1 Q Does this letter change your opinion in any 2 way regarding the reliability of Doctor's Data lab3 results?4 A Well, actually, I'll point out a couple of 5 thoughts that I have.6 First, the concerns seem to be primarily 7 related to external specimen contamination, and to my8 recollection Doctor's Data does send out information9 about avoiding certain kinds of shampoos and external10 contamination, et cetera, et cetera, in the time11 period when I would have sent the baby hair, which is12 many years after this letter.13 Secondly, the concerns to my read seem to be 14 primarily with reference ranges where you would be15 dealing with an argument about what the upper ranges16 of normal are and not using it in a situation in which17 you were looking for lack of excretion.18 So, I had read some stuff in the literature 19 about hair analysis which led me to decide not to use20 it for looking for high levels. I don't know that21 this would impact using it on baby hair because with22 the baby hair study what you are looking for is that23 the child doesn't show mercury, and so the levels are24 very, very low.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 111 of 2391566 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888So, if anything, I think that these alleged 1 difficulties would actually cause me to have more what2 would be a false/positive in the sense of a false3 indication that my baby was able to excrete mercury as4 opposed to not being able to excrete mercury. So, I5 really don't see -- even though I'm distressed to see6 this -- how it impacts on the way that I would use my7 hair analyses.8 Q Doctor, we're now going to show you a 2005, 9 actually it's a 2006 report from the New York State10 Department of Health, and we'll go ahead and mark this11 as a trial exhibit as well.12 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: That would 13 be Respondent's Trial Exhibit 3.14 (The document referred to was 15 marked for identification as 16 Respondent's Trial Exhibit 17 No. 3.) 18 BY MR. JOHNSON: 19 Q I would like to draw your attention to a 20 particular finding in this report.21 MR. POWERS: Excuse me. Dr. Mumper, do you 22 have the paper copy?23 THE WITNESS: I do not, but if they -- or I 24 don't think I do, but if they blow it up for me. Did25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 112 of 2391567 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888you give it to me?

MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888don't know upon lab review what the standards are for1 corrective measures and those kinds of things. But2 this is very concerning, and I had not seen this3 before.4 Is this my copy to keep, by the way? 5 Q Sure, you can have that. 6 A Okay. Go ahead. 7 Q Okay. I would now like to talk a little bit 8 about some of the facts specific to William Mead's9 case, and some of the support that you provided in10 your report in particular about William Mead.11 The first thing I want to ask you is that 12 when you reviewed the record, and we'll start with13 William Mead's case, was there a certain profile that14 you were looking for to determine that the child's15 autism was caused by thimerosal from vaccines?16 A I've not yet identified such a profile other 17 than to say that with the understanding we have of the18 chronic inflammation I tend to think of it more in19 kids that I identify patterns in which they might not20 be able to handle a thimerosal-containing vaccine.21 Sometimes it's kids who seem to be sick at 22 the time that they get their shots or have chronic23 illnesses. Sometimes it's kids where the parents seem24 to report bad reactions to the shots. But I really25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 114 of 2391569 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888don't have a standard kind of clinical profile.1 Q Is there a test that you consider to be 2 conclusive evidence of thimerosal-related autism?3 A No. 4 Q Is there a key piece of evidence in William 5 Mead's case that you rely on for your opinion?6 A I think that the -- well, there are a number 7 of things that I relied on, and again because I'm a8 clinician and because I don't have a good marker, it's9 difficult for me to isolate a key piece. But the way10 that I thought of this case as I read it was that this11 is a child that I would expect not to have well12 operating oxidative stress and methylation markers on13 the inferential, indirect, incomplete and having14 improved over time since then. But given the evidence15 that John Green had when he was trying to manage this16 case, it seemed to construct a story of a child who17 would not be able to mobilize the mercury due to18 oxidative stress issues.19 And then when Dr. Green looked for mercury, 20 he found it, and when he started working on the21 child's medical problems the child's autism got22 better. So it would seem to me that we then have to23 include thimerosal in a list of potential24 environmental factors because if this was purely25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 115 of 2391570 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888genetically-related autism it's difficult for me to1 explain why it would switch on at 15 to 18 months, and2 then, you know, seemingly get better after3 interventions.4 I will be the first to acknowledge that not 5 being the treating physician it's hard for me to know6 which intervention might have really helped him the7 most. My suspicion is that since we deal with the8 whole child and take a systems approach, that it's a9 combination of what we do that gets the kids healthier10 and gets them better.11 So, I have to go back to for me I think the 12 key is the parents' story, the child's history,13 putting it together with the absence of physical exam14 findings that would be suggestive of other causes of15 autism, and then the biologic plausibility of damage16 from the injection of something that we know contains17 ethyl mercury which we know breaks down to inorganic18 mercury, which we know persists in the brain for as19 yet undetermined years or decades.20 And so as a clinician I have to go back to 21 that kind of careful synthesis as opposed to22 identifying one isolated factor.23 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Counsel, let 24 me just ask. Dr. Mumper, you did state that this was25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 116 of 2391571 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888a child that you would expect would not have good1 oxidative stress markers. Is this the type of child,2 as you indicated earlier in your patterns, based on3 William's ear infections, his series of ear infections4 and upper respiratory infection?5 THE WITNESS: That is correct. 6 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Okay. Thank 7 you.8 THE WITNESS: Thank you. 9 BY MR. JOHNSON: 10 Q What is your strongest evidence that William 11 Mead's autism was caused by thimerosal from vaccines?12 A Well, I apologize if I have misspoken, but I 13 think I always try to be very careful not to say that14 it was the cause, but to say things like it was a15 substantial contributing factor, or I thought that it16 exacerbated his problems, or I thought that it was in17 my best medical judgment contributing.18 So, my strongest piece of evidence would be 19 the demonstration that he excreted a body burden of a20 substance that is known to after injection into21 infants bypass the normal protective mechanisms of the22 gut, go across the blood-brain barrier, be broken down23 such that to me a very scary fraction persists as24 inorganic mercury, and that the best available25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 117 of 2391572 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888evidence of what we understand about the impact of1 thimerosal, not on direct neurotoxicity, direct2 killing or acute toxicity at all, but our best3 available evidence about how it affects things like4 calcium channel signaling and redox ratios and5 neuronal communication disruption of inhibitory6 neurotransmitters and exacerbation of excitatory7 neurotransmitters. I think that is my best available8 evidence.9 Q So the post-provocation testing is your 10 strongest evidence, is that correct? Is that what you11 just said? That's what it sounded to me what you just12 said.13 A No, no. 14 Q Okay. 15 A We're back to this bigger picture of 16 utilizing indirect evidence, i.e., post-provocation17 urines, the laboratory data that I showed yesterday18 about him having metabolic acidosis which applies19 association with oxidative stressers, the evidence20 that we have by history and exam of his difficulty21 utilizing nutrients, the clinical picture related to22 his reported failure to thrive, those things taken23 together point to a child where we know that he24 received a substance that, at least based on animal25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 118 of 2391573 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888models, converts to inorganic mercury in the brain,1 and we know from in vitro testing that thimerosal has2 adverse effects on the crucial enzymes in his3 methylation pathway on glutathione, also in the4 methylation pathway on calcium channel, signaling and5 on crucial neurotransmitters.6 So, I am only using the post-provoked urines 7 as one piece of the puzzle that helps develop this8 bigger picture. So, I guess my strongest piece of9 evidence I'll have to say is those things that I10 determine on the basis of reviewing a comprehensive11 record that I, to the best of my knowledge and12 understanding, believe put him in a situation of13 oxidative stress and poor redox status at a time that14 he received vaccines known to convert to inorganic15 mercury.16 Q If there were no evidence of oxidative 17 stress, would you be able to reach the same opinion in18 this case?19 A No, because we are acknowledging right up 20 front that the vast majority of children that did get21 these thimerosal-containing vaccines do well with22 them, and you know, I'm a pediatrician. I have given23 thousands of vaccines in my life.24 So, the problem is that we didn't have the 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 119 of 2391574 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888markers back in 2001 that are as good as they are now1 for oxidative stress. For example, you know, I would2 have loved to have seen an early on fasting3 glutathione in John Green's records, but you know, we4 didn't really have that then. I would have loved to5 have seen urinary neopterin and biopterin, but we6 didn't have that then.7 The methylation markers that Jill James has 8 done work on for three or four years still aren't9 commercially available. They would be wonderful to10 have but we don't have that then.11 So, I don't think that it's fair to penalize 12 the kids that were born at a time, or develop symptoms13 at a time when we couldn't sort all this out, and we14 couldn't have great lab markers. I think that we can15 be informed by what we've learned about other kids in16 the meantime where we have been able to do the17 measurements, and in my clinic about 80 percent of the18 regressive autism cases that I see, when I look for19 those methylation abnormality markers they have them,20 and so I use that clinical experience to extrapolate21 and I only do this because I don't have the markers22 available to me that I've seen the story over and over23 where the kids have multiple ear infections, they have24 chronic diarrhea, and when I send methylation by25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 120 of 2391575 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888chemistry markers on those kids it tends to come back1 abnormal.2 So, I just -- I feel very bad that we're 3 limited by what was known then in trying to make4 decisions about kids that were born when they were5 born, and are coming before us.6 Q Do you look for the biomarkers you were just 7 discussing in your non-autistic patients?8 A No, and we acknowledge that we have not yet 9 had good comparisons between normal kids and kids with10 autism. The labs that we use we hope are norming them11 accordingly based on normal populations. But one of12 the things we hope to do, and we've recently committed13 some of our very small resources into doing controls14 with the studies that we are doing.15 We are going to find out, I feel quite sure, 16 that there is going to be some overlap, and so that's17 when the whole picture and clinical judgment comes in. 18 There may well be normal children who have some19 abnormal markers, but it's a matter of how many things20 are wrong with any given child, and how well that21 child is able to compensate. So, we are trying to do22 those studies. We just do not have very much funding23 to do them.24 Q You state in your report in William Mead's 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 121 of 2391576 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888case that low zinc levels compromise the ability to1 excrete metals. What is your support for that2 statement?3 A I was taught by -- I can't recall who in a 4 toxicology lecture, it was one of the people that5 comes to the think tanks that zinc is one of the6 things that complexes with metallothionein in order to7 take mercury out of the body. My memory is that it's8 four molecules of zinc that's necessary to take one9 unit of mercury out, but I would not want to hang my10 hat on that number.11 Q So, your support for that statement was a 12 talk that was given by someone at -- is that an Autism13 Research Institute think tank?14 A Yes. 15 Q You would agree that low zinc levels can be 16 caused by diet. In fact, I think you testified about17 that, is that right?18 A Yes. 19 Q Could low zinc levels also be caused by 20 chronic infections?21 A Yes. 22 Q And William Mead in this case had persistent 23 bronchitis and other infections as a child, is that24 correct?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 122 of 2391577 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Right. 1 Q And could rapid growth also cause low zinc 2 levels?3 A Yes, I'm recognizing a number of these from 4 one of my slide presentations.5 Q You state in your report that low plasma 6 amino acids documented at Massachusetts General7 Hospital, and you may have actually discussed these or8 shown these test results yesterday.9 A Right. 10 Q You cite these as support for your opinion. 11 Can you explain the significance of those test12 results?13 A I'm going to go back to the paper because I 14 worded that very carefully.15 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Just for my 16 own reference and the record, this is page 5 of Dr.17 Mumper's expert opinion in the Mead matter.18 MR. JOHNSON: Thank you. 19 THE WITNESS: All I see that I said in that 20 report was that one of the things I listed as21 laboratory evidence of impairments was low plasma22 amino acids documented at Mass. General Lab. I had23 tried to be very careful when I discussed these24 yesterday to acknowledge that it did not show any kind25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 123 of 2391578 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888of classic pattern of in-born error of metabolism.1 In looking at the particular amino acids 2 there, I had gotten -- there is a biochemistry chart3 that I brought with me that I use when I'm trying to4 look at laboratory values, and it hangs in my clinic,5 and what I do is look at the pathways that are6 affected in those particular cases and see if can tie7 it into what we do know about autism pathology.8 So, in looking at these particular markers, 9 there were several of them that -- the concept here is10 that if you've got one thing, substance A, and you're11 trying to make substance C, but you need something to12 drive that reaction, that something might be an13 enzyme, a nutrient, a co-factor.14 So when you see low levels of a substance, 15 that makes me want to look back in the pathway and see16 what would have had to happen in order to take the17 precursor to the amino acid that was at a low level,18 and you know, one possibility is always diet, that the19 child is not eating protein enough to make the amino20 acid, but another possibility is that that co-factor,21 which in some cases is the conversion of ATP, or in22 some cases is a cellular mineral like zinc or23 magnesium, if I can discern any patterns.24 And here the cysteine and the cystathionine 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 124 of 2391579 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888are one of the things that is pretty consistently now1 implicated in the methylation biochemistry that we're2 concerned with, and I may be misrecalling the numbers3 but I thought that the cystathionine at the Mass.4 General Lab was actually reported as zero, although5 the reference ranges were a little confusing in that6 it was marked as less than three would be the7 reference range.8 So, in terms of looking at those labs in a 9 functional way as opposed to a way of looking for an10 in-born error of metabolism, those impairments I was11 able to tie directly to either the methylation12 biochemistry or the glutamate pathway. So that's why13 I tried to word this very carefully to say that it was14 a laboratory evidence of impairment, but not to try to15 overinterpret it anymore.16 BY MR. JOHNSON: 17 Q And these tests were not typically used to 18 determine mercury toxicity, is that right?19 A That is correct. 20 Q You also state in your report that William 21 had dramatically low digestive enzymes, is that right?22 A Yes. 23 Q Can you explain to me how that is related to 24 autism?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 125 of 2391580 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A It will be a little bit of a longer 1 explanation, but yes.2 One thing that we're concerned about is that 3 there is an enzyme called DPP-4, which stands for4 diopeptidyl peptidase 4. There was evidence, I think,5 as early as the early eighties, that certain toxins,6 such as organophosphates and mercury, inhibit the7 function of that enzyme, of DPP-4.8 DPP-4 is one of the things that the body 9 usually uses to breakdown gluten and casein. So one10 of our possible mechanisms by which children with11 autism can benefit from a gluten-free, casein-free12 diet, as both of these children did, is that they no13 longer have to process a food that they lack the14 enzymatic ability to digest.15 So, there is concern about mercury and other 16 toxins effect on that enzyme, but my understanding is17 that that's somewhat beyond the scope of what we're18 presenting primarily, but nonetheless we're dealing19 with the full child.20 The other way that that's related to autism 21 is that there are lots of neurotransmitters in the22 gut. I think something like 70 or 75 percent of23 serotonin is actually in the intestine, and serotonin24 is one of the more well known neurotransmitters25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 126 of 2391581 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888because it's what Prozac and Zoloft and all those1 things are working on the SSRIs.2 The test that was done at Mass. General, to 3 the best of my knowledge interpreting it, showed very,4 very low digestive enzymes prior to a secretin5 infusion. After the secretin was infused the child6 had a dramatic increase in -- I believe it was7 trypsin, amylase and lipase. This has been reported8 in a small subset of children to be remarkable in9 restoring their former normal neurodevelopment, and10 the mechanisms of that are all worked out, but it's11 undeniably true that there are children that12 dramatically benefit from this.13 The most remarkable example was a child that 14 was going in, who happened to be autistic, went into15 Dr. Horvath's lab at University of Maryland sometime16 in the late nineties, and had a secretin infusion17 which was purely at that point designed to try to18 figure out how his gut disease -- you know, what was19 going on with his chronic diarrhea, and I can't recall20 the details of how non-verbal he was or if he only had21 a few words, but he essentially started talking in22 sentences, and what happened then was that there was a23 big rush in this country for everybody to use24 secretin, and many parents paid a lot of money and25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 127 of 2391582 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888were very disappointed that their child didn't have1 similar results.2 So, I use this as an example of how there 3 may be many contributing factors to autism, and for4 how -- then when we tested secretin in the alleged,5 you know, good trial, the effects washed out, and what6 happened was that there was a small population of kids7 that did great and improved dramatically. Then there8 were other kids who didn't improve. So that when you9 looked at the results all together it showed that10 there was no improvement.11 So, in William, my understanding was that 12 Dr. Green was using that very dramatic information13 from Mass. General to inform a rational treatment plan14 by providing digestive enzymes to the patient. So,15 that's the first part of the answer, which is that it16 may be affected by mercury when the normal pancreatic17 enzymes are low, and when we give secretin the child18 improves.19 There is another more complicated answer 20 which is that the use of digestive enzymes tends to21 not only improve the gut status of the children in22 terms of helping them absorb their nutrients, because23 one of the issues that concern me about William Mead24 when I saw that he had virtually undetectable levels25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 128 of 2391583 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888of the enzymes that would have made him break down1 proteins and fats and carbohydrates was that2 essentially he had been operating with his tank empty3 for quite awhile, and he wasn't able to turn those4 food stuffs into his body part, so by definition that5 was another piece of evidence that caused me to6 conclude that he was under chronic oxidative stress.7 So, the second part of it is above and 8 beyond treating the child so that they can absorb9 their food and utilize their amino acids and their fat10 correctly, there is also the issue of how if you lack11 digestive enzymes you're likely to be presenting with12 chronic GI symptoms, and I am one of those that's13 concerned, based on what parents have told me over and14 over, that when the child's gut is not good the child15 has more autistic symptoms, and all those mechanisms16 remain to be worked out, but there is a body of17 literature looking at how that happens.18 Welch, for example, did a study in animals 19 in which she actually gave them gut inflammation, and20 looked at their brains, and the gut inflammation did21 impact on neurologic function.22 So, that is my best and shortest answer 23 about the relevance of looking at digestive enzymes in24 children with autism.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 129 of 2391584 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Before you 1 go on for my own reference and I'll ask you to do this2 perhaps beforehand, the reference that you had to page3 6 of Dr. Mumper's report.4 MR. JOHNSON: Sure, Special Master. 5 BY MR. JOHNSON: 6 Q Doctor, you mentioned the secretin study. 7 Isn't it true that in that study that that was a8 placebo double-blinded trial, correct?9 A Right. 10 Q And isn't it true that in that study it was 11 actually the children who received the placebo that12 showed more improvement?13 A That was not my understanding. My 14 understanding was that there were either one or two15 dramatic responders in the treated group whose16 responses were wiped out when the data was analyzed in17 a way that would show the overall effect on the whole18 population.19 And the reason that I'm pretty sure about 20 this is that we've used this as more impetus to try to21 develop biomarkers for subpopulations or symptom22 constellations for subpopulations so that when we do23 clinical research we're not putting apples and oranges24 and cantaloupes and bananas together in treating all25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 130 of 2391585 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888those differences with one single treatment.1 I don't deny that the placebo response is 2 real.3 Q And the result of that study and the 4 conclusion of that study was that secretin was not5 effective in treating the symptoms of autism, is that6 correct?7 A That is correct as I've just explained. 8 Q Your discussion of the digestive enzymes and 9 the issues with the gut, does that relate to -- I'm10 trying to find a page reference for the Special11 Masters -- does that relate to your reference to12 intestinal dysbiosis? And this is on page 6 of the13 William Mead report.14 A Again, I don't have the pagination so can 15 you tell me what the bolded title is?16 Q It's \"Clinical Evidence Compatible With 17 Damage from Mercury\".18 A Yes. Not directly, no. 19 Q What do you mean by intestinal dysbiosis? 20 A In children who have received multiple 21 antibiotics, especially if they were given in the very22 early period of time as with Jordan King where his23 mother got antibiotics during pregnancy, during24 delivery and then she also got them while she was25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 131 of 2391586 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888breast feeding, that interferes with the process1 called immune modulation.2 The gut is actually a very important part of 3 modulating the immune system. Normally what happens4 is that the baby is populated with things like5 lactobacillus and bifida bacteria from the mother's6 breast milk, and those are so-called good flora that7 do things for us like making vitamins and8 demethylating mercury, for example, methyl mercury9 here primarily, not ethyl.10 And so if you have a situation in which 11 because of early antibiotic use, and those of us at12 ARI are concerned even about one or two courses of13 antibiotics when given very early on in infancy, you14 can see a pattern where the good bacteria are wiped15 out and that interferes with the normal balance in the16 gut where the good bacteria and the good yeast are17 trying to fight out and live in symbiosis with18 organisms which might otherwise become pathogenic.19 So, we look for intestinal dysbiosis to look 20 for low levels of these good bacteria so that we can21 potentially use probiotics to elevate the good22 bacteria. One of the reasons that we like to do that23 is that when you do that in early infancy you actually24 have less incidence of asthma and allergies as the25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 132 of 2391587 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888child ages as shown in a large European study. So, we1 look for that and treat it in the context of treating2 the whole child.3 Q Now, you're not a gastroenterologist, is 4 that correct?5 A That's correct. 6 Q And this concept of intestinal dysbiosis and 7 the involvement of the gut, did that originate with8 Dr. Wakefield's research?9 A I do not think so. I think that that 10 concept had been around before Dr. Wakefield, but he11 certainly also agrees that that is an important part,12 so he's certainly talked about that, and I have to say13 I agree with him that it is an important factor.14 Q And Dr. Wakefield's research involved the 15 measles component of the MMR vaccine, is that correct?16 A That's correct. 17 Q Okay. Do you believe that the MMR vaccine 18 was a substantial contributing factor to William19 Mead's development of autism?20 A You know, I don't really know. I am worried 21 about it. I'm concerned about triple live virus22 vaccine being presented to a potentially oxidatively23 stressed child with prior antibody cues. I don't have24 a way of knowing with certainty to what extent MMR may25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 133 of 2391588 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888have contributed, but my understanding was that in1 this particular case my task was to look at the2 thimerosal-containing components, and that there were3 other cases that were going to examine MMR alone, or4 potentially even MMR and TCV in combination.5 Q So you just didn't look at the MMR, is that 6 what you're saying?7 A No. I looked at it and I believe that I 8 listed when he got it, which as I recall -- let me9 make sure -- he got it at the so-called usual time, 1210 months. He also received Varivax on the same day.11 Q And so you included it in your differential 12 --13 A Yes. 14 Q Okay. And you ruled it out? 15 A No. 16 Q Let's now move on to Jordan King and talk a 17 little bit about your report in his case.18 A Okay. 19 Q On page 4 of that report, and it's actually 20 under the section that begins on page 3, \"Clinical21 Evidence\", you note a number of other potential22 exposures for Jordan, including pesticides,23 fungicides, toluene, and tuna.24 A Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Filed 10/23/08 Page 134 of 2391589 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q What role do those exposures play in your 1 causal analysis?2 A At the time that I was writing this report I 3 was developing a differential diagnosis in which I was4 trying to see any possible contributors. Our work at5 ARI has led us to be concerned about fungicides, some6 of which contain mercury and many of which were taken7 off the market because of their mercury content.8 Pesticides are in our differential diagnosis 9 of what can be harmful to some children with autism. 10 A lot of that work has been looked at by Paul Shattuck11 and others.12 The toluene that went on the deck, I wasn't 13 sure at the time that I wrote this report whether or14 not the child was playing on the deck or playing in15 the yard at the time that it was applied, and so I16 wanted to raise that as a potential co-existing or17 exacerbating toxicity.18 Since then I'm actually less concerned about 19 it because I was able to interview Mrs. King and find20 out that she actually took her son to the park and the21 museum that day because she was very environmentally22 savvy mom who did not want him to be exposed.23 Then the tuna is a potential source of 24 methyl mercury, and especially in a child who has25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 135 of 2391590 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888chronic diarrhea where his normal gut mechanisms or he1 has low selenium so that his ability to excrete other2 sources of mercury might be impaired. I thought it3 was only fair to include things in my report that4 could be possible contributing factors to his autism.5 Q You've addressed the toluene. Were you able 6 to rule out the pesticides as a potential contributing7 cause?8 A I really don't know how to rule out the 9 pesticides or fungicides as a contributing cause based10 on the medical records that I have. No.11 Q And you noted in your report that Jordan ate 12 a lot of tuna which could also contribute to the total13 mercury load, is that correct?14 A That is correct. 15 Q Is it part of your opinion that Jordan 16 suffered from glutathione deficiency?17 A I don't think that we have direct evidence 18 of that, but based on evaluating many children similar19 to him and looking at John Green's clinical20 decisionmaking and also taking into consideration the21 fact that the parents report improvements with therapy22 that we design in order to make glutathione work23 better, specifically the methyl cobalamin injections24 which provide the precursors to make more glutathione,25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 136 of 2391591 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888and if I'm not confusing the cases, I believe Mrs.1 King testified that even now she can tell if a day2 goes by when he doesn't get his MB12 shots.3 So given the fact that I'm trying to 4 evaluate a child who was presenting in 2001-2002, all5 of those are consistent to me, although indirectly and6 inferentially, with glutathione deficiency, yes.7 Q I want to direct your attention to -- it's 8 actually mentioned in your report, but the actual9 record cite is Jordan King Exhibit 1 at 3, and we'll10 pull that up for you. This is a note that indicates11 that Jordan is doing amazingly well with B-12 and12 glutathione, is that correct?13 A Yes, and it says \"incredible difference, 14 just wanted you to know.\"15 Q And this appears to be perhaps one of the 16 parents who called in. It looks like MyLinda King who17 called in and reported that, is that correct?18 A That's correct. 19 Q Okay. And the date that this was called in, 20 this is April 19th, it looks like 2001, is that right?21 A I think so, yes. 22 Q Looking at the records, it appears that, and 23 this is Jordan King Exhibit 8 at pages 21 to 22, let's24 pull the date up on this. So this is a few months25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 137 of 2391592 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888later, it says that, \"Jordan demonstrates a high level1 of distractibility. He is able to maintain a sitting2 posture, demonstrates dynamic mobility but without3 purposeful attention to anyone passed.\"4 Does that indicate that glutathione and B-12 5 were making him improve?6 A You are drawing one aspect of a record that 7 demonstrates he's not doing well, and asking me to8 make a judgment about one particular therapy given9 many months before. I would have to in that situation10 know more information about what Mrs. King was11 thinking and specifying when she said \"doing amazingly12 well.\" She may have meant that he was attending to13 task more, or she may have meant that he was talking14 more, or she may have meant that's when he started15 showing more affection to her, or playing with his16 sister or any other number of other things.17 Q In your practice, what do you typically look 18 for to see whether therapy such as B-12 or glutathione19 are causing improvements? Is there any one particular20 thing?21 A We have a 145 question questionnaire that we 22 use. When we do methyl cobalamin injections, we do a23 five-week period of time in which the parent is asked24 not to start any different interventions or not to25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 138 of 2391593 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888start any new therapy. We ask the parents to fill out1 the questionnaire but we also ask the parents to keep2 all the therapists blinded, all the relatives blinded3 as to the intervention.4 We bring the family back five weeks later, 5 and the parents have filled out this behavioral6 questionnaire, so in that piece of it there is7 inherent reporting bias and the potential for placebo8 effect, which I acknowledged up front. But we also9 asked for notes from the therapists.10 It's ideal if we can get like the number of 11 words he was saying in speech therapy before the B-1212 and then the number he was saying at the five-week13 point and compare that to his previous trajectory of14 progress.15 So whereas we expect that children will 16 improve over time, what we're looking for is a change17 in the trajectory of that improvement, and in my18 experience having done this now in at least 200 kids,19 if not more, our experience is that we find20 demonstrable behavioral, language, et cetera,21 improvements in a substantial subset, probably greater22 than 50 percent in my experience.23 The other thing that we know that we're 24 doing though, even in the absence of clinical25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 139 of 2391594 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888improvements in speech or repetitive behaviors or1 social interactions or the so-called autistic2 stereotypic behaviors is that if we have a child who3 has demonstrated to us that he does not have4 glutathione in adequate amounts or that he has low5 methionine and therefore has that crucial methylation6 biochemistry disrupted such that he's not making good7 cell membranes, he's not regulating his genes8 appropriately, he's not making normal9 neurotransmitters, I feel that there is justification10 in fixing that biochemistry and the improvements in11 the autism symptoms are nice for the families and a12 wonderful bonus, but not the only reason to do the MB-13 12, if that makes sense.14 Q Okay, let me ask you this. In the William 15 Mead case, you testified that if there was no evidence16 of oxidative stress, you would not be able to reach17 the same opinion.18 In Jordan King's case, is oxidative stress 19 essential to your opinion that his autism was20 substantially contributed to by thimerosal-containing21 vaccines?22 A You know, I have a little bit different 23 formulation on him because I think that he has more24 evidence, at least for the potential of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 140 of 2391595 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888environmentally-mediated synergistic toxicities. I1 think he has a different pattern in that he got2 antibiotics very early on but not continuously. You3 know, once he was born, he never really got the4 antibiotics himself, so my issues with risk factors in5 him are related to gut issues also.6 I do think that he had times at which he was 7 under oxidative stress. I just don't have a marker8 retrospectively for quantifying that at the time of9 receipt of his thimerosal-containing vaccines or at10 the time he was trying to process those.11 Q And again, I apologize. I'm trying to find 12 a page cite. Maybe you can help me. This is where13 you comment on Jordan's amino acid analysis and14 indicate that it demonstrated impaired xenobiotic15 detoxification.16 A By the language, I am assuming that that was 17 one of the functional labs that had a chart and again18 this is looking at function and not in-born errors of19 metabolism. They have looked at the biochemistry and20 made assessments of clinical clues on the basis of the21 analytes that would be suggestive of xenobiotic22 toxicity, and so that is relevant in that we include23 that in our differential diagnosis.24 Q And when you were reviewing the records, did 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 141 of 2391596 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888you see records from a Dr. Anadiotis? That's1 A-N-A-D-I-O-T-I-S.2 A I think so because I think that we talked 3 about it yesterday.4 Q Okay. And if we look at Jordan King Exhibit 5 12, page 21.6 A Yes. 7 Q Dr. Anadiotis noted that Jordan never had 8 true metabolic testing and that he was struck by the9 differences in the laboratory values assumed to be10 abnormal by the treatment centers versus those11 reference values that I know he knew are used in12 academic institutions across the country, is that13 correct?14 A That's correct. 15 Q And as a result of that, Dr. Anadiotis 16 recommend that Jordan receive standard immunoacid17 testing?18 A Yes, a standard plasma immunoacid and a 19 urine organic acid study, and I did not see that in20 his record, so I do not know if that was done.21 Q Was that not testing that was done at Oregon 22 Health Sciences on September 27, 2001? I can show23 those to you.24 A Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe so. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 142 of 2391597 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Do you have the previous page that would 1 show the analytes.2 Q We're showing that up now. 3 A Okay. 4 Q Is it your understanding that this is the 5 testing that was recommended by Dr. Anadiotis?6 A Yes. 7 Q Okay. And do you agree that the conclusion 8 of that test was that there were no diagnostic9 findings?10 A Yes. Can I see the first page back again 11 though? I'm sorry.12 Again, the standard utilization for that 13 test is to look for in-born errors of metabolism. The14 thing that might potentially be informative in this15 case again has to do with methylation biochemistry in16 that there was a low cysteine. Without it up now, I17 think it was like 13 when the normal was 22 to18 something. Even on the standard university test was19 showing up and that's an area that we're particularly20 concerned with with our methylation biochemistry21 cycles.22 So again, a functional isolated inferential 23 suggestion that there may be problems in the pathway,24 and that's all I can really get from that, and I25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 143 of 2391598 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888totally acknowledge that the university test is not1 showing in-born errors of metabolism.2 Q Doctor, would it be fair to say that your 3 opinions in this case that are primarily or in large4 part based on your belief that certain treatments that5 were provided to both William Mead and Jordan King6 were effective?7 A In some part, yes. 8 Q Okay. And that's also based on your own 9 clinical observations from your practice, is that10 correct?11 A That's correct. 12 Q But you have not published any control 13 studies based on your patient population except for,14 or you haven't published any control studies, have15 you?16 A No. 17 Q Okay. You said that you were slow to come 18 around to chelation but you do actually chelate19 children in your clinic, is that correct?20 A I do now, yes. 21 Q Okay. What happens biochemically when you 22 chelate a child?23 A It depends somewhat on the agent, but the 24 basic idea is that you're trying to use an agent to25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 144 of 2391599 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888grab on like a claw is where the word \"chelate\" goes1 to, and escort the offending agent, whether it's lead2 or mercury, out of the body, frequently largely in the3 stools and urine.4 Q And I believe that you testified that it's 5 your understanding that chelation does not remove6 mercury from the brain, is that correct?7 A That's correct. 8 Q Do you chelate your patients with the 9 oversight of an institutional review board?10 A No. 11 Q Would you agree that the Defeat Autism Now 12 consensus statement says with relation to chelation13 therapies that no well controlled outcome studies have14 yet been performed?15 A Yes. 16 Q Is that still true today? 17 A Yes, that is true. We were hoping to get 18 that done through NIH, and I was working with Sue19 Swedo but the project got stalled. That was about a20 year ago.21 Q Is DMSA approved by the FDA for treating 22 mercury toxicity?23 A No, but it is approved for lead toxicity, 24 and I typically start with the FDA-approved agents and25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 145 of 2391600 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888typically use DMSA first. Most of my patients have at1 least history consistent with and some evidence of2 lead when I do that.3 Q Do you also use the gluten-free, casein-free 4 diet in your practice?5 A Yes, I do. 6 Q How does the gluten-free, casein-free diet 7 treat thimerosal-related autism?8 A I'm not at all sure that it does. 9 Q So if a child showed improvements on the 10 diet, that wouldn't really be supportive, in your11 opinion, of mercury toxicity?12 A In terms of directly, no. 13 Q Do autistic children who haven't received 14 biomedical intervention ever improve?15 A Yes. 16 Q Dr. Mumper, we asked you earlier whether you 17 were the one that was responsible for selecting Jordan18 King's and William Mead's cases as test cases for this19 proceeding, is that correct?20 A Yes. 21 Q Why did you choose those two cases as test 22 cases?23 A Well, it was a complex set of decisions. 24 One was that they were kids that we had some evidence25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 146 of 2391601 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888of mercury excretion on them. Secondly, we wanted to1 put forward some instructive cases and I conceived of2 these cases differently. I didn't want to bring3 forward, you know, the first three test cases that all4 essentially had the same history.5 So these cases represented to me clinical 6 patterns that I see in my practice, and William Mead7 represented to me the kids that have a lot of8 antibiotics, ear infections, respiratory infections,9 plus or minus asthma and allergies, and Jordan King10 represented to me a child where the potential11 vulnerability probably happened earlier on with his12 mother's antibiotic use during pregnancy, and also13 raised the issue of synergistic toxicities.14 In both case, I thought that there was very 15 good evidence that they weren't classic autism cases16 from either a chromosomal standpoint or the children17 with autism who seem to be abnormal from birth. So18 their pattern of initially being developmentally19 normal, being exposed to an agent that could breakdown20 to inorganic mercury in their brain, and then having a21 subsequent regression with loss of milestones and then22 emergence of autistic behaviors seemed to provide two23 patterns that will need to be tested in the system.24 It would be nice if we could take kids who 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 147 of 2391602 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888had more laboratory data, but one of the things that I1 ethically felt bound by was this idea that we should2 test some cases for the kids that weren't able to get3 the million dollar workup, and where we would be4 forced to rely on things like clinical histories and5 the reports of the parents.6 So of the six or seven cases that I was 7 given to review, those are the reasons that I can8 recall that I ended up choosing these two.9 Q Can you now tell us without talking about 10 specific cases, but some specific reasons that you11 decided not to choose the other cases that you12 reviewed?13 A In many of them, I had such little 14 informative laboratory data that I didn't think that I15 would be able to make a strong enough case because I16 do want this process to be driven by the science, and17 I was concerned that if we didn't have at least some18 type of biomarkers to present, that there was a19 possibility that the parents' stories might continue20 to receive less than the respect that I think that21 they deserve.22 Q And when you say the lab testing, what 23 particular lab testing was not present in those cases24 that caused you to think that you would not be able to25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 148 of 2391603 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888form an opinion?1 A Well, I honestly don't remember because I 2 was reviewing these in September, October, and since3 then I've seen a lot of patients and given a lot of4 lectures, but what I would have been looking for would5 be something that could tie it to some type of6 footprint for mercury or some type of footprint for7 methylation and transsulfuration abnormalities, and so8 it was a relative value strength type of judgment. 9 And I'm sorry, and clear documentation of regression10 was also an important criteria for me.11 Q Doctor, you are a member of the American 12 Association of Pediatrics, is that correct?13 A The American Academy of Pediatrics? 14 Q Yes. 15 A Correct. 16 Q I'm sorry. Have you ever served on any 17 committees for the American Academy of Pediatrics?18 A Yes. 19 Q Okay. What committees? 20 A The School Health Committee back many years 21 ago, and currently we're actually being sought out by22 the American Academy of Pediatrics for our opinions on23 these issues. I was invited to meet in March with the24 current president, the upcoming president, the head of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 149 of 2391604 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888mental health for the AAP, the executive director and1 a couple of other people that I'm forgetting, and we2 made plans for them to sit down with 15 or so of the3 so-called senior clinicians and researchers in DAN,4 Defeat Autism Now, who will -- we hope to have a5 brain-storming session and interchange where we try to6 teach them some of what we think we know, and they7 represent the importance of, you know, vaccines for8 public health reasons, and we come to some kind of9 plan for how to make vaccines safer.10 Q Is that a formal committee? 11 A No, not yet, but it will be a formal brain- 12 storming session think tank, potentially an ad hoc13 committee. I'm not sure where the plans will lead.14 Q So the one committee on school health back 15 many years ago, that's the only committee you've16 actually served on with the American Academy of17 Pediatrics?18 A To the best of my recollection yes. 19 Q Have you ever served on any NIH committees? 20 A No. 21 Q Are you a member of any NIH councils? 22 A No. 23 Q Have you ever received a research grant from 24 NIH?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 150 of 2391605 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A No, nor have I applied. 1 Q Have you ever served on an editorial board 2 for a scientific journal?3 A Yes, but only once. 4 Q And which journal was that? 5 A American College of Physicians and Surgeons. 6 Q And you were actually on the editorial board 7 of that --8 A Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I may have misunderstood 9 the question. I did misunderstand the question.10 I was not on the editorial board. I was 11 asked to be a reviewer.12 Q And how many articles did you review for 13 that journal?14 A Only two or three. I'm primarily a 15 clinician, so it's really without -- you know, outside16 the scope of a typical clinician to even do clinical17 research, write papers, you know, review them, et18 cetera.19 Q When was the last time that you reviewed an 20 article for the Journal of American College of21 Physicians and Surgeons?22 A Between two and three years ago, I would 23 guess, but I'm fuzzy on the date.24 Q In the past few years, it appears that most 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 151 of 2391606 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888of your professional involvement has been with the1 Autism Research Institute and Defeat Autism Now. Is2 that a fair statement?3 A That is a fair statement. 4 Q And I believe you have a position with 5 Autism Research Institute?6 A Yes, I am their medical director. 7 Q Is that a paid position? 8 A I get a stipend for organizing the 9 conferences twice a year. We plan them over a six-10 month period. I'm gone away from my practice for six,11 no, I'm sorry, eight days, and the stipend is either12 16 or 18 thousand dollars for that meeting.13 Q You mentioned that when you were a member of 14 the faculty at the University of Virginia that you15 received a student -- oh, an award --16 A Resident. 17 A -- voted on by the students. Did you 18 receive any awards that were decided by the faculty?19 A No. 20 Q It appears from your CV that you left UVA or 21 stopped teaching at UVA about the same time that you22 got involved with the Autism Research Institute, is23 that correct?24 A I need to clarify what my situation was 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 152 of 2391607 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888there. I was not actually teaching at the UVA campus. 1 I was teaching in a residency program for family2 physicians that was affiliated with the University of3 Virginia, so I was actually leaving Central Hospital4 and the residency program, and not leaving the UVA5 campus.6 Q When was the last time or how long ago was 7 it when you last taught a student from UVA?8 A I think about three years ago I had a 9 student in the nurse practitioner school at UVA for a10 year.11 Q Are you sure it wasn't more like 2000 that 12 you last taught a student at UVA?13 A Are you talking about a medical student from 14 UVA?15 Q Yes, a medical student. 16 A Okay. Well, around 2000, I would have been 17 teaching medical students through the residency, and18 I'm trying to remember if any of the medical students19 that I had post-2000 were from UVA. I don't think20 that they were. I think they were all from other21 places.22 Q And isn't it true that in 2005 the 23 university actually decided to terminate your position24 because you hadn't taught any students for a number of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 153 of 2391608 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888years?1 A That's correct. 2 Q You mentioned during your direct examination 3 that in your practice you have about --4 A Oh, I'm sorry. Can I modify my last answer? 5 The letter that I received was that they 6 weren't going to renew my position teaching residents7 because I had not taught them for many years. I8 actually did get my appointment renewed for several9 years after I left the residency, so I'm concerned10 about the connotation of the word \"termination\" versus11 not renewing my clinical appointment.12 Q Doctor, you testified during your direct 13 examination that you had medical records for about14 2,000 patients in your clinic, is that correct?15 A Two thousand total patients. That includes 16 general pediatric patients.17 Q How many of those patients do you follow on 18 an ongoing basis?19 A I really don't have a good way of estimating 20 that. I'll tell you that I see patients typically21 three and a half to four days a week, and that it's22 usually about 35 patients a week.23 Q How many of the 2,000 patient files that you 24 have in your office were consultations from other25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 154 of 2391609 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888physicians?1 A I would suspect about 100 because the vast 2 majority of those 2,000 files, you understand, are3 primary care pediatric patients that, you know, the4 parents choose me out of the phone book or by word of5 mouth or whatever, but I think probably about 100.6 Q Okay, and I believe you testified that about 7 four to five hundred of your patients are your autism8 patients, is that correct?9 A I think that's correct, but it's difficult 10 for me to nail down the exact number because of the11 way my records are set up.12 Q And the 100 files, or around 100 files that 13 you think are consultation files, are those autism14 patients that have been referred to you?15 A Some of them are. I actually also get 16 consultations from other doctors for things like17 chronic diarrhea, chronic failure to thrive, food18 allergies, situations in which the referring doctor19 might perceive that the parents are concerned about20 chronic illnesses that the referring pediatrician21 doesn't have either the time or interest to be able to22 address in a busy pediatric practice.23 Q So, four to five hundred, I guess, is your 24 best estimate for your autism patients?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 155 of 2391610 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Correct. 1 Q For how many of those four to five hundred 2 patients have you concluded that a thimerosal-3 containing vaccine caused or contributed to their ASD4 diagnosis?5 A I have no way of knowing that. 6 Q I mean, Doctor, they are your patients, and 7 I assume that you've reviewed their records, right?8 A Right. 9 Q And you've performed an examination. 10 A Right. 11 Q And you've taken histories from their 12 parents, correct?13 A Right. 14 Q So you actually have more information about 15 those patients than you had when you prepared your16 reports in these cases, so it seems to me you would17 have to be able to ballpark the number of those18 patients that you believe their autism was contributed19 to by thimerosal-containing vaccines.20 A Okay. So I do know that based on the review 21 of my last 156 patients, only about 50 percent of them22 were clearly regressive. So, one could postulate that23 the number from which I would draw the thimerosal-24 containing vaccine contributed patients would be half25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 156 of 2391611 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888of four to five hundred, so 200 to 250. So, I would1 say somewhere less than 200 patients, somewhat more2 than one.3 Q So between one and 200 of the four or five 4 hundred you would estimate their autism or ASD was5 contributed to by thimerosal-containing vaccines?6 A It's very difficult to work out the subset. 7 Yeah, obviously, this has not been well studied, and8 again I really resist the idea of trying to give a9 number to the clinical work that I do.10 Q You believe there is an epidemic of autism, 11 correct?12 A I do believe that there is an epidemic of 13 neurodevelopmental disorders. The best numbers are14 that one in six children in this country now has a15 neurodevelopmental disorder. That comes right from16 the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the CDC17 reports one in 150 children now with autism.18 Q And in fact you've stated in the past that 19 in Virginia where you practice there was an eleven-20 fold increase in autism cases since 1988, is that21 accurate?22 A That's based on DOE data, Department of 23 Education data, and that obviously is subject to the24 idea that there is potentially some ascertainment bias25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 157 of 2391612 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888and all those things that have been looked at. But1 yes, those were the numbers that I was given.2 Q And you mentioned the notion of 3 ascertainment bias. What percentage of the increase4 would you attribute to ascertainment bias?5 A I don't know, but I think that it is real, 6 so somewhere between 15 to 40 percent perhaps. It's a7 matter of some subject. I don't believe that there is8 diagnostic substitution. I do think that the term9 \"ASD\" may be used more broadly now, but you recall10 that the reason that I went into this work is that I11 perceived there was a qualitative change in children,12 and so before I ever knew the DOE numbers, I was13 seeing something in my practice, and that was,14 frankly, before I had even thought about thimerosal or15 toxin-induced autism, or you know, any of those16 issues.17 Q And that leads to my next question. What 18 percentage of the eleven-fold increase that you saw19 since 1988 did you attribute to thimerosal-containing20 vaccines?21 A I don't know. I don't know. 22 Q Do you have any guess at all? 23 A You know, I really don't. I don't want to 24 be tied down to a number for something that's not been25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 158 of 2391613 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888well studied.1 Q The amount of thimerosal that children 2 receive through vaccines increased from the 1980s to3 the 1990s, is that correct?4 A That is correct. 5 Q Okay. When did you the schedule change? 6 A To the best of my recollection, Hib vaccine 7 was added around 1988, and actually now that I think8 about it, you had asked me if I had participated in9 any controlled studies, and I did participate in the10 Hib vaccine trial in my clinical practice back then.11 In the early 1990s, Hepatitis B vaccine was 12 introduced at birth, and then prevnar somewhat later. 13 So there were changes over a period of five to seven14 years.15 Q What amount of thimerosal did a child 16 receive in 1985 if he or she received the full17 schedule of vaccines?18 A I would think that at that point it would 19 have been five DPTs, which would have been 2520 micrograms, so that would be half of 125, which is21 62.5 if I did my math right.22 THE WITNESS: Tom, did you check my math? 23 MR. POWERS: I did not. 24 THE WITNESS: Thanks a lot. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 159 of 2391614 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888MR. JOHNSON: It sounds right. 1 BY MR. JOHNSON: 2 Q When the schedule changed, and I believe 3 that was around 1994, is that correct?4 A Well, there were a series of changes. Hib 5 was '88-89. Hep B was '90-91, somewhere in there, and6 prevnar in the '94 range, if I'm remembering right.7 Q So by 1994, if a child received the full 8 schedule of vaccines, what amount of thimerosal would9 that child receive?10 A Counting or not counting the preschool 11 boosters?12 Q Not counting. 13 A I think it would have been 37.5 micrograms 14 after the initial infant series, including the Hib and15 the DPT boosters, but not including the four-year-old16 DPT boosters.17 Q Was there a corresponding increase in the 18 number of autism cases after 1984 - 1994?19 A My memory of the charts is that the increase 20 started in the -- the dramatic increase started in the21 late eighties and then continued throughout the22 nineties and early 2000s.23 Q And thimerosal was taken out of vaccines in 24 2001, correct?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 160 of 2391615 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Thimerosal, I take issue with that 1 statement. In 1999, the decision was made to phase2 out the use of thimerosal. Between '99 and 2001,3 efforts were made to manufacture vaccines without4 thimerosal. It was never taken off the shelves. So5 in looking at my patients who present to my clinic and6 looking at the lot numbers of their vaccines and7 trying to trace back whether or not it was thimerosal-8 containing or not, we had at least one patient in 20039 that received thimerosal-containing vaccines.10 The other thing that happened that involves 11 a continuing exposure to thimerosal is about the same12 time that we were getting the thimerosal out of the13 infant-containing vaccines, the recommendation was14 made to give thimerosal-containing flu vaccine to15 pregnant women, and in my community I order16 thimerosal-containing flu vaccine, and I typically run17 out by the end of October because 93 or so percent of18 the flu vaccine in this country still contains19 thimerosal.20 So, the question becomes how do you factor 21 in the potential vulnerability for thimerosal given in22 pregnancy at a time when some would argue the fetus23 might even be more vulnerable, and the fact that the24 recommendation was made that children receive25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 161 of 2391616 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888thimerosal-containing -- or flu vaccines, the vast1 majority of which is thimerosal-containing at six2 months, 12 months, and then every year thereafter.3 So, one of the calculations that has been 4 done is that even by taking away the thimerosal from5 the infant series if you have a situation in which the6 pregnant woman gets flu vaccine and the child gets flu7 vaccine, and it continues throughout early childhood,8 that your thimerosal load actually in the current9 system can be as much as 50 percent or so, the10 thimerosal that the kids got in the '90s. It's just11 time shifted and different distribution.12 Q Doctor, you would agree that the number of 13 autism cases has continued to increase since 2001?14 A Yes. 15 Q And is it your testimony here today that 16 that is because of the flu vaccine and maternal17 vaccinations?18 A No. I think that there are many, many 19 factors that as yet we need to look at.20 Q Doctor, you're familiar with the Institute 21 of Medicine, correct?22 A Yes. 23 Q And you're aware that the IOM looked at the 24 alleged link between thimerosal-containing vaccines25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 162 of 2391617 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888and autism?1 A I am. I was there. 2 Q It first conducted an investigation in 2001, 3 correct?4 A Yes, I was not there for that one. 5 Q And the IOM looked at the issue again in 6 2004, and that's the one you were involved in?7 A That's the one I attended. 8 Q You actually submitted a letter to the IOM 9 and --10 A I did, an impassioned letter. 11 Q And in 2004, the IOM concluded that the 12 evidence favored rejection of a causal relationship13 between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism,14 right?15 A That's correct. 16 Q And you already mentioned that you're a 17 member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, correct?18 A That's correct. 19 Q And you're aware that the AAP has taken a 20 position with respect to thimerosal-containing21 vaccines and autism?22 A Yes. 23 Q And would you agree that the AAP's position 24 is that no scientific data linked thimerosal use as a25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 163 of 2391618 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888preservative in vaccines with any pediatric1 neurological disorder?2 A Yes. 3 Q Doctor, you're familiar with the World 4 Health Organization?5 A Yes. 6 Q And you're aware that the WHO has issued a 7 position statement on the alleged link between TCVs8 and autism?9 A Yes. 10 Q And am I correct that the WHO has recently 11 stated, \"In the latest review by the committee at its12 meeting of 6 to 7 June, 2006, the conclusion13 previously reached was reaffirmed that there is no14 evidence of toxicity in infants, children or adults15 exposed to thimerosal in vaccines.\" Is that correct?16 A I was not aware that they had met in '06, 17 but I certainly take your word for that.18 Q Okay. And you are familiar with the CDC? 19 A Yes. 20 Q And you are aware that the CDC has taken a 21 position on this issue?22 A Yes. 23 Q And you would agree that the CDC supports 24 the IOM's conclusion?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 164 of 2391619 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A That's correct. 1 Q Are you aware or familiar with the Public 2 Health Agency of Canada?3 A No. 4 Q Okay. Are you aware that the Canadian 5 National Advisory Committee on Immunization has taken6 a position on the issue of thimerosal-containing7 vaccines and autism?8 A I wouldn't be surprised if they have. 9 Q Okay. Would you be surprised to know that 10 they concluded that the weight of the evidence to date11 clearly refutes an association between thimerosal and12 neurodevelopmental disorders?13 A I am surprised that they used the word 14 \"clearly refutes\".15 Q But you have no reason to dispute that that 16 was their conclusion?17 A No. 18 Q Are you familiar with the European Agency 19 for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products?20 A Not very, but I know of them. 21 Q Okay. And were you aware that that agency 22 has taken a position on this issue?23 A No, but I would not be surprised. 24 Q All right. Would it surprise you to know 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 165 of 2391620 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888that they concluded that the latest epidemiological1 studies show no association between the vaccinations2 of TCVs and specific neurodevelopmental disorders?3 A Not at all because I don't think that we 4 will ever be able to show an association if we rely5 upon epidemiology. It is our contention that this6 affects some as yet undetermined subset of children,7 and that they will not show up in epidemiology as the8 studies have been done to this point.9 Q And you would acknowledge that there have 10 been numerous epidemiological studies in the United11 States, Canada, and Europe that have looked at this12 issue?13 A I will, and I will have to tell you that 14 even as a pediatrician I perceived flaws in a number15 of those epidemiologic studies. I do not think that16 they have addressed the relevant question here.17 Q And you're not an epidemiologist, correct? 18 A Obviously not. 19 Q Doctor, as recently as this year the 20 American Academy of Pediatrics and the American21 Academy of Family Physicians reaffirmed their position22 on this issue in response to a television show that23 aired, were you aware of that?24 A I heard of it. I actually don't think I've 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 166 of 2391621 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888read the document.1 Q All right. And the American Academy of 2 Family Physicians issued a statement saying,3 \"Scientific data overwhelmingly show that there is no4 evidence between vaccines and autism,\" is that right?5 A That's correct. 6 Q And the American Academy of Pediatrics 7 issued a statement indicating that \"No scientific link8 exists between vaccines and autism,\" is that correct?9 A Yes, but please blow that up again. 10 The AAP said, \"No mercury is used as a 11 preservative in routinely offered childhood vaccines.\" 12 That has led many of my patients to make the13 assumption that since flu vaccine is now included on14 the schedule of recommended vaccines, that their15 children's flu vaccine does not contain thimerosal.16 Now, whatever the science shakes down on 17 this in the years to come, whether this hypothesis is18 refuted or affirmed, I am very concerned that the19 American Academy of Pediatrics would make that20 statement because families are taking their kids in21 for flu shots thinking that they are avoiding22 thimerosal, and it is often not the case, and I have23 expressed that concern to the president of the AAP --24 I presume it was Rene Jenkins that wrote that letter.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 167 of 2391622 DR. MUMPER - CROSS ( RESUMED ) Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Could you get it back up? I'm sorry, please -- that I1 would like for them to be very careful, yes, about2 their language.3 Q Doctor, do you believe that your opinion 4 that thimerosal can contribute to autism is generally5 accepted in the medical community?6 A No, it is not generally accepted. 7 Q And would you agree that for most members of 8 the medical community the case is closed on the9 alleged link between vaccines and autism?10 A Sadly, I think that is the case. 11 MR. JOHNSON: Thank you. I have no further 12 questions.13 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Thank you, 14 counsel.15 It is now 1:15. I anticipate Petitioner's 16 counsel has some redirect.17 MR.

POWERS: 15 Q Good afternoon, Dr. Mumper. 16 A Good afternoon. 17 Q I see you're getting situated there. Are 18 you all set?19 A I think so. 20 Q Okay. Well, you recall yesterday afternoon 21 there were a series of questions that Respondent's22 counsel asked you. Do remember starting that cross-23 examination yesterday?24 A Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 171 of 2391626 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q You recall a line of questions about some of 1 the research that you were conducting. Do you2 remember those questions?3 A Yes. 4 Q And questions about hyperbaric therapy and 5 lab reliability testing?6 A Right. 7 Q Why is it that you were conducting those 8 tests in the first place, or conducting that research9 in the first place?10 A Our perception is that some of the research 11 efforts that have been going on in the field of autism12 have not been directed as much as we would like toward13 potential treatments and therapies and assessment14 methods that would actually lead fairly soon to taking15 better care of these children.16 Classically, the resources have been 17 directed to a lot of work in classic genetics, and we18 wanted to look at the treatment strategies that we had19 developed with our collective clinical wisdom and make20 sure that they were safe, ultimately evaluate efficacy21 in a more rigorous fashion, and to refine our use of22 laboratory assessments.23 It came to our attention that a number of 24 parents were renting hyperbaric chambers and we wanted25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 172 of 2391627 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888to make sure that they were not posing a risk to the1 children. So, we wanted to look at the methylation2 biochemistry and the oxidative stress markers.3 So, the initial study, which was just a 4 pilot study, was intended not to be so much a rigorous5 assessment of efficacy as it was the first step, which6 would be to prove safety, so that's why we chose to7 look at the methylation biochemistries, and since we8 were doing the study we also looked at therapeutic9 response, but the primary issue there was safety.10 With our lab split sample study, our primary 11 concern is that we are in a situation where we have12 found value in using so-called functional laboratory13 assessments. Many traditional laboratory assessments14 are targeted more toward the detection of disease as15 opposed to the detection of suboptimal function in the16 period of time leading to frank expression of disease.17 So, we wanted, as best we knew, as best we 18 could, to know that those functional assessments we19 were utilizing are replicable or to sort out which20 laboratories would not have reliability on split21 sample testing. So, ARI ended up budgeting over22 $30,000 of a pretty meager budget to essentially do23 the lab split sample study, and that will ultimately24 become known. It's certainly possible that some of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 173 of 2391628 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the labs we have relied on are stronger in some areas1 than others, and that's why we need to sort those2 issues out.3 Q Excuse me. Dr. Mumper, would it be your 4 intent then with hyperbaric study and the lab5 reliability study, if there are findings that you find6 significant would you then be integrating those into7 the Defeat Autism Now recommendations and protocols?8 A Yes. We shared some preliminary data on 9 split samples for allergy testing at the think tank10 that we held in April, and our plan is to also review11 at the think tank the split sample reliability for the12 other types of tests that we anticipate having13 statistically analyzed by then.14 Q So these safety and efficacy studies aren't 15 for your sort of proprietary use, but they are16 actually designed to be pushed out into the treatment17 community, is that correct?18 A Oh, exactly. That's entirely the purpose, 19 yes.20 Q Are there any other research projects you're 21 doing with that same general goal, that is, looking at22 the safety and the efficacy of various treatments that23 you employ?24 A Well, I've actually just hired a clinical 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 174 of 2391629 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888research director since I am primarily a clinician and1 a medical educator. I want to continue to participate2 in clinical research studies, but I wanted to have3 someone who could help me design them and carry out4 the protocols, so I hired someone that has had5 training in that arena so that when we do clinical6 trials and research at the Rimland Center that will7 not be under my -- limited by my relative lack of8 expertise, but we can actually continue to do higher9 quality and more complicated studies.10 One of the things that I'm very eager to do 11 is what's called single subject, multiple baseline12 studies, and the reason that I'm so interested in this13 is that our anecdotal impression is that what we can14 do to recover Johnnie might be totally different from15 what we can do to recover Suzie. And so we need to16 figure out what is working for specific kids, and what17 is it about those kids that makes that strategy of18 treatment more effective.19 So, when you group a bunch of kids together 20 and do the classic placebo controlled double-blind21 study, that works great for evaluating a drug in22 patients that have the same symptom. It doesn't work23 as well for a situation in which you've got complex24 multi-system involvement, and so a way of doing that25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 175 of 2391630 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888is to adapt some research from the behavioral world1 where they look at a single subject and document2 behaviors over time, and then do interventions and3 look at the change in the subject.4 Ted Carr is one of the people who has 5 published a fair amount using this type of research6 protocol, and he's actually contacted me. We have a7 phone conference call next week because he would like8 to do some of that type of research in our clinic,9 utilizing not just behavioral measures but also10 wedding it to biomarkers biomedically.11 So, I hope that my colleagues at ARI and I 12 can lead the way in looking at well-respected research13 models that we can apply to individuals as opposed to14 always thinking about research having to be done in15 broader groups.16 So another thing that we plan to do, I 17 mentioned that we've met with the American Academy of18 Pediatrics. My job that I'm a little behind on due to19 this trial was to provide the AAP with our sort of20 wish list for research projects. We want to go after21 what we think of as the low hanging fruit. The22 studies that we can do that can be completed23 relatively quickly so that the results can be utilized24 to help children.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 176 of 2391631 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888So, we are going to try to encourage 1 research on treatment protocols and especially on2 identifying biomarkers that help us subtype each of3 these types of autism, because our perspective is that4 the evolving model that we have regards a combination5 of genetic and environmental components, and perhaps6 lots of autisms, with an \"s\", this is language that's7 actually been adopted by the MIND Institute, and what8 it implies is that there may be a number of different9 ways that children are affected in ways that they10 ultimately exhibit autistic-type behaviors. So there11 may be a number of pathways that are affected to give12 us this constellation of behavioral symptoms.13 Q And, Dr. Mumper, is it typical or atypical 14 that a general practice pediatrician in a small town15 like Lynchburg would bother to hire a clinical16 research director?17 A I think that would be very atypical because 18 it's a severely financially unwise thing to do.19 Q If it's a financially unwise thing to do, 20 then why are you doing it?21 A Because I think it's the right thing to do. 22 I've thought about that question a lot, and I think23 one thing that influenced me on this is that when I24 was a child my house had a community swimming pool25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 177 of 2391632 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888just behind our back yard, and at that time, which was1 in the sixties, they would not allow people of color2 to come and swim in the swimming pool.3 So my father and my family took the stand 4 that we would then not participate, and so for all the5 summers of my childhood I would play in the back yard6 hearing the splashing from the swimming pool, and it7 in a way that was reenforcing over and over told me8 that my parents thought it was important that I stood9 up for what I thought was right.10 So, there have been significant personal and 11 professional disadvantages to speaking up in such a12 lone voice when there are clearly so many agencies13 that don't have the same concerns as I do, but I do14 think it's important to do what you think is right15 even if there are some sacrifices involved.16 Q What do you do to keep up with the science? 17 I mean, do you follow the literature? How do you keep18 engaged with the science that's happening out there?19 A Yeah. 20 Q Because you were asked about some of this, 21 about what articles you read and what articles you22 rely on, and how you form your opinions. Can you23 describe to the Special Masters what you do to keep24 apace of that?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 178 of 2391633 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A It's quite a challenge because I think I 1 mentioned I typically go to my office at 7:30 and2 leave about six, and most of that time is devoted to3 clinical practice. But in my job at ARI, one of my4 roles is to decide what literature we teach to the5 clinicians that we're teaching in the clinician6 seminars. So in order to make that distinction, I7 feel that it's necessary to try to keep up with the8 literature.9 So, I have a couple of list serves that send 10 me articles based about autism or related subjects,11 and I, you know, certainly can't read all of those12 articles, but I try to read as much as I possibly can.13 Another impetus I have is that I'm the 14 director for the clinical part of the think tank for15 the Autism Research Institute, so the scientists and16 clinicians have to submit their abstracts to me, and17 I'm the one that makes the judgment about what science18 they can present and what doesn't meet, you know, our19 expectations for presentation, so that helps me keep20 abreast of the science.21 The other thing is that I get invited to 22 speak in this country and overseas about these topics,23 and I like to be able to answer the questions when24 they're asked, and so I try to have a good grasp of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 179 of 2391634 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the scientific literature in addition to my clinical1 experience so that I can field those questions from2 the audience.3 Q Now, in this sort of monitoring and ongoing 4 review of the literature, is it your experience that5 in the field of autism there is significant new6 science that comes out in an evolving way?7 A I have seen it explode exponentially, and I 8 think that can be actually objectively validated by9 looking at the number of autism articles, and there is10 a big curve up over the last decade or so.11 The thing I also really like is that since I 12 am the medical director for ARI, I frequently will get13 prepublication confidential drafts of upcoming science14 with requests from the authors to make suggestions, I15 mean, obviously from my perspective as a clinician, on16 the way that they have written the papers or any17 aspects of the paper that I would critique or make18 suggestions on.19 Q Now, I want to focus a little bit on some of 20 the questions that you were asked about the content of21 your reports, and again focusing first on yesterday22 afternoon.23 A Okay. 24 Q Do you recall questions about the article 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 180 of 2391635 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888that was published in Medical Hypotheses ? 1 A Yes, I do. 2 Q And do you recall questions that suggested 3 you were relying on that article to bolster an opinion4 that mercury as contained in vaccines was neurotoxic5 or that it was somehow being cited in support of your6 ultimate opinion and causation? Do you remember that7 line of questions?8 A Yeah, and I actually don't think I 9 appreciated at the time perhaps the intent of the10 question. I was thinking that the intent of the11 question was to point out that it wasn't in a referee12 peer-reviewed journal and that it had been submitted13 by people who were not scientists.14 But the way that I cited the article, and I 15 think that I tried to make it very clear in my report16 was that it was to point to it as an example of17 mercury having myriad toxicities, and that it raised18 the issue of biochemical individuality in the patients19 because it specifically talks about things like route20 of excretion and individual variability and those21 types of issues.22 So, I certainly did not ever in any aspect 23 of my testimony here before this Court mean to imply24 that I was equating autism with direct mercury25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 181 of 2391636 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888toxicity. I would certainly agree that that is not1 the case. I would be embarrassed to put that2 hypothesis forward.3 Our concerns is a much more complicated one 4 having to do with a much more chronic condition5 resulting after low-dose exposures. Having said that,6 if you look at the actual sheet that's printed about7 thimerosal, there are side effects listed that are8 consistent with what some of these children have. 9 They list anorexia, for example, as a known effect of10 thimerosal. They list nausea and vomiting. They list11 fetal loss, and so I think that one thing that has12 been lost in this arena is the idea that we expect all13 drugs to have side effects, and we would expect that14 in vaccines there are going to be some children that15 have problems with them, hence the reason for this16 Court.17 Q But certainly not cited for the proposition 18 that autism, as you said, is the functional equivalent19 of acute mercury toxicity?20 A No, that is not my thesis at all. 21 Q Now, another article that you had in your 22 report that was discussed yesterday the first author23 is Stajich, and I never know if I'm pronouncing that24 right.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 182 of 2391637 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A I can't do it either. 1 Q Okay. So we will trade pronunciation skills 2 and math skills, but Scott, if you could put just the3 --4 MR. MATANOSKI: Actually we don't believe 5 that we discussed that article. That's what I was6 informed.7 MR. JOHNSON: I didn't ask any questions 8 about that article.9 BY MR. POWERS: 10 Q Well, put it this way, the article was cited 11 in your report.12 A Right. 13 Q And you were asked questions about why it 14 made sense to rely on articles in your report.15 A Right. 16 Q And why did you rely on the Stajich article 17 in your report?18 A Because it showed an outlier. They looked 19 at a small number of children, I believe it was about20 20, and in that one of the children had a level of21 23.6 micrograms per liter, I think, and my point in22 including it in my report was that, even in those 2023 kids, one of them was high enough to meet the criteria24 for acute mercury toxicity.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 183 of 2391638 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888That does not mean that I think that the 1 child had acute mercury toxicity. It was just to say2 that there is a wide variation in how individual3 children response.4 So if in that group of 20 we see one child 5 who is that high, what would happen if we looked at6 bigger populations and consider the possibility that7 there will be some children that are outliers and for8 whatever reason develop higher blood levels, and9 therefore potentially higher brain levels.10 I also want to make it clear that I'm not 11 concerned about what's in the blood. I'm concerned12 about what ultimately goes to the brain and other13 target tissues.14 Q Now you were asked questions about the 15 Berman article. Do you recall those questions?16 A Well, I think the way, if I'm remembering 17 right, that that happened was that they asked me about18 an article that was reported to have refuted the19 Hornig article.20 Q That's correct. 21 A Is that the one that's I'm remembering? 22 Q That's correct. 23 A So, I had not read that article, but I did 24 read it early this morning.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 184 of 2391639 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And having reviewed that article and then 1 thinking back to the questions where that article was2 being cited to refute Mattie Horning's article that3 you had cited in your report --4 A Right. 5 Q -- what do you think is significant in your 6 review relevant to that line of questioning that you7 heard yesterday?8 A Well, I actually found it very interesting 9 to read the article because that particular article10 was looking at acute toxicity, and in fact they were11 not doing any kind of measures of neuroinflammatory12 markers. They didn't speciate the mercury. They were13 looking at mice, which is a good model and it's what14 Mattie used, but they were not using probably the best15 model, which would be primates, and they also didn't16 say anything about inorganic mercury in the brain.17 What they did look at was, you know, 18 behaviors of the animals, and so whereas I acknowledge19 that it didn't find the same thing that Dr. Hornig20 did, we don't expect that in science, and it really21 doesn't impact in any way on making my opinions any22 less strong.23 Q Now, you mentioned the issue of mice or 24 rodents generally is not a good surrogate for human25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 185 of 2391640 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888exposure.1 A Right. 2 Q You were also asked questions specifically 3 about Dr. Burbacher and Clarkson's 2005 infant monkey4 study. Do you remember that line of questions?5 A I do. 6 Q Okay. 7 MR. POWERS: And Scott, if we could put the 8 cover page of that article up, I would appreciate it,9 and just zoom in on the title. I just want to make it10 for the record so that everybody knows what we're11 talking about here.12 BY MR. POWERS: 13 Q This the op cite at Petitioner's Exhibit 26, 14 and we're looking at the cover page. Do you see that15 on the screen there, Dr. Mumper?16 A Yes. 17 Q Your recollection of your cross-examination 18 yesterday, this is the article that would have been19 referred to when they were talking about the infant20 monkey study, correct?21 A Yes. 22 MR. POWERS: Okay. We can pull that down 23 now, Scott. I just wanted to make sure that we're all24 talking about the same document.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 186 of 2391641 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888BY MR. POWERS: 1 Q Now, that study, Dr. Mumper, involved 2 primates, correct?3 A Right. 4 Q What's the significance of primates in that 5 study?6 A Well, primates are an excellent model to 7 look at what might happen to humans, and can be used8 experimentally, and primates are much, obviously9 closely related to us than mice and rodents.10 I had the opportunity to hear Dr. Burbacher 11 present this, perhaps for the first time it was12 presented publicly, I'm not sure, but it was at NIEHS13 in August of 2005, and we discussed at that symposium14 how it was very interesting the way that this was15 presented in the press because it was actually spun in16 the lay press as good news because ethyl mercury was17 shown to clear the blood very quickly, and what all of18 us who are clinicians and scientists took away from19 the paper was a much more dire kind of take home20 message, which was that it cleared from the blood but21 ethyl mercury went to the brain, and ultimately led to22 inorganic mercury that was in the glial cells.23 Q And now the 2005 paper, did it say that the 24 inorganic mercury actually ended up in the glial cells25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 187 of 2391642 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888or just that it was inorganic mercury that entered the1 brain?2 A That perhaps it entered the brain. I'm 3 sorry.4 Q Now, the Burbacher paper that was the 5 subject of questioning yesterday, you remember a bunch6 of questions about blood levels?7 A Yes. 8 Q And there was a line of questions that 9 involved the relative blood clearance levels in this10 2005 paper --11 A Right. 12 Q -- between methyl and ethyl, correct? 13 A Right. 14 Q Is the distinction between blood clearance 15 rates between ethyl and methyl, is that why you16 thought this paper was important and included it in17 your report?18 A No. No. 19 Q Why did you include it in your report? 20 A Because of the issue of the inorganic 21 mercury being in the brain, and the fact that with22 ethyl mercury there was a significantly higher23 fraction from ethyl that got converted to inorganic24 mercury.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 188 of 2391643 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888And the other thing that I remember getting 1 chills up and down my spine about was listening to Tom2 present how when they looked at the half-life of the3 inorganic mercury, that they were projecting that it4 would be in terms of decades, and that because of the5 way the mercury went into the brain and was converted6 to inorganic, they thought that there was clear7 evidence for the possibility of accumulation of8 inorganic mercury over time as repetitive thimerosal-9 containing vaccines were administered.10 They also made a point in their paper which 11 I thought highly of because it agreed with my opinion12 that they found it very hard to understand how the13 Institute of Medicine could have concluded, in 2004,14 that no further science should be done on thimerosal15 since it was clear that we did not have good models16 for projecting about the pharmacokinetics of17 thimerosal.18 So, one of the points in the paper that was 19 discussed yesterday was that there are limitations to20 applying methyl mercury kinetics to thimerosal21 kinetics, but the concerning thing about that, when I22 heard him present this, is that it made me even more23 worried about ethyl mercury because of the very long24 half-life of the inorganic mercury and the relatively25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 189 of 2391644 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888higher fraction of ethyl mercury that was converted to1 inorganic versus methyl mercury, if that makes sense.2 Q Now, is it also fair to say that the 3 significance of the 2005 Burbacher/Clarkson study is4 related to other work that involves mercury speciation5 and neuroinflammation which is obviously a key part of6 your opinion in these cases?7 A Yeah, and I'm actually distressed to find 8 out over the years how long ago this information was9 known because there has been a lot published about10 mercury in the last several decades, and I think it11 was the mid-nineties that Clarkson did his work on12 methyl mercury. That was in adult monkeys, I believe.13 Q And are you talking Dr. Clarkson or Dr. 14 Burbacher and Charleston and Vahter?15 A Oh, I'm sorry. Not Clarkson. Yes, you're 16 right, Charleston, not Clarkson. I apologize.17 Q And I raise that because other witnesses -- 18 A Right. 19 Q We've got so many monkey studies going, 20 we've got to keep them straight, and some of the21 authors are shared.22 A Right. 23 Q If I could just use the shorthand, we're 24 talking about the adult monkey studies in the mid-25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 190 of 2391645 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888nineties?1 A Yes. 2 Q Okay. 3 A Yes. 4 Q And you cite Dr. Charleston's work in your 5 paper?6 A That's correct. 7 Q In your report. 8 A And I realize that that paper was about 9 methyl mercury and not ethyl mercury, but the reason10 that I thought it was important is because it11 demonstrates this idea of conversion to inorganic12 mercury and then the fact that there was13 neuroinflammation in the adult monkey brains and that14 we are so concerned about the neuroinflammation that15 we believe to be happening in these kids.16 Does that make sense? 17 Q Yes. So would it be fair to say that the 18 adult monkey studies establish that methyl mercury --19 A Right. 20 Q -- gets inorganic mercury into the brain? 21 A Exactly. 22 Q And that inorganic mercury in the brain goes 23 to glial cells?24 A Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 191 of 2391646 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And that having glial cells contain a lot of 1 mercury is evidence of neuroinflammation?2 A Right. 3 Q And then you then transition into the 2005 4 Burbacher/Clarkson paper where they talk about, just5 as was the case with methyl, you have ethyl that dumps6 inorganic mercury into the brain, is that correct?7 A That is correct. 8 Q We talked about the 2005 Burbacher paper as 9 if it was the whole study, but is it one paper or does10 it represent the entire study as far as you know?11 A Yeah, I think that Tom has said that they 12 have a whole series of ongoing studies on this. And13 when you read the paper very carefully, you will see14 that in the 2005 study that I heard him present at15 NIEHS they had just used half the brains.16 So, my understanding is that there are 17 further studies being conducted about the other half18 of those brains that I hope will be informative as to19 whether or not that replicates perhaps the adult20 findings with regard to neuroinflammation. We have to21 wait and see. That's part of the evolving science.22 Q Okay. Now, you also recall a line of 23 questionings about a deposition that you gave in the24 Blackwell case in Maryland. Do you remember those? I 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 192 of 2391647 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888think those questions might have been today rather1 than yesterday.2 A Yes, that was today. 3 Q Okay. I'm going to direct your attention if 4 we can pull it up to a page from that deposition5 transcript, and this is on the deposition it's page6 158.7 MR. POWERS: And, Scott, if you could under 8 the question \"By Ms. Elliott\", if you could highlight9 the rest of the page there, please.10 BY MR. POWERS: 11 Q Now, Dr. Mumper, during that deposition, 12 which was in January 2007, you were asked what it13 meant to have a -- it says, \"What does it mean to be a14 neurotoxin, in your mind?\"15 A And I said, \"It means that the substance has 16 either direct or indirect effects on some aspect of17 the nervous system, either directly on cells that are18 neurons, astrocytes, microglia, or whatever, or19 indirectly with regard to enzymes that it affects that20 in fact then affect the nervous tissue or in other21 ways interferes with functioning of neurologic22 capacity.\"23 Q Okay. I'm going to interrupt you there. So 24 would it be fair to say that neurotoxin, in your mind,25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 193 of 2391648 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888doesn't necessarily mean cell death? Is that a fair1 summary?2 A That's exactly correct. 3 Q Because what you're talking about is 4 functional toxicity explicitly.5 A Exactly. 6 Q Correct? 7 A Yes. 8 Q And when you talk about neurotoxicity in 9 your opinion in this case, both your testimonial10 opinion and in your report, are you also talking about11 functional toxicity primarily?12 A I am talking functional primarily, yes. 13 Q The statement that astrocytes, microglia are 14 involved in the neurotoxic process involving15 thimerosal-containing vaccines, what is that informed16 by? What was your basis then for saying that those17 particular cell types were involved?18 A At that time I had already had the 19 opportunity to speak with both Tom Burbacher and Diana20 Vargas about their works, so I was specifically21 thinking of their papers related to, for Dr.22 Burbacher, the monkey study, and for Dr. Vargas, the23 neuroinflammation neuroglial activation paper that was24 published at Hopkins.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 194 of 2391649 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And having been reviewing this information 1 back in January of 2007, you then had that information2 to rely on when you considered Dr. Kinsbourne's report3 that you reviewed about a month ago, correct?4 A Yes, and in addition, I would say that on a 5 number of occasions since I first heard the Vargas6 paper and the Burbacher paper I've had the opportunity7 to teach that in my clinician training because we8 really have regarded those as very seminal papers in9 our concept of what we need to teach clinicians about10 taking care of these children.11 Q There is a further question there that asks, 12 and Scott, you will need to bump down to the next page13 in a moment. The question is at the very bottom and14 it says, \"Are you offering an opinion that thimerosal15 is toxic to the immune system as well?\"16 So you see the question there and let's look 17 at the answer. What is your answer to that question?18 A \"I do believe that to be true, so I'm giving 19 that as an opinion, yes.\"20 Q And the question was about the immune system 21 being implicated here. Would your answer include the22 brain's innate immune system also?23 A Yes, it certainly would. One of the things 24 that we teach a lot about in our Defeat Autism Now25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 195 of 2391650 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888physician trainings is the importance of modulation of1 the immune system, both cell-mediated immunity and2 antibody immunity, but also the primitive innate sort3 of first response system.4 So, we're really not talking in the 5 neuroinflammatory model, we're specifically not6 talking about evidence of an adaptive response. We're7 talking about evidence of this early innate, more8 privative type of immune response, and that's best9 probably characterized by the microglia who act as10 macrophages to go in initially and try to mop up the11 toxins much like peripheral macrophages would.12 Q Okay, and we can be done with that page. 13 So, Dr. Mumper, I now want to move on and 14 talk about some of the questions that came later15 during the day today. Do you remember questions about16 how you diagnose autism? Do you remember that line of17 questioning?18 A Yes. 19 Q And do you remember questions particularly 20 about regressive autism?21 A Yes. 22 Q In diagnosing autism spectrum disorders, are 23 there domains of symptoms that you look at in making a24 diagnosis?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 196 of 2391651 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Yes. We look in areas such as communication 1 and stereotypic behaviors as well as social2 reciprocity.3 Q And those would be the three primary domains 4 or categories?5 A That's correct. 6 Q Within the communication category, what 7 would be included in there?8 A There is speech and then there is language, 9 and language has a broader implication about being10 able to communicate. Language doesn't necessary have11 to be speech. It could be gestures. It could be sign12 language. It could be using a picture system, those13 types of communication would also be involved.14 Q Because, as I recall, and correct me if I'm 15 wrong, the question seemed to focus on word counts --16 A Yes. 17 Q -- at particular ages. Do you remember that 18 line of questioning?19 A Yes, and I was very resistant to giving 20 typical word counts, if you will recall, because as I21 tried to make clear by talking about things like22 babbling and jargoning and gesturing, there are ways23 that children can communicate pragmatically without24 using words. For example, if you have a child who is25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 197 of 2391652 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888able to point to an object or tug on the mother and1 point to the juice in the refrigerator, that child is2 essentially using gesture to communicate3 pragmatically.4 So, I think it is very realistic to make the 5 argument that if you have a child who progresses to a6 stage where they are using pragmatic language in that7 way to get their needs met, and then they lose that8 ability, that's also losing language in the sense of9 pragmatic language even if it's not implying that they10 lose actual words.11 So, any mother will tell you that their 12 babies can communicate with them in ways that do not13 involve words, and I think it would be a significant14 disservice to the children whose cases will come15 before this Court if we are led down a path that16 falsely uses standardized word counts as the only way17 of assessing whether or not children are losing their18 ability to communicate.19 Q And that's in just one domain. There is, 20 again, a lot of focus on word count in just that one21 domain.22 Following up on the questions about 23 regressive autism and in these cases, are there social24 interaction skills that you observed in these two boys25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 198 of 2391653 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888that they had and then lost?1 A And to say that I observed it in the boys, 2 it would be by virtue of video tape as I have -- you3 know, as we've established, have not met the children. 4 But I did see very age-appropriate expressions of5 social interaction in both of the boys early on, and6 the most striking thing was that they both early on7 exhibited a lot of looking directly at the camera, and8 a lot of being responsive with their faces lighting up9 with different events going on around them.10 In both of them, I appreciated a qualitative 11 change in their demeanor. Again, at the time I kept12 myself blinded as to the supposed onset of the13 regression, but you could see the qualitative change14 in their faces as they looked past people instead of15 engaging with them, or they withdrew from social16 interaction whereas previously they had sought it out.17 So, I think there is clear evidence of 18 impairments in those domains and a loss of previous19 skills.20 Q And you just used the word \"qualitative 21 assessment\" when you were describing some of those22 skills. Flipping back again into the communications23 domain.24 A Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 199 of 2391654 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Would it be as fair within that domain to 1 say that that is a qualitative assessment rather than2 a raw quantitative assessment based on word count?3 A Exactly, because I'm very interested in how 4 the kids used the words, and sometimes if you have5 very rote, repetitive use of words, which we call6 echolalia, that is actually a very bad sign, and one7 of the signs that's recognized for autistic behaviors.8 So, we're not just looking at a list of 9 words. A good example would be a child who could say10 \"cat\", \"dog\" and \"pony\" would not be exhibiting as11 high a level of function qualitatively as one who12 could, as Jordan did, point to the cat on the13 wallpaper border and say \"meow\", or point to the dog14 and say \"ruff\". That's an example of the kinds of15 qualitative aspects of language and communication that16 I really hope that we evaluate as we go forward.17 Q And in these cases in particular then, would 18 it be your testimony that in the communication realm19 both of these boys acquired communication skills and20 then lost them at a later point in life?21 A That is my testimony. 22 Q Would it also be your testimony, to a 23 reasonable degree of medical certainty, that they24 acquired behavioral skills and lost them later in25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 200 of 2391655 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888life?1 A That is correct. 2 Q Would it be your further testimony, to a 3 reasonable degree of medical certainty, that they had4 social reciprocity skills that they lost later in5 life?6 A It would be my testimony, yes. 7 Q Would it also be your testimony that 8 combining all of those three discrete opinions that9 they were clear cases of regressive autism?10 A That is my best medical opinion, yes. 11 Q Now, I want to talk also about progress over 12 time now. If a child is one year old -- this is a13 little bit of a hypothetical. Say a child is one old.14 A Okay. 15 Q And maybe is at the low end of the normal 16 number of words, so that even if we're looking at a17 quantitative analysis there are three ways that child18 could go in the future. They could ether catch up to19 the norm.20 A Yes. 21 Q Actually, there are four ways. Make 22 progress but below the norm.23 A Right. 24 Q Plateau or lose what they have, correct? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 201 of 2391656 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Right, or did we talk about even doing 1 better than the normal? That's number five.2 Q You know, being gifted would be wonderful, 3 so let's include that as the fifth.4 A Okay. 5 Q So beginning at that starting off point, 6 there are five possible outcomes.7 A Right. 8 Q And how many of those outcomes would you 9 describe that child's progress as symptoms of10 regression?11 A Now I've totally lost you on the last part 12 of the question.13 Q Yes. Put it this way. Only one of those 14 outcomes would represent regressive autism, correct,15 that's that drop off?16 A Oh, yes. I'm sorry. Yes. 17 Q Okay. 18 A I am talking about dropping off the -- 19 actually, I'm talking about actually losing words that20 they had, so that is a clear dropping off, yes.21 Q Right. There were questions about single- 22 dose versus multi-dose vials this afternoon. Do you23 remember those questions?24 A Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 202 of 2391657 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And the question was posed to you as a fact 1 that single-dose vials do not contain thimerosal. Do2 you recall that statement?3 A I do recall that implication. 4 Q Do you believe that statement to be true? 5 A No. 6 Q Why don't you think it's true? 7 A Because there were no requirements that all 8 single-dose vials be thimerosal free. One of the9 advantages of having single-dose vials is that you10 typically are able to get by with less preservatives,11 but to my knowledge, there was no mandate in that12 regard.13 Q In fact, the only mandate is that multi-dose 14 vials must have a preservative, correct?15 A That's correct. 16 Q And single-dose vials could have a 17 preservative and it was not prohibited, correct?18 A To the best of my knowledge, that is 19 correct.20 Q There was also a series of questions about 21 other environmental exposures that might contribute to22 the emergence of autism, particularly regressive23 autism. Given other exposures that may be there, and24 let's not assume whether they are or not, but if they25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 203 of 2391658 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888are there what do you believe, if any, about the1 potential contribution of thimerosal-containing2 vaccines in the presence of those other possible3 exposures, in general?4 A In general, I am very concerned about the 5 concept of synergistic toxicities. This is the6 concept where any given substance has the potential to7 be more toxic if it's given in combination with other8 substances known to be toxic.9 So, the classic example is when you look at 10 the LD-50, for example, the lethal dose that would11 kill 50 percent of whatever you're studying for a12 single toxin and then another toxin, when they get13 those two things together, it just doesn't double14 their risk of dying. It frequently increases it by15 many orders of magnitude.16 So, one of my concerns, since we've polluted 17 our planet so much, is that children who might18 otherwise be exposed to lead toxicity or perhaps coal-19 burning power plants, or live next door to a20 agricultural farm that uses pesticides, and also gets21 thimerosal-containing vaccines, that that child would22 be subject to the possibility of synergistic23 toxicities. That's one of the reasons that I find it24 so difficult for any given child to come up with a25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 204 of 2391659 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888dose of ethyl mercury given by TCVs that is going to1 be safe for every kid because the synergistic2 toxicities are going to vary, depending upon whether3 the child is living in a lead-infested ghetto in the4 inner city, or whether it's the child of a farmer who5 is using organic pesticides, those types of issues.6 Q And generally with those kind of exposures 7 information is not available, including how much got8 into --9 A Right. 10 Q -- a person's body, correct? 11 A Right. 12 Q When it got in there. Exactly what the 13 chemical formulation was you often don't know that.14 A Right. 15 Q You don't know what dose entered the body. 16 A Right. 17 Q You don't know exactly where in the body the 18 dose might have gone.19 A Right. 20 Q Now, with thimerosal-containing vaccines, 21 there is better information on the exposure, isn't22 there?23 A Yes. 24 Q And where does that information come from? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 205 of 2391660 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A From the label on the vial or on the box. 1 Q So you know what the chemical of interest 2 is.3 A Right. 4 Q You know how much was there. 5 A Right. 6 Q You know the dose. 7 A Yeah. 8 Q You know when it was administered. 9 A Yeah. 10 Q You know the timing of the symptoms after it 11 was administered, correct, just in terms of somebody12 who then develops symptoms.13 A Yes. 14 Q If they got the shot in a day and the 15 symptoms later, you can tell if there whether there's16 a gap.17 A Yes. Yes. 18 Q And based on the peer-reviewed scientific 19 literature that's been discussed, you know something20 about the specific pharmacokinetics of the compound?21 A That's correct. 22 Q Knowing all of that as opposed to other 23 exposures, does that make it more likely, in your24 opinion, that thimerosal-containing vaccines can be25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 206 of 2391661 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888part of a differential diagnosis in the etiology of1 regressive autism?2 A Yes. That makes it quite clear that it 3 should be in my differential diagnosis.4 Q And that is also in review of Dr. Aposhian 5 and Dr. Deth and Dr. Kinsbourne's opinions, correct?6 A Yes. I very much rely on them to inform me 7 about matters of toxicology, neuroinflammation. I8 have to be able to rely on colleagues that I trust to9 educate me in those areas.10 Q And if we think of the mechanism of injury, 11 there were some questions about exposures and exposure12 levels. The exposure that one gets through the13 administration intra of a TCV --14 A Right. 15 Q -- in terms of the mechanism of injury is 16 that ultimately the exposure that's of interest to you17 and that informs your opinion?18 A Tell me that again, Tom. 19 Q Yes. The initial exposure and how much 20 is --21 A Oh, no, no. I'm not concerned about the 22 initial exposure or the initial blood levels. I'm23 concerned about what happens potentially a great deal24 of time later as this process that we've discussed25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 207 of 2391662 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888where ethyl mercury has entered the brain, converts to1 inorganic mercury, and then causes potentially to2 varying degrees disruption of cellular biochemistry,3 neurotransmitter function, interference with crucial4 neuronal signaling, those types of functional jobs5 that those cells are tasked to do.6 Q So just to explore the details then of your 7 opinion in these cases, what you know in these cases8 is that both boys were exposed to thimerosal-9 containing vaccines, correct?10 A Right. 11 Q And based on the review of the literature 12 and reliance on other experts, you have reached a13 conclusion about where that thimerosal breakdown14 product ends up, correct?15 A Correct. 16 Q And it triggers a process in the developing 17 brain, correct?18 A Correct. 19 Q What is that process that you believe, to a 20 reasonable degree of scientific certainty, is involved21 here?22 A Conversion to inorganic mercury and 23 neuroinflammation.24 Q And the neuroinflammation that's triggered, 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 208 of 2391663 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888is that consistent with the model describe by Dr. Deth1 again that you relied on in reaching your expert2 conclusions here?3 A Completely, in my opinion, yes. 4 Q Is it your belief, to a reasonable degree of 5 scientific certainty or probability, excuse me, that6 Dr. Kinsbourne's model of the overactivated brain7 resulting from neuroinflammation, do you believe8 that's what happened in Jordan King's case and in9 William Mead's case?10 A I do believe that that's what happened to 11 these children. I also believe that that Dr.12 Kinsbourne's model is consistent with what I see in my13 patients, and I think, in particular, one of the most14 egregious examples of that was the little boy I15 presented earlier today who had seizures for 18 years16 before he died several weeks ago.17 His clinical presentation is precisely what 18 I would expect to see in a child who had increased19 excitation and decreased inhibition. Throughout the20 time I took care of him, despite my best efforts, he21 was constantly in a state of anxiety. He had a lot of22 stimming behaviors, and as we mentioned, he had such23 severe seizures that we actually had to implant a24 vagus nerve stimulator in him to decrease the number25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 209 of 2391664 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888of seizures by 100 or so per day.1 And so as I've gone on this journey 2 everything that I've learned along the way has been3 evaluated in terms of my clinical experience, and I4 embrace those mechanisms, those scientific findings5 that I can in some logical way always tie back to what6 I'm seeing as a clinician because that is primarily7 what I am.8 Q And if you saw evidence that you thought 9 significant that would change your opinion in either10 Jordan King's case or William Mead's case, would you11 in fact change your opinion?12 A I would have to do that because I think I 13 have vowed to tell the truth and the whole truth, and14 I want to maintain my credibility because I'm going to15 be held accountable for my opinions.16 I may turn out to be wrong. One of the 17 things that believe me I've thought about is why am I18 up here when the WHO and the CDC and the AAP, and all19 those other organizations that were listed obviously20 disagree with my conclusions. So I may well be wrong,21 and would take it on the chin if that's the case, but22 so far as the science accumulates it seems like I am23 more right, and time will tell.24 Q You were also asked questions about whether 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 210 of 2391665 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888you could identify one key piece of evidence or one1 most important piece of evidence, you were asked2 essentially the same question but in several different3 ways.4 What do you think is the key evidence that 5 you rely on in support of your opinion in each of6 these cases? I mean, is there one lab result or is it7 something else?8 A You know, I really can't identify one lab 9 result. I wish it were that easy, believe me. It10 would make my job day to day -- you know, I could get11 home a lot earlier, but this is a tedious process of12 using a combination of clinical history, many labs13 together.14 I perhaps should take a chance for those of 15 you who are not clinicians to explain that we teach --16 we, ARI, teach that the child is the best lab. We use17 objective measures because we're trying to put a story18 together, but we have to look at labs in context.19 I am trying to think of a simple example, 20 but in addition to being differential diagnoses for21 disease states or symptoms, there are also22 differential diagnoses for laboratory values.23 So when you see an analyte that's high, you 24 should intellectually think about what potential25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 211 of 2391666 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888things that could be causing that analyte to be1 elevated. And if the same child has another analyte2 over here that also has a differential diagnosis, you3 should think about what things could cause that4 analyte to be elevated and on and on.5 So, as we look at our labs what we're trying 6 to do is to look at the thing that seems likely as the7 differential cause of that elevation in relationship8 to the other analytes so that if you just have one9 thing that might suggest metabolic acidosis or in this10 case mercury toxicity, you know, that's on your list11 of differential.12 But if you find other things that are 13 consistent with that, then you move that up to the top14 of the list, and it's a dynamic process. It also is15 informed by the state of the child at the time, and I16 don't know how to make that really simple. I really17 wish I did.18 Q And it sounds like certainly you can't do a 19 ranking like your top 10 things that you would be20 looking for, is that correct? Just in general, if21 you're looking at all of the things you would consider22 in a differential, you don't have some neat little23 checklist?24 A No. I have a checklist of, you know, labs 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 212 of 2391667 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888that we find to be informative in certain patients,1 and I don't order every lab in every patient because2 part of what happens in the history is to help you3 rule out the need for some labs based on the clinical4 story. But I don't have a top 10 list.5 Q And using the Respondent's words that they 6 used on cross-examination, key evidence, is it key7 evidence in both cases here that these boys, in your8 opinion, suffered a clear autistic regression?9 A Yes. 10 Q Is that key evidence? 11 A Yes. 12 Q Is it key evidence in these cases that both 13 of these boys received the full on-schedule TCV14 exposure?15 A Yes, with the caveat that I think that there 16 may be some children who by virtue of their state at17 the time of shots would not necessarily have to get18 the full complement in order to have a problem.19 Q Understood, but I really want to focus on 20 these two particular cases --21 A Okay. 22 Q -- and not in the more global. So the 23 question again would be, is it significant evidence to24 you that both Jordan and William received the full25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 213 of 2391668 DR. MUMPER - REDIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888complement of TCVs on the pediatric schedule?1 A Yes, that is key. 2 Q Is it significant evidence to you that you 3 have ruled out through the medical records and the4 videos and talking to the parents any family history5 of autism?6 A Yes. 7 Q Is it significant to you that neither one of 8 the siblings of Jordan or William exhibits any9 developmental problems, delays or symptoms?10 A Yes. 11 Q Is it key evidence to you that these boys 12 have been found to have no genetic aberrations that13 are typically associated with autism, autistic14 symptoms?15 A Yes. 16 Q Is it also key evidence that there is no 17 sign that either of these boys received exposures to18 other known causes of autism, such as terbutaline,19 valproic acid and other agents?20 A Yes. 21 Q So all of that is key evidence to you? 22 A Right, and a lot of what you've just 23 described is what I mean when I say evaluating the24 kids individually and taking the history.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 214 of 2391669 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And the history being an entire history that 1 we've just described?2 A Yes. Yes. 3 MR. POWERS: I have no further questions. 4 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Thank you. 5 Re-cross?6 RE-CROSS-EXAMINATION 7 BY MR. JOHNSON: 8 Q Doctor, you were asked some questions about 9 why you do the research that you do, and I believe why10 you employ a research director, and you mentioned that11 you did so because you believe it is the right thing12 to do, is that correct?13 A Yes, that is correct. 14 Q And remind me again, what is the name of 15 your clinic?16 A The Rimland Center. 17 Q Okay, and did you at one time have a clinic 18 called Advocates For Children?19 A Yes, I actually still have that. The 20 Rimland Center now has three different arms to it. 21 Advocates For Children is my typical pediatric22 practice where I see ear aches and sore throats and23 well babies.24 Advocates For Families is the part of the 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 215 of 2391670 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888practice where I see the children with autism or a few1 kids that have ADHD or other behavioral problems that2 are more of a consulting basis, and those tend to be3 the patients that have traveled from far away.4 Then the Rimland Center is kind of over 5 those two, and that is the center that was established6 to be a mentoring center.7 So, one of the things that we recognized at 8 ARI was that we wanted to provide some on-site9 training for physicians, and since I had the10 background and medical education for 11 years11 previously, designing curricula at the residency and12 teaching other doctors, and because I really loved to13 do that, I decided to start the Rimland Center so that14 we could invite clinicians.15 And I announced my intention to do it last 16 spring. I bought a building in June. I renovated it17 from July 27th to September 17th, and we opened on18 September 17th.19 Since then we have had a doctor from Italy 20 bring four to six patients over several times, and21 spend several weeks mentoring with me. We've had a22 clinician from Australia come, and we've had several23 people from around the country, and I'm excited about24 the fact that I'm getting requests by classically25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 216 of 2391671 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888trained developmental pediatricians to come and see1 what we do, you know, perhaps out of curiosity, but2 the tendency, or the feedback that we've gotten so far3 is that when you first look at what we're doing it4 might --5 Q Doctor, I'm sorry to interrupt. 6 A Sorry. 7 Q The question really was just do you have a 8 clinic called Advocates For Children.9 A Yes, I do. 10 Q Okay. Do you feel that you're an advocate 11 for autistic children?12 A Yes. 13 Q Because you administered thimerosal- 14 containing vaccines for a number of years as a15 pediatrician, do you feel complicit in the epidemic of16 autism?17 A Yes, I do. 18 Q And do you feel that you have a debt to 19 repay?20 A Yes, I do. 21 Q Doctor, you talked a little bit about your 22 role as deciding what literature to teach and that you23 do a thorough review of the literature in order to24 determine what literature to teach to the people in25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 217 of 2391672 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888your clinic, is that correct?1 A As thorough as I can given the limitations I 2 explained.3 Q Okay. And you had not seen the Jill James 4 CPOX article that I referenced on my cross-5 examination, is that correct?6 A Yes. Remind me when that came out. 7 Q I believe it was within the last year. 8 A I was thinking it was even newer than that, 9 but no, I had not seen that.10 Q And you had not seen the Berman article that 11 tried to replicate the Hornig study, correct?12 A That's correct. 13 Q Okay. And on the topic of the Berman 14 article, the purpose of that study was not to look for15 neuroinflammation, is that correct?16 A That's absolutely correct. 17 Q Okay. The purpose of that article was to 18 try to replicate the Hornig study, correct?19 A That's correct. 20 Q And the Berman study was not able to 21 replicate the Hornig study, is that your understanding22 of the article?23 A That is correct. 24 Q You were shown some testimony from the 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 218 of 2391673 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Blackwell case in which you testified that you were 1 offering the opinion that thimerosal is toxic to the2 immune system, and then you -- it wasn't in your3 testimony but you qualified here today that that would4 include the immune system and the brain. Do you5 remember that testimony?6 A That's correct. 7 Q You are not an immunologist, correct? 8 A That's correct. 9 Q And you're not a neuroimmunologist, correct? 10 A That's even more correct. 11 Q And you're not a neurologist? 12 A That also is true. 13 Q And you're not a neuropathologist? 14 A That also is true. 15 Q You were asked some question about the issue 16 of whether single-dose vials did or did not contain17 the thimerosal. Do you remember that testimony?18 A Yes. 19 Q Are you aware that certain manufacturers 20 included thimerosal in single-dose vials and certain21 manufacturers may not have?22 A I delegate that task in my office actually 23 to my nurses. They're instructed to order thimerosal-24 free vaccines. So I'm actually a very poor source of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 219 of 2391674 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888information about which manufacturers have thimerosal1 in versus out versus trace amounts.2 Q So that's an issue you just didn't look into 3 for the purposes of forming your opinions in this4 case, is that accurate?5 A I will say that when I saw the shot records, 6 I did in my mind make perhaps an unwarranted7 assumption that it had come from multi-dose vials.8 Q And in any event, the amount of thimerosal 9 really isn't particularly important to you, is that10 correct? You believe that a single thimerosal-11 containing vaccine could contribute to autism, is that12 correct?13 A I stated that as a hypothetical to 14 illustrate the issue of individual variability, but I15 would not characterize it as saying that the amount is16 not important to me. For me, the less the better.17 Q But even with less you would still in 18 certain cases be willing to render the opinion that a19 single thimerosal-containing vaccine contributed to a20 child's autism?21 A I don't know that I can support the idea 22 that the ones who supposedly only have trace amounts,23 I just don't know that science. I just don't know24 scientifically where we can draw that line.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 220 of 2391675 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888I partially base that opinion on children 1 who did not -- who came to my clinic who had not2 received thimerosal in their initial series of3 vaccines' got flu vaccine, and then the parents4 reported an autistic regression that was temporally5 seemingly related to that, but that is way far from6 being well studied.7 Q You were asked some questions about 8 synergistic toxicities. Do you remember those9 questions?10 A Yes. 11 Q And in your report, I believe, that the 12 article that you cite is the Schubert article, and13 this is Petitioner's Master List No. 520. Does that14 article look familiar?15 A Yes. 16 Q And am I correct that this article looked at 17 the combined effects of certain metals and actually18 determined that in some cases there was a protective19 effect when certain metals were combined, is that20 correct?21 A Absolutely. 22 Q And this paper did not look at the issue of 23 neuroinflammation as the result of the combined toxic24 effects of these substances, correct?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 221 of 2391676 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A That's correct. 1 Another paper that I did not list was 2 published by Boyd Haley that did look specifically at3 thimerosal and its combinations with testosterone,4 neomycin and aluminum, and perhaps I should have cited5 that as being more informative in hindsight.6 Q But you did not cite it, correct? 7 A But I did not, right. 8 Q And then you were asked a number of 9 questions about neuroinflammation and the adult money10 studies that Charleston did, and you were asked a11 series of questions about how those informed your12 opinion.13 A Right. 14 Q Now, again, your belief that 15 neuroinflammation is caused by inorganic mercury, that16 essentially came to you through Dr. Kinsbourne's17 report, is that correct?18 A The first part of that was that the adult 19 monkey study showed that, so I didn't see Dr.20 Kinsbourne's report until -- I don't know -- maybe two21 months ago or one month ago, and the time that I had22 the opportunity to talk to Dr. Burbacher was August23 2005, I think. So no, it did not come to me after24 reading Dr. Kinsbourne's report.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 222 of 2391677 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q However, the precise model that Dr. 1 Kinsbourne is describing came to you through his2 report. That was the first time you had seen that3 model, is that correct?4 A That's probably correct. We've talked a lot 5 at ARI about the issues that he raises with regard to6 glutamate toxicity, increased excitation and7 inhibition, and the result of reactive oxygen species8 as detailed by both him and Dr. Deth. But the way9 that he put it together for his report, and so in the10 sense that you're calling it a model, I agree with11 that model because it's consistent with what I believe12 to be true in my study of those same issues.13 Q We can call it a hypothesis and so that was 14 the first time you had seen that hypothesis?15 A As articulated by Dr. Kinsbourne, yes. 16 Q Right. And you were shown some testimony 17 from the Blackwell case in which you were describing 18 some effects that mercury might have in the brain, and19 you mentioned neurons and microglia and astrocytes. 20 You didn't describe the hypothesis that Dr. Kinsbourne21 has put forth when you testified in Blackwell , is that 22 correct?23 A That is correct. 24 Q Do you know what happened in the Blackwell 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 223 of 2391678 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888case? Do you know how that case has been resolved?1 A I know that what happened was is that the 2 expert witnesses participated in something that I3 think was called a Frye hearing or maybe a Daubert 4 hearing, and after that the Judge ruled that the case5 would not go forward; that he would not accept the6 expert testimony as we had put forth.7 Q We being the plaintiffs? 8 A Yes. 9 MR. JOHNSON: Thank you. That's all I have. 10 MR. POWERS: We have nothing further. 11 Rather than doing re-redirect, I don't think I have12 anything else for Dr. Mumper.13 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Thank you. 14 Any questions?15 I think this is it, and thank you very much, 16 Dr. Mumper.17 THE WITNESS: Thank you. 18 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: It appears 19 that, Mr. Powers, Petitioner's case-in-chief, you're20 ready to rest, at least with your witness testimony21 here?22 MR.

MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888plenty of work to still do on the case moving forward1 potentially as far as July. However, we do rest our2 case-in-chief at this point.3 MR. MATANOSKI: I just want to have 4 clarification of that. The moving forward to July is5 to take testimony of Dr. Clarkson and Dr. Magos.6 MR. POWERS: And a potential third test 7 case.8 MR. MATANOSKI: Oh, I understand. Fact- 9 specific, your case-in-chief in fact-specific test10 case is --11 MR. POWERS: And rebuttal. 12 MR. MATANOSKI: And rebuttal. I just want 13 to clarify that you weren't talking about continuing14 your case-in-chief in July.15 MR. POWERS: No, we are not -- 16 MR. MATANOSKI: On general causation. 17 MR. POWERS: We are not continuing our case- 18 in-chief on general causation into July. So I will19 just be very clear. In terms of moving forward, we20 mean that we have a third test case that will be21 identified and assigned to Special Master Vowell. We22 will present case-specific evidence in that third test23 case. We anticipate that rebuttal, since Respondent's24 case is going to be open at least until July on25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 225 of 2391680 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888general causation with Dr. Magos and Clarkson, that we1 will then have some rebuttal to do after that.2 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: That week? 3 MR. POWERS: I sure hope it's that week, but 4 I am just expecting, Special Master, in time, I'm just5 saying the sequence would be after Drs. Magos and6 Clarkson, which will be the conclusion of7 Respondent's --8 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: Let me make sure. I 9 understand what you're proposing. You're proposing10 that third week -- that week in July to have rebuttal11 evidence for Drs. Magos and Clarkson, or rebuttal12 evidence in general?13 MR. POWERS: Precisely. We are proposing 14 rebuttal evidence on general causation after the15 conclusion of their case. If there is any case-16 specific for Jordan King and William Mead, we would17 obviously have to put that on before we are done next18 week.19 MR. MATANOSKI: That's not my understanding 20 of how this was going to transpire. My understanding21 was the last two days of the third week were for22 rebuttal for the case-in-chief. The record was open23 concerning the testimony of two toxicologists, Dr.24 Clarkson and Magos, and we understood that if rebuttal25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 226 of 2391681 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888testimony was going to come in as to those two1 witnesses, it would come in thereafter.2 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: That was my 3 understanding as well.4 MR. POWERS: The big concern there is with 5 those two witnesses, given the subject of their expert6 report, we might then have to bring all of our general7 causation witnesses back. So if we have general8 causation witnesses coming back say late in the third9 week of this proceeding, and then have to bring them10 back again, in terms of efficiency and cost I don't11 know if that's the best approach.12 MR. MATANOSKI: To testify as to what? If 13 they are not a toxicologist, they would be unqualified14 to testify as to the matters that Dr. Clarkson and Dr.15 Magos will be testifying to.16 If Dr. Clarkson and Dr. Magos testify 17 outside of their area of expertise, it obviously is18 subject to being objected to by opposing counsel. So19 if they are testifying within their areas of20 expertise, then the rebuttal should be limited to that21 area of expertise.22 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: It is 23 difficult to understand, Mr. Powers, how you couldn't24 introduce rebuttal testimony to what we hear in these25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 227 of 2391682 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888three weeks at the conclusion of these three weeks for1 these witnesses.2 MR. POWERS: Yes, I think the issue is that 3 the idea that we would have to have -- I hate to have4 two people come back because what Dr. Clarkson and Dr.5 Magos actually talks about isn't purely the6 toxicology. I think Dr. Aposhian would be involved7 with both of those experts, but I think Dr. Kinsbourne8 would be too.9 So again, the Petitioners just don't -- I 10 mean, the Clarkson body of work and the11 neuroinflammation issues raised in his body of work12 are issues that clearly are central to Dr.13 Kinsbourne's opinion and testimony. So having14 potentially Dr. Aposhian and Dr. Kinsbourne come back15 next week, then, you know, we're closed on general16 causation, but then we hear something in Drs. Magos17 and Clarkson, and have to bring them both back again.18 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: That's an if. It's 19 probable that you may want to put on more rebuttal, is20 that what you're telling us.21 MR. POWERS: Oh, you mean even on this 22 round? Yes, it's probable.23 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: Exactly. 24 MR. POWERS: It is probable that we will 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 228 of 2391683 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888want to put on rebuttal.1 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: And it is possible 2 that you will have rebuttal have Dr. Clarkson and Dr.3 Magos testifies?4 MR. POWERS: That is true, and then the 5 issue again is just hearing the entire case, in order6 to offer rebuttal and offer rebuttal that's coherent,7 the need to hear the full case.8 MR. MATANOSKI: I have to object. Not only 9 is this new as far as the procedure, not within the10 understanding obviously of Respondent, and I believe11 from what I'm hearing now of the Court, but we are12 talking about toxicology, and I understand, and I'm in13 agreement that if Dr. Aposhian wants to come back and14 talk about toxicology, that's fine, and that would be15 fine rebuttal.16 I'm understanding from some comments now 17 that perhaps Dr. Kinsbourne would come back and talk18 about what? Toxicology? Because my whole line of19 questioning whenever, whenever I asked Dr. Kinsbourne20 about a matter that was toxicological, he said,21 \"Outside my area of expertise. I defer to the22 toxicologists,\" which would be Dr. Aposhian.23 I don't understand why there would be 24 rebuttal to Drs. Magos and Clarkson from a neurologist25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 229 of 2391684 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888who said, \"I have to defer to a toxicologist on1 toxicology matters.\" If Dr. Clarkson and Magos step2 outside their area of expertise, it's subject to3 objection.4 MR. POWERS: And just a substantive issue. 5 When one looks at these studies, one of them -- I6 mean, there are issues in the monkey studies, for7 example, particularly the adult monkey studies, that8 get into what regions of the brain certain9 toxicological events -- what regions of the brain, and10 whether that's significant or not, the types of cells11 that are involved. It's not pure toxicology. These12 papers really do deal with the intersection of13 pharmacokinetics and toxicology with brain function in14 terms of the inflammatory process, and where these15 processes occur, and we've heard lines of questions16 from Respondent directed to Dr. Kinsbourne that was17 apparently important enough to inquire what regions of18 the brain were affected.19 MR. MATANOSKI: And that was because Dr. 20 Kinsbourne seemed to be stepping outside of his area21 of expertise when he talks about monkey studies that22 have to do with the effect of mercury on the brains of23 monkeys. Nevertheless, and every time I ask him a24 question about that that was specific to toxicology,25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 230 of 2391685 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888he would defer.1 This entire theory of neuroinflammation was 2 sprung on Respondent three weeks before trial, and at3 this point for Petitioners to be asking for the4 opportunity to come back later and work this case up5 further because they don't have it ready for trial,6 they had ample opportunity if they want to explore7 this theory before now. They are trying to explore8 this theory through this trial. We've had nothing but9 new evidence for the first two days of trial. This10 has got to stop. This whole proceeding is just11 expanding and is just going to be endless at this12 point.13 They had a clear deadline of when they had 14 to file their expert reports. That came and went15 without hearing this theory. This theory was, again16 it came up after Respondent's reports came in. I17 think an assumption that can be made or an implication18 or inference that can come from that is that19 Petitioners put on one theory. They saw Respondent's20 response to it. They understood the problems with21 that theory, and there were many.22 And then they went out, as you heard from 23 Dr. Kinsbourne, and asked him for an opinion. After24 they had seen Respondent's case, they tried to come up25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 231 of 2391686 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888with a new theory because they knew that the theory1 they were presenting on was not sufficient to carry2 the burden, and then three weeks before trial, before3 trial we prepared for for six years, this is six years4 in coming, the Petitioners come up with this theory.5 I think this theory has no merit, and I 6 think you will see that. I would submit you already7 have seen that. However, there has to be an end to8 this record. There has to be an end to this9 proceeding. I know that this can come up in another10 case. We might see it again. I think it will be11 ended right now, this theory of neuroinflammation. I12 think there is nothing to it, and I believe that at13 the end of this trial you will believe that too.14 However, the notion that because we have two 15 toxicologists coming in, in July, that this is going16 to be an extension of time for the case-in-chief of17 the Petitioners has to be resisted. There is nothing18 that Drs. Clarkson and Magos can be talking about that19 Dr. Kinsbourne can address within an area of20 expertise, and vice-versa.21 To the extent Dr. Clarkson and Dr. Magos 22 venture out of their area of expertise, you are not23 going to be giving it any weight, obviously, and it's24 going to be objected to. I submit that when Dr.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 232 of 2391687 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Kinsbourne stepped outside his area of expertise and1 talked about toxicology, that should be given no2 weight too.3 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Let me ask a 4 particular question. Have you and counsel talked any5 further about the exact schedule for that week in July6 exactly when Dr. Magos and Dr. Clarkson are going to7 testify? We talked about generally the Thursday and8 Friday.9 MR. MATANOSKI: No, sir. 10 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Nothing further? 11 MR. MATANOSKI: No, sir. 12 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: So what exactly, I 13 want you to be as specific as possible, what are you14 specifically asking us to do or rule, Mr. Matanoski?15 MR. MATANOSKI: I'm asking you to stay on 16 the same procedural schedule that we had, which is17 that in that time frame Drs. Clarkson and Magos will18 come in. Rebuttal to that toxicological evidence will19 come in thereafter.20 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: So you are asking 21 us to limit any rebuttal that come in after Magos and22 Clarkson to only rebuttal of their testimony?23 MR. MATANOSKI: That's correct. 24 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: You're asking that 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 233 of 2391688 MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the Petitioners, if they have any rebuttal to the rest1 of the government's case, that they bring that in at2 the end of the third week of this trial?3 MR. MATANOSKI: That's correct, sir. 4 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Did you want to 5 respond?6 MR. POWERS: Yes. The same position that we 7 had taken before, which is that to do all the rebuttal8 at once and to do all the rebuttal at the end of Magos9 and Clarkson.10 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: So you're saying 11 right now you're going to foreswear any rebuttal week12 after next. You don't want to do any then. You want13 to save it all until after Magos and Clarkson?14 MR. POWERS: Again, we are not talking case- 15 in-chief. As I said from the outset, case-in-chief,16 we are done. I have already said that we are done. 17 I'm not proposing extending our case-in-chief except18 for the one individual test case. So it's not new19 evidence that we are proposing at any point in support20 of our case-in-chief. It's rebuttal, and rebuttal21 makes sense to have it come in after their entire22 case, just as Drs. Clarkson and Magos will be coming23 in now after the conclusion of our case so that we24 don't have to have the position where there is is --25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 234 of 2391689 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888bringing people back for split rebuttal.1 MR. MATANOSKI: Your Honor, again, this is a 2 change in the procedure, and it actually may have3 affected, because this late change in the procedure,4 whether we would even call those witnesses or not. We5 want to be at an end of this proceeding.6 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: That's a good 7 point. I mean, almost a year ago we agreed on these8 three weeks, and both sides knew it, and we were9 certainly hoping everything would be done during these10 three weeks. It was the government that needed to11 extend beyond these three weeks.12 MR. MATANOSKI: I understand. 13 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: I know it wasn't 14 your fault, and I don't recall that we ever15 specifically talked about this specific issue. I'm16 sure we are not going to rule on it this minute. I'm17 sure we'll be talking before we rule on what you're18 presenting to us now.19 MR. POWERS: Nothing further. You asked 20 what our position was and I'm hoping I --21 MR. MATANOSKI: In fact, sir, one other 22 thing that I should caveat as you rule on this or23 consider this, maybe this is a matter we will need to24 take up next week, whether Respondent's position about25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 235 of 2391690 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888whether the late filing, three weeks before trial, of1 an entirely new theory of the case may have been2 different had this been presented, this proposal by3 Petitioners' Steering Committee had been presented at4 the time, we may not have ever agreed to have this5 proceeding go on with this new theory thrust upon us6 three weeks before trial when we had been preparing7 for an entirely different case.8 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: I think what 9 we'll do is take this matter under advisement, to10 revisit it. We obviously need to confer, and we will11 take this matter under advisement, and we will return12 and have conversations with counsel again next week. 13 We can anticipate commencing on Monday with14 Respondent's case at 9 a.m., and I understand15 Respondent will keep us apprised if there is a16 schedule shift during one of the days next week so for17 those who are listening at home they can adjust their18 schedules accordingly, and that's possible midweek for19 Dr. Rust. Am I correct with that?20 MR. MATANOSKI: That's correct, ma'am. 21 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Thank you. 22 MR. POWERS: And aside from a potential 23 shift, not the day but the timing I understand on Dr.24 Rust's testimony Wednesday. At this point it's25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 236 of 2391691 DR. MUMPER - RECROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Petitioner's understanding that there are no other1 plan changes in the order of witnesses and the2 appearance schedule that has been shared with us3 already.4 MR. MATANOSKI: That's correct. 5 MR. POWERS: So that does leave, depending 6 on what you all decide, there are still the two -- the7 Thursday and Friday, if they, (a) are still available,8 for spillover, but whatever is available those days,9 if you direct us to, would be available for rebuttal.10 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Thank you. 11 And before we conclude, I do want to thank William12 Mead's mom for being here with us today, the last13 parent in one of the two cases. We appreciate, again,14 as I expressed to William Mead's dad earlier, we15 appreciate very much your willingness to go public16 with this case for the same of the omnibus autism17 proceeding.18 Dr. Mumper, you're excused. Thank you for 19 being very patient there.20 (Witness excused.) 21 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: I think that 22 with that we have concluded with a robust piece of23 business that we will address next week, and we are24 adjourned for the afternoon.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 119 Filed 10/23/08 Page 237 of 2391692 DR.
