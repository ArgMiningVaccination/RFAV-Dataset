She takes the view that drugs are good for the short-term but not the long-term health of her children. \"If one of my children has a temperature, I go for the Panadol, but if it comes back again and again I want to know why, and GPs don't usually have the time to look for causes - natural therapists do.\" Stephen is among the 50 per cent of Australians who regularly use alternative therapies, such as traditional Chinese medicine , herbal and nutritional medicine. She is part of a public wanting greater control of their own health and wellbeing through nutrition, lifestyle changes and supplements rather than pharmaceuticals. To address the desire for alternatives, the Australasian College of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine and its affiliates, the Australasian Integrative Medical Association and Graduate School of Integrative Medicine at Swinburne University of Technology in Victoria, train and support the growing number of medical practitioners undertaking postgraduate courses in areas as diverse as mind-body medicine and chelation therapy. AIMA's mission statement is \"to promote the integration of holistic and complementary medicine with current mainstream medical practice, in pursuit of a complete whole person care\". This statement highlights the difference between the integrative and orthodox approaches. If you go to a GP complaining of fatigue and insomnia, you may get a referral and a script for something to help you sleep, whereas an integrative doctor is likely to take a long history and recommend your participation in dietary and lifestyle interventions. The treatment requires much more patient participation and the emphasis is on prevention rather than cure. GP Dr Peter Lewis was interested in alternative medicine before he trained at medical school. He practised as a conventional doctor for some time before realising there were limitations to what he could offer patients, particularly those with chronic health problems. \"After you have been giving antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, antidepressants or anti something for a while, you start to realise you are not really doing anything for the patient except covering up,\" Lewis says. \"You can't really do that with a clear conscience and know you are offering what's best for the patient.\" In the 1990s, Lewis joined a practice with Dr Joachim Fluhrer on Sydney's northern beaches, offering integrative medicine and natural therapies under the one roof. Their practice has now become part of a chain of four integrative practices around Australia marketed under the umbrella brand YourHealth. Lewis agrees that both conventional and alternative medicine have strengths and weaknesses. \"The whole point of integrative medicine is you really are trying to offer the best of both worlds. If you have appendicitis or break your leg or whatever, of course you would not go to a homeopath for treatment but for many, many chronic health problems, conventional medicine doesn't offer much because conventional medicine treats mainly symptoms rather than getting to underlying cause.\" Much of the interest in integrative health is driven by patients who are increasingly well informed - due in large part to the internet - and looking for a consultative rather than an authoritative diagnostic experience. After years with chronic insomnia and fatigue, and little relief from drugs, Phillippa Stephen finally approached an integrative doctor for treatment and after two visits and a series of tests she was offered natural hormonal treatments that greatly improved her health. One key area of concern with consumers is the cost of integrative medicine. A patient will often have to pay a large fee for the initial consultation and most of the supplements are not included on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Added to this are the extra pathology tests which usually form part of the diagnostic process. All doctors have their activities monitored by the Health Insurance Commission, which looks at consultation times, numbers of consultations, tests ordered, referrals, etcetera, and sets a mean range which it deems acceptable for each. Because he orders more of \"certain specific tests\" than average, Lewis says he has been asked to explain himself by the commission. \"I spend more time with patients and see fewer patients and my pharmaceutical prescribing is very low and my referral to specialists is also very low. \"So my overall costs are much lower but they [the commission] will not make allowances for that. They pick on the one thing they see as being higher than average and they say, 'You either stop what you are doing or go outside Medicare.' At the end of the day, it is the patients who have to pay "}
