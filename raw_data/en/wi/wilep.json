Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, though uncommon, does occur. Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times. In some areas, streets may be poorly lit and deserted at night. Be vigilant and avoid walking alone after dark. Water activities While beaches are generally considered safe, don't leave your belongings unattended. Coastal waters can be dangerous. Drownings occur. - Exercise caution - Don't visit beaches or coastal areas during periods of severe weather warnings - Don't swim at beaches that link to/from rivers, as the water currents can be very strong - Don't dive into unknown water, where hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death - Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities, including flags at beaches, lakes and rivers The main warning flags used in Portugal are: - Green: calm waters, swimming allowed - Yellow: agitated waters, no swimming allowed - Red: dangerous waters, it is forbidden to swim or enter the water - Checkered black and white: life guard is temporarily off duty The maritime police have the authority to fine bathers who disobey the lifeguard's warning flags. In the fall and winter months, be careful when walking along beaches close to the water's edge because waves can be very unpredictable in size. Waves may come onto shore further than expected and with strong undertows. Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion. Falling rocks are a hazard and authorities can fine those who ignore warning signs. In marine areas, coral, jellyfish and other ocean life found along reefs can cut or sting if touched or stepped on. If you suffer an injury, seek medical assistance immediately. Road safety Exercise caution on country roads due to narrow streets, blind curves and corners, as well as hidden driveways. Poor lighting and wandering livestock also pose a hazard on some roads. Public transportation Taxis are equipped with meters, which may not be visible. To avoid complications, always ask the driver to turn on the meter. If the taxi doesn't have a meter or you are travelling outside the city, agree on a price before getting in the taxi. Air travel We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards. Entry and exit requirements Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination's entry or exit requirements. We have obtained the information on this page from the Portuguese authorities. It can, however, change at any time. Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng).

Health Relevant Travel Health Notices [Global Measles Notice](/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/504)- 31 August, 2023 [COVID-19 and International Travel](/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/513)- 31 August, 2023 This section contains information on possible health risks and restrictions regularly found or ongoing in the destination. Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations. Routine vaccines Be sure that your [routine vaccinations](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations.html), as per your [province or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/provincial-territorial-immunization-information.html), are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination. Some of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others. Pre-travel vaccines and medications You may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary. Hepatitis B [Hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b.html) is a disease of the liver spread through blood or other bodily fluids. Travellers who may be exposed (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) should get vaccinated. Measles [Measles](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles.html) is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air. Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles. Yellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements [Yellow fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html) is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito. Travellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection. Risk - There is no risk of yellow fever in this country. Country Entry Requirement* - Proof of vaccination is not required to enter this country. Recommendation - Vaccination is not recommended. * It is important to note that [country entry requirements](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/vaccination-requirements-and-recommendations-for-international-travellers-and-malaria-situation-per-country-2022-edition) may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest [diplomatic or consular office](http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?view=d) of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements. COVID-19 [Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) ](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html)is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air. It is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally. Before travelling, verify your destination's COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19. Influenza Seasonal [influenza](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) occurs worldwide. The flu season usually runs from November to April in the northern hemisphere, between April and October in the southern hemisphere and year round in the tropics. Influenza (flu) is caused by a virus spread from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Get the flu shot. Rabies In this destination, [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) may be present in some wildlife species, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal.
