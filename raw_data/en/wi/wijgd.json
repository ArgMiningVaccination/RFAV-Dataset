That's obvious by the number of Americans who depend on pharmacists to answer questions about natural medicines and supplements. Do supplements and natural remedies work? And if so, how safe are they, especially when paired with prescription medications or certain health conditions? Whether by personal choice or by recommendation from a healthcare provider, a majority of adults now use at least one natural supplement to replace or to complement prescription medications. Every day, new natural products are available as treatments for certain conditions. Pharmacists want to share authoritative, unbiased guidance about dietary supplements and homeopathic remedies with patients, yet they lack reliable sources that deliver the necessary knowledge and clinical expertise they need to do so. Access to this program is valid for 12 months from date of purchase. Courses must be completed before access expires. Get Started Already have an account?
