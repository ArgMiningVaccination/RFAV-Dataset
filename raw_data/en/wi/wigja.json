Here's the rundown on some of the benefits of bone broth, and how to follow a bone broth diet that will deliver those benefits in more ways than one. Benefits of Bone Broth Bone broth provides whole-food-based type II collagen, which gives it a unique nutrient profile unlike that of any other food. Bones and connective tissue contain the beneficial proteins collagen and gelatin, which are known for enhancing the appearance of skin. But a lesser known fact about collagen is that it also supports digestive health. Collagen also contains amino acids glucosamine, proline, and glycine, which promote joint health, while maintaining lean muscle mass. If you've ever seen a thick layer of gel formed on top of refrigerated bone broth, that's the collagen that has been released from the bones. (It's also a sign of a high-quality broth!) Bones and connective tissue are storehouses for essential amino acids and minerals \u2014 which are lacking in many diets today. Bone Broth is also a source of protein, collagen and gelatin. Simmering bones for an extended period of time is what gives bone broth its nutritional benefits, extracting the amino acids, minerals, and collagen. Get Your Free Bone Broth Cookbook 66 nourishing bone broth recipes for a healthier life What is the Bone Broth Diet? The bone broth diet is a 21-day plan that involves eating Paleo for five days and fasting for two. During the five days of eating Paleo, you drink anywhere from one to three cups of bone broth. On the fasting days, you have three to six cups of bone broth. It's basically the Paleo diet meets intermittent fasting, combined with an increased daily intake of bone broth. Many people find that following a Paleo diet, may supports gut health and weight loss. This is because the Paleo diet cuts out the foods that are most problematic \u2014 such as grains, refined sugar, and legumes \u2014 and replaces them with high-quality animal proteins and vegetables, as well as small amounts of fruits and healthy fats from nuts and seeds. The bone broth diet takes Paleo to the next level by adding in two days of intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting is a cornerstone of many popular diets today, such as the keto diet, the 5:2 diet, and the crescendo fasting method. Intermittent fasting has been shown to help burn fat more efficiently, promote metabolism, increase lean muscle mass, support energy levels, and sharpen mental focus.

Bone broth contains approximately 6 to 10 grams of protein per cup, which means fasting on the bone broth diet will still provide you with 18 to 32 grams of protein per day to fill you up. If this is your first time practicing intermittent fasting, there may be a small adjustment period as your body gets used to taking in fewer calories, but you shouldn't feel starved. When you do get hungry, have another cup of bone broth, herbal tea, and/or water. Do the Fasting Days Have to Be Consecutive or Can They Be Apart? You can pick any days you want for your bone broth fasting days. Just be sure to separate your two mini-fasting days with at least one or two non-fasting days. Is There a Difference Between Bone Broth and Regular Broth or Stock? Yes, there is a difference! On the simplest level, regular broth isn't simmered with bones for an extended period of time, so contains less of the collagen and gelatin that gives bone broth such incredible benefits. Most importantly, high quality bone broth is sourced from grass-fed or pasture-raised animals. Is There Anyone Who Shouldn't Follow the Bone Broth Diet? As with any dietary change, it's important to check with your doctor or licensed healthcare practitioner before jumping into the bone broth diet. The information provided is not a substitute for a face-to-face consultation with your physician, and should not be construed as individual medical advice.
