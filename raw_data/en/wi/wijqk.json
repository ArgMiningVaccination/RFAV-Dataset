This version shall be used for all doses of the vaccine for individuals ages 6 months and older. The bivalent version of the vaccine protects against the original and omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains of COVID-19. An individual is now considered \"fully vaccinated\" if they have received at least one dose of the bivalent vaccine that was first used starting August 31, 2022. For adults, there is no longer a COVID-19 vaccine primary series or booster. Most individuals are considered vaccinated after one dose of the bivalent vaccine. There are certain situations where additional doses of vaccine may be recommended, for example for individuals 65 years of age or older, and people with a weakened immune system. Individuals ages 65 and older, may get an additional dose of the bivalent vaccine at least four months following their first dose. Most individuals who are immunocompromised may get an additional dose 2 months after their first dose. Public Health recommends that those individuals should speak with their healthcare or vaccine provider for further recommendations. In addition, unvaccinated children ages 6 months to 5 years should still receive two or three doses of the bivalent vaccine, depending on whether they receive Pfizer or Moderna. The decision to use only the bivalent version of the vaccine is because the bivalent version is most effective against the current strain of the COVID-19 virus. Both Pfizer and Moderna are providing versions of the bivalent vaccine and you may receive either version regardless of any previous vaccinations. - COVID-19 Vaccinations - Counties Near You Other options for COVID-19 vaccinations: - Community First Pharmacy located in the Primary Health Solutions building at 300 Forest Ave. Dayton, OH 45405 - Individuals should call 513-454-1117 or register to schedule an appointment by visiting [www.community-first.org/pharmacy.](https://www.community-first.org/pharmacy) - Individuals should call 513-454-1117 or register to schedule an appointment by visiting - Community Health Centers of Greater Dayton (CHCGD) - Visit [https://www.communityhealthdayton.org/COVD-19-Updates.php](https://www.communityhealthdayton.org/COVD-19-Updates.php)to request an appointment - Our Central Scheduling staff will call to confirm the appointment and collect pre-visit information - For those without computer access, please call (937) 461-6869 - Visit - CVS Pharmacy - Dayton Children's - Vaccines 6 months up to 5 years Visit [https://www.childrensdayton.org/coronavirus-covid-19-information-hub/covid-19-vaccines/covid-19-vaccine-scheduling](https://www.childrensdayton.org/coronavirus-covid-19-information-hub/covid-19-vaccines/covid-19-vaccine-scheduling) - Vaccines 6 months up to 5 years - Discount Drug Mart - First Priority Urgent Care - Dr. Jenny Wariboko This email address is being protected from spambots.
