Stay connected by visiting the | | COVID-19 Update: September 8, 2021 Greetings VIMS Community, I'm writing with a two-part message to address COVID-19 policy on campus and some general updates. First the updates: Management of the pandemic continues to be quite good at VIMS, with very few reported cases. Thanks to Joe Martinez for his ongoing efforts to manage process, policy and information flow, and to all of you for working to keep our campus and community safe. You may have heard about a recent uptick in cases on main campus. Although the numbers have increased recently, it's important to know a few key details: To clarify a few policy issues for the VIMS campus: And finally, a friendly reminder that all of us have a responsibility - on and off campus - to keep each other safe and healthy. Thanks again for all that you are doing to help us successfully manage this pandemic. | | Important Message to the VIMS Community: January 19, 2021 Dear VIMS Community, | | SCHEV-Approved Reopening Plan: July 29, 2020 Dear VIMS Community, The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) has required that all higher education institutions in the Commonwealth submit a Reopening Plan for the fall semester, effective August 1 through December 31, 2020. Each plan was asked to address 26 specific areas for compliance ranging from physical distancing and face coverings to on-campus housing and dining services. Given that we are a non-residential campus, a number of the components were not applicable to VIMS. The VIMS reopening plan that we submitted to SCHEV was patterned after an earlier document titled Plans for Phased Expansion of Campus Operations that was released to the VIMS community on June 12. We have retained the same title and modified the date I am pleased to report that our reopening plan has been found by SCHEV to be compliant and has been shared with the Virginia Department of Health by SCHEV. Also, we recently met with and shared our reopening plan with the Three Rivers Health District which encompasses a geographic area that includes VIMS. I have John T. Wells | | Important Document on Phased Expansion: June 12, 2020 Dear VIMS Community, The VIMS Emergency Management Team under the able direction of Joe Martinez, together with the VIMS Leadership Team, have been working over the past several weeks on a \" Governor Northam announced yesterday that reopening higher education in Virginia for the fall semester will require that each institution deliver a plan to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia by July 6. We anticipate that I end by communicating the importance of protecting yourself and family, protecting your colleagues and neighbors, and more generally protecting VIMS in all of your day-to-day activities. Thank you for your continued cooperation and commitment to return to VIMS safely in due course. John T. Wells | | Planning Ahead at VIMS: June 5, 2020 Dear VIMS Community, The VIMS Leadership Team together with the VIMS Emergency Management Team (VIMSEMT) have been actively engaged in planning for a gradual and safe expansion of on-campus operations at VIMS in the coming weeks to months. The path forward will not be business as usual, and my reason for writing is to give you a brief outline of what you can expect to see in the plan when it is finalized in the next week or so. But first, I want to take this opportunity to review our current operating procedures and to provide you with a summary of actions that will be forthcoming from Richmond. The forthcoming VIMS plan for phased expansion of on-campus operations will follow President Rowe's principles for reopening the William & Mary campus. They are The VIMS plan will address the following: Finally, I end by communicating the importance of protecting yourself and family, protecting your colleagues and neighbors, and more generally protecting VIMS in all of your day-to-day activities. You have adapted to the immense challenges with distinction and creativity. Thank you for your individual and collective efforts. John T. Wells | | State-Level Updates: May 1, 2020 Dear VIMS Community, We continue to carefully track developments at the state level resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and I write to share two relatively new pieces of news. The first is that the General Assembly reconvened last week for a one-day \"veto session,\" during which the Governor's amendments to bills and his veto of any bills that passed during the regular session were voted on by the state House and Senate. Without going into detail, yet as expected, virtually all new funding from state general funds was unallocated by the General Assembly in response to a potential revenue shortfall. This includes higher education funding for faculty and staff salary actions, graduate financial aid, undergraduate student financial assistance as well as support for undergraduate enrollment growth. Institution-specific funding for a wide range of new initiatives in areas of education and research was also unallocated, including VIMS new funding for our fish surveys and aquatic diseases. The General Assembly is expected to reconvene in mid-to-late August when more information is available on the state's economy and from updated revenue forecasts. It is not clear if there is a possibility that any of the unallocated general funds can be restored, nor is it clear whether or not anticipated budget reductions will be significant. Therefore, it is vitally important to be conservative in spending. The Leadership Team at VIMS receives weekly spending reports and scrutinizes them carefully. The second piece of news is that the Governor has put forward a blueprint for easing public health restrictions. The next phase, Phase I, has specific requirements for moving forward, and includes a glimpse of what Phase I will look like: I thank you for continuing to keep VIMS viable and as vibrant as possible in this unprecedented period in our 80-year history. As always, the VIMS Leadership Team welcomes your suggestions and expressions of concern (please send directly to Libby MacDonald at < John T. Wells | | Important Message re Temporary Closure of CBH: April 3, 2020 Dear VIMS Community, I write this morning to clarify that at this time there have not been any confirmed cases of COVID-19 among VIMS faculty, staff or students. The temporary closure of part of CBH was implemented following best practices and out of an abundance of caution. This action is the same as that taken at W&M under similar circumstances. VIMS is closed to the public but is open for conducting critical research, and employees are allowed on campus to pick up computers or other materials. Some staff who cannot readily or effectively telework may also be on campus. We have been working with W&M to develop guidelines defining critical research and are optimistic that they will agree to our recommendations. We do not yet have a timeline for that decision. In the meantime, we are limiting research activities, and faculty were notified of this on Tuesday by Mark Luckenbach. I have pasted below the relevant part of that message so that staff and students will also be informed of where we stand now. If you have any of the following that must get done within the next couple of days, and can do so while strictly adhering to the distancing requirement, you may do so. I also take this opportunity to reiterate that technical staff and students are not required to work in labs or in the field if they do not feel safe doing so. Many accommodations can, and have been, implemented to create safe working conditions but, even so, there may be those who remain concerned. Students who are not comfortable with working arrangements should communicate directly with Linda Schaffner, research staff should communicate with Mark Luckenbach, and operations staff with Joe Martinez. They will speak with supervisors to obtain their input. I am in direct communication with Linda, Mark and Joe many times each day and will ensure that we update our policies and protocols as needed during this difficult and uncertain time. I end by saying that our operations staff have done a truly superb job of maintaining our facilities and keeping VIMS functional, so please thank them for a job well done if you happen to cross paths at VIMS. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding. We will make every attempt to deliver consistent and timely messages to the VIMS community. John T. Wells | | VIMS COVID-19 Update 4: March 25, 2020 Dear VIMS community, As you are well aware, we continue to be threatened by the rapid spread of the coronavirus. The directive from the Governor on Monday regarding public schools and businesses was a poignant reminder of how serious the situation has become. The challenge and our response to it is very fluid, and our goal is to continue to bring you the most up-to-date information with as much clarity as we can and as soon as we have it. There are several new developments that I want to share. First, W&M will announce an online Town Hall for staff, probably to be held early next week. They are exploring how best to ensure that it is readily accessible to all who wish to join in. Likewise, we will plan an online VIMS Town Hall meeting in the near future for all faculty, staff, and students. Please stay tuned. Second, we are asking that all employees who can telework do so. W&M and VIMS recognize that not everyone can telework and that unless or until there is a full shutdown there will be people on campus. Keeping as many people off campus will help to ensure that the people who must work on campus can adhere to distancing and other safety guidelines. There is concern that employees who can telework may run out of work to do in an off-campus setting. I encourage you to provide considerable flexibility in teleworking by allowing your employees to engage in training, learning, and other appropriate activities whenever possible. Third, it is very likely that the pace of research will be further curtailed by the end of the week based on directives from the Governor or President Rowe. Dennis Manos, Vice Provost for Research and Graduate/Professional Studies at W&M, has been charged by the Provost with ensuring that only essential research is being done on campus and that it is being done strictly following CDC and VDH guidelines. Mark Luckenbach and I have been in direct communication with Dennis, and he is fully aware of our challenges in conducting research. Principal investigators should consider postponing research that is not time-sensitive and, as many of you are already doing, to work when possible in shifts to avoid close contact. I realize that postponing some of your research could have financial implications. We are in the process of exploring policies by various funding agencies and believe that there will be flexibility. We will communicate directly with investigators once we know more. Also, please ensure that members of your research team are comfortable with your respective work situations. You should direct specific research-related questions and concerns to Mark Luckenbach or me. Fourth, some of us are becoming overwhelmed with email. We encourage everyone to turn to our Finally, in an email from President Rowe last Thursday, she called on us to check in on each other; to give encouragement, advice, and support; and to work together to see our way through this extraordinary challenge. Thank you for your cooperation as we tighten restrictions on building access, and for your dedication and spirit as we move forward together as a true community. I call your attention to W&M's new virtual Wellness Center which has videos online for yoga, meditation, art therapy, and generally managing wellness during this stressful time. It's a great resource. Together we will get through this, and in the meantime will remain a strong institution with great employees and students, and with a great future. I hope you stay safe and well. More will follow. John T. Wells | | VIMS COVID-19 Update 3: March 16, 2020 Dear VIMS community, This brief message is to let you know that the VIMS Leadership Team and VIMS Emergency Management Team are in continuous communication with W&M regarding COVID-19. If you have not read the message from Sam Jones and Ginger Ambler at approximately 9:30 this morning, please read it. The situation is very fluid and our current plans for continuity of operations could change quickly. Two important updates that I want to pass along to you are: Thank you for your understanding and flexibility during this difficult time. I will update you if things change and in the meantime I wish you all well. John T. Wells | | VIMS COVID-19 Update 2: March 12, 2020 Dear VIMS Community, I trust that you read the message yesterday at approximately 5:00 p.m. from President Rowe and the message from Sam Jones at 11:00 a.m. today. If not, please read them. As the President mentioned we are in wholly new territory and should expect real sacrifices and unexpected challenges. The VIMS administration has received many questions and I respond below to this fluid situation as it applies to VIMS. A key goal in the President's message is to maintain the university's research and other operations. VIMS remains open and we intend to continue normal operations insofar as possible. I took part in email conversations yesterday prior to the President's message that made it clear W&M understands the operations and structural differences between VIMS and main campus. In a meeting this morning with Provost Agouris, she confirmed that VIMS has delegated authority to use judgment in handling our research and advisory work. Having said that, there are still a number of modifications that need to be implemented. Events and Gatherings: Events and gatherings in VIMS facilities as well as off campus are suspended at least through April 3. Events include activities such as conferences, workshops, and participation on panels. Gatherings include social get-togethers, town-hall meetings, and other activities that include a large number of participants in a confined area. Small groups of individuals, for example lab meetings or ad-hoc gatherings, are acceptable provided they are essential to maintaining normal operations and there is an opportunity to join by Zoom. Social distancing is an important strategy and this is a good time to ensure that you are fluent in using Zoom. If you have any questions regarding events or gatherings, contact me for a decision. Students: Virtually all M.S. and Ph.D. students at VIMS are supported financially, most from grants and contracts. As such, our students are considered employees who will continue to be engaged in research and, in some cases, advisory services. I am currently involved in discussions at the university-level about graduate assistants, and things in this area are still evolving. For now, faculty who supervise students will still be able to meet with them in small groups (see above section). Travel: The President's message indicates that both domestic and international travel is suspended. This is a gray area for us. Travel to events is obviously not permissible. However, travel associated with research and advisory services is permissible provided it is essential to maintaining normal operations, does not involve public transportation, and can be considered within commuting distance (e.g. Richmond, Norfolk, and potentially beyond if, again, it is essential to operations of your lab or more broadly to VIMS). Travel within commuting distance is not permissible if it is for the purpose of joining a large meeting of, say, agency personnel in Richmond. If you have previously scheduled travel, see the Vessels: VIMS will continue to operate its fleet of research vessels. This includes large vessels, the R/V Virginia, and vessels that may need to be trailered to off-campus locations for launching. If vessel crew members are unable to report for work, then vessel operations will cease. Telework: W&M is in active discussions about telework policies with regard to COVID-19. I do not have a timeframe for this to be communicated but once we know more we will pass the information along. We are all trying to navigate this difficult situation as best as we can. Things will go wrong; there will be bumps and uncertainty; and, I ask that you assume positive intent in how we are moving forward. More will be forthcoming, probably early next week, after a joint VIMS Emergency Management Team/VIMS Leadership Team meeting late tomorrow afternoon. Finally, if you are sick, please do not come to work. John T. Wells | | VIMS COVID-19 Update 1: March 10, 2020 Dear VIMS community, I indicated in yesterday's VIMS Digest that I would follow up today with more information regarding our plans for continuity of operations since the coronavirus has now made its way to Virginia (currently in northern Virginia only). First, let me assure you that we are working to maximize wellness on our campus, and paying close attention to CDC recommendations. Our precautionary actions include (1) increased attention to high traffic public areas by disinfecting hard surfaces such as door hardware, handrails, switches and other controls, and watercoolers; (2) installation of stands that provide hand sanitizers in high traffic building entrances that include Watermen's Hall Lobby, Davis Hall lobby, CBH lobby, Andrews second floor hallway, Fisheries Science Laboratory at the Fort parking lot entrance, Facilities Management lobby, and other locations to be determined as we are able to obtain more sanitizer stands; and, (3) availability of disinfectant wipes in classroom and meeting rooms for wiping down frequently used surfaces. Second, ITNS is taking steps to ensure that faculty, staff and students are able to connect remotely to office computers via Remote Desktop should the need to work remotely arise. You can visit Third, Linda Schaffner is working with our department chairs, ITNS and faculty in planning how to continue to meet the instructional needs of our students should there be a disruption in workforce. There is a range of options for alternate methods of course delivery that include (1) self-study contingency plans, (2) use of recorded lectures from a previous year, (3) back up instructors, and (4) remote delivery through Zoom or Panopto. These plans will be finalized in the next day or two. Fourth, should there be a campus closure we will need to maintain research animals and live cultures. We are thus developing a database for this kind of critical research activity and ask that all investigators complete the attached form and send to Mark Luckenbach by March 16. This must be done even if you do not have critical research that must be maintained should there be a closure. Finally, we will make timely decisions should events need to be canceled. The VIMS Leadership Team and Emergency Management Team will continue to meet at least weekly, and you can expect further updates from Sam Jones, W&M Emergency Management Team chair. You can also obtain the most up-to-date information at John T. Wells VIMS-Specific Messaging COO/COVID Director Joe Martinez | | COVID Update: August 9, 2022 Dear VIMS Community, You probably have seen the recent email from W&M COO Amy Sebring regarding COVID-19 Campus Plan Updates. In short, the University is moving forward under the consideration that COVID is one of the many illnesses our community manage on a daily basis. Reporting positive cases or close contacts is no longer required. Despite these revised protocols, COVID still exists amongst our campus community, and within the County and Region. We must remember to remain diligent and aware of our surroundings. With positivity rates continuing to be high in our region, contacting COVID is still a good possibility even though symptoms may be mild among the vaccinated. That said, Following these simple steps will continue to keep our campus community safe and minimize the number of positive cases; I have said before how proud I am on how the overall VIMS community has responded to the COVID pandemic in the past two years. We had our share of cases, though minimal, while continuing to operate in performing our research, education, and advisory service activities with little to no impact. These successes was because of a complete team effort by the VIMS community. Now moving forward we must remain diligent and flexible. We will continue to partner with W&M and the Public Health Advisory Team in adapting operations if conditions require changes. I am happy to answer any questions. Joe | | Updates on COVID-19 protocols (VIMS): January 20, 2022 VIMS community, Earlier this week, W&M COO Amy Sebring issued Given the message below, I wanted to highlight and clarify some items: Im happy to answer any questions. Stay well, | | COVID update: January 12, 2022 VIMS Community, As we return to campus, new COVID cases continue to be on an accelerated rise due to the Omicron variant. With 700K new cases per day across the country, Omicron makes up 95% of the new cases. In Virginia, Omnicron was first reported in early December and is now the second leading variant of new cases and shortly will be the leader. Virginia has a 7-day average of daily new cases reported of over 17K with 57k new cases reported just yesterday. Here at VIMS we have also been impacted. We saw a 40% increase of new cases in the month of December and to date another 10% increase in January. The good news is that the VIMS campus, to my knowledge, has not had any community spread and all of our positive cases have resulted from contracting the virus off campus. Close contacts to VIMS faculty, staff, and students have been minimal. We should all be reminded of the Healthy Together commitment we share and to be diligent both on and off campus. That being said, I want to provide the following information to questions I have received: I am happy to answer any questions that you have or address any topic not mentioned above. | | Announcing COVID-19 Booster Requirement and Updated Q&I Guidelines: January 3, 2022 VIMS Community, | | Vaccine Booster Shots: October 26, 2021 VIMS Community, Several of you have reached out to me stating that you have received your vaccine booster shot and what should be done with that information. I have confirmed that the Kallaco portal has been updated to accept booster shot information. W&M is requesting all faculty, staff, and students to update their Kallaco portal with their booster information when available. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks | | Weekly Mandatory Testing: August 20, 2021 VIMS Community, I have heard from several of you that you did not receive an email reminder from Healthy Together this week regarding your mandatory weekly testing requirement. Even though I was informed that a weekly email would be distributed to all of the faculty, staff, and students that are required to test, I'm afraid system glitches may and can occur. The responsibility to test falls on those individuals who are required to test. Anyone who is not fully vaccinated or has received an approved medical or religious exemption are required to test weekly. William & Mary has set up a self-service process to receive and take the test. Though I have not seen it, I heard and understand that a vending machine has been installed in the Sadler Center filled with the self-administered testing kits. By swiping your W&M ID card, a test will be disbursed. You can then complete the test and go mail it in the W&M post office also located in the Sadler Center. W&M has instituted this process to allow the flexibility for those individuals needing to test. You can go on your own as your schedule permits. So regardless of whether you receive an email reminder, if you know that you should test, then go to Sadler and take your test. I am still working with W&M to see if a test kit vending machine can be available at VIMS, more to come on this. | | Masking Policy for the Start of the Semster: August 9, 2021 VIMS Community, The Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks | | Update: COVID-19 Vaccines Required for Fall: August 2, 2021 VIMS Community, Joe Martinez As of July 29, 2021, the university is requiring vaccination for all students, faculty, and staff unless an express exemption applies. Updated COVID-19 vaccine requirements for W&M as of July 29, 2021 Employees verified fully vaccinated: 2,241 (75%) At VIMS we are tracking to about 80% Employees who do not record their vaccination or exemption will be placed on leave without pay and employment may be terminated. | | COVID Updates: July 12, 2021 VIMS Community, Travel Reinstated to Pre-Pandemic Travel Policy Return to Work Policy Phase II - June 6-July 15, 2021: campus open for employees / remote learning / phased opening to public Campus will be open for employees as needed and as appropriate to your work. You are welcome to use your offices! Phase III - July 16-September 1, 2021: begin to return to in-person Functional units that have been working fully or predominantly in a remote format will begin to return in person. Phase IV - Fall Semester 2021: Predominantly in-person / Decisions on functional work modes overseen by Cabinet members. We expect faculty to be on campus during the academic year and most courses will be offered in person or in a hybrid format. Phase V: Spring Semester 2022. In person, with adaptations determined by Cabinet Recognizing that our understanding of how different modes of work best meet our institutional mission, we ask Cabinet members (VIMS Dean/Director) to develop and communicate their longer-term understanding to the president and their units or schools by January 15, 2022. Masks Vaccine Requirements and Prevalence Testing Requirements If You Are Fully Vaccinated You will not be contacted for weekly testing if you have submitted documentation of vaccination. If You Are Not Yet Fully Vaccinated William & Mary will contact you weekly with the time and location for your COVID-19 test. As noted, COVID-19 testing for unvaccinated employees remains an essential tool in reducing spread of the virus on campus. Therefore, if you do not complete your testing as required, you will be placed on leave without pay until the testing requirement has been completed. Employees who are out sick, have a work schedule conflict or on approved leave during their scheduled testing will be rescheduled. The employee will need to send an email to [[healthytogether]] claiming their reason to reschedule the testing appointment.

Thanks, | | Positive Test, VIMS Protocols: September 14, 2020 Dear VIMS community, As we approach the end of the 2nd week of prevalence testing and begin the 2nd round of required student testing, I am happy to report that we continue to have no positive cases of COVID on our campus. This recognition and result is because of each of you, your commitment to a shared responsibility mentality, continuing to telework where possible in order to keep the campus density population to a minimum, and following the protocols of the approved VIMS Phased Expansion of Campus Operations plan. I also wanted to further remind you all of the procedure to self-identify and notify the VIMS EMT in the event of a positive test result. You must still follow the VIMS protocol in addition to the instructions in the University's message below. Our plan reads as follows: Here are some general ground rules: The above protocols have been exercised and has work well to date. Thank you for your cooperation, keep up the good work, stay well, and have a great weekend. Joe Martinez, Chair, VIMS EM | | COVID Update: August 11, 2020 Dear VIMS Community, As we approach the beginning of the fall semester and phased expansion of on-campus operations, I write to provide several updates and to reiterate important information that has been previously conveyed to you. Please read this and send questions and concerns directly to me. Joe Martinez, Chair, VIMS EMT Committee Wearing Face Masks Wearing face masks is paramount in the success of containing and not spreading the coronavirus on our campus. Recently there have been reports that VIMSers are violating our mask policy that was conveyed in the Revised Phased Expansion Plan (dated July 22nd) Dr. Wells sent out the revised VIMS expansion plan more than a week ago. You can find the collapsible version and other pertinent information W&M Healthy Community Commitment All members of the W&M and VIMS campus community will be asked to affirm their commitment to shared actions to mitigate risk of spreading COVID-19, to show care and concern for others, and, thereby, to support the university's ability to succeed during these most challenging of times. Affirmation of the Healthy Together Community Commitment is required for anyone who will be living, learning, and working on campus this fall. Students will have an opportunity to review and affirm the Healthy Together Community Commitment through the Personal Information Questionnaire. Employees will receive a copy of the Healthy Together Community Commitment along with their PPE kits, and they will be asked to affirm the commitment as part of the required on-line COVID-19 training that will be made available by Human Resources via Cornerstone. Technology Apps W&M's tool, called COVID Testing for Students and Employees On August 7th, Sam Jones sent an email titled: Required COVID-19 Testing for Employees. VIMS will be part of and participate in this testing program. The testing program consists of To date and specific to VIMS, VIMS students are scheduled to receive their tests and should return them immediately. To my knowledge, no employee was contacted to be tested prior to returning to campus. Once the semester begins, W&M will be engaging in ongoing (prevalence) testing that allows W&M (incl. VIMS) to see trends of COVID-19 within the community. These tests consider cross-samples of both students (@ 5% population) and employees (@ 2% population) to understand the extent to which we are seeing positive cases, or trends, of COVID-19. To facilitate our testing program, William & Mary (incl. VIMS) through its agreement with VCU Health System has partnered with Kallaco, a national lab network, for integrated testing. The Kallaco platform provides a quick, centralized way to check test results. To prepare for the faculty and staff testing process, all faculty and staff members If you are identified as an employee who must complete a COVID-19 test either in conjunction with the return to campus or as part of the prevalence testing, you will be notified by your supervisor and advised to contact the VCU Health Center in Williamsburg. You will not be expected to quarantine based on your participation in the required testing, although you will be expected to isolate if you develop symptoms or test positive. Required tests will be conducted at the VCU Health System clinic at 332 N. Henry Street in Williamsburg and shared with the university. This allows the university to respond quickly to any positive test result. As a reminder, you must report to your supervisor if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 through your health care provider or other testing programs. COVID Testing for Vessel Users VIMS Leadership has recently approved updated COVID Policies and Procedures for the larger VIMS vessels which include the RV's Tidewater, Bay Eagle, and Virginia. PPE Update Abrahamson House The Abrahamson House on the VIMS campus may be used under certain stipulations as listed below. HVAC modification Facilities Management has adjusted building HVAC systems wherever possible, increasing the amount of outside air being introduced into the buildings. FM has also increased the level and/or frequency of replacement of air filtration as possible. At this time, all systems meet or exceed their applicable code requirements. We are following the guidance provided by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Condition Engineers (ASHRAE) and the CDC, and we are working to implement the measures that are determined to be most beneficial to the Institutes faculty, staff, and students. Contractor/Vendor COVID Procedures VIMS and W&M have partnered to establish COVID procedures for contractor and vendors working on our campuses. | | Phased Expansion Follow-up: June 18, 2020 VIMS Community, On June 12th, Dr. Wells distributed We have also formatted the Plan (including References) for easy reference at This plan is now (since June 15th) in effect and will be until further communication is sent out. Our Plan's main relevance to the Governor's Phase Two expansion ( I would like to point out just a few important highlights of the plan: In addition, efforts are underway to post maximum occupancy limit signs for all classrooms, shared conferences rooms, elevators, and gathering spaces. In some cases these rooms have been rearranged to comply with social distancing requirements.

And for those new to ZOOM: SMS | | Approval required for student research during COVID-19: May 28, 2020 Dear all, I am sending this email to remind everyone again that my approval is required before a graduate student may participate in critical research or training. My original email on this matter, dated April 13, 2020, is below. An email, submitted anonymously through the W&M COVID-19 FAQS website earlier this week, suggested that faculty at VIMS are forcing students to continue work as normal and that I am taking a lax approach to protecting student health and interests. The individual represented themselves as a VIMS graduate student and urged main campus administration to step in to investigate how the situation is being handled at VIMS. For background, the VIMS critical research guidelines were developed in close coordination with, and the full support of, W&M's Vice Provost for Research & Graduate/Professional Studies, the top administrator for research activities at W&M and a member of President Rowe's cabinet. My addendum was designed to add an extra protective layer of review for students. When I determine that plans for student research or training go beyond \"will be working in the lab alone,\" this review step allows us to require modifications that will improve the plan. As with all of the planning and review going on during this challenging time, VIMS administration, VIMS EMT and department chairs and center directors are working together to address questions that don't have easy answers, and situations that require new solutions. Discussions with faculty advisors and students are important and integral parts of the process of tailoring solutions for individual student research and training scenarios. We can improve research safety for individuals and for the VIMS community overall, but only when we have the opportunity to engage. | | Addendum to Critical Research Guidelines: April 13, 2020 To VIMS faculty and students: This is an addendum to the Critical Research guidance memo Associate Dean of Research and Advisory Service Mark Luckenbach sent on April 5, 2020. Effective today, April 13, 2020: Continuation of graduate training that cannot be conducted at a later date and the initiation or continuation of experiments that are essential for meeting graduate student milestones must have the approval of the Associate Dean of Academic Studies. Approval is now also required for the initiation or continuation of field work for thesis or dissertation research. Requests should be sent directly to Linda Schaffner and should include a brief statement of the rationale for continuation of training or the initiation or continuation of experiments or field research, the names of students involved, and the inclusive dates for the activity. Linda Schaffner | | Academic Studies Update for Students: March 18, 2020 Dear VIMS Students, With the university's academic and business operations continuity plans evolving, we want to update you on our plans for day-to-day operations in the Office of Academic Studies. Your well-being and the well-being of our entire community is our greatest concern, and supporting you in these unusual circumstances is one of our highest priorities.

Linda, Jen, John and Cathy, Office of Academic Studies Miscellaneous | | Temporary Personnel Actions: June 16, 2020 Dear Colleagues, We write to you today as the leadership of the Faculty, Staff, and Professional Assemblies to ensure clear communication and transparency to each employee at William & Mary during this time of uncertainty. Earlier today, the Board of Visitors (BOV) President Rowe called Assembly leadership into these conversations in advance of this action and has committed to continue engaging with us throughout the year. We support the university having the tools to sustain our workforce to the extent possible and affirm the following principles that would guide action: As states open back up, it is important to remember that the full economic impact to higher education will not be fully realized until months from now. President Rowe and her Executive Leadership Team have committed to transparency as difficult decisions are made. We commit, as your elected representatives, to hear your voices and advocate for you, particularly in the coming year. We recognize you have received this message multiple times today, but we believe it's important in these uncertain times that you know your Assembly is working hard for you. Signed, Joe Wheeless, President | | Critical Research and Associated Risk: April 5, 2020 I appreciate the patience and cooperation that you have shown over the past few weeks as we have developed guidelines for how we can conduct our research under the changing pandemic conditions, especially under the Research activities not permitted on VIMS campuses, aboard our vessels, or in the field while we are under a stay-at-home directive include: This list of critical research activities expands the one provided by Dean and Director Wells in his April 3rd email to the VIMS community. The above is a list of attributes of critical research activities only, not a listing of which specific projects can go forward. If you have any questions about whether the work that you are proposing meets one or more of these criteria, [[luck, contact me to discuss your plans]]. All research activities must comply with the distancing requirements in the Governors order\u2014maintaining a minimum of 6 feet distance between people at all times. An unfortunate consequence of this distancing requirement is that research aboard our large vessels (R/V Virginia, R/V Bay Eagle and R/V Tidewater) have been suspended until June 10. Additionally, we expect everyone to develop plans that go above and beyond these requirements (e.g., isolating individual work stations where possible, adopting extra cleaning efforts, etc.). While we have managed to achieve a rather liberal definition of \"critical\" research that should enable us to sustain our research and keep most graduate students on track to meet their milestones, this is not a green light to resume most of our research activities. We must be driven first and foremost by safety concerns. I trust that you will all be extra vigilant about meeting distancing requirements and making your activities as safe as possible for yourself and others in your research group. As Dean and Director Wells communicated on April 3rd, \"technical staff and students are not required to work in labs or in the field if they do not feel safe doing so\" and if needed should contact the appropriate person in the VIMS administration to discuss their concerns. There is a very important additional issue that we must consider here. It is likely that additional people at VIMS will show some symptoms over the next couple of months that cause them to either to self-isolate or to be instructed by their physician to isolate. There is also a growing likelihood that someone at VIMS will test positive for COVID-19. Under those circumstances any building on campus could be subject to our Operational Protocol for Potential COVID-19 Contamination, which calls for closing potentially impacted spaces for a minimum of 72 hours before sending in an Advanced Cleaning Team. Should there be a positive test, the VA Health Department would become involved, contacting others with exposure to this person and directing them to self-quarantine for 14 days. As recently seen in Chesapeake Bay Hall, even a suspected case can shut down a whole floor of a building for several days, impacting other programs and potentially resulting in the complete loss of animals, cultures, experiments and samples. This can be a big challenge for us to manage because once it goes to a potential contamination situation you do not have any avenue to appeal for access. The potentially affected spaces are closed for several days. The likelihood of these closures increases with the number of people that are in our buildings, not just your laboratory. To manage this challenge effectively, we must absolutely minimize the number of people who are in our buildings, the amount of time that they are there, and the places that they go. We must all expand our thinking beyond just the risk-benefit calculation for our immediate research group and think about our colleagues and the campus as a whole. A faculty member, staff member, or student may say that she/he feels perfectly safe working in the lab, but if that person later exhibits symptoms or tests positive, then we must shut down all or a part of the building for others for several days. Given that individuals can spread the virus before becoming symptomatic, we all need to be mindful that we could unwittingly be a vector. I encourage you to look carefully at the list above and not simply ask, \"how much of my program can I keep active?\" but also the more critical question, \"what work can I possibly put on hold for the next couple of months?\" If we all take this seriously by minimizing the number of people that come to our campuses at any time, minimizing the places that those people go, and all of us minimizing our exposure in our daily lives, we can get through this safely and maintain a reasonable level of productivity. Mark Luckenbach | | Status of News & Media Services: March 23, 2020 Dear all, During the coronavirus closure, the News & Media Services office will be available to complete requests for routine services as follows: Media Services Sue Stein will be in the office 2 days a week for several hours to fulfill these requests. Otherwise, she will be working remotely from home. To promote social distancing, Sue will leave all completed work in the hallway outside of Suite 126 in Davis Hall so individuals can pick up their jobs at their convenience and not only when she is in the office. This week, Sue will be in the office on Monday from 1-5 pm, and on Thursday 10 am-3 pm. Please [[v|sstein,email her]] with your printing needs, new design requests, and other work that she routinely does for you. Sue will email you when completed work is ready to pick up. Cascade Web Management News & Social Media We wish you all well. David Malmquist, News & Media Director | | VIMS OSP Support: March 19, 2020 Dear VIMS community, In accordance with directives from President Katherine Rowe and Dean John Wells, members of the Office of Sponsored Programs are expected, to the greatest extent possible, to work remotely and practice social distancing. Until further notice, you can reach any of us during regular business hours (8:00 am - 5:00 pm) using the contact information below. Thank you for your understanding and flexibility during this difficult time. I wish you all well. Connie M. Motley, Director of Sponsored Programs | | Marine Science Day and Digital Outreach: March 19, 2020 Hello VIMS community As the situation with the COVID-19 outbreak continues to unfold and we all shift toward working from home and social distancing as our new normal, Advancement has been thinking differently about the modes of delivery for VIMS outreach programs. Not knowing when this outbreak may subside, we have canceled all in-person outreach programs on and off-campus through the end of May, and we are strengthening our digital outreach strategy overall through summer. I am writing to share what we have planned and to outline three ways to help. What's coming up:Marine Science Day will move to a set of curated, online experiences presented in a day-long, digital event format. This Marine Science Day will be filled with online resources, livestreams, and recorded videos of lab tours, demonstrations, and talks. We are excited about the opportunities this creates for VIMS including: We are currently working on the plan for Marine Science Day and will be providing more information soon. Over the next few weeks, Candice Vinson and I we will be reaching out to those of you that already signed up to host an exhibit or activity during MSD to talk about how we might present your information digitally. If you did not originally sign up to host an activity during MSD, but would now like to be involved in the digital format, please let us know. We are also beginning execution of a digital outreach strategy to carry us through the summer: How you can help: As we are working remotely, if you have questions or ideas please email them to Candice or me and we can set up a zoom session to talk about them more in-depth. Thank you all and take care! We look forward to your creative input. Sally Brooks, Outreach Coordinator "}
