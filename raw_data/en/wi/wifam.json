PCOS and [endometriosis](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/endometriosis.html) are the two most common conditions that may cause fertility issues in women. The term polycystic\u2014or polyfollicular ovaries, refers to ovaries that contain 10 or more immature follicles with a maximum of 9mm diameter. With PCOS, these follicles fail to ovulate and get trapped inside the ovary. These follicles can then swell up with fluid or blood or harden outside the ovary causing fluid filled or chocolate colored blood filled cysts, which can often burst on the ovary causing excruciating pain before the menstrual cycle begins. With polycystic ovaries, ovulation fails to take place causing menstrual periods to be irregular or absent, which in turn affects fertility. PCOS SYNDROME includes several symptoms including hyper-androgenism (increased amount or high amount of male sex hormones). The source of the androgens can be the ovaries themselves or the adrenal cortex. The consecutive disturbance in follicular maturation is an important cause of unwanted fertility and absent menstruation. Some of the symptoms seen in women with PCOS include: Special consideration: PCOS may also increase risk of endometrial cancer as the endometrial tissue will not be shed in the absence of a period. Different hormonal and cellular regulatory disturbances cause PCOS. To summarize, the proper cooperation of hypothalamus, hypophysis, and ovaries or the so-called axis of reproduction is disturbed. The ovaries produce an excessively high amount of testosterone, a male hormone, which is normally produced in small quantities. Along with increased testosterone, high amounts of LH and FSH are produced as well, most likely due to high blood insulin levels and insulin sensitive ovaries. This causes an impairment of the follicle maturation, which in turn affects fertility and ovulation. The effects of these hormonal imbalances cause an absence of ovulation and irregular periods, obesity, insulin resistance or diabetic metabolism, and an irregular distribution of body fat (usually obesity or significant weight gain in the mid section), and thicker hair growth on different areas of the body such as the chin, around the nipples and abdomen. Once an assessment of your health issues is done, and if our naturopathic doctor suspects PCOS, you may be suggested to get some blood and saliva hormone tests to check your levels of various female and male hormones. Metabolic testing may also be suggested if insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome X is suspected. Our naturopath may also suggest for you to get an ultrasound done with your medical doctor to confirm the presence of cysts and also check the size of the cysts. There is no known cure for PCOS based on conventional medicine, so treatment is mostly based on management of symptoms. Depending on the severity of the symptoms and the size of the cysts, surgery may be suggested. Quite often drugs or the birth control pill to suppress production of hormones is suggested. Excess weight reduction to decrease elevated estrogen levels, along with metformin, a drug for diabetes, may also be recommended to help with the symptoms of insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. For women who want to get pregnant, ovulatory drugs may also be suggested along with laparoscopic surgery and fertility treatments / procedures such as IVF. Ovarian stimulation syndrome and an undesired multiple pregnancies are a risk in these therapies. The ovarian stimulation needs to be distinguished from an overstimulation syndrome. This rare but serious complication can vary in its manifestation - from mildly affecting the well-being to life-threatening consequences. Its unclear what causes the overstimulation syndrome but it involves a massive increase in blood vessel permeability. This leads to the formation of edemas (significant water retention), ascites, and pleural and pericardial effusions. Thickening of the blood and the risk of thromboembolic complications can also occur. Talk to your medical doctor if you have any concerns or have experienced any of these symptoms if you are taking fertility drugs.
