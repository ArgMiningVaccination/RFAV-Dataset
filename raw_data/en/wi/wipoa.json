This leaflet answers some common questions about INFANRIX-IPV. It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. All medicines and vaccines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of your child having INFANRIX-IPV against the benefits they expect it will have. If you have any concerns about your child receiving this vaccine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Keep this leaflet with the vaccine. You may need to read it again. What INFANRIX-IPV is used for INFANRIX-IPV is a vaccine used in infants from 6 weeks of age and over to prevent four diseases, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough) and poliomyelitis (polio). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases. Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are all serious life-threatening diseases caused by bacterial infection. Poliomyelitis is an infectious disease caused by viral infection. Diphtheria Diphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin. Generally the airways become inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation. The bacteria also release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and death. The risk of serious complications and death is greater in the very young and elderly. Tetanus (Lockjaw) Tetanus bacteria enter the body through wounded skin. Wounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse manure or wood splinters. The bacteria release a toxin (poison), which can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and death. The spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. The death rate is 30-40% of cases. Pertussis (Whooping cough) Pertussis is a highly infectious illness. The disease affects the breathing tract causing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing. The coughing is often accompanied by a 'whooping' sound. The cough may last for 1-2 months or longer. Pertussis can also cause inner ear infections, long-lasting bronchitis, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and death. The risk of severe complications and death is greatest in infants under 6 months of age. The death rate is 0.5% for infants under 6 months of age. Poliomyelitis (Polio) Polio is a viral infection that can have variable effects. Often it causes only a mild illness but in some people it causes permanent injury or death. In its severest form, polio infection causes paralysis of the muscles, including those needed for breathing and walking. Polio infection can leave a person unable to breathe without the help of an iron lung machine, unable to walk without leg braces, or confined to a wheel chair. The limbs affected by the disease may be painfully deformed. Vaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. INFANRIX-IPV cannot give your child diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or polio infection. The vaccine will not protect against diseases caused by other types of bacteria, viruses or organisms. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason. This vaccine is available only with a doctor's prescription. There is not enough information to recommend the use of this medicine for children under the age of 6 weeks. Before your child is given INFANRIX-IPV When your child must not be given it Do not have INFANRIX-IPV if: - your child has had an allergic reaction: - to INFANRIX-IPV, or any ingredient contained in this vaccine. The ingredients in INFANRIX-IPV are listed at the end of this leaflet - to any other vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or inactivated polio (such as Infanrix, Triple Antigen, Tripacel or Ipol vaccine) Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include: - shortness of breath - wheezing or difficulty breathing - swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body - rash, itching or hives on the skin - your child experienced a disease of the brain within 7 days after previous vaccination with a pertussis containing vaccine. INFANRIX-IPV should not be given after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal. If you are not sure whether your child should have INFANRIX-IPV, talk to your doctor or nurse. Before your child is given INFANRIX-IPV Tell your doctor if your child has any of the following medical problems: - after having INFANRIX-IPV or another pertussis-containing vaccine (such as Infanrix or Triple Antigen) your child had any problems, especially: - a high temperature (40.0\u00b0C) within 2 days of vaccination - a collapse or shock-like state within 2 days of vaccination - crying lasting 3 hours or more within 2 days of vaccination - convulsions (seizures/fits) with or without a fever within 3 days of vaccination - brain disease or central nervous system (CNS) disease (ie. epilepsy etc.) - a tendency to febrile convulsions (seizures/fits due to a fever or high body temperature) - a family history of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) - your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor or nurse about this before vaccination - a bleeding problem or bruises easily - allergy to the antibiotics neomycin sulfate and polymyxin sulfate. - lowered immunity due to medical treatment or a medical condition - your child has breathing difficulties. This may be more common in the first three days following vaccination if your child is born prematurely (before or at 28 weeks of pregnancy) - your child fainted with a previous injection. Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Tell your doctor if your child has allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes. If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell him/her before your child is given INFANRIX-IPV. Taking other medicines Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if your child is taking any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid when your child is given INFANRIX-IPV. Having other vaccines Tell your doctor or nurse if your child has received another vaccine recently. Some vaccines may be affected by other vaccines. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will be able to tell you what to do if INFANRIX-IPV is to be given with another vaccine. How INFANRIX-IPV is given The doctor or nurse will give INFANRIX-IPV as an injection. If you have any concerns about how this vaccine is to be given, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. How much is given The dose of INFANRIX-IPV is 0.5 mL. How it is given INFANRIX-IPV will be injected into the upper leg muscle in infants under 12 months of age. In children over 12 months of age the injection may be given in the upper arm muscle instead. Each dose of INFANRIX-IPV is for single use only. Any residual vaccine must be discarded. The vaccine should never be given intravenously. When it is given INFANRIX-IPV is usually given as a total of three doses as follows: - First dose: 2 months of age - Second dose: 4 months of age - Third dose: 6 months of age Each dose is given on a separate visit. INFANRIX-IPV should not be given at birth. It is also recommended that children up to 6 years of age receive a single booster (follow up) dose of INFANRIX-IPV. It is important to return at the recommended times for follow up doses. You should discuss with your doctor what is needed for your child. If a dose is missed If your child misses a scheduled dose, talk to your doctor or nurse and arrange another visit as soon as possible. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. While being given INFANRIX-IPV Things you must do Keep your child's follow up visits with the doctor or clinic. It is important the follow-up doses of INFANRIX-IPV are given at the correct times. This will ensure the best effect of the vaccine in protecting your child against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliovirus infection. Side effects Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist as soon as possible if your child does not feel well during or after having had INFANRIX-IPV. INFANRIX-IPV helps protect most children from diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliovirus infection, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few children. All medicines and vaccines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious; most of the time they are not. Some side effects may need medical attention. The chance of your child having a serious side effect is very much less than the chance of your child having a permanent injury from the natural infections. Do not be alarmed by the following lists of side effects. Your child may not experience any of them. Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have. Most unwanted effects with INFANRIX-IPV are mild and usually clear up within a few days. These effects, as with other vaccines, generally occur around the injection site. MILD EFFECTS Tell your doctor if your child has any of the following that are troublesome or ongoing: - pain, redness, swelling, a hard lump around the injection site - fever between 38\u00b0C and 39.5\u00b0C, generally feeling unwell, runny nose or loss of appetite - unusual crying (for more than 1 hour), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache - sleepiness, tiredness, nervousness, restlessness, fussiness or difficulty sleeping - skin rash, bruising, or purple or red-brown spots visible through the skin (purpura). MORE SERIOUS EFFECTS Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following: - fever greater than 39.5\u00b0C - crying for 3 hours or more - collapse, or periods of unconsciousness or lack of awareness - seizures (convulsions) or fits. Contact your doctor immediately or take your child to the casualty department of your nearest hospital if any of the following happens: - sudden sign of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of limbs, face, eyes, lips, mouth, throat or other part of the body - shortness of breath, breathing or swallowing difficulties - unusual tiredness or weakness that is sudden and severe. These are signs of an allergic reaction. As with all vaccines given by injection there is a very small risk of such reactions. Allergy to INFANRIX-IPV is rare. Any such severe reactions will usually occur within the first few hours of vaccination. Other events reported after INFANRIX-IPV vaccination, but not necessarily related to the vaccine include: - coughing, respiratory infections, bronchitis or viral - infection of the middle ear that may cause earache and temporary hearing loss - toothache, sore throat. Other side effects not listed above, can also occur during or soon after a dose of INFANRIX-IPV. Check with your doctor or nurse if your child has any other side effects.
