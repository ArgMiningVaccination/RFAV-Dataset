Some clients prefer to go the natural or \"holistic\" route from the beginning, because it is based on the healing power of nature and treats the entire person instead of a specific set of symptoms. Women's health is our primary focus as we work with women who have suffered recurrent pregnancy loss, who need menopause therapy, or who have fertility issues or conditions including endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hypothyroid or other hormone imbalances. Other services include IUI support and IVF acupuncture for women who desire the highest chance of success with intrauterine insemination or in-vitro fertilization procedures. What is naturopathic medicine? To put it in simple terms, it is an alternative or holistic approach that relies on nature and non-invasive treatment or therapy to promote self-healing of the body and mind. Components of naturopathy include acupuncture, herbal medicine, nutrition, meditation, therapeutic massage, prevention and lifestyle counseling, and more. There are six principles that include: - First do no harm - Therapies are the least invasive and risk of harmful side effects is minimal. - Identify and treat the cause - Identify root cause of symptoms so the cause may be treated instead of suppressing symptoms. - The healing power of nature - Modalities of treatment facilitate the innate ability of the body to heal itself. - Treat the whole person - The physical, emotional, mental and spiritual aspects make up the \"whole\" of the body; treatment focuses on the whole person rather than separate systems or organs of the body. - Doctor as teacher - Naturopathic practitioners encourage patients to be responsible for their health and educate each patient regarding lifestyle and dietary changes. - Prevention - Assessing susceptibility to disease, heredity and other risk factors help prevent future disease. When it comes to women's health, naturopathic medicine is instrumental in improving fertility, balancing mood, helping the body heal from diseases or conditions that affect fertility such as endometriosis, PCOS or hormonal imbalances, overcoming the negative issues often associated with menopause, and more. Natural medicine is also highly useful in prenatal and postnatal support and for women who have chosen to undergo IUI or IVF procedures in an effort to conceive and want to boost the odds of success. Traditional Chinese Medicine Naturopathic medicine encompasses many of the modalities of traditional Chinese medicine including acupuncture and herbal supplements. Functional medicine is another vital component of naturopathy, providing targeted nutrition to the organs, tissues and cells of the body to support healing through foods and supplements. Basically, we rely on nature to help our patients discover the power of self-healing and how the body works to overcome almost any disease or condition that impacts health and well-being. At The Axelrad Clinic we want to help you be in control of your health and fertility. Regardless of age, we provide customized care for a wide array of women's health issues. We invite those in Houston, Katy, Woodlands and surrounding areas to learn more about naturopathic medicine and how it can help you achieve your best overall health by calling 713-527-9555 now. \"Wanted to let you know I am officially pregnant!!

Common Questions HOW DOES ACUPUNCTURE HELP WITH FERTILITY? Acupuncture improves your neuroendocrine axis (the communication between your nervous and endocrine systems), enhances circulation to your ovaries and uterus, and dramatically reduces stress - all of which benefits your fertility. WHAT ABOUT HERBS? Herbal medicines have been used for fertility issues for centuries. They restore depleted glands, balance your endocrine system, reduce inflammation and have many other positive effects on your reproductive function. DO YOU GIVE DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS? Absolutely. You will receive specific dietary recommendations based on your unique needs in addition to our fertility diet plan that we've used for over a decade to help over a thousand couples conceive. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO WORK? We've seen it take as little as 4 weeks and as long as 12 months. Everybody is different and the time prognosis varies. WHAT ARE YOUR SUCCESS RATES? As of 2016, 70% of the patients we see for fertility issues end up having a baby. WHAT ARE MY CHANCES OF SUCCESS? Bottom line is that your situation is unique and once we meet with you we will be able to give you our best estimate of time and prognosis of outcome. WHAT QUALIFIES YOU AS A SPECIALIST?
