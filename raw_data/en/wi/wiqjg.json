Clients can also have appointments with me online by Skype. I do what I do because I love helping people to feel strong and healthy, connect to their higher self and deepen their divine feminine essence consciousness. I believe everyone can feel truly healthy and empowered to lead a happy life, not just take tablets to get rid of symptoms. So how did I get here? From Finance Professional to Meditation Teacher Years ago I worked in a stressful finance job and suffered from anxiety, always worrying about work. So when I heard meditation might help, I studied Tibetan Buddhism and went on to train as a Buddhist Meditation Teacher and Reiki Master. During training I was expected to practise daily energy-balancing meditations and I found the combination of Buddhist and Reiki meditations calmed my mind. Reiki taught me how to self heal and heal others but also helped me to trust my intuitive abilities and introduced me to one of my first spirit allies. At this point I created Golden-light Meditation and started to teach private Meditation classes. The Path to Becoming A Spiritual Homeopath and Anxiety Specialist When I was looking for a natural solution for my anxiety, hay fever and asthma, I was amazed to discover the homeopathic process not only eased my symptoms but also positively transformed my emotions - wow! Homeopathy also helped me manage pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and recover quickly from the birth. I now treat my twins with homeopathic remedies all the time, for childhood aches, pains, coughs and colds, and see how quickly they recover. I discovered once I finished my training how working with my intuition and spirit guides I could achieve deeper healing for my homeopathy clients too. How I Became a Shamanic /Ancestral Healer and Plant Spirit Healer After having children I was physically and mentally exhausted - my energy meditations were not enough. Okay, I had twins, but something deeper had changed. I went to see a Shamanic healer and she helped release and clear my energy channels. I left her house feeling like a new woman, much lighter and over the next few days my energy levels returned. This started my 'healing and revealing' spiritual journey with Shamanism and Soul healing. It is really interesting, as my journey to become a Shamanic/ Soul healer started way before that, I just didn't know it! I had always been looking for a path to connect to my 'intuition' or 'second sight' and my Reiki training was the start of this journey. When I qualified as a Reiki Master/ Teacher I was still on that journey looking. After my Shamanic healing I attended Way of the Shaman with Simon Buxton which taught me how to do a shamanic journey and introduced me to two 'all knowing' compassionate spirit allies. This created a profound shift for me as I had been longing to meet and talk with these helping spirits all my life. I then started a regular shamanic journey practise and after attending various courses in Shamanism my allies told me the time was right to train to be a Shamanic healer. I started this journey by attending a 2 year Intensive Shamanic Practitioner Training in Core Shamanism with Imelda Almquist, a teacher formed by Sandra Ingerman. I then trained with several gifted teachers including Annette Host, Anthea Durand, Caitlin Mathews, Caitlin Branigan, Emma Farrell, Shenoah Taylor and Ancestral Healing with Malidoma Some. I have recently trained with the talented Chief Abiye Ayele Kumari in Ifa and the Kemetian Women's Mysteries. I have been working with a female Egyptian Divine Force for over 20 years. I was guided by my helping spirits to find a teacher of Egyptian and Kemetu Culture, Egyptian and Kemetu Spiritual Principles and Hieroglyphics. I was directed to the talented Dr Rkhty Amen a Professor in Egyptology and initiated Kemetic Priestess. I first started my journey with Oak 25 years ago when I felt a strong presence and didn't know how to communicate. After my Introduction to Shamanism workshop I was taken on a journey to Oak and with time our relationship deepened. Through Oak I was introduced to Lady Hawthorn and in time was initiated by both. I have received plant spirit medicine teachings and initiations from Emma Farrell, Rebekah Shaman and various other plant spirit teachers . For me working with the plant spirits and all my helping spirits including wise benevolent ancestors is about entering into 'right relationship' with them so there is honour, respect and love. I love the magic of working with my helping spirits and healing ancestors to bring harmony, balance, healing and guidance for clients to clear un-healthy energies/ souls and restoring lost soul essences, so they can move forward in their lives with more confidence, groundedness, inner knowing and clarity. For many years empowering my clients has been one of my core missions in my healing work. I was guided to run a workshop on connecting women their Divine Feminine at the Awaken the Goddess Event in Hampstead. This was a new piece on how to own and go deeper into aligning with our Divine Essence. I felt very blessed to be given the opportunity to present at this event. I always knew Trees had spirits, I just didn't know how to communicate with them. My Tree spirit journey started during the course of my Core Shamanism training .I was drawn to a beautiful Oak and Hawthorn tree in my local park. I began to regularly visit and meditate with them. I felt very nurtured and our relationships blossomed from there. I have been receiving a nudge to start holding Plant and Tree Spirit Initiations. This is a new chapter in my relationship with the Tree Spirits. Please see Shamanic Courses and Free Meditations. I love being a sacred channel for the compassionate ancestors facilitating healing for clients and their ancestors so all can continue on their cosmic journey's with more harmony, balance and a deeper sense of sacred wholeness.
