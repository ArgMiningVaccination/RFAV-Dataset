Idiop athic nephrotic syndrome is reported to be one of the most frequent renal pathologies i n childhood.

Aiming to prevent pneumococcal infection is of paramount importan ce especially in this era of ever-increasing pneumococcal resistance to penicillin s and cephalosporins. The pneumococcal vaccines currently available are inactivate d vaccines\u2014the two main forms in use are polysaccharide vaccines and conjugated vac cines. However, the data supporting the use of these vaccines and to guide the tim ing and dosage recommendations is still limited for nephrotic children.

Among children with nephrotic syndrome, only a minority (2 0- 33%) have a single episode, while the majority have multiple rela pses. Male gender and young age atinitialpresentationhavebeenidentiedasriskfactorsf orfrequentrelapses( 5).Goonewardene et al. Pneumococcal Vaccination in Pediatric NS NS can broadly be divided into two groups based on underlying etiology: primary (idiopathic) and secondary, wi th primary being the dominant type. Primary or idiopathic nephrotic syndrome can be further subclassied based on histological characteristics or based on steroid responsiv eness. Minimal change disease represents the main histological subtypes identied for idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (INS) in childhood with the less common subtypes being focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranous nephropathy. INS is the most common form of disease in childhood and clinically, it is subdivided further based on response to steroid therapy into steroid-sensitive (SSNS) and steroi d resistant (SRNS) forms. The SSNS has further subgroups including frequent relapsers and steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS). The majority of patients (80-90%) respond to steroid therapy within 4 weeks of administration (SSNS) while SRNS is dened by persistent proteinuria in spite of 4 weeks of prednisolone therapy, while for SDNS, the hallmark is relapses while on steroid therapy or within 2 weeks of discontinuation( 2). From a clinical point of view, the classication of INS according to its response to steroid therapy has many implications, particularly with reference to increased risk of severe infection as steroids are immunosuppressive thus increasing the risk of infection. SRNS is associated with hea vy proteinuria which is also linked to higher risk of infection, possiblythroughurinarylossesofimmunoglobulins( 6,7). While there is a lack of denitive evidence regarding the mechanisms of pathogenesis of INS, there are a number of theories linking it to immune system dysregulation. This ha s implications both in terms of susceptibility to infection as well as possibly suboptimal response to vaccines. One theory implicates T cell dysfunction leading to cytokine release wh ich results in increased glomerular permeability ( 3). It has also been suggested that immune system dysfunction may result in increased levels of circulating factors that may cause alte red podocyte structure/function, resulting in proteinuria ( 8). The possibility of B cell involvement has been suggested based on patients achieving remission following administration o f rituximab,anantiCD20antibody( 9). Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major burden of infectious disease globally. In 2005, WHO estimated that 1.6 million people die of pneumococcal disease every year. This includes 0.7-1 million children below the age of 5 most of whom live in developing countries; while in developed countries th e major disease burden is carried by children aged <2 years old and the elderly. Any immunocompromising condition increases the likelihood of contracting pneumococcal disea se (10).Thegrowingresistanceof S.pneumoniae tocommonlyused antibiotics underlines the urgent need for vaccines to be us ed to controlpneumococcaldisease. The immune system dysregulation that is part of the pathophysiology of NS as well as the immunosuppressive drugs that are the standard therapy for NS results in children with NS being at increased risk of infections\u2014the most serious among these being peritonitis and sepsis as they carry a high morbidity and mortality. One of the mostcommon organisms associated with these in NS patients is S. pneumoniae . Although the pneumococcal vaccination has demonstrated signicant reduction in disease burden, there is often signicant confusion among medical professionals regarding the protocol for vaccinating children with NS against pneumococci, resulting in many of these children not being appropriately vaccinated. Our review will focus on the ecacy and safety of pneumococcal vaccination in children with NS. We also discuss the mechanisms of immunosuppression in NS as well as the current recommendationsforpneumococcalvaccinations. PNEUMOCOCCAL INFECTION IN CHILDREN WITH NEPHROTIC SYNDROME Children with NS are prone to developing signicant bacterial infections; and although the incidence of infections in NS h as decreased in advanced countries, they are still a major proble m in developing countries. Data shows that sepsis remains one of the main causes of death in children with NS while peritonitis i s oneofthemajorcausesofmorbidityandmortalityinNSpatien ts, andthemainorganismresponsibleforprimaryperitonitisinNS patientsis Streptococcuspneumoniae (11). From April 1993 to December 1997, Chang Gung Children's Hospital in Taiwan had 452 admissions of 231 children with nephrotic syndrome. There were 10 episodes of sepsis and 8 episodes of peritonitis, with 14 microorganisms cultured. Ou t of the 10 episodes of sepsis, 4 were due to S. pneumoniae and 2 of these 4 children died; there were no deaths recorded for th e other organisms. There were no cases of peritonitis due so S. pneumoniae in this data ( 12). This data was all collected prior to theintroduction ofpneumococcal vaccinationsinTaiwanwhe re PPVwasrstlicensedin1998butrarelyusedbefore2001,while PCV7wasrstintroducedinlate2005( 13). Krensky et al. ( 14) noted that between 1970 to 1980, in a retrospective review of 351 pediatric INS cases, there were 24 episodesofperitonitisamong19patients,with >50%ofthecases beingdueto S.pneumoniae .ThiswasbasedondatafromBoston andPPVwasrstlicensedintheUSAin1977. A Turkey involving 268 children with SSNS noted only 8 episodes of peritonitis among 7 patients (incidence of 2.6%) ( 15). Among the cases of peritonitis noted, the majority were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , with others being attributed to Gram negative bacteria ( 15). The 7- valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) was introduced by the Turkey National Immunization Program in 2008 and replacedbythePCV13in2011( 16).Themajorityofthesestudies were done prior to the large scale introduction of PPV, and well beforePCVin2000. We were unable to locate data specically mentioning frequency of S. pneumoniae infection in NS patients after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccinations, however globa l data do suggest that the vaccinations signicantly reduce t he diseaseburdenwhichhighlightsthecriticalnatureofpreve nting pneumococcal infection in NS patients by appropriately vaccinatingthesepatients.

Pneumococcal Vaccination in Pediatric NS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INFECTION IN NS AND IMPLICATIONS OF IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VACCINATION Immune deciency is part of the clinical picture of NS and is believed to be multifactorial, but there is limited data reg arding the precise nature and contribution of these factors. Figure1 illustrates the multiple pathophysiological elements of NS th at contribute to an increased risk of pneumococcal infection in these patients. An understanding of the theories related to immunosuppression in NS are key to this review as this is both the reason for increased susceptibility to invasive pneumoco ccal infection hence the strong need for vaccination; but it also may impact on the vaccine's ecacy in NS patients given that this requires a healthy immune system that is able to mount a response upon exposure to bacterial antigen. This conundrum reflectspartoftheconfusionsurroundinghowandwhentogive pneumococcal vaccinations to pediatric NS patients as althoug h the protection from the vaccine is very much needed, there is confusionregardingwhetheritshouldbegivenandifso,atw hich pointinthediseaseprocessitshouldbegiven.Disruption of the complement system is one of the better understood causes of immunosuppression in nephrotic syndrome.Thecomplementsystemisakeycomponentofinnate and adaptive immune responses and consists of two arms: the classical and the alternative. Several studies have demonst rated deciencies in Factor I and Factor B\u2014two factors that contro l C3 which is a key mediator of both the classical and alternativ e complement pathways. When activated by either the classical or alternative pathway, C3 is broken down into C3a and C3b, with C3b being an active form which is a potent opsonin. Various factors control the levels and activity of Factor C3b\u2014inclu ding FactorIandFactorB.FactorI,alsoknownasKAF,functionsas a C3binhibitor;whereasfactorBcombineswithC3b.Decienc ies inFactorIandFactorBhavebeendemonstratedtobeassociate d with severe infections ( 17,18). In nephrotic patients, reduced levels of Factor I and Factor B have been reported ( 19,20). Figure2 shows an overview of the complement cascade and wherethealterationsoccurinNSpatientswhichthenpredispos es to infection and also possibly leading to concerns regarding ecacyofvaccines. As early as 1977, it was reported that increased incidence of severeinfectioninpatientswithNSmaybeattributedtourin ary FIGURE 1 | Predisposing factors to pneumococcal infection in Nephrot ic Syndrome and pneumococcal vaccination as a strategy to re duce the risk of pneumococcal infection.

Pneumococcal Vaccination in Pediatric NS FIGURE 2 | Complement cascade for classical and alternative pathways illustrating the deciencies in the complement system in Nep hrotic Syndrome. lossesofFactorB.Thedisturbancetothealternativecomplem ent pathway increases the susceptibility of nephrotic patients to pyogenic infection, particularly encapsulated microorganism s likeS. pneumoniae due to the impaired complement dependent opsonisation( 3,21,22). The complement system has also been shown to have a key role in the ability to mount an eective response to vaccines, though it appears to have a larger role in response to polysaccharidevaccinecomparedtoconjugatedvaccines( 23). Depression of cell mediated immunity is another postulated mechanism of immunosuppression in nephrotic syndrome. It has long been accepted that there is a change in the T- lymphocyte response in NS which causes increased production of permeability factors, changing the function of key podocyt e proteins thus causing the proteinuria which is the hallmark of nephrotic syndrome ( 3). Fodor et al. suggested that a circulating serum factor is responsible for a reduction in T-lymphocyte functioninchildhoodminimalchangenephroticsyndrome( 24). ThestudyreportedthateventhoughTcellnumbersremainedin the normal range, there was a marked reduction in lymphocyte transformation during active disease. Nephrotic plasma was also found to inhibit the reactivity of normal lymphocytes, possibly due to the hyperlipidaemic conditions (characterist ic of NS) which inhibit blastic transformation. The authors al so proposed that decreased cell mediated immunity may be the eectofincreasedsuppressorTcellactivity( 24).Taubeetal.also demonstrateddiminishedlymphocytictransformationinNSd ueto minimal change disease, focal segmental membranous nephropathy ( 25). However, the ndings of Taube et al. suggested that the reduced lymphocyte response is likely secondary to the nephrotic state rather than due to a circulating factor ( 25). As shown in Figure1, T cells are a key partoftheimmuneresponsetoconjugatedvaccines,anddecit s intheirfunctionmayimpairtheimmunogenicityofthevaccin e. Besides cell mediated immunity, alteration in humoral immunityisalsobelievedtocontributetotheimmunedecie ncy associated with NS. It has been shown that during relapse periodsofSSNS,thereishypogammaglobulinaemiainvolvingth e reductionofthreeIgGsubclasses-IgG1,IgG2,andIgG3-placi ng patients at higher risk of bacterial and viral infection. How ever, interestingly, only Ig G2 remained signicantly low throug hout theremissionperiod,suggestingitisthemainfactorofpersi stent hypogammaglobulinaemiaduringremission( 26).Thisalsoraises the question of whether even if the body can mount an immune response whether the protective antibodies are then lost in the urine,thoughttodatedataonthisislacking. The increased susceptibility to infection in NS patients raise s thequestionofwhethertheywouldbenetfromimmunizations, however the altered immune function in NS patients also raises signicant questions about the ecacy of vaccinations in th is population in terms of the immune system ability to mount an adequateantibodyresponse. Oedema is yet another potential factor contributing to risk of infection in nephrotic syndrome ( 27). Oedema is a Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 4 August 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 339Goonewardene et al. Pneumococcal Vaccination in Pediatric NS hallmark of NS and occurs due to the hypoalbuminemia and increased capillary permeability\u2014this results in intravasc ular volume depletion which triggers compensatory mechanisms to reabsorb sodium and water, one of which is activation of the sodium-potassium pump in the collecting duct of the kidney which increases the possibility of entry of infections agent s and transmission of infection ( 27,28). Infective complications have been shown to be reduced when the duration of oedema is lessened,howeverwhetheroedemareallypredisposestoinfec tion or is just simply a marker of serious and unresponsive disease i s uncertain( 27,29). Defective splenic function is another possible factor for the increased susceptibility to encapsulated organisms in patien ts with nephrotic syndrome. Mcvicar et al. demonstrated that among nine children with primary NS, 4 had decreased splenic function and that particular patient population had 6 episodes of bacterial infection, suggesting a link between s plenic hypofunction and increased risk of bacterial infection ( 30). However, Berns et al. reported that impaired splenic function i s unlikely to be a major cause in the predisposition of NS patients towardbacterialinfection( 31). Lastly, iatrogenic causes do contribute to NS related immunosuppression due to the cytotoxic agents used as treatment. A meta-analysis investigating the use of cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil as treatment of relapsing NS in children found that among the subjects treated with either drug, 1/3 of them were shown to have leukopenia while 1.5 and 6.8% treated with cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil, respectively, developed severe bacterial inf ections (32). There have been doubts regarding ecacy of vaccines given to nephrotic patients who are on high dose steroids as their immunosuppressive eects may also diminish the immune response to the vaccine. Data on this is presented inTables2,3. There are signicant numbers of both viral and bacterial infections documented in children with NS. However, bacter ial infections tend to be more worrying as they represent the main cause of mortality among children with NS; and the predominant culprits for these bacterial infections are S. pneumoniae,Escherichiacoli andHaemophilus sp.(45).Themost common among these causative agents was S. pneumoniae at 38 and 50% as demonstrated by Krensky et al. and Gorensek et al., respectively ( 14,29,46). Given that infection with S. pneumoniae is largely vaccine preventable, vaccination against pneumococcus is recommended for pediatric NS patients ( 47). There are at present 2 options available\u2014a 13 valent conjugate vaccine and a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine, and this rev iew aims to explore the evidence regarding the eectiveness and safetyofpneumococcalvaccinationinchildrenwithNS. PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATIONS\u2014THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND MECHANISM OF ACTION The rst ever attempt to vaccinate humans against pneumococcus took place in Africa in 1911 using a whole cellvaccine. Advances in understanding germ theory led to typing of pneumococci then the isolation of capsular polysaccharides in 1916. This then paved the way for the creation of the rst quadrivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) in 1944-1945 which did show promising results, then a hexavalent vaccinewasdevelopedin1947.However,atthispoint,clinicia ns preferred to treat with antibiotics rather than vaccinate un til it wasrecognizedthatantibioticresistancewasbecomingacon cern withcontinuedhighcasefatalityratesinspiteoftreatment ;thus, eorts were reintensied to create eective vaccines. This th en led to a to 14 valent PPV being licensed in 1977 and this was followed by the 23 valent pneumococcal vaccine which was rst introduced in the United States in 1983 ( 48). Polysaccharide vaccines act via a T-cell independent mode of B-cell stimulat ion whichisnotabletogenerateamemoryeect;andpneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines are poorly immunogenic in children youngerthan2yearsofage.Thisisofconcernas80%ofinvasi ve pneumococcal disease occurs in children under the age of 2(49). To improve the immune response to the capsular polysaccharide in young children, third-generation vaccin es in which capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to one of several dierent proteins were developed. The rst such vaccin e to be registered by the FDA for use in infants and children in February 2000 was a 7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) named Prevnar this a 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was licensed in March 2010 (51), and now a 13-valent PCV is available. Conjugate vaccines act via stimulation of T cells and consequently tend to have a superior antibody response, maintenance of antibody levels f or a longer duration and induction of immunological memory (52). In addition, conjugate pneumococcal vaccines have been shown to have excellent immunogenicity in children below 2 years of age ( 49,53,54).Figure3 depicts the dierences between PPV and PCV in terms of their structure and the immuneresponse. Pneumococci are divided about 90 distinct pneumococcal serotypesbasedondierencesinthepolysaccharidecompositio n of the capsule. The spectrum of prevailing capsular types varies with age, time and geographical region, although common serotypes are consistently identied throughout the world. Globally, about 20 serotypes are associated with >80% of invasive pneumococcal disease occurring in all age groups, the 13 most common serotypes cause at least 70-75% of invasive disease ( 10).The vaccines have always targeted the most prevalent strains causing invasive disease and since the ir introduction,therehavebeentremendousreductionsininv asive pneumococcal disease due to strains included in the vaccines (55). A Cochrane review of conjugate pneumococcal vaccines reported that the pooled vaccine ecacy was (95% CI 29- 75%) against all serotype invasive disease in children under 2 year (56). However, the rates of infection due to strains not included in the vaccines has risen ( 55).

CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATION In Healthy Children In a 2007 position paper, the WHO strongly recommended that pneumococcal vaccination be included in national childhood immunization programme ( 10). As of 2018, 142 countries had introduced the pneumococcal vaccination as part of their nationalimmunizationprogram( 57). For PCV administration to infants, WHO recommends 3 primary doses (the 3p +0 schedule); or 2 primary doses plus a booster (the 2p +1 schedule). If the 3p +0 schedule is used, vaccination can be initiated as early as 6 weeks of age with an interval between doses of 4-8 weeks, with doses given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks or at 2, 4, and 6 months, depending on programmatic convenience.Ifthe2p +1scheduleisselected,the 2 primary doses should be given during infancy as early as 6 weeks of age at an interval preferably of 8 weeks or more for the youngest infants and 4-8 weeks or more between primarydoses for infants aged 7 months. One booster dose should be given between 9 and 15 months of age. In choosing between the 3p+0 and 2p+1 schedules, countries should consider locally relevant factors including the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease,thelikelycoverage,andthetimelinessofthevacc ine.This issummarizedin Table1. Ifthisscheduleisadheredtoallchildrenwillbeprotectedf rom themainpneumococcalstrainsbytheageof6months,andgiven that the majority of cases of NS occur between the ages of 2 and 6 yearswith only avery small fraction havingcongenital NS a nd infantile NS, the vast majority of children with NS will alre ady have protection against pneumococcal infection at the time of rstpresentation. Recommendations for Immunocompromised Children It is recommended that immunocompromised children aged 2-18 who have completed the immunization with PCV 7 or Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 6 August 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 339Goonewardene et al. Pneumococcal Vaccination in Pediatric NS FIGURE 4 | Recommended pneumococcal immunization pathway for childr en with Nephrotic Syndrome. PCV13shouldreceiveadoseofPPV23inviewoftheincreased spectrumofcoverageagainstmoreserotypes( 58). In the UK, specic recommendations exist for NS where children with INS are oered an additional dose of PPV when theyareabove2yearsofage( 59). ACIP guidelines for immunocompromised children between the ages of 6 and 18 are that PPV na\u00efve children receive a rst dose of PCV 13 followed at least 8 weeks later by a dose of PPV 23 and then another dose of PPV23 at least 5 years later. Those vaccinatedwithPPV23shouldreceiveasingledoseofPCV13at least8weeksafterthelastPPV23dose,eveniftheyhadprevio usly received PCV7. Children under the age of 10 with ongoing INS may require revaccination 5 years after this initial regime n (60). Thisissummarizedin Figure4. Of note, in USA, the cost per dose in the private sector for PPV13 is US$100.19 while the cost of PCV13 is US$188.26 (61). Although the PCV is signicantly more expensive, the fact it confers protection on the vulnerable group of <2 year olds justies the cost. It is worth noting that even though th e vaccines have been introduced in a country, unless they are included in the national immunization program, the cost of having the vaccine administered privately results in low upta ke among the population. In recognition of this fact, however, in Gavi 73 countries eligible for nancial aid, PCV 13 vaccine c an be purchased at US$2.90 per dose as of 2019, a price reduction of5centscomparedto2018,makingthevaccineaordableinan eorttoreducediseaseburden.Smith et al. ( 62) compared the cost eectiveness of PCV 13 vs. PPV 23 and showed that PCV13 vaccination was favored compared with PPSV23, but the analysis was sensitive to assumptions about PCV13 eectiveness against non-bacteremi c pneumococcal pneumonia and the magnitude of potential indirect eects from childhood PCV13 on pneumococcal serotype distribution. This work used pneumococcal disease cases prevented and incremental costs per quality-adjusted lif e- year (QALY) gained as the outcome measured. Delgleize et al. (63) showed that the price increase associated with converting PCV 7 to PCV 13 in the UK would be cost eective in terms of reducing cost associated with invasive pneumococcal disea se saving 734 QALYs as well as \u00a33.68 million to the National HealthService(NHS).AlthoughthecostofPCV13isprohibitiv e, a recent study by Chen et al. ( 64) published in the Lancet Global Health estimate that global PCV13 use could prevent 0.399 million child deaths (95% credible interval 0.208-0. 711 million) and 54.6 million disease episodes (51.8-58.1 million ) annually.Theircalculationsshowedthatthecostofvaccinat ions would be oset by societal cost savings of $2.64 billion (2.13 - 3.28billion). In high risk cohorts such as the immunocompromised pediatric NS patients, even those who have completed their primaryregimen(aslongastheyare >2years)arerecommended to receive a dose of PPV23 which has the advantage of covering a greater number of strains even though it lacks the advantage of a memory or booster eect. However, the common Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 7 August 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 339Goonewardene et al. Pneumococcal Vaccination in Pediatric NS clinicaldilemmaisthekeyquestionsurroundingvaccinee cacy in NS children i.e., whether or not the vaccine is actually eective in active disease or if disease related or treatment related immunosuppression actually renders the pneumococcal vaccineineective. EFFICACY OF PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE IN NS PATIENTS Pneumococcalpolysaccharidevaccine(PPV)haslongbeenuse d for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in childr en with nephrotic syndrome, and more recently PCV has been used since its introduction in the year 2000. Even though its eectiveness in evoking an antibody response has been well- demonstrated by several published studies ( 6,33,34,37), there hasbeensomecontroversyregardingitsactualbenetaspati ents with NS have been reported to develop severe pneumococcal disease despite vaccination. There is also a lack of agreemen t as to the optimal timing of administration with reference to sta ges of NS (7,34,37,65). The data from various studies looking at the ecacy of vaccines in nephrotic patients is summarized in Table2(forPPV)and Table3(forPCV). Overall, the data for PPV trials indicate that NS patients are able to generate antibody responses comparable to control groups, achieving protective levels of antibody with geometr ic mean titers of >200 ngN/mL, for all strains included except strain 19, especially 19F ( 6,33-35). The lack of response to strain 19F may be an area worth researching further as it may oer insights into ways to enhance immunogenicity in the immunocompromisedcohort. Lee et al. ( 37) demonstrated that NS children were able to increase their antibody levels to 2x baseline, however compa red to controls, their baseline antibody levels were lower henc e nal concentrationofantibodywaslowerrelativetohealthycon trols. In studies which included a proportion of the cohort on steroids or immunosuppressives, the patients on these medications were able to achieve protective levels of antibo dies followingimmunizationwithPPV( 6,34,35)andPCV( 42,44). Ulinski et al. ( 39) demonstrated that PPV23 given during active disease to patients on high dose prednisolone were able to mount an antibody response of a 10-fold increase on day 30 post vaccination, similar to that of NS patients given vaccine in remission while on low dose prednisolone. In a follow up to this study at 36 months post vaccination, antibody levels remained high in both groups and there were no reports of invasive pneumococcal disease in any of the participants ( 40). Results from Guven et al. ( 38) however, showed that 4 out of 9 patientswithSSNShadadropinantibodytiterstobelowbasel ine by36monthspostPPV23vaccination. PersistenceofantibodyresponseafterPPV14wasmaintained above protective levels 5 years after initial vaccination in NS patients with MCNS but not those with non-MCNS variants (35). Spika et al. ( 36) demonstrated persistence of antibodies above protective levels 1 year after initial vaccination in 5 0% of patientsagainst6strains,howevertheyfoundthatantibody levels droppedfasterinrelapserscomparedtonon-relapsers.Garin and Barrett ( 7) demonstrated that even NS patients in active disease are able to mount IgM response against serotype s 3 and 19 post PPV 14 or PPV23 at levels comparable to controls but had signicantly lower IgG levels which may be attribute d to urinary losses of IgG in active disease as IgG was found in the urine of NS patients and there was a signicant correlatio n betweenalbuminlevelsandantibodytiter. There is relatively less literature available for PCV as comparedtoPPV,butthedatasuggeststhatinNSpatients,PCV7 is able to provoke a rise in baseline antibody levels to above t he protectivethreshold,thoughthelevelsvaryfordierentser otypes (42). At 12-14 months post vaccination, the protective levels of antibody were maintained above baseline. This cohort wer e followedupanditwasdemonstratedthatboosterPCV7dose12 months after initial dose in NS patients is safe and was able to provokeasignicantriseinantibodylevels( 43). PCV 13 has also been shown to be highly immunogenic in NS patients with the ability to induce high serotype- specic IgG titers that are maintained in the high range 1 year after immunization. This patient cohort included those on steroids and immunosuppressive and all groups had similar vaccine responses; however, those on prednisolone or immunosuppressives had lower IgG titers for serotypes 14 and23F. Overall the data seem to suggest that patients with nephrotic syndromeareabletomountanadequateimmuneresponseboth to PPV as well as PCV even when the vaccine is given during active disease and while on steroids or immunosuppressives.

OF PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATION IN CHILDREN WITH NEPHROTIC SYNDROME Pneumococcal vaccination has generally been shown to be saf e by numerous studies. Local reactions appear to be one of the fewcommonproblems;thesearearelativelyminorcomplicatio n which are not of great clinical signicance. In 1978, Fikrig et al. had established that vaccination of NS patients and healthy controls with PPV13 did not lead to any signicant adverse eects, with the only side eects noted being local soreness (33). Lee et al. ( 37) had demonstrated similar ndings with PPV23, with 38% of children with NS and 50% of subjects in the healthy group developing local reactions to it; in this st udy, the probability of patients with NS developing local reactions appears to be lower than healthy subjects ( 37). Pittet et al. however, found that local and systemic reactions to PCV13 amongchildrenwithNSwerefoundtobecomparabletohealthy children. More importantly, no serious adverse events were recorded in this study; and no association was found between vaccination with PCV13 and relapse of NS.

Pneumococcal Vaccination in Pediatric NS up, 3 were vaccinated at disease onset while 5 received PCV13 during follow up. The relapse risk attributed to NS itself for this group of patients was 1 relapse per year, whereas the corresponding value for the patients vaccinated at disease on set was not known. The occurrence of relapse appears to have remained unchanged post-vaccination for patients vaccinate d during follow up, indicating that PCV13 on its own does not increase relapse risk ( 44). Liakou et al. too reported that local and systemic reactions recorded within 7 days to PCV7 were similar in patients and controls. More specically, reactions involving only the injection site seemed to be commonest with 30.8% of all vaccinated individuals experiencing them. In contrast, only 2% of all vaccinated individual developed fever and hence, appears to occur less frequently than injecti on site reactions. Administration of a booster of PCV7 was also noted to cause similar rates of systemic reactions, injecti on- site adverse reactions along with fever ( 43). In addition, this study also provided evidence that vaccination with PCV7 does not contribute to an increased risk of relapse, with a total of 20 episodes of relapse occurring a year prior to vaccination while only 10 such episodes occurred post-vaccination ( 42). The administrationofboostervaccinationwasnotassociatedw ithan increasedriskofrelapse( 43). A case report describing the emergence of a Pityriasis rosea like eruption, in a child with NS who had received a synthetic HepatitisBandaPolyvalentconjugatevaccine(PCV)wasnote d. This eruption was thought to be caused by PCV due to the strong correlation between the time of PCV administration a nd eruption, and the absence of recurrence of eruptions when the patient received further doses of Hepatitis B vaccine ( 66). Although this might be an isolated case, it does demonstrate to the possibility of the occurrence of Pityriasis rosea like eruption withPCVadministration. Overall, there is a reassuring lack of serious adverse eects reported to the pneumococcal vaccination; and there appears to be a similar side eect prole in children with NS and healthy controls. Therefore, the considerable benets des cribed above, on a background of S. pneumoniae being the commonest cause of infection in children with INS ( 29), would signicantly outweigh the relatively mild side eects of PCV and PPV23. Consequently,pneumococcalvaccinationinchildrenwithIN Sis tobeencouraged. Among the studies that were reviewed, numerous studies were used enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to measure serotype-specic antibodies ( 39,40,42-44), whereas older studies had measured total anti-pneumococcal antibod y titres. A potential drawback of this method would be the detection of serotype specic non-opsonic antibodies, which do not confer any form of protection. Hence, it is not as eective as opsonophagocytosis assay (OPA) in predicting the true level of protection provided by the antibodies. However, it is important to take note that ELISA has received extensive validation due to the emergence and establishment of antibo dy thresholds that provide adequate protection against Invasiv e pneumococcal disease among children ( 67). Furthermore, the strong correlation between OPA titres and ELISA IgG levels in children provides further strengthens the validity of ELI SA.However, the concordance between OPA titres and ELISA IgG levelsislessprominentamongadults( 68). BARRIERS TO VACCINATION OF NEPHROTIC PATIENTS KeybarrierstopediatricNSpatientsreceivingthepneumococc al vaccine would be the prohibitively high cost and the fact that a great deal of confusion surrounds the optimal vaccination protocolinNSpatients. Cost as a Barrier to Vaccination Not all countries have introduced pneumococcal vaccination as part of their national immunization program. Even in countrie s where it is recommended, it is not always subsided or funded by the government, making it prohibitive for the average citi zen to have their children vaccinated. A total of 142 countries h ave introducedPCVfrom2000through2018.Ofthe73Gavi-eligib le countries, 59 (81%) introduced PCV. Among non-Gavi eligible countries, PCV has been introduced in 6 (50%) of 12 lower middle-income countries, 26 (51%) of 51 upper middle-income countries, and 51 (88%) of 58 high-income countries ( 57). Given the prohibitively high cost of the vaccine in the private sector, government support would be including pneumococcal vaccinationintheNIPwouldgreatlyboostuptake. There was no specic data available for cost eectiveness of pneumococcal vaccinations of PCV vs. PPV in the pediatric nephrotic population, however a report by ACIP (2012) looking atcost-eectivenessofimmunizingimmunocompromisedadult s against pneumococcal disease with regimen of PCV13 at time of diagnosis followed by current PPV 23 vaccination guideline s starting 1 year later resulted in a cost saving of $7,600,000 a nd added 1360 quality adjusted life years and averted 57 cases of invasivepneumococcaldisease. Cho et al. ( 69) reported that adding a single dose of PCV 13 as an additional dose to immunocompromised adults instead of only the recommended PPV 23 potentially reduces both disease and costs. The additional cost of giving the addition al dose of PCV 13 would cost $16 million (in 2009$) but provide o-setting savings of $21 million per cohort from the societal perspective. This dose of PCV13 would prevent 57 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease, 619 cases of hospitalized all- causepneumonia,avert93deaths,andsave1360qualityadjust ed life years per cohort. While this is for an adult population and covered 4 immunocompromising conditions, it seems logical that to extrapolate that this should be applicable to the pediatri c nephroticpopulationaswell(particularlythose >2yearsoldwho mayonlyberecommendedtoreceivePPV). Based on the data currently available, it seems to suggest th at vaccinationagainstpneumococcaldiseaseinNSpatientsislik ely tobecost-eectiveinthelongrun. Lack of Clarity Regarding Protocols for Pneumococcal Vaccination Among nephrotic patients specically there is a great deal of uncertainty among medical practitioners regarding appropriat e Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 16 August 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 339Goonewardene et al. Pneumococcal Vaccination in Pediatric NS vaccination practices\u2014whether or not is appropriate and eective, and even if they feel it is appropriate, there is uncertainty regarding dose and timing. Clear guidelines sho uld be drawn up at national or institutional level and then implemented. Given that the majority of pediatric patients wit h NS will end up admitted to a tertiary level pediatric facility, particularly at rst diagnosis, this represents an opportunity to screenvaccinationstatusandadministerappropriatevaccine s. SmithandMetzger( 70)reportedthesuccessofamultifaceted intervention on pneumococcal vaccine in screening and administration rates in eligible patients who were admitted to an internal medicine unit of a tertiary care teaching hospita l\u2014 their interventions included a revised nurse screening too l, rescheduling of the vaccine order, storage of the vaccine in automated dispensing cabinets on the nursing unit and creati on of a vaccine tracking system. The rate of pneumococcal vaccin e administration in eligible patients signicantly improved po st- implementation compared with pre-implementation (74.2 vs. 19.1%, respectively, P<0.001). Harris et al. ( 71) also reported a similar improvement when a multifaceted protocol including clearguidelinesandprocedureforscreeningandflaggingpati ents forwhompneumococcalvaccinewasindicatedwasintroducedi n a pediatric rheumatology unit. The authors note it was relati vely simple to institute and maintain this system in a well run hospital unit, making it a model that could be used in pediatric units managing NS patients to help optimize pneumococcal vaccination practices. Clear guidelines need to be drawn up regarding the pneumococcal vaccination policy in NS patients andtheycouldthenbeimplementedthroughasimilarmodel. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Since their introduction in 1977, pneumococcal vaccines hav e been used for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease s, which have high prevalence and mortality rate among nephrotic children. The data supporting the use of these vaccines and to guide the timing and dosage recommendations is however,limited. Although several studies have been conducted they are limited by small sample size, ranging from 9 to 68 participants (38,39). A larger number of participants is required to produce results with adequate statistical power, however, du e to ethical considerations and complexity of trial design whe n involving high risk and immunocompromised patients, such trialsareextremelydiculttobecarriedout.Nevertheles s,more focus should be put on conducting international, multicentr e randomizedcontrolledtrialswhichinvolvealargesamplesiz ein thefuture,withparticularemphasisonestablishingtheeca cyof thepneumococcalconjugatevaccineforwhichtheevidenceup to today,isverymuchlacking. In addition, controversial results have been reported on whether or not antibody titer correlates with clinical eca cy of the vaccine in nephrotic patients ( 35,72). We feel that this is an important area for future work as all studies to date measure antibody concentration rather than the clinical e cacy of the vaccine directly, i.e., risk of pneumococcal peritonit is.The vaccine will not serve its intended purpose if it induces an increase in antibody titers but does not provide adequate anti-pneumococcalprotection. ComparedtoPPV,PCVisamuchmorerecentinventionand only a handful of trials have been conducted on it. Neverthel ess, guidelines recommend the use of PCV in nephrotic children as PPV in some studies shows inconsistency in its immune activit y in children below 2 years old as described previously. Thus, w e suggest future work to focus on the study of PCVs compared to PPV; there is still much yet to be explored for PCV, for example thepersistenceofantibodyconcentrationsafteraperiodoft ime, its eectiveness in dierent types of NS and factors that may aect its activity such as high dose steroid treatment, the use of alkylating agents, plasma albumin level and stage of diseas e where vaccine is administered. Endeavors can also be made to increase the cost eectiveness of the production of PCV as the costlyvaccineupuntilnow,isunaordabletomany. Although perhaps less in vogue now, research on PPV is still clinically relevant as it is still frequently used, espec ially in patients above 2 years old. The explanation for poorer antibodyresponsetowardPS19isinadequateanditisimportan t to know the reason since PS19 is commonly involved in pneumococcal diseases in individuals in all age groups ( 7). Type specic analysis was suggested to study the fall in antibody titres by Spika et al. as it was found to dier by capsular type ( 36). Participants in the study by Ulinski et al. demonstrated dierent increase of post-vaccination antibody titer from a range of 2-50 folds, and after exploring various possible factors such as age, plasma albumin level, steroid treatment and even vitamin D level, the cause behind was still not known. This unanswered research question provides an opportunity for future studies to be carried out and the informationyieldedfromthesestudiescouldprovetobedecisi ve in the development of a new and improved version of the vaccine(39). CONCLUSIONS After review of the literature, we would recommend that all childrenbeimmunizedagainst S.pneumoniae andagreestrongly withtheWHOrecommendationthatpneumococcalvaccination bemadepartofallnationalimmunizationprograms.Thiswould then confer protective immunity against S. pneumoniae in the vast majority of children who develop NS as this usually only rst presents between the ages of 2 and 6. Even in children who have completed their primary series, given that NS is an immunocompromising and therefore high risk condition, we would suggest an additional dose of PPV23 at point of diagnosis even though the patient is commencing steroid therapy as there still appears to be an adequate response in active disease and on steroids. For NS patients aged >2 years old who have never been immunized against pneumococcus, we would recommend a primary dose of PCV 13 followed by PPV23; again we would suggest that the vaccination be given early in the disease process as the studies seem to indicate an adequat e antibody response, though need for subsequent boosters may Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 17 August 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 339Goonewardene et al.
