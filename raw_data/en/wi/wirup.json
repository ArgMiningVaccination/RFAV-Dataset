Many people have not yet discovered this treatment or the benefits it can provide. As such, our team at Chiro-Med Health & Wellness Centers in Orland Park, IL, has answered some of the top questions below. What Exactly Is Therapeutic Massage? Therapeutic massage in a chiropractic clinic is similar to a traditional massage clinic. It involves applying force and movement to troubled or damaged areas to relieve tension, break up scar tissue, and more. Our chiropractic massage is more about addressing the full body than specific areas causing pain or discomfort. Why Do Chiropractors Offer Therapeutic Massage? For some people, receiving a massage in a chiropractic environment seems strange, but it's very natural and ties directly into a chiropractor's specialty. Chiropractors are trained to treat issues with the entire musculoskeletal system. And often, if one system component is compromised, it affects the rest. For example, if a muscle in the back is tense, it can strain the spine. Conversely, if misalignment is present in the bones of the spine, it can cause the muscles to overcompensate. Therefore, our chiropractor uses methods that address hard and soft tissues to achieve optimal relief. How Can Massage Therapy Benefit My Condition? Massage can break up the tension, scar tissue, trigger points, and more that cause ongoing pain and suffering. It's also incredible in promoting the body's natural healing processes. It improves the flow of blood and nutrients to the treatment site, all of which help reduce inflammation and pain. Massage also promotes the release of endorphins, a natural painkiller. Will It Hurt? When muscles are tense or an injury is present, it's not unusual to experience discomfort when it's being addressed. However, we do not want you to be in pain, that is what we work to relieve. Therefore, let us know immediately if you experience anything more than mild discomfort.
