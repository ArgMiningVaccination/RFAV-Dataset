People with asthma have inflamed airways which are sensitive to things that may not bother other people. These things are \"triggers.\" The most common asthma triggers include allergies, air pollution and other airborne irritants, other health conditions including respiratory infections, exercise or physical activity, weather and air temperature, strong emotions, and some medicines. Asthma triggers vary from person to person. Some people react to only a few while others react to many. If you have asthma, it is important to keep track of the causes or triggers that you know make your asthma worse. Because the symptoms do not always occur right after exposure, this may take a bit of detective work. Delayed asthma episodes may occur depending on the type of trigger and how sensitive a person is to it. [Allergies (Allergic Asthma)](/asthma/asthma-triggers/allergens-and-allergic-asthma/) Substances that cause allergies (allergens) can trigger asthma. If you inhale something you are allergic to, you may experience asthma symptoms. It is best to avoid or limit contact with known allergens to decrease or prevent asthma episodes. Common allergens that cause allergic asthma include: Learn more about [allergic asthma](/asthma/asthma-triggers/allergens-and-allergic-asthma/).

Exercise - especially in cold air - is a frequent asthma trigger. [Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction](/asthma/asthma-triggers/exercise/) (EIB) is triggered by physical activity can can impact people with or without asthma. People used to call it exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Symptoms may not appear until after several minutes of sustained exercise. (If symptoms appear sooner than this, it usually means you need to adjust your treatment.) With proper treatment, you do not need to limit your physical activity. Exercise is important for everyone, including people with asthma! Learn more about [exercise-induced asthma](/asthma/asthma-triggers/exercise/). [Weather](/asthma/asthma-triggers/weather/) Dry wind, cold air, or sudden changes in weather or temperature can sometimes bring on an asthma episode. [Thunderstorm asthma](https://community.aafa.org/blog/thunderstorms-and-asthma-an-unexpected-connection) can also affect people with asthma if a thunderstorm hits during high pollen and high humidity. The lightning can hit pollen and break the grains into smaller pieces. Wind from the storm spreads these particles around, making it easier for people to inhale them.
