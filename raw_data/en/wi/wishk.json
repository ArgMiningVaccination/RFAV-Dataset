Diseases have been a curse to living beings since the first man on the planet or the ancestral apes. Nobody is free diseases. Man has been trying to overcome diseases since time immemorial. In the process, he developed various medical systems like Chinese, Greek, Mesopotamian, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Allopathy etc. Among them, the system that revolutionized medicine is Allopathy or English Medicine. It is one of the youngest medical systems in the world next to Homeopathy. Its Contribution remains unparalleled no doubt. Allopathic Medicine is more of a chemical medical or synthetic medicine that differentiates it from the AYUSH Systems. In initial days it got very good results with penicillin against bacterial infections later on various other newer generation antibiotics were found to be more effective against numerous bacteria. Penicillin later became completely obsolete because of one reason drug resistance. Now the current generation of antibiotics faces the same threat. The same is the story with antifungals and anti-virals. In India, people have easy access to many schedule drugs which must not be sold without prescription. Nobody cares to bother about it. The end result we have high drug resistance. Allopathic drugs in spite of the roaring success in infectious diseases, they are struggling with the proper management of non-communicable diseases. The long time side effects of these drugs need to be evaluated. Using chemical drugs is not the only right way of management of a condition. Patient with diabetes is more like to become hypertensive. They both can damage multiple organs of the body. Vascular supply may be affected. There is a high possibility of cardiovascular damage, The Chemical drugs on a long period are sure to damage the liver and kidney. Ultimately the people succumb to death with multiple syndromes. Are people not aware of these facts? Why complicate health by taking chemical drugs that are doing more harm than good? What is the use of building seven-star terminal care with all facilities when the person could have been saved without chemical drugs 20 years ago? It's like Slowly feed the poison and when all organs are damaged, treat him at a super speciality terminal care to prolong his life. Isn't that ridiculous? My question is why to damage your health by consuming those chemical concoctions in multiple tablets and capsules. Why nobody is raising their voice. Are people so dumb? Are you paying money to kill yourself over a period of time by destroying your organs? None of the chemical drugs helps to nourish your tissues, instead it only damages. Small amounts of minerals can be obtained through natural sources. I know I am harsh but this is the bitter truth. People despite all this are not willing to take herbal concoctions which may be bitter but will not damage the health. The Chemical drugs, on the other hand, exert their action physiologically but cause extensive anatomical damage over a period of time. Diabetic drugs may manage blood sugar but destroy the pancreas. Hypertensive drugs control hypertension but destroy the heart over a period of time. Dear patrons take note that the pharma industry is big trillion-dollar business. And these chemical doctors will lose their customer if you are cured. Thus In allopathy, there is no medical cure for any of the health conditions like diabetes, hypertension, obesity, hair loss, etc. They want you to be a life long customer and die in their sever star state of the art hospital with final bills running to several lakhs or crores. Ayurveda and yoga, on the other hand, offer holistic health service to the patients. By taking a herbal decoction and practising proper diet, lifestyle and yoga you will be in a better state of health. And no fear of damaging your internal organs of the chemical drugs. So now you know that there is an alternate solution to your health issues. It is up to you to decide. So my conclusion is to highlight the bad effects of a chemical drug. Allopathy is a good system yet it has its cons. So it is the responsibility of the user to choose what is good for him. When it is an utmost emergency and where other systems fail to choose chemical drugs. When there is no emergency better to go with herbal concoctions. We always recommend a sensible and integrated approach for the welfare of your health. Remember too much of chemicals can kill you, be in medicine or as pesticides in food. Live Sensibly. "}
