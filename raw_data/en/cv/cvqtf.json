The protocol is a document that describes how a clinical trial will be conducted (the objective(s), design, methodology, statistical considerations and organization of a clinical trial,) and ensures the safety of the trial subjects and integrity of the data collected. A [research protocol ](/sites/g/files/tkssra261/f/Protocol_Template_052217.doc)is a document that describes the background, rationale, objectives, design, methodology, statistical considerations, and organization of a clinical research project. According to the ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines, a protocol should include the following topics: - Title Page (General Information) - Background Information - Objectives/Purpose - Study Design - Selection and Exclusion of Subjects - Treatment of Subjects - Assessment of Efficacy - Assessment of Safety - Adverse Events - Discontinuation of the Study - Statistics - Quality Control and Assurance - Ethics - Data handling and Recordkeeping - Publication Policy - Project Timetable/Flowchart - References - Supplements/Appendices The [NIH](http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/toolkit/) provides many resources for protocol development to assist investigators in writing and developing clinical research protocols that are in compliance with regulatory/GCP requirements. Some NIH institutes have a mandatory requirement for using their protocol template. For more information on protocol resources at UCSF and for a video with information about protocol development -please click [here](https://courses.ucsf.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=143608). Sample Protocol Template](/sites/g/files/tkssra261/f/Retrospective review protocol template.doc)- The protocol template is a tool to help facilitate the development of protocols for retrospective chart reviews.
