And, yes, it is as gut wrenching a journey as some do describe. It is the ultimate trigger for the deepest level of healing and spiritual acsension one can experience. I do not believe that the Universe forces an introduction until it is the right time to do the deep work that is needed to give birth to a new you. If You Had No Interest in Spirituality or Personal Development Before Meeting your Twin... Then that person is a karmic relationship. Here in lies the problem with the concept of toxic relationships versus twin flames \u2014 we often put up with behavior that does not make sense to others if we get told that someone is a twin flame.
