This project is focused on the development of biomaterial-based vaccines against prostate cancer. This work will integrate advanced injectable hydrogels, hypoxia-fighting nanoparticles, tumor-specific proposed biomaterials can overcome hypoxia-driven immunosuppression in cancer vaccines and improve therapeutic efficacy. The NIH fund will support this work in collaboration with Prof. Sitkovsky to further optimize and test this novel cancer vaccines in animal models, a critical step for translational research and moving on to the first stage of clinical testing in humans.
