The fellowship website ( https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/medicine/sections is a great resource \u2014it is frequently updated and has the most up to date policies and schedules. If there is a discrepancy, please reach out to the Program Director, Associate Program Direct or, or Program Manager for clarification. Given that we practice in an ever- evolving field of medicine, some would say the only constant is change. Imagine this manual as a living document, like the United States Constitution or a work in progress, like the Denny's menu. Most of the rules and policies can be simplified as follows: do the right thing, provide excellent care for patients, and cultivate academic curiosity. 5 Program Aims Our Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) fellowship program aims are to enable our fellows to become independent, practicing pulmonologist s/intensivist s, capable of managing patients in a variety of pulmonary and critical care clinical settings. We want to instill in our fellows the value of on -going scholarship (regardless of career goals) by developing research projects locally and exposure to national professional organizations (such as the American Thoracic Society and the American C ollege of Chest Physicians) . We will accomplish our aims through the 3 -year curriculum with focus on medical knowledge and patient care in our clinical settings, communication skills development, practice -based learning and improvements, systems- based prac tice, and professionalism. Experience will be gained with a focus on patient care in all settings: outpatient, inpatient consultations, and the intensive care unit. Outpatient clinics include continuity clinic (general pulmonology) as well as sub -specialt y clinics of sleep medicine, thoracic oncology, adult cystic fibrosis , interstitial lung disease, severe COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and ALS clinic s. Our fellows are required to do fellow -driven research, patient safety , and quality improvement projects. The fellows will participate in daily conferences designed to enhance general pulmonary and critical care medical knowledge and current topic reviews with faculty. Our fellows gain exposure to the medically underserved population by participation in our c linical and hospital settings. Core Competencies Per the ACGME, there are 6 core competencies: patient care, medical knowledge, practice - based learning and improvement, interpersonal communication skills, professionalism, and systems- based practice. Fellows are expected to be competent in all of these areas. Patient care: provide compassionate, appropriate, and effective care to patients. Medical knowledge: demonstrate knowledge of the relevant established and evolving sciences and be able to apply this knowledge to patient care. Practice -based learning and improvement: know limits in understanding, set goals to improve, incorporate feedback, reference medical literature, and educate others (patients, families, residents) Interpersonal communication skills: effectively exchange information and collaborate with patients, families, and health professionals; lead teams and maintain timely records Professionalism: Carry out responsibilities and adhere to ethical principles Systems -based practice: Recognize the larger context and system of health car e, optimize use of available resources, cost awareness, advocate for quality of care For the full ACGME document: rotations: Medical ICU (2 months) , Night Float (2 separate half -month blocks) /Pulmonary Ambulatory Clinic Service (2 sep arate half -month blocks), Pulmonary Consults (2 months) , and the Veteran's Affairs Medical Center in Clarksburg (1 month) These are required rotations comprising 7 months of the year, and vacation is to be avoided. For an example, here is how the 2021 - 2022 monthly schedule worked: For the 2022 - 2023 year, we plan to start a 3 rd MICU team and will incorporate the new critical care fellows into the call schedule. Electives are one month in duration, and taking vacation is encouraged. Fellows do not take off-service call during electives, as they are still participating in MICU weekend coverage. Fellows will participate in general pulmonary clinic 2 half days/week during electives to maintain continuity Non -medical ICU electives (must complete 3 over the course of training): Surgical ICU, Neuro -critical care, Cardiovascular ICU Other required electives: sleep medicine, thoracic surgery, and research Optional electives: anesthesia, LTACH, PFT lab, lung transplant (at the Cleveland Clinic), ED ultrasound, chest radiology, cardiology/advanced heart failure, pathology, and more! -fellowship/conferences / The didactic curriculum is an area that is frequently updated. Pay attention to e -mails from the Program Manager who will send out monthly calendars with the latest schedule. The didactic calendar will also be uploaded to the Pulm -CCM Microsoft Outloo k calendar which all fellows will be given access to upon starting. This calendar reflects any real time changes throughout the month. You will have a lot of learning opportunities. A typical month will feature combined conferences with radiology and pathology, ICU morbidity & mortality, separate pulmonary and critical care journal clubs, research conference, 2 combined lectures with the internal medicine residents, as well as weekly conferences of ICU sign out, pulmonary case discussion, and thoracic tumor board. Lectures are a mix of group discussions, fellow -led presentations, and faculty -led presentations. We are actively exploring better ways to educate, and plan on starting a Jeopardy -style quiz game to reinforce learning. Additionally, we host notable speakers from outside of the institution for a Fab 5 lecture series (around 5/year). Conference Attendance Policy: The educational conferences are important. The planned didactics exceed the minimum requirement for conference -based educational e xperience. All fellows are required to attend at least 80% of the conferences. Most conferences are from 12 PM to 1 PM Monday through Friday. The conference schedule runs on an 18 month cycle, so lectures are repeated 2x over a 3 year training period. Check e -mail for an updated conference schedule each month. Any changes will also be communicated. Conferences are led by fellows and academic faculty. Poor conference attendance will be reviewed by the Program Director. Exceptions to conference a ttendance : urgent patient care issues, time off (vacation, pre - call, post -call, or night float obligation), or external conference attendance (regional or national meetings) Faculty should avoid scheduling procedures during the noon hour when possible. If this cannot be avoided, faculty should make an effort to send fellows to conference and complete the procedure themselves. 8 Recruitment/ Selection https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/365688/criteria -for-appointment.pdf Policy: The selection of fellows is done by the Program Director in conjunction with the section faculty. Selection criteria for eligible candidates is in accordance with the GME polic ies of our institution. Eligibility for applicants must include : complet ion of residency training in an AC GME approved Internal Medicine program and meeting all GME requirements. Applications are received through the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). Applications are screened by the faculty in the section, especially the Program Director and Associate Program Director. Interviews are offered through an email from the Program Director. On the day of the interview, the candidate m eets with the Program Director for an overview of the program, and then will go through an interview process with different faculty members +/ - fellows. Following the interviews, the relevant faculty members will complete an evaluation form. The fellowship Program Ma nager will compile the evaluation forms and a rank list (NRMP) will be generated after thorough discussion during a rank order meeting with section faculty and fellows. Interviews typically run from late August to early November. Evaluations and Milestone s 1. Each fellow will be evaluated by faculty, nursing staff and/or patients monthly after each clinical rotation . Additional peer evaluations will occur at least annually. The evaluations assess the core competencies previously described above. 2. Each fellow will complete an evaluation of each faculty member and of each rotation via the E -value system. Con fidentiality will be maintained. The information contained in these evaluations is reviewed by the Program Director and shared with the faculty in annual evaluations. 3. Each fellow will self -evaluate semi- annually. 4. Each fellow and faculty member will evaluate the program as a whole annually. 5. Each fellow will meet with the PD Associate PD semi -annually to formally review progress. Core competencies, didactic attendance, licensure, scholarly activity, duty hour concerns, moonlighting , and supervision will b e discussed. 6. The Clinical Competency Committee will meet twice per year for semi- annual milestone evaluation of the fellows 9 7. The P D and APD will be available for additional discussion of a fellow's progress. Each fellow is strongly encouraged to seek the guidance for any perceived difficulty or problem. 8. At the conclusion of training , a formal written final evaluation will be completed by the PD and maintained in the fellow's permanent file. This evaluation will summarize the fellow's years of training and verify that the fellow has demonstrated sufficient professional ability to proceed. 9. The fellow will have access to his academic file and evaluations. 10. All evaluations assigned are requested to be completed in a timely manner (within two weeks). Evaluati ons will include the core competencies, as outlined by the ACGME. Here is an example showing the options in an evaluation, with a spectrum of choices spanning \"critical deficiencies\" to \"aspirational.\" ACGME Milestone Evaluation -Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care Medicine Patient Care Not Yet Completed Level 1 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5 Not Yet Assessable Patient Care 1: History and Physical Examination Patient Care 2: Disease Management in Critical Care Patient Care 3: Disease Management in Pulmonary Medicine Patient Care 4: Pre-Procedure Assessment Patient Care 5: Procedures (Invasive and Non-Invasive) Medical Knowledge Not Yet Completed Level 1 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5 Not Yet Assessable Medical Knowledge 1: Clinical Reasoning Medical Knowledge 2: Scientific Knowledge of Disease and Therapeutics 10 Systems -Based Practice Not Yet Completed Level 1 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5 Systems -Based Practice 1: Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Systems -Based Practice 2: Coordination and Transition of Care Systems -Based Practice 3: Population Health Systems -Based Practice 4: Physician Role in Health Care Systems Practice -Based Learning and Improvement Not Yet Completed Level 1 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5 Practice -Based Learning and Improvement 1: Evidence - Based and Informed Practice Practice -Based Learning and Improvement 2: Reflective Practice and Commitment to Personal Growth Professionalism Not Yet Completed Level 1 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5 Professionalism 1: Professional Behavior and Ethical Principles Professionalism 2: Accountability Professionalism 3: Well -Being and Resiliency Interpersonal and Communication Skills Not Yet Completed Level 1 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5 Interpersonal and Communication Skills 1: Patient - and Family -Centered Communication Interpersonal and Communication Skills 2: Interprofessional and Team Communication Interpersonal and Communication Skills 3: Communication within Health Care Systems Interpersonal and Communication Skills 4: Complex Communication Around Serious Illness 11 Patient Safety https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/365700/patient- safety.pdf The fellowship requires that fellows report all patient safety issues including events affecting the quality of care pr ovided to patients, morbidity events, and near miss incident. The goal is to prevent future recurrences and create a safer working environment. To complete a report, go to the following website and submit the relevant information: http://connect.wvuhealthcare.com/safety -reports/home Program Evaluation Committee (PEC) The PEC meets 2x/year to evaluate the training program with a goal of improving the education and experience. Fellows are invited to attend the meetings to communicate their impressions. Policy: The PEC exists to participate in the development of the program's curriculum and related learning activities , assess the effectiveness of that curriculum, and identify ac tions needed to improve or correct (in -line with ACGME standards). Members of the PEC include the PD, APD, fellows (at least 1 per year) and other section faculty (all are encouraged to participate) The PEC will formally document an Annual Program Evaluation (APE) between late May and early June Program evaluations to be distributed through E -Value In addition to evaluations, additional data to be reviewed includes: case logs, involvement in hospital and departmental improvement/safety initiatives, scholarly activity, patient satisfaction, graduate performance, faculty development, mentoring, and an assessment of program strengths and weaknesses Based on the information and discussion, the Committee will prepare an action plan to document plans to improve fellow performance, faculty development, graduate performance, program quality, and update on the previous year's action plan The final report/action plan will be provided to the GME committee. Documentation Timely, clearly -worded documentation is essenti al in pulmonary and critical care. It aids in communication with other providers, documents a plan of care (patient safety implications), and is the basis for billing. The general policy is that notes on inpatients or for any procedures should be completed on the same day, notes for outpatients should be completed within 1 week. 12 Procedures Beyond the documentation within the medical record, it is also important for fellows to log procedures into the E -Value system. This should be done monthly at a minim um, but is easier to keep track of if done daily. This log is important for the PD when assessing the fellow's procedural skills. Many institutions will need documentation of a minimum number of certain procedures for credentialing purposes as well. Before performing a procedure, the fellow will discuss it with their attending. Direct supervision and instructional education will be provided until competency in the procedure is established. Even if supervision is not required, it is encouraged to call for help with difficult cases. First year fellows will perform arterial and central lines under supervision until competency in the performance of the procedure is observed. Thereafter, the first year fellow will be able to perform these procedures o n his own. All fellows are required to have direct attending supervision for thoracentesis and chest tube insertion. Once competent, the fellow will be able to perform them on their own in urgent/emergent situations when the attending is not physically available. All fellows will need the physical presence of an attending to pe rform endotracheal intubations and bronchoscopi es. In order to complete the fellowship requirements, all fellows must have performe d at least 100 bronchoscopies under direct attending supervision . Fellows will maintain a detailed log of procedures, including advanced bronchoscopies and moderate sedation. Transitions of Care https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/365673/handoffsandtransitionsofcare2017logo.pdf 1. Out-patient service - not required. If a fellow is going to miss time, all patient information is maintained in the chart for cross coverage purposes. As noted in the section on vacation/leave, with advanced notice of time off, the clinics can be rescheduled. 13 2. In-patient service a. Daily sign-in and s ign-out i. There must be a formal sign out daily by each resident on an inpatient service. This includes direct communication ii. Fellows must directly sign out their patients to the night float fellow, along with a written sign -out. This should include: name, age, sex, room, relevant diagnoses , active problems , code status , and f ollow up/required actions iii. Residents that are post -call must communicate the events of the preceding night to the fellows coming on that day. This should include new admissions and significant updates. b. Transfer to another Level of Care i. When a patient is transferred from one level of care to another, e.g. the wards to the ICU, there must be documented communication between fellow physicians that includes the summarized , relevant information to provide effective care. ii. The fellow that \"se nds\" the patient to the service providing a different level of care must write a note that summarizes the clinical events preceding the transfer, and should also communicate verbally . c. End of Rotation i. On completion of an inpatient rotation, the fellow physi cian must communicate with the fellow physician that is coming on service to assume the care of his or her patients. This will ensure that each patient on the service continues to receive continuous, high quality care without interruption. ii. Communication should include an off- service note written by the fellow rotating off service. Communication should also include a face -to-face hand off that provides an opportunity to discuss each patient and allow questions and clarification of any issues. Promotion/ Dismissal The intention of the program is to promote all fellows whose performance has been entirely satisfactory. After a minimum of one -half of the current appointment (6 months) , the performance of the fellow will be reviewed by the PD or APD . Compiled evaluation reports from E-Value as well as any other documentation in the fellow's file will be reviewed in the context of the fellow's entire academic record. Fellows will be reappointed only when their Core Competencies are evaluated as satisfactory. If the fellow fails to meet criteria for reappointment, the fellow's file will be reviewed and presented to the Academic & Professional Standards Subcommittee. 14 The subcommittee's recommendation regarding reappointment will be passed to the Department Chairma n who will make a final decision and notify the resident promptly. Should the decision be for non- renewal, the fellow may respond either in writing or in person to the PD. If the results are still unsatisfactory to the fellow, the fellow may request to hav e the decision reviewed by the following, sequentially: 1. Department of Medicine Advisory Committee 2. WVU School of Medicine Associate Dean for Graduate Medical Programs 3. Health Science Center Committee on Graduate Medical Education Promotion 1. Fellows are promoted if they receive satisfactory evaluations in each of the portions of their evaluations for each rotation. 2. If an unsatisfactory evaluation is received , then the fellow will meet with the PD to explore the reasons for the suboptimal performance. A plan will be crafted to accomplish satisfactory performance on subsequent rotations. 3. If unsatisfactory performance is demonstrated on subsequent rotations , then policies for probation (outlined below) are implemented. Initial Probation If, af ter documented counseling, a fellow is not performing at an adequate level of competence, demonstrates unprofessional or unethical behavior, engages in misconduct, or otherwise fails to fulfill the responsibilities of the program in which he/she is enrolle d, the fellow may be placed on probation by the PD or education committee. The fellow must be informed in person of this decision and must be provided with a probation document which includes the following: 1. A statement of the grounds for probation, includ ing identified deficiencies or problem behaviors; 2. The duration of probation which, ordinarily, will be at least three months; 3. A plan for remediation and criteria by which successful remediation will be judged; 4. Notice that failure to meet the conditions of probation could result in extended probation, additional training time, and/or suspension or dismissal from the program durin g or at the conclusion of the probationary period and; 5. Written acknowledgement by the fellow of the receipt of the probation document. Extended Probation: The status of a fellow on probation should be evaluated periodically, preferably every three months , but at a minimum, every six months. If, at the end of the initial period of probation, the fellow's performance remains unsatisfactory, probation either may be extended in accordance with the above guidelines ( Initial Probation 1-5) or the fellow may be suspended or dismissed from the program. Probationary actions must be reported to the Graduate Medical Education (GME) Office, and probation documents must be forwarded to the GME Office for review before they are issued. 15 Suspension and Dismissal: A fellow may be suspended from clinical activities by his or her PD , department chair, or by the faculty director of the clinical area to which the fellow is assigned. This action may be taken in any situation in which continuation of clinical activities by the fellow is deemed potentially detrimental or threatening to patient safety or the quality of patient care. Unless otherwise directed, a fellow suspended from clinical activities may participate in other program activities. A decision involving suspension of clinical activities of a fellow must be reviewed within three working days by the department chair (or his or her designee) to determine if the fellow may return to clinical activities, and/or whether further actions is warranted (including, but not limit ed to, counseling, probation, fitness for duty evaluation, or summary dismissal). Program Suspension: A fellow may be suspended from all program activities and duties by his or her program director, department chair, the Associate Dean for Clinical Activ ities or Graduate Medical Education, or the Dean of the School of Medicine. Program suspension may be imposed for conduct that is deemed to be grossly unprofessional, incompetent, erratic, potentially criminal, or threatening to the well- being of patients, staff, or the fellow. A decision involving program suspension of a fellow must be reviewed within three working days by the department chair (or his or her designee) to determine if the fellow may return to some or all program activities and duties and/or whether further action is warranted (including, but not limited to, counseling, probation, fitness for duty evaluation, or summary dismissal). Dismissal During or at the Conclusion of Probation: Probationary status in a fellowship program constitutes no tification to the fellow that dismissal from the program can occur at any time (i.e., during or at the conclusion of probation). Dismissal prior to the conclusion of a probationary period may occur if conduct, which gave rise to probation, is repeated or if grounds for Program Suspension or Summary Dismissal exist. Dismissal at the end of a probationary period may occur if the fellow's performance remains unsatisfactory or for any of the foregoing reasons, prior to dismissal, the GME office must be notified of any dismissal of any fellowship during or at the conclusion of a probationary period. Summary Dismissal: For serious acts of incompetence, impairment, or unprofessional behavior, a department chair may immediately suspend a fellow from all program ac tivities and duties for a minimum of three days and, concurrently, issue a notice of dismissal effective at the end of the suspension period. The fellow does not need to be on probation, nor at the end of a probationary period, for this action to be taken. The fellow must be notified in writing of the reason for suspension and dismissal, have an opportunity to respond to the action before the dismissal is effective and be given a copy of the GME Appeals Process. Prior to dismissal the GME office must be notified of any dismissal of any fellowship during or at the conclusion of a probationary period . 16 Grievance Procedure : Fellow is encouraged to seek resolution of grievances relating to fellow's appointment or responsibilities, including any differences betwe en fellow and WVUH, the Institute or WVU with respect to the interpretation of, application of, or compliance with the provision of the agreement, in accordance with the grievance procedures set forth on the WVU website https://grievanceprocedure.wvu.edu/ Forms and procedures are available from the Human Resources Department located on the ground floor of the Health Sciences Center, North. Condition for Reappointment : 1. Promotion : Decisions regarding resident promotion are based on criteria listed above, and whether fellow has met all departmental requirements. 2. Intent Not to Renew Contract : In the event that WVU School of Medicine elects not to reappoint a fellow to the program and the agreement is not renewed, the program director shall provide the fellow with a four (4) month advance written notice of its determination of non -reappointment unless the termination is \"for cause.\" The GME Office must also be notified in writing. Intent not to renew is subject to academic grievance . 3. Intent Not to Promote to the Next Level of Training : In the event the WVU School of Medicine GME program elects not to advance or promote a fellow to the next level of training, the Program Director shall notify the resident with at least four (4) months advance written notice of said intent unless the cause for non- promotion occurs during the final four months of the contact period. The GME Office must also be notified in writing. Intent not to promote is subject to academic grievance . Research Research drives the science of medicine! The best research often starts with a curious spirit (What kind of webs would spiders weave if we gave them different drugs?), and the fellowship program aims to encourage scholarly activity in the pursuit of knowledge. There are many opportunities for research : By the end of the 1st year of training, fellows will choose a faculty mentor and join an ongoing project or develop a new study . Developing the skills to write a research manuscript is expected. Within 3 years of fellowship, participation in a quality improvement project is also expected (this can be a shared effort). Submission of at least 1 interesting case report/series or original research is require d for local or national professional meeti ngs (such as ATS, CHEST, SCCM, ACP...). More submissions are encouraged. WVU hosts a Resident Research Day where participation is strongly encouraged as well. 17 Collaboration with National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health or basic scientists at WVU Regularly occurring pulmonary and critical care research conference to help focus on goals. And much more! Quality Improvement This is a major point of emphasis \u2014review of health systems and a plan to improve the quality of care. Quality improvement can apply to almost any process and can be \"low -hanging fruit\" for research. Lifelong learning. https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/365674/healthcare -quality -policy.pdf 1. Fellows will continue to evaluate, critique , and develop educational presentations for monthly Morbidity and Mortality conference. Every month the presentations include personal reflection on quality of care provided as well as the ability to evaluate suboptimal outcomes . 2. All fellows will develop and complete a quality improvement project that meets the following criteria: a. The project will have the goal of improving the quality of care provided and/or increasing patient safety measures by the individual provider or a larger component of the health care system b. The project must include oversight by a faculty member c. This project will include data to validate improvement (or lack thereof). d. The project must be completed one month prior to the completion of fellowship and the fellow should have defined the project by mid- point of their training. e. The project should be of publishable quality, and may meet the requirements for the senior academic project. Supervision With any questions, fellows are encouraged to check with their supervising faculty. Retaliation upon, or derogatory statements mad e to, a trainee requesting help/supervision is never acceptable and will not be tolerated. https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/365696/supervision -policy.pdf 18 Supervision of Residents The fellows have a role in the supervision of residents and medical students rotating on pulmonary consult and Medical ICU services. In conjunction with the attending physicians, the fellows are responsible for the teaching and supervision of internal medicine residents or residents from other specialties (Family Medicine, Anesthesiology, and Emergency Medicine ); as well as medical students on clinical rotations . MICU: All patients mu st be seen and examined by the fellow. The fellow will lea d the initial orientation of residents and medical students on the 1 st day of the rotation. Fellows will explain the daily schedule and the dynamic of the service to the trainees. Expectations of the rotation will be outlined. Residents and medical studen ts will be made aware of the available Critical Care textbooks and how to get access to educational computer -based medical programs (Up - to-Date, PubMed, ACCP/ATS web sites ). Fellows will guide and supervise residents and medical students in the preparation of daily rounds. The fellow will advise them in the diagnostic work - up orders and management decisions. The fellow will discuss the evolution of patients, physical findings, laboratory results, and radiographic studies. Fellows will discuss any potential invasive procedure with the trainee s: indications and potential complications. Fellows will supervise any procedure p erformed by residents and medical students in the Unit and will ascertain that proper documentation of the procedure is placed i n the medical record. Fellows will give continuous feedback to the residents and medical students on their performance. During and at the end of the rotation, the fellow will give input to the attending physician on the residents and medical students' per formance which will contribute to their monthly evaluations. Pulmonary consult s ervice : All patients must been seen and examined by the fellow. In the pulmonary consult s ervice, the fellow's role as a teacher and supervisor is also essential in the educa tion of residents and medical students rotating on the service. Once again, the fellow will participate in the initial orientation of residents and medical students. The goals and objectives of the rotation will be reviewed. The fellow will explain the dai ly schedule and the dynamic of the service. The fellows will discuss with the trainees the diagnostic work -up; participate in formulating a treatment and management plans. Fellows will help the residents and medical students to prepare the case for presentation to the attending physician. Fellows, together with the attending physician assigned to the service, will provide reading material and will instruct the residents and medical students in the interpretation of pulmonary functions studies and radiologic al imaging. Fellows will give continuous feedback to the residents and medical students during their rotation. Also, fellows will give input on the residents and medical students to the attending and these contributions are used for the residents and medical students' evaluations 19 Supervision of Fellows Policy on Supervision and Responsibilities : 1. Role of the Attending: a. Faculty and fellows should inform the patients of their role in each patient's care. b. Ultimate responsibility for patient care decisions fall on the attending c. Faculty is expected to respond fully and respectfully to any questions or concerns expressed by the care team, including residents and fellows 24/7. d. Faculty supervision should be of sufficient duration to assess the knowledge and skills of each fellow and delegate the appropriated level of authority and responsibility. e. At a minimum, the fellow should notify the attending of significant changes in the patient's condition, such as need for > 2 vasopressors, possibility o f brain death, severe ARDS, or inability to oxygenate/ventilate. 2. Levels of Supervision of fellows by faculty: a. Direct Supervision - faculty is physically present with the fellow, resident and patient. b. Indirect Supervision - (direct supervision immediately available) Supervising physician is not physically present within the hospital or other site of care, but is immediately available by means of telephonic and/or electronic modalities, and is available to provide direct supervision to fellows and residents. c. Oversight - Supervising physician is available to provide reviews of procedures and or encounters with feedback provided after care is delivered. 3. Role of the f ellow: a. To supervise the medical residents in the clinical care of patients. b. To understand the medical plan for each patient c. To manage the team as a whole including allotment of patients based on individual resident workload and performance. d. Making sure all residents are available and participate during rounds e. To communicate clearly to the attending of record as designated f. To enhance teaching on this service by organizing presentations and the case conferences. g. Present during the \"check out rounds\". h. Help arrange for few select conferences (teaching on ICU topics) for MICU resident on monthly basis. 4. Fellow on call (Night Float Fellow): a. To supervise the admission, diagnostic evaluation and treatm ent of newly admitted patients b. To communicate with the attending of record as designated c. To oversee care of all inpatients 20 d. To support/supervise the residents on MICU team as they manage both newly admitted and existing inpatients Important to remember Calling for help/supervision is NOT a sign of weakness Ideal supervision will optimize patient care as well as resident educa tion Do not hesitate to contact the attending for any major issue or a problem Vacation/ Leave Please take vacation, it is important for your health and wellness. Vacation time should be planned for elective months. You accrue 2 days of vacation per mon th plus additional days for working on certain holidays. You stop accumulating vacation days at 24, which does carry over year to year. The biggest caveat is to request the time off with adequate advance planning \u2014ideally 3 months to allow for clinic cancellation. When taking time off, be sure to arrange for another co -fellow to cover your in -basket. https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/365677/annual -leave -policy.pdf Welln ess Wellness -the act of practicing healthy habits on a regular basis to attain better physical and mental health. Instead of just surviving, truly thriving. The opposite of burn out. Fellow wellness deserves more space than what can be included in this manual and takes different forms for different people. Please spend time away from the hospital and around friends and family whenever possible. West Virginia has some beautiful outdoor recreation including: Cooper's Rock State Park (just outside of Morgantown), the newest National Park \u2014the New River Gorge, multiple ski resorts, white water rafting, hiking trails, and regional festivals. All 1 st year fellows are required to attend a session with the WVU Fac ulty and Staff Assistance Program. If this is a productive session, additional appointments can be scheduled. The critical care faculty participate on a regular basis. When possible, we plan several wellness events during the year for the section. Past events include Zero -hour (an after work hang out at a restaurant with goal for breaking down traditional barriers), catered fellow lunches, various celebrations (baby showers, retirement parties), outdoor cook -outs, and much more! https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/365698/well -being -policy.pdf 21 Rotations This section is intended to serve as an overview of the various rotations that comprise the pulmonary and critical care fellowship. Individual rotations may vary at the discretion of the attending physician and changes in workload. https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/medicine/sections -of-medicine/pulmonary -critical- have d etailed expectations. For core rotations, the expectations and evaluations change according to post -graduate year. Evaluations of fellow performance are requested at the end of the rotation via E -Value, broken down in accordance to the core competencies. See also the section on ACGME Milestones. Faculty are encouraged to give direct feedback on a weekly basis (Feedback Friday). An annual in -training exam (ITE) is also proctored to assess medical knowledge in specific areas. Core Rotations The bread and butter of pulmonary and critical care: these rotations will make up at least half of each year of fellowship: Medical ICU, pulmonary consults, VA Medical Center (includes clinic and consults), PACS, and night float. Medical ICU Ruby Memorial feature s a robust medical ICU, currently divided into 2 teaching services (MICU 1 and MICU 2) with a roughly equal distribution of patients. In fall of 2022, we plan to launch a 3 rd MICU team, which was previously opened to deal with local surges in COVID -19. During the day, faculty will triage admissions to the ICU from external hospitals. The fellows on service will take transfer calls from within Ruby Memorial and the Emergency Department. Decisions on admission, diagnostic work up, consultations, and transfers will completely rest on the MICU team. After discussion with the attending physician, the MICU fellow will be responsible for discharging patients from the unit. The attending physician will be available 24 hours per day to discuss any issue pertinent to the service. The MICU team is formed by an attending physician, a fellow, 3 -5 resident, possibly a medical student, a pharmacist, and a dietician. Bedside nurses and res piratory therapists will join rounds for their specific patients. Morning rounds typically start at 9 AM, the attending will notify you if there is a change here. Prior to rounds, the fellow is expected to have examined the patients, reviewed new data, a nd imaging before formal rounds start. Furthermore, any 22 new patient admitted during the night, and all night time events will have already been reviewed by the fellow. The day -plan for each patient will be discussed and established. Following rounds, a progress note is written on each patient and new orders given (notes are written by the residents unless otherwise specified). The MICU fellow will supervise the care of each patient and ascertain that the plan for every patient is followed through. All required invasive MICU procedures are performed under attending supervision. The fellow will also interact with respiratory therapists in the management of ventilators, with the dietitian in the nutritional management of the patients, and with the differ ent consultation services. The trainee will also be assisted by the pharmacist in the use of different medications related to ICU care. The trainee will also participate in discussions related to end -of-life decisions with patients and their families, and will be instructed in ethical issues. Every weekday afternoon, around 4 p.m., the ICU team will again make rounds to review events from the day and any changes in patient status. This is often fellow -led, with a verbal check out with the attending. These r ounds are especially important to prepare for the night float team. The ICU fellow will provide information to the on -call fellow (the daytime ICU fellows alternate as \"late stay\" after 5 PM until the night float fellow arrives at 7 PM) for cross coverage purposes, before giving a sign out to the night float fellow at 7 PM. The trainees will als o have the opportunity for post- ICU follow -up care on the pulmonary consult service.

There may be residents and students as well, but not always. During this rotation, fellow s will learn many aspect s of inpatient pulmonary medicine. The consult team is listed in the call schedule from 8 AM to 5 PM, but the daily schedule may vary depending on scheduling of procedures and the availability of the attending physician for daily rounds. Fellows are expected to evaluat e all patients and supervise the residents in their evaluation of patients. Presentations should include detailed relevant history, pertinent physical exam findings, extent of respiratory support when applicable, PFT's (if available), and chest imaging. Following rounds, recommendations will be given to the patient's primary service. If necessary, the patient is evaluated on a daily basis by the trainee with input from the attending physician. The patient is followed until it is deemed unnecessary to continue follow- up care. This rotation allows the fellow to observe the expertise and bedside manners of a clinician experienced in the diagnosis and management of respiratory diseases, whether the disease is primary to the lung or secondary to a systemic illness. In addition, the fellow will develop capacity to interact with members of other services at a consultant level, and learn to synthesize all information pertinent to the respiratory system.

Clarksburg VA Medical Center The Clarksburg VA rotation features two very experienced pulmonologists with a lot to offer, Drs. Prasoon Jain and Prasad Devabhaktuni. Both like to teach. Clarksburg is about an hour's drive south of Morgantown. Clinical exposure includes inpatient consults and outpatient pulmonary and sleep clinics. The rotatio n is weekdays except Tuesday, when the VA fellow will attend thoracic oncology and general pulmonology clinics in Morgantown, WV. The trainee will evaluate patients admitted to the Pulmonary Service and present them to the attending physician who will dis cuss in detail the patient's history, physical examination, diagnosis and management. There are daily bedside rounds, and the attending physician is always available for the fellow. The fellow will perform bronchoscopies and read pulmonary function tests under the supervision of the attending physician. Pulmonary Ambulatory Clinic Service (PACS) Each trainee will spend time covering the PACS rotation. Often, it is combined with night float to break up the month, but other times it is assigned as a primary rotation. Some months may have 2 fellows on PACS. Most of the clinics are located in the Physician's Office Center (POC) building located next to the main hospital. General pulmonary clinic will expose t rainees to patients with various respiratory di seases . Each patien t seen in clinic by the trainee, then presented to the attending physician ( will be physically present during clinic hours ), and then the patient will be seen in conjunction with the attending . 32 While on PACS, fellows will have three half days of continuity clinic. Sub -specialty clinics are also part of the rotation \u2014thoracic oncology clinic Tuesday mornings at the cancer center, interstitial lung disease clinic Wednesday afternoons, sleep medicine and pulmonary hypertension on Thursday mornings, ALS in the neurology clinic 1 -2x/month, and cystic fibrosis clinic Friday mornings 2 -3x/month. Additional sub- specialty clinics of post -COVID -19, severe COPD, muscular dystrophy, or severe asthma may develop in the near future. The PACS fellow is also responsible for administering and interpreting cardiopulmonary exercise testing in the PFT lab on Monday mornings (if not in clinic at the time) and presenting a lecture at noon towards the end of the month (PACS lecture). The PACS fellow should also attend Thoracic Tumor Board to discuss relevant patients on Tuesdays at 4 PM. Night Float The night float service allows for in- house coverage at night, with a fellow on site in the medical ICU (call room is provided). The night float fellow is in charge of assisting with coverage for all of the medical ICU patients, triaging transfers from the floor, ED, and outside hospitals, and overseeing/performing ICU procedures. Many fellows enjoy this rotation due to the autonomy. Additional support in the ICU typically includes a senior resident from the ICU service (who fields most phone calls in cross coverage) and another back up resident. With times of increased ICU census, sometimes there is a third resident also present at night. Call runs from 7 PM to 7 AM, Saturday through Thursday night\u2014 allowing for 6 days of work with Friday nights off. This rotation is usually for half of a given month, split with PACS. Friday nights are covered by 1 of the weekend call fellows (see Call section of manual) . Electives Calling non -core rotations \"elective\" is somewhat misleading because many of them are required. Electives can be repeated as long as the required electives are fulfilled. For fellows on elective, they will continue to s pend two half days pe r week in the Pulmonary Clinic for continuity of care. 33 Sleep Medicine Sleep topics represent a significant portion of the pulmonary boards. It is a required elective for at least one month of fellowship, but if there is a strong clinical interest it can be repeated. Additionally, WVU does have a sleep fellowship. There is a regularly occurring sleep clinic on Thursday mornings at the POC, but on sleep elective the fellow will also participate in sleep clinic at the off -site sleep lab, learn to interpret PSG's, and evaluate inpatient sleep consults at Ruby Memorial. The go al of the rotation is to gain familiarity with the different aspects of sleep medicine. During the rotation, the fellow will gain expertise in respiratory and non -respiratory disorders causing disturbance of sleep. The fellow will interact with the sleep laboratory technician s and the sleep medicine attending to gain insight of the different laboratory procedures, and the interpretation of sleep studies. Trainees will be able to observe a sleep studies and gain knowledge in the sleep laboratory equipment. Learning about the different pharmacologic treatment and mechanical devices used in the treatment sleep disturbances is also a goal of this rotation. Research As above, there is a research requirement for completion of the fellowship. The research mont h should not be scheduled without an IRB approved project. If there is a strong clinical interest and record of productive research, this elective can be repeated. Thoracic surgery Ruby Memorial features a robust group of thoracic surgeons. The chief o f their section is Dr. Ghulam Abbas. The goal of this rotation is for fellows to learn more about specific lung surgeries, pre -operative evaluation for surgical patients, post -operative management of common thoracic diseases, chest tube insertion/manageme nt, and to enhance collaboration with our surgical colleagues. Days usually start early with rounds (8SE workroom) before heading to the OR at 7 AM. Fellows can select cases they find particularly interesting to assist. Fellows are expected to participate in thoracic oncology clinic in the cancer center as well as Thoracic Tumor Board as part of the rotation. The population of patients that will be involved in the rotation includes: outpatient thoracic oncology patients, preoperative/postoperative patients, consults on hospitalized patients, as well patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. 34 Objectives: Common thoracic surgical procedures o Pulmonary biopsies (mediastinoscopy, rigid bronchoscopy, EBUS, lung tracheostomy placement o Tracheal stenting or Laser therapy The rationale for the selection of appropriate surgical candidates Preoperative and postoperative management of t horacic surgical patients Diagnosis an d surgical management of lung malignancies Chest Tube Management ECMO cannulation The c linical team will include all or some of the following: tho racic surgeons , thoracic surgery fellow, general surgery residents, PA, NP Patient care Fellows must be ab le to provide patient care that is compassionate, appropriate, and effective for the treatment of critical care problems.

Post -operative pain management of thoracic surgical patients 35 Practice -based l earning and i mprovement Fellows must exhibit a commitment to investigation and evaluation of one's own patient care as well as appraisal and assimilation of scientific evidence and improvements in patient care. This can be accomplished through regular participation in fellow -level journal clubs and through Quality Improvement projects such as Root Cause Analysis of cases or participation in Morbidity and Mortality conference. Interpersonal and communication s kills Fellows must demonstrate interpersonal and communication skills that result in the effective exchange of information and collaboration with patients, their families, and health professional. This can be demonstrated in the ability to apply understanding of family dynamics in discussions with patients and families regarding complex medial situations and decision - making, to collaborate with team members from other services (as in the co -management of ECMO patients with the cardiology service) and to effective ly supervise and manage the care of patients by nurses, physician assistants, and residents in an appropriate yet collegial manner. Fellows can also demonstrate strong interpersonal and communication skills though regular teaching, both informal and formal, of residents and other team members. Orders on all surgical patients should be entered by the intensivist team. If a consultant requests a test or medication it should be discussed with the Thoracic Surgery team and Thoracic Surgery team will enter the order. Professionalism Fellows must demonstrate a commitment to carrying out professional responsibilities and an adherence to ethical principles. Specifically, they must skillfully address ethical issues for patients and families under the care of the Thoracic Surgery service. Fellows must also exhibit professionalism in all aspects of interaction with colleagues and other team members, behaving in a manner befitting an advanced healthcare professional. This can be exhibited by setting a tone of respect and collegiality for the healthcare team members, willingly seeing patients and families to discuss a patient's care, protecting staff, family, and patient's interests and confidentiality, and completing medical records punctually and with appropriate documentation. Systems -based practice Fellows must practice in a way that demonstrates an awareness of and responsiveness to the larger context and system of health care and the ability to effectively call on system resources to provide care that is of opt imum value. Understand the relationships of local and national health care systems and how changes to improve the system involve individual and group efforts. Optimize coordination of patient care within one's own practice. 36 The purpose of this rotation is education . Continuous learning, using up -to-date medical evidence, in the case of patients with diseases or disorders amenable to surgical approach. Understand the risk, benefits, indications and contraindications of thoracic surgery procedures . Trainees will receive formal feedback. Fellows will be excused from the thoracic surgery to attend fellow's own continuity clinic and conferences that take place as part of their fellowship. Fellows will go back to thoracic surgery after clinics to fin ish their shift. Fellows must inform the thoracic surgery staff physicians about the vacations and other commitments like clinics and conferences at the start of the rotation. Fellows must attend half of working days in a month (can include weekends) to ge t the credit for the elective month (approx. 100 hrs.) Non-medical ICU's For completion of the fellowship, a total of 3 months of training in non -medical ICU's is required. Thoracic surgery may count as 1 of the ICU months. For these rotations, fellows are not expected to take call as they are still participating in call for the medical ICU. Cardiovascular ICU This experience will allow the fellow to gain experience in treating patients with acute cardiac diseases. The CVICU is staffed by several diffe rent medical intensivists and conducts multidisciplinary rounds similar to the MICU. Drs. Paul McCarthy and Ankit Sakhuja are the co - directors. Goals for the rotation: directly participate in the care of the C VICU patients, gain insight in the approach t o acute coronary diseases, cardiac arrhythmias, and indications for invasive cardiac procedures. The fellow will also see many post -operative patients following cardiac or thoracic surgeries. Special attention should be given to acquiring and interpreting bedside Echo studies, performing right heart catheterization, EKG interpretation, and any advanced cardiac life support (IABP, ECMO). For senior fellows in good standing, there are often moonlighting opportunities related to CVICU coverage. Duty hours a re typically 6 AM to 6 PM. The population of patients admitted to the CVICU includes cardiac surgery patients, thoracic surgery patients, vascular surgery patients, and cardiology patients as well patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. 37 The primary objectives of the CVICU rotation include achieving competence in the management of: cardiology patients and the postoperative care for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CBG, including off- pump CABG) cardiac valve repair/replacement (including arrhythmias, aortic thoraco grafting, carotid endarterectomy, complicated thoracic surgical cases as well as complex surgeries for patients with cardiovascular co -morbidities. In addition to achieving competence in management of patients requiring initiation of, therapy from, and weaning off of extra -corporeal membrane oxygenation (both venovenous and veno -arterial ECMO) mechanical circulatory devices such as rightand left- ventricular assist devices.

Interpersonal and c ommunication skills Fellows must demonstrate interpersonal and communication skills that result in the effective exchange of information and collaboration with patients, their families, and health professional. This can be demonstrated in the ability to apply understanding of family dynamics in discussions with patients and families reg arding complex medial situations and decision - making, to collaborate with team members from other services (as in the co -management of ECMO patients with the cardiology service) and to effectively supervise and manage the care of patients by nurses, physic ian assistants, and residents in an appropriate yet collegial manner. Fellows can also demonstrate strong interpersonal and communication skills though regular teaching, both informal and formal, of residents and other team members. 39 Orders on all surgical patients should be entered by the intensivist team. If a consultant requests a test or medication it should be discussed with the CVICU team and CVICU team will enter the order. All orders for cardiology patients should be entered by the cardiology team. For cardiology patients seen by the CVICU team as a consult, the CVICU will discuss the case with the cardiology team and make recommendations but will not write orders. Professionalism Fellows must demonstrate a commitment to carr ying out professional responsibilities and an adherence to ethical principles. Specifically, they must skillfully address ethical issues for patients and families in an adult cardiovascular surgery unit such as goals of care and end -of-life discussions. Fe llows must also exhibit professionalism in all aspects of interaction with colleagues and other team members, behaving in a manner befitting an advanced healthcare professional. This can be exhibited by setting a tone of respect and collegiality for the healthcare team members, willingly seeing patients and families to discuss a patient's care, protecting staff, family, and patient's interests and confidentiality, and completing medical records punctually and with appropriate documentation. Systems -based practice Fellows must practice in a way that demonstrates an awareness of and responsiveness to the larger context and system of health care and the ability to effectively call on system resources to provide care that is of optimum value. In the CVICU, this can be demonstrated through an understanding of resource utilization both within the hospital (which cardiac testing is appropriate, or rational use of circulatory assist devices) as well as in a larger context such as in the evaluation of potential candidates for heart transplant. Daily work flow -- The fellow will be an integral part of the team and will be viewed as a co - leader alongside the attending cardiovascular intensivist. The purpose of the rotation is fellow education and there will be some f lexibility in structure to meet the educational goals of the fellow. Fellows can manage a selected group of patients under the direction of the attending intensivist or can oversee the care of patients managed by CVICU advanced practioners. The CVICU emplo ys a shift model (6am - 6pm/6pm - 6am). Fellows are encouraged to work a mixture of days and nights. Due to the nature of critical illness there are times that shifts may extend longer than scheduled. The service respects ACGME rules and fellows are expected to adhere to duty hour rules. There is a morning report daily at 6:30am with cardiac surgery and any fellows working day shift should attend this meeting. Procedures -- Fellows will be permitted to perform procedure they are competent in on CVICU patien ts under the supervision of critical care and surgical attendings. Fellows will have the opportunity to participate in a variety of procedures including ECMO cannulation, pacemaker, placement transesophageal echocardiography, thoracic procedure and others. These opportunities will be based on clinical situations. 40 Education -- The purpose of this rotation is education. Didactic sessions will occur at least four days per week. Additionally, a weekly CVICU conference takes place on Thursday afternoon. Fellows are also encouraged to attend monthly cardiac surgery M&M, weekly cardiac surgery grand rounds, cardiology grand rounds and every other month CVICU case conference and journal club. Neuro -Critical Care Fellows are encouraged to complete a rotation in the Neuro ICU. The primary focus of this rotation will be management of patients with stroke and neurosurgical emergencies.

If they are not in the OR, please page them or meet them at the patient's bedside. During this time, you will also introduce yourself to the patient in the preoperative area and perform an airway exam. You are encouraged to remain in your assigned OR for a reasonable period of time. Hanging out in the OR will allow you to learn more about the pharmacology and physiology of IV anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking drugs, opioids, vasopressors, inotropes, and vasodilators (drugs used by all specialties). This is also the time to learn about ventilator management and become familiar with airway equipment. You are encouraged to ask questions about these topics. We are happy to teach! I understand that you are here to improve your airway management skills. If you decide to float between OR's to get intubations, you are still expected to introduce yourself to the CRNA/resident assigned to the OR that you would like to go into. You are also expected to review the patient's medical history in Epic, introduce yourself to the patient, and perform an airway exam prior to entering the operating room. When you leave your assigned OR, it will then become your responsibility to find new cases to go into. You will be provided with a list of the types of cases that frequently require intubatio ns. 51 Sleep medicine See course directors Drs. Rob Stansbury or Chris Pham for more details.

All call is in -house. Call is limited to Friday nights and weekend days. This is as evenly distributed as possible (schedule made by the chief fellow), with any slight increase in call being directed at the more junior residents. This is subject to change with projected ICU expansion. For the sake of example, under the 2 ICU system: Fellow 1 takes call from 7 PM Friday through 5 PM Saturday. During the night, Fellow 1 covers both ICU services. In the morning, Fellow 1 is responsible for just MICU 1. Fellow 2 arrives Saturday morning and assumes care for MICU 2 and sees consults . Fellow 2 c ross covers MICU 1 f rom 5 PM to 7 PM so Fellow 1 can have enough time off between shifts. On Sunday, both weekend fellows are present during the day. On Monday, both Fellow 1 and Fellow 2 return to their regularly scheduled rotation. Fellows on ICU service for the month are usually not assigned weekend call. Fellows o n MICU service on a given month will take a few hours of c overage each evening (5 PM to 7 PM) until the night float fellow arrives. This is usually on alternating days. While on call, you may get contacted by a cli nic patient or pharmacy with a prescription questio n. Try to be helpful, but if the issue is not urgent, feel free to direct it to the appropriate provider the next day. If you are unsure of what to do, please contact your faculty. On night float, you may be contacted for pulmonary consults. If the patient is critically ill, please transfer them to the ICU. You do not need to independently see consults at night, but sometime guidance by phone can prevent ICU transfer (try some BiPAP) or facilitate care (NPO order for bronchoscopy the next da y). You will also help to triage transfers to the ICU. Keep in mind that Ruby Memorial is a large referral center, and many of the outside facilities may be critical access with limited resources . As a group, our goal is to be helpful. The MARS transfe r calls are recorded , so be sure to remain professional. Clinical and Educational Work Hours ( Duty Hours ) Duty hours are defined as clinical and academic activities related to the fellowship program including both inpatient and outpatient care, administr ative responsibilities related to patient care, provision of transfer of patient care, time spent in -house doing call activity, and scheduled educational activity such as conferences. The hours, however, do not include reading time and time for preparation which is away from the duty site. Duty hours will be limited to 80 hours per week averaged over a 4 -week period, inclu sive of call. 56 The fellow must be provided one day in seven free from all educational and clinical responsibilities averaged over a 4 - week period. A day is defined as one continuous 24 -hour period free of all clinical, educational, and administrative duties. Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine fellows are off one day in seven when on clinical service and two days off in seven when on no n-clinical services including research rotations. Adequate time for rest and personal activities will be provided. This should consist of 10 -hour time period provided between all daily duty periods. Continuous on- site duty must not exceed 24 consecutive ho urs. Fellows may remain on duty up to six additional hours to participate in didactic activities, transfer care of patients, conduct outpatient clinics , and maintain continuity of medical care. No new patients may be accepted after 24 hours of continuous duty. More information on the 1 day off in 7 rule: https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/368788/onedayinsevenguidelines.pdf Illness/ Disability In the event that a fellow becomes sick or disabled during their training, they must notify the Program Manager, Program Director, and Chief Fellow. The PD will make proper arrangements with the Chief Fellow to designate a fellow to cover the clinical serv ice that the sick or disabled fellow was covering. If there is a fellow taking a non -ICU elective rotation, he/she will be the first choice for substitution. If sickness or disability occurs during the weekends, the Program Director, Attending o n Call, and Chief Fellow must be notified, and they will make proper arrangements to have coverage for the service the sick or disabled fellow was covering. In the event that the sickness or disability would last longer than a month, the Program Director in conjuncti on with the Chief Fellow would modify the rotation schedule in order that all primary medical services of the Section are covered adequately, and that the training requirements of the fellows are not affected. Fatigue Prevention https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/369320/fatiguepreventionpolicy2010 -1.pdf Fatigue and stress are taken very seriously. Fellows will participate in mandatory education about fatigue, ofte n led by sleep medicine specialists (Fundamentals in Fatigue Prevention) . This material is available for additional reference on the SOLE platform. Sleep deprived fellows are prone to mistakes, and not just in the medical setting. The importance of getting regular, consistent sleep cannot be understated. Since implementation of a night float system, the majority of fellows should have a consistent nightly sleep opportunity . https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/365666/alertness -management -fatigue Policies Academic Discipline/ Dismissal Some of this has been covered above in the section on Promotion/dismissal. The goal is to have a disciplinary system to ensure fellow physicians are competent, professional, and ethical within the standards of care. The program may take corrective or disciplinary action including dismissal for cause, including but not limited to: unsatisfactory academic or clinical performance ; failure to comply with the policies, rules, and regul ations of the fellowship program, the School of M edicine , or other facilities where the physician is trained ; revocation or suspension of license ; violation of federal and/or state l aws, regulations, or ordinances; acts of moral turpitude ; insubordination; conduct that is detrimental to patient care ; or unprofessional conduct. Corrective or disciplinary actions may include but are not limited to: issue a warning or reprimand ; impose terms of remediation or a requirement for additional training, consultation or treatment ; institute, continue, or modify an existing summary suspension of a fellow physician's appointment; terminate, limit or suspend a trainee's appointment or privileges; non-renewal of a trainee's appointment ; dismiss al from the Program; or any other action that the Program or sponsoring institution deems is appropriate under the circumstances. Level I Intervention : Oral and/or Written counseling or other adverse action: Minor academic deficiencies that may be corrected at Level I include : unsatisfactory academic or clinical performance or f ailure to comply with the policies, rules, and regulations of the Program or University or other facilities where the fellow physician is trained. Corrective action for minor academic deficiencies or disciplinary offenses which do not warrant probation with remediation as defined in the Level II intervention, shall be determined and administered by each program. Corrective action may include oral or written counseling or any other action deemed appropriate by the program under the circumstances. Corrective action for such minor academic deficiencies and/or offenses are not subject to appeal. Level II Intervention : Probation/Remediation Plan or other Adverse Action : Serious academic or professional deficiencies may lead to placement of a fellow on probation. An academic or professionalism deficiency that is not successfully addressed while on probation, may lead to non -reappointment or other disciplinary action. The Program Director shall notify the fellow in writing that they have been placed on probation a nd the length of probation. A corrective and/or disciplinary plan will be developed that outlines the terms and duration of probation and the deficiencies for which probation was implemented. 58 Failure of the fellow to comply with the terms of the plan may r esult in termination or non - renewal of the trainee's appointment. Level III intervention : Dis missal and/or Non -reappointment: Any of the following may be cause for dismissal or non- reappointment including failure to comply or address the deficiencies wit hin the corrective and disciplinary plan as outlined in the Level II intervention: Demonstrated incompetence or dishonesty in the performance of professional duties, including but not limited to research misconduct Conduct which directly and substantially impairs the individual's fulfillment of institutional responsibilities, including but not limited to verified instances of sexual harassment, or of racial, gender- related, or other discriminatory practices. Insubordination by refusal to abide by legitimate reasonable directions of administrators or of the WVU Board of Governors Physical or mental disability for which no reasonable accommodation can be made, and which makes the resident unable, within a reasonable deg ree of medical certainty and by reasonably determined medical opinion, to perform assigned duties. Substantial and manifest neglect of duty. Failure to return at the end of a leave of absence. Failure to comply with all policies of WVU Hospitals, Inc. A resident who is dissatisfied with a Level II or Level III intervention, may appeal that decision by following the Academic Grievance Policy and Procedure . Grievance Policy The purpose of this policy is to provide a mechanism for resolving disagreemen ts, disputes and complaints which may arise between postgraduate residents and fellows and their Program Director or other faculty member. Policy : Postgraduate residents or fellows may appeal disagreements, disputes, or conflicts with the decisions and r ecommendations of their program regarding academic related issues using the procedure outlined in this section. This grievance procedure does not cover issues arising out of termination of a resident/fellow during an annual contract period; alleged discrimination; sexual harassment; salary or benefit issues. These grievances are covered under the employment grievance procedures for employees of West Virginia University. 59 Definitions: Grievance \u2014any unresolved disagreement, dispute or complaint a resident o r fellow has with the academic policies or procedures of the Residency Training Program or any unresolved dispute or complaint with his or her Program Director or other faculty member. These include but are not limited to issues of suspension, probation, r etention at current level of training, and refusal to issue a certificate of completion of training. Procedure : Level 1 Resolution : A good faith effort will be made by an aggrieved fellow and the Program Director to resolve a grievance, which will begin with the aggrieved fellow notifying the Program Director, in writing, of the grievance within 10 working days of the date of receipt of the dispute or complaint. This notification should include all pertinent information and evidence which supports the grievance. Within ten working days after notice of the grievance is received by the Program Director, the fellow and the Program Director will set a mutually convenient time to discuss the complaint and attempt to reach a solution. Level I of the grievance p rocedure will be deemed complete when the Program Director informs the aggrieved fellow in writing of the final decision. This should occur within 5 working days after the meeting between the fellow and Program Director. A copy of the Program Director's final decision will be sent to the Department Chair and to the Designated Institutional Official for GME (DIO). The fellow is not entitled to legal representation during the Level 1 meeting. Level 2 Resolution : If the Program Director's final written decis ion is not acceptable to the aggrieved fellow, the fellow may choose to proceed to a Level 2 resolution, which will begin with the aggrieved fellow notifying the appropriate Department Chair of the grievance in writing. Such notification must occur within 10 working days of receipt of the Program Director's final decision. If the Department Chair is also functioning as the Program Director, then the Level 2 resolution will be handled by the DIO. The fellow's notification should include all pertinent information, including a copy of the Program Director's final written decision, and evidence which supports the grievance. Within ten working days of receipt of the grievance, the fellow and the Department will set a mutually convenient time to discuss the compla int and attempt to reach a solution. Level II of this grievance procedure will be deemed complete when the Department Chair (or DIO) informs the aggrieved fellow in writing of the final decision. This should occur within 5 working days of the meeting with the fellow and the Chair. Copies of this decision will be kept on file with the Program Director, in the Chairman's office and sent to the DIO. The fellow is not entitled to legal representation during the Level 2 meeting. Level 3 Resolution : If the fellow disagrees with the Department Chair's final decision, he or she may pursue a Level 3 resolution of the grievance. The aggrieved fellow must initiate this process by presenting their grievance, in writing, along with copies of the final written decisions from the Program Director and Department Chair, and any other pertinent information, to the 60 office of Graduate Medical Education within 5 working days of receipt of the Department Chair's final written decision. Failure to submit the grievance in the 5 working day time frame will result in the fellow waiving his or her right to proceed further with this procedure. In this situation, the decision at Level II will be final. Upon timely receipt of the written grievance, the DIO will appoint a Gri evance Committee and will contact the aggrieved fellow to set a mutually convenient time to meet with them. The Grievance Committee will review and carefully consider all material presented by the fellow and his or he r Program Director or the grieve able pa rty at the scheduled meeting, following the protocol outlined below. The Grievance Commit tee will provide the aggrieved fellow with a written decision within five working days of the meeting and a copy will be placed on file in the Office of Graduate Medical Education, and with the Program Director and Department Chair. The decision of the Grievance Committee will be final. The Grievance Committee : Upon request for a formal resolution at Level III, the DIO will form a Grievance Committee composed of at least two residents/fellows, and three Program Directors. No members of this committee will be from the aggrieved fellow's own department. The DIO will choose a faculty member appointed to the Grievance Committee to be the chair of the committee. The Grievance Committee hearing should occur within 20 working days from receipt of the Level III grievance. Grievance Committee Procedure : 1. Attendance: All committee members should be present throughout the hearing. The aggrieved fellow must personally appear at the Grievance Committee meeting. 2. Conduct of Hearing: The chair will preside over the hearing, determine procedure, assure there is reasonable opportunity to present relevant oral or written information, and maintain decorum. The Chair will determine if information is relevant to the hearing and should be presented or excluded. The aggrieved fellow may present any relevant information or testimony from any colleague or faculty member. The fellow is NOT entitled to legal representation during the grievance committee hearing. The Program Director and Department Chair may be requested by the Committee to also be present for oral testimony.

Fit for Duty/I mpaired Providers -of-professionalism.pdf Internet Do not PHI on social media. https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/365672/policy -for-appropriate -use-of-the-internet.pdf Mistreatment The Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine program has a reasonable expectation that its fellows will be treated with both respect and professionalism throughout the course of their training. If a fellow does feel mistreated, they are encouraged to raise these concerns to their Program Director or Program Manager. If this isn't the preferred route for the fellow, they are also welcome to utilize the West Virginia University Graduate Medi cal Education Program Buttons for reporting Mistreatment or Supervision Issues which can be found at the following address: https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/gme/mistreatment- form/ 62 Moonlighting Because fellowship education is a full -time endeavor, ACGME fellows must ensure that moonlighting does not interfere with their ability to achieve the goals and objectives of their educational Program. Fellows are responsible for ensuring that moonlighting and other outside activities do not result in fatigue that might affect patient care or learning. Fellows are responsible for complying with their Program Duty Hours Policy. The ACGME requires Program Director pre -approval of all moonlighting activity by ACGME fellows. Fellows on J1 VISA's are not permitted to moonlight, either internally or externally. It is the responsibility of other fellows to obtain written permission to moonlight from the Program Director prior to beginning the moonlighting activity. This is true both for \"internal\" and \"external\" moonlighting. All fellows must sign a Moonlighting Approval Form which will be placed in their file. The Program Director will monitor fellow performance in the Program to ensure that moonlighting activities are not adversely affecting patient care, learning or fellow fatigue. If the Program Director determines that the fellow's performance does not meet expectations, permission to moonlight will be withdrawn. The GMEC will periodically review reports by the Program Directors regarding moonlighting activity. Any fellow moonlighting without written pre -appr oval will be subject to disciplinary action. \"Internal moonlighting\" is defined as extra work for extra pay performed at a site that participates in the fellow 's training Program. This activity must be supervised by faculty and is not to exceed the level of clinical activity currently approved for the trainee. While performing internal moonlighting services, fellows are not to perform as independent practitioners . All moonlightin g hours must be documented in E -Value, and they must comply with written policies regarding all Duty Hours as per the training Program, WVU and ACGME. \"External moonlighting\" is defined as work for pay performed at a site that does not participate in the fellow's training Program. External moonlighting hours must be documented (including days, hours, location, and brief description of type of service provided) in order to comply with Medicare reimbursement requirements for GME. For external moonlighting, the trainee is not covered under the University's professional liability insurance program as the activity is outside the scope of the University's employment. The trainee is responsible for his/her own professional liability coverage (eit her independently or through the entity for which the trainee is moonlighting), DEA licensure, Medicare (or other governmental) provider number and billing training, and licensure requirements by the West Virginia State Medical Board and any other requirements for clinical privileging at the employment site. 63 Please note the following rules regarding moonlighting: 1. Moonlighting is not permitted during inpatient ward service rotations, MICU, and Consults. Therefore, moonlighting (both external and internal) is allowed only during elective months. 2. Fellows must limit moonlighting shifts to no more than two per month. 3. All hours accumulated during internal/external moonlighting must be logged into E*Value system. 4. Moonlighting, both internal and external, must comply with ALL the duty hour regulations per the training program, WVU and the ACGME. 5. If an in -training examination score falls below the 30th percentile, moonlighting will not be permitted and any existing moonlighting agreement already in place will b e revoked by the Program Director. 6. If a fellow is found to be moonlighting without permission, during a blackout period as detailed in #1 or in excess of the amount of sessions permitted as detailed in #2, penalties can apply such as permanent revocation of moonlighting privileges for the duration of the fellowship, being placed on a professionalism watch, probation, and in extreme cases, termination. https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/media/365744/gme -moonlighting -policy.pdf -requirements - policy -2_12_21.pdf Work Environment It is the responsibility of the program director and faculty to establish the best possible environment for both fellows and for patient care, while ensuring that undue stress and fatigue among fellows are avoided. 64 Patient support services will be provided in a manner appropriate and consistent with educational objectives and patient care such that the fellow does not spend an inordinate amount of time in non -educational activities that can be discharged properly to other personnel. However, it is recognized that there is educational value in activity such as care coordination and communication with insurance companies. It is expected that the fellows will be involved to some degree in these types of activities. An effective laboratory and medical records system will be provided in order to allow proper performance of the educational programs and timely, quality patient care. Appropriate security and personal safety measures will be provided to fellows in all locations in which fellow activities occur. Respectful, professional environments will be provided at all times in the location where the fellowship activities occur. Disaster "}
