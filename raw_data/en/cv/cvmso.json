She didn't rush through the appointment, she took her time to check and make sure that the adjustments worked and asked plenty of questions. I'm looking forward to using this office moving forward and so glad we found her for our family! I hugged her after my first visit and could not get over how much better I felt after one visit. I will continue to see her as needed and I have been spreading the word to others that there are doctors out there that are a diamond in the rough. She truly is a gem! Dr. Shanna is the best chiropractor I have been to. I was in so much pain when I went to her. After a few treatments, I'm pain free. My wife absolutely loves her and swears by her. She has alleviated so much of my wife's pain over the last year and says she is the best one she has ever been to. Dr. Shanna works on the muscles before adjusting. For me having the muscles loosened, gives me more time between adjustments. She offers acupuncture, decompression table and much more. Very knowledgeable! Shanna is incredible! She has helped me through fertility issues and two pregnancies, including helping to turn a stubborn baby who was a week overdue and not quite in position. She also has helped my husband and both of my girls! She truly cares for each and every patient and is always there when you need her. "}
