If so, you are not alone. The holidays are a beautiful time of year filled with family, friends, and a lot of festive gatherings. Even though they are a seasonal rite of passage, holiday parties can do a number on the digestive system with all of the delicious and decadent foods, and general overindulgence. As you enter the holiday season, it's important to keep your digestive system healthy, so you are able to truly enjoy the foods that you'll be eating. Herbs To Help You Feel Your Best This Holiday Season Herbs have been used for thousands of years to sustain digestive health including supporting the health of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract and providing relief from occasional gas, bloating, and upset stomachs.* Below are some of our favorite herbs to help keep your system in balance this holiday season. Triphala Triphala is an herbal blend that has been a staple in Ayurvedic medicine for over 2,000 years, and is made up of three herbs, hence \"Tri\" in its name. The berries that make up this blend are [Amla](/blogs/herbs/amla), [Belleric Myrobalan](/blogs/herbs/belleric-myrobalan), and [Chebulic Myrobalan](/blogs/herbs/chebulic-myrobalan). In Ayurveda, Triphala is used for a wide array of purposes, as it is considered a tri-doshic remedy, meaning that it is balancing to all constitutions and body types (vata, kapha, and pitta). The Amla berry used in this blend, also known as Indian Gooseberry, is reported to contain as much Vitamin C as 20 oranges. [Triphala Fruit](/products/triphala-fruit) is a popular tonic that helps to gently cleanse your system and maintain normal regularity.* Peppermint With over 600 different kind of species of Mint, [Peppermint](/blogs/herbs/peppermint) is one of the more popular of the species, and it was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans as a stomach soothing aid. The fragrance of Peppermint is enjoyed by many in candles and essential oils, and is even delicious just as the leaf picked from an herb garden. Popular today in teas, Peppermint supports digestive health and function.* [Peppermint Leaf, Certified Organic liquid extract](/products/peppermint-leaf-certified-organic) is beneficial for those who may have overindulged with food and drink and need some extra support.* Licorice [Licorice](/blogs/herbs/licorice) has been used for hundreds of centuries, and was popular in Greece, China, and Egypt for its traditional use for stomach inflammation and supporting the respiratory system.*1 Today, it is still one of the most common herbs used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and is one of the most trusted herbs among traditional botanical practitioners.
