I work full time, have a family, sports, commute, --and this cleanse was manageable! I had such a positive cleanse experience; I plan to do it again and I have it on my planner already. Veena emailed me my customized Home Ayurveda Cleanse, tailored to what was going on for me, and keeping in mind my busy schedule. I did a 7 Day Home Ayurveda Cleanse.
