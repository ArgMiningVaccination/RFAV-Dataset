And with the first wave of vaccinations, there have been reports of allergic reactions and even anaphylaxis. Most importantly, all patients should know that reactions to vaccines, in general, are rare with the incidence of anaphylaxis estimated at 1.31 in 1 million doses given. In fact, many vaccines can trigger a range of short-lived side effects, that are not indicative of allergy at all. The most common side effects are injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and joint pain. Some people in the clinical trials have reported fever. Side effects are more common after the second dose. In addition, younger adults, who have more robust immune systems, reported more side effects than older adults. And to be clear, these side effects are a sign of an immune system kicking into gear. However, due to the reported allergic reactions, albeit rare, there are now guidelines for health care professionals administering the vaccine, including: 1. The vaccine should be administered in a health care setting and all individuals must be observed for at least 15-30 minutes after injection to monitor for any adverse reaction. All anaphylactic reactions should be managed immediately with epinephrine as the first line treatment. 2. According to the CDC, if a patient has a severe allergic reaction after getting the first shot, they should not get the second shot. Patients who experience a severe allergic reaction may be referred by their doctor to an allergy specialist to provide more care or advice. 3. It should not be administered to individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine. Although the specific vaccine component causing anaphylaxis has not been identified, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is one of its ingredients and has been known to cause anaphylaxis. 4. There is not much data related to risk in individuals with a history of allergic reactions to previous vaccinations and/or mast cell activation syndrome/idiopathic anaphylaxis. 5. Individuals with common allergies to medications, foods, inhalants (environmental allergens), insects and latex are no more likely than the general public to have an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccines. 6. The COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and can be administered to immunocompromised patients. There is a possibility of a diminished immune response to the vaccines in these patients. And lastly, please stay safe and healthy. See us for a patient appointment if you have concerns or questions about the COVID-19 vaccines. Team Schreiber Allergy "}
