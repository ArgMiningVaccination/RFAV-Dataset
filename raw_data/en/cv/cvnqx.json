It represent s the first comprehensive annual assessment of vaccine safety in the province and fulfils a previous recommendation to report Ontario AEFI data on an annual basis . The report aims to encourage ongoing assessment of vaccine safety and provide relevant and timely information for health professionals and the public about the safety of vaccines adm inistered in Ontario. AEFIs reported following vaccines administered between January 1and December 31, 2012 , were extracted from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS). There were 631 reports of confirmed AEFI s representing an overall repo rting rate of 4.7 per 100 000 population. The number of reports increased in 2012 compared to the previous two years ; however , the rate of reporting in 2012 relative to population size in Ontario is lower than some other jurisdictions. The distribution of AEFI reports by age was weighted toward younger ages with over half of all reports for individuals 18 years of age and under , and the distribution of reports by sex varied by age with a predominance of AEFI reports among adult females. AEFI reports by spec ific agent are primarily driven by the volume of vaccine distribut ed. Reported events were consistent with the safety profile of many vaccines in which injection - site reactions are most frequent. A number of limitations are described, many of which are in herent to passive AEFI surveillance systems . Limitations specific to Ontario include the lack of a population -based immunization registry required to calculate incidence rates of AEFI s and limited analysis of trends over time. Recently implemented updates to AEFI surveillance guidelines will contribute towards improved quality and completeness of data. Finally , the following actions are recommended to support dissemination of the report findings and contribute to continuous improvement of AEFI surveillance data in the province . 1. Continue to produce a report that assesses AEFI s on an annual basis, using an iPHIS data extraction date of May 1 for all AEFI s reported following vaccines administered in the previous calendar year and after an annual data -cleaning process to ensure consistency and comparability of data over time. 2. Develop and implement a knowledge translation plan for the annual report which includes distribution of an annual vaccine safety report to public health units (P HUs), health professionals and members of the public to contribute to openness and transparency of the vaccine safety surveillance system in Ontario. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 3 3. Implement an anaphylaxis reporting tool to improve the quality and completeness of reporting of events managed as anaphylaxis and aid in provincial assessment and classification of these events using standard, internationally accepted criteria. 4. Further explore possible explanations for under -reporting of AEFI s and recommend strategies to improve reporting rates in Ontario. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 4 Background Vaccines are widely considered to be one of the most successful and cost -effective public health interventions.1, 2 With this success and the declining incidence of many vaccine -preventable diseas es, public focus has shifted to the safety of vaccines. Tolerance for adverse events is low because vaccines are administered to large cohorts of healthy people, particularly children.3 In recent years, reports have show n that the public is more concern ed about vaccine safety and less confiden t in vaccines.4, 5 Improved communication about vaccine safety will contribute to restoring confidence and building trust in the vaccine system and continued success of immunization programs.3, 5-8 In Canada, vaccines are highly regulated and monitored to ensure they are as safe as possible.6 They are thoroughly reviewed for efficacy and safety prior to being approved for use. Vaccine manufacturers are required to adhere to internationally accepted standards of manufacturing to ensure quality and consistency. In addition, all lots of vaccine are subject to Health Canada's lot release program which specifies standards for the production of each lot that must be met before sale in Canada. 3 The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) independ ently reviews the available evidence on safety and efficacy . It also makes recommendations for the use of currently or newly approved vaccines , including identification of groups at risk for vaccine -preventable disease for whom vaccine programs should be t argeted.9 Following approval of a new vaccine, post -marketing surveillance is initiated to ensure the ongoing monitoring of safety in the context of \"scaled up\" vaccine production and expansion of the p opulation receiving the vaccine . Individual AEFI case reports represent an important source of data because they have the potential to generate safety signals not previously recognized or an increase in frequency or severity of a previously recognized AEFI which can be further evaluated.10 This is particularly important for rare adverse events , which may not have been evident in clinical trials due to their limited sample size. Within the context of post- marketing surveillance, AEFIs are defined as any untoward medical occurrence that follows immunization and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, laboratory finding, sym ptom, or disease.10 Post -marketing surveillance is a shared responsibility between Health Canada, the vaccine manufacturers, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and provincial/territorial (P /T) public health authorities. Reports of AEFIs made directly to vaccine manufacturers are sent to Health Canada, while AEFIs reported to P/T public health authorities are reported to the Canadian Adverse Event Surveillance System (CAEFISS), maintained by PHAC. PHAC and Health Canada co ordinate post -marketing vaccine safety surveillance nationally. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 5 Adverse event following immunization surveillance in Ontario The objectives of adverse event following immunization (AEFI) surveillance in Ontario are to: Identify and investigate serious o r unexpected occurrences of AEFI s, particularly for new vaccines Detect and investigate safety signals (e.g. , lot-specific problems) Estimate provincial rates of reported AEFIs by vaccine Report to stakeholders on the safety of publicly funded vaccines in Ontario Maintain public confidence in vaccine programs Reports of AEFIs generally originate from a health professional or a vaccine recipient reporting to their local public health unit ( PHU) (Figure 1). While this passive reporting mechanism represents t he majority of AEFI surveillance, Ontario does receive reports from two hospitals in the province that participate in the Immunization Monitoring Program A CTive (IMPACT), a paediatric hospital- based sentinel surveillance system of selected vaccine preventable diseases and AEFI s in Canada. The two sites are in Toronto ( The Hospital for Sick Children) and Ottawa (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario). Figure 1. Overview of the adverse event following immunization (AEFI) surveillance process in Ontario Notes: 1. IMPACT = Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive. 2. AEFIs reported to the vaccine manufacturer directly are reported to the Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction database, maintained by Health Canada. For reports made via this route only, there is no public health follow -up or validation of information. 3. Dotted line indicates proposed reporting process . 1 2 3 Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 6 Reporting of AEFI s by specific health professionals is mandated u nder Section 38 of the Health Protection and Promotio n Act (HPPA) which specifies that: \"A physician, a member of the College of Nurses of Ontario or a member of the Ontario College of Pharmacists who, while providing professional services to a person, recognizes the presence of a reportable event and forms the opinion that it may be related to the administration of an immunizing agent shall, within seven days after recognizing the reportable event, report thereon to the medical officer of health of the health unit where the professional services are provided \".11 The HPPA also outlines adverse events and immunizing agents that are specifically reportable. Although some vaccines are not specifically listed in the HPPA as immunizing agents, the Ministry of Health and Long- Term Care (MOHLTC) has requested that PHU s voluntarily report adverse events following all vaccines (March 27, 2009 , memorandum to m edical officers of health from the c hief medical officer of health, MOHLTC ; unreferenced ). In addition to mandated reporting by some health professionals, AEFI s are also voluntarily reported by vaccine recipients or their parents/guardians. Reports may be made by telephone or by completing an AEFI reporting form and sending it by mail or fax to the PHU . PHUs monitor, investigate , and document all suspected cases of AEFIs that meet the provincial reporting criteria and promptly report these cases to PHO as required by the Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS).12 The OPHS also requires that PHUs promote the reporting of AEFI s by health care providers in their jurisdiction in accordance with the HPP A. The medical officer of health ( MOH ) may also provide recommendations with respect to additional follow -up and receip t of further doses of vaccine to vaccine recipients who experience an AEFI . On January 1, 2012, PHO assumed responsibility for provincial AEFI surveillance and case management from the MOHLTC. In early 2012 , PHO completed an assessment of the current status of vaccine safety surveillance in Ontario with respect to the overall surveillance objectives . It also hosted a vaccine safet y meeting at which Canadian and international experts were invited to share best practices and models of AEFI surveillance. The findings of this assessment and consultation process identified a number of strengths and challenges in the current passive AEFI surveillance system . There was consensus that enhancements were both necessary and feasible within the existing framework. Building on this work, an HPV safety assessment completed in the fall of 2012 included a detailed description of the limitations of provincial AEFI surveillance data. 13 Based on the HPV safety assessment , the following five recommendations were made to improve overall data quality : 1. Revise the Infectious Diseases Protocol (2009), Appendix B, Case Definitions for AEFIs 14 to clarify the AEFI confirmed -case definition and criteria for specific events of interest to reflect national case definitions and incorporate best practices from o ther Canadian jurisdictions and Brighton Collaboration case definitions, where available. 2. Update the iPHIS application with adverse -event values that are consistent with provincial case definitions for AEFI s. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 7 3. Revise the iPHIS AEFI User Guide15 with specific, detailed instructions and rationale to support valid, complete and timely data entry with emphasis on case and adverse -event classification s. 4. Implement an Ontario -specific AEFI reporting form for use by health care providers to reduce the barriers identified with PHAC 's current AEFI reporting form. 5. Produce an annual report of Ontario AEFI data. The first four recommendations were implemented on January 1, 2013. The implementation of these recommendations was guided by the Vaccine Safety Surveillance Working Group (VSSWG), a provincial working group with representation from PHUs, MOHLTC, PHAC , and PHO, formed in June 2012. In 2012, PHO transmitted data on all AEFI s reported in Ontario to PHAC on a monthly basis for inclusion in the Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System (CAEFISS), a national database containing AEFIs reported from all provinces and territories in Canada. Objectives and scope of the AEFI annual report The purpose of this report is to summarize AEFIs reported in Ontario following vaccines administered in 2012. This report represents the first comprehensive annual vaccine safety assessment in Ontario. PHUs and vaccine providers are the primary intended au dience of this report. Given that this is the first report of its kind in Ontario, it includes a complete description of the provincial AEFI surveillance system and a discussion of its limitations. In addition, the report includes recommendations for impr oved AEFI data/surveillance processes . Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 8 Methods Provincial surveillance systems to monitor AEFIs in Ontario AEFI information is reported by P HUs via the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS), an electronic reporting system for reportable di seases and reportable events, including AEFIs , in Ontario. AEFIs must be reported using iPHIS within five business days of receipt of initial notification to a PHU .16 AEFI reports are classified in iPHIS according to the Infectious Diseases Protocol, Appendix B (AEFI), 200914 with the exception of AEFIs reported after January 1, 2013 , which were classified according to the Infectious Diseases Protocol, Appendix B (AEFI), 2013.17 Appendix 1 provides a detailed summary of the revisions to the iPHIS field affected by this update. The minimum data elements to be reported for each AEFI are specified in the iPHIS AEFI User Guide (2009) and associated bulletins and directives issued by the MOHLTC. 15, 16 On January 1, 2013 , a revised iPHIS User Guide for AEFIs was issued . It is aligned with the revised Appendix B (AEFI) 2013 document and provides direction for data entry of AEFIs reported on or after Jan uary 1, 2013.18 From January 2012 onward, PHO reviewed all AEFIs reported by PHUs on a weekly basis for data quality and completeness, with an emphasis on serious AEFIs (defined on page 9 ). PHUs were contacted directly to request an amendment of a report if key information was missing/incomplete (e.g. , agent, reaction, case notes). In addition to monitoring ongoing data quality , PHO led a formal data clean -up initiative between February 15 and March 31, 2013. PHO requested v ia the Weekly iPHIS Bulletin that PHUs review AEFI reports following vaccines administered in 2012 and update missing/incomplete information for selected data fields.19 Analysis of epidemiologic data We extracted all reports of AEFIs with a vaccine administration date from January 1 to December 31, 2012, from iPHIS as of May 6, 2013. Excluded from this analysis are r eports of adverse events associated with passive immunizing agents (e.g. , immune globu lin) or diagnostic agents (e.g. , tuberculin skin test) only (i.e. , no active immunizing agent administered at the same time) . Reports of AEFIs are classified as \"Confirmed, \" \"Persons under investigation (PUI) ,\" or \"Does not meet \" (DNM) case definition according to the iPHIS User Guide for AEFI . 15, 18 As per these guidelines, the \"PUI\" case classification is for use in the investigation stage only . When the case is closed, it should be updated to \" Confirmed \" or \"Does not meet. \" Other case classifications such as \" Suspect \" or \"Probable \" are not applicable to AEFI and are not used. As of January 1, 2013, when updated provincial case definitions were published , 17 the \"Confirmed \" and \"Does not meet \" case definitions are: Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 9 Confirmed Any reported event listed in sections 5.0 (Clinical Evidence) in a vaccine recipient which follows immunization which cannot be clearly attributed to other causes. A causal relationship with the administration of the vaccine does not need to be proven. Does Not Meet Any reported event in a vaccine recipient which follows immunization which has been clearly attributed to other causes. Prior to January 1, 2013 , there was no explicit definition of a confirmed AEFI report separate from criteria for specific types of events.14 For thi s report, we limited descriptive analyses of demographic, temporal, agent/event- specific and geographical trends to \"Confirmed \" AEFI reports. Each AEFI report represents one individual vaccine recipient and describes one or more adverse events that have be en temporally associated with receipt of one or more active immunizing agents administered at the same time. For each AEFI report, one or more specific adverse events are selected from the \" Adverse event reaction(s) \" field in iPHIS based on criteria for sp ecific AEFIs described in Appendix B (AEFI) .14, 17 We grouped these values into categories of adverse events for this analysis. See A ppendix 1 f or a complete description of adverse event reaction(s) values available in iPHIS (both before and after changes implemented on Jan uary 1, 2013) as well as corresponding adverse -event categories for analysis . For each AEFI report there is also o ne or more active immunizing agents selected from the \" Agent \" field in iPHIS. We refer to these agent values throughout this report using standard acronyms (e.g., MMR for measles, mumps, rubella). S ee Appendix 3 for a complete list of agent abbreviations, corresponding product/trade names and available \"Agent \" values in iPHIS . We defined reports of AEFIs as \"serious \" using the International Conference on Harmoni sation (ICH) definition which defines a serious AEFI as an event that resulted in death , was life threatening , required in-patient hospitalization of 24 hours or more or prolongation of existing hospitalization , resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , causes congenital anomaly/birth defect , or, any other important medical event that may have jeopardized the patient or may have required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above .10 We designated specific medically important events as serious based on the Vacc ine Vigilance Working Group (VVWG), a Federal- Provincial- Territorial working group led by PHAC, for the purpose of AEFI surveillance in Canada. For AEFI surveillance in Ontario, m edically important events include anaphylaxis, Guillain Barr\u00e9 s yndrome (GBS), Bell's palsy, paralysis seizure, meningitis, encephalopathy/encephalitis, intussusception and thrombocytopenia (See Appendix 2). We calculated AEFI reporting rates using the 2010 and 2011 Ontario population estimates and 2012 projected population of Ontario20 (overall reporting rate per 100 000 population) and doses distributed within the publicly funded immunization program (vaccine -specific reporting rate per 100 000 doses distributed) usin g net vaccine distribution data provided by the Ontario Government Pharmaceutical and Medical Supply Service (OGPMSS). Net vaccine distribution data estimates include vaccine Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 10 wastage/reusable vaccine returned to OGPMSS. Reporting rates using doses distribu ted as the denominator were not calculated for vaccines that were exclusively privately purchased in Ontario in 2012 (i.e., not publicly funded). We performed statistical analyses using commercially available software, including SAS version 9.3 (SAS Instit ute, Cary, NC, USA), IBM SPSS version 19.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). This project was reviewed on behalf of the PHO Ethics Review Board (ERB) through the administrative review process and was granted app roval for a period of one year commencing May 16, 2013. Notes on interpretation The adverse events we describe in this report are temporally associated and are not necessarily causally linked to vaccine. Our a ssessment is based on iPHIS data only and not comprehensive chart review. We provide reporting rate estimates for comparison to other passive surveillance systems and monitoring reporting trends over time and they should not be interpreted as incidence rates. Trends in reported AEFI s are influenced by changes to the publicly funded program. Recent changes that may impact on AEFI surveillance data presented in this report include:21 Implementation of a new/revised publicly funded programs in August 2011, including: o Rotavirus vaccine (Rot -1/Rotarix\u00ae) for infants at ages 2 and 4 months o Reduction from four to three doses of p neumococcal conjugate 13 -valent (P neu-C-13) vaccine for low -risk children o Routine second dose of v aricella (Var) administered as the combined agent MMRV at four to six years of age (previously second dose of MMR was administered at 18 months of age) o Second dose Var vaccine catch -up program for children born on or after Jan uary 1, 2000 , and who are at least 4 years of age o Pertussis vaccine for all ad ults 19 to 64 years of age who have not received an adolescent booster at 14 to 16 years of age . Replacement of DTaP -IPV (Quadracel\u00ae) with for the 4 - to 6-year- old booster dose in April 2012 . New influenza vaccine products implemented for the 2011 -2012 influenza season including Fluad\u00ae (for high - risk persons 65 years of age and older) and Agriflu\u00ae for all those age d 6 months and older , as well as a full dose of trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) for infants and children 6 to 35 month s of age and removal of egg allergy as a contraindication to TIV . Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 11 Results In total, 765 AEFI s were reported in Ontario following vaccines administered between January 1 and December 31, 2012. Of these, 631 had a case classification of \"Confirmed \" and 134 had a case classification of \"Does not meet\" definition (Figure 2). There were no AEFI s with a case classification of \"Persons under investigation .\" Figure 2. Adverse events following immunization reports following vaccines administered in 2012, by classification status Among the 631 confirmed AEFI s, 56 (8.9%) were classified as serious (described below). From all confirmed AEFI reports where the reporting source was completed (n=583), the most frequent reporting source was physicians representing (38%). Health care professionals (21%) and family members (17%) were the second and third most common reporting sources. The overall reporting rate of \"Confirmed \" AEFI s following vaccines administered in Ontario in 2012 was 4.7 per 100 000 population. The annual reporting rate increased 30.6% in 2012 from an average reporting rate of 3.6 per 100 000 population in 2010 and 2011 (3.5 and 3.7 per 100 000 p opulation in 2010 and 2011 respectively). In addition, the proportion of reports classified as \"Confirmed \" (relative to other case classifications , e.g., DNM, PUI) increased from 2010 (72.4%; 466/644) and (73.4%; 500/681) to 2012 (82.5%; 631/765). Reports of AEFI s by month of vaccine administration in 2012 , range from a low of 25 reports in August to a peak of 133 reports in October, followed by 108 in November and a small peak in February (n=54). This general trend by month of administration in 2012 i s consistent with the average number of AEFI reports by vaccine administration month in 2010 and 2011 (not shown) and mirrors the monthly distribution of vaccine by OGPMSS (Figure 3 ). 82.5% (631) 17.5% (134) CONFIRMED DOES NOT MEET DEFINITION Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 12 Figure 3.

Includes net vaccine distribution from Ontario Government Pharmacy and Medical Supply Service (OGPMSS) (i.e., publicly funded vaccine doses) only. Counts include all confirmed AEFIs reported in 2012. The distribution of AEFI reports by age was weighted toward younger ages with over half of all reports for individuals 18 years of age and under (31.7% and 22.7% in those less than 7 years of age and 7 to 17 years of age, respectively). The proportion of AEFI reports decreased with increasing age with 20.1%, 14.3% and 11.3% among those 18 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 years of age. Among overall AEFI reports by sex, females outnumbered males slightly more than 2:1 with 67.4% (n=425) of reports among females. The distribution of AEFI reports by sex varies with age. While there is a slight predominance of males among reports in children under 7 years of age, female predominance begins among those 7 to 17 years of age and is most pronounced in adults 18 years of age and older (82.6% female) compared with those younger than 18 years (54.5% female) (Figure 4 ). It should be noted that there is one publicly funded vaccination program that targets only female adolescents (HPV4), therefore we would expect more AEFI reports among females 7 to 17 year s of age. 0500,0001,000,0001,500,0002,000,0002,500,0003,000,000 020406080100120140 JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC Doses distributed Number of reports Month 2012 reports Vaccine dose distribution Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 13 Figure 4. Age and sex distribution of confirmed AEFI s reported following vaccines administered in 2012 In reports with health care utilization information completed, medical consultation was sought in 76% (471/620) of reports while 18% (115/628) had an emergency room visit and 4% (24/614) were admitted to the hospital. In the majority of AEFI reports , individuals had recovered at the time of reporting (65%; 408/631) ; whereas , in 20% (126/631) of reports individuals had not yet recovered with 3% (21/631) experiencing residual effects and 12% (76/631) ha ving an \"unknown \" outcome. AEFI reports by agent The majority of the 631 AEFI reports in 2012 were associated with one agent (84.0%); 10.1% of reports were associated with two agents and 5.9% were associated with three or more agents . The highest number of agents in a single report was five. The most frequently reported agents among all confirmed AEFI reports of AEFI by agent were observed with DTaP -IPV (103 .9 per 100 000 doses distributed), followed by BCG (82.6 per 100 000 doses distributed), rabies (40.8 per 100 000 doses distributed), HPV4 (26.7 per 100 000 doses distributed) and HB (21.1 per 100 000 doses distributed (Table 1). Agent -specific reporting rates of serious AEFI s ranged from 0 to 3.5 per 100 000 with the highest reporting rate associated with MMRV.

Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 16 AEFI reports by event The majority of reports were associated with one adverse event category (73.5%; 464/631) while 21.9% of reports were associated with two categories (138/631) and 4.6% (29/631) were associated with 3 or more adverse event categories (the highest number of adverse event categories in a single report was 4). The most frequently reported events were injection -site reactions (including pain, redness, swelling, nodule, abscess and cellulitis) which were present in 40.0% (252/631) of all AEFI reports, while rash and allergic skin reactions were also relativ ely common (21.7% and 20.8% respectively). \" Other severe/unusual events \" were reported in almost one fifth of all reports (19.5%) (Table 2).

Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 18 Serious AEFI s There were 56 reports of AEFI s that were classified as serious representing 8.9% of all repo rts. Among serious AEFI reports , 57.1% (n=32) were related solely to a medically important event, 30.4% were related solely to a hospital admission of >24 hours (n=17) and 12.5% (n=7) had both a hospital admission of >24 hours and a medically important event. Among all hospital admissions (n=24), the median length of stay was 2.5 days (range 1 to 18 days). There were 19 (79.2%) hospital admissions among those <18 years of age, of which 11 (57.9%) were detected and investigated by IMPACT. Among all medically important events (n=39), the most frequently reported was \"Anaphylaxis \" (n=18; 46.2%) (n=1; 2.6%). There were no reports of death temporally associated with receipt of a vaccine. There were a total of 18 reports of anaphylaxis temporally associated with 20 agents: eight Inf, three HPV4, wo HB, one MMRV and - concomitantly and one HA -Typh -I. All anaphylaxis reports were assessed using the Brighton Collaboration case definition (22) and six (33.3%) met the case definition of an aphylaxis (four were level one, one was level two and one was level three) . Nine (50.0%) reports did not meet the Brighton Collaboration case definition based on information contained in the report and three (16.7%) reports did not contain enough informati on to complete an assessment. There were 12 reports of \"C onvulsions/seizure s\" temporally associated with 19 agents: three and P neu-C-13 administered concomitantly, three Inf, one HB, one HB and Men -C-ACWY administered concomitantly, one Var , one Zos, one HAHB and one DTaP -IPV-Hib. The age range was 1 to 69 years and seven (58.3%) reports from vaccine recipients that were under 5 years of age. Among these seven reports, all were febrile seizures and five were admitted to hospital. There was o ne additional hospital admission in an older child. Both of the encephalopathy/encephalitis reports were temporally associated with administration of influenza vaccine, one in which HPV4 was concomitantly administered. Upon case -level review, one report was incorrectly classified as \"Encephalopathy/encephalitis \" while the other was a suspected viral encephalitis report that was admitted to hospital 28 days following receipt of HPV4 and influenza vaccine s with symptoms of nausea, vomiting and altered level o f consciousness. There were three reports of \" Bell's palsy \" and one report of \"Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome \" (GBS) , all temporally associated with receipt of influenza vaccine in adults and with no related hospital admissions. Among 17 serious reports with a hospital admission related to a \"non-medically important event ,\" the reported events were \"Cellulitis \" of anaphylaxis, reported as \"Other severe/unusual events .\" Among reports of cellulitis resulting in hospital admission, four were in children between 1 and 9 years of age (one associated with Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 19 administration of P neu-P-23, on e Inf, one Inf with P neu-P-23 administered concomitantly and one DTaP - IPV-Hib) and two were in adults (both associated with administration of P neu-P-23). Risk factors Among all reports, 19.2% (n=121) had risk factor information completed in iPHIS. The mos t frequently reported risk factor was \" Chronic illness/underlying medical condition \" (67.6%; n=94), followed n=1).

It fulfils a previous recommendation made for annual reporting of Ontario AEFI data to facilitate ongoing assessment of vaccine safety and to provide relevant and timely information for health professionals and the public about the safety of vaccines administered in Ontario.13 The following discussion is based on analysis of AEFI information entered into iPHIS that was temporally associated with vaccines. A causality assessment or assessment of case information beyond what is available within the iPHIS application has not been completed. Reporting rate estimates are for comparison purposes and monitoring over time and should not be i nterpreted as incidence rates. The annual reporting rate of 4.7 per 100 000 population for AEFI in Ontario in 2012 is lower than annual (per population) reporting rates from passive AEFI surveillance systems in other jurisdictions . For example, the most re cent annual AEFI reporting rates estimated from passive surveillance systems in Australia and the US (10.4 and 7.4 per 100 000 population, respectively).23-25 From a national perspective, Ontario represents approximately 22.9% of all AEFI reports made by all provincial/territorial health authorities to CAEFISS compared with representing 38.7% of the national population. The estimated national reporting rate based on AEFI s reporte d by provincial/territorial health authorities to CAEFISS is 9.4 per 100 000 population (Canadian Adverse Event s Following Immunization Surveillance System Database Search, July 15th, 2013. Public Health Agency of Canada ; unreferenced) . It is important to note that a higher overall reporting rate of AEFI s (across all agents) does not necessarily suggest a vaccine safety co ncern ; rather , it is an indicator of a robust passive vaccine safety surveillance system. We anticipate that Ontario's overall reporting rate will increase g iven that its rate is lower than the national rate as well as rates reported from other passive vaccine safety surveillance systems and the increased focus on vaccine safety surveillance including the publication of annual provincial v accine safety reports. The quantity of AEFI reports to a passive vaccine safety surveillance system contributes to establishing a clear historical baseline which can be used to identify future vaccine safety signals. In Ontario, t he increase in the annual reporting rate, particularly between 2011 and 2012 , likely reflects an increased focus on AEFI reporting in the province . This includes activities undertaken to enhance AEFI surveillance in 2012 and 2013, including the release of new guidelines for provinc ial AEFI surveillance (e.g. , surveillance case definitions, iPHIS U ser Guide), delivery of AEFI surveillance training , and professional education on vaccine safety (e.g. , PHO Rounds). This increase may also be attributable in part to the addition of new pu blicly funded programs (e.g. , rotavirus vaccine) in 2011 which would increase the total number of vaccines administered in the province. Annual monitoring will demonstrate whether this trend towards increased reporting of AEFIs in the province continues. The increased proportion of cases classified as \"Confirmed \" provincially in 2012 reflects a shift away from the use of other case classifications (e.g. , \"Person s under investigation \" and \"Does not meet\"). This Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 22 is most likely the result of active ongoing follow -up in 2012 and year -end data quality measures implemented by PHO and conducted by P HUs, aimed in part to improve the validity of AEFI case classification. Misclassification of AEFI s was first identified in early 2012 when it was noted anecdotally that the case classification field was being used to reflect a causation assessment (e.g. , \"Confirmed \" implied that the vaccine caused the event). This was further validated by the HPV4 AEFI assessment which found substantial misclassification of reports.13 These findings led to the clarification of the definitions of \" Confirmed \" and \"Does not meet\" in the Infectious Diseases Protocol (Appendix B: AEFI).17It is expected that the proportion of AEFI reports that are confirmed will continue to increase with the uptake of new surveillance case definitions and continued active, ongoing data -quality follow - up and efforts to standardize AEFI surveillance practices. AEFI reports by month of vaccine administration demonstrate a wide variation. The most prominent peak (Oct ober -November ) reflects delivery of the universal influenza immunization program (UIIP) whic h accounts for almost half of all vaccine doses distributed in Ontario in a given year, as well as initiation of school- based vaccin ation programs (HB, Men -C-ACWY & HPV4) in the fall. Another small peak (February ) may again be related to subsequent doses a dministered as part of school- based immunization programs and the PHUs' Immunization of School Pupils Act (ISPA) assessment and enforcement activities. The age distribution of AEFI reports is as expected with a concentration of reports among those less than 18 years of age, the age group for whom the greatest number of doses is recommended in the public ly funded routine immunization schedules.26 A variation in sex ratio by age is consistent with what has been observe d in other passive AEFI surveillance systems.24, 27, 28 The over -representation of females in the adolescent age group is expected because HPV4 vaccine is provided only to G rade 8 females. Among adult s it may be related to higher uptake of vaccine among females 29, higher proportion of females among health care workers who are targeted for specific vaccines 30, as well as differences in health -seeking behaviour between males and females.31, 32 With respect to o utcome, most reports indicated that the vaccine recipient had recovered at the time of reporting suggesting that most events were mild and /or self- limited. It is important to note that outcome is assessed at the time of reporting of the event in iPHIS and there is no subsequent follow -up to assess when recovery occurred or if there were permanent sequelae from the event where the outcome values \" Not yet recovered \" or \"Residual effects \" were selected. The most frequently reported agents by proportion of all AEFI reports , is generally consistent with vaccine distribution volume by agent ; however , this comparison includes only those vaccine doses distributed by OGPMSS. Reflecting this overall trend, influenza is the most frequently reported agent with the highe st volume distribution. One notable exception is DTaP -IPV (Quadracel\u00ae) which is a reported agent in 8.4% of all AEFI s. However , the vaccine accounts for 0.6% of all of the vaccine doses distributed by OGPMSS. DTaP -IPV also had the highest agent -specific re porting rate in 2012 (103.9 per 100 000 doses distributed). There are a number of factors to consider when interpreting this reporting Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 23 rate. There were a number of AEFIs reported following administration of DTaP -IPV to individuals who were over the age of 7 and therefore outside the indicated age for this vaccine. For example, w hen AEFI s reported following administration of DTaP -IPV to individuals over the indicated age for the vaccine (i.e. >7 years) are excluded , the reporting rate decreased to 88.2 per 100 000 doses distributed. The reporting rate may also be over -estimated due to limited distribution of DTaP -IPV vaccine in 2012 (Tdap - IPV [Adacel -Polio\u00ae ] became available for the four - to six-year- booster in April 2012) , combined with continued use of o utstanding stock of this vaccine or reporting errors if DTaP -IPV was selected as the agent in iPHIS rather than Tdap-IPV. The latter error was minimized during the data -cleaning process by manual validation of agent -lot-number combinations . In order to further assess the impact of the change from DTaP -IPV to Tdap -IPV on reporting rates in 2012 we assessed the reporting rate for DTaP - IPV over a longer period of time including 2009 -11 in which DTaP -IPV was the primary vaccine used for the four - to six -year booster. Between Jan uary 1, 2009 and April 30, 2013 , the AEFI reporting rate for DTaP -IPV was 38.1 per 100 000 doses distributed .33 Although this reporting rate is still elevated compared with Tdap -IPV, it is considerably lower than the 2012 estimate. This further suggest s that vaccine distribution patterns had a role in elevating the DTaP -IPV reporting rate in 2012. Regardless , the relatively high frequency of DTaP -IPV reports is consistent with the safety profile of DTaP -IPV vaccine which is known to produce large local reactions in a sizable proportion of recipients (15-20%), as well as the less common reaction of extensive limb swelling (2 -6%).34-37 This event is not associated with significant pain, limitation of recreational activities in the child or negative parental attitudes about the vaccine.38 The increasing trend towards local reactions after the fourth and fifth doses of DTaP vaccines 34 is reflected in a high frequency of AEFI reports following this vaccine observed in other passive AEFI surveillance systems.23 The frequency and reporting rate of AEFI s reported following Tdap -IPV is comparatively low , which may reflect a delay in uptake of this vaccine relative to distribution as well as a more favourable safety profile with respect to frequency of local reactio ns. However, a more in -depth analysis would be required to assess the impact on AEFI reporting due to the replacement of DTaP -IPV with Tdap -IPV vaccine for the four - to six-year booster. Reporting rates vary widely by agent. Aside from DTaP -IPV discussed a bove, the second and third highest AEFI reporting rates are from rabies and BCG vaccines ; however , reporting rate s may be unstable due to the low number of AEFI reports for these agents (one and four respectively) . Of note, the next highest reporting rates are from agents that are generally administered by PHUs in the school - based adolescent program s: HB, HPV4 and Men -C-ACWY. This suggests that reporting rates of AEFI s from PHU- administered programs may be higher than from vaccine programs traditionally adm inistered by other providers; however , further analysis is required to fully understand AEFI reporting patterns by agent, immunization provider and reporting source. In general, interpretation of the AEFI reporting rate by all agents and by specific agen t is limited by the lack of comparison to previous years. It is expected that subsequent annual reports will allow a comparison of reporting rates over time which will contribute to the interpretation of agent -specific AEFI trends. As previously noted, vac cine distribution patterns may not reflect vaccine administration patterns resulting in either over - or under -estimation of the reporting rate. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 24 The frequency of reported event categories suggests a high burden of reporting of injection -site reactions which were present in almost half of all AEFI reports. In particular, an injection -site reaction of \"Pain/redness/swelling lasting less than four days \" was present in 9.7% of reports compared with \"Pain/redness/swelling lasting greater than four days, \" present in 19.3% of reports. Given the high reporting burden of injection -site reactions within the surveillance system, changes were implemented on Jan uary 1, 2013, which included the discontinuation of reporting of injection -site reactions lasting less than 4 da ys. In addition , further differentiation of these injection -site reactions through the recent addition of \" Pain/redness/swelling lasting 4 to 10 days \" and \"Pain/redness/swelling lasting 10 days or greater \" will assist in assessing the burden of injection -site reporting within the surveillance system. Injection -site reactions will continue to be assessed to determine if further changes are necessary g iven that injection -site reactions (redness/pain/swelling) are relatively frequent events following all vaccines and are not considered a contraindication to further immunization .. \"Other severe/unusual events\" were also selected in a high proportion (19.5%) of reports. The frequent use of this value may be related to an important limitation of iPHIS prior to January 1, 2013. During this time, the list of available adverse event values within iPHIS did not correspond directly to provincial AEFI surveillance case definitions which led to frequent use of the \"Other severe/unusual events\" category to capture all o ther events that did not fit with existing event categories.13 As a result, events in this category should not be interpreted as severe nor do they necessarily meet the definition of a serious AEFI. This issue was also demonstrated in the HPV AEFI assessm ent in which 26% of reports between 2007 and 2011 were classed as \"Other severe/unusual events ,\" while further assessment of these report s showe d that many were misclassified.39 With the implementation of updated and aligned iPHIS adverse -event values and case definitions at the beginning of 2013, the proportion of reports with this event selected has already decreased. It is expected that the frequency of this value will continue to decrease in subsequent years. The proportion of s erious AEFIs occurring in this report is similar to a recent HPV4 AEFI assessment using iPHIS data (8.9% vs. 7.5% respectively) (13). Also similar is t he proportion of reports classified as \"Serious \" from the passive AEFI surveillance system in Australia (7%) ; whereas , the proportion from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) in the United States is higher (13%).23, 40 While the core definition of serious used by all three systems is the same (i.e. , event associated with disability, hospitalization, life -threatening illness or death), there are likely differences in classification based on the data available within each system. For ins tance, there is no field in iPHIS that accurately captures disability or permanent sequelae resulting from a reported event which may lead to underestimation of this outcome. In addition, the list of \"medically important events \" included in the definition of serious may vary by jurisdiction. Although the number of anaphylaxis reports that met the Brighton case definition was low, it should be noted that missing or incomplete information in reports of anaphylaxis is an important limitation to assessing these reports retrospectively. In addition, it is not possible to ascertain if some reports that did not meet the Brighton case definition were true anaphylactic events since epinephrine was Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 25 administered and subsequently altered the progression of the event. It is expected that changes to AEFI surveillance guidelines implemented on Jan uary 1, 2013, will improve monitoring and investigation of suspected anaphylactic reactions ; however , continued focus on obtaining detailed event descriptions is required. Guided r eporting tools may assist with specific data capture that is necessary for assessment of events managed as anaphylaxis.41 Just less than half of all AEFI reports to PHUs were made by individuals other than physicians and other health care providers , suggesting some degree of under -reporting given the reporting mandate for health care providers under the HPPA. Further evidence of this is seen when comparing the number of AEFI reports in which some medical consultation was sought (76%) with the number of reports reported by physicians (38%). Limitations Limitations of this analysis include those which are shared with other passive AEFI surveillance systems , including under -reporting, inconsistent quality and completeness of AEFI reports , and reporting b ias.42 As such, some variables may be either missing/incomplete , including dose number, time to onset and duration of the event, complete description of the reaction, treatment, and outcome. Specific limitations and their impact on interpretation have been included, where relevant. Currently, Ontario does not have a comprehensive population -based immunization registry to estimate the total cohort of vaccine recipients and subsequently the population -based rate of AEFI s for specific vaccine -event pairs . Instead, the AEFI reporting rate is calculated using the total population or doses distributed to the publicly funded program as the denominator which enables comparison of rates over time and to other jurisdictions . As this is the first annual report on vacc ine safety that has been completed in Ontario, there is limited analysis on trends over time. As previously described, there were substantial changes to AEFI surveillance in the province implemented during the period of time in which the AEFI s in this report were investigated and entered into iPHIS. Where relevant, the impact on interpretation has been noted ; however , there may also be an impact on the comparability of this data to subsequent years. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 | 26 Conclusions and R ecommendations This report presents the first annual assessment of vaccine safety in Ontario . It fulfils the province's important vaccine -safety surveillance objective of reporting to stakeholders on the safety of publicly funded vaccines , as well as contributing to public and professional confidence in vaccines. Overall, AEFI reports have increased in 2012 compared to the previous two y ears ; however , the rate of reporting relative to population size in Ontario is lower than some other Canadian jurisdictions. AEFI reports by specific agent are primarily driven by the volume of vaccine distribut ed. Reported events were consistent with the safety profile of many vaccines in which injection -site reactions are most frequent. It is expected that the implementation of revised case definitions and specific adverse event criteria on Jan uary 1, 2013 , will improve the characterization of AEFI s by event type over time. We recommend the following actions to continue to improve the quality of vaccine safety surveillance in Ontario . 1. Continue to produce a report that assesses AEFI reports on an annual basis, using an iPHIS data extraction date of May 1 for all AEFI s reported following vaccines administered in the previous calendar year and after an annual data -cleaning process to ensure consistency and comparability of data over time. 2. Develop and implement a knowledge translation plan for the annual repo rt which includes distribution of an annual vaccine safety report to public health units (P HUs), health professionals and members of the public to contribute to openness and transparency of the vaccine safety surveillance system in Ontario 3. Implement an ana phylaxis reporting tool to improve the quality and completeness of reporting of events managed as anaphylaxis and aid in provincial assessment and classification of these events using standard, internationally accepted criteria. 4. Further explore possible ex planations for under -reporting of AEFI s and recommend strategies to improve reporting rates in Ontario.
