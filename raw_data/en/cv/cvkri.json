Zidovudine (brand name: Retrovir) is a prescription medicine approved by the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration](/custom-ajax/get-dialog-content) (FDA) for the following uses: - To treat HIV infection in adults, children, and infants. When zidovudine is used to treat HIV infection, the medicine is always used in combination with other HIV medicines. - To prevent mother-to-child [transmission](/custom-ajax/get-dialog-content)( [perinatal transmission](/custom-ajax/get-dialog-content)) of HIV. When used to prevent mother-to-child transmission, zidovudine is given to women with HIV during pregnancy and childbirth and to their infants after birth. Although zidovudine is FDA-approved, it is no longer commonly used or recommended as an HIV treatment in adults and adolescents. The [Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Adults and Adolescents with HIV](/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-adult-and-adolescent-arv/appendix-b-drug-characteristics-tables?view=full#table3) no longer contain detailed or updated information on the use of zidovudine. Please refer to the FDA drug labels ( [capsule, oral solution, injection [solution]](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=6df09f15-b102-431c-adde-d7aeef6f5d84); [tablet](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=ca9f0c57-fc8b-4da4-a987-0fc52b7fd4f4)) for additional information regarding the use of zidovudine in people with HIV. For more information on the use of zidovudine in children and infants with HIV, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection](/en/guidelines/pediatric-arv/zidovudine?view=full). For more information on the use of zidovudine to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, please refer to the [Recommendations for the Use of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States](/en/guidelines/perinatal/whats-new). HIV medicines cannot cure HIV/AIDS, but taking HIV medicines every day helps people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. HIV medicines also reduce the risk of HIV transmission. If you are taking HIV medicines, do not cut down on, skip, or stop taking them unless your health care provider tells you to. Zidovudine may also be used to treat some conditions associated with [human herpesvirus 8](/custom-ajax/get-dialog-content) (HHV-8) infection in people with HIV. For more information, please refer to the [HHV-8 section](/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infections/human-herpesvirus?view=full) of the Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV.
