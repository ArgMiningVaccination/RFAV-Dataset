Maybe there was a fight, or something strange happened, but you can sense it. You want to get out of that place or \"purify\" that negative energy. - You're suffering from allergies or have a cold or a sinus infection, and you can't breathe, your nose and sinuses are stuffed and congested. You feel the urge to look for something that can clean those breathing passages. - You try to concentrate, you're overthinking, you need to clear your mind so that you can be able to focus and be more alert. You need something to clear your mind and help you think better. "}
