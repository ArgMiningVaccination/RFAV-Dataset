When it's time to inject, consider these tips and tricks from real caregivers who worked with their healthcare providers to create injection routines. - Children feed off your emotional state, so if you're calm and encouraging, the process can be less stressful. - Be fully prepared ahead of time and create a routine you can follow every injection. - Telling stories, singing songs, or silly rhymes are great ways to keep children preoccupied during the injection. - Sometimes providing a reward works well\u2014but sometimes a little quality one-on-one time is incentive enough.

Transcript: VO: LORI: Nobody prepares you for this. Right? We were lucky to have a great healthcare provider who trained us on the injection process, including how much to inject and how often. WENDY: It's definitely been a learning curve, learning how to administer an injection to my granddaughter. RAHMEL: I was a little overwhelmed in the beginning, but I found being calm is super important. My daughter Kia and I practice ways to keep calm. We like taking deep, long breaths together before we start. DEANTRE: I always told parents just to have a plan because kids pick up on your nervousness. If you're calm, they're calm. AMANDA: That's for sure. A lot of kids do well with a little calm chit chat, but others could benefit from other activities. So you want to have a few options ready ahead of time. LORI: I tried all sorts of things before we got into a comfortable routine. Distractions with toys, holding an ice cube to the injection site and having him get involved in the process like getting a cotton ball or an alcohol wipe. I've learned the best distraction is other family members. His older sister tells the best jokes. WENDY: And it can change as they get older. My granddaughter, Emma, didn't want anything to do with the pre injection process when she was younger. But now, helping out really gives her a sense of control. She gets the alcohol swabs and I get the medication from the fridge. DEANTRE: Where and when you administer the injection is important as well. LORI: Exactly. Eventually, we found doing the injection at the kitchen table allowed us to maintain Austin's bedroom and playroom as play spaces. I don't know why it worked, but we just stuck with it. AMANDA: Well, the kitchen is the heart of the home. LORI: Yeah. Maybe that's why. RAHMEL: It's because the cookies are closer. LORI: Yes. I can just grab one. Yeah. DEANTRE: One thing I also tell parents to patients is practice patience, because you got to realize that these are young people that we're dealing with. CHRISTINE: I always like to give as many options as possible and just trying to get them involved in the process so they have some control of something that they have no control over really. WENDY: Yeah. A lot of times I would say, \"Do you want to do this before breakfast or after dinner?\" CHRISTINE: Right. WENDY: And giving them that choice of the time of day. I'm finally comfortable giving the injections. But my granddaughter, Emma, is such a trooper sometimes I forget she's still just a little girl and she could use some reassurance. AMANDA: Always remember, uncertainty can cause anxiety. I always tell parents and caregivers a little encouragement and understanding goes a long way. CHRISTINE: I know a swaddle really helps. You can leave out the arm you're going to use and swaddle the rest of the body. This works for bigger kids also actually, if you use a blanket or something. LORI: Yeah, I know. They're stronger than we think. CHRISTINE: Yeah, we have to get them more credit. Kids are really resilient. DEANTRE: Look, when it comes to the actual injection, your physical technique is important. Leg and arm hold methods are simple to learn and reduce squirming. Don't forget to refer to any instructions for use before any injection, for additional information and to use as a reference. CHRISTINE: And there's so many options out there now. You can numb with an ice cube. They have devices that divert pain signals, it like vibrates on your arm so they don't feel the injection so much. They have numbing creams, numbing sprays. LORI: Right. CHRISTINE: There's so many things and every child is going to want something different. Some don't want anything at all. LORI: Yes. WENDY: Yeah. My granddaughter's really into the imagination type style, so it always involved her stuffed animals and unicorns and the fake shot injection. And it's like, Okay, if I'm getting this, then so is Panda, so is Uni. It was like, Okay, well who's going first and it just created almost like a magical land for her and she just really seemed to enjoy it more. RAHMEL: At first, simply explaining what I was doing and how the treatment was going to help calmed my daughter down. She's really into taking an active role in managing her condition. CHRISTINE: One thing I would suggest is to let your child's likes lead the way. If they like music, sing a song with them while giving the injection. If they like stories, have them read one to you or read one to them. If they're younger, just counting numbers or reciting the alphabet can help. Even having blankey or lovey dedicated to the injection time can be very comforting. LORI: Great point. Our son loves superheroes, so I made up a superhero. His name is Flash Bang. DEANTRE: Flash Bang. LORI: And I tell him a two minute story when I give the injection. Now he looks forward to new episodes so much. He reminds me as we get ready, which makes everything easier. WENDY: The basics work for us, the calm chit chat, and then using toys and screens as a distraction. Sometimes even a nursery rhyme. DEANTRE: You know what? Parents have an advantage. When we work with young patients, we have to earn their trust. You guys already have it. Be calm, confident, positive as you give the injection, eventually it'll become routine. LORI: We use screen time as a reward. It helps make it a positive experience and gives them something to look forward to after the injection. CHRISTINE: Rewards after the injection are a great idea. WENDY: Yes. It was important for me to get to know Emma's likes and dislikes. It's tough though because they changed so often. One day, bringing her giant stuffed panda into the room worked like a charm and the next it didn't. Sparkly stars and unicorn stickers though, that's where we're at now. RAHMEL: We're all so busy with work and school schedules, we make the reward all about spending time together with a game or movie night and she gets to pick the game or movie. She beat me last time too. AMANDA: Don't let yourself get too stressed out about the reward thing. I have a lot of little patients that react to very simple stuff. New, fun bandaids, extra hugs, sometimes simple is best. LORI: Throwing in a few sweets never hurts. I like to mix up the rewards that way he's looking forward to finding out what the next reward will be. It makes it feel like a celebration. RAHMEL: I mean, this has definitely been great sharing this experience with the other caregivers. LORI: Yes, so helpful. RAHMEL: Especially healthcare professionals, you guys have just made this process so much easier. So many new tools for my toolbox that'll make this whole process much better. LORI: I'm glad we were able to get together and do this for them.

KATHY: Hey there, I'm Kathy. Like you, I have a pretty busy life. Between running my own business and keeping up with my two teenagers at home, I'm always trying to stay on top of things. So, when my doctor prescribed DUPIXENT for my severe atopic dermatitis and told me I'd need to inject under my skin every two weeks, I knew I'd have to find a way to make it part of my routine. I wanted to stay on track with my DUPIXENT, since it helps me manage my eczema symptoms. I know how it feels to have those itchy, scaly, dry patches on my skin and that horrible crawling sensation under my skin. I had to make my treatment with DUPIXENT a priority. So, I started putting reminders notifications in my calendar. It's something simple, I know, but given everything I'm juggling on a daily basis, it ensures that I always know when it's time for my injection. As a backup, I asked a few of my family members to follow up with me every two weeks. Not only does this help keep me on track, but it's comforting to know that my family is there for me and I'm not having to go through this alone. And there's always DUPIXENT MyWay. The team there actually calls as a reminder when it's time for an injection and when it's time to order another monthly shipment. It's nice to know that these types of support are available, too. My advice? When it comes to taking DUPIXENT, it's important to stay on track by setting up a routine that works for you. So that's a little something I've learned in my DUPIXENT journey.
