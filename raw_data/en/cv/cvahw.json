If you're looking for ways to add more fresh fruits and vegetables to your diet, come see us. In the Hy-Vee Kitchen, a couple of the tasty new salads I created have become big hits with shoppers. I developed a Farro Salad made with barley, blueberries, mangos, red pepper and naturally sweet salad dressing. The taste is very fresh and light. I also came up with a new Asian Quinoa Salad. Naturally, I cook a lot at home for my girls. They are 3 and 8, so they are in the chicken nugget phase. When serving them, I include plenty of fresh veggies and sometimes freshly whipped mashed potatoes. We experiment with a lot of veggies. Our rule is they don't have to like every new food, but they have try it. It seems to be working. It certainly worked when I gave them asparagus. They love it!

Angela Williams Meat Service ManagerBlue Springs, MOA: Mushrooms are a rich source of vitamin D. Most Hy-Vee locations carry multiple varieties that can be used on all different types of dishes. I like some of the smaller kinds, like shiitake and porcini, because of the complex flavors. They are great in risottos and on gourmet pizzas. Chris Neal Asst.

Cut open a ripe mango and out wafts a spicy, peachy aroma as inviting as a tropical breeze. The tender, tangy fruit is an alluring blend of pineapple and peach, but it's sweeter than either. PHOTOS Cameron SadeghpourMANGOESIN SEASON SELECT When buying mangoes, rely on your eyes and nose. Look for undamaged, smooth-skinned fruit that yields to gentle pressure. A ripe mango feels soft to the touch and gives o a fl oral scent. STORE You can ripen mangoes on a counter for a few days. To speed up the process of getting them ready to eat, place them in a paper bag with an apple; apples emit ethylene, a gas that promotes ripening. Store your ripe mangoes in the refrigerator. PREP Use a paring knife or peeler to peel the skin o a mango. Set the fruit on its base and look at the shape from above. The fruit has two rounded sides and two fl atter sides. In one slice, carefully cut o one of the rounded sides, avoiding the seed. Cut o the other rounded side, then the fl atter sides. SEASONS 3:48 PMDID YOU KNOW? APART FROM BEING TASTY AND COLORFUL, MANGOES ARE LOADED WITH GOOD NUTRITION. THEY'RE HIGH IN VITAMINS A AND C, FIBER AND ANTIOXIDANTS. USES FOR MANGOES Get to know the fruit by eating it raw in the same way as a peach or papaya. A rmer mango usually tastes slightly more tart and citrusy. A riper mango has a softer texture and sweeter taste. Blend mango with other fruits, such as strawberries, kiwi, oranges, peaches and pineapple. Slice a mango and serve over mixed greens splashed with bottled raspberry vinaigrette. Grill mango slices to pair with sh, pork or poultry. Skewer several spears together and place on grill rack during the last few minutes of grilling. MANGO SMOOTHIES Fresh, ripe mango is luscious pureed in drinks with low-fat yogurt. When fresh isn't available, substitute frozen mango chunks, which may result in a thicker smoothie.

It was just a small corner tucked out of the way. Times have changed. Today's HealthMarkets are more like a store-within-a-store with their own brands, foods, buzzwords and growing clientele. \"It's huge now. It's become a leading area within the store,\" says Gayle Semple, opposite center, Hy-Vee HealthMarket manager in Olathe, Kansas. Everything about the HealthMarket seems familiar\u2014 yet somehow different. Like any department, there are long aisles of neatly displayed boxes, cans, bags and bottles. These look similar to the products lining shelves throughout the store, but they are specialty products. HealthMarket dairy cases stock organic yogurt, milk and cheeses. It's also easy to find organic soy milk and rice milk, as well as cereal and breakfast bars. You can even pick up organic meats, including ground beef and chicken, in the HealthMarket. Organic laundry supplies and body care products are also available. Because \"all natural\" and organic items mingle on Hy-Vee shelves, check labels carefully. To be labeled \"100 percent organic,\" a product must be certified by the United States Department of Agriculture as free of harmful pesticides and other toxins. If labeled \"organic,\" 95 percent of ingredients must be organic and the remaining ingredients cannot be available as organic. Another HealthMarket term you'll see is \"gluten- free,\" which is a common phrase on packaging in the department. There are gluten-free cereals, gluten-free frozen pizzas and microwavable chicken dinners, gluten-free veggie chips and many more. The demand for gluten-free has skyrocketed with an increase in the number of people diagnosed with Some Hy-Vee HealthMarket shoppers want to eat healthier, others have medical concerns. Regardless, you'll be eating better after just one visit. celiac disease, a condition where a person can't tolerate consuming gluten, found in wheat and other grains. The HealthMarket is a great resource for people with other diet restrictions too. \"If you have diabetes, need a low-sodium diet or have some other condition, we also stock what you need. We have all the foods needed for weight-loss diets, as well,\" Gayle says. STOCKING UP Scanning the HealthMarket shelves is an education in healthy eating. Some examples are: Flours. Instead of the wheat flours seen in other aisles, gluten-free flours are available here, including varieties made from rice, corn, beans or other foods. General-purpose blends of gluten-free flour are also popular. Blends are formulated to improve baked goods made with gluten-free flour, instead of wheat flour. Organics. There are boxed organic soups and chicken broth, organic children's cereals in animal-character packaging, organic teas and more. Dairy and frozen. A wall of cold cases and freezers holds items such as organic eggs from cage-free chickens, organic milk, organic yogurt and a variety of organic and gluten-free frozen dinners. Bulk dry goods. These sections may include many organic options, from roasted sunflowers and popcorn to basmati rice, quinoa and almonds. MEET A DIETITIAN If you're new to the HealthMarket and have questions about healthy eating, ask a Hy-Vee dietitian. They are often available in the HealthMarket or ask for a dietitian at the Customer Service counter. Services offered by these nutrition experts include educational store tours and health screenings. As Hy-Vee director of health and wellness, Julie McMillin keeps her fingers on the pulse of the 160 HealthMarkets now in operation. \"In just the last year, we expanded them into 50 more stores and we plan to put them in another 50 this year,\" she says. Shelves in each location have been filled with products that are natural, organic and healthy. But higher standards are coming, and soon there will be no HealthMarket products containing artificial sweeteners, added flavors or anything that doesn't offer a health advantage. In the face of increasing childhood obesity, there will also be a push for better nutrition for children. \"We want our HealthMarkets to help families pack healthy lunches and create healthy meals,\" Julie says.HEALTHMARKET REPORT SEASONS | hy-vee.com 11 010-011 OurBest2_11-14_02.indd 11 12/1/14 12:07 PMBuy Hy-Vee One Step Water and provide funds so others can have clean water too. Over the last two years, One Step Water sales have paid for digging 11 wells and water systems in Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean. Now in its third year, the pace of drilling is picking up as more water projects come on line. But the task is not an easy one. \"In all the countries we work, communications take time because of distances,\" says Brad Waller, Hy-Vee assistant vice president of community relations. Water sales are just one way projects are funded through One Step. Other ways the fundraiser helps are: One Step Russett Potatoes. Proceeds will help fund 500 community gardens this year. Money raised from One Step potato sales also goes to a nutrition education program for children. \"It's surprising how many kids think that food just comes out of a can they see on a shelf and don't make the connection to growing food,\" Brad says.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention water helps your body in ve ways: 1. Maintains normal temperature 2. Lubricates and cushions joints 3. Protects your spinal cord and sensitive tissues 4. Rids the body of waste 5. Encourages weight loss The health benets of drinking water inspired a national campaign called Drink Up. As honorary chair of the Partnership for a Healthier America, First Lady Michelle Obama supports the water campaign and encourages everyone to increase their average intake of water by at least one glass a day. 012-017 Ad_101_Opener_Final.indd 12 12/1/14 3:51 PMThe best part about making your own pasta\u2014besides how good it tastes\u2014is that you can incorporate an array of fresh veggies, herbs and high-quality fl ours to boost vitamins and ber amounts.

You need about 4 quarts water and 3 tablespoons of salt for every 13 to 18 ounces of fresh pasta. Using a large volume of water prevents the pasta from sticking together. Stir the pasta only once or twice. Quickly bring the water back to a boil; stir and continue to boil, uncovered, until pasta is al dente, or firm to the bite, 2 to 4 minutes, depending on the size and freshness of the pasta. Immediately drain the pasta. Serve the hot pasta immediately with your favorite sauce. Or drizzle olive oil or melted butter over the pasta and toss in fresh herbs. 012-017 Ad_101_Opener_Final.indd 15 12/1/14 6:58 PMLand O'Frost Premium or Simply Delicious Sliced Lunch Meat: select varieties 9 to 16 oz. $4.48 Sea Cuisine Encrusted Fish Fillets: select varieties 8.5 or 10 oz. $6.48Flatout Wraps or Foldit's Flatbread: select varieties 8.5 to 14 oz.Fast Fixin' Breaded Chicken Bags: select varieties 20 or 24 oz. $3.48 Crunchtables Coated Vegetables: select varieties 10 oz. $2.28 Crunchtables Coated Wimmer's Natural Casing Dinner Sausage and Little Smokies: select varieties 13 or 14 oz. $3.88 Wimmer's Big 'N Meaty Summer Sausage: select varieties 20 oz. $5.48 Wimmer's Big 'N Meaty Weight Watchers Chicken: select varieties 30 or 32 oz. $6.99A meal featuring succulent chicken breasts now matches your desire to eat healthy, despite your hectic schedule.

Source: Center for Disease Control and Prevention 018-025 Start to a New You_Final.indd 21 12/2/14 12:51 PM Fat is listed on food labels in grams. One gram of fat equals 9 calories. You need 44 to 78 grams a day, mostly unsaturated fats, according to the Mayo Clinic.good fats vs. bad fats (and how to tell the difference) You need some fat every day. It should make up 20 to 35 percent of your recommended daily calories. Without fat your body can't function, says Martha Harrou , a dietitian at Hy-Vee drugstores in Cedar Rapids and Marion. But not just any fats will do. Most of your fat should come from plant-based sources. These are poly- and monounsaturated fats that can improve your cholesterol levels and overall health. One rule of thumb is that if a fat is liquid at room temperature, it's probably better for you. If it's solid, it's a saturated fat, usually animal-based or from coconut. Saturated fats have been implicated in multiple diseases. Martha recommends limiting saturated fats to less than 10 percent of your daily fat total. Read food labels and limit your intake of products with saturated fats, trans fats and hydrogenated oils. What about products that claim to burn fat? While there's no evidence they are harmful, most studies nd them ine ective. a cartful of good foods Fat calories add up fast, even when they come from healthy foods. Here are dietitian recommendations. 1/ NUTS: All types of nuts are heart-healthy. Look for unsalted raw or dry-roasted nuts. Avoid oil-roasted varieties, which contain extra fat. Nuts help curb your appetite. A small handful is all you need to reap health bene ts. 2/ AVOCADOS: High in good monounsaturated fat, heart-healthy avocados help lower bad cholesterol and raise the good. They increase absorption of antioxidants. Use mashed avocados as a condiment in place of sour cream. 3/ OLIVE OIL: Besides its bene cial e ect on cholesterol, olive oil may help blood clotting. One tablespoon has 14 grams of fat and 119 calories. That's about 20 percent of the daily fat calories for an average-sized woman. 4/ PEANUT BUTTER: Choose natural nut butters without hydrogenated fats and trans fats. The fewer the number of ingredients, the more bene cial a nut butter will be for your health. 5/ SUNFLOWER SEEDS: The type of fat found in seeds and nuts helps you feel full and satis ed. Seeds are rich in essential fatty acids that can't be made by the body. A small handful is plenty. 6/ SOY MILK:Soy milk has 4.2 grams of fat per cup. It o ers more protein than almond milk.7/ TOFU:When eaten in moderation, tofu can be used to replace less healthful choices. Tofu contains 6 grams of fat per serving, plus healthy protein. 8/ TUNA AND SALMON: The best source of omega-3 fatty acids are these fatty fish. These health-food superstar help curb inflammation, lower blood fats called triglycerides, slow plaque buildup in arteries and lower blood pressure. 9/ CANOLA OIL: Even better than olive oil for health, canola has less saturated fat than any other commonly used oil. A monounsaturated fat, it works well for cooking at high heat. 35% THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICAN ADULTS WHO ARE OBESE.

Such health issues include diabetes, heart disease, obesity and some cancers. \"While some people love the nutty flavor of whole wheat pasta, I prefer my pasta to taste like what I grew up with,\" Kimberly says. If you are in that camp, she suggests starting with a multigrain (rather than whole wheat) pasta, such as the Hy-Vee Omega-3 Multigrain Pasta. \"When used in your favorite pasta recipes, it will produce the same dishes you always enjoyed, but with much better nutrition,\" Kimberly says.

She shares her recipes, along with her exercise tips and travel stories, on her runaway-hit blog, IowaGirlEats.com. A recent diagnosis of celiac disease has brought a new angle to Kristin's food-loving life. \"Going gluten-free has forced me to rethink everything I eat,\" she says. \"I'm more aware of the impact that food has on our bodies, and as a result I now enjoy more fresh produce, seafood and high-quality protein, and less sugar and processed foods than ever before.\"When it comes to pasta, Kristin continues to partake with gusto. \"I don't miss regular pasta at all,\" she says. \"Pizza? Maybe. Pasta? I haven't had to miss out because of all the great gluten-free options available today.\" She enjoys switching in spaghetti squash as a healthy alternative to traditional pasta. But when she's craving real pasta, she reaches for Barilla gluten-free pasta. \"It's nearly indistinguishable from the real thing,\" she says.

PREP ARE YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR HOME FOR THE B UNDLE OF JOY THAT WILL B E ARRIVING SOON. WORDS Andrea Cooley PHOT OS Tobin Bennett Forty weeks may seem like a long time to wait for a baby to be born, but it oers parents a chance to get ready for the newest addition to your family. Make the most of it! HELP AT HY-VEE Look to Hy-Vee for help as your everyday partner in providing the necessities for you, your family and your new baby. Here are a few ways we offer support.Dietitians: H y-Vee dietitians are available to help expectant moms make the best choices in healthy foods, whether your focus is supporting your baby or dietary restrictions you may have due to gestational diabetes or other conditions. One of the most valuable dietitian services is a Hy-Vee store tour, during which you learn how to select the most nutritious foods for your family's health. After your baby is born, ask your dietitian for guidance about what to eat while breastfeeding and what to eat while working to get your pre-pregnancy body back. Pharmacists: T he staff at your Hy-Vee Pharmacy is there for you before and after delivery. Look to this department for items needed to care for your pre- and post-delivery body. Reduce the number of errands your first week with the new baby by getting items you need beforehand, such as a baby thermometer or pediatrician-advised pain relievers. As baby grows, the Pharmacy offers a host of prescription and nonprescription products needed, as suggested by your pediatrician.Baby Savings Program: Shopping and saving just got easier. A new Hy-Vee program saves money on all baby-related purchases while working in tandem with the Fuel Saver program. No additional sign-up is needed; simply make sure your Fuel Saver account's contact information is current. When you purchase baby items, you may receive oers in the mail or via email for additional discounts. These may include gift cards, special pricing, coupons or extra Fuel Saver incentives. Mother's Rooms: Need a few minutes in private to nurse your baby or to take care of a toddler's needs? Mother's Rooms, see opposite, are available in many Hy-Vee stores.New Mom Parking: Easy access to the store makes life a little easier, especially with a newborn in tow. Look for signs marking the New & Expectant Mom parking spots at most Hy-Vee stores. Once your baby comes, take the heavy lifting out of shopping by picking up your groceries at store drive-throughs. BEFORE BABY ARRIVES Stock up on healthy snacks to help curb hunger and supply good nutrition when you're too busy to eat. Focus your nesting instinct on filling the freezer and pantry with heat-and-serve meals. Learn about time-saving heat-and-serve meals you can make and freeze. See the story \"Freeze Frame\" in Hy-Vee Seasons Holiday 2013, which can be downloaded at www.hy-vee.com/seasons/past-issues.aspx Stock up on diapers and wipes; bottles and formula, if needed; baby lotion and soap; and baby-safe laundry detergent. Big ticket items such as a must-have car seat, stroller or crib require research. These items are critical to ensure the safety of your child, so spend time checking websites for government safety guidelines, product recall information and advice for new parents. Ask your doctor and knowledgeable parents you know for their suggestions. Purchase items ahead of your delivery date and install the car seat following the manufacturer's instructions three weeks before your due date. Because about 75 percent of car seats are not installed correctly, fire stations will inspect care-seat installation for free. SEASONS | Health 2015 46 046-049 Modern Motherhood_New4wandatext.indd 46 12/1/14 5:00 PMHY-VEE MOTHER'S ROOMS Babies need special attention even when you're grocery shopping. If you're a mother seeking a calm spot for a few minutes with a little one, a Hy-Vee Mother's Room is just the place. Available in many Hy-Vee stores, this cozy room gives moms a spot where children can be fed or other needs can be addressed. Each retreat is clean and quiet with a rocking chair, changing table, electrical outlets, children's toys and more. \"I absolutely love that you provide a Mother's Room for all of us,\" wrote a Kearney, Nebraska, shopper and mother on the Hy-Vee Facebook page. 046-049 Modern Motherhood_New4wandatext.indd 47 12/1/14 5:01 PMIN THE BABY AISLE Because a baby's needs only begin with food and diapers, Hy-Vee has greatly expanded the types of products stocked for growing families. For feeding time, new parents will nd baby food in jars, foods in squeeze bottles, boxes of creamy baby cereals and bags of nutritious snack foods for little ones. Parents will also nd an array of bottles and bottle nipples. To keep babies dry and happy, all major brands of diapers and wipes are o ered, along with diaper covers, rash ointments and bed pads. For bath time, there are quality soaps, shampoos and lotions to keep babies clean and comfortable. Should your baby seem fussy or ill, Hy-Vee stocks thermometers in the baby aisle. There are also over-the-counter medications in the Hy-Vee Pharmacy for every age group. Scan this QR code to watch the \"DIY Baby Food\" video on a smartphone or tablet. SEASONS | Health 2015 48 046-049 Modern Motherhood_New4wandatext.indd 48 12/2/14 1:09 PMAdditional baby supplies include items such as video monitors, bottle washers and a plethora of specialized baby gear. Purchasing these items is always a personal choice. Healthy, happy children have long been raised by caring parents who can only a ord the essentials. After baby arrives, ask for help from friends and family. Plan for your own daytime naps to make up for lost nighttime sleep and to speed recovery. SAFETY FIRST Get your home ready for curious little hands and feet by installing baby-proo ng devices. Keep baby out of danger from doors and heat by using appliance safety locks around stoves, refrigerators and dishwashers. To prevent other injuries, put plugs in electrical outlets and install locks on cabinet doors and drawers. Be sure cleaning supplies are securely locked away or stored beyond a baby's reach. If you have pets, it's a good idea to prepare pets for an infant. Create a quiet place where pets can hide when the baby cries. If you think your pet may not react well to a baby, work with a trainer. BABY'S FIRST BITES Just like you, babies crave a variety of tastes, textures and colors in food. Follow your doctor's advice for feeding your baby. Here's a general timeline for a child's eating changes during the rst 18 months. By about 6 months, introduce soft cereals, starting with rice or oatmeal. Progress onto pureed fruits and vegetables a few months later. Breastmilk or formula will remain a baby's main source of protein for about 12 to 18 months, but begin adding other sources of protein at about 6 to 9 months. Hy-Vee has a selection of baby foods, including organic varieties. You can also make your own baby food.

She didn't make the team but was happy to nd out soon after the race that her rst baby was on the way. Then her second baby arrived last summer. Ashley, an attorney in Des Moines, plans to put on her racing shoes again this summer at age 31. Barring any unexpected problems during the coming months, she will compete in June at Grandma's Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota. \"I'm so looking forward to it. Some people look at all I go through for a race and think I'm delusional. But it's so much more than a hobby to me. It's who I am. I love competing and pushing myself. It relieves stress for me,\" she says. \"And it's so easy. Just slip on a pair of shoes and you can run anywhere.\" In high school, she ran but set it aside at graduation. During her junior year at the University of Iowa, she realized how much she missed the challenge of competition and started running again. Soon, her interest turned into her passion. \"I wanted to get back in the race, even though I had gotten older, lost some speed and hadn't been training much,\" she says. \"So I shook off the cobwebs and jumped back into it. I thought, why not start my comeback with a marathon?\" Ashley admits her approach to training for the 26-mile race wasn't the best. \"I was kind of naive,\" she says. \"I just googled 'marathon training plans' and felt like I could make it work. Well, I stuck with it and, amazingly, it paid off.\" Through the years, she has competed in about a dozen marathons. In 2009, she formed a team with two other athletes and entered the Hy-Vee Triathlon. She raced in the event's running leg while her teammates handled the legs for swimmers and cyclists. 050-055 Race_Story.indd 51 12/1/14 4:06 PMSEASONS | Health 2015 52Starting in January, Ashley will increase her running distance to 80 to 84 miles a week to get ready for the June marathon. She also gives her body the nutrition, liquids and sleep it needs for a distance race, including: Healthy eating. \"I eat a lot of oatmeal, yogurt and English mufns with peanut butter and jelly. For dinner, I'll have sh and vegetables. Make sure you always try the foods you will eat before a race. You don't want any surprises,\" Ashley says. Staying hydrated. Ashley encourages athletes to drink plenty of water. \"It's a must.\" Getting adequate sleep. With small children, this can be challenging for Ashley, but it's critical for all athletes. GET STARTED One morning you wake up determined that this will be the day you'll start getting t and healthy. But you look in the mirror and you don't see an athlete. You see someone who enjoys dessert and sitting in front of a TV. So how will you ever reach your goal? Stay motivated by setting smaller, attainable goals rather than a large dream-sized goal. Don't focus on your future as an Olympian. Instead, train for this spring's Hy-Vee 5K Road Race. Set realistic weekly goals so you build up to the distance. Your condence will soar as you improve week by week. Need more motivation? Running is more fun if you hit the track with a partner. You can encourage each other and see that friendly competition can be very motivating. You'll quickly discover that there's a direct link between a healthier body and a healthier outlook on life. If motivation hits an all-time low, add different kinds of training to your routine. On off days, switch to: Suspension training to build core strength. Rock climbing to tone arm and back muscles. Push-ups, and jumping jacks for equipment-free aerobic excercise. By targeting muscles that aren't often affected by running, you are challenging your mind and body with something new that feeds into your overall tness for the 5K only weeks away. EXERCISE ON SCHEDULE Smart athletes run on a schedule, never leaving exercise to chance. Book your calendar with exact times, days and locations for training, and follow your workout plan. To track your training, use a tness app such as MapMyRun, Runtastic or RunKeeper. Each app keeps a record of your speed, distance traveled, calories burned and routes traversed. Using this data helps to tailor your tness plan to your specic goals.FUELING UP The rise in obesity indicates that many of us need to start training for our rst race. Healthy eating is a key to victory. \"Fueling the body is important before and after training, as well as for the competition itself,\" says Anne Hytrek, dietitian at Hy-Vee Ankeny #2, Iowa. \"One of the best aspects of my job is watching the impact that sound sports nutrition has on an athlete's mental and physical pursuit of optimal performance.\" Hy-Vee wants to get you in the race toward a healthier you. Go for your goal! \"THE VALUE OF NUTRITION CAN'T BE UNDERESTIMATED WHEN AN ATHLETE'S HYTREK, HY-VEE DIETITIA N, ANKENY, I OWA /six.lin SMART SNACK IDEAS FOR AFTER YOUR RUN After pounding the pavement, refuel with these easy go-to snacks. 1. CHOCOLATE MILK \"This is one of the best recovery snacks to re-fuel the muscles due to its perfect carbohydrate to protein ratio,\" says Hytrek. \"It is an affordable snack that is relatively easy to 'grab and go.'\"2. BANANAS Loaded with good carbs and B 6 vitamins, this fruit helps manage protein metabolism. Eat one for quick recovery.3. STRING CHEESE Runners need calcium for strong bones and protein for muscle building. String cheese provides both.4. GREEK YOGURT WITH FRUIT Protein is the fuel that drives an athlete. With twice as much protein as regular yogurt, Greek yogurt is an easy choice. A 6-ounce container of Greek provides up to 17 grams of protein. You'll feel the difference during your run and while recovering. 5. TURKEY, CHEESE AND APPLES Here's protein, healthy fat, and carbs in one simple snack. Layer sliced cheddar on apple wedges and wrap with turkey deli meat. 6. SALTED NUTS Boost electrolytes after sweating by eating a handful of salted nuts. It's a better option than most sports drinks.DRINK MORE WATER! Water does the body good, ridding it of toxins, keeping hunger in check, easing muscle cramps and aiding in digestion. Your body requires about 64 fluid ounces of H 2O a day when training; always keep a water bottle on hand so you can stay hydrated. Choose a portable bottle that's large enough to hold a day's worth in two or three llings. 050-055 Race_Story.indd 52 1:15 PMSEASONS | hy-vee.com the beginner's guide HANNAH HIGGINS AND KAL H OPPE There is no minimum age when it comes dedication and goal setting. Hannah Higgins, age 14, and Kal Hoppe, age 10, regularly compete in Hy-Vee's Road Race events, which are staged late spring through early fall throughout the Midwest. Both competitors began pounding the pavement when they were 6 years old. Now they're hooked on sports and fitness. \"Running is what motivates me,\" Hannah says. \"I get a feeling of accomplishment and that keeps me going and trying my best. I find running relaxes me when I'm stressed or energizes me when I'm tired.\" Kal also loves to run and trains every chance he gets. Impressively, he has already completed his first marathon (26.2 miles). The two youth are training for the 2015 Hy-Vee Kids Road Race Championship during the Drake Relays and won't let winter slow them down. Both brave the elements for training or switch to indoor treadmills when Mother Nature is just too harsh. Cross-training is part of their workout plans. Kal plays basketball while Hannah builds strength with downhill skiing and sledding with her sister and friends.CHRISTINE BRANDENB URG was not always an athlete. But at midlife she decided to get fit and began with a bevy of boot camps and dance classes, none of which produced the promised \"new you.\" Then four years ago, when asked by a friend to partner up for a half-marathon walk, she found her athletic calling: running. \"Walking wasn't enough; I found I wanted to run,\" says Christine, who works for a large insurance company. \"Having the race as an end goal really motivated me to get off the couch.\" Her goal has never been winning a race. Her aim is to be fit, active and healthy. \"When I look back to when I started running, I can see that I have a completely different mind-set now. Four years ago, I would have said, 'No, I can't do that. I can't be a runner.' But now it has made me more confident in myself. I have gained a lot.\" \"I'M NOT IN THIS TO FINISH FIRST; I'M RACING AGAINST MYSELF. IT'S ALL ABOUT REACHING MY OWN GOALS.\" - CHRISTINE BRANDENB URG, URBANDALE, I OWA RUNNER PROFILE In her late 40s, she made her rst race a half marathon, rather than the typical 5K and 10K races preferred by beginners.RUNNER PROFILE Hannah Higgins, above, raced at the 2014 Hy-Vee Kids Fit Triathlon in Des Moines last July.

For half of those, she paid 20 cents a gallon. For the other 20 ll-ups, she said the total bill was only a few cents! Her strategy for saving? Three simple steps: Look for Hy-Vee buys that come with Fuel Saver rewards. In addition to buying what her family needs, Sara makes bulk buys of items such as soap and shampoo, then donates them to local programs for the needy. \"I'm going to donate to them anyway, Fuel Saver is a bonus.\" Make room in the freezer when good deals are offered. Recently, Sara spent nearly $20 for 10 bulk packs of brand-name vegetables. The deal came with Fuel Saver points, an irresistible discount at the store and additional savings because she had a manufacturer's coupon. In the end, she got more than $2 off per gallon of gas and the veggies were practically free. Pay attention to all the Hy-Vee stores near you. Sara lives near three. \"I keep up with the sales and offers at all three of them. When the points are there, I make the drive.\"Jeanne Rashid shares a Mini Cooper with her 17-year-old triplet daughters, Isabell, Lily and Annaliese. As part of the deal, Jeanne also splits refueling with the girls. \"My husband and I pay for the gas when we rell and when the girls put in the gas, they get to use the Fuel Saver card,\" Jeanne says. \"They usually save about $20 on a $40 tank of gas.\" The girls also take care of the shopping sometimes and always watch for Fuel Saver bargains when they do. The Rashid story is similar to thousands of other stories. They shop as they have always shopped, but scan aisles for Fuel Saver shelf tags announcing special deals that come with Fuel Saver points. The oer is simple: Purchase a Fuel Saver product and lower your cost for gas. Savings range from a couple of cents o a gallon to savings that nearly cover the cost per gallon of fuel.

We've got it down to a science,\" he says. The couple shop for their usual items. But they also watch for Fuel Saver deals on the foods they prefer and would buy anyway. \"We buy what we normally buy, like fresh bread.

Like many regular Fuel Saver users, she scans weekly Hy-Vee ads for Fuel Saver specials. Using the Hy-Vee app on her phone, she can also sort ads for Fuel Saver rewards.

Make yourself a professor of protein with these facts. 01. ON-THE-GO FUEL There's no denying the convenience of energy bars. These pocket-sized snacks are easy to keep in a gym bag or purse, and have a much longer shelf life than other on-the-go options, such as a whole-wheat bagel or a ripe banana. 02. LOADED WITH FLAVOR Looking for something sweet? Satisfy your craving in a smarter way with a dessert inspired protein bar. Modeled after candy bars, many protein bars are fl avored with creamy peanut butter, fruit, chocolate or nuts. These bars taste like a treat but keep blood sugars and calories in check. 03. HOLDS OFF HUNGER Skipping a meal is the quickest way to kick your hunger into high gear. Once your stomach starts rumbling, good food choices are a challenge. With nutrition bars, it's easy to keep tasty, vitamin- and mineral-packed snacks on hand. For a normal busy day, seek a bar that has a calorie count of about 200 and at least 15 grams of protein. These amounts are close to what you would nd in a light breakfast, lunch or dinner. Athletes need higher counts. Meal replacement bars should contain a balance of protein, carbohydrates and fat to help sate your appetite. 04. HEALTHY BALANCE Many fad diets suggest stripping your diet of anything other than protein. However, protein does best for your body when it's balanced with two other macronutrients: carbohydrates and fats. Look for bars with all three for the best results on your overall health and energy levels. 05. SAY \"YAY\" FOR WHEY! A low-fat protein rich in amino acids, whey helps delay fatigue. Look for bars that list \"whey protein isolate\" or \"hydrolyzed whey protein\" at the beginning of their ingredients list. Avoid high amounts of \"whey protein concentrate,\" which is often used as ller. 06. MILK AND EGGS These do a body good when it comes to protein. Bars made with milk and eggs o er high-quality protein. 07. MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR SNOOZE TIME Eat protein bars high in casein before you hit the hay. Amino acids in casein, a protein that makes up about 80 percent of milk, are absorbed slowly by the body. This makes nighttime a prime time to speed up metabolism and shed fat. 08. GO NUTS FOR BARS WITH NUTS Almonds, walnuts, pecans and other shelled favorites o er powerful protein, as well as \"good fats,\" which can reduce the amount of bad cholesterol and increase the good. 09. A TASTY UNDERSTUDY Eat your oats. While not o ering a complete protein source, bars containing this grain are a healthy choice and the slow-digesting ber will keep you feeling full longer. 10. \"Protein is key for weight loss because it takes a long time to digest in our stomachs. Eating foods high in protein and ber provides a feeling of fullness that leaves us satis ed and energized throughout the day.\" \u2014Nicole Arnold, AMSOLUTIONS A VARIETY OF OVER-THE-COUNTER REMEDIES ARE AVAILABLE AT YOUR LOCAL HY- VEE PHARMACY.

TAKE STEPS NOW TO AVOID GETTING SICK SO YOU CAN RING IN THE NEW YEAR FEELING HEALTHY. As a way to stay healthy during the cold season, keep stress in check. Stress weakens your immune system and increases your risk of illness any time of year, says Hy-Vee pharmacist Lisa Linder. Remember that your body needs rest and care, and ignoring that fact will leave you vulnerable to sickness and may prolong your recovery time. Here are a few steps you can take to protect against illness: Get a vaccination. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends getting the annual flu shot as the best way to avoid the disease. Those at highest risk for the disease are children, pregnant women, those 65 years and older and those with chronic health conditions. Wash your hands. Frequent, thorough hand washing is one of the most effective ways to stay healthy. Disinfect your home. Wipe down doorknobs, scrub bathrooms and kitchens, wash bedding and more. Avoid close contact. Steer clear of people who exhibit coldlike symptoms. Soothing tea. For a cough or sore throat, drink a cup of hot tea with honey in it. Vitamin C. When your throat is scratchy and getting worse, take vitamin C to give your immune system a boost. ASK YOUR PHARMACIST Should a sickness knock you down, the pharmacists and staff at your Hy-Vee Pharmacy are ready to help. They can fill prescriptions from your doctor or help you select the most effective over-the- counter medications available for your condition. Refill prescriptions and check medication status online by establishing a My Hy-Vee account at www.hy-vee.com or get these same services through the free Hy-Vee app for smartphones. The Pharmacy also offers flu shots, hundreds of generic medications for $4, help with a medical Flexible Spending Account and more.

Also eat at least 4 grams of fiber, which helps you maintain a healthy weight and lowers risk of diabetes and heart disease. Oatmeal with fruit is a good choice, and even some grab-and-go breakfast bars and other prepared foods offer good numbers. 2 SNACK SENSIBLY Snacking between meals has its benefits, but only if you snack smart. Be mindful of how much you are eating. Keep healthy snacks handy so you aren't lured to a poor substitute. Nuts and dried fruits are good choices. 3 DITCH EMPTY CALORIES Sugary drinks are loaded with empty calories. Limit liquid calories by swapping sodas and sports drinks for fruit and vegetable juices or water. 4 FRESH-PICKED DIET Fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables at every meal. These foods will help you feel full while providing heaps of vitamins and nutrients. 5 SUGAR IS NOT THE ENEMY Put a limit on how much sugar you consume, but don't cut out sweets entirely. Satisfy your craving for sweets with fresh fruits! 6 ADD ACTIVITY Good health is more than the meals or snacks you eat. A healthy body also requires activity. You were made to move.
