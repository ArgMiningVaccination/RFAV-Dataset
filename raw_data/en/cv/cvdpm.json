As soon as the crystals were activated I felt a chaotic sensation in my chest and head, but throughout the session it calmed and I ended the treatment feeling more peaceful. Not sure if it is the same for everyone, but I believe that it provided me with a benefit I admittedly don't fully understand. Would recommend!
