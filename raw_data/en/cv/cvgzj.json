In the office we use herbs alone or in conjunction with acupuncture, especially if a patient is not able to receive consistent treatments in the beginning. Herbs can help the most common syndromes such as; common colds, throat and respiratory problems, stress, emotional problems, menstrual problems, and menopausal symptoms. Herbal medicine is based on the principles of energetics. Everything in the world is made up of moving atoms and therefore is mostly made of energy. Each natural product made on this planet has an energetic property. For instance, stones, minerals, and shells have very dense properties which contain slow moving atoms and can help for the purpose of grounding, slowing down, and cooling the body. There are many types of properties to each herb which can involve taste, weight, temperature, energetic pathway, and helping specific organs. Practitioners of traditional Chinese Medicine have studied these herbal properties and their effects on the human body for over 2,000 years. Our bodies require balance and herbs help maintain it. The closer our bodies are to balance, the healthier we are. Herbs are a great way to start getting healthy and staying healthy. Please let your herbalist know if you are a vegetarian or if you have any allergies so they can prescribe accordingly. "}
