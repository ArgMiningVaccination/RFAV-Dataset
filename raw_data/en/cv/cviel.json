The a.nnual reports are authorized by concurrent resolution from time to time and are published for the use of Congress and the Bureau; the publication of the series of bulletins was authorized by concurrent resolution first in 1886 and more definitely in 1888, and these also are issued for the use of Congress- and the Bureau. In addition, the Bureau supervises the publication of a series of quarto volumes bearing the title, \"Contributions to North American Ethnology,\" begun in 1877 by the United States Geographical Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region. These publications are distributed primarily by Congress, and the portions of the editions printed for the Bureau are used for exchange with libraries and scientific and educational institutions and with special investigators in anthropology who send their own publications regularly to the Bureau. The exchange list of the Bureau is large, and the product of the exchange forms a valuable ethnologic library independent of the general library of the Smithsoniau Institution. This library is in constant use by the Bureau collaborators, as well as by other anthropologists resident in or visiting Washington.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY, Washington, D. C., April 25, 1893. SIR: I have the honor to transmit to you the copy for \" Contributions to North American Ethnology, Vol. IX, Dakota Grammar, Texts, and Ethnography,\" by the late Stephen Return Riggs, having edited it according to your instructions. I am, with respect, your obedient servant, JAMES OWEN DORSEY, Ethnologist. To HON. J. W. POWELL, Director, Bureau of EthnologyPREFACE. By the Editor, JAMES OWEN DORSET. In consequence of the death of the author in 1883, the copy furnished by him for the present volume was left in such a shape that some editing was necessary before it could be sent to the printer. By order of the Director of the Bureau of Ethnology, the editorship of the manuscript was committed to me. I was requested also to prepare the table of contents and index, and to see that the arrangement of the chapters, headings, etc., conformed to the general plan of the publications issued by this Bureau. That such disposition of the manuscript was in harmony with the wishes of the author will appear after a perusal of the following extract from a letter, dated April 20, 1881, sent by Dr. S. R. Riggs to Mr. J. C. Pilling, then chief clerk of the Bureau. After speaking of an article that he was preparing, to be entitled \" Unwritten Laws,\" Dr. Riggs continues thus: \"This letter, I think, will partly cover Ethnology. But I do riot profess to be skilled in Ethnology as a science, and shall be glad of any suggestions from Maj. Powell and yourself.\" In the manuscript as received from the author were sundry quotations from my letters to him. But as several years had elapsed since these were written and as I had been enabled to revise the quoted statements, bringing the information down to date, it was but proper that such revisions should appear as footnotes, each followed by my initials. During the process of editing the manuscript it was ascertained that, as there had been additional investigations among the Dakota and other tribes of the Siouan stock since the death of the author, several questions treated by him deserved further elucidation. When one considers the many years in which the venerable author was associated with the work among the Dakota Indians (1837-1883) it would seem to many persons very pre- XIXII DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. sumptuous for one whose life among the Indians began as late as 1871 to question his conclusions, unless abundant facts could be shown to confirm the assertions of the critic. The author's life among the Indians was spent chiefly with a single division of the Dakota, known as the Santee or Mdewakantonwan. A few of the Teton words in his dictionary were furnished by one of his sons, Rev. T. L. Riggs, but most of them were obtained from Rev. W. J. Cleve\u00ad land. The author, moreover, knew very little about the languages of those cognate tribes that are not Dakota, such as the Ponka, Omaha, Kansa, Winnebago, etc., while I have lived among many of these tribes and have devoted considerable time to the comparison of most of the Siouan languages, having engaged in original investigation from time to time, as late as February, 1893, when I visited the Biloxi Indians in Louisiana. In order, therefore, to furnish the readers of this volume with the \"latest information, and to give more fully than was possible in those footnotes for which I am responsible my reasons for hesitating to accept some of the author's conclusions, as well as evidence confirmatory of some of the author's statements this preface has been written. In my notation of Dakota words, both in this preface and in the foot\u00ad notes, the author's alphabet has been used, except where additional charac\u00ad ters were needed; and such characters are described in the following section of this preface. But in recording the corresponding words in the cognate languages the alphabet used is that of the Bureau of Ethnology. All footnotes followed by \" S. R. R.\" were contributed by the author. Those furnished by his son, Rev. Alfred L. Riggs, are signed \"A. L. R.\" \"T. L. R.\" stands for Rev. T. L. Riggs, and \" J. P. W.\" for Rev. J. P. Williatnson. \" J. 0. D.\" marks those footnotes for which I am responsible. LIST OF SOUNDS PECULIAR TO INDIAN WORDS IN THE PREFACE. The alphabet given by the author on pages 3 and 4 has no characters representing certain sounds heard in the Teton dialect of the Dakota and in some of the cognate languages. Besides these, there are other sounds, unknown in Teton and the other dialects of the Dakota, but common to the other languages of the Siouan family. These peculiar sounds and some additional ones which are described are given in the characters adopted by the Bureau of Ethnology. The authority for the Hidatsa words is Dr. Washington Matthews, U. S. Army.1 The Tutelo words were Indians.PREFACE. XIII chiefly by Dr. Horatio Hale, though a few were acquired since 1882 by Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt and myself.

On page 11 it is said that the separate personal pronouns \" appear to be capable of analysis, thus: To the incorporated forms mi, ni, and i, is added the substantive verb, e, the y coming in for euphony. So that miye is equivalent to I am, niye to thou art, and iye to he is\" On page 12 the author informs us that \" mis, nis, and is would seem to have been formed from miye, niye, iye; as, miye es contracted into mis; niye es contracted into iris, etc.\" On the same page we find the emphatic forms of the pronouns, mis miye, I myself; nis niye, thou thyself; is iye, he himself, etc. Now, if the author has made correct analyses, miye mi-f-y+e; niye mi-f-y-f-e. He tells us, too, that the forms mis, nis, and is were originally subjective, while miye, niye, and iye were originally objective. On examining a myth in the Bushotter (Teton) collection, the following sentences were extracted, as they show how the Teton Indians use the separ\u00ad able pronouns. When the Giant Anung-ite or Two Faces discovers the pres\u00ad ence of his adversary, Ha^ela, he exclaims, Nis eya kakisciya yacirj na elYou too I make you suffer you wish and to mayau he: Are you coming to me because you wish me to make youme yon are ? coming suffer, too? (Here nis is INo, you indeed head the with a whizzing cutting it I make yours will when to I come (and no one . sound off go suddenly to you else) come to you in order to\" cut off your head (making) a whizzing sound (with my sword) as I send it (your head) surldenly (or forcibly) to the ground. Here niyes, which is objective in this sentence, marks a contrast: it is you only, not I, who must suffer. After killing the giant, Ha^ela takes the rescued infant to the lodge of his parents, who are afraid to lot him enter, as they think that he is the giant. So Ha5[ela says, Inn, heO mother, tli.it miye ca wahi ye lo: 0 mother, this is I who have come, not he (the1 as I have indeed come giant). Here miye is subjective. When Ha^ela is taken to the lodge of the chief who has two daughters, the elder daughter says to the younger, I to, miyes le bluha kte: Well, I (not you) will have this one (for myWell, I (not you) this I have will husband). But the younger sister laughs as she retorts, He yacir) sni caThat yon wanted not as miyes hingna wayin kte cins: As you did not want him (when youI (not you) a husband- I have him will .(female for speaking)PEEFACE. XV could have had him.) Subsequently, when the elder sister had turned Ha^ela into a dog, ins eya iha na heya, Nis ehan iiicakizir) kte, eya: She,she too laughed and said as You yourself , you suffer shall sai'd what follows precedes too, laughed and said, \" You yourself shall suffer (now).\" INSEPARABLE PRONOUNS. On page 13 the author remarks, \" These forms md and d may have been shortened from rniye and niye, the n of niye being exchanged for d.\" In addition to the objections given in the foot note on p. 13, the editor offers the following table: Siouan ue ma, mi 2d, modal prefixes da- and du- are not exact equivalents of the Dakota ya- and yu-, the (pegiha 0a- and $i-; etc. The following appears on page 15: \"Perhaps the origin of the 't' in 'tku' may be found in the t ta' of the 3d person used to denote property/' How can this apply to deksi-tku, his or her mother's brother, even if it could be said of tanksi-tku, his younger sister, and cinhin-tku, his or her son? While a son or a sister might be transferred to another person's keeping, a mother's brother could not be so transferred. Such an uncle had greater power over his sister's children than the father had, among the Omaha and cognate, tribes, and presumably among the Dakota. Among the Omaha even an adoptive uncle was conceded this power, as when Susette La Fleche (now Mrs. T. H. Tibbies) was invited by her father's brother (a Ponka chief) to remove from the Omaha Reservation in NebraskaXVI DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. to the Ponka Reservation in the Indian Territory, for the purpose of accepting a position as teacher in the agency school. The real father, Joseph La Fleche, consented, but Two Crows, an adoptive mother's brother, and no real kinsman, objected, and for that reason Susette did not go. It appears, then, that the tt1 in 'deksi-tku' does not imply \"transferable possession.\" CONTINUATIVES. On page 45 the author translates two proper names thus: Inyarjg-mani, One-who-walks-running, and Anawarjg-mani, One-who-walks-as-he-gallops- 011. As mani is used here as a continuative, it would be better to render the two names, One-who-continues-running, and One-who-continues-gal- loping-on. In all of the Siouan languages which have been studied by the editor we find these continuatives. They are generally the classifiers, words denoting attitude, the primary ones being those denoting standing, sitting-, or reclining'. In the course of time the reclining- is differentiated O' O O from the moving; but at first there is no such differentiation. The author agreed with the editor in thinking that some of these Dakota continuative signs, harj, warjka, and yanka, were originally used as classifiers; and a comparison of the Teton texts with those contained in the present volume shows that these words are still used to convey the idea of action that is (1) continuous or incomplete and (2) performed while the subject is in a certain attitude. Thus har) means to stand, stand upright or on end, but when used after another verb it means the standing object. The other verbs used as classifiers and continuatives are warjka (Teton, yurjka), to recline, yanka (Teton, yarj^a), to sit, hence to be. Yanka occurs as a classifier on pp. 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, etc. That it conveys the idea of sitting is shown by the context on p. 89, where the Star born sat (iyotarjke) on the ridge of the lodge and was fanning himself (ihdadu yanka). Waijka, to recline: on p. 83, the twin .flowers abounded (lay all along) in the star country. On the next page, the infant Star born was kicking out repeatedly (nagarjgata warjka, he lay there kicking). On page 110 we read, Urjktomi war) kaken ya warjka, An Unktomi was going (literally, going he reclined). CARDINAL BIRTH-NAMES. The Dakota names which belong to children, in the order of their birth, up to fifth child, are given on page 45. Thus the first child, if a boy, is called Caske; if a girl, Winona. The second, if a boy, is called Heparj,PEEFACE. XVII and if a girl, Hapan, and so on. While this class of birth-names is found among the Ponka, Omaha, Osage, Kansa, Kwapa, the j^oiwere tribes, and the Winnebago, all these tribes observe a different rule, i. e., the first son is always called Ing/3an, or some equivalent thereto, even though he may not be the first child, one or more daughters preceding him in the order of birth; and in like manner the first daughter is always called Winan or by some one of its equivalents, although she may have several brothers older than herself. On the other hand, if there should be in a Dakota household first a daughter, next a son, the elder or first born would be Winona and the next Haparj (there being no Caske), while if the first born was a boy and the next a girl the boy would be Caske and his sister Hapar) (there being no Winona). KINSHIP TEEMS. 1 The following are the principal kinship terms in most of the Siouan languages, all of which, except those in the Dakota, Hidatsa, Mandan, and Tutelo, having been recorded by me. Most of the terms may be used by females as well as males; but when the use of a term is restricted to persons of one sex a note to that effect will be found in the proper place. In the Biloxi column, the algebraic sign (\u00b1) denotes that the ending following it may be used or omitted at the will of the speaker. \" ' See pp. 45, 203, 204, 207, 7105 VOL is IIXVIII DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY.

The \"hna\" in the Dakota term should not be compared with the Dakota verb, ohnaka, to place in, but with the (fegiha verb, g^an, to take a wife (see \"g^an\" in eg^ange, a husband, her husband}, which answers to Kansa lange, the Osage J^B&^Q, and the j/mvere ^rafie, all of which are related to the verb, to take hold of, seize, apparently pointing to a time when marriage by capture was the rule. (See the Dakota verb yuza.) The original meaning of \"my husband\" therefore may have been my capturer or seizer. Ohnaka, when applicable to a person, refers to a sitting one, other\u00ad wise it is applicable to what is curvilinear, a part of a whole, a garment, book, etc. This is not brought out by the author, though attitude is expressed or implied in nearly all the verbs of placing or putting in the various Siouan languages. The Tutelo Avord for her husband, etamanki, does not mean, \" her man.\" Manki, a husband, differs materially from the several words which are said to mean \"man\" in Tutelo. \"To take a husband,\" in \"to take a wife\" is tamihunse (from etamihenen, a wife, his wife). \" To take a husband\" in Biloxi, is yifi5[adonni, very probably from yifi5[a^i and onni, probably meaning \"to make or have for a husband or child's father.\" \"To take a wife\" in Biloxi, and onni, to do, make), literally, \"to make young one.\" The Biloxi term for \"my wife,\" nyim[onniyan, may have been derived from yifbji, little one, child, and onni an occasional form of tinni or unniyan, a mother, the whole meaning, \"my little one his or her mother.\" In like manner, \"my husband,\" nyirb[a^iya n, may have been derived from yin^i, child, and a^iyan or adiyan, his or her father, the com\u00ad pound meaning, \"my little one his or her father.\" Among the Dakota names for kinship groups (see page 45), there are several which admit of being arranged in pairs, and such an arrangement furnishes hints as to the derivation of at least one name in each pair, in connection with present and probably obsolete forms of marriage laws. In each pair of names, the second invariably ends in ksi or si, the exact meaning of which has not been ascertained, though it may be found to imply a prohibition. Thus, cirjcu, his elder brother, cinye, an elder brother (of a male); but cirj-ksi, crsoii (who can not marry the widow of the speaker, though one whom that speaker calls cinye can marry her.) .A woman's elder sister is cun, cunwe, or cunwi, her elder sister being cunku or cunweku; but a daughter is cun-ksi (she can not marry her mother's husband, though the mother's elder sister can do so). A man's elder sister is tarjke, a woman's younger sister, tarjka; but a man's younger sister is tan-ksi; it is not certain whether there is any restriction as to marriagePREFACE. xxiit contained in this last kinship name. A father is ate, and a mother's brother is de-ksi (in Teton, le-ksi); we find in the cognate languages (excepting (pegiha and Winnebago) some connection between the two names, thus in Kwapa, the syllable te is common to ed^-ate and ete^e; in Kansa, dje is common to is common to i^se and iuj;se:5[i; in j^oiwere, tee is common to antce and itceka. At present, my mother's brother can not marry my father's widow (who is apt to be his own sister). A man's brother-in-law (including his sister's husband) is tahag, and a man's male cousin is tahai)-si (who can not marry that sister). A woman's brother-in-law or potential husband is sice, but her male cousin, who can never become her husband, is ice-si or sice-si. A man's sister-in- law (including his potential wife), is harjka; but a man's female cousin (whom he can not marry) is hai)ka-si. A woman's sister-in-law (including her husband's sister and her brother's wife) is iceparj, but a woman's female cousin (who can become neither the husband's sister nor the brother's wife) is i<5eparj-si. The editor proposes to group together in like manner the corresponding terms in the cognate languages, such as ijin{\u00a3e, his elder brother, and ijinge, his or her son; ijan^e, her elder sister, and ijaiige, his or her daughter; but that must be deferred to some future time. CARDINAL NUMERALS. On pages 48 and 49 the author undertakes to analyze the Dakota names for the cardinal numerals. He does this without comparing the Dakota names with those in the cognate languages. A knowledge of the latter will enable the student to correct some of the statements of the author, and for that reason these names are now given. ONE.

On p. 174 Dr. Riggs, in speaking of Hennepin's narrative, says: \"The principal chief at that time of this part of the tribe, is called by Hennepin ' Washechoonde.' If he is correct, their name for Frenchmen was in use, among the Dakota, before they had intercourse with them, and was probably a name learned from some Indians farther east.\" The author's supposition as to the eastern origin of wasicurj as an appellation for white men might stand if there were no explanation to be found in the Dakota and cognate languages. Hennepin himself is a witness to the fact that the Dakota Indians of his day called spirits wasicurj (as Dr. Riggs states on p. 175). And this agrees with what I have found in the Teton myths and stories of the Bushotter collection, where wasicurj is given as meaning guardian spirit. Dr. Riggs himself, in his Dakota-English dictionary, gives wasicurj as \" nearly synonymous with wakarj\" in the opinion of some persons. He appends the following Teton meanings: \"A familiar spirit; some mysterious forces or beings which are supposed to communicate with men; mitawasicurj he omakiyaka, my familiar spirit told me that.\" This phrase he gives as referring to the Takuskanskarj, the Something-that-moves or the Wind powers. The Mandan use waci and the Hidatsa maci for white man. Though the Hidatsa word was originally applied only to the French and Canadians, who are now sometimes designated as masikat'i (maci-kutc,i, in the Bureau alphabet),, the true whites. The j^oiwere tribes (Iowa, Oto, and Missouri) call a Frenchman ma9 okenyi, in which compound map is equivalent to maci of the Hidatsa, waci of the Mandan, and wasicurj of the Dakota. The Poiika and Omaha call a white man waqe, one who excels or goes beyond (the rest), and a Frenchman waqe uke^in, a common white man. The Winnebago name for Frenchman is waqopinina, which may be compared with the word for mysterious. NOTES OST THE DAKOTA MYTHS. On p. 84, lines 8 to 13, there is an account of the wonderful result produced by tossing the Star-born up through the smoke hole. In the Biloxi myth of the Hummingbird there is an account of a girl, a boy, and a dog that were cared for by the Ancient of Crows. One day, in the absence of the fostermother, the girl tossed four grains of corn up through the smoke hole, and when they came down they became many stalks filled with ears of excellent corn. The girl next threw the tent itself up into the air, causing it to come dowr a beautiful lodge. When she threw her littlePEEFACE. XXXI brother into the air he came down a very handsome warrior. The girl then . asked her brother to toss her up, and when he had done this, she came down a. very beautiful woman, the fame of her loveliness soon spreading throughout, the country. The dog and such clothing as the sister and brother possessed were tossed up in succession, each act producing a change for the better. On p. 85, from line 33 to p. 86, line 5, there is an account of the deliverance of the imprisoned people by the Star-born when he cut off the heart of the monster that had devoured them. In like manner the Rabbit delivered the people from the Devouring Mountain, as related in the (jtegiha -myths, \"How the Rabbit went to the Sun,\" and \"How the Rabbit killed the Devouring Hill,\" in \" Contributions to North American Ethnology,\" Vol. vi, pp. 31, 34. Note 2, p. 89. Eya after a proper name should be rendered by the initial and final quotation marks in the proper places, when eciya follows, thus: Mato eya eciyapi, They called him, \" Grizzly bear.\" When heya precedes and eya follows a phrase or sentence the former may be rendered, he said as folloivs, and the latter, he said what precedes. Heya answers to ge, gai or ga-biama of the (pegiha, and eya to e, ai or a-biama. In like manner the Dakota verbs of thinking may be rendered as follows: hecirj (which precedes, answering to ge$egau.of the ^egiha), by lie thought as follows, and ecirj (which follows, answering to e^egan in (^egiha), by lie thought what precedes. The myth of the Younger Brother (p. 139-143) contains several incidents which find their counterparts in the Biloxi myth of the Thunder- being. In the Dakota myth the wife of the elder brother plots against the younger brother; she scratches her thighs with the claws of the prairie chicken which the brother-in-law had shot at her request, and tells her husband on his return that his brother had assaulted her. In the Biloxi myth it is the aunt, the wife of the Thunder-being's mother's brother, who scratched herself in many places. In the Dakota myth the Two Women are bad at first, while the mother was good. But in the Biloxi myth the Old Woman was always bad, while her two daughters, who became the wives of the Thunder-being, were ever beneficient. In the Dakota myth the old woman called her husband the Urjktelii to her assistance, prevailing on him to transport her household, including the Younger Brother, across the stream. In the Biloxi myth the two wives of the Thunder-being, after the death of their mother, call to a huge alligator, of the \"salt water species called box alligator\" by the Biloxi, and he comesXXXII DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. to shore in order to serve as the canoe of the party. Doubtless there were more points of resemblance in the two myths, but parts of the Biloxi one have been forgotten by the aged narrator. NOTES ON THE DAKOTA DANCES. 1 The Begging dance is known among the Ponka as the Wana watcigaxe (See \"Omaha Sociology,\" in 3d Ann. Kept. Bur. Ethn., p. 355.) The No flight dance is the Make-no-flight dance or Mafia watcigaxe of the Ponka and Omaha. It is described in \" Omaha Sociology\" (in 3d Ann. Rept. Bur. Ethn., p. 352). The Scalp dance is a dance for the women among the Ponka and Omaha, who call it Wewatci. (See \" Omaha Sociology,\" in 3d Ami. Rept. Bur. Ethn., p. 330). The Mystery dance is identical with the Wacicka of the Omaha. A brief account of. that dance was published by the editor in \" Omaha Sociology,\" in 3d Ann. Rept. Bur. Ethn., pp. 342-346. The Grass dance, sometimes called Omaha dance, is the dance of the He^ucka society of the Omaha tribe, answering to the Ilucka of the Kansa, and the In^^uBcka of the Osage. For accounts of the He^ucka see Sociology,\" \"Hae- thu-ska society of the Omaha tribe,\" by Miss Alice C. Fletcher, in the Jour, of Amer. Folk-Lore, April-June, 1892, pp. 135-144.

As there are only comparatively very few cases where a full n is used at the end of a syllable, 110 distinctive mark has been found necessary.

Some Dakotas, in some instances, introduce a slight 6 sound before the \u00bb\u00bb, and also a d sound before n. For example, the preposition \"om,\" icifh, is by some persons pronounced obm, and the preposition \"en,\" in, is sometimes spo'ken as if it should be written edn. In these cases, the members of the Episcopal mission among the Dakotas write the 6 aud the d, as \"ob,\" \"ed.\" * These are called cerebrals by Lepsius. In the alphabet of the Bureau of Ethnology these sounds are designated by tc' (=6, of Kiggs), k' (=k), explosives.SYLLABICATION ACCENTS. 5 SYLLABICATION. \u00a7 3. Syllables in the Dakota language terminate in a pure or nasalized vowel, as ti-pi, house, tarj-yarj, well. To this rule there are some excep\u00ad tions, viz.: a. The preposition ' en/ in, and such words as take it for a suffix, as, petan, on the fire, tukten, where, etc.; together with some adverbs of time, as, dehan, now, hehan, then, tohan, when, etc. &. When a syllable is contracted into a single consonant (see \u00a7 11), that consonant is attached to the preceding vowel; as, om, with, from o-pa, to follow; bo-sim-si-pa, to shoot off, instead of bo-si-pa-si-pa. But, in cases of contrac\u00ad tion in reduplication, when the contracted syllable coalesces readily with the consonant that follows, it is so attached; as, si-ksi-ca; sa-psa-pa. c. There are some other syllables which end in s; as, is, hv, iiis, thou, mis, I, nakaes, indeed, etc. These are probably forms of contraction. ACCENTS. PLACE OF ACCENT. \u00a7 4. 1. In the Dakota language all the syllables are enunciated plainly and fully; but every word that is not a monosyllable has in it one or more accented syllables, which, as a general thing, are easily distinguished from such as are not accented. The importance of observing the accent is seen in the fact that the meaning of a word often depends upon it; as, maga, a field, maga, a goose; 6kiya, to aid, okiya, to speak to. 2. More than two-thirds, perhaps three-fourths, of all Dakota words of two or more syllables have their principal accent on the second syllable from the beginning, as will be seen by a reference to the Dictionary; the greater part of the remaining words have it on the first. 3. (a) In polysyllabic words there is usually a secondary accent, which falls on the second syllable after the primary one; as, hew6skaiituya, in a desert place; iciy<5peya, to barter. (6) But if the word be compounded of two nouns, or a noun and a verb, each will retain its own accent, whether they fall two degrees apart or not; as, aguyapi-icapan, (wheat-beater) a flail; stand guard. KEMOVAL OF ACCENT. \u00a7 5. 1. Suffixes do not appear to have any effect upon the accent; but a syllable prefixed or inserted before the accented syllable draws the accent6 DAKOTA GEAMMAE, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGEAPHY. back, so that it still retains the same position with respect to the beginning of the word; as, nape, hand, minape, my hand; baksa, to cut off with off; mdaska, flat, carjmdaska, boards; maga, afield, mitamaga, my field. When the accent is on the first syllable of the word the prefixing- syllable does not always remove it; as, noge, the ear, manoge, my ear. \"2. The same is true of any number of as, kaska, to bind; wakaska, I wicawakaska, I bind them. 3. (a) If the verb be accented on the second syllable, and pronouns be inserted after it, they do not affect the primary accent; as, waste'daka, to love; wasteVadaka, I love something. (6) But if the verb be accented on the first syllable, the introduction of a pronoun removes the accent to the second syllable; as, mani, to walk; mawani, I walk. In .some cases, however, the accent is not removed; as, old, to reach to; 6wahi, I reach. 4. When 'wa' is prefixed to a Avord commencing with a vowel, and an elision takes place, the accent is thrown on the first syllable; as, iyuskirj, to rejoice prefixed to adjectives and verbs forming of them abstract nouns, the accent is placed on the first destroying. 6. So also when the first syllable of a word is dropped or merged into a pronominal prefix, the accent is removed to the first syllable; as, kiksuya, to remember; miksuya, remember me. CHANGES OF SUBSTITUTION AND ELISION. \u00a7 6. 1. 'A' or 'arj' final in verbs, adjectives, and some adverbs, is changed to 'e,' when followed by auxiliary verbs, or by certain conjunc tions or adverbs. Thus (a) When an uncontracted verb in the singular number ending with 'a' or 'arj.' precedes another verb, as the infinitive mood or participle, the 'a' or 'arj' becomes 'e;' as, ya, to to but they also say niwarj waug, I am sivimming.CHANGES OF LETTERS. 7 (&) 'A' or ' ag' final in verbs, when they take the sign of the future tense or the negative adverb immediately after, and when followed by some conjunctions, is changed into 'e;' as, yuke kta, there will be some; mde kte sni, I will not go. To this there are a number of exceptions. Ba, to blame, and da, to ask or leg, are not changed. Some of the Mdewakantonwai) say ta kta, he will die. Other dialects use tiij kta. Ohnaka, to place any thing in, is not changed; as, \"minapekhj takudan ohnaka sni \\vaiuj,\" I have nothing in my hand. Ipuza, to be thirsty, remains the same; as, ipuza say ipuze kta, but it is not common. Yuha, to lift, carry, in distinction from yuha, to have, possess, is not changed; as, mduha sni, I cannot lift it. (c) Verbs and adjectives singular ending in 'a' or (ag,' when the con\u00ad nexion of the members of the sentence is close, always change it into 'e;' as, ksape ca waste, wise and good; wagmdake ca wakute, I saw and I shot it. (cC) 'A' and 'an' final become 'e' will be good; takuna yute sni, he eats nothing at all. Some adverbs follow this rule; as, tag ye hin, very well; which is sometimes contracted into tanyeh. But *a' or 'an' final is always retained before tuka, unkai), unkans\", esta, sta, ke\u00a3, and perhaps some others. (e) In the Titogwag or Teton dialect, when 'a' or 'an' final would be changed into 'e' in Isanyati or Saiitee, it becomes 'irj;' that is when fol\u00ad lowed by the sign of the future; as, 'yukirj kta' instead of 'cagtekiyig kta,' etc. takes place before some conjunctions, as, epirj iia wagli, / said and I returned. 2. (a) Substantives ending in 'a' sometimes change it to 'e' when a possessive (ft) So, on the other hand, 'e' final is changed to 'a,' in forming some proper names; as, Ptagsigta, the name given to the south end of Lake Traverse, from ptag and sigte. \u00a7 1. 1. (a) When 'k' and 'k,' as in kig and kighag, ka and kehag, etc., are preceded by a verb or adjective whose final 'a' or 'ag' is changed for the sake of euphony into 'e,' the 'k' or 'k' following becomes 'c' or '<?;' yuhe if he has, instead of yuha kighag; yuke cehag, when there was, instead of yukag kehag. (&) But if the proper ending of'the preceding word is 'e,' no such change takes place; as, waste kighag, if he is good; Wakagtagka ape ka wastedaka wo, hope in God and love him.8 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AKD ETHtfOGRAPJBtY. 2. When 'ya,' the pronoun of the second person singular and nomina\u00ad tive case, precedes the inseparable prepositions 'ki,' to, and 'kiei,' for, the 'ki' and 'ya' are changed, or rather combined, into 'ye;' makest to, instead makest for one, instead of yakicicaga. In like manner the pronoun 'wa,' I, when coming in conjunc\u00ad tion with Wowapi wecage kta, / will make him a book, i. e. I ivill write him a letter. . 3. (a) When a pronoun or preposition ending in 'e' or 'i' is prefixed to a verb whose initial letter is 'k,' this letter is changed to 'c;' as, kaga, to make, kicaga, to make to or for one; kaksa, to cut off, kidicaksa, to cut off for one. (&) But if a consonant immediately follows the 'k,' it is not changed; as, kte, to kill, nikte, he kills thee. In accordance with the above rule, they say cicute, / shoot thee; they do not however say kidute, but kikute, he shoots for one. (c) This change does not take place in adjectives. They say kata, hot, nikata, thou art hot; followed by 'p' are interchangeable; Ihanktoijwai) dialect, often used for 'h' of the Wahpe- tonwarj; as,'kdi, to arrive at home, for hdi; canpakmikma, a cart or wagon, for canpahmihma. In the same circumstances the Titonwaij use ;g,' and the Mdewakaijtorjwar) '11;' as, caripagmignia, carjpanminma. 3. Vowel changes required by the Titoqwar): (a) 'a' to 'u,' sometimes, as 4wanga' to (h) 'a' or 'an' final, changed to 'e,' before the sign of the future, etc., becomes 'irj,' by the Titonwarj: (a) 'b' to 'w,' (1) in the prefixes 'ba- and 'bo,' always; (2) in some words, to is not in Titonwarj; (ft) 'h' to always in (/) to 'b/ as (1) in 'md' which becomes 'bl;' and (2) in 'm' final, contracted, as 'om' to 'ob/ Horn' to Hob;' 'm' in precative form 'miye' to 'piye;' (h) 'n' to 'b,' as (1) in contract forms of 'c,' 't/ and always; words, as 'nina'to 'lila/ 'miua' (III) to 'mila;' (3) 'n' final in words, as 'en' to hecen' to to (I) (n) becomes 'la/ as 'hoksidai)' changed to 'hoksila;' bnt sometimes it 'tuwedan' to 'tuweni/ as indicated above, in 'a' to 'u/ in some words, becomes 'yui)/ to 'napcirjyurjka/ 'iwarjga' to 'iyuqga/ etc. \u00a7 9. 1. When two words come together so as to form one, the latter of which commences and the former ends with a vowel, that of the first word is sometimes dropped; as, carjtokpaiii, to desire or long for, of caijte, tlte heart, and okpani, to fail of; wakpicahda, by the side of a river, from wakpa and icahda; wicota, many persons, from wica and ota. Tak eya, what did he say? is sometimes used for taku eya. 2. In some cases also this elision takes place when the second word commences with a consonant; as, napkawh) and namkawiij, to beckon with the hand, of nape and kawirj. 3. Sometimes when two vowels come together, ' w' or 'y' is introduced between them for the sake of euphony; . as, owihanke, the end, from o and ihanke; niyate, thy father, from the pronoun ni, thy, and ate, father. \u00a7 10. The 'yu' of verbs commelicing with that syllable is not unfre- quently dropped when the pronoun of the first person plural is used; as,10 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, A1SD ETHNOGBAPHY. have; yuza, to hold, urjzapi, we hold. Yiiza also becomes oze, which may be oyuze contracted; as, Makatooze, the Blue Earth River, lit. ivhere the Uue earth is taken; oze sica, bad to catch. CONTRACTION. \u00a7 11. 1. Contractions take place in some nouns when combined with a following noun, and in some verbs when they occupy the position of the infinitive or participle. The contraction consists in dropping the vowel of the final syllable and changing the preceding consonant usually into its corresponding sonant, or vice versa, which then belongs to the syllable that precedes it; as yus from yuza, to hold; torn from topa, four. The follow\u00ad ing changes occur: z into s; as, yuza, to hold any thing; yus nazin, to into s; as kakiza, to suffer; kakis waurj, I am suffering. g into li;. as, inaga, a field, and magd, a goose, are contracted into mah. k into g; as, warjyaka, to see any thing, is contracted into wanyag. p into ra; as, topa, four, is contracted into torn; watopa, to paddle or row a boat, is contracted into watom. t into d; as, odota, the reduplicated form of ota, many, much. t into g; as, bozagzata, the reduplicated form of bozata, to make forked by punching. 6, t, and y, into n; as, wanica, none, becomes wanin; yuta, to eat any thing, becomes yun; kuya, below, becomes kun. 2. The article 'kin' is sometimes contracted into 'g;' as, oyate kirj, the people, contracted into oyateg. 3. Cante, the heart, is contracted into can; as, canwaste, glad (cante and waste, heart-good). 4. When a syllable ending in a nasal (n) has added to it (m' or 'n,' the contracted form of the syllable that succeeded, the nasal sound is lost in the 'm' or 'n,' and is consequently dropped; as, cannunpa, to smoke a pipe, can num. mani, lie smokes as he walks; kakinca, to scrape, kakin iyeya. Contracted words may generally be known by their termination.- When contraction has not taken place, the rule is that every syllable ends with either a pure or nasalized vowel. See \u00a7 3.CHAPTER II. MORPHOLOGY. PRONOUNS. \u00a7 12. Dakota pronouns may be classed as personal (simple and com\u00ad pound), interrogative, relative, and demonstrative pronouns, together with the definite and indefinite pronouns or articles. PERSONAL PRONOUNS. \u00a7 13. To personal pronouns belong person, number, and case. 1. There are three persons, the first, second, and third. 2. There are three numbers, the singular, dual, and plural. The dual is only of the first person; it includes the person speaking and the person spoken to, and has the form of the first person plural, but without the ter\u00ad mination 'pi.' 3. Pronouns have three cases, subjective, objective,- and possessive. \u00a7 14. The simple pronouns may be divided into separate and incorpo\u00ad rated; i. e. those which form separate words, and those which are prefixed to or inserted into verbs, adjectives, and nouns. The incorporated pronouns may properly be called article pronouns or pronominal particles. Separate. \u00a7 15. 1. (a) The separate pronouns in most common use, and probabl)r the original ones, are, Sing., raiye, I, niye, tliou, iye, lie. The plural of these forms is denoted by 'urjkiye' for the first person, 'niye' for the second, and 'iye' for the third, and adding 'pi' at the end either of the pronoun itself or of the last principal word in the phrase. Dual, urjkiye, (/ and thoi.i) we two. These pronouns appear to be capable of analysis, thus : To the incor\u00ad porated forms 'mi,' 'iii' and 'i,' is added verb 'e,' the 'y' coming in for euphony. So that 'miye' is equivalent to I am, 'niye' to tliou art, and 'i}^e' to lie is.1 'A knowledge of the cognate languages of the Siouan or Dakotan stock would have led the author to modify, if not reject, this statement, as well as several others in this volume, to which at\u00ad tention is called by similar foot-notes. 'Mi' and 'ni' can be possessive (\u00a7 21) and dative (\u00a7 19, 3), or, as the author terms it, objective (though the act is to another) ; but he did not show their use in the subjective or nominative, nor did he give 'ij as a pronoun in the 3d singular. Besides, how could he reconcilehis analysis of mis', nis, and is (\u00a7 15, 1, Z>) with that of miye, aiye, and iye? J. O. D. 1112 DAKOTA GEAMMAE, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGEAPHY. (b) Another set of separate pronouns, which are evidently contracted forms, are, Sing., mis, I, iris, tlwu, is, he. The Plural of these forms is desig\u00ad nated by employing 'urjkis' for the first person, 'iris' for the second, and 'is' for the third, and adding 'pi' at the end of the last principal word in the phrase. Dual, urjkis, (/ and tlwu) ive two. These contracted forms of mis, nis, and is would seem to have been formed from miye, niye, iye; as, miye es contracted into mis; niye es contracted into nis, etc. 2. These pronouns are used for the sake of emphasis, that is to say, they are employed as emphatic repetitions of the subjective or objective pronoun contained in the verb; as, mis wakaga, sets of pronouns are used as emphatic repetitions of the subject, but the repetition of the object is generally confined to the first set. It would seem in fact that the first set may originally have been objective, and the second subjective forms. 3. Mis miye, / myself; nis urjkis* urjkiyepi, ^ve ourselves, etc., are emphatic expressions which frequently occur, meaning that it concerns the person or persons alone, and not any one else. \u00a7 16. 1. The possessive separate pronouns are: Sing., ours, tawapi, their or theirs: as, wowapi mitawa, my book, he mitawa, that is mine. 2. The separate pronouns of the first set are also used as emphatic repetitions with these; as, miye mitawa, own. INCORPORATED OR ARTICLE PRONOUNS. 1 \u00a7 17. The incorporated pronouns are used to denote the subject or object of an action, or the possessor of a thing. Subjective. \u00a7 IS. 1. The subjective article pronouns, or those which denote the subject of the action, are: Sing., wa, /, ya, thou; Dual, The Plur. 'pi' to the end of the verb. 1 \"Article pronoun\" is adopted by the author from Powell's Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages, 2d ed., p. 47. But the article pronoun of Powell differs materially from that of Riggs. The classifier which marks the gender or attitude (standing, sitting, etc.) should not be confounded with the incorporated pronoun, which performs a different function (\u00a717). J. o. D.PRONOUNS. 13 2. (a) These pronouns are most frequently used with active verbs; as, wakaga, / make; yakaga, tliou makest; urjkagapi, we make. (b) They are also used with a few neuter and adjective verbs. The neuter verbs are such as, ti, to dwell, wati, I dwell; itorjsni, to tell a lie, iwatorjsni, / tell a lie. The adjective verbs with which 'wa' and 'ya' are used are very few; as, waorjsida, merciful, waorjsiwada, / am merciful; duzaharj, swift of foot; ksapa, wise, yaksapa, tliou art wise. (c) The neuter and adjective verbs which use the article pronouns 'wa' and 'ya' rather than, 'ma' and 'ni,' have in some sense an active meaning, as distinguished from suffering or passivity. 3. When the verb commences with a vowel, the 'uij' of the dual and plural, if prefixed, becomes 'urjk;' as, itorjsni, to tell a lie, urjkitorjsni, we two tell a lie; au, to bring, urjkaupi, we bring. 4. When the prepositions 'ki,' to, and 'kfci,'/0r, occur in verbs, instead 'yaki,' 'we' and 'ye' (\u00a7 7. 2.); as, to make to one, make kicicaga, to make for, yecicaga, tliou makest for, vecieagapi, you make for one. Kiksuya, to remember, also follows this rule; as, weksuya, / remember. 5. In verbs commencing with 'yu' and 'ya,' the first and second per\u00ad sons are formed by changing the ' y' into ' md' and ' d;' as, yuwaste, to make good, mduwaste, I make thou good, duwastepi, you mdawa, I read, dawa, tliou readest. In like manner we have iyotarjka, to imdotarjka, I sit down, idotaijka, tliou doivn. Titorjwarj are 'bl' and '!;' as, bluwaste, luwaste, etc. 7. These forms, 'md' and 'd,' may have been shortened from miye and niye, the 'n.' of niye being exchanged for 'd.' Hence in Titoqwarj we have, for the first and second persons of 'ya,' to go, mni kta, iii kta,1 8. The third person of verbs and verbal adjectives has no incorporated pronoun. Objective. \u00a7 19. 1. The objective pronouns, or those which properly denote the object of the action, are, Sing., ma, me, ni, tliee; Plur., urj-pi, us, and ni-pi, you. 11 am inclined to doubt this statement for two reasons: 1. Why should one conjugation be sin\u00ad gled out to the exclusion of others? If md (bd, bl) and d (1) have been shortened from miye and niye, how about wa and ya (\u00a7 18, 1), we and ye (\u00a7 18, 4), ma and ni (\u00a7 19,1-2, Z>)? 2. See footnote on $15,1, a. This could be shown by a table if there were space. See \u00a7 54. J. 0. D.14 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, A3sT) ETHNOGRAPHY. 2. (a) These pronouns are used witn active verbs to denote the object of the action; as, kaga, lie made, makaga, he made me, nicagapi, he made you or they made you. (?>) They are also used with neuter verbs and adjectives; as, yazan, to be sick, mayazarj, I am sick; waste, good, mawaste, I am good. The Eng\u00ad lish idiom requires that we should here render these pronouns by the sub\u00ad jective case, although it would seem that in the mind of the Dakotas the verb or adjective is used impersonally and governs the pronoun in the ob\u00ad jective. Or perhaps it would better accord with the genius of the language to say that, as these adjective and neuter-verb forms must be translated as passives, the pronouns 'ma' and 'ni' should not be regarded in all cases as objective, but, as in these examples and others like them, subjective as well. (c) They are also incorporated into nouns where in English the sub\u00ad stantive verb would be used as a copula; as, wicasta, man, wimacasta, I am a man. 3. In the same cases where 'we' and 'ye' subjective are used (see \u00a7 18, 4), the objective pronouns have the forms 'mi' and 'ni,' instead of 'maki' and 'nici;' as, kicaga, he makes to one, micaga, lie makes to me, nicaga, lie makes to thee, nicagapi, he makes to you. 4. There is 110 objective pronoun of the third person singular, but 'wica' (perhaps originally man) is used as an objective pronoun of the third person plural; as, wastedaka, to love any one, wastewicadaka, he loves them; wicayazarj, they are sick. When followed by a vowel, the 'a' final is dropped; as, ecawicuijkicoijpi, we do to them. \u00a7 20. Instead of 'wa,' I, and 'ni,' thee, coming together in a word, the syllable 'ci' is used to express them both; as, wastedaka, to love, wasteci- daka, I love thee. The plural of the object is denoted by adding the term 'pi;' as, wastecidakapi, I love you. The essential difference between 'ci' and the 'uij' of the dual and plural is that in the former the first person is in the nominative and the second in the objective case, while in the latter both persons are in the same case. (See \u00a7 24, 1.) The place of the nominative and objective pronouns in the verb, adjec\u00ad tive, or noun, into which they are incorporated, will be explained when treating of those parts of speech. Possessive. \u00a721. Two forms of possession appear to be recognized in Dakota, natural and artificial. (a) The possessive article pronouns of the first class are, Sing., mi orPBONOUNS. 15 ma, my, ni, thy; Dual, urj, (my and thy) our; Plur., un-pi, our, ni-pi, your. These express natural possession; that is, possession that can not be .alienated. (&) These pronouns are prefixed to nouns which signify the different parts of oneself, as also one's words and actions, but they are not used alone to express the idea of property in general; as, mitaijcarj, my uncantepi, our hearts. (c) In those parts of the body which exhibit no independent action, the pronoun of the first person takes the form 'ma;' as, mapa, my head; manoge, blood, etc. \u00a7 22. 1. The pronouns of the first and second persons prefixed to nouns .signifying relationship are, Sing., mi, my, ni, thy; Dual, uijki, (my and younger, brother; mjkicirjcapi, our children. 2. (a) Nouns signifying relationship take, as the pronouns of the third person, the suffix *ku,' with its plural 'kupi;' as, suijka, the younger brother of a man, surjkaku, his younger brother; tarjka, the younger sister of a woman, tarjkaku, her younger sister; hihna, husband, liihuaku, her husband; site, father, atkuku, his or her father. (b) But after the vowel 'i,' either pure or nasalized, the sunix is either 'tku' or 'cu;' as, deksi, uncle, deksitku, his or her uncle; taijksi, the younger sister of a man, tarjksitku, his younger sister; cirjksi, son, cirjhirjtku, his tawin, a wife, tawidu, his wife; cirjye, the elder brother of a man, cirjcu, his elder brother. Perhaps the origin of the 't' in <tku' may be found in the Ha' of the third per\u00ad son used to deuote property. See the next section. \u00a7 23. 1. The prefixed possessive pronouns or pronominal particles of the second class, which are used to express property in things mainly, pos\u00ad session that may be transferred, are, they say also mitahoksidar), my boy. These pronouns are also used with koda, a particular friend, as, mitakoda, my friend, nitakoda, thy friend, takodaku, his friend; and with kicuwa, comrade, as nitakicuwa, thy comrade; also they say, mitawii], my wife, tawicu, his wife. 2. (a) 'Mita,' 'nita,' and Ha,' when prefixed to nouns commencing with *o' or 'i,' drop the 'a;' as, owirjza, tinazipe, his bow.16 DAKOTA GRAMMAB, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. (6) When these possessive pronouns are prefixed to abstract nouns which commence with Svo,' both the 'a' of the pronoun and 'w' of the noun are dropped; as, wowaste, wisdom; wowaorjsida, mercy, towaonsida, his mercy. (c) But when the noun commences with 'a,' the 'a' of the pronoun is usually retained; as, akicita, a soldier, mitaakicita, my soldier. 3. 'Wica' and 'wici' are sometimes prefixed to nouns, making what may be regarded as a possessive of the third person plural; as, wicahurjku, their mother; wiciatkuku, their father. 4. 'Ki' a pronominal in ode; wastekidaka, to love one!s own, from wastedaka; iyekiya, to find one's own to recognize from iyeya, etc. In certain cases the 'ki' is simply *k' agglutinated; as, kpaksa, to bredk off one's own, from paksa; kpagarj, to part with one's own, from pagaq, etc. 5. Other possessive particles, which may be regarded as either pro\u00ad nominal or adverbial, and which are closely agglutinated, are, in Isanyati; in verbs and 'yu.'

The double pronoun ' ci,' combines the subjective I and the ob\u00ad jective you; as, Avastecidaka, I love you, from wastedaka. (See \u00a7 20.) 2. The form ' kici,' when a double 'pronoun, is reciprocal, and requires the verb to have the plural ending; as, wastekididapi, they love each other. But sometimes it is a preposition -with and to: mici hi, he came with me. The Titoijwai} say kici waki, I came ivith him. 3. The reflexive pronouns are used when the agent and patient are the same person; as, wastei^idaka, he loves himself, wasteni<?idaka, thou lovest thyself, wastemieidaka, I love myself. The forms of these pronouns are as follows: Sing. Dual. Plur. f) * * * *X* ' * 2* / / * * and Iharjktorjwarj dialects 'tuwa' is used for tuwe, both as relative and interrogative. 2. Tuwe and'taku are sometimes used independently in the manner of nouns: as, tuwe u, some one comes; taku yamni warjmdaka, I see three things. 3. They are also used with 'dan' suffixed and 'sni' following: as, tuwedai] taku, what? which is used with the plural signification, both with and without the termination DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS. \u00a727- 1.

'Dag' or 'na' is sometimes suffixed, with a restrictive signification; as, dena, these, denana, only these; hena, those, henana, only so many. 3. 'E' is used sometimes as a demonstrative and sometimes as an im\u00ad personal pronoun. Sometimes it stands alone, but more frequently it is in combination, as, 'ee,' 'dee,' 'hee,' this is it. Thus it indicates the place of the copula, and may be treated as the substantive verb. (See \u00a7 155.) ARTICLES. \u00a7 28. There are properly speaking only two articles, the definite and indefinite. Definite Article. \u00a7 29. 1. The definite article is kirj, the; as, wicasta kin, the man, maka kirj, the earth. 2. The definite article, when it occurs after the vowel 'e' which has taken the place of 'a' or 'an,' takes the form 'cin' (\u00a7 7. 1.); as, widasta side cirj, the bad man. 3. Uses of the definite article: (a) It is generally used where we would use the in English. (&) It is often followed by the demonstrative 'he' kirj he in which case both together are equivalent to that which. In the place of 'kin,' the Titonwarj generally use 'kirjharj.'1 (c) It is used with verbs, converting them into verbal nouns; as, ecorjpi kin, the doers, (d) It is often used with class nouns and abstract nouns; when in English, the would be omitted; as, woksape kirj, the ivisddm, i. e., wisdom. See this more at large under Syntax. 4. The form of kirj, indicating past time, is kon, which partakes of the nature of a demonstrative pronoun, and has been sometimes so considered; as, wicasta kon, that man, meaning some man spoken of before. 5. When 'a' or 'an' of the preceding word is changed into 'cikorj' (\u00a7 7. 1.); as, tuwe warjmdake cikon, that person whom I saw, or the person I saw. In Titonwai), koi) becomes coij, instead of cikoij. W. J. CLEVELAND. Indefinite Article. \u00a7 30. The indefinite article is ' \\varj,' a or an, a contraction of the nu\u00ad meral wanzi, one; as, wicasta warj, a man. The Dakota article 'wan' would seem to be as closely related to the numeral 'wanzi' or 'warjda,' as the 'While some of the Titorjwan may use \"Idnhan\" instead of \"3[in/' this can not be said\"of those' on the Cheyenne Eiver and Lower Brule reservations. They use 5[in in about two hundred and fifty- five texts of the Bushotter and Bruyier collection of the Bureau of Ethnology. J. o. D.VEEBS VEBBAL BOOTS. 19 English article 'an' to the numeral one. This article is used a little less frequently than the indefinite article in English. VERBS. ' \u00a7 31. The Verb is much the most important part oi' .speech in Dakota; as it appropriates, by agglutination and synthesis, many of the pronominal, prepositional, and adverbial or modal particles of the language. Verbal Roots. '\u00a7 32..The Dakota language contains many verbal roots, which are used as verbs only with certain causative prefixes, and which form partici\u00ad ples by means of certain additions. The following is a list of the more common verbal roots: baza, smooth ga, open out gaij, open out gapa, open out gata, spread guka, spread out hiijta, brush off kmuij, twist hna, fall off hnayan, deceive huhuza, shake fica, open out, expand fici, crumble, gap hdata, scratch fide6a, tear, smash Moka, make a hole liepa, exhaust fiica, arouse fipa, fall down ftpu, crumble notch separate ksa, bend ksiza, double up ktaij, bend mdaza, spread open nidaza, burst out mdu, fine, pulverize mil a, rip mni, spread out pota, out psaka, break in tico psur), spill psurj, pta, cut out, pare off over crack, split sba, ravel split skica, press skita, draw tight smirj, scrape off sna, ring sni, cold, gone out sota, clear off, whitishsaka, press down ska, tie skica, press siia, miss spa, break off spi, pick off spu, fall off suza, mash taka, Verbs formed by Modal Prefixes. \u00a7 33. The modal particles ba,' ' ' pa,' ' ya,' and ' yu' are prefixed to verbal roots, adjectives, and some neuter verbs, making of20 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. them active transitive verbs, and usually indicating the mode and instru\u00ad ment of the action. (a) The syllable 'ba' prefixed shows that the action is done by cutting or sawing, and that a knife or saw is the instrument. For this the Titonwarj use ' wa' for the prefix. (b) The prefix ' bo' signifies that the action is done by shooting with a gun or arrow,'by punching with a stick, or by any instrument thrown end\u00ad wise. It also expresses the action of rain and hail; and is used in reference to blowing with the mouth, as, bosiii, to blow out.1 (c) The prefix ' ka' denotes that the action is done by striking, as with an axe or club, or by shaving. It is also used to denote the effects of wind and of running water. (d) The prefix l na' generally signifies that the action is done with the foot or by pressure. It is also used to express the involuntary action of things, as the bursting of a gun, the warping of a board and cracking of timber, and the effects of freezing, boiling, etc. (e) The prefix 'pa' shows that the action is done by pushing or rubbing with the hand. (/) The prefix 'ya' signifies that the action is performed with the mouth. (g) The prefix 'yu' may be regarded as simply causative -or effective. It has an indefinite signification and is commonly used without any refer\u00ad ence to the manner in which the action is performed. Usually the signification of the verbal roots is the same with all the prefixes, as they only have respect to the manner and instrument of the action; as, baksa, to cut in two with a knife, as a stick; boksa, to shoot off; kaksa, to cut off with an axe ; naksa, to break off with the foot; paksa, to break off with the hand; yaksa,- to bite off; yuksa, to break off. But the verbal root \u00a3ka appears to undergo a change of meaning; as, kas\"ka, to tie, yuska, to untie. \u00a7 34. These prefixes are also used with neuter verbs, giving them an active signification; as, nazin, to stand, yunazirj, to raise up, cause to stand; <5eya, to cry, naceya, to make cry by kicking. \u00a7 35. 1. We also have verbs formed from, adjectives by the use of such of these prefixes as the meaning of the adjectives will admit of; as, waste, good, yuwaste, to to'make yasica, to speak evil of. 2. Verbs are also made by using nouns and adjectives in the predicate, in which case they are declined as verbs; as, Damakota, I am a Dakota ; mawaste, I am good. Tor the Titonwat) use, see '-wo' and <yu' in the Dictionary.COMPOUND VERBS CONJUGATION FOEM. 2 1 3. Sometimes other parts of speech may be used in the same way, i. e., prepositions; as, einatanhan, I am from. COMPOUND VERBS. \u00a7 36. There are several classes of verbs which are compounded of two verbs. 1. 'Kiya' and 'ya' or 'yarj,' when used with other verbs, impart to them a causative signification and are usually joined with them in the same word; as nazin, he stands, uazinkiya, he causes to stand. The first verb is sometimes contracted (see \u00a7 11); as, warjyaka, he sees, warjyagkiya, he causes to see. . . , 2. In the above instances the first verb has the force of an infinitive or present participle. But sometimes the first as well as the second has the force of an independent finite verb; as, hdiwarjka, he comes home sleeps (of hdi and warjka); hinazirj, he comes stands (of hi and nazirj). These may be termed double verbs. \u00a7 37. To verbs in Dakota belong conjugation, form, person, number, mode, and tense. CONJUaATION. \u00a7 verbs are comprehended in three conjugations, distin\u00ad guished by the form of the pronouns in the first and second persons singu\u00ad lar which denote the agent. Conjugations I and II include all common and active verbs and III includes all neuter verbs. (a) In. the first conjugation the subjective singular pronouns are 'wa' or (we'and 'ya' verbs in 'yu,' 'ya,' and 'yo,' which form the first and second persons singular by changing the 'y' into 'md' and 'd,' except in the Titorjwarj dialect where these are *bl' and '!.' (c) Neuter and adjective verbs form the third conjugation, known by taking what are more properly the objective pronouns 'ma' and 'ni.' 1. Of neuter verbs proper we (a) the complete predicate, as, to die; asni, to get well; (6) waste with ay a or ic\"aga; was\"te amayan, I am growing better. 2. Of predicate nouns; as, Wamasidurj, I am a Frenchman. . .3. Of predicate adjectives; as, mawaste, I am good. AH adjectives may be so used.- A. L. Riggs.FORM. \u00a7 39. Dakota verbs exhibit certain varieties of form which indicate corresponding variations of meaning. 22 DAKOTA GEAMMAE, TEXTS, AND ETHHOGEAPHY. 1. Most Dakota verbs may assume a frequentative form, that is, a form which conveys the idea of frequency of action. It consists in doubling a syllable, generally the last; as, baksa, to cut off ivitli a knife, baksaksa, to cut off in several places. This form is conjugated in all respects just as the verb is before reduplication. 2. The so-called absolute form of active verbs is made by prefixing *wa' and is conjugated in the same manner as the primitive verb, except that it can not take an objective noun or pronoun. The 'wa' appears to be equivalent to the English something; as manor), to steal, wamanorj, to steal something; (cipple I-stole}, I stole an apple, wama- wanorj, I stole something, i. e., / committed a theft. 3. When the agent acts on his oivn,'\\. e. something belonging to him\u00ad self, the verb assumes the possessive form. This is made in two ways: First, by prefixing or inserting the possessive pronoun 'ki' (and in some 'k' alone); as, wastedaka, to love anything; chjca wastekidaka, child. in verbs in 'yu,' 'ya,' and lyo,' the possessive form is made by changing 'y' into 'hd;' as, yuha, to have or possess any thing; hduha, to have one's own; suktanka wahduha, I have my oivn horse. It has already been noted that in the Yanktoii dialect the 'y' becomes 'kd' and in the Teton dialect 'gl;' thus in the three dialects they stand, hduha, kduha, gluha. The verb 'hi,' to come to, forms the possessive in the same way: hdi, kdi, gli, to come to one's oivn home. Examples of 'k' alone agglutinated forming the possessive are found in kpatan, kpagan, kpaksa, etc. It should be also remarked that the 'k' is intercnangable with ft,' so that among some of the Dakotas we hear tpatan, etc. 4. When the agent acts\" on himself, the verb is put in the reflexive form. The reflexive is formed in two ways: First, by incorporating the reflexive pronouns, ici, ni<?i, mici, urjkici; prefix to as, yuzaza, to ^vash any thing; hduzaza, to wash one's own, as one's clothes; ihduzaza, to ivash oneself. 5. Another form of verbs is made by prefixing or inserting preposi\u00ad tions meaning to and for. This may be called the dative form. (a) When the action is done to another, the preposition *ki' is prefixed or inserted; as, kaga, make to one; wowapi kic&ga, (writing to-him-he-made), he wrote him a letter. This form is also-used when the action is done on something that belongs to another; as, suijka kikte, (dog to-him-he-killed^ he 'killed his dog.PEESON NUMBEE MODE.' 23 (6) When the thing is done for another, 'kfdi' is used; as, wowapi kidicaga, (writing for-him-he-made) he wrote a letter for Mm. In the plural, 'this sometimes has a reciprocal force; as, wowapi kici<5agapi, they wrote let\u00ad ters to each other. 6. In some verbs 'ki' prefixed conveys the idea that the action takes effect on the middle of the object; as, baksa, to cut in two with a knife, as a .stick; kibaksa, to cut in two in the middle. 1. There is a causative form made by 'kiya' and 'ya.' (See \u00a7. 36. 1.) 8. (a) The locative form should also be noted, made by inseparable \"locative form,\" made by the inseparable 'a' have several uses, among which are: 1. They sometimes express location on, as in arnani, to walk on. 2. Sometimes they convey the idea of what is in ad\u00ad dition to, as in akaga, to add to. PERSON. ' \u00a7 40. Dakota verbs have three persons, the first, second, and third. The third person is represented by the verb in its simple form, and the sec- end and first persons by the addition of the personal pronouns. NUMBER. \u00a7 41. Dakota verbs have three numbers, the singular, dual, and plural. 1. The dual number is only of the first person. It includes the person speaking and the one spoken to, and is in form the same as the first person plural, but without the termination 'pi;' as, wasteur)daka, -we two love him; maurjni, we two walk. 1 . 2. The plural formed by suffixing 'pi;''\"as, wasteundakapi, 'we love him; manipi, they walk. 3. There are some verbs of motion which form what may be called a collective plural, denoting that the action is performed by two or more acting together or in a body. This is made by prefixing ' a' or ' e;' as, u, to come, au, they come; ya, to go, ay a, they go;, nazin, to stand, enazin, they stand. These have also the ordinary plural; as, upi, yapi, nazirjpi. MODE. . \u00a7 42. There are three modes belonging toVDakota verbs.: the indicative, imperative, and infinitive. - .=.> 1. The indicative. is. the common form ,of the -verb; as, ceya/7ie(.cries; deyapi, they cry.24 DAKOTA GKRAMMEB, TEXTS, A3sTD ETHNOGRAPHY. 2. (a) The imperative singular is formed from the third person singular indicative and the syllables ' wo' and ' ye;' as, ceya wo, ceya ye, cry thou. Instead of the has we,' and Yankton and Titorjwarj men nse 'yo.' (fc) The sug\u00ad gested that ' po' is formed by an amalgamation of ' pi,' the common plural ending, and l wo,' the sign of the imperative singular. In like manner, 'pi' and ' ye,' may be combined to make ' pe.' The combination of ' miye' is not so apparent. 1 By some it is thought that the Titonwan women and children nse ' na' for the imperative. 2 The forms 'wo,' 'yo,' and 'po' are used only by men; and 'we,' 'ye,' 'pe,' and 'rniye' by women, though not exclusively. From observing this general rule, we formerly supposed that sex was indicated by them; but lately .we have been led to regard 'wo' and 'po' as used in commanding, and 'we,' 'ye,' 'pe,' and 'miye,' in entreating. Although it would be out of character for women to use the former, men may and often do use the latter. When 'po.' 'pe,' and 'miye' is used it takes the place of the plural ending 'pi;' as, ceya po, ceya miye, cry ye. But with the negative adverb ' sui,' the ' pi' is retained; as, ceyapi sni po, do not cry. Sometimes in giving a command the 'wo' and 'ye,' signs of the imperative, are not expressed, The plural endings are less frequently omitted. 3. The infinitive is commonly the same as the ground form of the verb, or third person singular indicative. When two verbs come together, the first one is usually to be. regarded as the infinitive mood or present parti- 1 Instead of 'po/ 'pe' and 'miye/ the Titonwarj make the imperative plural by the plural ending 'pi' and 'ye/ or 'yo;' as, ecotjpi yo. In the Lord's prayer, for example, we say, \" Waunhtanipi kirj uijkidicazuzupi ye;\" but we do not say and the precative form 'ye' may have been corrupted by the Santee into ' miye/ and by the Yankton and others into ' biye.' w. J. c. Then it would seem plain that 'po'is formed from 'pi' and 'yo;' and we reduce all the imperative forms, in the last analysis, to 'e' and 'o.' s. R. R. 2'Na' can hardly be called a sign of the imparative, as used by women and children. (1) It appears to be an abbreviation of wanna, now: as, maku-na, i. e., maku wanna, Give me, now! A cor\u00ad responding use of now is found in English. (2) It is, at best, an inter)ectional adverb. (3) It is not used uniformly with an imperative form of the verb, being often omitted. (4) It is used in other connections; (a) as a conjunction when used by women it may be only such, as, inakn na, Give it to me, and an incomplete sentence; it is often used between two imperative verbs, as, ikn na yuta, take and eat, whereas, if it was an imperative sign, it would follow the last verb; (6) it is used to sooth drying children, as, Na! or, Nana! (c) Na! andNaua! are also used for reproving or. scolding. (5) 'Na' is used possibly as the terminal cla,' and will drop off in the same way. (6) If'na' were a proper sign of the imperative, men would use it (or some corresponding form) as well as women. But.they do not. We niid 'wo' and 'we/ 'po' and 'pe;' like used by men. T. L.

What in other languages are called conditional and subjunctive modes may be formed by using the indicative with the conjunctions uijkans, kinhaq or cinhan,tuka, e\u00a3ta or Sta, and kes, which come after the verb; as, ceya urjkans\", if wakaSke kta tuka, if I had come, I would have bound him. TENSE. \u00a7 43. Dakota verbs have but two tense forms, the aorist, or indefinite, and the future. 1. The aorist includes the present and imperfect past. It has com\u00ad monly no particular sign. Whether the action is past or now being done must be determined by circumstances or by the adverbs used. 2. The sign of the future tense is 'kta' placed after the verb. It is often changed into 'kte;' for the reason of which, see \u00a7 6. 1. b. What answers to a perfect past is sometimes formed by using l kon' or ' cikon,' and sometimes by the article ' kin' or ' ciij;' as taku nawalion kon, what I heard. PARTICIPLES. \u00a7 44. 1. The addition of ' hay ' to the third person singular of some verbs makes an active participle; as, ia, to speak, walking. The verbs that admit of this formation do not appear to be numerous. 1 2. The third person singular of the verb when preceding another verb has often the force of an active participle; as, naliorj waurj, I am hearing. When capable of contraction it is in this case contracted; as, waijyaka, to see, warjyag nawazin, I stand seeing. \u00a7 45. 1. The verb in the plural impersonal form has in many instances the force of a passive participle; as, makaskapi wauij, (nie-they-bound I-ani) I am bound. 2. Passive participles are also formed from the verbal roots (\u00a7 33) by adding (harj' and ' waharj;' as, ksa, separate, ksaharj and ksawaharj, broken 1 Judging frorn analogy, hai) (see hai), to stand, to stand upright on end, in the Dictionary) must have been used long ago as a classifier of attitude, the standiny object. Even now we find such a use of tan in (Jegiha (Omaha and Ponka), kaq in Kansa, in Winnebago. The classifier in each of tliese languages is also used after many primary verbs, as harj is here, to express incomplete or continuous action. See \"The comparative phonology of four Siouan languages,\" in the Smithsonian Report for 1883. J. O. D.26 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. in t^vo, as a stick. In some cases only one of these forms is in use; but generally both occur, without, however, so far as we have perceived, any difference in the- meaning. A few of the verbal roots are used as adjectives; as, mdu, fine; but they also take the participle endings; as, mduwahaij crumbled fine. CONJUGATION I. \u00a7 46.

The objective pronoun occupies the same place in the verb as the subjective; as, kaska, lie binds, makaska, lie binds me; manor), he steals, maninorj, he steals thee. 2. When the same verb contains both a subjective and an objective pronoun, the objective is placed first; as, mayakaska, thou kindest me, mawicayanon, thou stealest them. An exception is formed by the pronoun of the first person plural, which is always placed before the pronoun of the second person, whether subjective or objective; as urjnicaskapi, we bind you.* KASKA, to tie or bind. Mm, her, it. Indicative. 15\u00a7 $i *Sing. 3. \u00a7 53. Active verbs are frequently used impersonally in the plural number and take the objective pronouns to indicate the person or persons acted upon, in which case they may be commonly translated by the Eng\u00ad lish passive.;, I am bound; wicakaskapi, (they bound them) they are bound. Verbs. - -\"\u00a7 54; Neuter and:adjective verbs seem likewise to be used impersonally and are varied by means of the same pronouns; as, -ta, dies- or he- dies or he is dead, nita, tliee-dead or thou art dead, mata, me-dead or I die or am dead, tapi, they die or are dead; possessive form, kita, dead to, as, ate makita,/a^er to waste, good, niwaste, thee-good, thou art good, inawaste, me-good, I am good, urjwastepi, we are good. It is suggested by Prof. A. W. Williamson that the so-called objective pronouns in these cases are used as datives and that they find analogy in our English forms methinks, meseems.1 A further careful consideration of these Dakota article pronouns and the manner in which they are used leads to the conclusion that these were the original forms, as fragments of ' miye' and ' mye.' In the progress of the language it was found convenient, and even necessary, for the active transitive verbs to have other forms, as, ( wa' and ' ya/ to be used solely as subjective rjronominal particles.2 Whence they were obtained is not manifest. But as children, in their first efforts to speak English, are found disposed invariably to use the objective for the subjective, as, me want, me cold, me sick, me good, etc., it would be natural that where the necessity of changing does not exist the original forms should be retained as subjectives. The form for the first person plural has been retained both as subjective and objective. Many of this class of verbs are best translated as passives. ' ':v It appears practically convenient to include these verbs and a few others which are varied in a similar manner in one group, to which we will give the name of third conjugation. 1 See foot-note on the Paradigm after \u00a7 59, 4. Prof. A. W. Williamson is correct Avitti reference to possessive or dative verbs in 'ki/ as kita, raakita. Compare the use liber.

On tfoe other hand, 'keya' comes in at the close of the phrase or sentence. It differs from ' eya' and i heya' in this, that, while their subject is in the same person with that of the verb or verbs in the same sentence, the subject of 'keya' is in a different person or the expression preceding is not in the same form, as regards person, as when originally used; as, mde kta, eya, I will go, he said; he said that I would go; that I will do, I said; hecamorj kta, kepa, 7 said that I would do that.

In some cases the first dative is not differentiated from the possessive. See note on $ 54. J. 0. D.40 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. NOUNS. FORMS OF NOUNS. \u00a7 60. Dakota nouns, like those of other languages, may be divided into two classes, primitive and derivative. \u00a7 61. Primitive nouns are those whose origin can not be deduced from any other word; as, maka, earth, peta, fire, pa, head, ista, eye, ate, father, ina, mother. \u00a7 62. Derivative nouns are those which are formed in various ways from other words, chiefly from Arerbs, adjectives, and other nouns. The principal classes of derivatives are as follows : 1. Nouns of the instrument are formed from active verbs by prefixing 'i;' as, yumdu, to wedge; kahirjta, to rake or siveep, icahirjte, a rake or broom. These again are frequently compounded with other nouns. (See \u00a7 68.) 2. Nouns of the person or agent are formed from active verbs by pre\u00ad fixing 'wa;' as, ihangya, to destroy, waiharjgye, a destroyer; yawaste, to Mess, Avayawaste, one who blesses, a b/esser. 3. Many abstract nouns are formed from verbs and adjectives by pre\u00ad fixing 'wo;' as, ihangya, mercy; waste, good, wowaste, goodness. 4. Some nouns are formed from verbs and adjectives by prefixing 'o;' as, warjka, to lie down, owaijka, a floor; apa, to strike, oape, a stroke ; owa, to marl: or write, oowa, a marl; or letter of the alphabet; sni, cold, as an adjective, osni, cold, a noun; maste, hot, omaste, heat. 5. a. 'Wica,'prefixed to neuter and intransitive verbs and adjectives sometimes forms of them abstract nouns; as, yaza,rj, to be sick, wicayazarj and wawicayazarj, sickness; waste, good, wicawaste, goodness. b. It sometimes forms nouns of the agent; as, yasica, to speak evil of, curse,. wicaA'asice, a curser. \\> * c. Some nouns, by prefixing 'wica' or its contraction 'wic,' have their signification limited to the human species; as, wicoliarj, human also father or one's father; wicahurjku, one's mother; wi<5acirjca, one's children. In like manner Ha' (not the possessive pronoun, but the generic name of ruminat\u00ad ing animals, and particularly applied to the moose) is prefixed to the names of various members of the body, and limits the signification to such animals; as, tacaijte, de the to such nouns is prefixed 'wa' (from wahaijksica, a bear), their signifi\u00ad cation is to the bear species; as, head; wall a, a wasun, a bear's den. In like manner, 'ho,' from hogan, a fish, prefixed to a few nouns, limits their sig\u00ad nification to that genus; as, hoape, fisli-fins ; hoaske, the bunch on the head of a fish. 6. Abstract nouns are formed from adjectives by prefixing ' wico,' which may be regarded as compounded of ' wica' and l wo;' as waste,good, wicowaste, goodness, waoijsida, merciful; wicowaoijsida, mercy. 1. a. Nouns are formed from verbs in the intransitive or absolute state by suffixing ' pi;' as, wowa, to paint OY write, wowapi, (they wrote some\u00ad thing) something written, a writing or book; wayawa, to count, wayawapi, figures or arithmetic. b. Any verb may be used with the plural ending as a verbal noun or gerund, sometimes without, but more commonly with, the definite article; as, icazo, to take credit, icazopi, ecorj, to do, ecorjpi kin, the doing of a thing. 8. When 's'a' is used after verbs, it denotes frequency of action, and gives them the force of nouns of the person; to nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs, and. has sometimes a diminutive and sometimes a restrictive signification. 1. Suffixed to nouns, 'darj' is generally lake, little lake; river, wakpadarj, little river or rivulet; apa, some, apadarj, a small part. 2. Some nouns now appear only with the diminutive ending, although they may formerly have been used without it; as, hoksidarj, boy; stirjhpa- da.rj, little dog, puppy; surjgidarj, fox. 3. Nouns ending with this diminutive take the plural termination be\u00ad fore the darj; as, hoksidai), boy, hoksipidarj, boys. 4. Some nouns ending in 'na,' when they take the plural form, change 'na' into 'darj;' as, wicirjyarjna, girl, wicirjyarjpidarj, girls; plur. wanistinpidarj. In some cases ' daij' is used only in the plural form; as, tonana, a few, plur. tonanarjpidarj. The Titon.wan, 'la/ in\u00ad stead of 'dan,,' for the diminutive ending ; as, hoksina and hoksila, for hoksidai).42 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. \u00a7 64. 1. 'Dag' is often joined to adjectives and verbs, as the last prin\u00ad cipal word in the clause, although it properly belongs to the noun; as, suktarjka warj waste-darj (horse a good-little), a good little horse, horse a little good; nicirjksi ceye-darj (tiny-son cries-little), tliy little son used with a transitive verb, ' darj' may belong either to the subject or the object of the verb; as, iiisuqka surjka kiktedarj (thy-brother dog his-killed-little), thy little brother killed his dog, or thy brother killed his little dog. Gender. \u00a7 65. 1. Gender is sometimes distinguished by different names for the masculine and feminine; as, wicasta, male elk, uparj, the female elk. 2. But more commonly the distinction is made by means of adjectives. 'Wi6a' and 'wirjyarj' denote the male and female of the human species; as, hoksiyokopa wica, a male child, hoksiyokopa wirjyarj, a female child. 'Mdoka' and Sviye' distinguish the sex of animals; as, tamdoka, a buck; tawiyedarj, a doe, the 'dan' being diminutive. These words, however, are often written separately ; as, pagorjta mdoka, a drake; zitkadarj wiye, a hen bird. In place; as, surjg mdoka, a horse; surjg wiye, a mare, from sunka. 3. Proper names of females of the human species frequently have 'wirj,' an abbreviation of 'wigyarj,' female, for their termination; as, Totidutawirj (Woman of her red house); Wakarjkazuzuwii) (Female spirit that pays debts). Sometimes the diminutive 'wirjiia' is used for 'win;' as, Mahpiwirjna (Cloud woman). Number. \u00a7 66. To nouns belong two numbers, the singular &nd.-plural. 1. The plural of animate objects is denoted by the termination 'pi,' which is attached either to the noun itself; as, surjka, a dog, surjkapi, dogs; or, as is more commonly the case, to the adjective or verb which follows it in the same phrase ; as, sugka ksapapi, wise dogs ; surjka econpi, dogs did it. 2. (a) Names of inanimate objects seldom take the plural termination, even when used with a plural meaning; as, car), a tree or trees; maga, a field or fields. (b) On the other hand, some nouns formed from verbs by adding the plural termination 'pi' (\u00a7 62. 7. a.) are used with a singular as well as a plural meaning; as, tipi, a house or houses; wowapi, a book or books.NOUNS: CASE, POSSESSION. 43 Case. \u00a767. Dakota nouns may be said to have two principal cases, the sub\u00ad jective and objective.1 The subjective and objective cases are usually known by the place which they occupy in the sentence. When two nouns are used, the one the subject and the other the object of the action, the subject is placed first, the object next, and the verb last; as, wicasta warj wowapi warj kaga (man made a look; Dawid Sopiya was\"tedaka (David wicaktepi (Dakota F.ox- Indian them-they-killed), the Dakotas killed the Fox Indians. When, from some consideration, it is manifest which must be the nominative, the arrangement may be different; as, wicasta Wakantaijka kaga (man God made), God made man. As this distinction of case is rather syntactical than etymological, see further in the Syntax. . \u00a7 68. The relation of two nouns to each other, ^possessor a,udpossessed, is sometimes indicated by placing them in juxtaposition, the name of the a, gosling, for \u00a7 69. But the relation is pointed out more definitely by adding to the last term a possessive pronoun, either separate or incorporated. 1. Sometimes the pronouns 'tawa' and 'tawapi' are used after the (a) But generally the possessive pronouns are prefixed to the name of <ta;' as, warjhiijkpe, with wo' drop the l w' and t;' God's goodness. (See \u00a7 23,2. b.) 1 A. L. Riggs thinks a better arrangement would include the genitive case with the subjective and objective. The rule of position would then be: A noun in the genitive case qualifying another noun is placed before the noun it qualifies. See \u00a7 68.44 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. (6) Nouns expressing relationship form their genitive by means of the suffix pronouns ' ku,' younger the brother; dirjksi, and Family Names.1 \u00a7 70. The proper names of the Dakotas are Avords, simple and com\u00ad pounded, which are in common use in the language. They are usually given to children by the father, grandfather, or some other influential rela\u00ad tive. When young men have distinguished themselves in battle, they fre\u00ad quently take to themselves new names, as the names of distinguished an\u00ad cestors of warriors now dead. The son of a chief, when he comes to the chieftainship, generally takes the name of his father or grandfather; so that the same names, as in other more powerful dynasties, are handed down along the royal lines. 1. (a) Dakota proper names sometimes consist of a single noun; as, Mahpiya, Cloud; Hoksidan, Soy; Wamdenida, Orphan; a single adjective; as, Sakpe, (Six) Lit\u00ad tle-six, the chief at Prairieville. 2. (a) But more frequently they are composed of a noun and adjec\u00ad nouns; as, Cloud-man; Pezihuta-wicasta, country; Ta-peta-tarjka, His-red-people. Sometimes they consist of verbs in the intransitive form, which may be rendered by nouns; as, Wakute, Shooter; Wanapeya, One-who- causes-flight. (b) Sometimes they verb; as, personal names of the Omaha. Ponka, Kansa, Osage, Iowa, Oto, and Missouri trihes will be found on pp. 393-399, Proc. A. A. personal names,\" pp. 263-268, Amer. July, 1890. J. O. D.ADJECTIVES. 45 (c) Sometimes the}7 are formed of two verbs; as, Irjyarjg-mani, One- who-walks-running. In some instance prefixed; as, Ana- war) g-rnani, One-who-walks-as-he-gallops-on. \u00a7 71. The names of the women are formed in the same way, but gen\u00ad erally have 'win' Cloud-woman. \u00a7 72. The Dakotas have no family or surnames. But the children of a family have particular names which belong to them, in the order of their birth, up to the fifth child. These names are, for boys, Caske\", Hepan, Hepi, Catan, Hapistirjna, Wanske, and Wihake. Thus the first child, if a boy, is called Caske, if a girl, Winona; the second, if a boy, is. called Heparj, and if a girl, Hapan, etc. If there are more than five children in the family, the others have no names of this kind. Several of these names are not used by the Titorjwarj and Ihanktonwan. \u00a7 73. The names of certain family relations, both male and female, are presented in the following table : elder brother elder sister younger brother younger sister male cousin female, cousin as, father, mother, uncle, aunt, grandfather, grand\u00ad mother, etc., are designated, both by men and women, by the same names. ADJECTIVES. \u00a7 74. 1. Most adjectives in Dakota may be considered as primitive; as, ska, white, taijka, large, waste, good. 2. A few are formed from verbs by prefixing 'wa;' as, onsida, to have mercy waonsida, merciful; carjtekiya, to love, wacaqtkiya, benevolent. \u00a7 75. Final ' a' or ' an ' of many adjectives is changed into ' e; when fol\u00ad lowed by certain particles, GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AM) ETHNOGRAPHY. NUMBER. \u00a7 76. Adjectives have three numbers, the singular, dual, and plural. \u00a777. The dual is formed from the singular by prefixing or inserting ' urj,' the pronoun of the first person plural; as, we tivo merciful ones. \u00a7 78. 1. The plural is formed by the addition of 'pi' to the singular; as, was\"te, good; wi6asta wastepi, good men. 2. Another form of. the plural which frequently occurs, especially in connection with animals and inanimate objects, is made by a reduplication of one of the syllables. (a) Sometimes the first syllable reduplicates; as, ksapa, wise, plur., ksaksapa; tarjka, great, plur. tarjktarjka. (6) In some cases the last syllable reduplicates; as, waste, good, plur., wasteste. (c) And sometimes a middle syllable is reduplicated; as, tarjkirjyarj, great or large, plur., taijkinkiijyarj. COMPARISON. \u00a7 79. Adjectives are not inflected to denote degrees of comparison, but are increased or diminished in signification by means of adverbs. 1. (a) What may be called the comparative degree is formed by sarjpa, more; as, waste, good, sarjpa waste, more good or better. When the name of the person or thing, with which the comparison is made, immediately pre\u00ad cedes, the preposition ' i' is employed to indicate the relation, and is pre\u00ad fixed to sarjpa; as, wicasta kirj de isarjpa waste, this man is better than that. Sometimes ' sam iyeya,'which may be translated more advanced, is used; as, sam iyeya waste, more advanced good or better. It is difficult to translate liyeya' in this connection, but it seems to convey the idea of passing on from one degree to another. (6) Often, too, comparison is made by saying that one is good and another is bad; as, de sica, he waste, this is bad, that is good, i. e. that is better than this. (c) To diminish the signification of adjectives, ' kitanna' is often used; as, tarjka, large, kitanna tanka, somewhat large, that is, not very large. 2. What may be called the superlative degree is formed by the use of 'nina,' ' hirjca,' and 'iyotarj;' as, nina waste, or waste hirj<5a, very good; iyotarj waste, best-NUMERAL ADJECTIVES CARDINALS. 47 NUMERAL ADJECTIVES. Cardinals. \u00a7 80. The cardinal numerals are a hundred, two hundred, a thousand, the great count, or a million. 1. The numbers from eleven to eighteen inclusive, are formed in two way s: (a) By ake, again; as, ake warjzidan, eleven; ake nonpa, twelve; ake yamni, thirteen, etc. Written in full, these would be wikcemna ake Avanzi- dan, ten again one; wikcemna ake nonpa, ten again two, etc. In counting, the Dakotas use their fingers, bending them down as they pass on, until they reach ten. They then turn down a little finger, to remind them that one ten is laid away, and commence again. When the second ten is counted, another finger goes down, and so on. (&) By sarjpa, more; as, wikdemna formed by urjma, the other; as, unma napcinwanka, the other nine. 3. (a) Wikdemna norjpa is (10 X 2) twenty, and so with thirty, forty, etc. The numbers between these are formed in the same way as between eleven and 'eighteen; as, wikcemna nonpa sanpa warjzidarj, or, X 5 + 9), fifty- nine. Over one hundred, numbers are still formed in the same way; as, opawinge + 6), two thousand five and thirty-six. 1 Also koktopawiqge.48 DAKOTA GKAMMAB, TE.ITS, AXD ETHNOGRAPHY. (ft) The numbers between twenty and thirty, thirty and forty, etc., are occasionally expressed by placing an ordinal before the cardinal, which de\u00ad notes that it is so many in such a ten; as, i yamni topa, four of the third (ten), i. e., twenty-four; itopa yamni, three of the fourth (t&n), i. e., thirty-three. It is an interesting study to analyze these numerals. It has been, stated above, that the Dakota, in common with all Indians, it is believed, are in the habit of using the hands in counting. It might be supposed then that the names indicating numbers would be drawn largely from the hand. The following derivations and explanations, it is believed, will be found ill the main reliable. 1. Warjca, etc. from warj! interjection calling attention perhaps, at the same time, holding -up a finger. 2. Norjpa, from en aorjpa, to bend doion on, or place on, as the second finger is laid down over the small oiie; or perhaps of nape orjpa, nape being used for finger as Avell as hand. The Ponka and Omaha is iiarjba, and the Winnabago nurjp.1 3. Yamni, from mni (root) signifying either turning over or laying up the 'ya' perhaps indicating- that it is done with the mouth. (See \u00a7 34/) It is suggested, as a further solution of yamni, that the 'mm' maybe an old root, meaning together ov flow together, as. we have it in the reduplicate amnirnni, e. g., mini amnimiii, to sprinlde water upon. The Ponka and Omaha is dha-bdhiij. 2 4. Topa, from opa, to follow; (perhaps ti, a house, and opa, follow -ivit}i) as we say, 'in the sain6 box,' with the rest. The three have banded together and made a 'ti' or 'tidarj,' as we would say a family, and the fourth joins them. The Ponka and Omaha is duba. 5. Zaptarj, from za, (root) holding (or perhaps whole, as in zani), and ptanyarj or ptaya, together. In this case the thumb is bent down over the fingers of the hand, and holds them together, 6. Sakpe, from sake, nail, and kpa o. kpe, (root) lasting as some kinds of food which go .a good ways, or filled, as a plump grain. This is the second thumb, and the reference may be to the other hand being complt \u00b0,d. Possibly from the idea of bending down as in nakpa, the ear. 1. Sakowirj, from sake, nail, and owirj, perhaps from owinga, to bend do'ivn ; but possibly from oin, to'wear, as jewelry, this being the fore finger of the second hand; that is, the ring finger. 1 Two takes the form ^\"ba (dhaij-ba) in the Omaha name Xaxe <(;auba, Two Crows and. de(pa\"ba, seven (+2?). Two in AVinnebago is expressed variously, even by the same speaker. Thus, we find noijp, nonpa, nonpi, and mn)p. J. 0. D. -</)a-b</i\" in the notation of the Bureau of Ethnology. J. O. D.DERIVATIONS OF NUMERAL ADJECTIVES. 49 8. Sahdogarj, from, sake, nail probably, and hdogarj, possessive of yugarj, to open; but perhaps it is ogarj or oge, to cover, to wear; the nail covers itself. Two fingers now cover the thumb.1 9. Napcinwanka, from nape, hand, cistirjiia, small, and warjka, lies hand-small-lies; that is, the remainder of the hand is very small, or perhaps, the hand now lies in a small compass. Eli Abraham explains 'napciijwaijka' as iromnapcupe. AM. fingers are napeupe, in the original sense; that is they are marrow bones of the hand. Now this finger of the second hand lies down alone. Two fingers have covered the thumb and this has to take a bed by itself. Rather the finger lies in the napcoka, inside of the hand. 10. Wikcemna, from wikce or ikce, common, and inn ay an, gathering, or from mna, to rip, that is let loose. It would then mean either that the com\u00ad mon or first gathering of the hands was completed, or that being completed, the whole are loosed, and the ten thrown up, as is their custom; the hands in the common position. 100. Opawinge, from pawir>ga, to bend down with the hand, the pre\u00ad fixed 'o' indicating perfectness or roundedness; that is, the process has been gone over as many times as there are fingers and thumbs. - 1000. Kektopawirjge or koktopawinge, from opawinge and ake or kokta, meaning again or also. This would indicate that the hundred had been counted over as many times as there are hand dig-its.2 \u00a7 81. Numeral adjectives by reduplicating a syllable express the idea of two and ttvo or by twos, three and three or by threes, etc.; as, nomnorjpa, by twos; yamnimni, Warjzikzi, the reduplicate of waijzi, properly means by ones, but is used to signify a few. (2) Norjpa and topa are often contracted into nom and torn, and are generally reduplicated in this form; as, same is true of opawirjge and kektopawinge; as, opawirjgege, by hundreds. (4) Napcinwaijka and twice, thrice, etc. Norjpa norjpa hecen topa, twice two so four, that is, twice two are four. The author gives, in the Dictionary, ogaij and oge, clothes, covering, a sheath; but not as a verb. T. O. D. 2 Can there be a satisfactory analysis of the Dakota numerals without a full comparison with those of the cognate languages of the Siouan family? I think not. J. 0. D. 7105 VOL IX 450 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. And 'akihde' is sometimes used for this purpose; as, norjpa akihde norjpa, two times tivo. \u00a7 83. 1. ' Darj' or ' na,' suffixed to numeral adjectives, is yamni, three, yamnina, only three; zaptan, five, five. is doubled; as, nom, tomnaua, part, hurjhnaiia, only a part. Ordinals. \u00a7 84. 1. The ordinal numbers, after tokaheya, first, are formed from cardinals by prefixing ' etc. \u00a7 85. When several numbers are used together, the last only has the ordinal 86. There are some adverbs, in very common use, whose derivation from other parts of. speech is not now apparent, and which may therefore be considered as primitives; as, eca, -when; kuya and kun, \u00a7 87. But adverbs in Dakota are, for the most part, derived from de\u00ad monstrative pronouns, adjectives, verbs, and other adverbs; and in some instances from other parts of speech. 1. Adverbs are formed from demonstrative pronouns, by adding 'han' and there,, then; ka, that, kalian, and kaharj, then, there, so far. The forms deharj and heharj are used with a slight difference of signification from dehan and hehan; the first indicating place and the latter time.2 (&) By adding 'ken.' and 'cen;' hecen, way. 1 A. L. Riggs suggests that eca has the force of when only by position, and that eca and ece, ca and 6e are frequentative particles, akin, in radical meaning, and perhaps in origin, to ' ake/ again. '2In the cognate languages, time words and space words are not fully differentiated. Thus in a, ata\" Jl, how lony? how far? when? J. O. (c) By 'ketu' and 'cetu;' as, kaketu, in that manner; decetu, in this way; hecetu, so, thus. (d) By adding 'en,' in, in a contracted form; as, de, this, den, here; he, that; hen, there; ka, that, kan, yonder; tukte, which f tukten, where f (e) By adding ' ki' and 'ci,.' 'kiya' and 'ciya;' as, ka, de, this, deci and deciya, here. 2. Adverbs are formed from adjectives, by adding ' ya;' as, waste, good, wasteya, formed from as, iyuskin, to rejoice, iyuskinyarj, rejoicingly, tanyan, well, may be from the obsolete verb 'tarj' (as they still use atan, to regard, take care o/); itorjsni, to tell a lie, itorjsniy an,/\u00ab\u00a3\u00a7<%. (b) Some are formed by adding ' ya' alone; as, aokaga, to tell a falsehood about one, aokaliya, falsely. (c) In a few instances adverbs are formed from verbs by adding ' na;' as, inahni, to be in haste, inahnina, hastily, temporarily. 4. Adverbs are formed from other adverbs. (a) By adding 'tu;' as, dehan, now, dehantu, time; at that time; tohan, when f tohantu, at what time f (b) Other forms are made by adding 'ya'to the ever way. (c) Others still are made by the further addition of 'ken;' as, clehan- tuyaken, toketuyakeii. The meaning appears to be substantially cthe same after the addition of ' ken' as before. (d) Adverbs are formed from other adverbs by adding ' yarj;' as, dehan, now, here, deharjyarj, to this time or place, so far; tohan, when f toharj- yan, as long as, liow long f ohinni, always, ohiijiiiyarj, for ever. (e) Adverbs are formed from other adverbs by adding ' tkiya;' as, kun, below, kuntkiya, downwards; warjkan, above, wai^kai]tkiya, upwards. 5. Some adverbs are formed from nouns. (a) By prefixing ' a' and taking the adverbial termination ' ya;' palm, hill, apahaya, hill-like, convexly; wanica, none, awanin and awaninya, (b) By suffixing 'ata' or 'yata,' etc.; as, he, a hill or ridge, lieyata, back at the hill. Words so formed may be called prepositional nouns. See \u00a7 91,52 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. 6. Adverbs are derived from prepositions. (\u00ab) By adding ctu' or 'tuya;' as, within, mahentu or mahetu and mahetuya, inwardly. By in, \u00a7 88. (a) What are named prepositions in other languages are in Dakota properly post-positions, as they follow the nouns which they govern. (See \u00a7 186.) (6) Prepositions may be divided into separate and incorporated. SEPARATE PREPOSITIONS. \u00a7 89. The separate prepositions in Dakota follow the nouns which they govern; as, car) akan naAvazirj (ivoocl upon I-staml), I stand wood; he maza or) kagapi (that iron of is-made), that is made of iron. The folloAving are the principal separate prepositions, viz: ahna, with etkiya, towards om, with them akan. on or upon etu, at oij, of or from, with, for ako, beyond kahda, l)y, near to opta, through ehna, amongst kici, with him, her, or it sanpa, beyond ekta, at, to inahen, within taijhaT),/r0?w en, in olina, in yata, at. oliomui, around Some of these are quite as often used as adverbs as prepositions. INCORPORATED PKEPOSITIONS, OR PREPOSITIONAL PARTICLES. \u00a7 90. These are suffixed to nouns, prefixed to or inserted into verbs, and prefixed to adverbs, etc. \u00a7 91. The prepositions to nouns are 'ta,' and at or on; prairie, at or the prairie; maga, a field, inagata, at the field; can, wood or woods, car) yata, at the woods. The preposition en, in, contracted, is suffixed to- a few nouns; as, ti, a house, tin, in the house. These formations may also be regarded as adverbs; as, he, a hill or ridge, lieyata, at the hill or back from. T. L. Riggs suggests that this class of words should be denominated prepo\u00ad sitional nouns or adverbial nouns. \u00a7 92. a,' ' e,' ' i,' ' o,' instead of being suffixed to the noun, are prefixed to the verb. 1. (a) The preposition 'a,' on or upon, is probably a contraction ofPKE POSITIONS CONJUNCTIONS. 53 ' akan,' and is prefixed to a very large number of verbs; as, mani, to walk, amani, to ivalk on, cankaga amawani, I ^valk on a log. (b) The preposition ''e,' to or at, is probably from ' ekta,' and is pre\u00ad fixed to some verbs; as, yulipa, to lay down anything- one is carrying, eyuhpa, to lay down at a place. ~ (c) The preposition ' i' prefixed to verbs means ivith, for, on account of; as, cekiya, to pray, icekiya, to pray for a thing. (oT) The preposition 'o,' in, is a contraction of 'ohna,' and is found in a large class of verbs; as, hnaka, to place or lay down, ohnaka, to place a thing in something else. 2. The prepositions which are either prefixed to or inserted into verbs, in the pronouns' place, are ' ki' and ' kici.' (a) ' Ki,' as a preposition incorporated in verbs, means to or for; as, kaga, to make, kicaga, to make to one; huwe ya, to go to bring anything, kihuwe ya, to go to bring a thing for one. (&) 'Kici' incorporated into verbs, means for; as, kaksa, to chop off, as a stick; kicicaksa, to chop off for one.. \u00a7 93. The preposition 'i' is prefixed to a class of adverbs giving them the force of prepositions. In these cases it expresses relation to or connexion with the preceding noun; as, teharj,/ftr, iteharj, far from any time or place; lieyata, behind, iheyata, back of something. These as: beyond ihukuya, under iakan, upon behind, back of itokam, before iaskadai), near to ikaijyeta, down from hyaijkaro, above icahda, by, near to ikiyedai), near to iyohakani, after ihakarn, behind isarjpa, beyond iyotabedaij, ihduksai), from without iyotakoijs, opposite to. CONJUNCTIONS. \u00a7 94. Conjunctions in Dakota, as in other languages, are used to con\u00ad nect words and sentences; as, waste ka and light was. \u00a7 95. The following is a list of the principal conjunctions, viz: urjkarj, ka and ca, kaes and keyas and \u00a796. It is very difficult to translate, or even to classify, Dakota inter\u00ad jections. Those in common use may be arranged under the following- heads, according to the emotions so! 'Eya,' when used at the beginning of a phrase or sentence, is an inter\u00ad jection, and seems to mean nothing. 1 \"Boast\" does not appear as can interjection in Webster's dictionary, nor in that of the Century Company. As ihdataij means lie praises himself, lie boasts, a better translation is, O hou> lie boasts! J. O. D.SYNTAX PEONOUNS. CHAPTER III. PERSONAL Incorporated Pronouns. \u00a797. The incorporated pronouns are either prefixed to or inserted into verbs, adjectives, and nouns. 1. POSITION IN VERBS. \u00a7 98. 1. (a) Monosyllabic verbs, such as, ba, to Name, da, to ask for, etc., necessarily prefix the pronouns; as mayaba (ine-tliou-blamesf), tliou blamest me. (b) Those verbs which are formed by adding- the prefixes ' ka' and ' pa,7 and also the possessive forms in ' kpa' or ' tpa/ ' hda,' and ' hdu,' have the pronouns prefixed ; as, kaksa, to cut off with an axe, wakaksa, I cut off; pagan, to part with anything, wapagarj, I part with; kpagarj, and tpagan, to part with one's own, wakpagarj, I part with my own; hduta, to eat one's own, wahduta, I eat my own. (c) Other verbs, whose initial letter is 'd' or 'k,' have the pronouns prefixed; as, daka, to esteem so, wadaka, I esteem so ; kaga, to make, yakaga, tliou makest. (d) For the forms of the subjective pronouns of the first person singu\u00ad lar and the second person singular and plural of verbs in ' ya' and ' yu,' see \u00a7\u00a739. (6), 50. 2. (a) All verbs commencing with a vowel which is not a prefix, insert the pronouns immediately after the vowel; as, opa, to follow, owapa, I fol\u00ad low ; excepting the first person plural, 'urjk,' which is prefixed; as, mjko- papi, we follow. But ourjpapi is also used. (b) The prefixing of the prepositions ' a,' ' e/ ' i/ ' o,' does not alter the place of the pronouns; as, kastarj, to pour out, wakastarj, I pour out; okastarj, to pour out in, o wakastarj, I pour out in ; palita, to bind, pawahta, I bind; apahta, to bind on, apawalita, / bind on. 5556 J)AKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. (c) Verbs formed from verbal roots and adjectives by prefixing 'ba,' 'bo,' and 'na,' take the pronouns after the prefix; as, baksa, to cut off with a knife, bawaksa, / cut off ; boksa, to shoot off, as a limb, boyaksa, thou sliootest off; naksa, to break off with the foot, nawaksa, / break off ^vith the foot. (cl) Other verbs whose initial letter is ' c,' ' s,' 'm,' or 'n,'have the pronouns inserted after stab, / stab; mani, to ^valk, mawani, 1 walk. Pahta, to bind or tie, also inserts the pro\u00ad nouns after the first syllable. (e) Verbs that insert or prefix the prepositions ' ki' and ' kici,' take the pronouns immediately before the prepositions. (See \u00a7 40. 5. a. ft.) (/) Active verbs formed from other verbs, adjectives, or nouns, by adding the causative 'kiya' or ' ya,' take the pronouns immediately before the causative; as, wanyagkiya, to cause to see, warjyagmakiya, he causes to see; samkiya, blacken; wakiya, I love any one. . (#) The compound personal and reflexive pronouns (\u00a7 24) occupy the same place in verbs as do the ordinary incorporated pronouns; as, waste- daka, to love, wastewadaka, / love anything, wastemicidaka, / love myself. 2. POSITION ]> ADJECTIVES. \u00a799. 1. (a) The pronouns are prefixed to what may be called adjective verbs and adjectives; as, yazarj, to be sick; tancai} sick; (thee-good^) thou art good. (b) The ' ma,' ' ni,' and l un' are prefixed the simple numerals; mawanzidarj, I am one; ninoqpapi, you are two; urjyamnipi, ive are three. 2. (a) But if the adjective verb has assumed the absolute form by pre\u00ad fixing ' wa,' or if it commences with a vowel, the pronouns are inserted; as, wayazarjka, to be sick, wamayazanka, / am sick;, asiii, to get well, amasni, / have recovered. (b) Waorjsida and wacantkiya, and perhaps some others, which we are accustomed to call adjectives, insert the pronouns; as, waoqsiwada, I am merciful. 3. POSITION IN NOUNS. \u00a7 100. 1. (a) The possessive pronouns are always prefixed to the noun. (See \u00a7\u00a7 21, 22, and 23.) (6) When a noun and pronoun are joined together, with the substan\u00ad tive verb understood, the incorporated pronoun, is prefixed to some nounsSYNTAX PRONOUNS. 57 and inserted (me-J)akota) I am a Dakota. In some iiouns the pronoun may be placed either after the first or second sylla\u00ad ble, according to the taste of the speaker; as, wicahhjca, an old man, wimaca.liinca or wieamahinca, I am an old man. (c) When a noun is used with an adjective or adjective verb, and a pronoun is required, it may be prefixed either to the noun or to the adjec\u00ad hard} my hand is hard. 2. In nouns compounded of a noun and adjective, the place of the pro\u00ad noun is between them; as, Isarjtanka, (knife-big} an American, Isarjmatarjka, / am an American. 4. POSITION WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER. \u00a7 101. 1. When one personal pronoun is the subject and another the object of the same A7erb, the first person, whether nominative or objective, is placed before the second; as, you have me; urjniyuhapi (we-thee-have or ^ve have thee or we have you. 2. Wica, the objective plural of the third person, when used in a verb with other pronouns, is placed first; as, wicawakaska (them-I-bound}, I bound them.NUMBER. \u00a7 102. Incorporated pronouns, when intended to express plurality, have the plural termination pi attached to the end of the word, whether verb, noun, or adjective; as, wayazarj, he is sick, waunyazanpi, tve are sick; wakaga, / make any thing, urjkagapi, we make; nitasurjke, thy dog, nita- surjkepi, thy dogs your dog or dogs; niwaste, thou art good, niwastepi, you are good. Separate Pronouns. \u00a7 103. The separate personal pronouns stand first in the clauses to which they belong. (a) They stand first in propositions composed of a pronoun and noun, or of a pronuon and adjective; as, miye Isanmatanka, / am an American; urjkiye urjcuwitapi, we are cold. (b) In a proposition composed, of a pronoun and verb, whether the pronoun be the subject or object of the verb; as, bound me. The separate pronouns are not needed for the purpose of showing the person and number of the verb, those being indicated by the incorporated or article pronouns, or58 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGBAPH T. inflexion of tlie verb; but they are frequently used for the sake as, me-was-given), was that given to thy brother? no, it was send me; no, I will go myself. (c) When a separate pronoun is used with a noun, one being the sub\u00ad ject and the other the object of the same verb, the pronoun stands first; as, miye mini kirj niyuzapi (you enemy the you-tooti), the enemies took you. But when the pronoun is the object, as in this last example, it may stand after the noun; as, t6ka kirj niye niyuzapi (enemy the you you-tooti), the enemies took you. (d) In relative clauses, the separate pronoun is placed last; as, wicasta hi korj he miye (man came that me), I am the man who came; 6niciyapi kirj hena urjkiyepi (you-lielp the those vve), we are they who help you. (e) The adverb 'hirjca' is often used with the separate pronouns to render them more emphatic; as, miye hirjca my thine very), truly In answering questions, the sep arate sometimes used he. But more frequently' the verb is repeated in the answer with the pronouns; as, he tuwe kaga he; he miye wakaga (that who made f mean thee. \u00a7 104. When the separate pronouns are used with verbs or adjectives the plural termination is attached to the last word. (a) When the pronoun stands first, it is attached to the verb or adjec- it; niye niwastepi, you are good. (&) When the pronoun stands last, it is attached also to the pronoun; as, tona waorjsidapi khj hena niyepi (as-many merciful the those you), you are they who are merciful. Agreement of Pronouns. \u00a7 105. Personal pronouns, and the relative and interrogative tuwe, who, refer only to animate objects, and agree in person with their ante\u00ad cedents, which are either expressed or understood ; as, he tuwe, who is that? de miye, this is I; tawa, PRONOUNS. 59 Omission of Pronouns. \u00a7 106. The third person, being the form- of expression which most commonly occurs, is seldom distinguished by the use of pronouns. 1. (a) There is no incorporated or article pronoun of the third person, either singular or plural, exceptl wica' and ' ta.' (See \u00a7\u00a7 18. 6,19. 4, 23.1.) (ft) The separate pronoun ' iye' of the third person, and its plural 'iyepi,' are frequently used in the subjective and sometimes in the objective case. 2. But ordinarily, and always except in the above cases, no pronoun of the third person, is used in D akota; as, siyo warj kute ka o (grouse a shot and killed), shot a grouse and killed it; suktarjka kirj yuzapi ka kaska hdepi (horse the caught and tied placed), they caught the horse and tied him. Repetition of Pronouns. \u00a7 107. 1. In the case of verbs connected by conjunctions, the incor\u00ad porated subjective pronouns of the first and second persons must be repeated, as in other languages, in each verb; as, wahi, ka warjmdake, ca ohiwaya, I came, and I saw, and I conquered. 2. (ci) ' Wica' and other objective incorporated pronouns follow the same rule; tatarjka (buffalo the, them- I-saw, and them-I-killed), I saw the buffalo and killed them. (V) So, too, in adjective verbs; -as, orjnisike ca nisihtirj (thee-poor and thee-feeble), tliou art poor and feeble. 3. Two or more nouns connected by conjunctions require the posses\u00ad sive pronoun to be used pronouns may generally be used in Dakota wherever they would be required in English. 1. When a demonstrative pronoun forms with a noun, pronoun, adjec\u00ad tive, or verb a proposition of which it is the subject or object, it is placed first; as, hena tatarjkapi, those are oxen; de miye, (that me-thou-gavesf), thou gavest me that. 2. But when used as a qualificative of a noun, or noun and adjective, it is placed last; as, wicasta kirj hena (man the those), those men; wicasta waste kirj dena (man good the \u00a7 109: The demonstrative pronouns 'he' and 'hena' are often used where personal pronouns would be in English ; as, ate uniasi kirj he wica-60 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AtfD ETHNOGRAPHY. yadapi sni (fattier me-sent the that ye-believe not), my father who sent me, him ye believe not; ate uinasi Mi) he inahdaotaijirj (fattier me-sent the beareth ivitness of me. \u00a7 110. Demonstrative pronouns are often used in Dakota when they would not be required in English; as, isarj kirj he iwa<5u (knife the that I- took), I took the knife. RELATIATE PRONOUNS. \u00a7111. 1. Tuwe, who, and taku, what, are used, both as interrogative and relative pronouns, and in both cases they stand at the beginning' of the phrase or sentence; as, tuwe thou relatest. (a) In affirmative sentences, ' tuwe' and ' taku' are often used as nouns, the former meaning- some person, and the latter, some thing; as, tuwe he manorj, someone has stolen that; taku iyewaya, I have found something. (&) In negative sentences with ' darj' suffixed, tuwe \"may be rendered no one, and taku nothing; as, tuwedarj hi sni, no one came takudarj 3. . \u00a7 112. It has been shown. (\u00a7 25. 1) that compound relative pronouns are formed by joining 'kasta' or '.kakes' to (tvhoever comes if, that I-give will), if anyone comes I will give if I see anything I ivill shoot it, or I will shoot what\u00ad ever I see. ARTICLES. Definite Article. POSITION. \u00a7 113. 1. When a noun is used without any qualificative, the definite article immediately follows the noun; as, maka kirj (earth the), the earth; wicasta kirj waste (man the good), the man is good. 2. When a noun is used with an adjective as a qualifying term, the article follows the adjective; as, wicasta waste kirj (man good the), the good ' man. 3. When the noun is followed by a verb, an adverb and verb, or an adjective, adverb, and verb, the definite article follows at the end of the phrase, and is generally rendered into English by a demonstrative or rela\u00ad tive pronoun and article; as, si6aya oharjyarjpi kirj (men badly do AETICLES. 61 wicasta sica sicaya oharjyarjpi kirj (men bad badly do the), the bad men who do badly. \u00a7 114. The signs of the past tense, ' korj' and l cikorj,' are used in the place of the definite article, and are rendered by the article and relative; as, wicasta warjmdake cikorj, the man whom I saw. USE. ' \u00a7 115. In general, the definite article in Dakota is used where it would be in English. But it also occurs in many places where in English it is not admissible. (a) It is used with nouns that denote a class; as, wicasta kirj bosdan stand suktarjka kirj duzahanpi (horses the. swift), horses are swifi or run fast. (6) It is often used, as in Greek, French, etc., with abstract nouns; as, wo waste kirj (goodness the), goodness; woahtani kirj awihnuniwicaya (sin the destroy s-them), sin destroys them. (c) It is used with a noun, in the vocative case; as, rnaka kirj nahorj wo (earth the hear-thou), 0 earth, hear! (d} As in Greek and Italian, it is used with nouns which are qualified by possessive or demonstrative wicasta kirj de (man the this), this man. (e) It is often used with finite verbs, giving to them the force of as, kagapi the me-pleases), thy coming pleases me. \u00a7 116. In Dakota the definite article is sometimes omitted where it would be required in English. (a) Nouns governed by prepositions are generally used without the article ; as, corjkaske ekta mda (garrison to I-go), I am going to garrison; carj maheii wai lie upon the prairie. (6) Proper names and names of rivers and lakes are commonly used without the article; as, Tatarjka-nazirj (buffalo-stands), The-standing-bii-ffalo ; Wakpa-minisota, the Minnesota river; Mdeiyedarj, Lac-q_ui-parle. (c) When two nouns come together in the relation of possessor and possessed (\u00a7 68), the last only takes the article, or rather the entire expres\u00ad sion is rendered definite by a single article placed after it; as, carjpahmihma the King of the French.62 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. Indefinite Article. \u00a7 117. The indefinite article is more limited in its use than the definite, but so far as its use extends it follows the same rules; as, hoksidarj warj (boy ft), a boy ; hoksidarj waste war) (boy good ft), a good boy. \u00a7 118. Sometimes both articles are used in the same phrase, in which case the definite is rendered by the relative (see \u00a7 113. 3); as, wicasta Avarj waste kirj he kaga (man a good the that made), he was a good man 'who made that. VERBS. Position. \u00a7119. 1. Dakota verbs are usually placed after the nouns with which tney are used, whether subject or object; as, hoksidarj kirj (boy the hast a book. 2. Verbs also are usually placed after the adjectives which qualify their subjects or objects, and after the adverbs which qualify the ivell I-saiv), I saw Waanatan the eloquent man very plainly. For the relative position of verbs and personal pronouns, see \u00a7 98. Number. PLURAL. \u00a7 120. A verb, by its form, designates the number of its subject or object, or both; that is to say, the verb, being the last principal word in the sentence, usually takes the plural ending 'pi' when the subject or object is plural in signification. 1. (ft) When the subject represents animate objects, the verb takes the plural termination; as, manipi, they walk; wicasta kirj hipi (man the came), the men came. (b) But when the subject of a verb denotes inanimate objects, the verb does not take a form for its iiomiiiitive's sake; as, carj topa icaga (tree four grows), four trees grow. 2. (ft) A verb also takes the plural termination when it has a plural object of the first or second persons; as, Wakantarjka urjkagapi (God us- made), God made us; Dakota niye Wakantarjka carjteniciyapi (Dakota you (rod you-loves), God loves -you Dakotas. (&) When the plural object is of the third person, this plurality is pointe'cl out by wica, them, incorporated in the three bears. \u00a7 121. As there is but one termination to signify plurality both of the subject and object, ambiguity is sometimes the result. (a) When the subject is of the first, and the object is of the second person, the plural termination may refer either to the subject or to the sub\u00ad ject and object; as, wasteurjnida,kapi, ive love thee, or ^ue love you. (b) When the subject is of the third, and the object of the second person, the plural termination may refer either to the subject or the object, or to both; as, wastenidakapi, they love thee, he loves you, or they love you. \u00a7 122. Nouns of multitude commonly require verbs in the plural num\u00ad ber; as, oyate heconpi, the people did that. \u00a7 123. The verb 'yukarj' is often used in its singular form with a plural meaning; as, wakiyedarj ota yukaij, there are many pigeons. \u00a7 124. The verb ' yeya' and its derivatives 'iyeya,' ' hiyeya,' etc., have rarely a plural termination though used with a plural subject; as, wicota hen hiyeya, many persons are there. DUAL. \u00a7 125. 1. The dual is used only as the subject of the verb and to denote the person speaking and the person spoken to. It has the same form as the plural pronoun of the first person, excepting that it does not take the termination ' pi.' 2. Hence, as this pronoun is, in meaning, a combination of the first and second persons, it can be used only with an object of the third person, except when, the agent and patient being the same persons, it assumes the reflexive form (\u00a7 24); as, wasteurjdaka, -we two (meaning thou and /) love him; wastewicurjdaka, we two love them. See \u00a7 42. 1. Government. \u00a7 126. Active transitive verbs govern the objective case; (me binds me; wicasta warj warjmdaka (man a I-sa/iv), I saw a man. \u00a7 127. Active verbs may. govern two objectives. 1. A verb may govern two direct objects or so-called accusatives. When an action on a part of the person is spoken of, the whole person is rep\u00ad resented by an incorporated pronoun, and the part by a noun in apposition with the pronoun; as, nape mayaduza (hand me by the hand, or thou takest my hand. Compare the French, (me prendre la main.\"164 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AXD ETHNOGRAPHY. 2. A verb may govern a direct object or accusative and an indirect object answering to a dative. (ft) When one of the objects is a pronoun, it must be attached to the verb; as, wowapi kirj he mayaku kta (book the that me-tlwu-give wilt), thou wilt give me that book. (b) But when both the objects are nouns, the indirect is usually placed before the direct object; as, Heparj wowapi hiyukiya (Hepi apple. verbs with the prepositions 'a' or 'o' prefixed may govern two objectives, and even three when two of them refer to the same person or thing; as, sina kirj anicalipapi (blanket the on-tliee-laicT), kirj omani road; harj, to stand, maka kirj awaharj (earth the on I-stand), I stand on the earth. Possessive Form. \u00a7 130. This form of the verb is used whenever possession or property is indicated, and is very important in the Dakota language. For the ways in which the possessive form is made, see \u00a7 39. 3. The use of this form of the verb does not necessarily exclude the possessive pro- no uu, but renders it superfluous; is also correct. The occurrence of the possessive pronoun does not reader the possessive form of the verb the less necessary. MODES. Imperative. \u00a7 131. 1. In prohibitions the imperative mode is often indicated by the adverb 'ihiiuharj' placed before the verb, wicayadapi kirjharj, do not believe it. This is a stronger form than the common imperative. 2. When two verbs in the imperative mode are connected by conjunc\u00ad tions, the first is used without the sign; as, owirjza kirj ehdaku ka mani wo, take up bed and ivalk.VERBS : INFINITIVE SUBJUNCTIVE. 65 Infinitive. \u00a7 132. 1. Verbs in the infinitive mode immediately precede those by which they are carj kakse he ecorj cisipi, I told you to do that 2. The use of the infinitive mode in Dakota is limited, the finite verb being often used where the infinitive would be in English; as, mda wacirj (I-go I-desire), I desire to go. 3. The infinitive mode can not be used as a noun, as it sometimes is in English; that is, it can not have anything predicated of- it, as in the phrases, \"to see the sun is pleasant,\" \"to walk is fatiguing.\" In such cases verbal nouns gerunds are used; as, wi warjyakapi kirj he oiyokipi (sun seeing the that pleasant}, the seeing of the sun is pleasant.\u00bb Subjunctive. \u00a7 133. What may be called the subjunctive mode isjformed by the aid of conjunctions which follow the verb. (See \u00a7 42.) 1. (a) Kirjharj and its derivatives, cinhan, kinaharj, and cinaharj, usually refer to future time, future events only being considered as uncertain and contingent; as, yahi kirjharj mde kta, if thou come, I will go. But 'kiijhai)' does not always render the sense subjunctive, it being sometimes used as an adverb of time, especially when preceded will go. (b) When anything past is spoken of as uncertain, ' hecirjharj' is com\u00ad it. 2. The conjunctions esta, sta, key as, and kes, signifying though, al\u00ad though, are also used to form the subjunctive mood; as, ociciyaka esta wicayada sni, although hi keyas kici mde kte sni, he come, I will not go with him; amapa kes en ewacarjmi srii, though he struck me, I paid no attention to it. 3. Urjkans, if, usually relates to past time or to something already, known, and is used to state what would have been the case if the thing mentioned had been different from what it is. It is usually followed by tuka, thou hadst paid me, I would if I had a horse I would go. 7105 VOL ix 566 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. Optative, Potential, etc. \u00a7 134. The adverb tokirj, oh that! is used with verbs to express strong desire; in which case an ' n' is suffixed to the verb; as, tokirj mduhen, oh that I had it! '\u00a7 135. The Dakotas have no way of expressing fully and forcibly the ideas of necessity and obligation. The place of the English words ought and must is partially supplied by the word iyececa, fit, proper; as, ecanorj kta iyececa, it is fit that thou shouldst do it. \u00a7 136. 1. The idea of ability or power is expressed by the help of the verb okihi, to- be able, used after other verbs, which are either in the form of the infinitive or gerund; as, ecorj owakihi (to do I-able), I am able to do it, or I can do it; manipi kirj owakihi (walking the I-able), I can walk. Or they are put in form; as, suktarjka mduza owakhi (Jiorse I-'catch I-able), I can catch a horse. 2. Inability is expressed either by 'okihi' with the negative 'sni,' or 'okitpani;' as, I walk. 'T6ka' or 't,6kadarj, followed by the negative 'sni,1 is often used for the same purpose; as, tokadarj mawani sni (any-ivay I-walk not), I cannot possibly walk. 3. The word 'pica' is suffixed to verbs to denote possibility or that the thing can be done; as, ecorjpica, it can be done; warjyagpica, it can be seen. But it more frequently occurs with the negative ' sni;' as, kahpica sni, it cannot be made. TENSES. \u00a7 137. Notwithstanding the Dakota verb has but two distinct forms of tense, there is no difficulty in expressing, by the help of adverbs, etc., all the varieties of time found in other languages. Aorist. \u00a7 138. 1. The aorist is used to denote present time, and generally needs no mark to show that the present is referred to, that being usually determined by attendant circumstances or by the context; as, tiyata yarjka, nakaha warjmdaka, he is at the house, I have just seen him. 2. When necessary the adverb dehan, now, or hinahirj, yet, is used to indicate present time; as, dehan tiyata yarjka, lie is now at the house; hinahirj den urj, he is here yet. 3. The aorist is used in general propositions, which apply equally to present, past, and future; as, siceca waskuyeca wastedapi, children love fruit.VERBS: TENSES. 67 \u00a7 139. 1. The predominant use of the aorist is to denote past time, it being always used in the narration of past events; as, ecamorj, I have done it; he rndustan, I have finished that. 2. (a) By the help of the adverb wanna, now, the aorist expresses per\u00ad fect or finished time; as, warjna yustaijpi, they have now finished it; wanna ociciyaka, I have now told thee. (b) In a 'narrative of past events, 'wanna,' together with the aorist, makes what is called the pluperfect tense; as, wanna yustarjpi hehan wai, they had finished it when I arrived. 3. The aorist used with tuka, but, expresses what is sometimes called the imperfect tense; as, hen waurj tuka (there I was, but am not now), I was there. \u00a7 140. Before naceca, perhaps, the aorist tense is sometimes for the future; as, hecorj masipi kinharj, ecamorj naceca, if they tell me to do that, I shall probably do it. Future. \u00a7 141. 1. The sign of the future tense is usually 'kta.' It may be used with verbs, adjectives, nouns, or pronouns; as, mani kta, he 'Will kta, that will be prairie; he miye kta, that will be I. 2. The future tense is often used in rjarrating past events respecting something that was future at the time mentioned; as, warjna upi kta hehan wai, they were about to come when I arrived there. 3. The future tense is used to denote that a thing would have taken place if something had not prevented. In this case it is commonly followed by 'tuka,' whether the reason is stated or not; as, wau kta tuka, I would have come; upi kta tuka wicawakisica, they would have come, but I forbade them. 4. The future tense with the adverb 'hirjca,' is used to indicate a desire, purpose, or determination to do a thing; as, mde kte liiijca kte hinca ecorj (do will very did), he did it because he wished to do it, or he did it intentionally. 5. The future tense is often used where the infinitive mode would be in English; as, wau kta owakitpani to come; teyapi kta akitapi, they sought to Jail him. 6. The future tense is sometimes used for the aorist, as in German, when there is uncertainty about the thing spoken of; as, tinwicakte khj hee kta (murderer the tJiat-be will), that is the murderer, the idea being, that he will be found to be the murderer.68 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. 7. When two verbs in the future tense are connected by a conjunc\u00ad tion, the first may be either with or without the sign; as, nihinniciyapi kta ka yaceyapi kta, or and iveep. \u00a7 142. 'Nun' or 'nor)' is sometimes used instead of 'kta,' as the sign of the future tense, in interrogative sentences, and also when something future is spoken of as uncertain; as, mda nurj he, shall I go? token ecorjpi nurj tarjirj sni, they knew not what they should do. \u00a7 143. Before the verbs 'ecirj' and 'epca,' 'ke' sometimes marks the future tense of the first person; as, mda ke epca, I tvill go, thought I. \u00a7 144. In interrogative sentences 'hir/ is sometimes used for he,' AUXILIARY VERBS. \u00a7 145. There are several verbs which are used with others as auxil\u00ad iaries; such as, ' iyeya,' 'kiya,' and 'ya' or \u00a7 146. 1. 'Iyeya,' when used with other verbs, expresses the additional ideas of completion and suddenness; as, yustarj iyeya, he made a finish of it; kaksa iyeya, he c^it it off suddenly. In this way 'iyeya' is often used to give force and animation to the style. 2. Verbs used with 'iyeya,' if capable of contraction, are contracted; as, kaptuza, to split, kaptus iyeya, he split it open. 3. 'Iyeya' is often used with prepositions and adverbs, sometimes with and sometimes without their taking the verbal prefixes; as, pamahen into anything. 'Kiya' is used with verbs as a causative suffix; as, ecorjkiya, to cause to do; kahkiya, to cause to make; nazinkiya, to cause to stand. The pronouns are inserted before the causative. \u00a7 148. ' Ya' or 'yai)' is a suffix which occurs so frequently, and whose use is sometimes so different from that of any English verb, that it demands a special notice. 1. (a) It is used as a causative suffix; as, ecorjya, to cause to do; maniya, to cause to walk. In this case it always has a noun or pronoun for its object expressed or understood; as, mani mayayapi, you cause me to walk. (b) 'Ya' used with adjectives makes of them active verbs; as, say a, to dye or paint red; samya, to blacken. 2. (a) It is used with words denoting relationship, where in English we should employ a possessive pronoun, and seems to have the force of toVERBS OF REPETITION. 69 have, or have for; as, he ate way a (that father-I-have), heaven in Father who art in heaven. (V) 'Ya' \\vith nouns shows what use a thing is put to; as, de isarjwaya, this I have for a knife; he tiyopayaya, that thou usestfor a door. 3. When the pronouns 'ma,' 'ni,' and 'un' are used without 'ya' following, 'ya' becomes 'yan;' as, atemayan, he has me for father ; ateunyaijpi, our father. But when 'ya,' tliou or you, follows, the vowel is not nasalized; as, atemayaya, thou hast me for REPETITION. Reduplicated Verbs. \u00a7 149. 1. The reduplication of a syllable in Dakota verbs is very com\u00ad mon. In intransitive verbs it simply indicates a repetition of the action; as, ipsica, to jump, ipsipsica, to hop o? jump repeatedly; iha, to laugh, ilialia, to laugh often. In transitive verbs it either indicates that the action is repeated on the same object, or that it is performed upon several objects; as, yahtaka, to bite, yalitahtaka, to bite often; baksa, to cut a stick in two; baksaksa, to cut a stick in two often, or to cut several sticks in two. Verbs of one syllable are rarely reduplicated. 2. There are some verbs whose meaning almost necessarily implies a repetition of the action and which therefore are generally used in their re\u00ad duplicated form; as, to struggle, etc. 3. Verbs signifying to be are repeated to denote continuance; as, den rnarjka marjke, / continue to stay here; hen dukarj dukarjpi, you reside there. \u00a7 150. The use of a reduplicated form of a verb in its proper place is very important. It is as much a violation of the rules of the Dakota lan\u00ad guage to use a simple for the reduplicated form as to use the singular for the plural number. Verbs icith the Suffixes i s'a' 'S'a' is suffixed to a liar; wamanoi) s'a, one ivlio steals often, i. e., a thief. \u00a7 152. 'Ka' has sometimes the same signification with 's'a;' as, waoka, a good hunter. But sometimes it does not produce any perceptible differ\u00ad ence in the meaning of the verb; as, wasteda and wastedaka, to love any\u00ad thing.70 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AIsTD ETHNOGRAPHY. \u00a7 153. When the verb, to which 'ka' or 's'a' is suffixed, takes the plu\u00ad ral form, the suffix usually follows the plural termination; as, waopika, marksmen; ecorjpi s'a, doers. But in the verb 'da,' to esteem, 'ka' may either precede or follow the plural termination; as, wastedakapi and and 'hiyeya,' all signify to be, but when used, they are accompanied by other verbs, adverbs, participles, or prepositions, descriptive of the place or manner of being; as, mani waurj, / am walking; there; en \u00a7 155. The verb 'e' or 'ee' occurs without a word descriptive of the mode or place of existence; but it is confined to the third person, and is used rather to declare the identity than the existence of a thing. This verb combines with the pronouns, as, 'hee,' 'dee,' etc. 'Yukan' is used to de\u00ad clare that there is, and wanica, that there is none; as, Wakantarjka yukan, there is a God; Wakarjtarjka wanica, there is no God. \u00a7 156. The bringing of two words together in the Dakota language answers all the purposes of such a copula as our substantive verb; as, Wakarjtarjka waste (God good}, God is good; wi kirj kata (sun the hot), the sun is hot; de miye (this 7), this is I; hena inyarj (those stones), those are stones; Danikota (Dakota-tlioii), thou art a Dakota. \u00a7 157. From these examples it appears that there is no real necessity for such a connecting link between words; and accordingly we do not find any single verb in the Dakota language which simply predicates being. The Dakotas cannot say abstractly, I am, thou art, lie is; but they can ex\u00ad press all the modes and places of existence. And the verb of existence is understood in pronouns, nouns, and adjectives. 1 PARTICIPLES. Active. \u00a7 158. 1. Active participles follow the nouns and precede the verbs with which they are used; as, mazakarj hduha yahi (gun having thou-come), thou hast come having thy gun. 1 A. L. Riggs makes the following classification of substantive verbs: 1. Of T)einy or existence, as uij, witb. as, ni un, living is; tarjyaij yanka, (well is), is comfortable. 3. Of prepositions and adverbs of place; as, akan urj, is on ; timahen yanka, within is. 4. Of identity ; e or ee, with the forms hee, dee. See \u00a7 155. 5. Of classification; hec\"a, is such, as, hoksidarj waste heca; lie is a good boy; he sunktoke6a he6a, that is a wolf.PARTICIPLES NOUNS. 71 2. The objective pronouns are used with and governed by active par\u00ad ticiples, in the same way as by verbs; as, mayuha yukarjpi (ine-liaving (thee-having they-go will), they will along. 3. Active participles are used to denote prolonged or continued urj, he is remembering; Wakarjtarjka cekiya urj, the habit of praying to God; iaharj icurjharj, whilst he was speaking. 4. A few participles are used with the verbs from which they are de\u00ad rived; as, maniharj mani (walking walks), that is, he walks and does not ride; nazirjharj naziij (standing lie stands), lie gets up and stands. 5. Two verbs together may be used as participles without a conjunc\u00ad tion; as, ceya patus inazirj (weeping stooping stands), he stands stooping and weeping. . Passive. \u00a7 159. 1. A verb used as a passive participle follows the noun to which it relates; as, tahirjca kirj opi, the deer is shot. 2. Passive participles are used to make what may be called the passive form of the verb; as, ktepi, killed, niktepi kta, thou wilt be killed. 3. They are sometimes used independently as nouns; as, ktepi kin, the slain. NOUNS. POSITION. \u00a7 160. The place of the noun, whether subject or object, is before the verb; as, wamnaheza icaga, corn grows; mini waciij (water I-want), I want water. Occasionally the subject comes after the verb; as, eya Wakaijtaijka, said God. \u00a7 161. When two nouns are used together, one the subject and the other the object of the same verb, the subject is usually placed first (\u00a7 67); as, tatarjka pezi yutapi kirj wicaktepi (Dakota Pawnee the tliem-killed), the Dakotas killed the Pawnees. \u00a7 162. 1. Of two nouns in composition or combination the noun sus\u00ad taining the relation of possessor always precedes the name of the thing possessed. See \u00a7 68. 2. There are cases where two nouns are brought together in which the latter may be regarded as in apposition: as, aguyapi wiconi, bread of life, or more properly, the bread that is life. A. L. EIGGS.72 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. NUMBER. \u00a7 163. The principle on which the plural termination is employed is that of placing it as near the end of the sentence as possible. The order in a Dakota sentence is, first the noun, next the adjective, and lastly the verb. Hence, if a noun or pronoun is used alone or has no word following it in the phrase, it may take the plural ending; if an adjective follows, it is attached to the adjective; and if a verb is used, it is attached to the verb. 1. When nouns are used to convey a plural idea, without qualincatives or predicates, they have the plural termination; as, ninapepi, thy hands; hena Dakotapi, those are Dakotas. 2. When a noun which represents an animate object is to be made plural, and is followed by a qualificative or predicate, the sign of the plural is joined, not to the noun, but to the qualificative or predicate; as, wicasta wastepi, wicasta kirj hipi, the good men have arrived. ' \u00a7 164. The plural of nouns representing animate objects in the objec\u00ad tive case, whether they are governed by active verbs or prepositions, is designated by ' wica' following, which is prefixed to or inserted in the gov\u00ad erning ewicatarjharj them-froin), he is from the Dakotas. ADJECTIVES. POSITION. \u00a7 165. When the adjective is used simply as a qualifying term, it is placed immediately after its noun; as, wicasta waste, good man; carj sica, bad wood. The adjective ikce, common, is placed before the noun which it qualifies, but its derivative ikceka comes after; as, ikce hanpa and haijpikceke,, common moccasins; wicasta, a common man, an Indian. The numeral adjective's, when used with caij, a day, are placed before; as, iionpa caij, two days, etc. \u00a7 166. When the adjective forms the predicate of a proposition, it is placed after the article, and after the demonstrative pronoun, if either or both are used; as, wicasta kirj waste, the man is good; man 167. Adjectives, whether qualificative or predicative, indicate the number of the nouns or pronouns to which they belong; as, irjyarj sapaADJECTIVES. kirj was'akapi, the oxen are strong. 2. Adjectives do not take the plural form when that can be pointed out by the verb of which the noun is either the subject or object (see \u00a7\u00a7 163, 164); as, wicasta waste he kagapi (man good that they-made), men made that; Wakarjtarjka wicasta waste nom wicakaga (Great-Spirit men good two them-made), God made two good men. 3. As the numeral adjectives after warjzi denote plurality by virtue of their meaning, they may be used either with or without the plural termina\u00ad tion; as, wicasta yamni, or wicasta yamnipi, three men. NUMERAL ADJECTIVES. \u00a7 168. 1. Numeral adjectives used distributively take the reduplicated form; as, yamni, three, yamninmi, three and three, yamnimni icupi, they each took three, or they took three of each. 2. Numeral adjectives are used alone to express the number of times an event occurs: as, yamni yahi, thou earnest three times. When a succes\u00ad sion of acts is spoken of, the word 'akihde' is often used; as, topa akihde yakutepi, you shot four times successively. \u00a7 169. To supply the want of words like place and ways in English, the adverbial termination 'kiya' is added to the numeral; as, norjpakiya yakorjpi, they are in two different places; he topakiya oyakapi, that is told in four different ways. \u00a7 170. The Dakotas use the term harjke, one-half; but when a thing is divided into more than two aliquot parts they have no names for them; that is, they have no expressions corresponding to one-third, one-fourth, one- fifth, etc. By those who have made some progress in arithmetic, this want is supplied by the use of 'orjspa' and the ordinal numbers; as, orjspa iyamni (piece third) one-third; or)spa itopa (piece fourth), one-fourth. The language more recently adopted is kiyuspapi, divided. So that one-fourth is topa kiyuspapi wanzi. iyuhpa, all, sakim and napin, both, apa and hurjli, some or a part, touana and wanistirjna, few, a small quantity, urjrna, the other, one of two, ota, many, much, and some others, are sometimes used as adjec\u00ad tives qualifying nouns, and sometimes stand in the place of nouns. \u00a7 172. 1. As the adjective 'ota,' many, much, conveys a plural idea, its reduplicated form ' onota' or 'odota,' is not used when speaking of inani-74 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. mate objects, except when different quantities or parcels are referred to; as, ota awahdi, I have brought home many or much; odota awahdi, I have brought home much of different kinds. 2. When ' ota' relates to animate objects, it may have the plural ter\u00ad mination, but is generally used without it. When it relates to the human species, and 110 noun precedes, it has 'wica' prefixed; as, wicota hipi, many persons came, or a multitude of persons came. 3. When 'ota' relates to a number of different companies of persons, it has what may be called a double plural form, made by prefixing ' wica' and by reduplication; as, wi6okcota ahi, companies of persons have arrived. REPETITION AND OMISSION OF ADJECTIVES. \u00a7 173. 1. When the same thing is predicated of two or more nouns con\u00ad nected by conjunctions, the adjective is commonly repeated noun; as, suktagka kirj Avaste ka danpahmihma kirj waste, the horse is good, and the wagon is good. 2. But sometimes a single adjective is made to apply to all nouns by using a pronominal adjective or demonstrative pronoun; as, suktanka kirj ka carjpahmihma kirj napin are both good; widasta ka winoliirjca kig hena wasteste, Hepi, and Hake, they are all tall. 3. When two nouns are connected by the conjunction 'ko' or 'koya,' .also, the adjective, is only used once; as, suktanka canpahmihma ko sica (horse wagon also bad), the horse and the wagon also are bad. ADVERBS. \u00a7 174. Adverbs are used to qualify verbs, participles, adjectives, and other adverbs; and some of them may, in particular cases, be used with nouns and pronouns; as, iwastedarj mani, he walks sloivly; sicaya hduha un, good; kitarjna tanyarj, tolerably well; he sni is not wood; tonitarjharj he (wkence-thou), whence art thouf POSITION. \u00a7 175. 1. Adverbs are commonly placed before the words which they qualify; as, tarjyarj waui), I am well; sicaya olianyanpi, they do badly; nina waste, very good. 2. (a) The adverbs 'hinda' and 'sni' follow the words which much to do it; ecorj pi sni, they did not do it. (6) The adverbs of time, 'kirjharj,' 'ca' or 'eca,' 'keharj,' and 'coli,' are placed after the words to relate; as, yahi kirjharj, when thou comest; sees it. 3. (a) Interrogative adverbs commonly stand at the beginning of the clause or sentence; as, tokeca wowapi dawa sni he, why dost thou not read f (6) But 'to,' a contracted form\"of 'tokeca' and 'he,' the common sign of interrogation, stand at the end; as, duhe sni to, why or insert personal pronouns; as, nitonakapi he, how many are there of you? tonitarjharj he, whence art thou? hematarjharj, I am from that place. REDUPLICATION. \u00a7 177. 1. Most adverbs may make a plural form by doubling a sylla\u00ad ble, in which case they may refer either to the subject or the object of the verb, and are used with verbs both in the singular and plural number; as, tarjyarj ecorj, he does it well; has done several things ^vell; tarjtaijyarj ecorjpi, they have done well. 2. If the verb relates to the united action of individuals, the adverb is not reduplicated; but if the individuals are viewed as acting independently, the reduplicated form must be used; as, suktaijka kirj tketkeya kin pi, the horses carry each a heavy load. 3. The reduplicated form of the adverb is used when reference is had to different times, places, distances, etc.; as, wicasta kirj dis\u00ad tances. USE CERTAIN ADVERBS. \u00a7 178. 1. In general propositions, 'eca' or 'ca,,' when, is used with 'ecV or 'cV at the end of the clause or sentence; as, waniyetu ca wapa ce, when it is winter it snows. 2. The particles 'ece' and 'ecee,' used at the end of clauses or sen\u00ad tences, signify frequency or habit, as; ecamoij ecee, I am accustomed to do.76 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, ASD ETHNOGRAPHY. 3. The particle 'ce,' in most cases, indicates the close of a direct quo\u00ad tation of the words of oneself God said. 4. The free adverbial particle 'do' is used for emphasis, at the end of a clause or sentence, as, wahi kte do, I will come. It is used generally by young men, and not considered necessary by good speakers. 1 'Ye' is sometimes used in the same way by women and others. 5. Among the free adverbial particles may be mentioned 'wo,' 'we,' 'yo' and 'ye' 'po,' of the imperative; and 'kta' and 'kte' signs of the future. These all follow the verb. See \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 43. \u00a7 179. In reply to questions which have the negative form, assent to the negative proposition contained in the question is expressed by harj, yes, and dissent by come, wilt thou? no, I will come. If the question be put affirma\u00ad tively, the answer is the same as in English. \u00a7 180. 'Tohan' and 'kirjharj' are often used together with the same verb, in which ease 'tohau' precedes the \u00a7 181. When 'itokam' is used in reference to time, it is often preceded by the adverb of negation; as, yahi sni fore thou comest. NEGATIVE. \u00a7 182. 1. Negation is expressed by placing after the verb, adjective, noun, or pronoun, the adverb 'sni;' as, (I-go not*), I did not go; he carj sni (that wood not), that is not wood. 2. An emphatic negation is sometimes indicated by 'kaca,' which, how\u00ad ever, is seldom used except in contradicting what has been previously said; as, yao kaca, thou didst not hit it. 3. A negative used interrogatively often implies permission; as, iyacu sni to (dost take-it?), may signify, thou mayest take it. \u00a7 183. 1. In Dakota two negatives make an affirmative; as, wanica, there is none; wanice sni (there-is-none not), i. e., there is some. 1 'Do' in Isaqyati and Ihagktoqwaq, and 'lo; in Titoijwai), seem to be equivalent to the mascu\u00ad line oral period ha of the Omaha and Ponka, au of the Kansa, Osage, and Kwapa, ke of the lo^ra, ke-i of the Oto, sh of the Mandan, ts of the Hidatsa, and k of the Crow. Ha is seldom used by the Ponka, but is common among the Omaha. J. O. D.PREPOSITIONS. 77 2. When two negative verbs are connected by a conjunction, the first may be without the sign of negation; as, kakipe ca iyotarj tai)ka sni (he- surpassed and more great not) he neither surpassed nor was the greatest. INTERROGATIVE. \u00a7 184. 1. 'He' is the common interrogative particle, and is placed at the end of the sentence; as, wicayada he, dost thou believe f 2. When the person spoken to is at a distance, 'hwo,' compounded of 'he' and 'wo,' is used; as, toki da hwo, whither art thou going f This last is not used by females. 3. Sometimes 'ka' is employed instead of 'he,' as the sign of interroga\u00ad tion; as, he taku hogarj ka, what kind offish is that? 4. Sometimes, however, the interrogation is distinguished only by the tone of voice. Unlike the English, the voice falls at the close of all inter\u00ad rogative sentences. ADVERBIAL INCORPORATED PARTICLES. \u00a7 185. As has been stated (\u00a7 34), by means of adverbial particles, large classes of active verbs are formed from verbal roots and adjectives. There are 'ba,' 'bo,' Verb Paradigm. PKEPOSITIONS. \u00a7 186. Prepositions are placed after the nouns which they govern, and so are properly post-positions. (a) Some are written as separate words (\u00a7 ekta, at the garrison. In this ease plurality of the noun is expressed by ' wica' incorporated into the preposition; as, tatanka kirj wicikiyedai) (ox the them-near-to), near to the oxen; Dakota ewicatarjhan,,/r0m the Dakotas. (6) Other prepositions are suffixed to nouns (\u00a791); as, tintata, on the prairie; magata at the field; <5arjyata, at the woods. (c) And others are prefixed to the following verb (\u00a7 92); as, amani, to walk on; icekiya, to pray for. 2.'(ft) Pronouns governed by a preposition are sometimes prefixed to it, in which case those prepositions which have 'i' for their initial letter cause an elision of the last vowel of the pronoun; as ikiyedarj, to; mikiyedan, near to me; far from thee. If the pro-78 DAKOTA GEAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. noun is plural, the plural termination is attached to the preposition; as, unketanhanpi, from vis. (ft) Sometimes the pronoun is inserted in the preposition, if the latter consists of more than two syllables; as, euitanharj, from tliee. (c) And sometimes it is contained in the following verb; as, en man, lie is coming to me; ekta iiiipi, tliey ivent to two prepositions 'kici' and 'om,' both meaning with, the former governs singular and the latter plural nouns; as, he kici mde kta, I will go with them. \u00a7 188. 1. The names of the natural divisions of time, when they refer to the past, terminate in 'han,' and when to the future, in 'tu;' as, weharj, last spring / wetu, next spring. orignally a preposition, signifying, as it still does in other cases, at or in; and the termination 'haij,' in waniharj, weharj, nidoke- harj, 2. The preposition 'i' prefixed to the natural divisions of time signifies the next after; as, iwetu, the spring following imdoketu, the next summer; ihanhanna, the next morning. CONJUNCTIONS. \u00a7 189. 1. Conjunctions commonly stand between the words or sentences which they connect; as, malipiya ka maka, heaven and earth; wandiyaka tuka iyeciciye sni, ecorj yasi esta ecorj kte sni (do thou-told although, do will not), although thou told him to do it, he will not. 2. But the conjunctions 'ko' or 'koya' and 'alma' are placed after they connect; as, carjka warjhi ko mduha (fire-steel and steel; malipiya maka alma kaga, he made heaven and earth. .\u00a7 190. 'Urjkaij' and 'ka' both signify and, lout they are used somewhat differently, 'ka' denoting a closer connection than 'unkan.' 1. When two or more verbs having the same nominative are connected by a copulative conjunction, 'ka' is commonly used; as, ekta wai ka wanmdaka, J -went and saw. But if a new nominative is introduced, 'unkan' will be required; as, ekta wai unkarj warjmayakapi, I went there and they sa^v me. 2. When after a period the sentence begins with a conjunction, 'ka' is not used unless the sentence is closely connected with the preceding one.CONJUNCTIONS INTEKJECTIONS. . 79 3. ' Unkarj' never connects single nouns or adjectives, 'ka' and 'ko' being used for that purpose; as, waste ka ksapa, good and wise; car) mini ko, wood and water. For the use of the conjunctions kinhan, unkaijs, and tuka, see \u00a7 133. \u00a7 words 'echj' and 'nakaes,' although more properly adverbs, often supply the place of conjunctions; as, he waku, ecirj makida, I gave that to him because he asked me for it; he tewahirjda, iiakaes hecedarj mduha, I refused that because it was the only one I had. \u00a7 192. The idea conveyed by the conjunction than can not be expressed in Dakota directly. Such a phrase as, \"It is better for me to die than to live,\" may indeed be rendered by an awkward periphrasis in several ways; as, mate cirj he waste ka wani kirj he sica, for me to die is good, and to live is bad; wani kirj he waste esta mate cirj he iyotarj waste, although it is good for me to live, it is more good for me to die; or, mate kte cirj he waste ka wani kte cirj he sica, that I should die is good, and that I should live is bad. \u00a7 193. The conjunction or is represented by 'ka is;' but the sentences in which it is introduced have not the same brevity as in English; as, I do not knoiv whether he is there or not, hen urj is ka is hen urj sni, uijma tukte iyecetu sdonwaye sni (there is or there is not, which of the two I know nofi; Is that a horse or an ox? he suktaijka ka is tatarjka urjma tukte hecetu he horse or ox, which of the two)! INTEEJECTIONS. \u00a7 194. Some interjections have no connexion with other words, while others are used only as a part of a sentence. When connected with other words, interjections usually stand at the beginning of the phrase. Consid\u00ad erable knowledge of their use is necessary to enable one to understand the language well, as the interjections not only serve to indicate the feelings of the speaker, but often materially modify the meaning of a sentence; as, hehehe, didita orj mate kta, oh! to! that is; life the that man light the lo! that is), John i, 4,PART SECOND.

The use of the definite article \"kin\" or \"dii^ with the demonstratives \"he\" and \"that\" and \"this,\" as, wicasta kiij de, this man; at other times they are equivalent to \"that which\" or \" what;\" as, Wi6anlipi yanke cnj he, that star which is, 2. Attentiou is called to the almost uniform repeating of the verb \" say\" in dia\u00ad logues ; that is, both before and after the thing said. Before the words said, the form is \" heya,\" whicli is compounded of \" he \" and \" eya,\" that said. It might be \" hecen eya,\" thus said. Then at the close of the words spoken comes in' \"eya\" again, which to us seems superfluous. But it serves to close up and finish off the expression, and is helpfu.1 to a good understanding of the matter. 3. It is commonly affirmed, and admitted in good part, that Indian languages have no substantive verbs; that is, there is no one which corresponds exactly with the90 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. verb \"to be.;' But in the Dakota language there are several ways of expressing it. One that appears frequently in these myths is in, dee, hee, ee, 6ee, and ecee; the last \"e\" is the verb of existence; \" is,\"1 \"it is.\" In cee idea is that of continuance. Heya ecee, he was saying that; that is, he repeated it; he kept on saying it. So also the verb \"un,\" when it can be used, corresponds to our verb \"to be.\" But the use of \"un\" is limited. Then we have \"yanke\" and \"waijke,\" which have reference to place as well as being. But still it remains true that in many cases the Dakotas do not need a substantive verb; lam good they can express by the pronoun and adjective alone, \"ma-waste.\" 4. The study of these Dakota myths has greatly strengthened my former impres\u00ad sions of the necessity of the supernatural. In this myth the deliverer of the people is \"star-born.\" In the Badger and Bear myth the deliverer is created by mysterious power. But everywhere and always the supernatural is recognized. The bad forces, whether the nameless, shapeless thing that swallowed them all up that went for water, or the mythic owl's ear that covered them all in when they went for wood, or the more powerful and tangible force, the north-god, all these and others must be met and con\u00ad quered by the supernatural. So the incarnation of selfishness and meanness, imper\u00ad sonated in Gray Bear, must be overcome and killed by the mysterious born. TRANSLATION. A people had this camp; and there were two women lying out of doors and looking up to the shining stars. One of them said to the other, \" 1 wish that very large and bright shining star was nay husband.\" The other said, \" I wish that star that shines less brightly were my husband.\" Whereupon they say both were immediately taken up. They found themselves in a beautiful country, which was full of beautiful twin flowers. They found that the star which shone most brightly was a large man, while the other was only a young man. So they each had a husband; and one became with child. In that country the teepsiuna, 2 with large, beautiful stalks, were abundant. The wife of the large star wanted to dig them, but her husband forbade it, saying \"No one does so here.\" Then the encampment moved; and the. woman with child, when she had pitched her tent and came inside to lay tlie mats, etc., saw there a beautiful teepsinua, and she said to herself, \" I will dig this no one will see it.\" So she took her digging stick and dug the teepsinna. When she pulled it out immediately the country opened out and she came through, and falling down to the earth, they say, her belly burst open. And so the woman died; but.the child did not die, but lay there stretched out. An old man came that way, and seeing the child alive took it up, put it in his blanket, and went home. When he arrived he said, \" Old woman, I saw something to-day that made iny heart feel badly.\" \"What was it?\" said his wife. And he replied, \"A woman lay dead with her belly bursted, and a little boy child lay there kicking.\" \"Why did you not bring it home, old man1?\" she said. He answered, \" Here it is,\" and took it out of his blanket. His wife said, \" Old man, let us raise 1 As tlic author has said in another part of this volume, \"e\" predicates identity rather than ex\u00ad istence. And this is the case in the cognate languages: e in (pegiha, are in xoiwere, and he\"re in Winuebago, should he rendered \"the aforesaid,\" (Pursh), the Pomme blanche of the Canadians. J. o. r>.DAKOTA MYTHS. 91 this child.\" \"We will swing it around the tent,\" the old man said, and whirled it up through the smoke hole. It went whirling around and fell down, and then came creeping into the tent. But again he took it and threw it up through the top of the tent. Then it gob up and came into the tent walking. Again the old-man whirled him out, and then he came in a boy Avlth some green sticks, and said, \" Grandfather, I wish you would make me arrows.\" But again the old man whirled him out, and where he went was not manifest. This time he came into the tent a young man, and having green sticks. \" Grandfather, make me arrows of these,\" he said. So the old man made him arrows, and he killed a great many buffalo, and they made a large tepee and built up a high sleeping place in the, back part, and they were very rich in dried meat. Then the old man said, \" Old woman, I am glad we are well off; I will proclaim it abroad.\" And so when the morning came he went up to the top of the house and sat, and said, \" I, I have abundance laid up. The fat of the big guts I chew.\" And.they say that was the origin of the meadow lark, a bird which is called tasiyakapopo. 1 It has a yellow breast and black in the middle, which is the yellow of the morning, and they say the black stripe is made by a smooth buffalo horn worn for a necklace. Then the young man said, \" Grandfather, I want to go traveling.\" \" Yes,\" the old man replied, \" when one is young is the time to go and visit other people.\" The young man went, and came to where people lived, and lo! they were engaged in shoot\u00ad ing arrows through a hoop. And there was a young man who was simply looking on, and so he stood beside him. and looked on. By and by he said, \" My friend, let us go to your house.\" So he went home with him and came to his house. This young man also had been raised by his grandmother, and lived with her, they say. Then he said, .\" Grandmother, I have brought my friend home with me; get him something to eat.\" But the grandmother said, \" Grandchild, what shall I do ? \" The other young man then said, \" How is it, grandmother 1?\" She replied, \"The people are about to die of thirst. All who go for water come not back again.\" The star-born said, \" My friend, take a kettle; we will go for water.\" The old woman interposed, \"With difficulty I have raised my grandchild.\" But he said, \" You are afraid of trifles,\" and so went with the Star-born. By and by they reached the side of the lake, and by the water of the lake stood troughs full of water. And he called out, \" You who they say have killed every one who came for water, whither have you gone1? I have come for water.\" Then immediately whither they went was not manifest. Behold there was a long house which was extended, and it was full of young men and young women. Some of them were dead and some were in the agonies of death. \" How did you come here?\" he said. They replied, \"What do you mean1? We came for water and something swallowed us up.\" Then on the head of the young man something kept striking. \" What is this?\" he said. \"Get away,\" they replied, \"that is the heart.\" So he drew out his knife and cut it to pieces. Suddenly something made a great noise. In the great body these were swallowed up, but when the heart was cut to pieces and died death came to the body. So he punched a hole in the side and came out, bringing the young men and the young women. So the people were very thankful and gave him two maidens. 1 Tasiyaka is the name of the large intestine, tlie colon; sometimes applied to the pylorus. Dr. Riggs gives another form of the name of the bird in the dictionary, tasiyakapopopa. J. O. D.92 DAKOTA GBAMMAB, TEXTS. AND ETHNOGRAPHY. But lie said, \" I am journeying; my friend here will niarry them,\" and so he gave them both to him. Then iu the middle of the camp they put up a tent, and the young man with his grandmother and the two young women were brought to it. Then the young man the Sfcar-born proceeded on his journey, they say. And again he found a young man standing without where they were shooting through a hoop. And so, saying he would look on with his friend, he went and stood by him. Then he said, \"My friend, let us go home,\" and so he went with him to his tepee. \"Grandmother, I have brought ray friend home with me,\" he said, \"hunt up some\u00ad thing for him to eat.\" But the grandmother replied, \"How shall I do as you say?\" \"How is it?\" he said. \" This people are perishing for wood; when any one goes for wood he never comes home again,\" was the reply. Then he said, \"My friend, take the packing strap; we will go for wood.\" But the old woman protested, \" This one iny grandchild I have raised with difficulty.\" But, \"Old. woman, what you are afraid of are trifles,\" he said, and went with the young man. \"I am going to bring wood,\" he said; \"if any of you wish to go, come along.\" \"The young man who caine from somewhere says this,\" they said, and so fol\u00ad lowed after him. They had now reached the wood, and they found it tied up in bundles, which he had the people carry home, but he himself stood and said, \"You who have killed every one who came to this wood, whatever you are, whither have you gone?\" Then sud\u00ad denly where he went was not manifest. And lo! a tent, and in it were young men and young women; some were eatiug and some were silive waiting. He said to them, \"How came you here?\" And they answered, \"What do you mean ? We came for wood and something brought us home. Now, you also are lost.\" He looked behind him, and lo! there was a hole; and, \"What is' this?\" he said. \" Stop,\" they said, \"that is the thing itself.\" He drew out an arrow and transfixed it. Then suddenly it opened out, and it was the ear of an owl that had thus shut them up. When it was killed it opened out. Then he said, \" Young men and young women, come out,\" and with them lie caine home. Then again they gave him two maidens; but he said again, \"My friend will marry them.\" And so the young man with his grandmother and the two women were placed in a tent in the middle of the camp. And now again he proceeded on his journey. And he came to the dwelling place of a people, and again he found them \"shooting the hoop.\" And there stood a young man looking on, to whom he joined himself as special friend. While they stood together he said, \"Friend, let us go to your home,\" and so he went with him to his tent. Then the young man said, \"Grandmother, I have brought my friend home with me; get him something to eat.\" For this young man also had been raised by his grandmother. She says, \"Where shall I get it from, that you say that?\" \"Grand\u00ad mother, how is it that you say so?\" interposed the stranger. To which she replied, \"Waziya 1 treats this people very badly; when they go out and kill buffalo he takes it all, and now they are starving to death.\" 'The weather spirit, a mythical giant, who caused cold weather, blizzards, etc. See Ainer. Anthropologist for April, 1889, p. 155. Waziya resembles a giant slain by the Rab\u00ad bit, according to Omaha mythology. (See Contr. N. A. Ethn., vi, pt. i, 22,25.) J. o. r>.DAKOTA MYTHS. 93 Then he said, \"Grandmother, go to him and say, 'My grandchild has come on a journey and lias nothing to eat, and so he has sent me to you.'\" So the old woman went and standing afar off, called, \" Waziya, my grandchild has come on a journey and has nothing to eat, and so has sent me here.\" But he replied, \"Bad old woman, get you home; what do you mean to come here? \" The old woman came home crying, and saying that Waziya threatened to kill some of her relations. Then the Star-born said, \"My friend, take your strap, we will go there.\" The old woman interposed with, \"I have with difficulty raised my grandchild.\" The grandchild replied to this by saying, \" Grandmother is very much afraid,\" and so they two went together. When they came to the house of Waziya they found a great deal of dried meat outside. He put as much on his friend as he could carry, and sent him home with it, and then he him\u00ad self entered tlie tepee of Waziya, and said to him, \"Waziya, why did you answer my grandmother as you did when I sent her?\" But Waziya only looked angry. Hanging there was a bow of ice. \"Waziya, why do you keep this?\" he said. To which he replied, \"Hands off; whoever touches that gets a broken arm.\" So he thought, \"I will see if my arm is broken,\" and taking the ice bow he made it snap into pieces, and then started home. The next morning all the people Avent on the chase and killed many buffaloes. But, as he had done before, the Waziya went all over the field of slaughter and gathered up the meat and put it in his blanket. The \" Star-born \". that had come to th&n was cutting up a fat cow. Waziya, on his round of filling his blanket with meat, came and stood and said, \"Who cuts up this?\" \"1 am dressing that,\" he ansAvered. Waziya said, addressing himself to the young man, Fallen Star, \"From whence have you sprung that you act so haughtily?\" \"And whence have you sprung from Waziya that you act so proudly?\" he retorted. Then Waziya said, \"Fallen Star, whoever points his finger at me dies.\" So he said to himself, \"I will point my finger at him and see if I die.\" He did so, but it was no whit different. Then he on his part said, \"Waziya, whoever points his finger at me, his hand becomes paralyzed.\" So Waziya thought, \"I will point my finger and see if I am paralyzed.\" This he did and his forearm was rendered entirely useless. He did so with the other hand, and it too was destroyed even to the elbow. Then Fallen Star drew out his knife and cut up Waziya's blanket, and all the buffalo meat he had gathered there fell out. Fallen Star called to the people, \"Henceforth kill and carry home.\" So the people dressed this meat and carried it to their tents. The next morning it Avas reported that the blanket of Waziya, which had been cut to pieces, was sewed up by his wife, and he was about to shake it. He stood with his face toward the north and shook his blanket, and the Avind blew from the north, and the snow fell all around about the camp so that thQ people were all snowed in and very much troubled, and they said: \"We did live in some fashion before, but a young man has acted so that now we are undone.\" But he said, \" Grandmother, find me a fan.\" So, a road being made under the snow, she went and said to the people, \"My grandchild says he wants a fan.\" \"Whatever he may mean by saying this?\" they said, and gave him one. The snow reached up to the top of the lodges, and so he punched a hole up through and sat on the ridge of the lodge, and while the wind was blowing to the94 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. south he sat and fanned himself and made the wind come from the south, and the heat became great, and the snow went as if boiling water had been poured on it, and it melted away, and all over the ground there was a mist, and Waziya with his wife and children all died of the heat. But the little, youngest child of Waziya, with the smooth belly, took refuge in the hole made by a tent-pole, where there was frost, and so lived. And so they say he is all that there is of Waziya now. So also this myth is called the Fallen Star.WOTANICE HOKSINA OHA^BLOOD-CLOT . BOY DOINGS THE. WRITTEN IN DAKOTA BY DAVID GREY CLOUD.

The use of ces, which is \"kes\" frequently, is to be noted as indicatingms^or strong desire. \"Father, say this, 'Oh that my son might have good clothes.'\" This is used at the end of the phrase or sentence, and is accompanied by the verbs think or say, in some form. Like to these is \"tokin,\" used at the beginning of the wish.1 2. The life-giving qualities of the sweating process are strongly brought out in this myth. There may be two objects or thoughts in the mind of the Dakota when he makes a \"sweat lodge.\" It is sometimes resorted to for curing disease. That good quality Dr. Williamson always commended. No doubt it often afforded relief to a congested condition of the system. But it was resorted to more frequently fcr the purpose of getting into communication with the spirit world. This is the object here. From the blood of the buffalo, \"which is the life thereof,\" is, by this process, created a man. Is this evolution? The sweat lodge was usually made, as described here, by taking willow boughs, bending them over, making their tops meet and interlacing or tying them together, and thus making a booth, which was large enough for one to sit naked inside and pour water on the heated stones. The whole was covered over tightly with blankets or robes. This is the initipi (eneteepee). The sweater sang as well as sweated. But in this case the object was to have the \"mysterious power\" do its work alone. 3. This myth ends abruptly. It would hardly be true to the thought of an Indian to leave the god-born in the shape of a dog, and that an ugly dog. There inust be a sequel to it.2 TRANSLATION. Once upon a time there was a Badger.who was rich and had many children. He had one arrow, but it was a very long one. And in the bend of a river he had a buffalo surround, which was full of buffalo every morning. When it was so and all started out on one path, he stood behind them and shot his long arrow into the hind-, ermost, and it went from one to another through the whole herd. So the Badger became very rich in dried meat. Then suddenly there came a Gray Bear to his tent. And the Gray Bear said, 1 The Titonwaij use tokii) only in soliloquies. When it is used it must be followed by ni or nil) at tbe end of the clause expressing the wish; as, tokiq he bluha nin, Oh that I had it! j. o. D. 2There is more of this myth in the C'egiha versions. The hero, there called \"The Rabbit's Sou,\" was caused to adhere to a tree, which he had climbed at the request of the deceiver, Ictinike. This latter character corresponds to Uijktomi of the Santee Dakota, whom the Teton call Ikto and Iktouii. It seems better to leave these mythical names untranslated. While the Omaha and Ponka now apply the name Ictinike to the monkey, ape, etc., it is plain that this is a recent use of the term. Ictinike was one of the creators, according to the Omaha myths. After causing the Rabbit's sou to adhere to the tree, he donned the magic clothing of the latter, went to a village near by, and married tho elder daughter of the chief. The younger daughter, becoming jealous of her sister, fled to the forest, where fthe found the Rabbit's son, whom she released. At this point the Omaha version differs from the Ponka. The girl married the Rabbit's son and took him to her home. After several exhibitions of the skill of the young man, a dance was proclaimed. Thither went Ictinike, who was compelled to jump upward every time that the Rabbit's sou hit the drum. The fourth time that he beat it his adver\u00ad sary jumped so high that when he struck the ground he was killed. See Contr. to N. A. Ethuol., vol. vi, pt. i, pp. 43-57, and pt. n, pp. 586-609. J. o. D.102 DAKOTA GBAMMAB, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGBAPAY. \"Wonderful! my brother, that you should live here in such abundance, while.I and my children are starving. If it please you I will coine here and live with you.\" The Badger said, \"Yes;\" and added, \"So we will amuse ourselves.\" And when the Gray Bear was starting home, he took a bundle of buffalo meat and gave to the Gray Bear to' carry home. The next morning Gray Bear came with his household, and as soon as he moved in Mr. Badger was turned out and Gray Bear took possession of all his meat. The Badger lived out doors and starved. The next morning after he took possession, Gray Bear awoke very early in the morning and standing outside said, \"You Badger with the stinking ears, come out, your surround is full of buffalo.\" So the Badger took his long arrow and as lie was accustomed to do shot it through the whole line of buifalo. But the Gray Bear took them all and did not let the Badger have one. This he did morning by morning, but never did the Badger bring home one; and so he and his children were about to die of hunger. But the youngest of Gray Bear's children every morning played with a buifalo leg, and when he was tired playing he tossed them over to the Badger's tent. Thus they maintained an existence. One morning again Gray Bear came out and called, \"You Badger with the stinking ears, bring out your long arrow, your surround is full of buffalo.\" But the Badger did not go; when the Gray Bear said, \"I will crush you if you don't come.\" And the Badger's wife said, \" Old man, in some way consider, for I and my children are starving to death.\" To this the Badger replied, \" Yes, I will go and kill them all, and I will dress and bring home the fattest one, even if he kills me.\" So he went with the Gray Bear and did as he was accustomed to do, killing them all. Then the Gray Bear said, ' You skin and carry home some of the fattest.\" To this the Badger said \" Yes,\" and went to work to dress one of the fattest. When he was finishing that Gray Bear said, \"Why don't you dress another?\" But the Badger would not, and said, \" This alone will be sufficient for my children.\" As yet Gray Bear had not finished cutting up his meat, but when the Badger had tied up his meat and was about to pack it home, Gray Bear said, \" You stinking- eared Badger, get away, you will trample in this blood.\" But the Badger replied, \" No, I am going to carry this home.\" Gray Bear ordered him away again, but the Badger would not go. Then Gray Bear came and pushed Badger down in the blood. Thus, as he fell down in the clotted blood he kissed itj and taking a piece up in his hand he went home crying. By the way he pulled some grass and wrapped it around the blood and laid it away in the back part of his tent. Then he went and brought stones and sticks for a sweat-house, and Artemisia or wild sage, and made a steaming. In the back part of the sweat-house he made a bed of the Artemisia and upon it placed the blood, and then he covered the lodge well on the outside. Then he took a dish of water and placed it within, and when the stones were well heated he rolled them in also and fastened the door. Then he thrust his arm alone inside and poured water on the stones. Suddenly the Badger heard some one inside sighing. He continued to pour water on the stones. And then some one breathing within said, \"Again you have made me glad, and now open for rne.\" So he opened the door and a very beautiful young man came out. Badger at once named him Blood-Clot Boy, and had him for his son.DAKOTA MYTHS. 103 Then Blood-Clot Boy said, \"Now, father, say this: ' Oh that my son might have good clothes.'\" So he said it, and it was so. Then.he said again, \"Say this: 'Oh that my son might have an otter-skin quiver filled with arrows.'\" This he said also, and it was so. Then Blood-Clot Boy pulled a hair out of his head and placed it on the door, and, shooting it with an arrow, split it. And then he said, \"Father, why don't you give me something to eat1?\" But the Badger answered, \"Alas! my son, what do you mean? We are all starving to death. I was very rich in food, but Gray Bear came and took it all from me and drove me out, and now we are starving and will die.\" Then Blood-Clot Boy said, \"Father, I know these things, and therefore I grew. Now, father, do just as I tell you to do.\" To this the Badger said \" Yes.\" Then Blood-Clot Boy continued: \" In the morning when Gray Bear comes out and calls you, you will not go; but the second time he calls then go A\\ath him, for I shall then have hidden myself.\" So very early in the morning Gray Bear stood without and called: \" Stinking-eared Badger, take your arrow and come, your surround is full.\" He did not go; but when he called the second time he took his arrow and went with him. And when they had scared the buffalo, and all had started home on one line, Badger shot his arrow through them all, and dressed the fattest one. Then Gray Bear said, \"Dress it quickly.\" And when the Badger had finished dressing and was about to start home with it, Gray Bear said, \"Badger with the stinking ears, get away, you will .trample in my blood.\" To this Badger paid no attention but continued to prepare to carry. Then Gray Bear came and fell upon him and threw him down in the blood. He arose and went to take up his pack, but again he threw him down in the blood. Then the Badger burst into tears. But then Blood-Clot Boyappeared, and said, \"Why do you treat my father so?\" To which Gray Bear replied, \"My son, this I said, 'My brother, take home meat to your children without delay.'\" But Blood-Clot Boy said, \"No, I saw you throw my father down.\" Saying that he pulled out an arrow, and as Gray Bear fled, he hit him in the little finger and killed him. Then Badger said, \"Do not kill Gray Bear's youngest child, the smooth-bellied boy, for he it was who brought us leg bones and so kept us alive until this time.\" Blood-Clot Boy then went towards home and called to Gray Bear's wife, \"Come out and help Gray Bear.\" So she took her packing strap and said as she approached him, \"How many herds were theref\" Blood-Clot Boy said, \"One herd.\" \"When there are only that, many he has never counted it anything,\" she said. And as she came near she asked again, \"How many herds are there?\" Blood Clot Boy again replied, \"I have told you there was one,\" and he took out an arrow. She said, \"I apprehended this before,\" and fled; but .he shot her in the little finger and killed her. Then he went into Gray Bear's lodge and all bowed their heads. Blood-Clot Boy said, \" Which one of you brought food to my father?\" And all but one with one voice said, \"It was I, it was I.\" Then he said, \"You who said '!,!,' shall you live*?\" And Blood-Clot Boy took his bow and killed all but the one who said nothing. And him he brought into Badger's lodge where he brought water and took up the ashes. Then the Badger became very rich again. Blood-Clot Boy was discontented and said, \"Father I want to take a journey; I want to go to the people that you know live near by.\" And the Badger answered, \"My sou, there is a people living just here, to them you will go. But an old man will come to meet you with the intent of104 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. deceiving you. You must not do anything he tells you to do.\" To this Blood-Clot Boy assented. Blood-Clot Boy was now gone, and behold an old man with a staff came to meet him and said, \"Whither do you go, my grandchild?\" But he replied, \"I am just walking.\" In the meantime a flock of grouse came and alighted. \"My grandchild, shoot one for me, for 1 am starving,\" the old man said. But he answered, \"No, I am going in haste in this direction,\" and so he passed on. It was now evening, and again an old man with a staff was coming to meet him, who sa,t down just before their meeting, and so he came and stood. The old man said, \"Grandchild, although you are-in haste, I will fill my pipe.\" Then Blood- Clot Boy thought, \"I will smoke with him and then go on;\" so he said, \"Yes.\" While they smoked together the darkness came on, and Blood-Clot Boy passed the night without sleeping. In the meantime the old man had fallen asleep; and the day was breaking. Then the young man thought, \"I will sleep a little for it will soon be morning,\" and so he lay down. This old man was the mythic being Unktomi, but the young man knew it not. * While Blood-Clot Boy was sleeping very soundly, the old man that was got up and said. \"What if in some way you are killed?\" Saying which he arose and stood astride of him and bent his back and pulled out his limbs and stretched his ears, and so made him into a very ugly looking dog. The good clothes of the young man he took and put on himself, and liis own old clothes he threw away, and so went on with him. In this way Blood-Clot Boy was made into a dog. It was Unktomi who deceived him and did this to him. Then Uijktonii took the dog with him calling to him, \" O Blood-Clot Boy; wo-hwo! wo-kwo!\" as he went along. And now when Unktomi had come to the people whither Blood-Clot Boy had been going, the dog was ashamed and kept himself outside of the camp, and TJnktoini alone went among the people. Then the people said, \"The famous Blood-Clot Boy is coming,\" and so they rejoiced greatly.LEGEND OF THE HEAD OF GOLD. WRITTEN IN DAKOTA BY WALKING ELK.

Notice the \"yo,\" sign of the imperative, used in various instances instead of \"wo;\" and also the form \"yirj,\" as in \"i<$ahrni6i6iyii) kta,\" for \" i<5alimididiye kta.\" And in \"kda,\" to go home; \"kdi6u,\" to108 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. start home, etc. Another thing uoticable is the abundant use of free adverbial parti\u00ad cles, as, \" e\" at the beginning of sentences and a ye do\" at the end, which can not be translated, and are only used for emphasis or for rouudiug off the speech.1 In the dialogue between the old man and old woman in the beginning of the fable there are a number of examples of the use of the Dakota dual, as, \" unkode,\" \" iyeuijye,\" and \" heconkon.\" TRANSLATION. A man had four children. And they were all young men, but they were poor and seemed as if they would die of thriftlessness. And the old man said, \"Behold, old woman, my youngest child I have greatest pity for, and I dislike to have him die of poverty. See here; let us seek the Great Spirit, and if we find him, lo, I will give him to him to train up well for ine.\" The old woman replied, \"Yes, old man, you say well; we will do so,\" she said. And- so immediately they went to the westward, seeking the Great Spirit, and they came on to a very high hill; and as they came to it, behold, another man came there also. And this man said, \"For what are you seeking1?\" And the old man said, \"Alas, my friend, my child whom I pity I want to give to the Great Spirit, and so I am seeking him.\" And he said, \"Yes, friend, I am the Great Spirit. My friend, give him to me, I will go home with him.\" (That is, \"I will take him to my home.\") And so when he (the father) had given him. he (the Great Spirit) took him home . with him to a house that seemed to stand up to the clouds. Then he said, \"Examine all this house as much as you like; and take good care of these horses; but do not look into the little house that stands here.\" Having said this, he gave him all the keys, and he added, \"Yes, have a watch of this. Lo, I am going on a journey.\" He said this, and went away. It was evening, and he had come home with a great many men, who sat down, filling the house. When they had been there a good while, one of the men said: \"The boy is good; that is enough.\" And saying this he went out. In like manner all the men went home. Then again, the man said: \"Behold, I go again on a journey. Do you stay and keep watch.\" So again he departed. While he was watching, it happened that one of the horses said, \"Friend, go into the small house into which you are commanded not to look, and within, in the middle of the floor, stands something yellow, dip your head into that, and make haste we two are together. When he brings home a great many men, they will eat you, as they will eat me, but I am unwilling we two shall share the same,\" he said. So the boy went into the little house, and in the middle of the floor stood a round yellow thing, into which he dipped his head, and his head became golden, and the house was full of shining and light. Then he came out and jumped on the horse that had talked with him and they fled. 1 \" Ye do\" of the Isanyati (\" ye lo \" of the Ti toy wag), as an emphatic ending, seems equivalent to the Osage \" ei\u00a3au,\" Kansa \"eyau,\" and ^egiha means but \"e<fau\" and \"eyau\" contain the oral period \"an\" (= Dakota do, lo) as well as \"indeed.\" J. o. D.DAKOTA MYTHS. (09 Now when they had gone a long way they went very fast behold, there caine, following them,the one who called himself the Great Spirit. And he said, \"You bad rascals, stop; you shall not live; whither will you go in such a small country as this?\" Saying this he came toward them, when they were much frightened. And again he said, \"You are bad rascals, stop; you shall not live.\" And indeed it seemed as if they should not live. Then the horse said. \"Take the egg you have and throw it rearward.\" And he did so, whereupon the whole breadth of the country became a sea, so that he who followed them, came to a standstill, and said, \"Alas, my horse, have mercy on me and take me to the other side; if you do I will value you very much.\" And the horse replied, \"Ah, I am not willing to do that.\" But he continued to urge him; where\u00ad upon he threw himself above the water, and so that, when he came to the middle, he went down and both were drowned. By this means the boy passed safely on. So it was they came to the dwellings of a people and remained there. But from behind they came to attack, and\" fought with them; but the boy turned his head around, and his head was covered with gold, the horse also that he sat upon was golden, and those who came against them, he caused to be thrown off, and only a few remained when he left them. Again, when they returned to the attack he destroyed them all. And so the boy Avas much thought of by the people. Now, my friends, why did the boy do these things'? He wanted to live some\u00ad where, and he desired to take refuge in the bosom1 of the Great Spirit, perhaps, and so he sought him. When he had found him, then the Bad Spirit sought to make him (the Great Spirit) eat them up. So he fled again he desired to live, perhaps, and fled. But they followed him, so that he again fought with them and killed them all, it seems. It appears that he did not do this of his own purpose. It seems as if no one was chargeable with it, and no one was to be blamed.for it. But they wanted the head (hill) of gold, perhaps, and so they did it. I think that this is like Sitting- Bull.

Out on the lake \"were a great many ducks, geese, and swans swimming. When Uijktomi saw them he went backward out of sight, and plucking some grass bound it up in a bundle, which he placed on his back and so went again along by the side of the lake. Then the ducks and the geese and the swans said, \" dnktomi, what is that you are carrying I\" And Uijktomi said, \"These are bad songs which I am carrying.\" Then the ducks said, \"Now, Uijktomi, sing for us.\" But Unktomi replied, \"But indeed the songs are very bad.\" Nevertheless the ducks insisted upon it. Then Unktomi said, \"Make a large grass lodge.\" So they went to work and made a large inclosure. Then Uijktoini said, \"Now, let all of you ducks, geese, and swans gather inside the lodge, and I will sing for you.\" Whereupon the ducks, the geese, and the swans gathered inside and filled the grass lodge. Then Uijktomi took his place at the door of the grass lodge and said, \" If I sing for you, no one must look, for thafc is the mean\u00ad ing of the song.\" So saying, he commenced to sing: \"Dance with your eyes shut; If you open your eyes Your eyes shall be red! Your eyes shall be red!\" While he said and sung this the ducks, geese, and swans danced with their eyes shut. Then Uijktomi rose up and said as he sang: \" I even, even I, Follow in my own; I even, even I, Follow in my own.\" So they all gabbled as they danced, and Uijktorai, dancing among them, com\u00ad menced twisting off the necks of the fattest and the best looking of the ducks, geese, 7105 VOL. IX 81J4 DAKOTA GRAMMAR. TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. and swans. But when he tried to twist, off' the neck of a large swan, and could not, he made him squall. Then a small duck, which is called Skiska, partly opening its eyes, saw Urjktoini attempt to break off the neck of the swan, and immediately made an outcry: \"Look ye, look ye, TJrjktomi will destroy us all, Look ye, look ye.\" Whereupon they all immediately opened their eyes and started to go out; but Unktomi threw himself in the doorway and attempted to stop them. But with feet and wings they smote him and knocked him over, walking over his stomach and cut\u00ad ting it all up, leaving him lying there for dead. But coming to life he got up and looked around. All were gone. But they say that the Wood duck, which first looked, had his eyes made red. Then Unktomi gathered up the ducks and geese and swans whose necks he had twisted off, and carried them on his back. He came to a river, and traveled along by the side of it till he caine to a long straight place or \"reach,\" where he stopped to boil his kettle. When he had put all the ducks, geese, a.nd swans, whose necks he had twisted off, into the kettle and set it on the fire to boil, then he lay down to sleep. And as he lay there curled up ou the bank of the river, he said, Now, my orjze, if any one comes you wake me up. So he slept. Meanwhile a mink came paddling on the river, and coming to Uijktomi's boiling place saw him lying close by fast asleep. Thither he went, and although the orjze of Unktomi should have given the alarm by closing up, it made a mouth at the mink, at which he stopped only for a moment (till he felt all was safe). Then he pressed on swiftly, and, while Unktomi slept, took out all his boiling and ate it up, putting back the bones into the kettle. Now, when the mink was gone out of sight, the orjze of Urjktoini which he had set to watch told of it. Unktomi commended the faithfulness of his guard, and sitting up looked around, but saw no one. \"Perhaps my boiling is cooked for me. and that is the reason he has waked me,\" he said, and set down his kettle, and taking a stick he found it full of bones only. Then he said, \"Indeed the meat has all fallen off,\" and so he took a spoon and dipped it out, but there was nothing but bones. Then said he, \" Why, my orjze, I thought that I told you to inform me if any one came. I will surely punish you.\" So saying he gathered much wood and put on the fire, and when the fire burned fiercely he turned his orjze to it, and there stood holding it open, although it squirmed even in the death struggle, and then turned it over, so that finally, they say, it fell down a blackened mass and lay there dead. This is the myth of Unktomi and the Bad Songs.1 1 This is a very free rendering of .the original.

The name of the myth: Tasinta means Deer's tail, and from that is applied to the tail of any ruminating animal. Tasiijt-ostaij is the name of the upper joint of the tail where it joins the backbone, and is regarded as a peculiarly nice little piece to roast. As for yukikipi, it is said to belong to the old language, and they do not know what it means. One old woman suggests that yukiki means to twist or rub off. It would then mean deer's-tail-twisted-off. That appears-to correspond with the reason given by the eldest of tlie brothers. In reply to Hakaykayna's question, Who were called Tasirjta yukikipi? lie replied, \" Of all people we only are males, and hence are so called.\" 2. At first one would think that the four young men constituted the household, and that the youngest of those four was called Hakaykayna. But that is not so. Hakaykayna was only a boy and is not counted in the four. He was the fifth, as the name Hakay would necessarily require. 3. It is opportune to note the use of \" nrisun,\" my younger brother, used by the brothers in their collective capacity, both in a direct address to, and also in speaking of, Hakaykayna. Also he uses \" 6inye,\" older brother, in speaking of and to one or all of them together. In like manner they use \" tanksi,\" younger sister (of a man), in speaking of or to the girl, and she uses \"tinido,\" older brother (of a woman), in her addresses to one or all of them. It is like our use of \" brother\" and \" sister\" without the pronoun \" my.\" But the Dakotas always say \" misun \" or \" misunka,\" and a woman always says \" micuij\" and '' mitanka,\" my older sister and my younger sister. The peculiarities of the language in the uses of brother and sister, whether older or youuger, and whether of a man or woman, are well illustrated in this myth; but in the translation I have not thought it needful to add the older and the younger. 4. Everything is possible in a myth, as illustrated by Hakaykayna's suddenly changing himself into a chickadeedee. Animals always have the gift of speech in myths. 5. The wail of the captive girl in her affliction is very affecting: \"Brothers who are called Tasinta yukikipi brothers who once cared for me tenderly.\" The word \" wasasya\" here used is a very peculiar one, expressing great care and love. The same is true of the song or wail of the black caged otter \" Hepan 6inye! Hepan 6irjye! did listen to ine; now I, theDAKOTA MYTHS. 121 bad-furred one, alone am saved!\" Heparj, which means the second son, is the sacred name for the otter. s. R. R. In the Omaha myth of \"The Brothers, Sister, and the Red Bird\" (Oontr. N. A. Eth., vi, Pt. i, pp. 219-226), the youngest brother finds a sister in the manner described in the Dakota myth. In the myth of \" Ictinike, the Brothers, and Sister \" (Contr. 1ST. A. Eth., vi, Pt. i, pp. 79-83), the youngest brother finds the sister who had been carried underground by an elk. J. o. D. TRANSLATION. Behold, thus it was: There were four young men and one who was called Hakay- kayna. These lived together. And so it was that when they went hunting they made the youngest one the keeper of the house, and said to him, \" My youngest brother, don't go anywhere, stay at home.\" Saying this they went to hunt, and he watclied the house. Now the house they lived in was a very long one, but all around the inside the packs were piled up on each other, and also there were scaffolds on the outside, for every day they brought home all kinds of wild animals, and so they had a great abundance of meat. And so, on a time, they went out to hunt and Hakaykayna watched the house, but when he was lonesome he went out to cut arrow sticks, and when something pierced his foot that it was very sore he started home. When he reached the house he opened the sore place, and, lo! he took out a girl baby. And on account of this Hakaykayna, sad of heart, wrapped a blanket around it and laid it back and so was silent. \"Oh that it might grow up!\" he thought, and so was sad of heart until all his brothers came home from the hunt. He had always been glad when they came home, but it was not so now. They judged something had made him sad, and so they said to him, \"My brother, what makes you sad of heart? If anyone has done anything to you, tell us.\" But he said, \" No one has done anything to me, but I have seen what makes me heart-sore and silent.\" And they said, \" What is it?\" And he said, \"Brothers, when you went away I was lonesome and went out to cut arrow sticks, and something stabbed my foot and it was very sore, so that I came home. When I reached home and took it out, it was a baby that I pulled out; and it was a girl baby, perhaps. l Oh, that it might grow up!' I thought, and on that account I aui heart-sore.\" And his brothers said, \"Where is it?\" So he took it up and showed it to them, and they passed it from one to another, and said, \"Oh, that it might grow up!\" Then Hakaykayna said, \"My brothers, come, let us whirl it around the house.\" So they took it up and threw it out of the roof hole and it whirled around and fell down. But now it was a creeping baby and came in crying. Again they took it up and whirled it as before, and then she came in walking, a little girl. But again they took her up and threw her, and she came in a-girl bringing sticks of wood, which she placed on the fire. But again they took her up and threw her as before. This was the fourth time they whirled her, and then she came with a back-load of wood. She untied the strap and came in the house and sat down. Then they asked, \"What relation shall she be to us?\" And one said, \"My youngest brother found her. let him take .her for his wife.\" But Hakaykayna said, \"No, that shall not be so.\" And they said, \"What then shall be her relation to us?\"122 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. and mentioned several terms of relationship. But Hakaykavna did not consent. \"What then,\" they said, \"shall we have her for? What do you want?\" And he said, \"This.one came after us. let us have her for younger sister.\" They all said, \"That is the proper thing.\" So they made her a bed and placed her in the back part of the house. Now she was very skillfnl in needle and quill work. She embroidered quivers, moccasins, knife sheaths, and carry ing-straps for them, so that they greatly rejoiced. When they were to go out hunting they said, \"Now, iny brother, watch over sis\u00ad ter well.\" But when he grew tired, he said, \"Now sister, do you watch, I will go and cut a green arrow stick.\" He went and soon came back, but his sister was not there. He thought she had gone for a little while, and so waited for her to come home. But when she came not for a long while, he went to hunt her. Not finding her, he came in and waited until his brothers came home and said to him, \" My brother, where is sister1?\" When he told them about it, they said, \"Alas, alas! where has our sister gone?\" And they waited and it became dark, and Hakaykayna cried and the broth\u00ad ers all cried with him. Then the oldest one said, \"My brothers, stop crying, soon it will be morning; this island earth is small; we will then see what has made us cry.\" So now when the morning came they started out to each of the four winds, and they went all over the earth. And when they found her not, they were very sad and cut off their hair as they wept. When they had ceased to hunt for her Hakaykayna every day went abroad and walked around, crying. One day, after crying around, he fell asleep, and lo! on waking up, he heard someone crying somewhere. But not hearing it distinctly he went to a high hill and stood on it. Then, lo! somewhere he heard a woman wail out in her crying, \"Brothers, who are called Tasintayookeekeepee; brothers, who once cared for me tenderly, for four seasons I have had a hard time.\" This he heard and said, \"Well! that seems to he sister somewhere;\" and so he started home crying. When he arrived his brothers cried too; but he said, \" My brothers, cease and boil the kettle; we will driuk some soup.\" So they cooked and ate. Then Hakaykayna said, \"My brothers, who are they who are called Tasintayookeekeepee?\" The eldest one answered, \" Of all people we only are all males, and hence are so called. But why do you ask that1?\" And he said, \" I heard a woman wail out that as she cried.\" \"Alas, alas! that is probably our sister,\" they said, and they stood in the fire. But Hakay: kayna said, \"Brothers, cease; if indeed this is our sister she is alive and we shall per\u00ad haps see her again,\" and he cried. Now when the morning came they went and stood with him where he had heard the voice. He said, \"Yes, this is where I heard it.\" Then they heard her again say\u00ad ing, \"My brothers who are called Tasintayookeekeepee, brothers who cared for me tenderly, for four seasons I have had a hard time.\" They heard this cry and said, \"Yes, this is our sister,\" and they all cried. But Hakaykayna said, \"Stop, we shall indeed see our sister in a part of a day, and I will see her first.\" So saying he changed himself into a chickadeedee and went in and saw his sister lying with her limbs fastened and her face covered with sores. He alighted by her, but she did not think it was one of her brothers; and so she said, \"Chickadeedee, if I could only see my brothers I would embroider your breast around.\" And the chickadeedee said,DAKOTA MYTHS. 123 ''My sister, it is I.\" She said, \"Brother, let us go home.\" But he said, \"Presently, my sister. We have now found you. Tell all about it.\" And sbe said, \"Brother, the otters brought rno home. They dug from within the earth, and made a hole up to where I was and dragged me in. Then they closed up the hole in the earth so that you could not find me.\" When she had said this, he said, \"Yes, I will go for my brothers.\" When he came home to his brothers, he said, \"It is our sister.\" And they went with him. And they came to a house that was stretched out very long, outside of which their sister was placed with her four limbs fastened. Then she said, \"My brothers, 1 have been now four seasons in this suffering state, but I am still alive, as you see me. That is owing to oue tiling, of which I will tell you. There are five kinds of otters here; one is red, one is blue, one is yellow, one is white, and one is black. It is because of the last one that I am alive, brothers. When they boiled fish and threw out the bones they emptied the bones and the hot soup upon me, so that I am burned by the heat, and the bones pierced me so that niy face is all sore. That is the reason of my being' so. But when the black otter came to empty out the bones he would put into my mouth some of the meat and of the soup also. On account of that you see me alive. Therefore my desire is that the black otter may live.\" \"When the evening comes then they return from their hunts. When the red one comes he makes red lightning shimmer through the house, when the blue one comes he lights up the house Avith blue lightning ; when the yellow one comes he makes yellow lightning shoot through the house,- when the white one comes he make white lightning shine through the house.\" Now, when her brothers had made themselves war clubs they took their stations at each side of the door of the long house. Now it came to pass when the red light\u00ad ning gleamed through the house and the red otter put his head in at the door and said, \"My house smells of something,\" then they killed him and drew him inside the house. Then, again, the blue lightning gleamed through the house, and as he said, .\"My house smells of something,\" he put in his head, but they killed him and drew him into the house. The yellow lightning gleamed through the house, and the yellow otter, saying, \"My house smells of something,\" pushed in his head, but they killed him and pulled him into the house. By and by a white lightning gleamed through the house aud a white otter pushed in his head, but they killed him also and drew him into the house. Then the black otter came home, and the sister said, \"That is the one that did it.\" So they took him alive. Then they cut all the cords that bound their sister aud washed the sores on her face, after which they took her and the otter to their home. Now, when they had come home they watched over their sister better, and they took good care of the otter that they saved alive. But he was always sad of heart, and as he sung to himself, he said, \"Brothers Haypau! Brothers Hay pan! I said we ought to use a different ladle; you did not listen to me, and I, the bad-furred one, alone am saved. Brothers Haypan ! Brothers Haypau!\" And they said this to him, \" You did well to us, and therefore we want to treat you well, but if you are going to be always sad of heart, you shall do what pleases you; if you want to go where you please, so you shall do.\" And he said, \"Yes, I want to be free to go where I please.\" And they said to him, \"Go, you shall be called the Western Child Otter.\" And they let him go. Therefore they say it is that now there are only black otters.CHEE-ZHON, THE THIEF.1 WRITTEN IN DAKOTA BY said: Son, work the that most difficult I esteem that, she said.

There was ouce a widow who had a son. When the boy was well grown his mother inquired what trade or business would suit him. The boy replied that he would like to be a robber. The mother said she very much disliked that business. But the boy repeated that he would have that, and then proposed to his mother to go 1 Iyeya does not mean '-'to tear,\" but conveys the idea of forcible or sudden action. J. o. D.128 DAKOTA GRAMMAR TEXTS. AND ETHNOGRAPHY. and ask the spirits. While she was going on this errand he went around and reached the house of spirits first, and he instructed them how to answer his mother. The mother came home crying. When the boy asked her what employment had been assigned to him, she had to reply, \"The work that I think difficult.\" But the boy said, ''Never mind, mother, soon we will be rich.\" Then he went away and brought home a horse; and again he brought home cows, sheep, and all kinds of domestic animals. - One day his mother came home from the village crying, and told her son of a plan to take off his head the next day at noon if he did not get possession of the chief's wife's finger ring. He told her to be quiet, and said, \"That is nothing.\" Then in the evening he took his own clothes and stuffed them. He made a ladder, and taking the stuffed man and the ladder he went to the chief's house. The ladder he placed upright and looked in at a window. The chief was lying asleep with a pistol in his hands. As the young man shoved up the window he held in it the grass man. The chief was waked by the noise and fired his pistol. Cheezhon, which was the young man's name, let fall the grass man, and while the chief went to seek the man he supposed he had killed, Cheezhon made his way to the chamber, and said to the chief's wife, \"Hand me the finger ring; that was not Cheezhon, but I have killed him.\" Whereupon she gave it, and he took it home. Afterwards the chief came in and said to his wife, \"Hand me the finger ring; that was not Cheezhon, but I have killed him.\" To which she replied, \"It was but just now you said that, and I gave up the ring.\" To which he said, \" Really, that was Cheezhon, and you gave it to him after all!\" In the meantime Cheezhon reached his home, and saying to his mother, \" See, this is what yon cried for,\" he handed her the ring. Sometime after this his mother came home from the village again crying, when Cheezhon said, \"Mother, what do you mean? When we were not rich you did not cry, but now we are rich you are always crying.\" On which the mother said, \" My son, the chief said that he himself would come and take you.\" But Cheezhon made light of this also, and said, \"Mother, that is nothing.\" In the meantime he went on making a small whistle, which he finished. Then he told his mother to fill a large entrail with blood and put it under her clothes. \" When he comes,\" said he, \" I will stab you with this knife, but I will only run it into the eutrail, but as there will be blood he will think I have killed you; and when I blow on this whistle you will stand up again.\" On the morrow at noon the chief came and saw Cheezhon stab his mother. He was much astonished, and said, \" Cheezhon, you were always a fool, but this beats all the rest.\" But Cheezhon replied, \" What do you mean by saying that? I have done this that I may bring my mother to life again.\" So he took up his whistle and blew upon it, and his mother stood up. The chief then offered him any sum he might name for the whistle. But Cheezhon said, \"I have paid a great sum for the whistle, and I do not want to sell it. When anyone asks me to bring back to life one who is dead, I can do it by means of this, so I value it very highly.\" But the chief repeated that he would give him any sum, and Cheezhon named five hundred dollars. This was given and the whistle taken home. Then the chief called all the people together, and said he would do a thing. Then all the principal men came, and theDAKOTA MYTHS.' J 29 chief proposed to stab his wife, kill her, and then restore her to life. When he had stabbed her and killed her he blew his whistle over her to bring her to life, but she lay there dead. He was thereupon much enraged. Then Oheezhon's mother came home and told him that in' the morning they planned to put him in a bag and cast him in the water. But he laughed and said, \" Mother, that is nothing.\" It came to pass the next day at noon the chief came and took Cheezhon home with him, and commanded his soldiers to put him into a bag and cast him into'the water. And when they bad placed him in the bag and carried him along and were now near to the place, the chief said, \" Call them and take him home.\" Just then Oheezhon heard some one calling sheep, whereupon he cried out, \"I do not want to live with the chief's daughter! I do not want to live with the chief's daughter!\" So tbe shepherd came and said, \"What do you mean?\" Said Cheezhon, \"They say I must live with a daughter of the chief, and I am not willing; nevertheless, they are taking me there.\" The shepherd replied, \"I will go.\" So they tore open the bag, released Cheezhon, and bound the other man whom they put in the bag. In the meantime the flock of sheep was scattered, and Cheezhon, having his lib\u00ad erty, drove them to the woods and there kept them. After sometime he brought the whole flock back to the chief's house and said, \"If you had thrown me far out into the water there would have been blue horses and oxen with horns of gold.\" Then the chief said, \"Are you indeed telling the truth?\" And Cheezhon said, \"I am indeed telling the truth.\" Then the soldiers, as fast as they were able, cast themselves into the water (to find the blue horses and the oxen with horns of gold). And the chief also, they say, threw himself into the water and was drowned. Thus Cheezhon saved himself. 7105 VOL ix 9THE YOUNGER BROTHER; OR, THE UNVISITED ISLAND.

That is all. resurrected, NOTES. 1. On furnishing this myth Mr. Renville remarked, \"It is another Joseph.\" By which he did not mean that the Dakota legend had received anything from the Bible story; bat that the impure desires of a wicked woman had worked out similar results. In the whole structure of it there is evidence that this is a genuine Dakota myth. 2. It will be noticed that the language of the Dakotas has simple words to ex\u00ad press younger brother, (surjka), father-in-law, (turjkarj), etc. These all are found in the myth, and others like them exist in the language. However they may have been formed in the first place, these words are now beyond analysis. Now it is claimed that the existence in a language of such rad\u00ad ical words expressing relationships is evidence of descent from a higher civilization. Whence came the Dakotas? 3. In all Dakota myths Unktomi is represented as the incarnation of evil. Here it overreaches itself and is properly punished. But the annihilation of it is only local and temporary. 4. This myth gives the best characterization of this great water god, Unktetii, which answers to the Neptune and Poseidon of the Greeks and Romans. Also it portrays vividly the eternal enmity that exists between him and their Jupiter Tonans the Wakirjyarj. 5. The word 6eguka, translated soft-stone, is of somewhat uncertain signification. What was it the old woman burned and sprinkled in the eyes of Uijktelii to enable him to swim so long in the light1? The analysis would seem to be the skin of a Icettle. The word cega is now applied to all iron kettles as well as wooden buckets. But the original cega was undoubtedly earthen. Then the uka, the slcin, would mean the glazing. This, too, would point back to a higher civilization. 6. The element of the supernatural is prominent in all the Dakota myths. Here in answer to his prayer the earth opens and the gopher comes to his assistance, while the aid of the badger is no less needed for his deliverance and victory. And not only is deliverance secured by supernatural help, but the race is elevated by a mixture with the gods. 7. It is significant that, after this miraculous passage across the water, they find the mainland uninhabited. The spirit of Evil has destroyed the race. But, as Deucalion and Pyrrha repeopled the world by casting \"the bones of the earth\" behindDAKOTA MYTHS. 139 them, so here the Younger Brother repeoples his fatherland by burning up the Evil One and sowing the ashes. 8. The use of sni in the following phrases is peculiar: Tuwe tokeca kute yasi sni, Why do you not tell some one else to shoot fWho different to shoot you not at command Tuwe kasta kici de sni, Why do you not go with someone else?\"Who soever with him you go not In these two, sui has the force of why not f Sung, ito wiijtka pahi urjye sni, Younger brother, come, we have not (yet] gatheredYounger come egg to gather we two not brother go eggs. But this last implies a request, Gome, let us gather eggs. J. o. D. P. 134, line 1. He, from han, to stand on end, as an inanimate object. See p. 7, \u00a76, c. J. O. D. TRANSLATION. Once there was a people, the chief among whom had three beloved children, two boys and one girl. The eldest son married a wife and the younger brother lived with him. But the sister-in-law troubled her brother-in-law, \" Let us lie together,\" often saying to him. But he always answered, \"How can I make my older brother ashamed, seeing lie sets such store by me?\" One day, when the woman had brought home some wood, she said, \" Brother- in-law, yonder are many prairie chickens; shoot one for me.\" To which he replied, \"No; I am not a hunter; send some one else to shoot them.\" But his brother said, \" Shoot them for her.\" So he took his arrows and shot one for her, and .said, \" There it is, take it,\" and so went away. After awhile the woman came home crying, and said to her husband, \" Your younger brother persists in troubling me. But when I tell you of it you do not believe me. See, this is what he has done to me,\" and she showed him where she had scratched her thighs all over with the prairie chicken's claws. Then he believed her, and said, \"Go call Uijktomi.\" And Unktoini came. Then he said, \" Uijktomi, you take my younger brother to the Uuvisited Island and leave him there, and you shall have my sister for your wife.\" The young man came home and Uijktoini said to him, \"My younger brother, come, we will go and hunt eggs.\" But he said, \" No, I can not. Go with some one else.\" But the elder brother said, \" Go with him,\" and he went with him. They entered a canoe and went to the island and gathered eggs. And when they had filled the canoe the young man said, \" Let us go home.\" And so they got into the boat. But Urjktorni said, \"Brother, yonder .are some nice ones, get them also.\" The young man replied, \" No, we have now a great plenty.\" But Uijktomi was persistent, so the young man went and got the eggs. In the meantime Urjktorni had turned the head of the canoe outward and was starting home. \"Halloo, Uijktomi, bring the canoe here,\" he said. But Uijktomi answered back, \" What are you killing yourself about?\" \"Halloo, bring it here,\" he repeated, but he would not. Then he said, \" Uijktomi, bring the canoe here; when we reach home you shall have my sister for your wife.\" He replied, \"That is what I am doing this for.\" The young man continued to plead. Uijktomi bade him eat his own dung, which he would willingly do if the canoe would come for him. Uijktomi laughed at him. Then the young man140 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. said, \" Yon meaii, bad fellow, you have deceived me,\" and so he reviled him. Unktoini answered, \" Go away, yoa will see the Great Mosquito.\" Again he reviled him. \" Go,\" said Unktomi, \" you will see the Gray Bear.\" He repeated it, and Unktomi said, \" Go away, you will see the Arm-awls.\" Again he cursed him, and the answer was, \"Go, you will see His many-dogs.\" Then for the last time he reviled Unktomi, who said, \" Go, you will see the Two Women,\" and then he came home. Then the young man also departed, and when he heard something above come whizzing along, the Great Mosquito fell into the water, and he threw himself under it. But, lo! something like a brown crane came and stood and said, \" That thing that was moving about here as I was coming has gone somewhere. Indeed, if it were here I would do so to it,\" and he struck the mosquito with his bill. But as the bill stuck in, he (that is, the young man) in turn killed the crane, cut his bill off, and carried it along. Again the young man heard something, and the Gray Bear came crying out against him. But the young man changed himself into a dead fish and lay on the water. Then said the Gray Bear, \" What was here moving about when I was coming has gone.\" The Gray Bear came, and saying, \" I will eat whatever is yonder,\" he took the fish in his mouth. But, as it was flat, he turned it from one side of his jaws to the other, and finally swallowed it whole. But in the belly of the bear the young man resumed his shape, took his knife, and cut the bear's heart to pieces, and so killed him. Then he cut a hole in the side and came out, and having cut off the two fore paws he took them along. As he went along in the path there stood a bark lodge, from which smoke issued. He immediately thought, '' These are what he called the Arm-awls,\" and so he wrapped his blanket up into a bundle, and placing it under his arm. he went into the lodge and sat down in the back part, saying, \" Lo! my grandmother, I would come into the house.\" Now, there were two old women sitting, one on either side, and making a disturbance about something at the door. Then, rising to his feet, he said, \"Grand\u00ad mother, I have come into the house, but you are not pleased; I will go out again.\" And as he said this he made pretense of going out, but threw his bundle at the door. And they with their elbows both pierced it, but, as it was only a blanket, they thrust through further than they had intended and stabbed each other. \" My cousin, you have killed me,\" they both said. But he said, \" Did such as you think you would kill me1?\" and at once he killed them both and went on. Then he heard some one ahead saying aloud as he came, \"Gome, come, my dogs.\" And while he came on calling his dogs, the young man made his nose bleed and besmeared all his arrows with blood and spread them out in the path and lay down on his back. Then there came a lion and a great lynx and licked them. But the owner of the beasts said, \" Let him alone, and go along, this is a poor child.\" So they passed on. Then the man came and said this: \"Ah! my grandchild, you are the one that they say A\\ras left on the unvisited island. Go on, there are two of my dogs coming behind, those you may kill and eat.\" This was the one called His-many- dogs, because they say he has all things that move upon the earth for his dogs. Then the young man rose and went on. And two raccoons came along, talking to each other. He killed them and carried them with him. Then he came to a bark- lodge which was standing in the path, and, laying down both the raccoons outside, he went in. There were two old women, one on either side of the house, and he sat down m>the back part of the tent. Then they said: \"Grandchild, are you the oneDAKOTA MYTHS. 141 who was cast away on the nnvisited island?\" These were good old women. Then one said: \"Even if one is almost dead lie eats; cook something for him.\" Then they boiled for him nnd gave him food and said: \"Grandchild, you have come through many difficulties, but the hardest is yet to come.\" And he said, \"Grandmother, I brought two raccoons and laid them outside, take them.\" So they took them and boiled them. Then one said to the other, \"Give some counsel to my grandchild.\" Whereupon she said: \"Grandchild, you will go to the house of The Two Women. They will treat you well, but at night they will seek to kill you. But we shall be there with you.\" Saying this, she pulled out a tooth and gave to him. And they say the other one gave him a bundle. The one who pulled the tooth and gave him was the Gopher; and the other who gave him the bundle was the Badger; he tied up his ear and gave him. Then one of the old women told him what to do. \"When you lie with one of the Two Women and she covers you with a blanket so that you can not breathe, pierce a hole in the blanket with this tooth, and you shall breathe freely; then untie the bundle. When they give you food, you will look to the earth and say: ' Grand\u00ad mother, whither have you gone, and at once we will be there with you.'\" Then he traveled till he reached a very large tent. And outside of it there was a bark lodge. He entered into the tent and sat down in the back part. But no one was there. But when the evening was coming on he heard young women laughing loudly. In the bark lodge he had seen an old woman, who now said; \"Come quietly, you big-eyed courtezans.\" So when one of them would have entered she saw him there, and saying, \"My house smells of something,\" she turned back. Again the other came and said the same thing and went again. But now, when both had come home, one of them went to cooking for him. And she gave him the half of a man cut up. This she put in a dish and placed before him. He bowed his head and looking to the earth said: \"Grandmother, where have you gone ? \" Lo! from the earth there came a white mouth pushing up and sat down. So he emptied it all in and handed the dish back. And the young woman said, \"My younger sister, now we two have mysterious man food.\" Then the other young woman also gave him her man-flesh, which he took, saying, \"Grandmother, whither hast thou gone?\" And from within the earth a white mouth came and sat down. So again he poured all the food in the mouth and handed the dish back. And the young woman said, \"My older sister, now we two have mysterious man-food.\" When it was now dark one of the young women lay down with him, and covered him with a blanket; but it was very heavy, so that he could not breathe. Then he pierced a hole through it with the gopher's tooth and with his nose through it he lay breathing. The woman thought something was wrong and touched him. But just then he untied the bundle, and the woman threw off the blanket and started off ex\u00ad claiming, \"A man has made a hole in my side.\" That blanket was the clear sky olanket. Then the other young woman in turn lay down with him, and put over him a covering that was so very heavy that he could not breathe. Again he punched a hole in it with the gopher's tooth, and lay breathing. Again there was the touch. She thought he was dead. But he untied the bundle; when she suddenly exclaimed: \"A man has made a hole in my side,\" and threw off the blanket. This was the black cloud blanket. In this way, as the story is told, he made them both good and married them both.142 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. Then he said to them, \"You must change your food.\" But, \"What shall we eat?\" they said. To which he replied; \"No one should eat ineu; it is bad food: there are plenty of other things good to eat.\" And they believed him, and so left off eating men. Now, in process of time they each had children, and both were boys. Then sud\u00ad denly the husband thought of his old home and was sad and silent. The wives said to him, \"Why are you silent?\" He said, \"Because I am sad.\" \" It is not far away, we will go home with you,\" they said; and then they said to their mother, \"Mother, burn soft stones. He is sad and we will take him home.\" So the old woman burned soft stone. Then the wives said, \" Call father.\" So the mother-in-law stood' by the side of the water and said; \"Old man, come, my daughters will go to the main land.\" Then immediately something floated up from the water and came to the shore. The wives put their husband in a bag. What appeared was the husband of the old woman, and the young women were his children. They say it was Urjktelii. So when the Unktelii had come to the shore, they filled both his eyes with the burnt stones, and on his many horns they piled the baggage, and their husband they placed among the baggage. He said, \"My daughter, I sineil some live thing.\" But they said \"Bad old man, what is there to be smelled1?\" To which he replied \"Oh.\" Thus they set off. Moreover he said, \" Let my grandchildren take little sticks and when I move slowly let them drum on my horns.\" He also said, \"My daughters, keep a sharp lookout.\" This he said lest the Thunder should come. For the Thunder and the Urjkteh'i are enemies. . Now, as they went over the water towards the mainland, he said, \"My daugh\u00ad ters, something overshadows me.\" He said this because it had clouded up and he knew it. But they said, \"What is there to shade you; it is all clear sky.\" In saying this they deceived him, for already the clouds had come over. And now when they approached the shore the Thunder came nearer. But when they came to land they put ashore their husband first and then took off all the baggage; and then they said, \"Go away, father; the Thunder is near.\" \"Alas! my daughters, I thought so,\" he said, and started home. But just then the Thunder shot him, and the Avater all over turned to blood. The young man said, \"Alas! my poor father-in-law!\" But they said, \" He will not die of that. Although that is done, he never dies.\" They had now returned to the place whence he went out, but where the people had gone was not manifest. So he said, \"Put up the tent here, while 1 go over yon\u00ad der.\" He went towards the spring of water, when lo! he saw a woman with a head so large coining. \"That is my sister,\" he said. She was coming her head was the proper size, but her face was all broken out in sores. \"Yes, that was my sister,\" he said; and as she said, \"My brother that was,\" he embraced her, and said, \"My sis- .ter, how is it?\" \"My brother,\" she said, \"Unktomi has destroyed all our people. Me alone he has saved, but has treated me very badly. When I come thus for water and go back, he says, iNow somebody has been courting you,' and he sprinkles hot ashes on niy face, and so my face is all over sores.\" Then he said to her, \"Go, take home water, and if he says that again, say to him, 'You have destroy* d all the peo\u00ad ple; who is there alive to say anything to me?' Then throw the water on him, and come hither; I have pitched my tent here.\" So she took the water home and went in; wherefore again Unktorni's face was flushed, and he said, \"Now some one has been courting you indeed.\" But she replied,DAKOTA MYTHS. 143 \"See, yon have destroyed all the people; who is there alive to say anything to nie1?\" And she dashed the water on him. He only laughed and said, \" Woman, has my brother-in-law coine home?\" She replied, \"If you had been left on the unvisited island would you ever have returned?\" Then she left him and came to the tent of her brother, who commanded his wives to hasten Avith the preparations for his sister. So they heated water, washed her, combed her hair, put beautiful clothes on her, and placed her in the back part of the tent. Then the man said to his two boys, \"Go, call Unktomi.\" They went and said, \"Unktoini, we call you.\" He said, \"Oh, how beautiful my nephews are,\" and followed them to the tent of his wife's brother. He was going in to see her who had been his wife, now dressed so beautifully and seated in the back part of the tent; but the young man said, \" Sit there in the door.\" To which Unktomi made answer, \"Yes, my brother-in-law, I will do what you say.\" When he was seated, the young man said, \" Urjktoini, eat your own dung.\" And they say he did so. This was done to be avenged, because Uijktomi had once told him to do the same. Then the young man said, \" Weave tamarack roots; weave the basket just your own size and make it come close around your neck.\" And Ugktomi did so. \" Sit down in it.\" And Unktoini sat down in it. So the young man pressed Unktomi in and hung ifc over the fire. Unktomi squirmed, but the young man said, \"Pile on wood.\" So he killed Unktonii with the smoke, took out his heart and dried it, pounded it up fine and made medicine of it. Then he gave it to his two boys, and said, \" Go, scatter it on the ruins of the village.\" And they did so. When the next morning came, he said to them, \" Go see the medicine you scat\u00ad tered.\" They returned and said, \"Father, all over there are things like worms crawling.\" The next morning he sent them again. They returned and said, \"Father, the things are now very large.\" On the third morning he sent them again. They brought back word, \" Father, they are little men. l Stand up! You are crooked,' they said to each other; and so they stumbled along,\" they said. On the fourth day the people were perfected, and at daybreak, with drum-beating, yelling, making proclamations, aud great noise, they came and pitched their tents around the tent of the young man, whom they made their chief. Thus they say that by means of Uijktomi's heart the people were brought to life again. That is all.WAMNUHA-ITAGO&A. SPITTER.

[aforesaid] NOTES. 1. The form, Boy-beloved, is said to be used only of the first-born or eldest son of a chief, and so would stand for Prince. It is 'hoksidarj,' &OT/, and 'cantekiya/ to love. This is put in the plural and passive form, and so means .Beloved-Son. 2. This myth shows that plurality of wives is a custom of ancient date among the Dakota, and that the taking of sisters was a common form of it. Further, the myth shows a very low state of social morality. To the question, what laws or im\u00ad memorial usages among the Dakota, restrain them in their matrimonial alliances, M. Eenville answers, \"There are no laws that is,laws with penalties to prevent a man from taking his sister to wife, or even his mother, but we simply say such a man is like a dog he is a dog.\" That they often have largely transgressed the line .of pre\u00ad scribed consanguinity, in taking wives, is evidenced by the name Kiyuksa being worn by a number of the sub-geutes in the Dakota nation. This dividing or breaking of custom is uniformly referred to their matrimonial alliances. 3. It is interesting to note in these myths the origin, or at least the explana\u00ad tion, of certain singular forms of speech in the language, which it is impossible to account for otherwise. For example, in this myth, we have ' &yaka-o,' Teal-shot,148 DAKOTA GRAMMAR,. TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. which means a boil, the core of which is the mythical arrow of box-elder which the Teal drives in, even from beyond the lake. 4. Rather a beautiful mythical idea is that the roots of the tall reeds are made red by the blood of the snipe, which is the grandmother of the teal. Another, which is quite as good as our \"man in the moon,\" is the translation of the Teal, with the gory head of Boy-beloved, together with Sharp-grass and his executioner's knife, to the broad land of the Night Sun. TRANSLATION. There was a Boy-beloved whose spittle was all kinds of beautiful beads. So abundant were they that his people arrayed themselves therewith. As the fame of this spread abroad, the young women of surrounding tribes were all anxious to have him for a husband. And as.a certain maiden was going to make him her husband, if possible, she heard behind her some one laughing. She stopped, when lo! two women came up and said, \"Why, here stands Heart-Killer.\" And they added, \"Come along, Heart-Killer, wo are going to make the Bead-Spitter our husband5 let us go together.\" So she went with them. These two young women Avere called \"The Two-Women.\" They did not grew from the people, but grew wildly and were supernatural beings, hence their name, \"The Two-Women.\" So Heart-Killer went with them and lay down with them, as it was now night. But before they went to sleep the two women said, \"Look here, Heart-Killer, when the morning comes, at whosesoever head stands the birch-bark dish with quill work around it and filled with rice, she is the one who shall have Bead-Spitter for a husband.\" So when the morning came it was standing at the head of Heart-Killer, they say. Then they went on and came to a large lake, whose farther shores could not be seen. Out on the water was a large canoe. And as this was where Bead-Spitter's village was they called a,nd said, \" We have come to get Bead-Spitter for our husband.\" Some one came rowing. When he arrived, they said, \" We have come to make.Bead- Spitter our husband.\" To which he replied, \" I do not know any one by that name;\" but at the same time he filled his. mouth with beads, and then spat them out. The beads were scattered all around, and, laughing, they gathered them up. Then the two women went into the canoe, but the other they drove back, and said, \" Go away, Heart-Killer.\" So they went home with the man, but he was not Bead-Spitter. Heart-Killer stood there crying, when, lo! another canoe came in sight. It was a very bright and beautiful one, for it was all metal. It came on and arrived. This was the Bead-Spitter, and, as.he wore very bright clothing, the appearance was very splendid. \"Young woman, what are you crying for here1?\" he said. So she told him she had come to get Bead-Spitter for a husband and what the two women had done to her. Then he said, \"Come on, we two will go home.\" So she went home with him. Let us return to the others. The two women went home with the man whom they had met. His name was Teal-Duck, and he lived with his grandmother. By and by some one said, \"Teal- Duck, Bead-Spitter calls you to a feast.\" The Teal said, \"Indeed, somebody has said something;\" and then to the women he said, \"Do not come; they are making mystery; no woman looks at it.\" So he went. But the women said, \"We, too, areDAKOTA MYTHS. 149 accustomed to sec the supernatural; we will go,\" and so they went. When they reached the place there was much noise, and they came and looked in by a hole of the tent, and lo! the inmates were dancing on the back of Teal-Duck. He saw his wives peeping in, and jumping up, said, \" I, also, will join the dance on the Teal's back,\" and so he jumped about. They say this was the duck that is called the \"Teal,\" and hence, to this day, that duck has no fat on its back, because the people danced on it, they say. Then the two women started back, and, taking two blankets, they put bees in the one and ants in the other and went on. The other woman, who was called Heart- Killer, was with the Boy-Beloved. Her they took and thrust out, and then placed themselves on either side of him. Then Teal-Duck came home, and when he had lifted one blanket the bees came out and stung-him; when he lifted the other the ants came out and bit him. Then he said, \" Indeed, here is much that is strange,\" and so he opened out the blankets and the ants and bees swarmed out and drove everybody from the house. So he went and found the two wives of Teal-Duck with Bead-Spitter, to whom he said, \" My elder brother, give me back the younger one.\" There was no reply. Again he made the demand, but no answer came. And so Teal-Duck went home singing this song, they say: \" You Spitter of-Pearls, give me back my younger wife; For over the lake I always drive box-elder pegs.\" And from this has come down to us this form of speech, viz: When sores come out on people and pus is formed, they say, \"Teal-Duck has shot I hem.\" Now, when night came on, Sharp-Grass took his knife, and finding the Boy- Beloved sleeping with the two women, he cut off his head, and, holding it in his hand, took his station iuside of the tent. When the people knew that the Boy-Beloved lay headless there was a great tumult. So they went to the house of the Teal, but his grandmother had placed him on the top of his tent. They went in, but only a little brown heron came flying out. Hence the fowl that is called Little-Brown-Herou (snipe) is the grandmother of the Teal-Duck. It flew away and alighted in the corner of a reed marsh. Then the people went and trod down and trampled up thoroughly the reed island. Hence, when all the roots of the reeds are red, they say this is the blood of the Teal's grandmother. Then Teal-Duck, having the head of the Boy-Beloved, went and stood within the tent of the chief. And the mother of Boy-Beloved cried, and said, \" You bad, worthless fellow who debauched my child and had people dance upon your own back, you have impoverished me.\" While she cried, some one said, \"Indeed, and was it I .who did this thing?\" Then they called Uijktomi, and when his mother said, crying, \" Who is it who says this aloud, ' Indeed, and was it I who did it1?'\" Then Uijktomi said, \"Now, consider this: You say Uijktomi is a fool; why, don't you understand this1? It is he who stands within the tent who says this.\" Then they tore down the tent and beheld Teal-Duck holding the head of Boy- Beloved and the other having the knife, and they stood up high. \" Come down,\" they said, \"you shall live;\" but up they went and stood in the moon. And so now, when the moon is full, what appears in it is Teal-Duck holding the head of One- who-spits-out-pearls, and the other is Sharp-Grass holding the knife in his hands.

The introduction to the Dakota Grammar and Dictionary, published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1852, commences with this paragraph: The nation of Sioux Indians, or Dakotas, as they call themselves, is supposed to number about 25,0,00. They are scattered over an immense territory, extending from the Mississippi Eiver on the east to the Black Hills on the west, and from the mouth of the Big Sioux Eiver on the south to Devils Lake on the north. Early in the winter of 1837 they ceded to the United States all their land lying on the eastern side of the Mississippi; and this tract at present forms the settled portion of Minnesota. During the summer of 1851 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, with Governor Kainsey, of Minnesota, negotiated with the Dakotas of the Mississippi and Minnesota, or St. Peters Valley, for all their laud lying east of a line running from Otter-Tail Lake through. Lake Traverse (Lac Travers) to the junction of the Big Sioux Elver with the Missouri j the Indians retaining for their own settlements a reservation on the upper Minnesota 20 miles wide and about 140 long. This purchase includes all the wooded lands belonging to the Dakotas, and extends, especially on the south side of the Minnesota. Eiver, some distance into the almost boundless prairie of the West. Beyond this, the Indians follow the buffaloes, which, although evidently diminishing in numbers, still range in vast herds over the prairies. This animal furnishes the Indian with food and clothing, and a house, and, during the summer, with the \" bois de vache\" for fuel. In the winter these sous of the prairie are obliged to pitch their tents at or in tlie little clusters of wood, which here and there skirt the margins of the streams and lakes. t The interval of thirty years has made such changes in this people as to require an almost entirely new statement. First, as regards numbers: The above statement was made mainly by estimation, and not on actual count. Only a small portion of the Dakota were at that time receiving annuities. In this case the estimate was largely under the truth. Since that time, when the western Dakota were at war with our Government, they were variously estimated as numbering from 40,000 upward. But as 155156 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. they are now gathered at the various agencies, viz, Cheyenne River, Crow Creek, Devils Lake, Lower Brule, Pine Ridge, Rosebud, Sisseton, Stand\u00ad ing Rock, and Yankton, in Dakota Territory, with Poplar River in Mon\u00ad tana, and Santee in Nebraska, they are reported at a little less than 30,000. This does not include the more than 100 families of homesteaders at Flan- dreau and Brown Earth. Nor does it include Sitting Bull's party, the greater part of which has recently returned to the United States. In addi\u00ad tion to these, are, Dakota-speaking people beyond the line, the Stoneys, and Assiniboin, besides at least 1,000 of the refugees from our war of 1862, who have become permanent residents in the Queen's dominions. We now conclude that 40,000 will be a low estimate of those who speak the Dakota language. Secondly, as regards habitat: This will be made plain by a brief state\u00ad ment of the migrations and history of the different tribes which constitute the Dakota nation. TRIBES. Their name, the Dakota say, means leagued or allied; and they some\u00ad times speak of themselves as the \" Oceti sakowirj,\" Seven council fires, These are the seven principal bands which compose the tribe or nation, viz: 1. The Mdewakantorjwai), Village of the Spirit Lake. Their name is derived from a former residence at Mdewakarj (Spirit or Sacred Lake), Mille Lacs, which are in Minnesota, at the head of Ruin River. This was the old home of the nation, when Hennepin and Du Luth visited them two hundred years ago. As these so-called Spirit Lake villagers occupied the gateway of the nation, they were for a long time better known than the, other portions of the tribe, and came to regard themselves as living in the center of the world. Thirty years ago this record was made of them: They are divided into seven principal villages, three of which are still on the western bank of the Mississippi, and the others on or near the Minnesota, within 25 or 30 miles of Port Snelling. This portion of the Dakota people have received an\u00ad nuities since the year 1838, and their number, as now enrolled, is about 2,000. They plant corn and other vegetables, and some of them have made a little progress in civilization. In that same year of 1851 they sold their land to the Government and were removed to a reservation on the upper Minnesota, and were the principal actors in the emente of 1862, which resulted in their capture and dispersion. Those who fled to the Dominion of Canada with Little Crow have, for the most part, remained there, while those who lived through theDAKOTA TRIBES. 157 ordeal of captivity are now a civilized people at the Santee Agency, in Nebraska, and at the Flandreau Homestead Settlement on the Big Sioux. The origin of the name Mdewakarjtonwarj.is accounted for by Mr. M. Renville as follows: In the east country there was a large lake, and in the lake there was a Taku-Wakan, which was feared. But there they made their village. And when the planting time came this local god always made his appearance. But this gens dreamed of it and worshiped it, and no more feared it. Hence they got the name of \" Sacred-Lake Villagers.\" This was an original gens of the Dakota people, which was afterwards divided into seven gentes, viz: (1) Ki-yu-ksa, Breakers of custom or law, said to refer to marrying into their own gens. (2) He-mni-carj (Hay- minnee-chan), Hill-ioaier-wood, the name of Barn Bluff at Red Wing. (3) Ka-po-za (Kaposia), Liglit ones, those who traveled unincumbered with baggage. (4) Ma-ga-yu-te sni, They who do not eat geese. (5) He-ya-ta- tor)-we, The Back Villagers. This was the Lake Calhoim (6) Oyate- sica, 2. The Wahpekute, Leaf-shooters. It is not now known from what circumstances the Wahpekute received their name. Thirty years ago they were a roving band of about 500 or 600, who laid claim to the country of Cannon River, the head waters of the Blue Earth, and west\u00ad ward. They were guilty of the massacre of Spirit Lake, in Iowa, in 1857, and were so demoralized thereby that they became rovers, and have lost their place in the Dakota family. After the sale of their land, in 1851, they became connected with the Spirit-Lake band, and, disregarding their gentes, some of them are now at Santee Agency and some at Sisseton Agency, but the greater part have fled to the Missouri River and to Canada. 3. The Walipetorjwar), Village in the Leaves, probably obtained their name from the fact that formerly they lived only in the woods. The old home of this band was about the Little Rapids, which is some 45 miles by water from the mouth of the Minnesota River. * Thirty years ago it was written: About 300 still reside there, but the larger part of the band have removed to Lac-qni-parle and Big Stone Lake. In all they number about 1,000 or 1,200 souls. They all plant corn, more or less, and at Lac-qni-parle, one of the mission stations occupied by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, they have made some progress in learning to read and write their own language, and have substituted, to some extent, the use of the plow for the hoe. 1 Hake-waste, a chief of the Mdewakaijtoijwaij, who was in Washington, D. C., in 1880, gave the fifth and seventh gentes as \" Heyata otoijwe \" and \" Tiyta otoq we;\" but since then Rev. A. L. Riggs has given the forms \" Heyatatonwan \" and \"Tintatoijwaij.\" J. o. D.158 DAKOTA GRAMMAR. TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. These Dwellers in the Leaves were more or less mixed up in the out\u00ad break of 1862. Some of them fled to Manitoba, where they now have a native church near Fort Ellin. Some of them were of the captivity, and carried letters and religion into the prison, while some were prominent in bringing about a counter revolution and in delivering the white captives. They are now mixed with Sisseton on the Sissetoii and Devil's Lake Reser\u00ad vations and in the Brown Earth Homestead Settlement. Mr. M. RenviJle accounts for the origin of the name Leaf Villagers in this wise: \"First, tradition says the clan were in tlie habit of making booths with tree branches with the leaves attached. Secondly, when camping in a country of prairie and woods they were in the habit of making their camp in the wood. Hence their name. They were divided into three subgentes, viz: 1. Wah-pa-toij-wan. 1 2. Ta-ka- psin-tona. 3. Otehatoijnsi. They lived originally at Knife Lake, where there was a beautiful prairie. A part of the clan became famous ball players, and hence the name -of Takapsintona. Another part were afraid of enemies, and so, when on journeys, they sought a thicket in which to make their camp. Hence they were called Otelii- atonwe, Dwellers in Thickets.\" 4. The Si-si-torj-warj. Formerly we were told that si-sirj meant swampy land; and so we translated the name Swamp Villagers. But the evidence is in favor of another meaning and origin. M. Renville gives the following: At Traverse des Sioux, at the Blue Earth, and on the Big Cot- tonwood, they made their villages. They took many fish from the river and lakes. These they cut up and dried, throwing the scales and entrails in heaps, which appeared partly white and shining, and partly black and dirty. This appearance they called sirj-sirj. And hence when the young- men of other villages would go to see them they said, Let us go to the Sisiatorjwarj those who live on the sirjsirj. Hence the people were called Sisseton. They were divided thus into subgentes: The white people brought whiskey. The Sissetoiis got drunk and killed each other. By this means they were scattered. , Some went up to Lake Traverse, and some went to the Two Woods west of Lac-qui-parle. These last were called (1) Ti-zaptaima, Five Lodges. These were Thunder Face's people. Some were called (2) Okopeya. These were his brother's followers. A part of the gens remained at Traverse des Sioux 'The following is a full list of the geutes of the Walipetonwan, as obtained from their mis\u00ad sionary, Rev. Edward Ashley, in 1884: (1) Inyan ceyaka atonwai), Village at the Rapids ; (2) Takapsin toij wanna, Those who Dwell at 'Hie Shinny-ground; In-Log (huts?). When they camped with the Sisitonwaij, a different order of these gentes Avas observed, as will be explained hereafter. j. o. D.DAKOTA TRIBES. 159 and at Little Kock. These were called (3) Can-sda-ci-ka-na, Little place bare of wood.1 These were Sleepy Eyes' and Red Iron's people. Another portion was called (4) Amdo-wa-pus-kiya. They lived at Lake Traverse and were great buffalo hunters. They often moved camp when their meat was not dried, and so spread it out on the horses' backs and on the thills, and hence were called Dryers on the Shoulder. These were Standing Buf\u00ad falo's people. (5) Basdece sni. (6) Kapoza. (7) Ohdihe. Previous to 1862 they numbered about 3,000. But, being in\u00ad volved in the uprising of that year, they fled to the Missouri River and to Canada. Some have returned, and are at the Sisseton and Devil's Lake agencies. 2 These Mississippi and Minnesota Dakotas are called, by those on the Missouri, Isarj ties or Santies, from 'isarjati' or 'isarjyati;' which name seems to have been given them from the fact that they once lived at Isarjtamde, Knife Lake, one of those included under the denomination of Mille Lacs.3 1 Mr. Ashley says that these were Sleepy Eyes' division of the Kalimi atonwaij. J. 6. D. 2 The following are the gentes and subgentes of the Sisitonwan, as given by their mission\u00ad ary, Rev. Edw. Ashley, in 1884. Beginning at the north and to the right of the^ opening of the tribal circle the tents were pitched in the following order: 1. (ft) Wita waziyata otina, Dwellers at the'Northern Island. (6)'Ohdihe. 2. (a) Basdede sni, Those who do not split (the backbone of the buffalo). (6) Itokali-tina, Dwellers at the South. 3. (a) Kalimi atonwaij, Village at the Hend. Part of these were called Oaijs\"da oikana. (6) Mani-ti, Those ivho pitched their tents away from the main camp. (c) Keze, Barbed, as a fishhook; a name of ridicule. The Keze tents were on the right of the south end of the tribal circle. On the left of them came: 4. Oaijkute, Shooters at trees, another name given in derision. 5. (\u00ab) Ti-zaptaij, Five Lodges, (b) Okopeya, In danger. 6. Kap.oza, Those who travel with light burdens. 1. Amdowapuskiyapi, Those who place the meat on their shoulders in order to dry it. These were divided into three subgentes, Maka ideya, Wainudiupi duta, and Wa,qnidi nahotorj. When only a part of the tribe was together the following camping order was observed: The Wita waziyata otiua pitched their tents from the right side of the opening at the north and as far as the east; next, the Itokali-tina extended from the east to the south; the Kapoza occupied the area from tlie south to the west, and the Amdo-wapus-kiyapi filled the space between them and the Wita waziyata otina. When the Sisitonwaq aud Walipetonwarj camped together it was in tlie following order, begin\u00ad ning at the right side of the opening at the north: 1. Wita waziyata otina (including Caijkaga otina (on the right of the south part of the circle). 10. Keze (on the left of the south part of the.circle). 11. Kahini atorjwan. 12. Kapoza. 16. Amdo wapuskiyapi (on the left side of the opening at the north). J. o. D. 3 According to the context, we are led to make this last sentence of the author refer to four divisions of the Dakota: Mdewakaijtonwaij, Walipekute, Walipetonwaq, and Sisitonwai). But this is commented on in \"The Word Carrier\" for January, 1888, iii a criticism of Kirk's Illustrated History of Minnesota: \"One such\" error \" we find on page 33, where the Mdewakantonwaus are said to be one of the four bands of the Sautees. Instead of this, the Mdewakantouwans are the Santees. It is true that white men on the Missouri River and westward, with utter disregard of the facts, call all the Minne\u00ad sota Sioux 'Santees'; but a Minnesota writer should keep to the truth, if he knows it.\" This led the undersigned'to ask the editor of \" The Word Carrier,\" Rev. A. L. Riggs, the following questions (in April, 1888): (1) Why do you say that the Mdewakaqtorj wan are the (only) Santees ? (2) How do you interpret the statement made in the first edition of 'The Dakota Language/ p. viii ('These160 DAKOTA GBAMMAE, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. 5. The Ihanktonwan 1 or Yankton, Village at the End, were counted, thirty years ago, at about 240 lodges, or 2,400 persons. They are now reported at nearly that number by actual count. The outbreak did not disturb them and they continue to occupy their old home at the present Yankton Agency on the Missouri River, where they are making progress in civilization. This is the headquarters of Rev. J. P. Williamson's Presby\u00ad terian mission, and also of Bishop Hare's mission of the Episcopal Church. 6. The Iharjktonwanna, one of the End Village bands, were estimated at 400 lodges, or 4,000 souls. The Dakota tents on the Minnesota do not average more than about 6 inmates; but on the prairie, where, though the material for the manufacture of tents is abundant, tent-poles are scarce, they make their dwellings larger, and average, it is thought, about 10 per\u00ad sons to a lodge. The Iharjktorjwarjna are divided into the Hurjkpatina; 2 the Pabakse, Cut Heads; the Wazikute or Caijona, Pine Shooters;* and the Kiyuksa, Dividers or Breakers of Law. Formerly they were the owners of Mississippi find .Minnesota Dakotas are called by those on the Missouri, Isanties/ to which your i'ather added in 1882, 'or Santees') ? Who were these Mississippi and Minnesota Dakotas at the date mentioned (1852) if not the Mdewakantoqwarj, Walipekiite, Walipetonwarj, and Sisitorjwan 1? (3) Has there not been a change in the use of ' Santee' since 1852? (4) Are not all the Dakotas on the Santee reservation known as Santees, or were they not thns known from the time of their settlement on that reservation till they became citizens of the United States?\" To this Mr. Riggs replied as follows: \"The point I made with Prof. Kirk was this: That while there is a use of the name Saiitee in the Missouri River country to signify the Dakota Indians ox the Minnesota and Mississippi, and those removed from there, yet the original meaning was more specific and limited. And that it was inex- v disable in a Minnesota historian to have ignored the original and local signification of the term. This did not conflict in the least with the statement made by my father iu the Dakota Dictionary * * * The Mdewakau and Isantamde are one and the same, i. c., one of the Mille Lacs, from whence, as you know, came the names Mdewakantouwan and Isanyati. These Mdewakantonwau are the Santees of Santeo Agency, Nebraska, who were removed from Minnesota.\" Such testimony ought to be decisive; yet we find the father making the following statement (in 1882) in his \"Argument of Migrations (derived) from Names\" which will be found in the present volume: \"Santee. For a century or more past there have been included in this name the Leaf Shooters (Walipekute) and also the Leaf Village (Walipetorjwarj).\" ,T. o. D. 'The following names of the Yankton gentes were furnished by Heliaka mani, a Yankton, in 1878: 1. (3an-kute, Shooters at dagn, Lights, or, 3. oin, Ikmurj, si6a, Nation. 8.

Hence both these names Can-ona, Hitting the Wood, and Wazi-kute, Shooting the Pine. From this clan of Pine Shooters the Assimboin, or \"Hohe\" of the Dakota, are said to have sprung.DAKOTA TRIBE?. 161 the James River country. Now they are distributed in the villages along the Missouri, principally at Standing Rock.1 7. The Titonwan. In its present form this might mean House-dwellers. But it is understood to be a contracted form of Tin ta-ton wan, meaning Dwellers on tlie Prairie, or prairie villages. They constitute one-half or more of the whole Dakota nation. For many years they have followed the buffalo west of the Missouri River, and now they are mainly confined to the great Sioux Reserve in southwestern Dakota. Not a dozen years have passed since they began to take steps towards education and civilization. Hitherto the Episcopalians have done the most missionary work among them. Within two years past they have taken some interest in sending their children to Hampton and Carlisle to be educated. With the Shaiena Shahiyela, or Cheyennes, they have maintained friendly relations and intermarried. They are divided into seven principal tribes, viz: The Sicangu, or Brules, Burnt Thighs; the Itazipco, or Sans Arcs, No Bows, or Without Bows, as the word is understood to be contracted from Itazipa codarj; the Sihasapa, Black-feet; the Minikanye the Two Boilings or Two Kettles; the Oglala, or Ogalala, and the Hunkpapa. Each of these names has doubtless a history, which will be herewith given as far as we are able to trace it. Let us begin with the last: Hunkpapa: For a good many years we have been anxiously seeking to find out the meaning and origin of \"Hunkpapa,\" and its near neighbor \"Hurjkpatina\" they both being names of large families or clans among the litonwarj. But our investigations have hitherto been unsatisfactory. Sometimes it has seemed to us that they must be formed from \"Hurjka,\" which is an honorable name for the older male relatives, and for ancestors generally: as in \"Hunkake\" ancestors, and \"Hunkawanzi\" brothers, and \"Hunkayapi\" elders. The analysis would be reduced to its limit in \"Hun\" mother. \" Hunkpa\" would be Hurjka-pa meaning Family-Head; and Hunkpapa would be a reduplication, while Hunkpatina would mean Dwellers of Family Head. 1 In 1880, Nasnua taijka, Big Head, and Mato noijpa, Two Grizzly Bears, said that their people were divided into two parts, each having seven gentes. (I) Upper Iharjktoijwaijna includes the fol\u00ad lowing: 1. Can-ona, Those who Hit the Tree, ox, Wazi-knte, Shooters at the Pine. 2. Takini. 3. Siksi- cena, Small bad ones of different kinds. 4. Bakihon, Those who Gashed-Themselves. 5. Kiyuksa, Breakers of the Law or Cuslom. 6. Pa-baksa, Cut Heads (divided into sub-gentes). 7. Name not remembered. (II) Huijkpatina, or Lower Iharjkfcoi) wanna, includes the following: 1. Pute temiui (sic), Sweating Upper-Lips. 2. Sun. ikceka, Common Dogs (f). 3. Taliuha yuta, Eaters of the Scrapings of Skins. 4. Sanona, Those Who Hit Something White or Gray (in the distance). These are called the Sarjouee (One Siders?) by the author. 5. Iha \u00a3a, Red Lips. 6. Ite gu, Burnt Faces. 1. Pte yute sui, Eat no Buffalo. The Ihaijktoijwanna are generally called Yanktonai. J. o. D. 7105 VOL ix 11162 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, A^D ETHNOGRAPHY. Then again we have endeavored to derive the words in question, from He-irjkpa or He-oiqkpa, which would give two meanings, Horn-end or Thai- end. In this case we have supposed the names might have originated from their dwelling on the upper or smaller part of the Missouri River. But as I said, neither of these have been quite satisfactory. Some other attempted explanations by Indians have been still less so. But the other day, Paul Mazakatemani, who is largely acquainted with the habits and customs of the prairie Indians as well as the more eastern bands, gave what seems to be a very natural account of the origin of both the words. From time immemorial it has been the custom of the prairie Dakota to travel under strict camp regulations. The tribes of the children of Israel in the wilderness did not set forward with more formality, and camp with more precision. The \"Tiyotipi\"or Soldier's Lodge took the place of the Ark of the covenent. Under this leadership each band and each family took its appointed place in the encampment. In two lines they followed the lead of young men on horseback until the circle was completed. At the farther end of the circle a space was left in which was pitched the Tiyotipi. More commonly on the prairie this soldiers' tent was in the center of the area. The ends of this gateway, which would be well repre\u00ad sented by the horns of a buffalo cow turning inwards, were called \"Hurjkpa,\" evidently from He-oiykpa. The families camping on either side of this gateway were called Huwkpa-tina: whence the name came to be at\u00ad tached to a clan of the Iharjktorjwarjna. The added \"pa\" in Hurjkpapa is probably only a reduplication. 1 This is decidedly the best and most satis\u00ad factory explanation of this difficult question in philology, that has come to my knowledge. Oglala finds its corresponding term in Santee, in Ohdada, which means to scatter one's own in; and is understood to have originated in boys throw\u00ad ing sand in each others' eyes. The following important information is furnished by Rev. J. Owen Dorsey: In 1879 I received a letter from the Rev. John Robinson, missionary to the Oglala at Eed Cloud Agency, giving the origin of the names Huijkpapa, Oglala, etc., as told him by the Indians at that place: \" Hunkpapa, those who camp at the head end of the (Dakota) circle; Htinkpati, those who camp at the tail end of that circle. This latter probably includes both 1 If there were a reduplication in this word, would not the form be \"Hun-kpa-kpa,\" instead of Hun-kpa-pa? The final \"pa\" may be compared with the adverbial ending \" wapa \" in akowapa, etc., the locative the wa\" J. (Yankton),or l End Village People/ and Ihagktonwaijna (Yanktonnais), or ' People of the Smaller End Village.' \" Oglala originated in a quarrel between two women. One threw some flour (?) in the face of the other, thus giving rise to the name, which means i She scattered her own.' The adherents of the injured Avoinan separated from the rest, and since then their people have been called the Oglala.\" The Oglala are called i U-b$a'-<\u00a3a' by the Ponka and Omaha tribes.

(8) The Assiniboin: The majority of this tribe live north of the forty- ninth parallel, but some of them are mixed in with the Dakota proper at Poplar River and elsewhere. That they branched off from the Yanktonai some two centuries ago, is one of the traditions of the Dakota. They speak the language as purely as other portions of the parent stock. The name Assiniboin is said to be a combination of French and Ojibwa. The name given to the Dakota by their former enemies is \" Bwarj.\" Hence the Assiniboin are Stone Dakota. The Dakota name for them is \"Hohe,\" the origin and meaning of which we have hitherto failed to find out.1 PRIORITY. Questions of priority and precedence among these bauds are sometimes discussed. The Mdewakarjtorjwarj think that the mouth of the Minnesota River is precisely over the center of the earth, and that they occupy the gate that opens into the western world. These considerations serve to give them importance in their own estimation. On the other hand; the Sisitonwarj and Ihanktorjwarj allege, that as they live 011 the great water-shed of this part of the continent, from which the streams run northward and eastward and southward and westward, they must be about the center of the earth; and they urge this fact as entitling them to the precedence. It is singular that the Titonwarj, who are much the largest band of the Dakota, do not appear to claim the chief place for themselves, but yield to the pretensions of the Iharjktorjwar), whom they call by the name of Wiciyela, which, in its meaning, may be regarded as about equivalent to \"they are the people.\" METHOD OF COUNTING. Counting is usually done by means of their fingers. If you ask some Dakota how many there are of anything, instead of directing their answer to your organs of hearing, they present it to your sight, by holding up so many fingers. When they have gone over the fingers and thumbs of both hands, one is temporarily turned down for one ten. Eleven is ten more one, or more commonly again one; twelve is again ttvo, and so on; nineteen is the 'According to Dr. J. Truinbnll, the name Assitiiboiu is derived from two Ojibwa words, \"asiijni,\" stone, and \"bwaq,\" enemy. Some of the Sihasapa Dakota are called Hohe. J. o. r>.METHOD OF BECKONING TIME. 165 other nine. At the end of the next ten another finger is turned down, and so on. Twenty is two tens, thirty is three tens, etc., as will be seen by refer\u00ad ring to the section on Numeral Adjectives in the Grammar. Opawrrjge, one hundred, is probably derived from pawrrjga, to go round in circles or to make gyrations, as the fingers have been all gone over again for their respective tens. The Dakota word for a thousand, kektopawirjge, may be formed of 'ake' and 'opawirjge,' hundreds again, having now completed the circle of their fingers in hundreds, arid being about to commence again. They have no separate word to denote any higher number than a thousand. There is a word to designate one-half of anything, but none to denote any smaller aliquot part. METHOD OF RECKONING TIME. The Dakota have names for the natural divisions of time. Their years they ordinarily count by winters. A man is so many winters old, or so many winters have passed since such an event. When one is going on a journey, he does not usually say that he will be back in so many days, as we do, but in so many nights or sleeps: In the same way they compute distance by the number of nights passed in making the journey. They have no division of time into weeks.. Their months are literally moons. The popular belief is that when the moon is full, a great number of very small mice commence nibbling on one side of it, which they continue to do until they have eaten it all up. Soon after this another moon begins to grow, which goes 011 increasing until it has reached its full size only to share the fate of its .predecessor; so that with them the new moon is really new, and not the old one reappearing. To the moons they have given names, which refer to some prominent physical fact that occurs about that time in the year. For the names of the moons most commonly used by the Dakotas living in the Valley of the Minnesota, with their significations and the months to which they most nearly correspond, the reader is referred to the word \"wi,\" Part I of the Dictionary. Five moons are usually counted to the winter, and five to the summer, leaving only one each to the spring and autumn; but this distinction is not closely adhered to. The Dakotas often have very warm debates, especially towards the close of the winter, about what moon it is. The raccoons do not always make their appearance at the same time every winter; and the causes which produce sore eyes are not developed precisely at the same time in each successive spring. All these variations make room for strong166 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAHY. arguments in a Dakota tent for or against Wicata-wi or Istawicayazan-wi. But the main reason for their frequent difference of opinion in regard to this matter, viz., that twelve lunations do not bring them to the point from which they commenced counting, never appears to have suggested itself. In order to make their moons correspond with the seasons, they are obliged to pass over one every few years. SACRED LANGUAGE. The Dakota conjurer, the war prophet, and the dreamer, experience the same need that is felt by more elaborate performers among other nations of a language which is unintelligible to the common people, for the purpose of impressing upon them the idea of their superiority. Their dreams, according to their own account, are revelations made from the spirit-world, and their prophetic visions are what they saw and knew in a former state of existence. It is, then, only natural that their dreams and visions should be clothed in words, many of which the multitude do not un\u00ad derstand. This sacred language is not very extensive, since the use of a few unintelligible words suffices to make a whole speech incomprehensible. It may be said to consist, first, in employing words as the names of thing which seem to have been introduced from other Indian languages; as, nide, water; paza, ^vood, etc. In the second place, it consists in employing de\u00ad scriptive expressions, instead of the ordinary names of things; as in calling a man a biped, and the wolf a quadruped. And thirdly, words which are common in the language are used far out of their ordinary signification; as, hepan, the second child, if a boy, is used to designate the otter. When the Dakota braves ask a white man for an ox Or cow, they generally call it a dog; and when a sachem begs a horse from a white chief, he does it under the designation of moccasins. This is the source of many of the figures of speech in Indian oratory; but they are sometimes too obscure to be beauti\u00ad ful. ARE THE INDIANS DIMINISHING? One view of the question, and that hitherto the most common one, considers that North America had a dense population before the coming of the white race, and that since the Indians have been brought in contact with the advance guard of civilization they have been diminishing, many tribes having disappeared. But another view is gaining ground among students of the Indian. It is now maintained that, in spite of wars, dis\u00ad eases, exposures, and migrations, there are nearly as many Indians to-dayARE THE INDIANS DIMINISHING? 167 in the United States as there were in the same territory in 1520, when the Spaniards met the Indians of Florida. While it must be conceded, as a matter of history, that some tribes and bands which once inhabited the country occupied by the people of these United States have greatly diminished, and a few have disappeared alto\u00ad gether, other tribes have been on the increase. War and \"spirit water,\" and the diseases introduced among them by the white people, have wrought out their legitimate effects. A different course of treatment would un\u00ad doubtedly have greatly modified or entirely changed the character of these results. But there is one way in which a diminution of some tribes is taking place, viz, by ceasing to be Indians and becoming members of civilized society. In Minnesota all persons of mixed blood, i. e., of white and Indian descent, are recognized as citizens. The same is true in other States; and the privilege is extended to those who are not mixed bloods. Also, under present homestead laws, Indians are becoming citizens by going off their reserves. Let a well-arranged severalty bill be enacted into a law, and Indians be guaranteed civil rights as other men, and they will soon cease to be Indians. The Indian tribes of our continent may become extinct as such; but if this extinction is brought about by introducing them to civilization and Christianity and merging them into our own great nation, which is receiving accretions from all others, who will deplore the result ? Rather let us labor for it, realizing that if by our efforts they cease to be Indians and become fellow-citizens it will he our glory and joy.CHAPTER II. MIGRATIONS OF THE DAKOTA. Of the aboriginal tribes inhabiting this country, George Bancroft, in his History of the United States, has assigned the first place, in point of numbers, to the Algonquin family, and the second place to the Dakota. Those who have made a study of the ethnology and the languages of the races have almost uniformly come to the conclusion that the Indians of this continent are connected with the Mongolian races of Asia. The line across from Asia to America by Bering Straits is regarded as perfectly practicable for canoes. And in 10 degrees farther south, by the Aleutian Islands, the distances are not so great but that small boats might easily pass from one to the other, and so safely reach the mainland. Lewis H. Morgan, of the State of New York, who has given much time and study to solving the question, \" Whence came the Indians'?\" has adopted this theory, and makes them gather on the Columbia River, from whence they have crossed the Rocky Mountains and spread over these eastern lands. But it can. be safely affirmed that, up to this time, ethnology and the com\u00ad parative study of languages have not quite satisfactorily settled the ques\u00ad tion of their origin. In discussing the question of the migrations of the Dakota or Sioux, there are two lines open to us, each entirely independent, and yet both telling the same story: First, the history, as written in books; second^ the history, as found in names. AEOUMEIs TT FKOM HISTOEY. The book history runs back nearly two and a half centuries. The first knowledge of the Dakota nation obtained by the civilized world came through the French traders and missionaries, and was carried along the line of the Great Lakes through New France. Early in the seventeenth century, a young man of more than ordinary ability, by name Jean Nicolet, came from France to Canada. He had great aptness in acquiring Indian languages, and soon became Algonquin and 168MIGRATIONS ARGUMENT FROM HISTORY 1 69 Huron interpreter for the colony of New France. In the year 1639 he visited the lake of the Wimiebagos, or Green Bay, in the present state of Wisconsin, and concluded a friendly alliance with the Indians on Fox River. In the next year, Paul le Jeune, writing of the tribes who dwelt on Lake Michigan, says, \" Still farther on dwell the Ouinipegoii, who are very numerous.\" And, \"In the neighborhood of this nation are the Naduessi and the Assimpoiiais.\" This appears to be the first mention made by voyagers of the Dakota and Assiniboin. Le Jeune's information was obtained from Nicolet, who claimed to have visited them in their own coun\u00ad tries. In 1641, at the Sault Ste. Marie, Jogues and Raymbault, of the \"Society of Jesus,\" met Pottowattomies flying from the Dakota, and were told that the latter lived \"about eighteen days' journey to the westward, nine across the lake, and nine up a river which leads inland.\" Two adventurous Frenchmen, in 1654, went to seek their fortunes in the region west of Lake Michigan, and returning to Quebec two years afterwards, related their adventures among \"the numerous villages of the Sioux.\" And in 1659, it is related that the two traders, as they traveled six days journey southwest from La Pointe in Lake Superior, came upon a Huron village on the shores of the Mississippi. These Hurons had fled from a fierce onslaught of the Iroquois, and for the time had taken refuge among the Dakota. In the vicinity of the Huron they saw the Dakota villages, \"in five of which were counted all of 5,000 men.\" From the beginning of the intercourse of white men with Indians on this continent the fur trade has been the chief stimulus to adventure and the great means by which the location and condition of the aboriginal pop\u00ad ulations were made known to the civilized world. Two other subsidiary motives operated to bring white men into connection with the great Dakota nation, viz, the desire to discover the great river on which they were said to dwell, and the zeal of the church of Rome to convert the savages. In the summer of 1660 Rene Meiiard, the aged, burning with an apostolic desire to make converts from among the pagans, bore the standard of the cross to the shores of Lake Superior. At La Pointe, which was already a trading port, he wintered. But in the following spring he started on foot with a guide to visit \"four populous nations\" to the westward. By some means he became separated from his guide while passing through the marshes of northwestern Wisconsin and was lost. Many years after\u00ad wards a report was current in Canada that \"his robe and prayer-book were found in a Dakota lodge,\" and were regarded as \"wakan\" or sacred.170 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. The successor of Menard in the toils of missionary life was Father Claude Allouez. He established the mission of the Holy Spirit at La Poiute and the Apostles' Islands in the year 1665, and four years later he com\u00ad menced a mission among the Wiunebago and others on Green Bay. On reaching La Pointe, Allouez found the Huron and Ojibwa villages in a state of great excitement. The Huron, who had fled to the Dakota of the -Mississippi for protection from the tomahawk of the Iroquois some years before, had behaved ungraciously toward their protectors by taunting them with having no guns; whereupon the Dakota rose against them, massa\u00ad cred many of them in a swamp, and drove them all back to the shores of Lake Superior. The Ojibwa had formerly lived to the east of Lake Michigan, but had been driven westward by the victorious Iroquois. Now -tfee Dakota, the Iroquois of the West, as they have been called, had shut them up to the lake shore. The young men were burning to be avenged on the Dakota. Here was gathered a grand council of the neighboring nations the Huron, the Ojibwa, the Pottowattomi, the Sac and Fox, the Menomoni, and the Illinois. Allouez commanded peace, in the name of the King of the French, and offered them commerce and alliance against the Five Nations. In 1667 Father Allouez met a delegation of Dakota and Assiniboin at the western end of Lake Superior, near where is now the town of Duluth. They had come, they said, from the end of the earth. He calls them \"the wild and impassioned Sioux.\" \"Above all others,\" he says, \"they are sav\u00ad age and warlike; and they speak a language entirely unknown to us, and the savages about here do not understand them.\" But Allouez resolved to abandon his work at La Pointe, \"weary of their obstinate unbelief,\" and was succeeded by the renowned Jacques Marquette. This enterprising and estimable man entered at once upon the work of perpetuating peace among the various tribes, and, in the autumn of 1669, sent presents and a message to the Dakota, that he wished them to keep a way open for him to the Great River and to the Assiniboin beyond. But not from the mission of the Holy Spirit was he to take his journey to the \"Father of Waters.\" In the following winter it became apparent that the Huron were not safe on the -southern shores of Lake Superior, and accordingly they abandoned their village, and at the same time Marquette retired to the Sault Ste. Marie, from which point, in the spring of 1672, he proceeded, with Louis Joliet, to find the Great River, the \"Messipi.\" 1 They 1 Probably iii the language of the Illinois Indians, \"messi,\" great, and \"sepi,\" river.MIGRATIONS ARGUMENT FROM HISTORY. 171 proceeded by way of Green Bay. They entered the mouth of Fox River, followed up its windings, and were guided by Indians across to the head of the Wisconsin, which they descended to the mouth, and down the great river to the mouth of the Arkansas. They had wintered at Green Bay, and so it was the 17th of June, 1673, when their canoe first rode on the waters of the Mississippi. On their return they ascended the Illinois River, stopped to recruit at the famous Illinois village, and, crossing over to Lake Michi\u00ad gan, reached Green Buy in the latter end of September. 1 The Jesuit relations of this period have much to say about the habits of the Dakota; that about 60 leagues irom the upper end of Lake Superior, toward sunset, \" there are a certain people, trailed JSFadouessi, dreaded by their neighbors.\" They only use the bow and arrow, but use them with great skill and dexterity, filling the air in a moment. \" They turn their heads in flight and discharge their arrows so rapidly that they are no less to be feared in their retreat than in their attack. They dwell around the great river Messipi. Their cabins are not covered with bark, but with skins, well dried, and stitched together so well that the cold does not enter. They know not how to cultivate the earth by seeding it, con\u00ad tenting themselves with a species of marsh rye (wild rice), which we call wild oats.\" We now come to more definite information in regard to country occu\u00ad pied by the Dakota two hundred years ago. Du Luth and Hennepin approached the Dakota by different routes, and finally met each other at the great villages on Mille Lacs, and Knife Lake, at the head of Run River. Daniel Greysolon Du Luth, who built the first trading port on Lake Superior, uon the first of September, 1678, left Quebec \"to explore the country of the Dakota and the Assiriiboin. On July 2, 1679, he caused the King's arms to be planted \"in the great village of the Nadouessioux, called Kathio, where no Frenchman had ever been, and also at Songaski- cons and Houetbetons, 120 leagues from the former.\"2 In September of that year Du Luth held a council with Assiniboin and other nations, who came to the head of Lake Superior. And in the summer of 1680 he made another trip down to the Mississippi, where he met with Hennepin. 1 Greeii Bay was called the Bay of the Puants, or Winnebago. In. this neighborhood there were, at that time, the Winnebago, the Pofctowattorni, the Menouioui, the Sac and Fox, the Miami, the Mas\u00ad contin, the Kickapoo, and others. The Miami and Mascontin lived together and had their village on the Neenah or Fox River. The Miami afterwards removed to the St. Joseph River, near Lake Michi\u00ad gan. The Mascontin, or \"Fire Nation,\" is now extinct. It is stated, on what appears to be good authority, that Du Liith this summer visited Mille Lac, which he called Lake Buade.172 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AJfD ETHNOGRAPHY. When Du Luth was fitting out his expedition by Lake Superior to the Dakota Nation and others, Robert La Salle was preparing to go to the great river of the West by the south end of Lake Michigan. 1 Louis Hemiepin, a Franciscan priest of the Recollect order, accompanied him. La Salle stopped to build a ship on Lake Erie, which he called the Griffin. This so detained his expedition that it was late in the fall of 1679 when they reached Green Bay. There the Griffin was left for the winter, and La Salle and Hennepin, with others, proceeded in canoes to the south end of the lake (Michigan), and thence by portage into the Illinois River. In the beginning of the year 16*0, La Salle, after enduring incredible hardships, built a fort a little below where is now the town of Peoria, which he called \" OeVe Goeur,\" thus making his heart troubles historical. In the month of February, La Salle selected Hemiepiii and two voy- ageurs named Michol Accau and the Picard du Gay, whose real name was Antoine Auguel, to undertake the discovery of the Upper Mississippi. On the last day of the month they embarked in a canoe ladeii with merchan\u00ad dise, and the venerable Ribourde took leave of Hemiepin with the charge, \" Viriliter age et confortetur cor tuum.\" On March 12 Hennepin and his companions turned their canoe up the stream of the Great River, and on April 11 they met a war party of 120 Dakota in thirty-three bark canoes. This meeting took place near the mouth of the Wisconsin, where Marquette had first seen the Mississippi, nearly seven years before. The Frenchmen had found wild turkeys abundant 011 their voyage, and were at this moment 011 the shore cooking their dinner. The Dakota approached with hostile demonstrations, and some of the old warriors repeated the name \"Miamiha,\" giving the white men to understand that they were on the warpath against the Miami and Illinois. But Hemiepiii explained to them, by signs and marks 011 the sand; that these Indians were now across the Mississippi, beyond their reach. The white men were the prisoners of the war party. What should be done with them? Not without much debate, did they decide to abandon the warpath and return home. Then, by signs, they gave the white men to understand that it was determined to kill them. This was the policy and the counsel of the old war chief, \"Again-fills-the-pipe\" by name, (Akepagidan), because he was mourning the loss of a son killed by the Miami. Hennepin and his companions endeavored to obtain the mercy of their captors by giving them a large amount of presents. They spent an anxious night But the next morning, better counsels prevailed, and a 1 The great village which he calls \" Kathio\" must have been in that region.MIGRATIONS ARGUMENT FROM HISTORY. 173 younger chief, Avhose name was \"Four Souls\" (Nagi-topa), filled his pipe with willow bark and smoked with them. And then made them under\u00ad stand that, as the war against the Miami was abandoned, and they would now go back to their villages, the white men should accompany them. This voyage up the Mississippi was not without continued apprehen\u00ad sion of danger to the Frenchmen. When Heimepin opened his breviary in the morning, and began to mutter his prayers, his savage captors gath\u00ad ered about him in superstitious terror, and gave him to understand that his book was a \"bad spirit\" (Wakarj sica), and that he must not converse with it. His comrades besought him to dispense with his devotions, or at least to pray apart, as they were all in danger of being tomahawked. He tried to say his prayers in. the woods, but the Indians followed him everywhere, and said \"Wakarj ci,\" Is it not mysterious 1? He could not dispense with saying his office. But finally he chanted the Litany of the Virgin in their hearing, which charmed the evil spirit from them. But the old chief, Again-fills-the-pipe, was still apparently bent on killing a white man to revenge the blood of his son. Every day or two he broke forth in a fresh fit of crying, which was accompanied with hostile demonstrations towards the captives. This was met by additional presents and the interceding of their first friend, Four Souls, in their behalf. It looks very much like a species of blackmailing a device practiced by them by which the goods of the white men should come into their posses\u00ad sion without stealing. They were also required to bring goods to cover some bones, which old Akepagidarj had with him, and over which they cried and smoked frequently. At Lake Pepin they cried all night, and from that circumstance, Hennepin called it the \"Lake of Tears.\" Thus they made their way up the Father of Waters where no white man had ever traveled before. Nineteen days after their capture they landed a short distance below where the city of St. Paul stands. Then the savages hid their own canoes in the bushes and broke the Frenchmen's canoe into pieces. From this point they had a land travel of five days, of suffering'and starvation to the white men, when they reached the Dakota villages at Mille Lacs, which was then the home of the Mdewakautons. O ' Hennepin estimated the distance they \"traveled by land at sixty leagues. But it was probably not over one hundred miles. They passed through the marshes at the head of Rum River, and were then taken by canoes \"a short league\" to an island in the lake, where were the lodges.174 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. This lake the Dakota called \"Mdewakan,\" mysterious lake, from which came the name of this branch of the Dakota family, Mde-wakarj-torjwarj. They also called it \"Isarj-ta-mde,\" Knife Lake, because there they found their stone knives and arrowheads. From this came the name \"Santee,\" which covers a much larger part of the tribe. (See footnote 3, pp. 159, 160.) Thus, in Pere Louis Hennepiii's narrative, we have the first exact, locality of the eastern hands of the Dakota people, two hundred years ago. The principal chief, at that time/ of this part of the tribe, is called by Hennepin. \"Washechoonde.\" If he is correct, their name for Frenchmen was in use, among the Dakota, before they had intercourse witli them, and was probably a name learned from some Indians farther east. The three white men, with their effects, were divided up among the various villages. And, strange to say, Hennepin was taken home by the old savage who had so much wished to kill him on the journey. He had now be\u00ad come his friend, even his father; his five wives became Hennepiii's mothers. They treated him kindly covered him with a robe made of dressed beaver skins, ornamented with porcupine quills, rubbed him down after his jour\u00ad ney, and set before him a bark dish full of fish. As the Franciscan fell sick, his savage father made a sweating-cabin, for him, and after the process of sweating naked by means of heated stones, he was rubbed down by four Indians. Thus he was reinvigorated. As no mention is made by either Hennepin or the historian of Du Luth of any planting at these villages, we may be quite sure that they did not plant, but lived by hunting and fishing mainly, which was supplemented by gathering roots and berries and wild rice. During the stay of the white men there came four Indians from the far west Hennepin says, \"500 leagues\" who reported the Assiniboin villages as only six or seven days' journey to the northwest. This would place this branch of the Dakota people, at that time, within the present limits of Minnesota, somewhere east of the Red River. In the month of July the whole encampment of Dakota, numbering 250 men, with women and children, started on a buffalo hunt. The French\u00ad men were to go with them. But Hennepin, anxious to make his escape, represented that a'party of traders, \"spirits\" or \" wakaii men,\" were to be sent by La Salle to the mouth of t'he Wisconsin, and he wished to meet them there. The Indians gave them leave to go, but Accau, who disliked Hennepin, preferred to stay among the savages. They all camped together on the banks of the Mississippi, at the mouth of Rum River, from, which point Hennepin and. Du Gay descended the greatMIGRATIONS AEGUMENT FBOM HISTOEY. 175 river in a small birch-bark canoe. At the falls, which Hennepin named St. Anthony, for his patron saint, they made a portage and saw half a dozen Dakotas, who had preceded them, offering buffalo-robes in sacrifice to Urjktehi, the great water god. As they paddled leisurely down the stream by the beautiful bluffs in this month of July, now and then shooting a wild turkey or a deer, they were suddenly overtaken by Hennepin's Dakota father, the old savage Akepagidarj, with 10 warriors in a canoe. The white men were somewhat alarmed, for he told them he was going down to the mouth of the Wisconsin to meet the traders, who were to be there according to the words of the Franciscan. They passed on rapidly, found no one at the place named, and, in a few days, they met them on their return, when the savage father only gave his son Hennepin a good scolding for lying. They were then near the mouth of the Chippewa River, a short dis\u00ad tance up which a large party of those with whom they had started were chasing buffalo. This information was given to the white men by the Indians as they passed up. Hennepin and Du Gray had but little ammuni\u00ad tion, and for this reason they determined to turn aside and join the buffalo hunt. In this party they found their former comrade. A grand hunt was made -along the borders of the Mississippi. The Dakota hunters chased the buffalo on foot and killed them with their flint-headed arrows. At this time they had neither guns nor horses. When they first saw the white men shoot and kill with, a gun they called it \" maza-wakar),\" mysterious iron. And, in after years, when the horse came to their knowledge they called it \" shurjka wakarj,\" mysterious dog. While they were thus killing the buffalo and drying the meat in the sun there came two Dakota women into camp with the news that a Dakota war party, on its way to Lake Superior, had met five \" spirits \" washe- chooi).1 These proved to be Daniel Greysoloii Du Luth with four well-armed Frenchmen. In June they had started from Lake Superior, had probably ascended the Burnt Wood River, and from that made a portage to the St. Croix, where they met this war party and learned that three white men were on the Mississippi. As this wTas Du Luth's preempted trading country, he was anxious to know who the interlopers were, and at once started for the hunting camp. We can imagine this to have been a joyful meeting of Frenchmen. The hunt was now over. The Indians, laden with dried meat and accompanied by the eight white men, returned to their resting place at Knife 1 Wasicuy.176 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. Lake. And when the autumn came the white men were permitted to leave, with the promise that in the following year they would return with goods to trade for the abundant peltries. They descended the Mississippi in bark canoes. At the Falls of St. Anthony two of the men took each a buffalo- robe that had been sacrificed to the god of the waters. Du Luth greatly disapproved of the act as both impolitic and wrong, but Hennepin justified it, saying they were offerings to a false god. As the white men were about to start up the Wisconsin River they were overtaken by a party of Dakota, again on the war-path against the Illinois. The white men, remembering the stolen robes, were alarmed, but the Dakota passed on and did them no harm.1 These Nadouessioux, or Sioux, of the east of the Mississippi, whose acquaintance we have now formed somewhat, appear at this time to have been divided into Matanton, Watpaaton, and Chankasketon. These are band names. But the headquarters of all was the Mde-wakarj or Isarj-ta- mde. From this point they issued forth on their hunting expeditions and their war parties. The latter penetrated into Iowa and central Illinois to Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. Sometimes we find them at peace with the Ojibwa and at war with the Fox. Then, again, we find the Fox and loway joining the Dakota war parties against the Ojibwa. The war which separated the Assiriiboin. from the Dakota had not ceased at this period, and the impression is that the separation had taken place not many years before they became known to history. Nicholas Perrot was sent by the governor of Canada, in 1683, to take charge of the trading interests among the loway and Dakota. And in 1689 the first recorded public document was signed in which the land of the Dakota was claimed for the French king. In this document Father Marest, of the Society of Jesus,,is spoken of as missionary among the Nadouessioux, and Mons. Le Sueur, to whom we are indebted for the next ten years of history, was present. .. Le Sueur was first sent to La Pointe to maintain peace between the Ojibwa and Dakota. And in the year 1695 he erected a trading post on an island of the Mississippi, above Lake Pepin and below the mouth of St. Croix. In the summer of the same year he took to Montreal delegations from several western tribes, including one Dakota, \"Teeoskatay\" 2by name. This man died in Montreal, and one hundred and fifty years afterward the 1 Le Clercq, the historian of the Sieur Du Luth, corroborates the story of Henuepin in regard, to their meeting at Knife Lake. 2Tioskate.MIGRATIONS ARGUMENT FROM.HISTORY. 177 writer of this sketch heard him spoken of by those who claimed to be his descendants, then on. the Minnesota River. Becoming impressed with the idea that there were valuable mines in the land of the Dakota, Le Sueur obtained a royal license to work them. He was hindered in various ways, and not until the summer of 1700 do we find him ascending 1 the Mississippi. On the 30th of July he met a Avar party of Dakota in seven canoes, who were on the warpath against the Illinois. Le Sueur bought them off with presents and turned them back home. Ad\u00ad vancing up as far as the Galena River he called it the River Mino. On the 19tli of September he entered the mouth of the Minnesota, or as he proba\u00ad bly named it then, and long afterwards it continued to be called, the \"St. Pierre.\" And by the 1st of October lie had reached the Blue Earth River, where he built a trading post and expected to make his fortune out of the lilue earth of its shores. While Le Sueur was building his stockade on the Blue Earth he was visited by Dakota from, the east of the Mississippi, who desired him to locate at the mouth of the St. Peter or Minnesota, since the country of the Blue Earth, they said, belonged to the western Dakota and to the Iowa and Oto. However, a short time after this Le Sueur was informed that the Iowa and Oto had gone over to the Missouri River to join the Omaha. At this time it is recorded that the Iowa and Oto planted corn, but the Dakota did not. Le Sueur offered to furnish corn to the latter for planting. At the beginning of the eighteenth century we have the Dakota nation, so far as known, described by bands., Some of the names it is now impossible to read with certainty. Some have disappeared or given place to others, while some of them are old landmarks by which we can read the history of their migrations. Living at that time1 to the east of the Missis\u00ad sippi, whose headquarters were about Knife Lake, were the Spirit Lake Village (Mdewakarjtorjwar)), Great Lake Village (Matanton perhaps origi\u00ad nally Mdetarjk-torjwarj), Wild Rice Gatherers (Psirj-omani-torjwarj), River Village (Watpatorjwar)), Boat Village (Watomanitoriwar)), Fortified Village (Cankaskato]}waij). The Western Dakota are thus given, Adz: Pole Village (Canhuasinton?), Red Wild Rice Village (PsirjcatorjAvan), Small Band Vil\u00ad lage (Wagalespeton 1?), Great Wild Rice Village (Pshjhutarjkiij-tonAvar)), Grand Village (Titaijka-kaga-toij ?), Leaf Village (Wahpetorjwaii), \"Dung Village (Urjkcekce-ota-tor)Avar)), Teton Leaf Village (Wahpeton- Teton), and Red Stone Quarry Village (Hinhaneton). This last must be the Red Pipe Stone, and the Dakota Avho guarded it Avere doubtless the 7105 VOL ix 12178 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. Yankton. 1 It is possible that the \"Red Stone\" may have signified the Des Moines River, which was so called. These bands were all at that time within the present State of Minne\u00ad sota, and mainly having their homes north of the forty-fifth parallel, except the last, who are said to have been living at the Red Stone Quarry. This can be no other than the Red Pipe Stone in the neighborhood of the Big Sioux. Le Sueur says the Assiniboiii lived on the head waters of the Mis\u00ad sissippi. For the next fifty years the Dakota appear to have kept within their old limits, sometimes at war with the Ojibwa, and then again in league with them, against the Fox and Sank. Already the quarrel between the English colonies and the French had commenced. The Fox took the side of the English, but were defeated at the port of Detroit and elsewhere, and obliged to flee for protection to their enemies, the Dakota. For a while it appears that the Fox hunted north of the Minnesota River. The maps made in France about 1750 locate the Dakota, as we have already seen, partly on the east and partly on the west side of the Missis\u00ad sippi. They occupied Leech Lake, Sandy Lake, and probably Red Lake at that time and for some years afterwards. At the source of the Minnesota River there is put down a large lake called \"Lake of the Teetons.\" Whether this was intended for Big Stone Lake, or for what we now call Devil's Lake, in Dakota, may admit of a doubt. Besides this, these maps locate a portion of the Teton2 (Titorjwarj) and the Yankton (Ihanktorjwarj) on the east side of the Missouri, down in Iowa, whence came the names of the streams, Big and Little Sioux. In the \"French and Indian war,\" the Dakota nation took no part.3 But very soon after the English came into possession of Canada and the French ports in the northwest, a company of Dakota braves visited Green Bay to solicit the trade of the Englishmen. They told the officer in charge that if the Ojibwa or other Indians attempted to shut up the way to them (the Dakota), to send them word, and they would come and cut them off, \"as all Indians were their dogs.\" Previous to this time, the \"Sioux of the East\" had given the number 1 Hirjharjetoijwan approximates Ihanktonwan. Nasalizing the \"n's\" will make this change. j. o. D. 2 Perhaps the present Ihanktonwan gens of the Si6angu (Titpnwan) see list of Tatarjka-wakarj includes those whose ancestors intermarried with the Yaukton proper, when part of the Titonwarj were neighbors of the Yankton. j. o. \u00bb. 3The only thing I find which looks like participation at all, is a record of arrivals at Montreal in 1746, July 31. \"Four Sioux came to ask for a commandant.\"MIGRATION'S ARGUMENTS FROM HISTORY. 179 of the \"Sioux of the West\" as \"more than a thousand tepees.\" It is added, \"They do not use canoes, nor cultivate the earth, nor gather wild rice. They remain generally in the prairies, which are between the Upper Missis\u00ad sippi and the Missouri Rivers, and live entirely by the chase.\" Jonathan Carver, a native of New England, was the first English traveler who visited the country of the Dakota and added to our knowledge of their history. He left Boston in June of 1766, and by the way of Green Bay and the Wisconsin River he reached the Mississippi at the town whose name he writes \"La Prairie les Chiens,\" consisting, as he says, of fifty houses. This was then, and for maii}^ years after, the great fur mart of the Upper Mississippi. The villages of the Sauk and Fox lie passed on the Wisconsin River. The Dakota he first met near the mouth of the St. Croix. For years past they had been breaking away from their old home on Knife Lake and making their villages along down the river. Hence the name of \"River Bands,\" a term that then comprised the \"Spirit Lake,\" the \"Leaf Villagers,\" and the \" Sisseton.\" The Nadouessies of the plains, he says, were divided into eight bands, not including the Assiniboin. Carver ascended the St. Pierre River for some distance and wintered with a camp of Indians. In the spring he descended, with several hundred Dakota, to the mouth of the river.. When they came to deposit their dead, in what seems to have been a general place of interment, in the cave, since called \"Carver's Cave,\" Jonathan claims to have obtained from them a deed of the land. This purchase, however, has never been acknowledged by the Sioux. Carver found, in 1766, the Dakota at war with the Ojibwa, ana was told that they had, been fighting forty years. Before the year 1800 the Ojibwa had driven the Dakota from what hold they had on the Sandy Lake and Leech Lake country. As the Indian goods commenced to come to them up the Mississippi, they were naturally drawn doivn to make more perma\u00ad nent villages on its banks. Then two forces united diverted the Dakota migration to the south and the west. The Government of the United States, in the year 1805, sent into the Dakota and Ojibwa countries Lieut. Zebulon M. Pike, for the purposes of regulating the trade and making alliances with the Indians. He met the Dakota first at Red Wing, a short distance above Lake Pepin, and then at Kaposia, a short distance below where is now St. Paul. The respective chiefs were Red Wing and Little Crow. He also visited a Dakota village a short distance up the Minnesota River, and held a grand council with the Dakota assembled on the point where Fort Snelling was afterwards built.180 DAKOTA GEAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. On his downward trip in the following spring, he met Wabashaw's band, the Kiyuksa, below Lake Pepin. As he ascended the Mississippi as far as Leech Lake, and found the country above the Falls of St. Anthony, in the main, occupied by Ojibwa, the inference is that the Dakota had, in the pre\u00ad vious years, been driven by their enemies from that part of the country. One reason for this was, that the Ojibwa were furnished with firearms be\u00ad fore the Dakota A second reason was found in the drawing of the fur trade. And a third was the gradual disappearance of the buffalo in the wooded country of the Mississippi. At this date the Sisseton and Yankton were on the head waters of the Minnesota. Delegations of. these bauds met Lieut. Pike in the spring, and proceeded to a grand council at Prairie du Chien. Old men still living- relate how the \"Wahpeton, or Leaf Village, when they retired from the bullets of the Ojibwa on the east of the Mississippi, pitched their tents towards the northwest corner of what is now the State of Iowa, and when they returned they established their planting village at what has been called Little Rapids, on the lower part of the Minnesota River. In about 1810, a portion of them removed up to an island in Big Stone Lake, and afterwards a larger part settled at Lac qni Parle. Until after the middle of this century, the habitats of the Dakota were, for the Mclay-wakan-ton (Mde-wakarj torjwai)), the Mississippi River from Winona to the Falls of St. Anthony, and up the Minnesota as far as Shakopee. The Leaf Shooters (Wahpekute) were on the Cannon River, where Fari- bault now is; and the Wahpeton (Leaf Village) were, as stated, at the Little Rapids, and Lac qui Parle and the lower end of Big Stone Lake. The Sisseton occupied the Blue Earth country and the southern bend of the Minnesota, while the great body of them were at the villages on Lake Traverse. The Yankton, Yanktonai, Cut-heads, and Titorjwarj were on the great prairies to the westward. When Lieut. Pike made his tour up the Mississippi, in the years 1805 and 1806, he found much of the trade, in the Dakota and Ojibwa countries, in the hands of men who were in sympathy with Great Britain. The trad\u00ad ers, many of them, were Englishmen, and the goods were British goods. It is not strange then, that, in the war of 1812, the Dakota, together with other Indians of the Northwest, were enlisted in the war against the United States. This was brought about mainly by Robert Dickson, a Scotchman, who was at this time at the head of the fur trade in this part of the coun\u00ad try. Under his leadership the Dakota, the Ojibwa, the Winnebago, the Menonionie, the Sauk and Fox, and others, were brought into action,MIGRATIONS A'KGUMENTS FliOM HISTORY. 181 against the soldiers of the States, at Mackinaw, at Rock Island, and at Prai\u00ad rie du Chien. Of the Dakota villages, Little Crow and Wabashaw are especially mentioned. Joseph Renville, afterwards of Lac qui Parle, and other traders, were the lieutenants ot Col. Dickson. History tells us of but two Dakota men who kept themselves squarely on the American side during the war. One of these was the special friend (Koda) of Lietit. Pike, his name being Ta-ma-he, meaning the pike fish. Probably he took that name as the friend of Pike. He went to St. Louis at the commencement, of the war, and was taken into the employ of Gen. Clarke. He lived until after the middle of this century, always wore a stovepipe hat, had but one eye, and claimed to be the only \"American\" of his tribe. It does not appear that the war of 1812 changed the location of Da\u00ad kota. They still occupied the Mississippi above the parallel of 43J\u00b0, and the Minnesota, and westward. In 1837-'38, the \"Lower Sioux,\" as they were called, ceded to the Government their title to the land east of the great river. In. 1851, all the Mississippi and Minnesota Dakota sold to the Government all their claim to the country as far west as Lake Traverse, except a reservation on the Upper Minnesota. A year or two afterwards they removed to this reservation, and were there until the outbreak of August, 1862, which resulted in the eastern Dakota, or those coining under the general name of Santees, being all removed outside of the lines of Min\u00ad nesota. A part of those Indians fled to Manitoba, and a part across the Missouri, supposed to be now with (Tatarjka lyotanke) Sitting Bull a -part were transported to Crow Creek on the Missouri, who afterwards were permitted to remove into the northeast angle of Nebraska. This is now the Santee Agency, from whence a colony of sixty families of homesteaders have settled on the Big Sioux. Still another portion were retained by the military as scouts, which have been the nuclei of the settlements on the Sisseton and Fort Totteii reservations. About what time the Dakota in their migrations westward crossed over the Missouri River, to, remain and hunt on the western side, is a ques\u00ad tion not easily settled. There are various traditions of other neighbor tribes, which indicate pretty certainly that the Sioux were not there much over one hundred years ago. Dr. Washington Matthews, of the U. S. Army, relates that the Ber- thold1 Indians say,.\"Long ago the Sioux were all to the east, and none to the West and South, as they now are.\" In those times the western plains must have been very sparsely peopled with hostile tribes in comparison 1 These may be the Hidatsa, Manclan, and Arikara tribes. J. o. D.182 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. with the present, for the old men now living, and children of men of the past generation, say that they traveled to the southwest, in search of scalps, to a country where the prairie ceased, and were gone from their village twenty-one moons. Others went to the north to a country where the sum\u00ad mer was but three moons long. The French maps of this western country, made about one hundred and twenty-five years ago, are, in many things, very inaccurate, but may be received as indicating the general locality of Indians at that time. In. one of the maps the Ponka, Pawnee, and some of the Oto, together with the Panimaha, 1 are placed on the Platte and its branches. Other villages of the Maha (Omaha) are placed, apparently, above the mouth of the James or Dakota River, on the eastern side of the Missouri. The Iowa, the Oto, and the Yankton and Teton Dakota are placed down in what is now the State of Iowa. When Lewis and Clarke ascended the Missouri, in the autumn of 1803, they met the Yankton Dakota about, the mouth of the James or Dakota River, where Yankton now stands. Their village was some distance above, perhaps about the site of Bon Homme. They met the Teton Dakota at the mouth of the Teton or Little Missouri (Wakpa sica), where old Fort Pierre stood. These were of the Oglala band. Tradition says that the Oglala were the first to cross the Missouri, and that this was the place of crossing. At first they went over to hunt. The buffalo were found to be more abundant. They returned again. But after- several times going and returning they remained, and others followed. At the commencement of this century some Teton were still on the east side of the river, but their home seems to have been then, as now, on the west side. As this is the only notice of their meeting Teton on their ascent, we infer that the main body of them were not on the Missouri, but far in the interior.2 ARGUMENT FROM NAMES OF NATIONS, TRIBES, ETC. In all primitive states of society the most reliable history of individuals and nations is .found written in names. Sometimes the removals of a people can be traced through the ages by the names of rivers or places 1 Skidi or Pawnee Loup. 2 In the winter count of American Horse (4th An. Rep. Bur. Eth., p. 130), Standing-Bull, a Dakota, discovered the Black Hills in the winter of 1775-'76. The Dakota have of late years claimed the Black Hills, probably by right of discovery in 1775-'76; but the Crow were the former possessors, and were found in that region by the Ponka before the time of Marquette (i. e., prior to the date of his autograph map, 1673). J. o. D.MIGRATIONS ARGUMENT FROM NAMES. 183 which they have left behind them. The Dakota people, on the other hand, carry with them, to some extent, the history of their removals in the names of the several bands. DAKOTA. The Sioux people call themselves Dakota.1 They say \"Dakota\" means \"league\" or \"alliance\" they being allied bands. And this meaning is con\u00ad firmed by other uses of the word in the language. The name Sioux, on the other hand, was given to them by their enemies. In the preceding account the word \" Nadouessi,\" or \" Nadouessioux,\" is of frequent occurrence. The Huron, and perhaps other western Indians, called the Iroquois Nadowe or Nottaway, which is said to mean enemy. Because they were ever on the war-path, as were the Six Nations, the Dakota were styled the Iroquois of the West, and, for distinction's sake, were called Nadouessioux, enemies. The last part of the word stuck, and has become a part of their history. The Ojibwa, it appears, called the Dakota by the name of Bwarj, which comes out in the name Assiniboin, Stone Dakota; and a small band, or family, of the Assiniboin are called Stoneys, living in the Dominion of Canada. Spirit Lake Villages. We have seen that Du Luth and Hennepin first visited the villages of the Dakota on the islands and shores of Mille Lacs, which was their Mde-wakarj, and hence the name Mde-wakarj-torjwan. This name has come down through more than two centuries, and still attaches to a portion of the people, and is abiding evidence of their having lived on the head of Rum River. Not long after their first discovery by white men, if not at the time, a portion of this same band of Dakota were called Matanton, which name appears to be a contraction of Mde-tarjka-torjwarj, meaning Village of.the Great Lake. This was only a designation given to a portion of Mille Lacs. Before the end of that century these people began to make their villages along down Rum River, and perhaps also on the Mississippi, and so ob\u00ad tained the name of Wakpa-atorjwarj, Village on the River. But, after one hundred and fifty years, this, with the name preceding, passed out of use. As previous to this time the Ojibwa had contented themselves with the shores of Lake Superior, but were now getting an advantage over the Dakota in the first possession of firearms, we find the Dakota, who pitched their tents westward and northward, toward Leech Lake and Sandy Lake, earning the name of \" Chonkasketons \" (Carjkaske-torjwarj), Fortified Vil- In the Tetou dialect this is Lakota.184 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. lages.1 From the name we read that they were in a wooded country and made wooden protections from the assaults of their enemies. Some of the families appear to have made the gathering of the wild rice in the lakes a specialty, and so for a century or more we find them known as the Villages of Wild Rice Gatherers. When the Frenchmen, in 1680, joined the buffalo hunt of the Dakota, they remarked that they killed them with stone-headed arrows and cut up the meat with stone knives. The sharp flint stone used for this purpose they found on the banks of the Thousand Lakes, and hence the name of \" wakarj,\" or mysterious. And from this fact also they called the lake, or a part of it, by the name of \"Isarj-ta-mde,\" Lake of Knives, or Knife Lake. From living there the whole of those eastern Sioux were called \"Isan-ya-ti\" Knife Dwellers which has been modified to SANTEE. For a century or more past there has been included in this name The Leaf-shooters (Wahpekute), and also Leaf Village (Walipetorjwarj). 2 Both these last-named bands continued to dwell, for the most part, in the wooded country, as their names indicate. In the list of Dakota bands furnished by Le Sueur, about the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Wahpatons, or Leaf Villages, are classed with what Avas then called \"The Sioux of the West.\" And a somewhat singular combination occurs in the name \"Wa- hpeton-Teton,\" indicating that some of the Leaf Village band had become \" Dwellers on the Prairie.\" Other names of divisions at that period, such as \"Great Wild Rice Vil\u00ad lage,\" \"Grand Lodge Village,\" \"Dung Village,\" etc., have gone into disuse. Nor is it possible, at this time, to discover to what families they belonged. Two hundred years ago, the Dakota nation was said to consist of seven Council Fires. Of these we have already spoken of three, viz: Spirit Lake (Mdewakantonwan), Leaf Shooters (Wahpekute), and Leaf Village (Walipe- torjwarj). SISSETON. Coming next to these is the Sisseton band. The meaning of the name is not quite clear; but Mr. Joseph Renville, of Lac-qui-parle, in his day re\u00ad garded as the best authority in Dakota, understood it to mean \"Swamp 1 Another version of this name is \" Brave-heart's/' as if from Caijte, heart, and ka4ka; to bind. 2 See testimony of Rev. A. L. Riggs in foot-note - on-pp. 159,160.MIGBATIONS ABGUMENT FROM NAMES. 185 Village.\"1 This well accords with the early history, which. places them in the marshy parts of the country. From the head waters of the Mississippi they journeyed southward to the country of Swan Lake and the Blue Earth, and above, on the Minnesota River. Here they were found early in the eighteenth century, and here a portion of them still remained until after 1850. But the great body of them had removed up to the Lake Traverse region before the war of 1812. The great Sisseton chief of those times was Red Thunder (Wakirjyarj duta), still spoken of by his descendants. Since 1862 the Sisseton live on the Sisseton and Wahpeton Reservation, and at Devil's Lake, both of which are in Dakota. YANKTON. The Ihaijktorjwarj, now shortened to Yankton,. were the \"Villages'of the Border.\" The \"End,\" or \"Border,\" appears to have been that of the wooded country. Connected with them, and to be treated in the same cate\u00ad gory, are the YANKTONAI. * They were both Borderers. The name of the latter (Iharjktorjwarjna)\" is, in the Dakota, simply a diminutive of the former; but for more than a century possibly more than two centuries the distinction has been recog\u00ad nized. The Assiniboin branched off from the Yanktoiiai. Other divisions of them, reaching down to the present time, are the Sanonee2 (or One Sidersf), the Cut Heads (Pabakse); Kiyuksa or Dividers; Breakers of the law; the Pine Shooters (Wazikute), and the Hurjkpa-tina, or Hooiikpatee. 'This last name is explained in other parts of this volume. The same word is found in the name of one of the Teton divisions, now become somewhat notorious as the robber band of \" Sitting Bull,\" viz: The Hurjkpapa, or, as it is incorrectly written, Unkpapa. Both of these bands have for many years roamed over the Upper Missouri country one on the east and the other on the west side. The name of \"Pine Shooters,\" by which one division of the Yanktoiiai is still called, they brought from the pine country of Minnesota, 3 and must have retained through at least two centuries. As the Yankton, who now live on the Missouri River, at the Yankton Agency, claim to have been placed by the Taku Wakarj as guardians of 1 For another explanation of this terra, see \" Sisitorjwai) \" in the preceding chapter, p. 158. 2 The Sarjonu.

Fifty years after that, we find them placed on the French maps about the mouth of the Little Sioux River. In those times they hunted buffalo in the northwestern part of Iowa and down the Missouri to its mouth and up to their present location or above, and eastward over the James River and the Big Sioux to the Red Pipe Stone, where was the gath\u00ad ering of the nations.1 TETON. These have been known for two hundred years and how much longer we know not as \"Dwellers on the Prairie.\" The full name was Tiyta- toyway. Prairie dwelling, contracted now into Titorjwan, and commonly written Teton. As we have already seen, the French, in their map?, made a great lake at the head of the Minnesota River, which they called \"Lake of the Tetons.\" The name gives us nothing more than Inhabitants of the Prairie. There is abundant evidence that, as far back as our knowledge of the Dakota Nation extends, the Teton have formed more than half the tribe, and causes have been in operation which have increased their number, while in some cases the more eastern bands have been diminished. The buffalo hunt has always tended to increase the Teton somewhat by immi\u00ad gration; and by furnishing a supply of wild meat their children have grown up, while many of those who came to use flour and pork have died off. The late wars of the Minnesota Dakota with the whites have operated in the same way. As the result of the massacre of Spirit Lake, on the border of Iowa, in the spring of 1857, a large portion of the small band of Leaf Shooters, under the leadership of Iijkpaduta's family, have disappeared from the east of the Missouri and become absorbed by the Teton. The same thing is true of hundreds of those engaged in the massacre of 1862. While a large number fled north into the Dominion of Canada, others, in 1863, crossed 1 Near the mouth of the Missouri, where in oue of its beuds it approaches the Mississippi, is a place called Portage des Sioux. Here, evidently, the Dakota, a century ago, carried their canoes across from one river to the other, when on their hunting and war expeditious. This fact quite agrees with what we are told of their war parties descending the Mississippi two centuries ago, to attack the Illinois and Miamis. The Yanktonai passed over to the Upper Minnesota, and from thence, and from the Red River of the North, they have journeyed westward to the Missouri, led on by the buffalo, from which they have obtained their living for more than a century and a half. Thus they have occupied the country as it was vacated by the more numerous of the \"Seven Council Fires.\"MIGRATIONS ARGUMENT FROM NAMES. 187 the Missouri and joined the various northern divisions of the \"Dwellers on the Prairie.\" It is curious to find the number seven occurring so frequently in their tribal and family divisions. 1 Of the whole tribe there were seven bands or \"council fires;\" of the Spirit Lake band there were seven villages, and of this great body of the Dakota Nation there are still seven-divisions or subg-entes. . . First. The Brules: This is the French translation of Sicarjgu \"Burnt Thighs.\" They occupy, at present, the mouth of Makaizite River2 and up to Fort Thompson. The origin of this name is uncertain. They are divided into Uplanders and Lowlanders. Second. The Two Kettles, or Oohe nonpa, literally, \"Two Boilings:\" One story is, that the name originated in a time of great scarcity of pro\u00ad visions, when the whole band had only enough of meat to put in two kettles. The present headquarters of this band, as well as of the two that follow, is at the Cheyenne Agency and .at Standing Rock, on the Missouri. Third. The Minnekanjoo: The full name is Mini-karjye-wozupi (Water-near to-plant), \" Planters by the Water.\" We ask, \"What water?\" They do not remember. It looks very much as though the name had a history 1possibly in Minnesota more than a century ago. Fourth. The Sans Arcs: This is the French translation of their own name, Itazipco; which written in full is, Itazipa-codan, \"Bows without\" or \"No Bows.\" It is easy to imagine a few families of Dakota appearing, at some time of need, without that necessary implement of the chase and war, and so, having fastened upon them a name, which they would not have chosen for themselves. Fifth. The Uglala, or Ogalala, meaning Scatterers: This name em\u00ad bodies the peculiar characteristics of the Teton dialect of the language, viz: The frequent use of the hard \"g\" and the \"1.\" Sixth. The Black Feet, or Siha sapa: This band of the Western Dakota must not be confounded with the Black Feet3 of the mountains, which are connected with the Piegans and Bloods. The Oglala and Black Feet Dakota mainly constitute the camps of Spotted Tail and Red Cloud. But the bands are all a good deal mixed up by marriage and otherwise. Seventh.

The war of 1876 made it somewhat notorious under its war chief \"Sitting Bull,\" or \"Sitting Buffalo,\" as Tatarjka iyotarjke ought to be translated. This article, on the Migrations of the Dakota, will not be complete, without a brief notice of the affiliated tribes. The Dakota family, as shown by similarity of language, is quite extensive. ASSINIBOIN. I. Evidently the first to claim our attention, outside of the Dakota themselves, is the Assiniboin tribe. Indeed they are a part of the great Dakota Nation. Their language differs less from the Dakota in general, than the dialects of the Dakota do from each other. In our historical nar\u00ad rative of the Dakota, we found the knowledge of the Assiniboin coming to white people at the same time, and along with that of the Dakota proper. More than two centuries ago Assiniboin and Dakota met the French traders at the head of Lake Superior. The Assiniboin are said to have broken off from the Pine Shooters (Wazikute), a branch of the Iharjktorjwarjna. At that time the split, by which they ranged themselves as a separate people, appears to have been a recent thing. The name \"Bwarj,\" applied by the Ojibwa to the whole Dakota people, fastened itself on that branch. They are Stone Dakota. And at the present time, we have information of a small family of the Assinihoin people living 011 the Saskatchewan, which goes by the name of Stonies. The name given to the Assiniboin by the Dakota is Hohe,1 the origin and meaning of which are in the darkness. At the time we first learn anything of the Assiniboin, they appear to have been occupying the country of the Red River of the North, probably both on the eastern and western side. Their migrations have been north\u00ad ward and westward. About the. middle of the seventeenth century a French pilot, by name Grosellier, roamed into the country of the Assini\u00ad boin, near Lake Winnipeg, and was taken by them to Hudson Bay. In 1803 Lewis and Clarke met Assiniboin at their winter camp near where Fort Stevenson now is. But their movement westward seems to have been mainly farther north up the Assiniboin and Saskatchewan rivers. At pres\u00ad ent they are found in the neighborhood of Fort Peck, 011 the Upper Mis\u00ad souri, but the most of them are within the Dominion of Canada. 1 Prououoced ho'-liay.

Two centuries and a third ago the French traders and missionaries from Montreal and Quebec came in contact with the Puants, living 011 the \"Bay of the Puants,\" now Green Bay, in Wisconsin. These Indians were called Winnepekoak, or \"People of the fetid water,\" by their Algonkian neighbors; but their name for themselves is Hotcangara, \"People of the Original Speech,\" modified to Hotarjke by the Dakota, and Hu^aiiga by the Omaha and Poiika, though these modified names signify \"Big Voices\" in their respective languages.. The Winnebago language is closely allied to the Dakota.1 One can not but think that less than a thousand years ago they Avere a part of the same people. They may have separated at an early period from these cognate tribes, and even reached \"salt water,\" whence their Algonkian name. Examples of such separation are found in the Biloxi of Mississippi and the Yesau or Tutelo, formerly of Virginia and North Carolina, now in Canada. But, confining ourselves to history, two centuries ago the Winnebago were on Lake Michigan. During the eighteenth century they had drifted slowly across the State of Wisconsin. In 1806 Lieut Pike met the Puants2 with the Fox at Prairie clu Chien. In the war of 1812 the Winnebago, with the tribes of the Northwest generally, ranged themselves on the side of the British. While a small portion of the tribe remained in the interior of Wis\u00ad consin, the majority were removed across the Mississippi into Iowa and located on Turkey River about the year 1840. Thence they were taken up to Long Prairie, in Minnesota. Not being at all satisfied with that country, they were again removed to what was to be a home in Blue Earth County, back of Mankato. They were supposed to have had some sympathy with the Dakota in their outbreak of 1862, and accordingly they were removed with the captured Dakota, in the spring following, to the Missouri River. Their location at Crow Creek was highly distasteful to them, and, accordingly, they made canoes and floated themselves down to the Omaha Reservation, in Nebraska, 011 a portion of which the Government arranged to have them remain. It should be mentioned that the Winnebago were largely engaged in the French and Indian War. Forty-eight were present in 1757 at the 1 See ' 'Comparative Phonology of Four Siouaii Languages,\" in Smifcbson. Kept., 1883. j. o. i). 2The name Puants means Stinkers.

But it is believed they were in error, and that its proper meaning is salt water.190 DAKOTA GKAMMAB, TEXTS, AKD ETHNOGRAPHY. battle of Ticonderoga, together with large numbers of the Ojibwa and other Western bands. OMAHA AND PONKA. These tribes have a common dialect and are closely related to the Osage, Kansa, and Kwapa. The first are the Maha of the old French maps. The five tribes form the (jpegiha (or Dhegiha) group of the Siouaii family. According to their traditions, their ancestors dwelt east of the Mississippi River, on the Ohio and Wabash. When they reached the mouth of the Ohio, part went down the Mississippi, becoming the Kwapa (U^aqpa, Ugaqpa), or \" Down-stream People,\" who afterwards met De Soto. The others ascended the Mississippi; hence the name \" Up-stream People,\" or U-man-hau (Umarjharj), now Omaha, applied at first to those who subse\u00ad quently became four tribes (Omaha, Ponka, Osage, and Kansa). Another separation occured near the. mouth of the Osage River, where the Omaha and Ponka crossed the Missouri, and went north, being joined on the way by a kindred tribe, the Iowa. These three wandered through Iowa and Minne\u00ad sota till they found the Great Pipestone Quarry, where they made a set\u00ad tlement. At that time the Yankton (perhaps including the Yanktonnai) dwelt in a wooded region near the source of the Mississippi, being called a People of the Forest\" by the Omaha and Ponka.1 The three tribes were finally driven off by the Dakota, wandering westward and southwestward till they reached the Missouri River, which they followed as far as the mouth of White Earth River. There the Ponka left their allies, ascending' the White Earth River till they drew near the Black Hills, which they found in the possession of the Crows. Retracing their course, they joined the Iowa and Omaha, and all three went down along the southwest side of the Missouri River till the Niobrara was reached. There was made the final separation. The Ponka remained at the mouth of the Niobrara; the Omaha settled on Bow Creek, Nebraska; the Iowa went beyond them till they reached Ionia Creek (probably loioa, Creek at first), where they made a village on the east bank of the stream, not far from the site of the present town of Ponka. The subsequent migrations of these tribes have been given in the paper mentioned in the preceding foot\u00ad note (l), as well as in the Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology (p. 213). The three tribes occupied different habitats as far back as Mar- quette's time, and they are thus located in his autograph map of 1673. 1 The migrations of the Kausa, Kwapa, Osage, etc., have been treated by the editor in a recent paper, \"Migrations of Siouati Tribes,\" which appeared in the American Naturalist March, 1886 (Vol. 22, pp. 211-222). See \"Omaha Sociology,\" i i the Third Ann. Kept, of the Director Bur. Eth., pp. 211-213. J. o. D.MIGBATIONS ARGUMENT FROM NAMES. 191 When, in 1803, Lewis and Clarke made their voyage up the Missouri and across the Rocky Mountains, they found the Ponka (Poncara) near their present location. They say, \"The Maha (Omaha) were associated with them for mutual protection.\" But the Omaha were there only on a visit. It is quite certain that they had not lived together for many years pre\u00ad vious to this. The Omaha were in northeastern Nebraska, south of Sioux City, Iowa. IOWA AND OTO. The two tribes Iowa and Oto are associated here because they are mentioned together by Le Sueur, in 1700, as having, previous to that time, had the occupancy and the hunters' right to the country of the Blue Earth and of southern Minnesota. 1 They appear to have retired before the aggressive Sioux down the DesMoines into central Iowa, the Oto going on to the Missouri and down into Kansas. While in possession of the country of the Blue Earth, we have notices of their having hunted on the St. Croix, in northern Wisconsin. It is also stated, which appears to be a matter of tradition, only, that at a much later date, not far from the commencement of the present century, the Iowa, in war, cut off entirely a small tribe, which dwelt south of the St. Croix, called the Unktoka, which means, Our Enemies- Ten Iowa warriors were present at the battle of Ticonderoga. There are, near the Minnesota River, old fortifications, or earthworks, which were probably made by these tribes to protect themselves against the incursions of the more powerful Dakota. One such is found a few miles above the mouth of the Yellow Medicine River. But possibly this was an old Cheyenne fortification, which would seem to be the reading of Dakota tradition. MANDAN AND HIDATSA. These two small tribes live together at Fort Berthold in connection with the Ree. They are both small tribes. The Mandan at present num\u00ad ber less than 400. Years ago they numbered many more, but wars and smallpox have almost annihilated them. From rather a remarkable fact, that many of this people have sandy hair, it has been affirmed that they are of Welsh origin supposed to be a lost Welsh colony. George Catlin, 'This must have been long before 1673, the date of Marquette's autograph map. The Oto did not accompany the Io\\va, Ponka, and Omaha.

The root of a grapevine pushed itself down through the crust of the earth. One by one .they took hold of it and climbed up by its help, coming out into the light of day. By and by a very fat woman, took hold of it and the vine broke, leaving the remainder of the Mandans by the lake underground. Could this legend have any connection with a passage over the ocean? ^ver since they have been known to the whites they have lived on the Upper Missouri. In the winter of 1S03-'04, Lewis and Clarke wintered near their villages, only a short distance below where they now are. The Hidatsa are better known by the names Minnetaree and Gros Ventres.2 There is no apparent reason why the latter name should have been given them by the French. Minnetaree means \"over the water,\" and was given to them when they crossed the Missouri, coming as they did from the northeast and crossing to the southwest. They number about 500. These Hidatsa have often been confounded with the \"Minnetaree of the Plains,\" or \"Gros Ventres,\" who belong-to another linguistic family. Both the Hidatsa and Mandan belong to the Siouan or Dakotan family. Whether it is from the common likeness to the tongue of their enemies, or for some other reason, it is a remarkable fact that many persons of each tribe can speak Dakota. ABSAROKA OR CROW. This tribe and the Hidatsa speak dialects of the same language. It is said that the Amahami, now extinct, were a branch of the Absaroka. When the Ponka reached the Black Hills country, several hundred years ago, they found it in the possession of the Absaroka, whose habitat included the region now known as the western part of Dakota (south of the Missouri River) and the eastern part of Montana. 11 have made a careful examination of the Mandan vocabularies of Kipp. Haydeu, Wied, and others. The following conclusions have been reached: (1) The Mandan is closely related to the Wimiebago, Iowa, Oto, and Missouri dialects. (2) The fancied resemblance to the Latin, based on what was thought to be \"sub\" in three compound nouns, has no foundation. Suk, snke, kshuk, or kshuke means small. J. O.

The Missouri, who call themselves Nyu-t'a-tci, speak a dialect allied to those of the Iowa and Oto, while the dialects of the others are related to that of the Omaha and Ponka. The Osage connect themselves by tradition with the beavers. The first father of the Osage was hunting on the prairie all alone. He came to a beaver dam, where he saw the chief of all the beavers, who gave him one of his daughters to wife. From this alliance sprang the Osage.1 ARIKARA OR RICKAREE. This tribe, commonly called Ree and sometimes Pawnee, has been heretofore counted as belonging to the Dakota family. But the Ree language, as spoken at Berthold, appears to have no resemblance to the Dakota, and indeed to be radically different in its construction. So that, without doubt we must deny them a place in the Dakota linguistic family. But the Ree, the northern branch of the tribe now at Fort Berthold, num\u00ad bering more than 1,000 souls, have been for many years intermingling with the Dakota, and probably separated from their southern kindred, the Pawnee proper, on account of an intrusion of the Dakota.2 In 1803 Lewis and Clarke found the Ree on the Missouri River, near the mouth of Grand River. SHAYENNE OR CHEYENNEE. This name is variously written. The tribe comes into .the same cate\u00ad gory as the last named Ree and Pawnee. We can not admit them into the Dakota linguistic family. The name they bear is of Dakota origin, by whom they are called \"Sha-e-a-na.\" 3 Sha-e-a,4in Dakota, means \"to talk red,\" that as \" Ska-e-a\"5 means \"to talk white\" intelligi\u00ad bly that is, to interpret. The Shayenue language then, we under\u00ad stand, is not like the Dakota. But, though sometimes enemies of the Dakota, they have more generally been confederates. Two hundred years 1 This is probably the tradition of part of the Osage, the Beaver people, not that of the whole tribe. See \" Osage Traditions \" in the Sixth Ann. Rept. of the Director Bur. Eth., pp, 373-397. J. O. D. -According to Omaha tradition, the Ree and Skidi (or Pawnee Lonps) were allies of the Winne- bago the ancestors of the Omaha, Ponka, Osage, Kausa, Kwapa, Iowa, etc., when all these people dwelt east of the Mississippi. It is doubtful whether the Ree were ever neighbors of the Grand, Re\u00ad publican, and Tappage Pawnee, since the latter have been west of the Missouri. The latter conquered the Skidi, with whom they do not intermarry, according to Joseph I-a Fleche, formerly a head chief of the Ouiaha. The Skidi met the three southern Pawnee divisions at a comparatively late date, ac\u00ad cording to Pawnee tradition. If all five were ever together, it must have been at an early period, and probably east of the Mississippi River. J. o.

From thence, according to Dakota tradition, they retired before the advancing Dakota, and made their village between Big Stone Lake and Lake Traverse. Their next remove appears to have been to the south bend of the Cheyenne, a branch of the Red River of the North. The fortification there is still very plain. While there they seem to have had both the Ojibwa and Dakota for their enemies. Bloody battles were fought and finally the Shayenne retired to the Missouri. This is supposed to have been about one hundred years ago or more. After that time the Dakota became friendly to them. The Shayenne stopped on the east side of the Missouri and left their name to the Little Cheyenne. Soon after they crossed over and took possession of the country of the Big Cheyenne. There they were, hunting out to the Black Hills, in 1803, when Lewis and Clarke ascended the Missouri.C H A P T E E, III. GENS AND PHRATRY OF THE DAKOTA. THE GENS.

The chieftainship descended from the father to his sons, the eldest son taking the precedence. But in the making up of the gens the Avoman was an equal factor with the man. Thus a child counts his father's brothers all fathers, and his father's sisters all aunts; while his mother's sisters are all mothers, and his mother's brothers are only uncles. Hence, a man's brother's children are counted as his own children, and his sister's children are nephews and nieces. On the other hand, a woman's sister's children are counted by her as children, while her brother's children are nephews and nieces.1 These .same distinctions are carried down through the generations. In. this circle intermarriages are not allowed by Dakota custom. This is the gens, but there is lacking the totem\"to bind them to\u00ad gether. The real foundation for the totemic system exists among the Da\u00ad kota as well as the Iroquois, in the names of men often being taken from mythical animals, but the system was never carried to perfection. Some\u00ad times indeed a village was called through generations after the chief of the clan, as Black Dog's, Little Crow's, etc. THE PHRATRY. Among the eastern Dakota the Phratry was never a permanent organi\u00ad zation, but resorted to on special occasions and for various purposes, such as war or buffalo hunting. THE TIYOTIPI. The exponent of the Phratry was the \"Tiyotipi\" or Soldiers' Lodge. Its meaning is the \" Lodge of Lodges.\" There were placed the bundles of black and red sticks of the soldiers. There the soldiers gathered to talk and smoke and feast. There the laws of the encampment Avere enacted, 1 See Kinship System of the Oinah\u00abi in 3d Ann. Rept. of the Director, Bur. Eth.; pp. 252-258. J. o .D. 195196 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. and from thence they were, published by the camp crier. It is said that in the camps of the Prairie Dakota, the real buffalo hunters, the Soldiers' Lodge was pitched in the center of the circular encampment. This area Avas called ho-co-ka; and the gateway of the camp, which was always left at the front end, Avas called ho-a-na-pa. The encampment \\vas then in the form of a horseshoe, or, more properly, in the form of the horns of a buf\u00ad falo COAV, Avhich turn imvard toward each other. The ends of the horns Avere called \" Hun-kpa,\" from \" he,\" a horn, and \" inkpa,\" small end. Hence those camping at these ends of the horns Avould be called \" Hunkpa-tina.\" And hence the name of tAvo of the gentes, Avhich haA^e developed into larger clans of the Dakota Nation, viz., the Hurjkpatina and the Hurjkpapa. While, Avithin the historical period, no political organization has been knoAvn to exist over the Avhole Dakota Nation, the traditional alliance of the \"Seven Council Fires\" is perpetuated in the common name Dakota. FELLOWHOOD. One of the customs of the olden time, which was potent both for good and for evil, and which is going into desuetude, was that of fellowhood. Scarcely a Dakota young man could be found who had not some special friend or Koda. This Avas an arrangement of giving themselves to each other, of the David and Jonathan kind. They exchanged boAvs, or guns, or blankets sometimes the entire equipment. In. rare cases they exchanged wives. What one asked of the other he gave him ; nothing could be de\u00ad nied. This arrangement was often a real affection, sometimes fading out as the years pass by, but often lasting to old age. In order to exhibit properly and as fully as may be Dakota national and individual life, I will here introduce a pen picture of a very prominent man of the last generation. STANDING BUFFALO. In connection with Standing Buffalo, the last great chieftain of the Sisseton Dakota, will be found a description of the \"Tiyotipi,\" already referred to. Ta-tan-ka-na-zirj, or Standing Buffalo, Avas the son of The Orphan, and hereditary chief of quite a large clan of Sisseton Dakota. Their planting place, before the outbreak in 1862, Avas in that rich and beautiful valley which lies between the head of Lake TraA^erse, Avhose waters communicate with the Bed River of the North and Big Stone Lake? through which theG-ENS AHD PHBATBY OF THE DAKOTA. 197 Minnesota River runs to the Mississippi. Through this isthmus, between the two lakes, now known as Brown's Valley, the Minnesota, as it comes down in small streams out of the Coteau, winds its way. As soon as Standing Buffalo had come to man's estate, or when he was probably about twenty-five years old, the father abdicated his chieftainship in favor of his son. Henceforth he wore his father's medals, carried his father's papers, and was the recognized chief of his father's people. As already stated, the Dakota custom is that the rank and title of chief descend from father to son unless some other near relative is ambitious and influential enough to obtain the place. The same is claimed also in regard to the rank of soldier or brave, but this position is more dependent on personal bravery. At the time of the outbreak Standing Buffalo was a man in middle life. He was tall and well-featured rather a splendid looking Dakota. Pre\u00ad vious to 1852 he and his people received no annuities, but raised a good deal of corn. Still they depended chiefly, both for food and clothing, on the buffalo, and much of the year they spent in the chase. Although congregating in vast herds on the great prairies and moving in certain directions with a great deal of apparent force, the buffalo are nevertheless easily driven away. And hence the Indians find it necessary to protect the hunt by regulations which must be enforced. In this neces\u00ad sity probably originated the Ti-yo-ti-pi, or so-called Soldiers' Lodge, which is both the hall of legislation and the great feasting place. Some patriotic woman vacates her good skin tent and goes into a poorer one that she may furnish the braves with a fitting place for their as\u00ad semblies. This tipi is then pitched in some central place, or in the gate\u00ad way of the circle, and the women take delight in furnishing it with wood and water and the best of the meat that is brought into camp, for every good deed done for this Soldiers' Lodge is proclaimed abroad by the crier or eyanpaha. A good fire is blazing inside and we may just lift up the skin door and crawl in. Towards the rear of the tent, but near enough the fire for con\u00ad venient use, is a large pipe placed by the symbols of power. There are two bundles of shaved sticks about 6 inches long. The sticks in one bun\u00ad dle are painted black and in the other red. The black bundle represents the real men of the camp those who have made their mark on the war\u00ad path. The red bundle represents the boys and such men as wear no eagle feathers. Around this fire they gather together to smoke. Here they dis\u00ad cuss all questions pertaining to the buffalo hunt and the removal of camp;198 DAKOTA G-BAMMAB, TEXTS, AXD ErHNOGBAPHY. in short, all public interests. From these headquarters they send out from time to time runners, who bring back information of the whereabouts of the bison herds. From this lodge goes .out the camp crier, who makes procla\u00ad mation of the time and place of the buffalo surround. And from this same central place of power go forth the young men who are commissioned to cut up the tent and the blankets, or break the gun and kill the horse of one who has transgressed the laws of the Ti-yo-ti-pi. And when the hunt of the day is past, and the buffalo meat brought in, the breast or some nice piece is roasted or boiled here, and the young men gather to eat and smoke and sing and tell over the exploits of the day. It will not then surprise any one to know that this Soldiers' Lodge became the central force in the outbreak of 1862. In the summer before the outbreak took place, there was quite a trou\u00ad ble at the Yellow Medicine. The payment was promised to these annuity Indians when the strawberries were ripe, that is the last of June or the first of July of each year. This season the Sissetoii came down earlier perhaps than usual, and the annuity money and goods were delayed much beyond time. About 4,000 Indians were gathered at the Yellow Medicine, where they waited about six weeks. The small amount of provisions on hand Agent Gralbraith wished to keep until the time of making the payment. The corn and potatoes planted by Indians living- in the neighborhood had not yet matured. Consequently this multitude of men, women, and chil\u00ad dren were for more than a month 011 the borders of starvation. Some flour was obtained from traders, and the agent gave them small quantities; they gathered some berries in the woods and occasionally obtained a few ducks. But by all these means they scarcely kept starvation off. They said the children cried for something to eat. Standing Buffalo was the principal chief of these northern Indians. They were encamped in a large circle on the prairie immediately west of the agency. It was now along in the first days of August. Hunger pressed upon them. They knew there was flour in the warehouse which had been purchased for them. It would not be wrong for them to take it in their present necessitous circumstances. Thus they reasoned; and although a detachment of soldiers from Fort Ridgeley had their camp near the ware\u00ad house, the Indians planned to break in and help themselves. So it was, on a certain day, the men came down to the agency five or six hundred strong and surrounded the soldiers' camp. The white people thought they had come to dance; but while they stood around in greatGENS AND PHRATRY OF THE DAKOTA. 199 numbers, a selected few broke in the door of the warehouse with axes and carried out a large quantity of flour and pork. To this the attention of Agent Gralbraitti was immediately called, who made an ineffectual effort to have it carried back. The howitzer was turned towards the Indians and there was a prospect of a collision, but the numbers were so disproportion\u00ad ate that it was judged best to avoid it. Scarcely had they reached their own camp when those four hundred tents were struck, and all removed off to a distance of 2 or 3 miles. That was supposed to mean war. The next morning the writer visited the agency, having heard some\u00ad thing of the trouble. When I met the agent he said, \"Mr. Riggs, if there is anything between the lids of the Bible that will help us out of this diffi\u00ad culty, I wish you would use it.\" I said I would try, and immediately drove up to Standing Buffalo's camp. I represented to him the necessity of having this difficulty settled. However perfect they might regard their right to the provisions they had taken, the Government would not be willing to treat thern kindly until the affair was arranged. The breaking in of the ware\u00ad house was regarded as a great offense. He promised to gather the chief men immediately and talk the thing over and come down to the agency as soon as possible. It was afternoon when about fifty of the principal men gathered on the agent's porch. They said they were sorry the thing had taken place, but they could not restrain the young men, so great was the pressure of hunger in the camp. They wished, moreover, the agent to repair the broken door at their expense. Some of the young men who broke it down were present, but they did not want to have, them punished. It was rather a lame justi\u00ad fication, but Agent Gralbraith considered it best to accept of it and to give them some more provisions, on condition that they would return immedi\u00ad ately to their planting places at Big Stone Lake and Lake Traverse. This he desired them to do because the time when the payment could be made was unknown to him and their own corn patches would soon need watching. Standing Buffalo and his brother chiefs accepted the conditions, and in a couple of days the northern camp had disappeared. Four or five weeks after this, these warriors came down again to the Yellow Medicine and the Red Wood; but it was not to meet the agent or any white people, but to see Little Crow and the hostile Indians and ascer\u00ad tain whereunto the rebellion would grow. It is reported that, on this occa\u00ad sion, Standing Buffalo told Little Crow that, having commenced hostilities with the whites, he must fight it out without help from him; and that, failing200 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AlSTD ETHNOGRAPHY. to make himself master of the situation, he should not flee through the country of the Sisseton. But although as a whole these northern Dakota refused to go into the rebellion with the Santee, it is very certain that quite a number of their young men joined in the raids made upon the white settlements; and more\u00ad over, the attack upon Fort Abercrombie, at which several hundred Dakota warriors were said to have been present, must have been made almost entirely by these same Sisseton. In the autumn which followed they all fled to the Upper Missouri country or into the Queen's dominions. It was reported soon after that Standing Buffalo had gone 011 the warpath and was killed. . THE TIYOTIPI. ' [Translated from M. Renville's Dakota version.] When Indians would hunt the buffalo, they do it in this way: When\u00ad ever they hear that there are buffalo, they look out a young man and ask him for his tent. If he consents, then no woman or child is allowed in the tent; men alone go into it. And so the man whose the tent is is called Tiyoti, and is the master in it. Then also they do in this way: They shave out small round sticks all of the same length, and paint them red, and they are given out to the men. These are to constitute the Tiyotipi. This done, they choose four men whom they make the chiefs, who make all the arrangements. Also one who is called Eyanpaha (crier), who makes proclamation of everything that is determined on. In addition to these, they select two young men who are called Touchers. These attend to all the provisions that are brought to the Tiyotipi. Then, of all the painted sticks that were given around, not one is brought in empty. When one is to be brought to the Tiyotipi, food is brought with it. And when these are all brought in, they are tied in a bundle. In the back part of the tent, by the fire, the ground is carefully cleaned off, and a pipe and a pipe rammer and incense leaves are all brought and placed together. These are all completed in this way and then about two young men are selected, and the pipe is filled and passed to them, which is done by the Eyanpaha. ' When this ceremony is finished they are sent out into that part of the country in which they heard the buffalo were. Hence they areGENS AND PHKATRY OF THE DAKOTA. 201 called Wakcanya and also Wayeya, that is One-who-finds-out, and also One Sent. Whither they were sent they go, and when they know the buffalo are there, they return to camp. When they come near they run, and by this it is known that they are bringing tidings. Thus they come directly to the Tiyotipi, which is already filled with those who want to hear. Then in the back part of the tent, which has been made sacred, where the pipe and the tobacco are, there the Eyarjpaha fills the pipe and puts it to their mouths. Then privately they tell the news to the Eyanpaha, who says, \"Hayen, liayen,\" and spreads his hands out to the earth. All in the tent do the same, and then the news is told openly. The Eyanpaha then goes out and makes proclamation to the whole camp. But this he does in a somewhat different style: \"When a boy comes home to me from another place, and brings me word of so many large pieces of buffalo meat, let every ghost in all your families hear it; so far on the other side the earth is not visible, they say.\" While he cries this through the camp, all who are able whistle, which they do for joy. When the Eyanpaha has returned to the Tiyotipi, then the four masters of the assembly consider and determine when they will go on the hunt. This being determined, the Eyarjpaha again makes proclamation to all the people. This is what he says: \"Bind on your saddle, for a piece of a day I will kill valuable children.\" Then all get themselves ready and they start out together. Only the four chief men give the commands. When they come near to the buffalo, the party is divided and the approach is made from both sides. This is done whether there be one herd or two. They go on both sides. It is determined to conduct the chase in a proper manner. But if in doing this one side gets in a hurry and drives off the game, then their blankets and even their tents are cut to pieces. This they call \"soldier killing.\" When they come home from the buffalo chase, all who can bring fresh meat to the Tiyotipi. Then the Touchers cook it. When it is cooked they cut off some pieces and put in the mouths of the four chief men, and then they all eat as they please. In the meantime the Eyarjpaha stands outside and praises those who brought the meat. The summing up of the whole is this: The back part of the Tiyotipi, near the fire, is cleared off carefully; and there are placed two grass fenders, about a foot long each, on which the pipe is laid. The pipe is never laid202 DAKOTA GEAMMAE, TEXTS, AND ETHiSTOGEAPHl f. back after the common custom. Also they shave a round stick, sharpening one end and cutting the other off square. This is driven in the ground, and on it, when the pipe is smoked out, they knock out the ashes. They always do this. Then of all the round-shaved sticks, some of which were painted black and some painted red, four are especially marked. They are the four chiefs of the Tiyotipi that were made. And these men are not selected at random for this place; but men who have killed many enemies. and are the most able, are chosen. The things desired are, that the chase may be conducted in the best way, that the people may have a plenty of food, and that everything may be done properly so they determined, and so they do. The ashes of the pipe are not emptied out carelessly, so that when they command .-aach other, and give each other the pipe, it may be done only in truth. That is the reason for doing it. Also in the deer hunt they have a Tiyotipi, but in that they do not send out persons to reconnoiter. Nevertheless, in that also, if anyone goes to hunt on his own motion, they \"soldier kill\" him, that is, cut up his blanket and coat. These are the customs of the Otiyoti. Thus far the translation to which may be added some words of explanation. 1. The special making of the sticks is done on the line of personal history. Whatever is indicated by the kind of eagle feathers a man is entitled to wear in his head, and by the notches in them, this is all hiero- glyphed on his stick in the Tiyotipi. Then these bundles of sticks are used for gambling. The question is, \"Odd or even?\" The forfeits are paid in meat for the Tiyotipi. 2. The announcements of the crier show the rhythmical character of the language. This especially appears in the order for For half a day, I will kill.CHAPTER IV. UNWRITTEN DAKOTA LAWS. THE FAMILY. In the commencement and growth of the Dakota people and language we may properly assume that the words \"a-te,\" father, and \"i-na\" and \"him,\" mother (\"nihurj,\" thy mother, \"hurjku,\" his mother'), were among the very first. They are short, and not capable of further analysis. \"Wica,\" male, and '\"win\" or \"wirjna\" and \"wirjyarj,\" female, would be the first words to designate the man and woman. From these would grow naturally the present names, wi-ca-sta, 1 or the Yankton and Teton form, \"wi-da-sa\" (male-red), man, and winohrrjca 2 (female- very), woman. There-would be father-in-law before grandfather; and hence we find the former designated by \"turj-karj,\" 3 the shorter one/and the latter by \"turj-karj-si-na.\" \"Turj- kai)\" is also the name of the stone god, which may indicate some kind of worship of ancestors. The shortest word also is found in mother-in-law, \"kurj\" (\"nikun,\" thy mother-in-law, \"kurjku,\" his mother-in-law). A woman speaking of or to her mother-in-law and grandmother calls them both \"urjci,\" making- the latter sometimes diminutive \"mjcina.\" Some words for child should be at least as old, if not older than, father and mother. Accordingly we find the monosyllables \"cirjs,\" son, and \"duns,\" daughter, used by the parents when speaking to the children, while \"cirjca\" is the common form. In the line of \"wirj\" being the oldest form word for woman, we have the Dakota man calling his wife \"mitawirj,\" my woman. The word as wife is not used without the affixed and suffixed pronominal particles (mi-ta-wirj, nitawin, tawicu), which would indicate property in the woman. On the 1 While wica sa may mean \" male red,\" how shall we render wica s\"ta? Wica = c or wica sta = nikaci\"ga ((jtegiha). a person; an Indian. j. o D. \" to winoli6a. , in Santee; tugkaij-sina, in Yanktou; tui)kaij.sila, in Teton. 203204 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. other handj the woman calls her husband \"mihihna,\" my husband. The latter part of the word we can not analyze satisfactorily. 1 Thus we come into the family as constituted, the man calling his woman \"mi-ta-win,\" and she calling her man \"mi-hihna,\" and each calling the child \"cirjs\" or \"curjs,\" as the case may be. The taking of each other makes each related to the family of the other. But somehow shame has come into the tipi, and the man is not allowed to address or to look towards his wife's mother, especially, and the woman is shut off from familiar intercourse with her husband's father and others, and etiquette pro\u00ad hibits them from speaking the names of their relatives by marriage. This custom is called \"wisten kiyapi,\" from \"isteca,\" to be ashamed. How it grew is not apparent. But none of their customs is more tenacious of life than this. And no family law is more binding. THE HOUSEHOLD. The \"tipi\" is the house or living place. There is no word for home nearer than this. The Dakota woman owns the \"tipi;\" she dresses the skins of which the \"wakeya\" or shelter is made; she pitches and takes down the tipi, and carries it on her back oftentimes in the march. It should belong to her. But when it is pitched and the ground covered with dry grass, her man takes the place of honor, which is the back part opposite the door. The wife's place is on the left side as one enters, the right side as one sits in the back part. The children come in between the mother and father. The place of the grandmother or mother-in-law or aunt is the corner by the door opposite the woman of the house. If a man has more wives than one, they have separate tipis or arrange to occupy the different sides of one. When a daughter marries, if she remains in her mother's tipi, the place for herself and husband is on the side opposite the mother, and back near the \"catku,\" the place of honor. The same place is allotted to her in her husband's mother's tent. The back part of the tent, the most honorable place, and the one usually occupied by the father, is given to a stranger visitor. 'Mr. Dorsey is right, uudouLtedly, in regarding \"hna\" as the root, or at least one root, of \"ini-hi-hn^, my husband, f(hi-hna-kn,\" her husband. And the meaning of it is rather that of placing than of deceiving, relating it to \"ohnaka\" to place in, as if in the woman's family, rather than with \"hnayan,\" to deceive. But what account shall we make of the \"hi,\" or \"hirj,\" as many Dakotas per\u00ad sist in writing it? Does that mean hair, and so send the word back to an indelicate origin? Quite likely. s. R. R. Compare the Dakota tawinton, tawrnya, and tawiton, ''to have as his wife,\" used only of coition. See footnote ('), p. 207. J. o. D.UNWRITTEN DAKOTA LAWS. 205 The young man who goes to live with his wife's relatives is called \" wicawoha,\" which literally means man-cached, as if the man, by so doing, buried himself. Mothers, who have daughters to be married, are often de\u00ad sirous of having the sons-in-law come and live, for a while at least, with them, since, if the young man is a good hunter, this arrangement secures to them plenty of game. But on the other hand, the young man's parents are quite as likely to require his services and that of his wife in addition. So that, in this regard, there is no prevailing law. As soon as the young couple are able to procure a tent, and if the man is a good hunter and buf\u00ad falo are plenty, that may be very soon, they set up for themselves. This usually takes place soon after their first child is born, if not before. COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE. Before proceeding farther with the laws of the family, it is proper to describe how it becomes a family. Grirls are sometimes taken very young, before they are of marriageable age, which generally happens with a man who has a wife already. The marriageable age is from fourteen years old and upward. The intercourse of young men with maidens is not always open and honorable, but the public sentiment of a Dakota community, while it does not prevent much that is illicit, makes it more or less dishon- able, especially for the girl. A boy begins to feel the drawing of the other sex and, like the ancient Roman boys, he exercises his ingenuity in making a \"cotarjke,\" or rude pipe, from the bone of a swan's wing, or from some species of wood, and with that he begins to call to his lady love, on the night air. Having gained her attention by his flute, he may sing this: Stealthily, secretly, see ine, Stealthily, secretly, see me, Stealthily, secretly, see me; Lo! thee I tenderly regard; Stealthily, secretly, see me. Or he may commend his good qualities as a hunter by singing this song: Cling fast to me, and you 511 ever have plenty; Cling fast to me, and you '11 ever have plenty; Cling fast to me. When the family are abed and asleep, he often visits her in her mother's tent, or he finds her out in the grove in the daytime gathering fuel. She has the load of sticks made up, and when she kneels down to take it on her206 DAKOTA GBAMMA&r TEXTSr Ai\u00a3I> ETHNOGRAPHY: back possibly lie takes her hand and helps her up, and then walks home by her side. Such was the custom in the olden time. Thus a mutual under\u00ad standing is reached. He wants her and she wants him. He has seen her ability to supply the tipi with fuel as well as do other necessary things, and she has often seen him bringing to his mother's tent a back load of ducks, or, it may be, venison Capt. R. H. Pratt, of Carlisle school, tells a capital story of a Kiowa young man. who, under a variety of circumstances, never \"cared for girl.\" \"But when Laura say she love me, then I begin to care for girl.\" The young man then informs his father and mother, and they approv\u00ad ing, together with other family friends, make up the bundle-of-purchase. It may be a horse. If so, it is led by one of his friends and tied by the tent of the girl's parents. Or guns and blankets are contributed, which are carried by an aunt or other female relative, and the load is laid down at the tent door. It is \"wo-lipa-pi,\" laying down, and the young man thus lays down or tenders his offer for the girl. If this is not satisfactory, either from the small amount or the character of the young man, the offerings are carried back, and the young folks have a chance to elope, unless they are restrained by higher considerations. Sometimes it happens that a young man wants a girl, and her friends are also quite willing, while she alone is unwilling. The purchase bundle is desired by her friends, and hence compulsion is resorted to. The girl yields and goes to be his slave, or she holds out stoutly, sometimes taking her own life as the alternative. Several cases of this kind have come to the personal knowledge of the writer. The legends of Winona and Black Day Woman are standing testimonies. The comely dark-eyed Winona wanted to wed the successful hunter, but the brilliant warrior was forced upon her, and therefore she leaped from the crag on Lake Pepin, which immortalizes her name. For a like reason, Black-Day Woman pushed her canoe out into the current, above the Falls of Saint Anthony, and sang her death song as it passed over. These are doubtless historical events, except that the years are not known. When the offer is accepted the girl is taken by some relative to the tent of the buyer. In the olden time it is said the custom was that she rode on the back of some female friend. Thus they become man and wife, with the idea of property strongly impressed upon the mind of the man. He has purchased her, as he would do a horse, and has he not a right to command her, and even to beat her? The customs of his people allow it.U:NTWKITTE;NT DAKOTA LAWS. 207 If she pleases him not, he may throw her away (ehpeya), for is she not his property? Nevertheless this was the honorable way for a girl to be taken. On many accounts it was better than to be stolen or taken unlawfully. And this custom of wife-purchase maintains its hold upon the Dakota people until they have made much progress in civilization. The difference in the pronouns used in.my wife and my husband seems to mark the difference of the property idea. Two kinds of possession are indicated by the affixed possessive pronouns, one easily alienated, as in \"mita-surjke,\" my horse; and the other not transferable, as in \"mi-nape,\" my hand. The man uses the first form, where possession sits lightly, as \"mitawin;\" while the woman uses the other, \"mihihna.\" 1 But it must not be inferred from this that a Dakota woman does not often run away from her husband. In. -that case, unless he endeavors to win her back, the laws of his nation allow him to cut off her nose, or otherwise mutilate her for infidelity. THE BABY, The young- father is away on purpose. He has gone to his own father's people, or perhaps on a hunt with his comrades. The mother is left with the older women, her own mother and other female relatives. Many of the middle-aged women become skillful mid-wives; and the Dakota women, who are healthy, have less labor at such times than women in more civilized communities. The baby is born, and, like the infant Saviour of the world, is wrapped in swaddling bands. \"Hoksi\" appears to be the root form of \"ho-ksi-iia,\" boy;2 and hence to the \"hoksi\" is added \"iyokopa,\" the board to wliicli the child is bound, and we have the long descriptive name for \"baby,\" \"hoksiyokopa,\" and sometimes \"hoksiyopa\" and \"hoksicopa.\" This board is shaved out nicely, and often ornamented in various ways, with beads and quills, having a stay board around the 'This is another instance of the necessity of observing great cautiou in the analysis of Indian words. Mitawii) hardly falls in the category to which mitasunke belongs. It is better, for several reasons, not to lay too much stress upon the derivation of mitawirj from mita, my, and win, woman. (1) We should consider all the persons of each kinship term in any one language. (2) We should compare the Dakota terms with the corresponding ones in cognate languages.

In this nicely arranged cradle, which is often hung up in the daytime, the baby has his home for the most part, being taken out .at night, and at other times when needing care. So it grows, crying sometimes as other babies do, but needing and receiving much less care than a civilized child. In the meantime the mother lias, perhaps on the first day, or if not on that day very soon after, gone to the stream or lake and washed away her unclean- ness. If it is winter she cuts a hole in the ice to do it. When they begin to take 011 civilized habits, the Dakota women find they can not continue to follow the customs of their grandmothers. What will they call the baby0? If it be a little girl, and is the first born, then it inherits the beautiful name of Winona. When the second child comes, if that is a girl, it is called uHa'-parj;\" the third, \"Ha'-pi- stiijna;\" the fourth, \"Warjske;\" and the fifth, \"Wi-hakeV Some of these names are said not to be used by the Sioux on the Missouri. On the other hand, if the first born is a boy, his inherited .name is \"Caske,\" and the second child, if a boy, will be called \"He-parj;\" and the third, \"He-pi;\" and the fourth, Ca-tarj;\" and the fifth, \"Ha-ke.\" Some children have no other names given them, and wear these alone when they are grown up. But if all families were content with this limited circle, much confusion would exist, especially as they have no family name. Hence the necessity of giving other names. This is done often by the father, and sometimes by some relative of consideration. Frequently a feast is made by the father to mark the occasion, and the child's ears are bored that it may wear ornaments. Girls'names generally terminate in \"wirj\" or \"wirjna,\" but not always. I recall a family of girls who were named \"Arjpao,\" Morning, \" Ahiyarjke- wirj,\" Woman Come-to-stay, aMa?ipi-wirjna,''C7<wrf Woman, \"Haijyetu-ku-wirj,\" Coming Night Woman, etc. But the boys, either in their childhood or when they are grown, receive the imposing and honorable names of ancestors, as, Gray Bear, Standing Buffalo, Standing Soldier, The Orphan, Burning Earth, etc. Oftentimes new names are given when young men signalize themselves in war or otherwise. Then there is feasting, music, and dancing. CHILD LIFE. The children have now come into the family. How will they grow up? What shall they be taught? Who shall be their teachers? What theTJNWEITTEtf DAKOTA LAWS. 209 father and mother do they will do. What the father and mother know they will know. What the father and mother are they will be. One can hardly say there is much 'government in a Dakota family. Children are scolded often, they are pushed, or shoved, or shaken sometimes, and they are whipped rarely. They are petted and indulged a good deal, but not more than children in civilized lands. But somehow or other, with exceptions, they manage to grow up affectionate and kind, the pride of -father and mother. The love of the parents has wrought this. Not unfrequently the grandfather and grandmother are the principal teachers. TRAINING OF THE BOY. The old man sits in the tipi and shaves out a bow and arrow for the little boy. In the mean time he tells him stories of history and war. The boy's father, it may be, has been killed by the enemy. The grandfather tells the story over and over again. It burns itself into the boy's heart. It becomes the animus of his life. He shoots his first bird and brings it into.the tent. He is praised for that. \"When you become a man you must kill an enemy,\" the old man says. \" Yes; I will kill an enemy,\" is the boy's reply. He dreams over it. ^ He witnesses the \"Scalp Dance\" and the \"No Flight Dance\" in his village. His heart is growing strong. When lie is fifteen or sixteen he joins the first war party and comes back with an eagle feather in his head, if so be he is not killed and scalped by the enencv. All this is education. Then there are foot racings, and horse racings, and ball playing, and duck hunting, and deer hunting, or it may be the whole village goes on a buffalo chase. These are the schools in which the Dakota boy is educated. In the long winter evenings, while the fire burns brightly in the center of the lodge and the men are gathered in to smoke, he hears the folk lore and legends of his people from the lips of the older men. He learns to sing the love songs and the war songs of the generations gone by. There is no new path for him to tread, but he follows in the old ways. He becomes a Dakota of the Dakota. His armor is consecrated by sacrifices and offerings and vows. He sacrifices and prays to the stone god, and learns to hold up the pipe to the so-called Great Spirit. He is killed and made alive again, and thus is initiated into the mysteries and promises of the Mystery Dance, He becomes a successful hunter and warrior, and what he does not know is not worth knowing for a Dakota. His education is finished. If he has 7105 VOL ix 14210 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. not already done it, he can now demand the hand of one of the beautiful maidens of the village. TRAINING OF THE GIRL,. Under the special care and tuition of the mother and grandmother and other female relatives the little girl grows up into the performance of the duties of tent life. She plays with her \"made child,\" or doll, just as children in other lands do. Very soon she learns to take care of the baby; to watch over it in the lodge, or carry it on her back, while the mother is away for wood or dressing buffalo robes. Little girl as she is, she is sent to the brook or lake for water. She has her little workbag with awl and sinew, and learns to make small moccasins as her mother makes large ones. Some\u00ad times she goes with her mother to the wood and brings home her little bun\u00ad dle of sticks. When the camp moves she has her small pack as her mother carries the larger one, and this pack is sure to grow larger as her years in\u00ad crease. When the corn is planting, the little girl has her part to perform. If she can not use the hoe yet, she can at least gather off the old cornstalks. Then the garden is to be watched while the god-given maize is growing. And when the harvesting comes, the little girl is glad for the corn roasting. So she grows. She learns to work with <beads and porcupine quills and to embroider with ribbons. She becomes skilled in the use of vermilion and other paints. A stripe of red adorns her hair and red and yellow spots are over her eyebrows and on her cheeks. Her \"instincts teach her the arts of personal adornment. She puts cheap rings on her fingers and tin dangles in her ears and strands of beads around her neck. Quite likely a young man comes around and adds to her charms as he sings: Wear this, I say; Wear this, I -say; Wear this, I sa,y; This little finger ring, Wear this, I say. Thus our Dakota girl becomes skilled in the art of attracting the young men, while she is ambitious in the line of carrying bundles as well as in cooking venison. In all these ways she is educated to be a woman among Dakota women. It is a hard lot and a hard life, but she knows no other. WHEN DEATH COMES. In the wild life of the Dakota the birth rate exceeded the death rate. So that, without doubt, notwithstanding famines sometimes and pestilencesUN WRITTEN DAKOTA LAWS. 211 and wars, the Dakota nation has increased for the last two hundred years. This has bean proved true within the last few decades at villages where actual count has been made. But in their entering upon the habits and environments of civilization, it is usually found that a wave of death goes over the people. They do not know how to live in the changed conditions, and the death rate is fearfully increased. \" We die, we all die, we are con\u00ad sumed with dying,\" is the sad refrain of many a Dakota family. Living much in the outdoors and within airy tipis, and subsisting on wild meats and such roots and fruits as they could gather, the children us-ually lived. But, nevertheless, even then death came. The baby in the mother's arms or strapped to her back sickened; or the little boy or girl occasionally succumbed under the hardships and privations; or the mother was taken with insidious consumption. The young father, it may be, ran too long and hard after that deer; he never ran again, but sickened and died. Then the old and the blind and the lame passed away, because they had reached the limits of life. So death comes to Indian tipis as to white men's hovels and palaces. But it is 110 more welcome in the one case than in the other. The Dakota mother loves her infant as well as the white woman her baby. When the spirit takes its flight-a wild howl goes up from the tent. The baby form is then wrapped in the best buffalo calf\u00ad skin or the nicest red blanket and laid away on a scaffold or on the branch of some tree. Thither the mother goes with disheveled hair and the oldest clothes of sorrow for she has given away the better ones and wails out her anguish, in the twilight, often abiding out far into the cold night The nice kettle of hominy is prepared and carried to the place where the spirit is supposed to hover still. When it has remained sufficiently long for the wanao-i to inhale the ambrosia, the little children of the village are invitedO ' O to eat up the remainder. But let us take another case. A young man is lying sick in yonder tent. He has been the best hunter in the village. Many a time he has come in carrying one, two, or more deer on his back, and has been met and relieved of his burden by his wife or mother. The old men have praised him as swifter than the antelope, while they have feasted on his venison. But now some spirit of wolf or bear has come into him and caused this sickness. The doctors of the village or conjurers are tried, one after another. The blankets, the gun, and the horse have all been given to secure the best skill; but it is all in vain; the hunter dies. The last act of the conjurer is to sing a song to conduct the spirit over the wanagi212 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. tacanku, the spirit's road, as the milky way is called. The friends are in\u00ad consolable. They give away their good clothes, and go into mourning with ragged clothes and bare feet, and ashes oil their heads. Both within the lodge and without there is a great wailing. Micirjksi, micirjksi, my son, my son, is the lamentation in Dakota land, as it was in the land of Israel. The departed is wrapped in the most beautifully painted buffalo robe or the newest red or blue blanket. Dakota custom does not keep the dead long in the tipi. Young men are called and feasted, whose duty it is to carry it away and place it on a- scaffold, or, as in more recent times, to bury it. The custom of burial, however, soon after death was not the Dakota custom. It would interfere with their idea that the spirit had not yet bidden a final farewell to the body. Therefore the laying up on a scaffold which was erected on some mound, where it would have a good view of the surrounding country. After a while the bones could be gathered up and buried in the mound and an additional quantity of earth carried up to cover it. This is partly the explanation of burial mounds made since the period of the mound-builders. Thus the lodge is made desolate. It must be taken down and pitched in a new place. The young wife cries and cuts her flesh. The mother and other female relatives wail out their heart sadness on the night air. The father, the old man, leans more heavily on his staff as he goes on to the time of his departure. The brothers or cousins are seen wending their way, in the afternoon, to the place of the dead, to lay down a brace of ducks and to offer a prayer. A near relative makes up a war party. The feathers and other ornament, together with the clothing of the young man, are taken by this company on the warpath and divided among themselves in the country of their enemies. This is honoring the dead. If they suc\u00ad ceed in bringing home scalps their sorrow is turned into joy. For will not this make glad the spirit of the departed? So, then, this will be gladness to the dead and glory to the living. The young men and maidens dance around the war trophies until the leaves come out in the spring or until they fall off in the autumn.1 THE SPIRIT-WORLD. If sorrow brings mankind into a common kinship, a white man may understand something of an Indian's feelings as he stands by the side of his 'For Teton burial customs, etc., see \"Teton Folk-lore,\" translated by the editor and published in the Amer. Anthropologist for April, 1889, pp. 144-148. J. o. t>.UNWB1TTEN DAKOTA LAWS. 213 dead and looks over into the land of spirits. What has gone? And whither has it gone*? The belief of the Dakotas in the existence of spirit is deeply inwrought into their language. The \"nagi,\" or shadow, in the concrete form, meaning primarily the shade or shadow made by any material thing in the sunlight, is used to indicate the human soul or spirit, as well as the spirit of all living beings. It is, moreover, put into the abstract form as \"wanagi,\" and also into the human absolute, \"wica-nagi,\" human spirit They speak also of the \"wanagi tipi,\" house of spirits, and say of one who has died, \"wanagiyata iyaya,\" gone to the spirit land. And the road over which it passes is called \"wanagi tacarjku,\" spirit's path. . The war prophet also, in his incantations, sings: I have cast in here a soul; I have cast in here a soul; Lhave cast in here a buffalo soul; I have cast in here a soul. In the sacred language of conjuring man is designated by the \"mythic buffalo.\" Thus we have abundant evidence, in the language and customs of the people, of the common belief of the nation in the existence of spirits. But having said that, there is little more that can be said. The vista is dark. No light shines upon the path. But looking out into this dark avenue, the sad heart of the Dakota sings a song for the dead. Take this mourning song of Black-Boy for his grandson as a specimen. The object appears to be that of introducing the freed spirit of the child to his comrades in the world of spirits. \"The unearthliness of the scene,\" says Mr. Pond, \"can not be de\u00ad scribed, as, in the twilight of the morning, while the mother of the deceased boy, whose name was Makadutawirj, Red-Earth- Woman, was wailing in a manner which would excite the sympathies of the hardest heart, Hoksidarj- sapa, Black-boy, standing on the brow of a hill, addressed himself to the ghostly inhabitants of the spirit-world, in ghostly notes, as follows: \"Friend, pause and look this way; Friend, pause and look this way; Friend, pause and look this way; Say ye, A grandson of Black-boy is coming.\"CHAPTER V. THE SUPERHUMAN. The existence of spirits and the necessity for the superhuman are facts fully recognized by the Dakotas. The unknown and unknowable form a broad belt in which humbuggery can be practiced by the Dakotas as well as other nations. The pOAvers are evil. The lightning strikes suddenly and kills. The thunder god is angry and merciless. The north god sweeps down upon them with terrible snow storms, and buries their encampments, killing their ponies, and making buffalo hunting impossible. Or in the spring floods, the Unktehi, or god of the waters, is malignant and kills now and then a man or a child. And all through the year the demon spirits of the wolf and the bear and the lynx and the owl and the snake are doing their mischievous work, scattering disease and death everywhere. Who shall cope with these evil-minded powers'? How shall deliverance come to the people*? Will not fasting and praying and self-inflicted suffer\u00ad ing bring the needed power? To the Dakota thought this is surely among the possibilities. Hence, naturally, grows up the ivakay man, or the so- called \"medicine man.\" His applied, power and skill are denominated reneiving or fixing over \"wapiyapi;\" and the man is called a reneiver. He works rather by magic than by medicine. His singing, and rattling the gourd shell, and sucking the place where the pain is, are all for the purpose of driving out the evil spirits. It is a battle of spirits. The greater a man's spirit power is the more successful he is as a doctor. And the secret of spirit power is the alliance with other spirits. Hence the efficacy of fasting and praying. Praying is \" cry ing to.\" Hence also the augmented power obtained in the Sun Dance. The singing, the back cuttings, the thongs, the buffalo head, the dancing unto entire exhaustion, all these bring one into the realm of the spirits. Also the experiences in passing through the death and the resurrection of the Mystery Dance must bring added super\u00ad human power. Still more, the vision seeking, the fasting, the prayer to the night winds, the standing on a mound where men have been buried, or getting down into a hole nearer the bones, this will surely bring comniuni- 214THE SUPERHUMAN. 215 cations from the spirit world. Thus, armed by all these experiences and aids, the man becomes a wicasta wakarj indeed, a man of mystery, a healer of diseases, a war-prophet and a leader on the war-path. The conjuring, the powwowing, that is, the magic of the healing art, may always have called to its aid, in some small degree, a knowledge and use of barks and roots and herbs. But as the magic declined the use of roots and medicines increased, so that the doctor comes to be designated Pezihuta wicasta, the Grass Root Man. As the knowledge of letters and Christianity have come in, their faith in vision seeking and necromancy has been undermined and the power, they say, has departed. The Dakota beliefs in regard to diseases, and the common way of treating them, as well as the progress of thought, and change of practice, consequent upon the introduction of Christianity, will be well illustrated in the following sketch of a full blood Dakota man, who was a member of the Presbyterian General Assembly of 1880, and who before that body made a speech on Indian rights in the capitol of Wisconsin. EHNA-MANI. The \"One who walks through,\" as his name means, is now a man of fifty winters or more and the pastor of the Pilgrim Church at the Sa'ntee Agency, in Knox County, Nebraska. He was born at Red Wing on on the Mississippi, which place the Dakotas called He-mini-carj liill- water-ivood thus finely describing the. hill, standing so close to the water, with its river side covered with trees. At his baptism Ehna-mani was called Artemas. Tall and athletic, en\u00ad ergetic and swift of foot, as a young man, he appears to have made his mark on the war path, in the deer hunt, on the ball ground, and in the dancing1 circles. Even now he can. sing more Dakota songs of love, war songs, and songs .of the sacred mysteries, than any other man I have seen. During last summer I journeyed with Artemas and others, on horseback, many hundred miles up the Missouri River, and across to Fort Wadsworth and Minnesota, and often beguiled the tedious prairie rides with listening to these songs, hearing' his explanation of the enigmatical words, and then stopping my pony to note them down. Because of the light that came through the increasing intercourse of the Dakotas with white people, the father of Artemas was afraid\" he might be induced to forsake the religion of his ancestors, and so made him promise that, while he had his children educated in the civilization and216 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. Christianity brought to them by the missionaries, he himself would be true to his ancestral faith. Under all ordinary providences,'Artemas thinks he should have so lived and died. But when the trouble came in 1862, he found himself at the ferry, without gun or war-club, when Captain Marsh's nien were fired upon and nearly half of them killed, and because he too was wounded there, he was imprisoned. This change of circumstances produced a change of life. With the younger men he learned to read and write, became a Christian, and was elected elder or leader of the Red Wing class, while in prison at Davenport, Iowa. This place he filled with great credit to himself and profit to others. It was during the last winter of their imprisonment that the question of conjuring came before them in its moral and 'religious aspects. Will Christianity grapple successfully with the customs of the fathers? Will it modify or abolish this system of Dakota conjuring ? Among all the nations of men disease and death are common. Heathens die as fast as Christians, perhaps faster. And when sickness comes into a family it would be inhuman not to make some efforts to alleviate and cure. This feeling belongs to our humanity. It is greatly influenced and shaped, but not created, by the Christian religion. Among the Dakotas, and probably all Indian tribes, the method of treating the sick is that known to us as powwowing or conjuring. Disease, they say, comes from \"the spirit world. The gods are offended by acts of omission or commission, and the result is that some spirit of animal, bird, or reptile is sent, by way of punishment, and the man is taken sick. The process of recovering must accord with the theory of disease. It will not be met by roots and herbs, but by incantations. Hence the Indian doctor must be a wakarj man; that is, he must be inhabited by spiritual power which will enable him to deliver others from the power of spirits. The process includes chants and prayers and the rattling of the sacred gourd shell. From the commencement of the Dakota mission we had never taken any fancy to powwowing. It seemed to us that such terrible screeching, groaning, singing, rattling, and sucking would make a well man sick rather than a sick man well. This was education. An Indian did not think so. But, soberly, we thought it was not a civilized and Christian way of ap\u00ad proaching a sick person.THE SUPERHUMAN. 217 We had also an opinion about it as wrong and wicked thus to come in contact with the evil spirits over the suffering body of one sick. Hence Dr. Williamson always refused to practice medicine in a case where the conjurer was also employed. And it had been generally understood that we regarded the Dakota method of treating the sick as inconsistent with a profession of Christianity. Still tfte question could not be considered as settled. In October of 1865 it came up for discussion and settlement in the prison on this wise: During the previous summer, when no missionary was with them, a iiiimber of men had yielded to various temptations. Some had drunk beef, and perhaps something stronger, to an extent that they could hardly be sober. Some had been persuaded and hired by white men to dance an Indian dance, and others had either powwowed or been the subjects of the powwow. In the adjustment of these cases, one man admitted that he had prac\u00ad ticed as a Dakota conjurer, and claimed that it was right. His fathers practiced in this way, and were often successful in healing the sick. He grew up in this system of doctoring, and had also practiced it with success. He was not skilled in any other mode of treating disease. The white people had their medicine men. No one was willing to see a friend die without making some efforts to prolong his life. It was merciful, it was right. Jesus Christ when on earth healed the sick and cast out devils. Besides, they the prisoners were in peculiar circumstances. More than one hundred had died since their first imprisonment. And the white doctor, who was appointed to treat thjsir sick, cared not whether they died or lived. Indeed, they thought he would rather have them die. When a good many of them were sick and dying with smallpox, he had been heard to say that his Dakota patients were doing very well! Thus they were under the necessity of endeavoring to heal their own sick, by the only method in which they were skillful. This was the argument. The missionary would not decide the case, but referred it to the elders Ehiiamani and his brethren. After two weeks they signified that they were prepared to give their decision. When they were come together for this purpose, they were told that the Grospel of Christ molded the cus\u00ad toms and habits of every people by whom it was received. There might be some wrong things in a national custom which could be eliminated, and the custom substantially retained. Or the custom might be so radically absurd and wrong, that it could not be redeemed. In that case, Christian-218 DAKOTA GBAMMAK, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. ity required its abandonment. It was for them, with their knowledge of the teachings of the Bible, and the requirements of Christ's religion, to decide on the character of this custom of their fathers. There were twelve elders. Very deliberately each one arose and stated his opinion. Two thought the circumstances were such that they could not altogether give up this, their ancestral method of curing disease. They were shut up to it. But Artemas and nine others agreed in saying that the practice of conjuring was wrong, and inconsistent with a profession of the Christian religion. They said the notion entertained by the Dakotas, that disease was caused by spirits, they believed to be erroneous; that sickness and death, they now understand, come not out of the ground, but by the appointment of the Great Spirit; and that the system of conjuring brings men into contact with the evil spirits and tends to lead them away from Christ. This decision was regarded as a finality in the prison on that point and is accepted throughout the mission churches. When the prisoners were released, Artemas met his wife and family with great gladness of heart; and as soon thereafter as possible he was married according to the Christian form. For he said that, when a heathen he thought she was his wife, but the Bible had taught him that he had not truly taken her. A few months after this he was licensed to preach the gospel, and in the next year was ordained as one of the pastors of the Pilgrim church. In the autumn of 1868, he attended a large gathering of ministers at Min\u00ad neapolis, and was cordially received by all classes'of Christians. The Congregational and Methodist Sunday Schools were entertained with the story of his turning from the warpath to the \"strait and narrow way;\" and from seeking after a chaplet of eagle's feathers as the reward of prowess on the battlefield, to his reaching forth for the prize of the high calling in Christ even the crown of Life.CHAPTER VI. ARMOR AND EAGLE'S FEATHERS. For more than two hundred years we know that the Dakota have been noted as the most warlike nation of the northwest. Hennepm and his comrades were captured by a flotilla of canoes coming down to make war on the Illini and Miami of Illinois. And the reputation of good fighters has come down to recent times, as we know from the Ouster massacre. The making and keeping them a nation of warriors has, in my judgment, been accomplished mainly by three customs, viz: The scalp dance, the wearing of eagle's feathers, and consecrated armor. In their natural order the last comes first. In the ancient times the exhortation to a young man was, \"Gruard well your sacred armor;\" and that consisted of the spear, an arrow, and a bundle of paint, with some swan's down painted red, to which were sometimes added some roots for the healing of wounds. These were wrapped together in strips of red or blue cloth, and could be seen in pleasant days carefully set up outside of the lodge. These were given by an older man, who was believed to have power over spirits, and who had, in the act of consecra\u00ad tion, made to inhere in them the spirit of some animal or bird, as the wolf, the beaver, the loon, or the eagle. Henceforth these, or rather the one which became each one's tutelar divinity and his armor god, were sacred and not to be killed or eaten until certain conditions were fulfilled. Cer\u00ad tain customs of this kind are finely illustrated in the following personal narrative ofSIMON ANAWANG-MANI. Simon was all that a Dakota. brave could be. In his early years he must have been daring even to recklessness. There was in him a strong will, which sometimes showed itself in the form of stubbornness. His eye, even in a later day, showed that there had been evil, hatred, and malicious\u00ad ness there He was a thorough Indian, and for the first dozen years of his manhood, or from his eighteenth to his .thirtieth year, no one of his com- 219220 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. rades had followed the warpath more, or reaped more glory on it, than he had. None had a right to wear so many eagle's feathers; no other one was so much honored. Dakota war-honors are distributed in this manner: A party of young men have gone on the warpath against the Ojibwa. They find a man and kill him. Five braves may share this honor and be entitled therefor to wear each a feather of the royal eagle. The one who shoots the enemy is one of the five, but is not the chief. He who runs up and first plunges his battle-ax or scalping knife into the foe is counted the first. Then others may come up and strike him and be partakers of the glory. Each wears for that act an eagle's feather. If it is only a woman that is killed and scalped, the mark of honor is only a common eagle's feather. There is another distinction worth noting. The only real punishment existing among the Dakota, having the sanction of law or immemorial usage comes under the name of u soldier-killing.\" This is carrying out the decrees of the braves or warriors. The shape it takes is the destruction of property, cutting up blankets or tents, breaking guns, or killing horses. But the same immemorial custom places an estoppage on this power. A man who has killed more enemies than anyone else in the camp can not be \"soldier-killed\" by anyone else. Or if he has killed an enemy in more difficult circumstances than the others, as, for instance, if he has climbed a tree to kill one, and no other man has performed a like feat, no one has a right to execute on him any decree of the \"Soldiers' lodge.\" In this way he is placed above the execution of law. To this eminence Simon had risen. By the customs of the nation no one in that part of the country had a right to publicly cut up his blanket or tent, or break his gun, or kill his horse. This was surely an honorable distinction Another custom prevails among the Dakota which may be mentioned in connection with Simon. The reception of the wo-ta-we, or armor, by the young man places him under certain pledges which he must, if possible, redeem in afterlife. It taboos or consecrates certain parts of an animal, as the heart, the liver, the breast, the wing, etc. Whatever part or parts are tabooed to him he may not eat until by killing an enemy he has removed the taboo. Simon had removed all taboos, and in this respect was a free man. His armor was purified and made sacred by the blood of his enemies. His manhood was established beyond all dispute. All things were lawful for him.ARMOR AND EAGLE'S FEATHEES. 221 This Dakota name, Anawarjg-mani, means \"One who walks1 gallop\u00ad ing upon.\" It may have had its significance. It may have been given after his war exploits, and had reference to the fury with which he rushed upon the foe. This is a common thing. Young men distinguish themselves on the warpath, and come home with the scalps of their enemies. Their boy-names are thrown away and new names given to them. And so the giving and receiving of a new name was not among them a new or strange thing. It was a mark of distinction. Hence the desire that all had, when making a profession of the Christian religion, to have new names Christian names given them. They were to be new people. There was a fitness in it, for Christ had said, \"I will write upon him my new name.\" At his baptism the \"One who walks galloping upon'1 was called Simon, and by that name he is extensively known among white people and Indians. He learned to read and write in the first years of the mission at Lac-qui- parle, though he never became as good a scholar as many others, and he became a convert to Christianity about the beginning of the year 1840. The energy and independence which had characterized him on the hunt and the warpath he carried with him into his new relations. By dressing like a white man and going to work, he showed his faith by his works. This was all contrary to the customs of his people, and very soon, brought on him a storm of opposition. He built for himself a cabin, and fenced a field and planted it. For this his wife's friends opposed and persecuted him. It is true, as already stated, no man in the village had more Dakota honors than he had. No one had taken more Ojibwa scalps, and no one could cover his head with so many eagle feathers; and hence no one could \"soldier-kill\" him. But now he had cut off his hair and abjured his Dakota honors, and no one was found so poor as to do him reverence. As he passed through the village, going to his work, he was laughed at, and the children often said, \"There goes the man who has made himself a woman.\" The men who before had honored him as a Dakota brave now avoided him and called him no more to their feasts. But those forms of opposition he met bravely and was made stronger thereby. It happened that, about the beginning of the year 1844, Simon went down with his family to the then new mission station at Traverse des Sioux. While there he cut rails for the mission and taught as an assistant in the Dakota school. The Dakota men at this place, although even more openly opposed to the new religion than were those at Lac-qui-paiie, never- 'That is, continues. J. 0. D.222 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. theless pursued a very different course with Simon. They honored him and invited him to their dog feasts. They praised him; told him he was a good fellow; that he had taken many Ojibwa scalps, and so they wanted him to drink spirit water with them. How much Simon resisted the impor\u00ad tunities is not known. He fell. He was ashamed. He put off his white man's clothes and for some time was an Indian again. For several years his history in regard to fire water was one of sin\u00ad ning and repenting. Again and again he was drawn away. His appetite for spirit water would return, and the desire to obtain horses by trading in it led him farther astray So we mourned sadly over his fall. He repented and promised reformation only to fall again; and each time he appeared to go down, deeper than before. For years he seemed to work iniquity with greediness, Yet during all this time we had hope in his case. We often urged him to come back to the path of life; and something seemed to say, \" Simon will yet return.\" Sometimes we obtained from him a promise, and sometimes he came to church, but was so much ashamed that he could riot be persuaded to enter, but would sit down 011 the doorstep. Thus he came up gradually, getting more and more strength and courage. And so in 1854 he returned to the dress and customs of the white men and to his profession of love to Jesus Christ. Since that time he has witnessed a good confession before many witnesses as a ruling elder and class leader, and recently as a licensed local preacher. When the outbreak of 1862 occurred Simon, and his family were living in a brick house near the Hazelwood mission station. Subsequently Little Crow and the whole camp of hostile Indians removed up to that part of the country, and they forced the Christian Indians to leave their houses, which were all afterwards burned. While the hostile and loyal parties. were camped there near together on Rush Brook, Mrs. Newmaii, one of the cap\u00ad tives, and her three children, came to seek food and protection in Simon's tipi. She had been badly treated by her captors, and now cast off to go whither she could. She afterwards told me that she felt safe when she found herself and children in a family where they prayed and sang praise to the Great Spirit. Little Crow ordered the camp to be removed from the vicinity of Hazelwood up to the mouth of the Chippewa. At this time, when all had started, Simon fell behind, and leaving his own family to take care of them\u00ad selves, he and one of his sons placed Mrs. Newman and her children in aARMOR AND EAGLE'S FEATHERS. 223 little wagon and brought them safely down to Gen. Sibley's camp at Fort Ridgley. The bringing in of these and some others not only caused great glad\u00ad ness in our camp, but gave us hope that God would enable us to rescue the remaining captives. Indeed, this was to us the first certain knowledge of that counter revolution, which was brought about by the daring and energy of the Christian Indians. It was the lifting up of the dark cloud of almost despair that had for weeks been setting down .upon us.CHAPTER VII. DAKOTA DANCES. The function of the dance among- the Dakota may be stated as four\u00ad fold: First, amusement; secondly, gain; thirdly, superhuman help; and, fourthly, worship. Two or more of these objects may be combined in one dance, but usually one idea is predominant. In a purely heathen Dakota camp there is always a great deal of drumming, some by day and more by night. This is a kind of practice and preparation for more important occa\u00ad sions as well as a nightly amusement for the young men. All dances .have musical accompaniments. SINGING TO. There is one especially, which is called \"Adowan\" and \" Wadowan,\" that is, Singing to or over. This is a begging dance. Sometimes it is called \"Zitkadarj pa adowan,\" Singing over the heads of birds. A man gathers some beautiful woodpeckers' heads and sings over them to another person. They are a gift to that person, and, of course, the honorable deeds of that person are mentioned and his praises sung. In return a horse or something quite valuable is expected. It has been related to me that articles of clothing or other skins or curiously wrought pipes were, in years gone by, taken by the Dakota of Minnesota to the Missouri, and this cere\u00ad mony of singing over was practiced upon the heads of a man's children, who, in return for the honor, gave several horses. BEGGING DANCE. But the common begging dance, which was often seen among the eastern Dakota forty years ago, included a variety of fashionable dances, all of which were made for the purpose of begging. Sometimes it was called the buffalo dance, when the dancers made themselves look hideous by wearing the horns and long hair of that animal. Doubtless women alone could dance a begging dance, but all that I ever saw were of men alone. Dressed in their best clothes and painted in the most approved styles, with all their eagle's feathers properly arranged in their heads, the 224DAKOTA DANCES. 225 men collect and dance in a ring. Their bodies lean forward, and their knees are bent accordingly, and thus with a motion up and down, keeping time to the drum and the deer-hoof rattle, they dance and sing their almost monotonous songy concluding with a shout and the clapping of the mouth with the hand. Then some warrior steps out into the middle, and, with abundance of gesture, recites some war exploit. This is received with a shout, and the dance begins again. Presently, at one of these intervals, an old man, sitting outside, makes a speech in praise of the man or the people who are expected to make the presents. If the dance is made to a trader, he loses no time in sending out tobacco, or powder and lead, or pro\u00ad visions, or, it may be, all together. If one Indian village is dancing to another village, the women hasten to bring their presents of food and cloth\u00ad ing from the different lodges. Another dance of thanks is made, the pres\u00ad ents are distributed, and the party breaks up or goes elsewhere. Consider\u00ad ing that begging dances must be very demoralizing, white men have often been greatly to blame for encouraging- them. NO-FLIGHT DANCE. In the organization of an army and its preparation for effective service a large amount of drill is found necessary. Something very like this, in its objects, is resorted to by the Dakota war captain in preparing the young men and boys for the warpath. It is called the \"No flight dance.\"1 This gathers in the young men who have not yet made their mark on the battle field, and drills them by the concerted motions of the dance, while, by the recital of brave deeds, their hearts are fired and made firm for the day of battle. The instructions given are lessons in Indian warfare. . All this is preparatory to the war prophet's organizing a party for the warpath. But before starting he must propitiate the spirits of evil and obtain the help of the gods. This was sought for in a variety of ways, one of which was bv the \"Yumni Wacipi.\" or Circle dance. \u00ab/ J- ' emeu: DANCE. A preparation for this, and for god-seeking in general, was through the purification of the vapor bath or initipi. This finished, the wakar) man had a tent set for him, joined to which a circle was made of about forty feet in diameter, by setting sticks in the ground and wreathing them with willows. Four gateways were left. In the center stood a pole twenty 1 Nape sni kagapi, literally, They pretend not to flee, 7105 VOL ix 15226 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. feet high, with bark images suspended at the top. Near the foot of this the ground was scooped out and a small willow booth made over it. At the entrance to this was a fire of coals, a stone painted red, and a pipe. When everything- was thus prepared, and the night previous had been spent in drumming and fasting and praying, the old man came out of the tent, naked except a wisp of grass around his loins. He carried his drum and rattles. Before the painted stone he stood and trembling prayed, \" Grand\u00ad father have mercy on me!\" This done, he entered the little booth and commenced to sing and drum. The dancers then entered the circle and danced around, a dozen or more at once, and all fixed up in paint and feathers. Three or four women followed. The men sang and the women answered in a kind of chorus. This continued for ten minutes perhaps, and they retired for a rest. The dance was resumed again and again, each time with an increased frenzy. When the last act was finished several men who had guns shot the wolf image at the top of the pole, when the old man gave forth his oracle, and the dance was done. SCALP DANCE. When the spirits had been propitiated and the vision had appeared, the leader made up his party and started for the country of the enemy. We will suppose they have been successful, and have obtained one or more scalps. They come home in triumph. This is wakte-hdipi, having killed, they come home. But having killed enemies, they paint themselves black and let their hair hang down. Before reaching their village they sit down on some knoll and sing a war dirge to the souls they have disembodied, when they are met by some of their own people and stripped of their clothes, which is called wayuzapi or taking-all. And their blankets may be taken from them 011 each occasion of painting the scalps red, which ceremony is commonly performed four times. Then the scalp dance commences. It is a dance of self-glorification, as its name, \"Iwakicipi,\" seems to mean. A hoop 2 feet in diameter, more or less, with a handle several feet long, is prepared, on which the scalp is stretched. The young men gather together and arrange themselves in a semicircle; those who participated in taking the scalp are painted black, and the others are daubed with red or yellow paint, according to their fancy; and all dance to the beat of the drum. On the other side of the circle stand the women, arranged in line, one of whom carries the scalp of the enemy. The men sing their war chants and praise the bravery andDAKOTA DANCES. 227 success of those who have returned from the warpath, and the women, at intervals, sing an answering chorus. As with other nations a new song is often made for the occasion; but the old ones are not forgotten. This may serve as a sample: Something I've killed, and I lift up my voice; Something I've killed, and I lift up my voice; The northern buffalo I've killed, and I lift up my voice; Something I've killed, and I lift up my voice. The \"northern buffalo\" means a black bear; and the \"black bear\" means a man. The \"lifting up the voice\" is in mourning for the slain enemy. Night after night is the dance kept up by the young men and women, until the leaves fall, if commenced in the summer; or, if the scalp was brought home in the winter, until the leaves grow again. On each occasion of painting the scalp a whole day is spent dancing around it. And these days are high days days of making gifts, feasting, and general rejoicing. The influence of the scalp dance on the morality of the people is quite apparent. In. so loose a state of society as that of the Dakotas, such fre\u00ad quent and long-continued night meetings tend greatly to licentiousness. But the great wrong of the scalp dance consists in its being a crime against our common humanity. \"If thine enemy hunger feed him, and if he thirst give him drink.\" What a contrast is the spirit of those divine words with the spirit of the \"Iwakicipi.\" The eagle's feather and the scalp dance tended greatly to keep up the intertribal wars among the Indians. Since the \"circle dance\" and the \"scalp dance\" have become things of the past among our partly civilized Dakotas, what is called the \"grass dance\" has been revived. It is said to have derived its name from the custom, in ancient times, of dancing naked, or with only a wisp of grass about the loins. Only the men appeared in this nude state. It is a night dance, and regarded as extremely licentious, although now they are repre\u00ad sented as dancing in their Indian dress or even clothed as white men. MYSTERY DANCE.' This is a secret organization, which is entered through mysterious death and mysterious resurrection. As it appears to have been confined mainly to the eastern portion of the Dakota Nation, it is supposed to have been derived from some other Indians at 110 very remote date. The 'Wakaij wacipi. [See Mandan feast, p. 273, and Wacicka dance, pp. 342-6, 3d. Aim. Eept. of the Director Bur. Eth J. o. r>.]228 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. Dakota themselves, however, claim that it was communicated to them by the great Unktelii or god of the waters. It is a form of religion which has doubtless largely supplanted older forms of worship. The badge of the order is the \"wakarj\" sack, or sack of mystery. The great water god ordained that this should be the skin of the otter, raccoon, weasel, squirrel, loon, or a species of fish and of snakes. It should contain four kinds of medicine and represent fowls, quadrupeds, herbs, and trees. Thus grass roots, the bark of tree roots, swan's down, and buffalo hair are the symbols which are carefully preserved in the medicine sack. This combination is supposed to produce A charm of powerful trouble, Like a hellbroth, boil and bubble. Certain good rules, in the main, are laid down, which must govern the conduct of members of this organization: They must revere the \"wakan\" sack; they must honor all who belong to the dance; they must make many \" sacred feasts;\" they must not steal nor listen to slander, and the women must not have more than one husband. The rewards promised to those who faithfully performed the duties were honor from their fellow members, frequent invitations to feasts, abundance of fowl and venison, with supernatural aid to consume it, long life here with a crown, of silver hair, and a dish and spoon in the future life. After the proper instruction in the mysteries, the neophyte practiced watchings and fastings and was purified for four successive days by the vapor bath. Then came the great day of initiation. The ceremonies were public. A great deal of cooked provisions was prepared. At the sacred dance which I witnessed four decades ago, there were a half dozen large kettles of meat. The arrangements for the dance consisted of a large tent at one end, whose open front was extended by other tents stretched along the sides, making an oblong- with the outer end open. Along the sides of this inclosure sat the members, perhaps a hundred in number, each one having his or her \"sack of mystery.\" At a given signal from the officiat\u00ad ing old men, all arose and danced inward until they became a solid mass, when the process was reversed and all returned, to their seats. Near the close of the performance those who were to be initiated were shot by the \"sacks of mystery/ 7 and falling down they were covered with blankets. Then the mysterious bean or shell which they claimed had produced death was extracted by the same mysterious power of the sack of mystery, andDAKOTA DANCES. 229 the persons were restored to a new life. But this new life came only after the throes and the bitterness of death. Then he has a \"sack\" given.him, and is thenceforth a member of the order of the sacred mysteries. A necessary adjunct of the Wakarj-wacipi is the \"Wakarj-woharjpi,\" or Sacred Feast. This is made very frequently when there is a plenty of food in the village. Of course, as a general thing, only those are invited who belong to the order. Forty years ago I was honored with an invitation to one of their feasts, in a wild Tetoii village at Fort Pierre on the Missouri. It is in part a worship. The pipe is lighted and held up to the gods with a prayer for mercy. Then they smoke around, after which the food is dished out. The guests bring their own wooden bowl and horn spoon. Each one must eat up all that is given him or pay a forfeit. This is a blanket or gun or such article as the person can give. I have known a community, in time of plenty, rim wild over the idea of stuffing each other and getting all the forfeits possible. Their god is their belly. Quite likely there are other forms of the dance in other parts of the Dakota country, or dances which have other names than those spoken of here; but these are sufficient There remains, however, to be mentioned the greatest exemplification of self-sacrifice and worship in the sun-dance. SUN-DANCE. The following graphic account of the sun-dance held in June, 1880, by the Tetoii under Red Cloud, is an abstract of what was published in the Daily Journal of Sioux City, Iowa. It is a very trustworthy and more than usually vivid description of a ceremony which is becoming rarer under the influence of Christianity. This sun-dance began at 5 a. m., June 24, 1880. The lodges, 700 in number, were arranged in a circle of about six miles in circumference 011 a level plain near White Clay Creek, Nebraska. The dance began with a grand charge within the circle. It is estimated that about 4,000 men and women took part in the charge. Nearly all were on horse\u00ad back, and they charged back and forth over the ground, yelling for ah hour, for the alleged purpose of frightening away the ghosts and ba,d spirits from the grounds. A hard rain set in at 6 o'clock, and nothing more was done until 1 o'clock, when the sky cleared and the people went up on a branch of White Clay Creek to cut the sacred pole. Around the tree to be felled a ring was formed, and 110 living object was allowed to enter therein except the persons who took part in felling the tree. The master'230 t)AKOTA GRAMMAE, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. of ceremonies was a colored man, captured when a child, and at the time of this dance attached to the band of Little Wound. It was his duty to keep intruders out of the circle. After much ceremony, dancing, and giving away of horses, six men walked slowly up to the tree and each gave it a hack, after which it was felled by the wife of Spider. When it went down a charge was made on it, and the tree, branches and all, was taken up and carried by men and women to the sun-dance grounds, a distance of two miles. On reaching the grounds, they made another charge to drive away any ghosts that might be lingering there. Then Tasurjke kokipapi, 1 the younger (commonly called Young-Maii-Afraid-of-his-Horses), announced that there was nothing more to be seen till 10 o'clock on the following day, Friday, June 25. The evening of the 24th and the forenoon of the 25th were spent in raising the pole and erecting a tabernacle. The latter was formed in a circle of about 500 yards in circumference, 12 feet high, and was con\u00ad structed by putting posts in the ground and covering them with greeri boughs. The pole was placed in the center and decorated with red, white, and blue flags, said to be gifts to the Great Spirit. There were within the inclosure about 1,000 men sitting around, and 300 dancers, besides 25 men riding their horses around the ring. The 300 dancers marched around the pole, dancing, singing, and shooting up at the pole. Each man had from one to three belts of cartridges strung around his body. He had little clothing besides his breecheloth, and his bare body and limbs were painted in various colors. This performance lasted for two hours, then all firing- ceased, and twenty children entered the ring to have their ears pierced. The parents of each child gave away two horses to the poor. When a horse was turned loose, the first man who caught hold of it owned it. Persons competing for the horses were placed outside the gate of the inclosure in two parallel rows 30 feet apart, one row on each side of the road. When a horse was turned out there was a scramble to see who could reach it first. The child to be honored was laid by its mother on a pile of new calico. Then six okl men sprinkled water on its head, repeating the fol\u00ad lowing words: \"O Wakaijtarjka, hear me! this man has been a good and brave man, and the mother is a good woman. For their sake let this child live long, have good luck and many children.\" Then, with a long, slender, sharp-pointed knife,, two holes were made through each ear, wherein were 'Literally, They (the foe) fear even his horse. j. o. D.DAltOTA BANCES. 231 placed rings of German silver. When all the children had had their ears pierced, ten men placed by the pole the skull of some large animal, crying over it and making sundry passes. Then all the young unmarried maidens who had obeyed their parents and had been chaste during the year went up and touched the tree, raised their right hands to the sun, bowed to the skull, and then retired from the inclosure. The young women had been told that if any of them had been unchaste the touching of the tree would insure fatal consequences to them, as the large animal represented by the skull would carry them off to the spirit land. At 8 o'clock the sun-dancers proper, seventeen in number, entered the ring. These men had been fasting, no food or water having been given them for three days and nights previous to their entering the inclosure. Men who take part in this daiice say what they are going to do before they are placed on record i. e., they intend going one, two, or more days with\u00ad out food and water, and whether they intend being cut and tied up to the pole. After making such a declaration they lose all control of their own wills. They are obliged to fast, and are placed on buffalo robes in a sweat- house until they- become as gaunt as grayhounds. In this condition were the seventeen brought into the ring by guards, and each one had a whistle placed in his mouth and a banner with a long staff placed in his hand. Then ten large bass drums, beaten by sixty men, struck up a hideous noise, the seventeen men danced, whistled, gazed steadily at the sun, and kept time with the drums. This scene was kept up. with little or no change until the morning of the third day. The white visitors reached the grounds at 10 a. m. Saturday, the 26th. The same noise was there, and the seventeen were still dancing and whist\u00ad ling. The clubs used as drumsticks had horses' tails fastened to them instead of the scalps which would have been used in earlier days. At 11 a. m. seven of the seventeen were laid down on blankets, and after much ceremony and giving away of horses and calico, each man was cut and tied up to the pole. This operation was performed by raising the skin of the right breast and then that of the left, cutting a hole about an inch long- through the skin at each place. A round wooden skewer was inserted through each hole, fastened by sinews, the sinews tied to a rope, and the rope to the pole. One fellow had pins inserted in each arm, tied with sinews, and fastened to a horse which was standing beside him. The first and second dancers seemed to be veterans,' as they ^vent forward to the pole, made a short prayer, and then ran backward, breaking loose and fall-232 DAKOTA GRAMMAR, TEXTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHY. ing flat on their backs. The third man, seeing the others break loose, took courage, braced up, and made a desperate struggle. He succeeded not only in breaking from the pole, but also from the horse. This feat pleased the Indians, who shouted lustily. Little Big Man, who was mounted, was so delighted that he shot an arrow straight up into the air, whooping with all his might. The arrow came down on the back of a large fat woman, who was standing outside the inclosure. The old woman jumped up and ran howling across the prairie. An Indian on the outside happened to be on horseback, so he ran up to her and held her while the others extracted the arrow. Little Big- Man was obliged to part Avith three horses to satisfy the woman. The four remaining dancers were young and inexperienced, so they could not break their bonds.. Consequently they gave away three horses each and were cut loose. One of them fainted, and on being resuscitated he became unruly, making a break from the ring, tumbling over several women, and when finally -seized he was standing among several infants that had been stowed away under blankers in the corner of the lodge. He was brought back, a whistle made of an eagle's feather was put into his mouth, and he was set to dancing. Then an old man with a looking-glass in his hand and a buffalo skull on his head performed mystery rites over him, to drive out the evil spirit Avhich they thought had entered into the young man. Meantime two breathless infants were taken out into the air and resuscitated. Another old man said that he was ready to give to any worthy woman the mysterious anointing. A large number went up and received this ancient rite. This was administered by cutting a hole in the right arm and introducing medicine under the skin. Women entitled to this privilege were those who had at any period of their lives held a horse or borne arms in battle. At 6 P. M. the sun disappeared under the clouds, and the old man with the buffalo skull on his head uttered a few words and dismissed the audience. Then the dance ended, and an hour later the lodges Avere taken down and most of the Indians started homeward..INDEX. Page.
