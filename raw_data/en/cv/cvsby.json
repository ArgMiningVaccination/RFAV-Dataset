To be completely clear, the College of Chiropractors of Ontario (CCO) states that administering vaccinations is outside the scope of chiropractic practice as defined in [STANDARD OF PRACTICE S-001: Chiropractic Scope of Practice](https://cco.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/S-001April302019.pdf). Specifically, when asked questions by patients that relate to controlled acts (such as vaccinations) outside the chiropractic scope of practice, members shall advise the patient that the performance of the act is outside the chiropractic scope of practice and the patient should consult with a health professional who has the act within his/her scope of practice; In addition, the Ontario Chiropractic Association (OCA) adheres to the Canadian Chiropractic Association's (CCA's) position on vaccination and immunization: Vaccination is a well-established and widely mandated public health policy and the Canadian Chiropractic Association supports public health promotion and prevention strategies that encourage physical and mental health and well-being. The CCA accepts vaccination as a cost-effective and clinically efficient public health preventative procedure for certain viral and microbial diseases, as demonstrated by the scientific community. The public responsibility for vaccination and immunization is neither within the chiropractic scope of practice, nor a chiropractic specific issue. Public health programming and literature provide appropriate sources of information for patient education regarding vaccination and immunization. "}
