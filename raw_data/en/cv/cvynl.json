Healing is a treatment that involves the transfer of energy through the healer to the recipient. It promotes self-healing by relaxing the body, releasing tensions and strengthening the body's own immune system. Healing is natural and non-invasive with the intention of bringing the recipient into a state of balance and wellbeing on all levels' (NFSH Healing Trust) The word 'spiritual' originates from the Latin word 'spiritus' meaning 'breath of life'. The spiritual aspect refers to spiritual energy working at a deep level on our spiritual being. The healing involves the transfer of energy from the healer to the recipient. Specialties in Spiritual Healing My focus in spiritual healing lies on anxiety clients and rituals of all transitions: e.g. birth (welcome ritual), teenage years and death. The search for vocation and one\u00b4s own potential as well as happy partnerships are also part of my field of main applications. Moreover I support people with menopause, career questions and joy of life. In addition I teach Yoga for young and old, with or without restriction.

Foot Reflexology Through the Foot Zone Reflex Massage the self-healing power of the body or the regenerative power present in the human body, is stimulated. The Healing Power of the Heart The heart helps us meet our personal challenges with more grace, wisdom, and love. You cannot hold joy, success, or love in your hand. You cannot buy them. You can only feel them in your heart. They are a state of being. Make the invisible \"visible\". The source of happiness we are all searching for lies within us. There is only one person in charge of your joy, and that is you. Your loved ones, your parents, your children, they do not have the control or the power to create your happiness. They simply can share in your happiness. I would like to guide you on a transformational journey of a lifetime, and help you find your path to a much happier life. Learn to think with your heart and to feel with your mind. An open heart is an open mind.
