Kozlowski Created date: 3/19/21 Updated 8/15 /22 Call Center COVID FAQ | 1 CALL CENTER COVID -19 FAQ Use Ctrl+F to search this file PATIENT VACCINE QUESTIONS: How do vaccines work? A vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. This is what makes vaccines such powerful medicine. Unlike most medicines, which treat or cure diseases, vaccines prevent them. I need support in restraining a special needs patient. Will this be accommodated? One essential chaperone for adult patients who may require physical assistance, support during complex medical decision -making discussions with a physician, or for discharge teaching may accompany the patient. Are these drive -thru vaccinations, or are they done in the building? All vaccinations are done indoors. Can I receive the vaccine in my thigh, or somewhere other than in the arm? Receiving injection in the upper arm (deltoid) is the standard. We can accommodate another location only if there is a clinical reason ( i.e., lymphedema) in both arms. How do I get a vaccine? Who's eligible? We are vaccinating anyone in Illinois and Wisconsin , including children ages 6 months and older . Learn more at aah.org/vaccine . How can I schedule an appointment? There are three options: Our LiveWell app Our website: aah.org/vaccine Our vaccine scheduling hotline: 866-443-2584 Do I have to be an Advocate Aurora Health patient to get vaccinated there? No. We are vaccinating anyone in Illinois and Wisconsin who's 6 months of age and older. Created by: B. Kozlowski Created date: 3/19/21 Updated 8/15 /22 Call Center COVID FAQ | 2 Are the vaccines effective against the COVID -19 variants? The COVID -19 vaccines available in the U.S. are very safe and effective against most variants. While some vaccinated people can get infected, the chances of getting very sick or dying from COVID -19 infection are much less than if you 're not vaccinated. How do I know if my provider is vaccinated against COVID -19? Creating the safest possible environment for you and your family is part of our Safe Care Promise . We implemented a COVID -19 vaccine mandate to keep our team members, patients and communities safe. We are pleased to share all team members are in compliance. Limited exceptions were granted for specific religious or medical reasons, and those team members ar e required to under routine COVID19 testing. In addition, our team members undergo daily symptom screenings before they report to work and are equipped with the appropriate personal protective equipment to ensure everyone's safety and help prevent the spre ad of COVID -19. I'm an Advocate Aurora patient - is it OK if I get the vaccine elsewhere? Yes. Our patients are not required to get the vaccine at an Advocate Aurora facility, and we want everyone to get the vaccine wherever they can as we believe vaccination will bring an end to this pandemic. Which vaccine do patients get? (Can I choose which vaccine I get?) We offer a choice between the two -shot mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) or Novavax for 18 and older . You can choose to schedule eithe r the mRNA or Novavax for dose one. Children from 6 months through 4 years will receive Moderna vaccine . People ages 5 -17 will get the Pfizer vaccine. The FDA has granted full approval of the both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for individuals age 6 months and older allowed under emergency use auth orization. All options are safe and effective . Is the Johnson & Johnson vaccine safe? We've paused our distribution of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine following the CDC's recommendation to administer the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Th is decision follows additional review of research on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine showing about one in every 100,000 women 30 to 49 years of age results in rare but serious blood clots. While these are rare instances, individuals who received the J&J vacc ine and are experiencing symptoms (severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, shortness of breath) within three weeks of receiving it should contact their health care provider. I had COVID -19 and was treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasm a. Can I still get a COVID -19 vaccine? Yes. It's no longer necessary to delay your COVID -19 vaccination following receipt of the monoclonal Created by: B. Kozlowski Created date: 3/19/21 Updated 8/15 /22 Call Center COVID FAQ | 3 antibodies or convalescent plasma per CDC guidance. Talk to your doctor if you're not sure what treatme nts you received or if you need more guidance about getting vaccinated.

We're happy to accommodate your request and will note it in your record. We also recommend you inform clinic staff of your preferences when you check in to receive your vaccine. Should I get the vaccine if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding? The vaccines are very effective in pregnant women. The CDC recommends women who are pregnant or breastfeeding get the COVID -19 vaccine. What's more, pregna nt women are more likely to get severely ill with COVID -19 compared with non -pregnant women, according to the CDC. Is it safe to get a COVID -19 vaccine dose at the same time as other vaccines? According to the CDC, it is safe to receive the COVID -19 vaccin e and other vaccines at the same visit. Experience with other vaccines has shown the way our bodies develop protection, known as immune response, after getting vaccinated and possible side effects of vaccines are generally the same when given alone or with other vaccines. Does my doctor need to know I want to get vaccinated? No, your primary care provider does not need to know or authorize you for the vaccine. However, you can discuss any medical conditions, allergies or other concerns with your doctor if i t will help you make your decision about getting vaccinated. How will Advocate Aurora know if I receive the COVID -19 vaccine from a non -Advocate Aurora community clinic or pharmacy? When you're vaccinated, the vaccination information is registered with the immunization registry appropriate in your state (i.e., the Wisconsin Immunization Registry, also called WIR, or I -CARE, the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange). This allows health care providers, pharmacies and other administering organizations access to a central record of vaccinations. In addition, you should receive a vaccination card or printout that tells you what COVID -19 vaccine you received, the date you received it and where you received it. I lost m y vaccination card. How can I get a new one? If you got your vaccination at an Advocate Aurora location, you can get a copy of your immunization history on LiveWell . You can also request a c opy from your primary care provider or check with the vaccine clinic to see if it can provide you with a replacement card. Other options include state health department's Created by: B. Kozlowski Created date: 3/19/21 Updated 8/15 /22 Call Center COVID FAQ | 4 immunization information system. You can find IIS information on the CDC website or V-safe or VaxText if you enrolled in those tools. If you didn't get your vaccine at an Advocate Aurora location, contact your vaccination provider to access your vaccination record. If you can't contact your vaccination provi der directly, contact your state health department's immunization information system. You can find state IIS information on the CDC website . Vaccination pr oviders are required to report COVID -19 vaccinations to their IIS and related systems. If you enrolled in V-safe or VaxText after your first vaccine dose, you can access your vaccination information using those tools. How much does the vaccine cost? Government funds will be used to give the vaccine at no cost to the public. Administrati ve fees may be subject to insurance but there will be no out -of-pocket costs for our patients. What should I do if I test positive for COVID -19 before my second dose? Advocate Aurora Health recommends you still get the COVID -19 vaccine, but if you're not cleared by your treating provider to enter an Advocate Aurora facility due to symptoms and/or timing of the positive test in time for your appointment, cancel it and contact your primary care provider.

We can assist you in scheduling your second dose or booster at one of our locations , which will require proof of previous vaccinati on.

If it's time for your regular screening mammogram, we recommend getting it. Previously, there was concern the vaccine -induced axillary lymphadenopathy that could result in misdiagnosis of mammograms in patients who were recently vaccinated, and patien ts were advised to delay screening four to six weeks. However, new research by the Radiology Society of North America suggests post -vaccine axillary lymphadenopathy does not have a significant impact on clinical outcomes in screening mammography. The Society of Breast Imaging has updated their guidelines and no longer recommends a delay in screening mammography after COVID -19 vaccination. What happens to unus ed vaccine at the end of the day? We are committed to ensuring no vaccine goes to waste. Should I get vaccinated if I already had COVID -19? It's recommended that people who have previously had COVID -19 receive the vaccine. However, if you are still contagious from the infection then you should delay your vaccine appointment until you are no longer contagious. You should contact your healthcare provider if you are unsure about being contagious. In addition, studies have shown delaying the first or sec ond COVID -19 vaccine booster dose by 3 months from symptom onset or positive test if infection was asymptomatic may result in an improved immune response to vaccination. Can I get a COVID -19 booster? The CDC recommends everyone who is eligible to get a COVID -19 booster shot. Based on guidance from the FDA and CDC, individuals 5 and over who received a Pfizer vaccine are eligible for a booster shot five months or more after their initial vaccination ser ies. Individuals 18 and over who received the Moderna vaccine are eligible for a booster shot five months or more after their initial vaccination series. All people 18 and older who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for their primary dose are eligible for a booster two months after their primary dose. Advocate Aurora is not administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine following CDC's recommendation to administer the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines over the Johnson & Johnson. Individuals who received the Jo hnson & Johnson vaccine can mix -and-match their booster shot. The FDA and CDC have also approved a third dose of the Pfizer vaccines 28 days or more after the second shot for immunocompromised people five and older . Immunocompromised people who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine should get a third dose of the same vaccine. Three months after receiving the Pfizer third dose, moderately and severely immunocompromised people 5 and older may receive a booster shot. Children 6 months to 17 that received the Moderna 3rd dose are not approved to get a booster . Immunocompromised patients who received Johnson and Johnson are now able to receive an additional dose 28 days Created by: B. Kozlowski Created date: 3/19/21 Updated 8/15 /22 Call Center COVID FAQ | 6 after their dose one and a booster dose two months after dose two. They may also get a second booster shot 4 months after first booster shot. People ages 18 -49 may receive a second booster dose using an mRNA vaccine 4 mont hs if both their primary dose and first booster dose were Johnson and Johnson . People should talk to their health care provider about their medical condition, and whether getting an additional dose is appropriate for them . Should I get a second booster? The FDA approved a second booster dose of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID -19 vaccines for older people and certain immunocompromised individ uals. Emerging evidence suggests a second booster dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine improves protection against severe COVID -19. A second booster of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines may be administered to individuals 50 years and older at least four months a fter the first booster dose of any COVID -19 vaccine. A second booster of the Pfizer vaccine may be administered to certain immunocompromised individuals 12 years and older at least four months after the first booster dose of any COVID -19 vaccine. These inc lude people who've had a solid organ transplant or similarly immunocompromised individuals. A second booster of the Moderna vaccine may be administered to similarly immunocompromised individuals 18 years and older at least four months after the first boost er dose of any COVID -19 vaccine. In addition, people ages 18 -49 years who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised and received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as both their primary series dose and booster dose may receive a second booster dose using an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine at least 4 months after the first J&J booster dose. Which vaccines are available as booster shots? Advocate Aurora is not administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine following CDC's recommendation to administer the Pfizer an d Moderna vaccines over the Johnson & Johnson. Individuals who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can mix -and-match their booster shot. Can I get a different vaccine for my booster shot from what I got previously? Yes. The CDC's recommendations allow for mix -and-match dosing for booster shots. I qualify for a booster shot. How can I get one? Patients, individuals, and team members can schedule their third or booster shot via the LiveWell app, aah.org or by calling our vaccine hotline at 866 -443-2584. Y ou also can contact your provider to schedule a booster shot. Should I get a COVID -19 antibody test to confirm the need for a vaccine booster or to confirm vaccine efficacy?

The CDC advises getting tested for COVID -19 three to five days after being in close contact with someone who has COVID -19, even if you don't have symptoms. Wear a mask indoors in public for 10 days after exposure or until you test negative. Quarantine for at least 5 days if you test positive. I've heard that you won't prescribe ivermectin to treat COVID -19. Why not? In keeping with evidence -based prescribing practices and guidance from the FDA and CDC, we do not support or recommend the administration of ivermectin for treatment of COVID -19.

Is the vaccine safe for 12 and above ? I've read reports about myocarditis in teens. The CDC has concluded that while there is a \"likely association\" between Pfizer - BioNTech and Moderna's mRNA COVID -19 vaccines and myocarditis, an inflammatory heart condition, in individuals 30 Created by: B. Kozlowski Created date: 3/19/21 Updated 8/15 /22 Call Center COVID FAQ | 9 and younger, these cases are extremely rare and the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risk of this side effect.

Your health and safety is our highest priority, and our additional measures in place are to protect you and our healthcare workers. CALL CENTER COVID FAQ | 5 Why is everyone required to wear a mask? We know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with COVID -19 lack symptoms - and that even those who eventually develop symptoms can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread b etween people interacting in close proximity \u2014for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing \u2014even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. Thus, the CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. I don't want to wear a mask.

Universal masking requires everyone entering our facilities to wear an approved mask (procedure mask or cloth mask) while in our facility unless unable to safely do so.
