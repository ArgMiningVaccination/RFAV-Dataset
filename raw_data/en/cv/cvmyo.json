RATIONALE When young children are in ECE programs, they are exposed to many germs (e.g., viruses, bacteria). Th us, to prevent and manage illness e ectively, ECE programs need clear health policies, up-to-date information and sensitive communication between ECE sta , families and children. When necessary, ECE sta may communi- cate with local health departments and primary care providers about speci c diseases or health problems after they get written permission from a parent or guardian.2nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesWHAT A CCHA NEEDS TO KNOW Young children have frequent illnesses that are often caused by contagious viruses and bacteria. Illnesses are inevitable among young children, and children in ECE programs are more likely to get sick than chil-dren who stay at home (Holmes, Morrow & Pickering, 1996; Pickering & Morrow, 1996). Infants and young children in ECE programs have a higher rate of cer-tain infectious diseases and a higher risk of getting organisms that are resistant to antibiotics (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network [NICHD], 2001, 2003). Children between the ages of 6 weeks and 17 months have a higher risk of respiratory (related to the lungs) illness if they are enrolled in an ECE pro-gram at least 10 hours per week (Hurwitz, Gunn, Pinsky & Schonberger, 1991). Children under 3 years of age attending ECE programs are 3.5 times more likely to have an acute gastrointestinal (related to the stomach and intestines) illness than children who stay at home. Children between the ages of 3 to 5 who are enrolled in ECE programs are twice as likely to have an acute gastrointestinal illness (Kotch & Bryant, 1990). Since young children have immune systems that are not fully developed, they are more vulnerable when they become ill. An educational program for ECE sta to learn about how infections are transmitted and the importance of hand washing for both sta and children lowered the number of gastrointestinal illnesses for chil- dren over 2 years of age by 50% (Roberts, Jorm, Patel, Smith, Douglas & McGilchrist, 2000). Another edu-cational program for ECE sta about how infections are transm itted, hand washing and an aseptic nose- wiping technique lowered the number of colds (respiratory illnesses) for children under 2 years of age by 17% (Roberts, Smith, Jorm, Patel, Douglas & McGilchrist, 2000). Th e terms infectious disease and communicable disease are somewhat similar in meaning, but there is a dif-ference. Infectious diseases are caused by germs, such as bacteria or viruses, no matter how the germs are picked up. Communicable diseases are a type of infec-tious disease. Communicable diseases are caused when germs are spread among people, either through contact from person to person (such as the common cold or a viral illness) or through contact with a nonhuman h ost (such as West Nile virus, carried by mosquitoes that infect humans). See Handout: Health and Safety Notes: Exposure to Communicable Disease. To help prevent and manage illness in ECE programs, it is important for the Child Care Health Advocate (CCHA) to understand the following: Why are children at risk? What types of diseases occur most often in ECE programs? How are diseases spread? What are the ECE provider's responsibilities for preventing and treating illness? Why Are Children at Risk? Children are at risk for getting communicable dis-eases in ECE programs for many reasons. Children have developing immune systems that are not as e cient at ghting o viruses as an adult's immune system. When people are exposed to an illness, the body responds by making antibodies (substances that help defend the body from the illness). Th e next time the immune system comes across that illness, the person either does not get the illness or gets a less severe case of it. Young children are more vulnerable to getting sick after they are exposed to a new germ in the environment. Th is \"new\" group of germs is often referred to as a germ pool . Th e germ pool in a private home might be very di erent from that found in an ECE program. Infants and young children explore their envi- ronment by using their hands and mouths. Children touch their noses, then touch toys, then touch other children and then put toys in their mouths to suck on. Th rough these hand-to- mouth activities, children are exposed to germs. Surfaces and objects, including toys, bottles, paci ers, sandboxes, water tables and doorknobs, are often touched by children carrying germs. Because young children do not wash their hands on their own after toileting, eating or wiping their noses, they often spread germs. Young children are close to the ground and spend a lot of time on the fl oor.Preventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n3 Sta members can also spread germs. ECE providers are very busy and may not always take time to wash their hands between activities (such as diapering, wiping noses and preparing food). In addition, if ECE providers come to work while sick, they may spread illness to children in their care. What Types of Diseases Occur Most Often in ECE Programs? Many infectious diseases are co mmonly seen in infants and young children in ECE programs (see Tables 1 and 2). Ear infections (otitis media), upper respira-tory infections and gastrointestinal illnesses are more common in children enrolled in ECE programs than children raised at home (NICHD, 2001, 2003). Table 2 shows which diseases happen more often in ECE programs. A list of communicable diseases that should be reported in California can also be found in the Hand- out: Health and Safety Notes: Exposure to Communicable Disease . Runny noses are often the sign of a respira- tory illness caused by a virus, but can also come from crying, teething, being out in cold weather, or allergies (see Handout: Health and Safety Notes: Runny Nose in the Child Care Setting ). Sometimes, a child will have been on nose drops for too long and will have what is called a \"rebound\" runny nose. Nose drops should never be used for longer than 5 days, especially if they contain a decongestant. Infants often have rashes that are not contagious. Noncontagious rashes are sometimes seen in young children as well. Infants have two common rashes: heat rash and milia. Milia occurs on the face and con-sists of very small, white bumps over the forehead and cheeks. It is harmless and eventually goes away. Heat rash can be found mostly in the skin folds of a child and is a small, red rash that is most often the result of being too bundled up. It will disappear once the child is cooler. If it does not go away when the child is in a cooler place, the parents should be noti ed and asked to talk to a health care provider. Nausea and vomiting are also commonly seen in ECE programs. Th ere are many reasons for nausea and vom- iting, including illness, so a vomiting infant should be separated from other children and monitored closely for signs of dehydration and illness. How Are Diseases Spread in ECE Programs? Understanding how infectious disease is spread is essen- tial to preventing illness in ECE programs. Viruses, bacteria and germs can be spread from person to per- son in many di erent ways, including the following: respiratory, fecal-oral, skin-to-skin and through body fl uids (such as blood, saliva and urine) (see Table 1). Respiratory Th e most common way diseases pass from one child to another is through direct contact with the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth or eyes. Children spread disease this way most often because of their inadequate hygiene (for example, infrequent or inade-quate hand washing, or rubbing of eyes). For instance, if a child sneezes on a toy, and then another child puts that toy in his or her mouth, the germs have been passed on. Th is is known as respiratory transmission. Illnesses caused by this method of transmission include the following: recurrent middle ear infection (otitis media) meningitis upper respiratory infections (colds, coughs, sinusitis) sore throat lower respiratory infections (pneumonia, respira- tory syncytial virus [RSV]) Haemophilus infl uenzae type B (Hib) whooping cough (pertussis) tuberculosis Fecal-Oral Viruses can be passed from one person to another through fecal-oral transmission. Th is means that through inadequate hand washing or hand-to-mouth behavior, fecal material is brought into a child's mouth, causing illness. Children in diapers and children that put toys and other objects in their mouths are at risk for fecal-oral transmission of disease. In addition, an uncovered sandbox can contain cat or other animal feces that may cause disease in humans. Illnesses caused by this method of transmission include diarrheal illnesses, pinworms, hand-foot-mouth dis-ease (coxsackie), and hepatitis A.4nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesSkin-to-Skin A number of viruses can be spread by skin-to-skin contact. Touching and sharing of personal belongings, dress-up clothes, stu ed toys and other items can con- tribute to the transmission of some infections. Illnesses caused by this method of transmissio n include the following: chickenpox (varicella) impetigo (skin infection caused by bacteria) scabies (itchy skin caused by mites) head Pathogens) Germs live in body fl uids such as blood, urine and saliva. When children put toys and ngers in their mouths, they can spread disease through their body fl uids. Bac- teria and viruses carried in the blood create a small but serious risk in ECE programs. However, the spread of illness through blood contact is rare in children. Illnesses caused by this method of transmissio n include the following: cytomegalovirus (CMV) (viral infection that is usu- ally harmless unless the immune system is weak) hepatitis B hepatitis C HIV/AIDSTABLE 1 INFECTIOUS DISEASES DOCUMENTED IN ECE PROGRAMS Route of TransmissionBacteria Virus Illness in ECE Programs nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n5TABLE 2 INFECTIOUS DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH ECE PROGRAMS Type of Disease or InfectionExamples Higher Incidence Enteric infection Diarrhea Hepatitis Ayes yes Respiratory tract infection Otitis media Sinusitis Pharyngitis Pneumoniayes probably probably diseases Hepatitis Human immunode (HIV)not established yes Skin disease Impetigo ScabiesPediculosisRingwormprobably probably probably probably Adapted from Pickering and Osterholm, 19976nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesSta in ECE programs should receive training on preventing the spread of diseases through blood, often called the bloodborne pathogen training or the Occu-pational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Exposure Control Plan. Since ECE providers may handle blood if there is an injury or if blood is pres-ent in other body fl uids such as vomit, they should be aware of standard precautions. Standard precautions. Th e term universal pre- cautions is used for the guidelines that were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the 1980s to reduce the spread of infection through blood to health care providers and patients in health care settings. Standard precautions is the new term used for an expansion of universal precautions, recognizing that any body fl uid may hold contagious germs. Th ey are still mainly designed to prevent the spread of bloodborne disease (disease carried by blood or other body fl uids), but are also excellent measures to prevent the spread of infectious disease in ECE pro-grams (see Handout: Health and Safety Notes: Standard and Universal Precautions in the Child Care Setting ). ECE programs follow the same standard precautions as clinics and hospital settings with the following exceptions: Use of nonporous gloves is optional, except when blood or blood-containing body fl uids may be involved. Gowns and masks are not required. Appropriate barriers include materials such as disposable diaper table paper, disposable towels and surfaces that can be cleaned in ECE pro- grams. Training on job-related risks related to han- dling body fl uids. Th e director of an ECE program should make sure that all sta at risk of coming into contact with blood as part of their job has training in the following areas at the time of orientation and annually (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], American Public Health Association & National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care, 2002): ways that bloodborne diseases can spread standard precautions program policies and procedures regarding expo- sure to blood and other body fl uids reporting procedures under the exposure con- trol plan to make sure that all rst aid incidents involving blood exposure are reported to the employer before the end of the work shift during which the incident occurs What Are the ECE Provider's Responsibilities Related to Prevention and Treatment of Illness? Hand Washing Regular hand washing is the most important method of infection control for preventing illness in children and ECE providers (Kotch, Weigle & Weber, 1994; Roberts, Smith, Jorm et al., 2000). Many studies have shown that unwashed or improperly washed hands are the main ways to spread infection. When provid-ers, children and parents wash their hands at proper times and with the proper technique, the spread of illness can be drastically reduced. Immunization ECE providers often need help putting an immu- nization tracking program into place. Children must have current immunizations when they enter and during the time they are enrolled in an ECE program (State of California, 2002) (see Handout: California Immunization Requirements for Child Care and Hand- out: School and Child Care Immunization Requirements for Schools and Child Care Programs, California Immu-nization Handbook, 7th Edition, July 2003 ). These California child care requirements are di erent than the immunization schedule recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC and the AAP (see Handout: Recommended Childhood and Adolescent Immunization Schedule - United States, 2005 ). CCHAs can explain the di erences to ECE providers and emphasize that ECE programs need to follow the state child care requirements. Reducing serious vaccine-preventable diseases in ECE programs is an important part of infection control. Mak-ing sure that children stay up-to-date on immunizations is an ongoing process and requires careful monitoring. Helping programs follow immunization recommen-dations also has a secondary gain in that it will connect families to a source of health care and health insur-ance. CCHAs can provide immunization training Preventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n7and assessment, record review, immunization tracking systems, parent education and resources, and community resources. If there are children who have not received their immunizations, ECE providers need to be aware of the issues involved (see Handout: Health and Safety Notes: Unimmunized Children in the Child Care Setting ). WHAT A CCHA NEEDS TO DO Prevent Illness Prevention is the main way to reduce the frequency of communicable diseases in ECE programs. Preven-tion takes place through a variety of methods, such as immunization, hand washing, policy development and disease management. Th e most important step a CCHA can take is to assure proper and frequent hand washing in the ECE program. It is especially important for the sta to model good hand washing, as the children will follow their examples. Understanding the importance and impact of immu- nizations, educating sta and maintaining current immunization records on both children and sta is another e ective way to prevent the occurrence of vaccine-preventable illnesses. See the following hand-outs: California Immunization Requirements for Child Care; Recommended Childhood and Adolescent Immuni-zation Schedule - United States ; and Health and Safety Notes: Unimmunized Children in the Child Care Setting . Develop Policies Th e CCHA needs to help develop and/or implement policies and practices that prevent the spread of ill-ness. Each program needs to decide what policies are appropriate for its families. Th e following is a list of recommended policies that should be in place in an ECE program (AAP et al., 2002): hand washing diapering/toileting cleaning toys handling of body fl uids, soiled clothing and bedding preparing, handling, labeling and storing breast milk and formula bottles preparing food understanding and putting into practice standard precautions understanding the immunization schedule and making sure that children and sta are up-to- date with their immunizations exclusion/inclusion knowing and understanding the reportable dis- eases in your area or state putting into practice competent and current sanitation practices communicating with parents about exclusion policies communicating with parents when children have been ill during care Provide Guidance on Exclusion and Inclusion Policies CCHAs can introduce ECE programs and families to up-to-date guidelines for exclusion from and inclu-sion into ECE programs. At rst glance, one might think that exclusion and inclusion policies do not go together. Many ECE programs have exclusion poli-cies, but do not address when children who have been excluded can come back to care (see Handout: Health and Safety Notes: Excluding Children Due to Illness ). Recent guidelines tend to focus on a child's behavior, rather than on speci c symptoms, which puts the focus on whether children are too sick to participate rather than on whether they have a frequent cough. Th ere are times when a mildly ill child can be included, and these criteria need to be communicated clearly both verbally and in writing to families. Exclusion guide-lines are clearly described in the National standards (AAP et al., 2002, Standard 3.065). It is important for an ECE program to have policies for sta sick days and sta exclusion and inclusion as well. In general, a child with a runny nose does not need to be excluded, except in the following circumstances: Th e child is so uncomfortable that he or she can- not participate in activities. Th ere is a smelly discharge on one side of the nostril, and it is a color other than white or yellow, 8nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health Advocateswhich may indicate that there is a foreign object in the nose such as a bean, pea or other small object. Th e nasal drainage is accompanied by a fever or other symptoms of a more serious condition (see Handout: Fact Sheets for Families: Fever ). CCHAs should be aware of and have a list of those diseases that are reportable to the health department and also have a list of criteria for when a child may return to care if he or she has certain diseases. Th is can be obtained through your Child Care Health Consul-tant (CCHC) or local health department. Th e following sources may create challenges to put- ting exclusion and inclusion policies into practice: families, ECE providers, health care providers and CCHAs. Families Sometimes exclusion policies can cause conflict between families and ECE providers. Families whose children are ill have a dilemma. Th ey are concerned about their child, yet also have to consider other family and work-related responsibilities. Parents of children attending ECE programs report that they miss from 1 to 4 weeks of work per year to care for their ill children (Davis, MacKenzis & Addis, 1994). It is important for ECE providers to be very clear that if children are ill, they must be excluded from care for the period of the illness. Parents may need assistance with developing backup plans if they are unable to pick up the child during the work day, or if they are unable to be absent from work to care for ill children. ECE providers ECE providers also face dilemmas. Th ey must be alert to preventing the spread of communicable disease and be responsible for providing the best care possible to both sick and well children. Each ECE program has factors that may infl uence their exclusion and inclusion policies. Some of these may include the following: desire to reduce the spread of disease extra attention that a mildly ill child may require, and the capacity of the center or site to provide extra time quali cations of the sta to care for mildly ill children space to safely separate mildly ill children from the other children and time to supervise all chil-dren adequately needs of the other children needs of the parents amount of time involved in cleaning and strict hygiene practices Health care providers Health care providers face concerns when a child enrolled in an ECE program is ill. Th eir rst consid- eration is for the child, but they may also feel pressure to permit the child to return to care as early as pos-sible to allow the family to go back to work or to their usual routine. It is important to communicate clearly with families and health care providers when there is a health concern. Using standardized forms such as the Handout: Information Exchange on Children with Health Concerns Form is a good way to make sure that the proper information is communicated. ECE pro-viders can document their concerns and observations on this form, and health care providers can commu-nicate their diagnosis and recommended treatment to the ECE provider. Parents need to give their consent for this information to be released to the ECE provider. CCHAs Th e CCHA's role is to identify the needs of the ECE program and the needs of the children and families and adopt or revise a policy that best meets the needs of those a ected by the policy. Th e CCHA encourages good choices that promote children's normal growth and development, as well as good disease prevention practices, by helping to develop and implement strong policies. Conduct Daily Morning Health Checks Daily morning health checks help ECE providers judge what is normal for each child and identify prob-lems early. Discovering recent illness in children and their families reduces the spread of communicable diseases. CCHAs can help ECE providers establish a Daily Morning Health Check procedure and train sta in conducting checks (see Handout: Morning Health Check ).Preventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n9Th e National standards (AAP et al., 2002, Standard 3.001) state the following: everyday, a trained sta member shall conduct a health check of each child. Th is health check shall be conducted as soon as pos- sible after the child enters the child care facility and whenever a change occurs while that child is in care. Th e health check shall address the following: changes in behavior (such as lethargy or drowsi- ness) or appearance from the behaviors and appearance observed during the previous day's attendance skin rashes, itchy skin, itchy scalp or (during a lice outbreak) nits high body temperature (determined by taking the child's temperature) complaints of pain or of not feeling well other signs or symptoms of illness (such as drainage from eyes, vomiting, diarrhea and so on) reported illness or injury in child or family members since last date of attendance Practice Sanitation and Safety To keep germs from spreading, surfaces and toys should be cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis (see Handout: Health and Safety Notes: Recommendations for Cleaning, Sanitizing and Disinfecting ). Sanitation practices by the sta and children should be based on current research on the best and proper way to clean a variety of surfaces and objects. Use the information from labels, health departments and the CCHC to assist in developing good cleaning and janitorial prac-tices. Toys that cannot be properly and safely sanitized should be eliminated if possible from the ECE pro-gram (AAP et al., 2002, Standard 3.036). Toys that children have placed in their mouths or that are oth-erwise contaminated by body secretion or excretion shall be set aside where children cannot reach them (AAP et al., 2002, Standard 3.036). Environmental issues, such as open sandboxes and other outdoor and indoor safety and sanitation con-cerns, need to be followed up. Checking the outdoor play areas for used needles, used condoms, other evidence of body fl uids, standing water and unusual debris or water on the grounds on a daily basis early in the morning is an essential part of protecting the children and sta from contact with unsafe materials. One sta person should be assigned this duty at each ECE program. Provide Links to Community Resources The CCHA should be aware of local, convenient facilities that are licensed to care for mildly ill chil-dren and be prepared to provide this information to parents as needed. CCHAs can also make sure that ECE programs are connected to the local commu-nicable disease branch of their health department. CCHAs should encourage key relationships with health department sta and the immunization coor- dinator. Provide Educational Materials Posters for hand washing and diapering procedures should be put up in many easy-to-see places in the ECE program. Handouts for parents are helpful in promoting illness prevention. Th ere are many chil- dren's books about being sick and going to the doctor, dentist and other health care providers. Th ese are a positive addition to reading centers in the ECE pro-gram. Regular communication with families and sta about prevention techniques, hand washing, coughing in your elbow and not in your hand, immunizations, or well family classes or books is positive and helps to model the message that preventive health is important. It is also important to have a system of communication with families when any unusual symptom is noticed in a child in care. For instance, a rash, a runny nose, upset stomach and other symptoms should be com- municated to the family even if the symptom has gone away by the time the child is picked up for the day. Th ere are also books written by professionals who have experience with ECE programs that o er resources for developing policies and practices that help pro-grams decrease the spread of communicable disease. Train ECE Staff in Medication Administration Because young children in ECE programs have fre- quent, common illnesses, or noncontagious illnesses, and because some children have chronic health con-10nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health Advocatesditions, ECE providers will need to give medication in some circumstances (see Handout: Health and Safety Notes: Medication Administration in Child Care Programs ). CCHAs can help programs develop clear policies and practices regarding medication admin-istration, as well as train sta in proper medication administration. Precautions should always include checking that the name of the child on the medica-tion and the child receiving the medication are the same; reading and understanding the label/prescrip-tion; administering medication according to the prescribed method and dose; observing and reporting any side e ects from medications; and document- ing the administration of each dose by the time and amount given (AAP et al., 2002, Standard 3.083). Cultural Implications Cultural traditions or personal beliefs may confl ict with recommendations for the prevention of the spread of disease. For example, some cultures may discourage or forbid the use of immunizations for disease preven-tion, or it may be the custom to eat with hands until a certain age. Some cultures use folk medicine and elders who have experience with \"healing\" and may prefer to use the advice and treatments they recom-mend instead of interventions that are more familiar to ECE sta . Implications for Children and Families CCHAs can help children learn good hygiene prac- tices that are appropriate to their age. Parents will potentially miss less work if good preventive measures are in place in the ECE program and the policies for ill children are brief and easy to understand. Implications for ECE Providers If prevention e orts are successful, children will have fewer illnesses requiring absence from ECE, and ECE sta will be healthier as well. Th e ECE program will be cleaner and the sta will understand the reasons for sanitizing and cleaning toys and other materials. Sta will know the signs and symptoms of communicable diseases and how the diseases are transmitted, and will be able to step in more quickly, thereby decreasing the opportunity for a disease to spread rapidly.Preventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n11ACTIVITY 1: I'VE GOT A SECRET Th e trainer will pass around a sheet marked \"I've got a secret\" and ask participants to write about a medication error they have made while working in an ECE program. Th is information will be con dential and anonymous. Complete the sheet anonymously and give it to the trainer. Discuss the kinds of medications you expect to see in ECE programs. Discuss common ways medications are given in ECE programs. What are common errors made? How can these errors be avoided in the future? ACTIVITY 2: IMMUNIZATION ASSESSMENT ACTIVITY Using the California Immunization Handbook as a guide, perform an immunization assessment on a sample immunization card handed out by the trainer. Transfer all of the information from the child's record to the blue card. Determine which immunizations are due by using two methods: the immunization schedule and the \"pink windows.\" Complete a Notice of Immunizations Needed form to give to the parent. Find out when immunizations will be due again.

Fever is a rise in body temperature above normal. Although the range of normal temperature varies de-pending on the method used, it is generally accepted that a temperature of more than 100\u00ba F (38\u00ba C) measured by any method is a fever. Fever is not an illness. In fact, a fever is one way the body\u00c0 ghts infections caused by either viruses or bac- teria. It usually will not hurt your child. How do you measure a fever? By feeling your child's forehead, face or chest you may know if he or she has a fever, but taking his or her tem-perature is the only way to know for sure . Although temperature measurement in children seems simple, the choice of method is complicated. It depends on your child's age, simplicity of use, cost, accuracy and choice of technology. Ways to measure a fever By mouth (oral method)\u2014recommended for children older than 4 years. In the armpit (axillary method)\u2014recommended for in- fants and toddlers, but also reliable for older children. Rectally \u2014not recommended for safety reasons. In the ear (tympanic method)\u2014requires special ther- mometers and training. When should you get medical help? Despite our concerns, fever is a common symptom for young children that is rarely harmful and usually does not require treatment. Mild or short-term higher tem-perature is common with minor infections and many other things including exercise, time of the day and en-vironment (such as a hot room or hot day). High fevers (temperatures of 103\u00b0 F and up) or those rising rapidly can signal a potentially dangerous infection. In seeking medical help, the child's age and appear- ance are two major factors. While fever in newborns is rare and often indicates a serious problem, for older infants and children it depends on how the child looks and behaves. Call the health care provider immediately if: The infant is 4 months of age or younger and has fever. A child between 4 months and one year of age has a fever lasting more than 24 hours. The child's fever is 104\u00ba F or more. The child looks very sick, is not eating or play- ing, is unresponsive, or is having dif \u00c0 culty breathing unrelated to a stuffy nose. The child has other signs of illness such as stiff neck, rash or a sore throat that has lasted for 2 to 3 days. The fever remains above 103\u00ba F after an hour or two of home treatment. The fever lasts more than two days. How do you manage a fever at home? Without medicine: Fever doesn't always need to be treated. If active, playful and showing no other symptoms, the child may not need medication. Dress in light clothing to allow heat loss through skin, but use a light blanket if the child feels cold. Give extra \u00c1 uids to prevent dehydration or extra loss of water. With medicine: Medication is only needed to make a child more comfortable or when the child has seizures with fever. If you wish to treat a fever, acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be used to lower a fever. The child's health care provider can suggest the recommended pediatric dose. If the health care provider recommends ibuprofen (Motrin/Advil), it can be used every 6 to 8 hours. Always avoid aspirin because of its association with the sometimes deadly Reye's syndrome. Temperature tips Take young children's temperature in the armpit. Don't use temperature strips or paci \u00c0 ers; they are not accurate. Do not use glass thermometers with mercury; they are dangerous. Wash the thermometer after use with warm (not hot) soapy water or swab with rubbing alcohol. by A.

Start the day with a health check. Perform a brief and casual assessment of each child every day upon arrival and before the parent leaves. You are familiar with whatis typical for each child and can identify \"red flags.\" Listen to what the child and parent tell you about how the child is feeling. Is the child hoarse, having trouble breathing, or coughing? Did he or she eat breakfast? Look at children from their level. Observe for signs of crankiness, pain, discomfort or fatigue. Does the childlook pale, have a rash, sores or runny nose or eyes? Feelthe child's cheek and neck with the back of your hand for warmth, clamminess or bumps. Smell for unusual odors in their breath or diaper. 2. Distribute and explain your exclusion policies to par- ents and staff. Have a clear, up-to-date exclusion policy for illness and provide parents with a copy. Ask yourhealth consultant or a health professional to review it pe- riodically. Writing a sound policy and enforcing it consistently will help reduce conflicts. Make sure all staff understand the policies and how to enforce them. 3. Understand the reasons for exclusion. The child doesn't feel well enough to participate com- fortably in routine activities. The ill child requires more care than staff are able to provide without compromising the health and safety of the other children. The illness is any of the specific list of diagnosed symptoms or conditions for which exclusion is rec-ommended. 4. Notify parents. Inform parents of observed signs or symptoms, and promptly notify all families when a di- agnosed communicable condition arises. Post a notice that includes the signs and symptoms to watch for,what to do, and when children with the condition can return.Conditions for which exclusion is not recommended: Certain conditions, by themselves, do not require exclu-sion unless recommended by the child's health care provider or the public health department. However, thereasons listed in step 3 still apply. 1. Fever in the absence of any other signs or symptoms of illness. 2. Presence of germs in urine or stool in the absence of symptoms of illness. Exceptions include potentiallyserious organisms such as E. coli 0157:H7, shigella or salmonella. 3. Nonpurulent conjunctivitis, defined as a pink eye with a clear, watery discharge and without fever, eyepain, or eyelid redness. 4. Rash without fever and without behavior changes.5. Diagnosed CMV infection.6. Carrier of hepatitis B virus, if they have no behavioral or medical risk factors such as unusually aggressive behavior (biting), oozing rashes or bleeding. 7. HIV infection, provided the child's health, immune status and behavior are appropriate as determined by that child's medical provider. Symptoms or conditions for which exclusion is recommended: For some conditions, exclusion can significantly reducethe spread of infection or allow children time to recover tothe point where you can safely care for them: 1. Fever along with behavior change or other signs of illness such as sore throat, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, earache, etc. Fever is defined as having a tempera-ture of 100\u00ba F or higher taken under the arm. Oral temperatures should not be taken on children younger than four years of age. Rectal temperatures are no longer recommended in the child care setting, and mercury-containing thermometers should be avoided. A temperature over 99\u00ba F (under the arm) in an infant under 4 months of age should be evaluated by a medical professional.24nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health Advocates2.Symptoms and signs of possible severe illness such as unusual tiredness, uncontrolled coughing or wheezing, continuous crying, or difficulty breathing. 3.Diarrhea - runny, watery or bloody stools. 4.Vomiting - more than once in a 24-hour period. 5.Body rash with fever. 6.Sore throat with fever and swollen glands or mouth sores with drooling. 7.Eye discharge - thick mucus or pus draining from the eye. (Viral conjunctivitis usually has a clear, watery discharge and may not require medication or exclu- sion.) 8.Head lice or nits (eggs) 9.Severe coughing - child gets red or blue in the face, or makes high-pitched whooping sound after coughing. 10.Child is irritable, continuously crying , or requires more attention and care than you can provide with- out compromising the health and safety of the other children in your care. What to do when a child becomes ill in your program Attempt to keep the child from intimate contact with other children and staff. Remove and sanitize toys andother items they may have put into their mouth. WASH HANDS! Contact the parents to have the child picked up as soon as possible. Make the child as comfortable as pos- sible. Do not isolate them in such a way that youcannot provide supervision at all times. Continue to observe the child for new or worsening symptoms. If the child does not respond to you, is having trouble breathing, or is having a seizure, call 9-1-1. Document your actions in the child's file with date, time, symptoms, actions taken, by whom, and be sure to add your signature. When to get immediate help Some conditions require immediate medical help. If theparent can be reached, tell them to come right away and to notify their medical provider. If the parent or the child's medical provider is not immediately available, call 9-1-1 (EMS) for immediate help.Tell the parent to come right away, and get medical help immediately, when any of the following things happen: An infant under four months of age has an axillary (\"armpit\") temperature of 100\u00ba F or higher. A child over four months of age has an axillary tem- perature of 105\u00ba F or higher. An infant under four months of age has two or more forceful vomiting episodes (not the simple return of swallowed milk or spit-up) after eating. A child looks or acts very ill, or seems to be getting worse quickly. A child has neck pain when the head is moved or touched. A child has a stiff neck or severe headache. A child has a seizure for the first time. A child acts unusually confused. A child has uneven, different-sized pupils (black cen- ter spots of the eyes). A child has a blood-red or purple rash made up of pinhead-sized spots or bruises that are not associatedwith injury. A child has a rash of hives or welts that appears quickly. A child breathes so fast or hard that he or she cannot play, talk, cry or drink. A child has a severe stomach ache that causes the child to double up and scream. A child has a stomach ache without vomiting or diar- rhea after a recent injury, blow to the abdomen or hard fall. A child has stools that are black or have blood mixed through them. A child has not urinated in more than eight hours, and the mouth and tongue look dry. A child has continous, clear drainage from the nose after a hard blow to the head.

You and the parents will benet from the communication of your health and safety policies, health and safety messages and new knowledge gained on health and safety issues. You are also required to inform parents when children in your care are exposed to a communicable disease. This health and safety note will help you prepare a writ- ten notice to parents about exposure of their children to a communicable disease. The notice will alert them to watch for signs of that illness and seek medical advice when necessary. Condentiality Please keep in mind that when notifying parents about exposure, the condentiality of the ill person should be maintained. You should not report the name of the child, other family member, or staff member who is ill to other parents. Let the parents of an ill child know ahead of time that you will be sending exposure notices to other parents but will not mention any names. Reporting Communicable Diseases to Outside Agencies All licensed child care programs are required to report outbreaks of some communicable diseases to both Community Care Licensing and the local public health department. A list of those diseases which are reportable in California is included on the nal page of this note. An outbreak is dened as two or more known or suspected cases of a disease. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends that child care provid-ers report even if there is only a single case, to ensure that the local Public Health Department is aware that this serious illness is present in a child care setting. When you report to licensing and your local health de- partment, the parents of the children must be informedthat you are required to report the disease. The children's health care providers are also required to report commu-nicable disease to the health department. We encourageyou to work closely with the local health department toreassure and inform parents and staff. The requirement to report communicable diseases to the local health department applies to any licensed facility,whether it is a center or family child care home. How-ever, we strongly encourage unlicensed providers toreport communicable diseases as well and work closelywith their local health department. Parental Responsibilities Just as child care providers have an obligation to repor t when children in care are exposed to a communicable dis-ease, parents have the same obligation to report diseasesto the child care program within 24 hours of a diagnosis,even if they keep their child at home. That way, the child care provider can alert other parents to watch for signsof that illness in their children and seek medical advicewhen necessary. Exclusion Policies Distribute and explain your exclusion policies to parents and staff before illness arises. Have a clear, up-to-dateexclusion policy for illness and provide parents with acopy when they enroll their child in your program. As k your health consultant or a health professional to review it periodically. Writing a sound policy and enforcing i t consistently will help reduce conflicts.

If a child has a mild illness or a non-contagious illness that requires medication there is no reason to exclude that child from your program. However, it is important to develop plans to assure that medications are given safely and stored correctly, and to seek advice when needed. All staff who work with children should have training on these practices (American Acad- emy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association, 2002).Check that the name of the child listed on the medication and the child receiving the medica-tion are the same. Read and understand the label/prescription in- structions related to measured dose, frequency, and other circumstances related to administra-tion (such as in relation to meals). Administer the medication according to the pre- scribed methods and prescribed dose. Observe and report any side effects from medi- cations. Document the administration of each dose by recording time and amount given. Medication should be given at home whenever pos- sible, but there will be times when it must be given while the child is in child care. States have different regulations; be sure you understand the regulations for your state. California Community Care Licens-ing (CCL) regulations permit child care providers to administer medications under the following condi-tions: All prescription and nonprescription medica- tions must bear the child's name and date. All medications must be administered according to the label direction. Permission and instruc-tions must be provided by the parent for each medication. The instructions should not con \u00c1 ict with the label directions and should be \u00c0 led in the child's record. Nonprescription medications do not require ap- proval of the child's health care provider if ad-ministered according to the product label and if parental approval and instructions are provided in writing from the parent. The instructions from the parent cannot con \u00c1 ict with the product label and must be \u00c0 led with the child's records. (Please note that Caring for Our Children recom- mends that obtaining a written approval or in-struction from the child's health care provider is a safe practice.) The child care provider has a plan to record ad- ministration of medication and to inform the parent of daily medication administration. When no longer needed all medications are re- turned to the parent. Most Frequently Given Medications in Child Care Programs Antibiotics (given by mouth) - used to treat bacte- rial infections of the ear, respiratory tract, urinary tract or skin. Acetaminophen (e.g. Children's Tylenol or Panadol) - used to treat fever and pain. Antihistamines (e.g. Benadryl) - used to treat aller- gic reactions such as runny nose or hives. Bronchodilators - used to prevent or treat asthma attacks. Special equipment such as inhalers or nebu-lizers is also needed to give bronchodilators. When a nebulizer is needed, a special form from CCL must be completed by the parent and child care provider.30nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesDecongestants (e.g. Dimetapp) - used to reduce stuf\u00c0 ness in ears, nose, chest. Eye medication (liquid or ointment administered directly into the eye) - used to treat bacterial eye in-fections or \"pink eye.\" Iron (by mouth) - used to treat anemia. Cough medicine - suppressant for dry cough or ex- pectorant for wet cough. Topical medications - used to treat skin conditions such as diaper rash, infections. Medications for chronic conditions - used to treat seizure disorders, cystic \u00c0 brosis, and other chronic illnesses. Common Routes (Ways) Medication Is Given Oral medication can be solid such as tablets or cap- sules or can be liquid such as elixirs or suspensions. All oral medications should be followed by two to four ounces of water unless otherwise indicated. Eye drops require some preparation. First gather supplies (medications, tissue, gloves) and wash hands. Clean eyelids, if necessary, wearing gloves. Position child on back or if seated, with head tilted back. Gently but \u00c0 rmly pull down lower lid and in- sert medication drops into pocket formed by lower lid. Be careful not to touch the eye or eyelid with container. Wipe closed eye with tissue. Praise the child for helping and wash your hands after remov-ing the gloves. To apply eye ointment, follow the same procedure but drop a line of ointment along the lower lid, again without touching the container to the eye. Topical medications are applied to skin. First, clean the skin where you will be applying the medication. Wear gloves if directed. Apply medication using ap-plicator, gauze or gloves. Cover area if directed. Inhaled medication is delivered by a spray bottle, inhaler or nebulizer. The medication forms a \u00c0 ne mist to be inhaled. A nasal spray is fairly easy to ad-minister in older children who can cooperate. Ask them to hold one nostril closed while you squirt and they inhale the medication into the open nos-tril. Medication delivered by an inhaler or nebulizer requires special training from the parent or health care provider and speci \u00c0 c written instruction and warnings. The nebulizer is a machine that requires special cleaning after each use and instructions on its use must be provided by the parent and health care provider. There is a form available from CCL that discusses the appropriate training. Injected medication is delivered through a syringe/ needle. At this time, child care providers cannot in-ject medications such as insulin, with the exception of using an Epi-Pen \u00ae after receiving training. How- ever, CCL regulations allow child care providers to do a blood test for children with diabetes that in-volves a \u00c0 nger prick, although very strict training and guidelines from CCL must be followed. Tips for Administering Medication by Age For Infants Assemble all supplies within reach\u2014medication, tissues, measuring devices\u2014and wash your hands. Measure the correct amount of medication. If you are not able to hold the infant and give the medica-tion at the same time, ask for help. Talk to the infant and gently touch his or her mouth with the dropper or medication syringe. If his or her mouth doesn't open, gently pull down the chin. Make smacking sounds with your mouth to model what you want. When the infant's mouth is open, place the dropper or syringe on the middle of the tongue and slowly drop the medication a little at a time. If the infant does not cooperate, gently slide the dropper or sy-ringe between the inside of cheek and gums and slowly drop in medication. Or, try dropping pre-measured amount of medication into a bottle nipple and let the infant suck it up. For Toddlers and Preschoolers Follow the same preparation as for infants, but try to prepare toddlers by letting them know you are go-ing to be giving medication and you will need their help. Pre-measured medication may be placed in a spoon or in a small cup. If they are cooperative they may not need your help and will do it themselves; if not, you may have to \u00c0 rmly hold them while you use a dropper or medication syringe to place medi-cation in the mouth between cheek and gums. Allow time for the medication to be slowly swallowed. Al-ways praise children for their cooperation.Preventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n31Medication Storage Medications should always be stored in their origi- nal container in a secure place out of the reach of children. Refrigerated medication should be stored in a plastic or zip-lock bag in the food section of the fridge. Storing medication in clear plastic containers where it can be seen will help providers remember to give it. Do not freeze medication. If the medica-tion is left unrefrigerated for a long period of time, check with a pharmacist to see if it is still effective. Reactions Children may react to the medications you admin-ister. Typical reactions include rashes, tiredness and irritability. It's also very common for children to have diarrhea during antibiotic treatment, although as long as it can be contained in the pants or diaper there is no reason to exclude a child for this kind of diarrhea. If you have any concerns about a reaction, notify the parent and seek advice from the health care provider or pharmacist. Special Situations A number of situations may arise related to admin-istering medication in child care: Parents may ask you to give their child herb- al remedies. Because many remedies are not standardized, it's best not to give them unless they are properly labeled and prescribed by a licensed health care provider. Suggest that par-ents administer these at home instead. Parents may not want to reveal what condition their child has. You must respect their desire for con\u00c0 dentiality, but you still need to know if there are any medication reactions to watch for. Re- member that a child's medication or health con-dition cannot be discussed with anyone without the parent's permission. You may unexpectedly need to give children a fever-reducing medication or something for pain if they become sick during the day. In these cases, it's acceptable to get telephone permis-sion from a parent to follow the manufacturers' instructions for over-the-counter medication. You must then get written permission when the parent picks up the child. Antibiotic Resistance The overuse of antibiotics for the treatment of child-hood illnesses has created a serious public health problem. Some antibiotics no longer work with cer-tain illnesses because the bacteria are now resistant to the effects of the drug. You can help address this problem by educating parents on proper antibiotic use. Two main types of germs\u2014bacteria and virus- es\u2014cause illness. Most illnesses in child care are caused by viruses. Antibiotics are not useful for illnesses caused by viruses such as colds, coughs or the \u00c1 u. (FDA, 2002). Encourage parents not to demand antibiotics when their health care pro-vider determines it isn't necessary. Suggest that they ask about ways to help relieve symptoms instead. Administer medication exactly as prescribed. This means taking it for as long as it's prescribed until it is gone, even if the child feels better. Don't take leftover antibiotics, expired antibiot- ics, or antibiotics prescribed for someone else. Parents may forget to give prescribed medica- tions to their child. This is especially common for children with ear infections who must take antibiotics for 10 days even though they may feel and act healthy sooner. When you admin-ister medication to the child each day, you may notice from the level of medication in the bottle that it's not being given at home. You can stress the importance of the 10-day period needed for the antibiotic to completely eliminate the bac-teria which have caused the infection. Remind parents that giving an incomplete cycle of anti-biotics can make the germs resistant to antibiot-ics in the future. Working with a Pharmacist or Health Care Provider Patient information sheets on medications provide a wealth of information. They may be obtained free from pharmacies with each prescription and for non-prescription drugs upon request, or downloaded from www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html. The sheets describe how the drug works, what to do if a dose is forgotten, and which side effects might occur. Request that parents bring the infor-mation sheet with the medication so the child care staff will be more informed, but don't hesitate to ask questions of the prescribing health care provider or pharmacist if you need more information.32nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesMedication Safeguards California Childcare Health Program 1333 Broadway, Suite 1010 CA 94612-1926 Telephone 510-839-1195 Fax 510-839-0339 Healthline 1-800-333-3212 www.ucsfchildcarehealth.orgSafeguards To Prevent Errors Assign a staff member to administer medications at the right time. Consult with the parent, pharmacist or health care provider if uncertain about the next dose. If a medication is crucial and has been left at home, ask the parent to return home and get medication before the child is admitted for the day. Establish a system for ensuring that medi-cations are returned each day to the family for use at home. Develop systems to alert all staff members that a child has medication\u2014something as simple as a red dot next to a child's name on the sign-in sheet can be a good reminder. Set an alarm clock for the times of administra- tion. Use measuring devices such as medicine caps or oral syringes for liquid medications, rather than household utensils, which are not accurate. Read the measured amount at eye level. Do not accept medication without written, un- derstandable instructions. Check with a phar-macist or the child's health care provider if the instructions con \u00c1 ict with the label. Require that prescribed medication must have the child's name and current date. Make certain that medication is always admin- istered by trained staff who know the children. Always provide written noti \u00c0 cation of medica- tion administered so that the parent or other care-givers will know when to give the next dose. If a medication error is made, notify the parent immediately and consider seeking advice from the child's pharmacist or health care provider.

Germscausing infection may be present in human waste (urine, stool) and body fluids(saliva, nasal discharge, drainage from lesions or in- juries, eye discharge, vomitand blood). Infected persons may carry communicable diseases with-out having symptoms, andthey may be contagious be- fore they experience symp- toms. Child care staff need toprotect themselves and the children by routinely cleaning and disinfecting exposed ar-eas. Gloves should be worn when cleaning up blood, and hands should be washed any time body fluids are touched. Sincechildren will touch any surface they can reach, all surfaces may be contaminated. Therefore, all surfaces must be properly cleaned and sanitized. Cleaning Prior to using a bleach solution to sanitize, remove dirt and debris such as blood, urine, vomit, stool, food, dust or fingerprints by scrubbing and washingwith detergent and rinsing well with water . Routine cleaning with an all-purpose liquid de- tergent or abrasive cleanser gets rid of the dirt you can see. Scrubbing physically reduces the number of germs on surfaces (as when we washour hands). Use a disposable cloth or one that can be washed after each use, so that you don'tmove germs from one place to another. Sponges are not recommended as they harbor bacteria and are difficult to clean. Some items and sur- faces should receive an additional step, disinfection , to kill germs after cleaning with detergent and rinsingwith clear water. Carpeting should be vacu- umed daily (when childrenare not present) and sham- pooed at least every three months. Carpets should becleaned monthly in infantareas. Carpet cleaning must be done when children are not present to avoid fumesand allow the carpet to dry. Use a cleaning method ap- proved by the local healthauthority. Sanitizing or disinfecting After cleaning, you can eliminate virtually all germsleft on surfaces through the use of a chemical, such asa germicide or chlorine, or a physical agent such as heat. In the child care setting, a solution of 1/4 cup household liquid chlorine bleach added to 1gallon of cool tap water (or 1 tablespoon bleach to 1 quart of water) prepared fresh daily is an effective disinfectant. Disinfecting with bleachis NEVER effective unless the surface has been thoroughly cleaned first. Apply disinfectant solution by spraying from a spray bottle, wiping with a cloth rinsed in dis-infectant solution, or by dipping the object intoDo not mix household bleach with other household chemicals such as toilet cleaners, rust removers, acids or products containing ammonia. Mixing these chemicals with bleach will produce harmful gases.34nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesArea Clean Sanitize Frequency Countertops/tabletops, floors, doors and cabinet handles X X Daily and when soiled Food preparation and service surfaces X X Before and after food activity; between prep of raw/cookedfoods Cribs and crib mattresses X X Weekly, before use by a different child and when soiled or wet Utensils, surfaces and toys that go into the mouth or X X After each child's use, or use have been in contact with saliva or other body fluids disposab le, one-time utensils or toys Toilet bowls, seats and handles, door knobs, floors X X Daily or immediately if soiled Hand washing sinks, faucets, surrounding counters, X X Daily and when soiled soap dispensers, door knobs Changing tables, potty chairs (use of potty chairs in child X X After each child's use care is discouraged because of high risk of contamination) the solution. Allow object or surface to air dry for at least two minutes before wiping it and/ or using it again. Hand-washed dishes must always be cleaned and disinfected after each use using bleach water only.Pacifiers and manipulatives can go in the dish- washer in a mesh bag on the upper level and heat dried to be disinfected. Items that can gothrough the dishwasher or washing machine cycle are disinfected if the water is hot enough to kill the germs (160\u00ba F). Washable cloth toys and other items can be machine-washed and ma- chine heat-dried. Household bleach with water is recommended because it is effective, economical, convenient and readily available. However, to avoid fumes,corrosion and color loss on some surfaces, you may look for a commercial product which is a \"quaternary ammonium\" and dilute accordingto the label instructions. Some of the newer products have a detergent in them and can be used to clean and disinfect in one step if there is no gross contamination with food particles,meat juices, blood or dirt. If these are present, cleaning first is still required. Good ventilation is always important, especially in enclosed areas (such as bathrooms) and where chemicals are stored. Chemical air fresheners may cause nausea or allergic responses in somechildren and should never be used. Note: We urge our readers to obtain more com- prehensive information on cleaning and disinfection from \"Caring for Our Children\" and from the CCHP Prevention of Infectious Dis- easeCurriculum.

The child with a runny nose and stuffiness is a famil- iar problem in the child care setting. The nose is lined or covered by a delicate tissue called \"mucosa\" which produces mucus (sticky, slippery secretions) to pro-tect the nose. If this tissue is irritated, it swells up, causing blockage and a lot of mucus. Sometimes chil- dren get repeated runny noses or permanent snifflesand a green nasal discharge, which are uncomfort- able conditions for the child as well as child care provider. What causes the runny nose? 1.The common cold is the most typical cause of a runny nose and chronic runny nose. This is generally a mild illness, and the child feels and looks well oth- erwise. The child usually gets better on his own withina week. The runny nose is usually accompanied by a mild fever. There may also be other symptoms such as headache, sore throat, coughing, sneezing, wateryeyes, and fatigue. Children with the common cold usually get better on their own within a week. 2.Allergies can also cause a runny nose. They usually occur after two years of age and after the child has had plenty of exposure to allergens (the substances that can produce allergic reaction in the body). Theymight occur during a specific season or after a par- ticular exposure\u2014for example, after being around grass or animals. The child may also have watery anditchy eyes, sneezing, asthma, rubbing of the nose and a lot of clear mucus. With allergies, the runny nose may last for weeks or months, but there is no fever orspread of disease to others.3.Bacterial infection (sinus infection) may occasion- ally develop and contribute to the continuation of illness. This additional infection of the common cold tends to cause yellow-greenish mucus and sometimespain that continues for more than 10 days. Remember that yellow or green mucus does not always mean that a child has a bacterialinfection. It is normal for the mucus to get thickand change color as common viral coldprogresses. Is green mucus more of a concern than clear mucus? In most cases green nasal mucus (usually found to- ward the end of the cold) is not more contagious than clear mucus and may even be less contagious. The runny nose usually starts with clear mucus which thenbecomes whitish or greenish as the cold dries up and gets better. This happens because as the body mounts its defenses against the virus, the white blood cellsenter the mucus and give it the green color. Usually the green mucus is in smaller amounts and thicker, a sign that the cold is \"drying up\" and ending. Green runny nose that lasts for more than 10 to 14 days, and that may be accompanied byfever, headache, cough and foul-smellingbreath, might be a sign of sinus infection. Thechild should have a medical evaluation andmay need antibiotic treatment. When are children contagious? The amount of virus present is usually highest two to three days before a person develops symptoms of theillness and continues to be present for two to three days after symptoms begin. As a result, infected chil-36nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health Advocatesdren have already spread viruses before they begin to feel ill. If a person is infected, how is the infection spread? Germs may be spread to others by: wiping a nose and then touching other people and objects before washing hands; sharing of mouthed toys by infants and toddlers; coughing and sneezing into the air; kissing on the mouth; and poor ventilation. How can we limit the spread of infection? To prevent the spread of infection from respiratory illnesses and runny noses, follow routine healthy practices: Avoid contact with mucus as much as possible. Make sure that all children and staff use good handwashing practices, especially after wiping or blowing noses, after contact with any nose, throator eye secretions, and before preparing or eating food. Do not allow food to be shared. Clean and disinfect all mouthed toys and frequently used surfaces on a daily basis. Wash eating utensils carefully in hot, soapy water, then disinfect and air dry. Use a dishwasher when- ever possible. Use disposable cups whenever pos- sible. Make sure that the facility is well ventilated and that children are not crowded together, especially during naps on floor mats or cots. Open the win-dows and play outside as much as possible, even in the winter. Teach children to cough and sneeze into their el- bow, wipe noses using disposable tissues, throw the tissue into the wastebasket, and wash their hands.When should a child stay home? Exclusion policies should be based on your general illness policies, not merely the color of the mucus. For example, you might decide to exclude any child whois too sick to participate, no matter what the cause or color of the discharge. Excluding children with runny noses and mild respi- ratory infections and colds is generally not recommended. As long as the child feels well, canparticipate comfortably and does not require a level of care that would jeopardize the health and safety of other children, he or she can be included. Exclusion is of little benefit since viruses are likely to be spread even before symptoms haveappeared. When should a child be sent home or seen by a health provider? When the child looks sick, has a rash, has a fever over 102 degrees (oral), or has difficulty breathing or seems to be in pain. When a child complains or earache and/or is pull- ing at his or her ears, which might be accompanied by fever and fussiness (all possible signs of ear in- fection). When a child has redness, sores and crusting of the skin around the nose and mouth. When an infant, especially under 4 months of age, does not get better in a couple of days or gets worse.

Universal precautions is the term used for the guidelines that were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the 1980s to re-duce the spread of infection to health care providers and patients in health care settings. Standard precautions is the new term used for an expansion of universal precautions, recognizing that any body \u00c1 uid may hold contagious germs. They are still primarily designed to prevent the spread of bloodborne disease (disease carried by blood or other body \u00c1 uids), but are also excellent measures to prevent the spread of infectious disease in group care settings such as child care facilities. Why are standard precautions needed? Standard precautions are designed to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease from both rec-ognized and unrecognized sources of infections. Germs that are spread through blood and body \u00c1 u- ids can come at any time from any person. You may not know if someone is infected with a virus such as hepatitis B or HIV , and the infected person may not even know. This is why you must behave as if every individual might be infected with any germ in all situations that place you in contact with blood or body \u00c1 uids. What do standard precautions consist of? Standard precautions include the following: Hand washing after diapering or toileting children after handling body \u00c1 uids of any kind before and after giving \u00c0 rst aid (such as clean-ing cuts and scratches or bloody noses) after cleaning up spills or objects contaminated with body \u00c1 uids after taking off your disposable gloves remember that wearing gloves does not mean that you don't have to wash your hands! Latex gloves should be worn during contact with blood or body \u00c1 uids which contain blood (such as vomit or fe ces which con-tain blood you can see) when individuals have cuts, scratches or rashes which cause breaks in the skin of their hands Environmental sanitizing should be done regularly and as needed. In the child care setting this means cleaning toys, surfaces and diapering areas with a bleach solution (1 table spoon of bleach per quart of water made fresh daily). Blood spills or objects with blood on them need a stronger solution of 1/4 cup bleach to 2 1/2 cups water. (Donowitz, 1999). Wear gloves when handling blood. Proper disposal of materials that are soaked in or caked with blood requires double bagging in plastic bags that are securely tied. Send these items home with the child, or if you wash them, wash them sep-arately from other items. Items used for procedures on children with special needs (such as lancets for \u00c0 nger sticks, or sy ringes for injections given by par- ents) require a special container for safe disposal. Parents can provide what is called a \"sharps con-tainer\" which safely stores the lan cets or needles until the parent can take them home for disposal. Standard precautions in child care settings vs. hospitals and clinics Child care facilities follow the standard precautions in clinic and hospital settings with the following exceptions:38nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesCalifornia Childcare Health Program 1333 Broadway, Suite 1010 Telephone 510-839-1195 Fax 510-839-0339 Healthline 1-800-333-3212 www.ucsfchildcarehealth.org Use of nonporous gloves is optional except when blood or blood-containing body \u00c1 uids may be involved. Gowns and masks are not required. Appropriate barriers include materials such as disposable diaper table paper, disposable tow-els and surfaces that can be sanitized in group care settings. What else am I required to do? The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also requires that all child care programs with staff (even family child care homes with assis-tants or volunteers) have an Exposure Control Plan for Bloodborne Pathogens . This plan must be in writing and include: Exposure determination . This is a list of the job titles or duties which might put an indi vidual in contact with blood or blood-containing \u00c1 uids (such as \u00c0 rst aid, nose blowing, diaper ing, etc.) Methods of compliance. These are the ways you will assure your plan will work and which include written standard precautions and cleaning plans, training of staff in their use, and the avail ability of gloves. Hepatitis B vaccination. This must be offered by the employer at no cost to staff. The vaccine se ries can begin either within 10 days of employment, or within 24 hours after a potential blood ex posure (accidental contact with blood while administer-ing\u00c0 rst aid, diapering an infant with a bloody stool, etc.) Note: Hepatitis B is a series of three shots which must be given on a spe ci \u00c0 c schedule. Now that all children are required to have the series before en tering care, child care providers should be at a reduced risk of getting hepati tis B in a child care setting. Exposure reporting procedures. These are required and will tell staff what to do if some thing happens which puts an employee in contact with blood on their broken skin (cuts, scratches, open rashes or chapped skin) or on their mucous membranes (in the eye, mouth or nose). There are also record-keeping require ments to document the exposure situation, whether or not the employee received a free medi-cal exam and follow-up, and that the em ployee was offered the hepatitis B vaccination if she/he did not already have the series. Training on OSHA regulations. This must be pro- vided to all staff at the time that they start work and must include: an explanation of how HIV (which causes AIDS) and HBV (which causes hepatitis B) are trans-mitted an explanation of standard precautions and the exposure control plan for your program. For more information on OSHA requirements, con- tact the Cal/OSHA Consultation Service of \u00c0 ce listed in your telephone directory, or call the Healthline at (800) 333-3212 for a referral to the of \u00c0 ce nearest you.

Vaccines are rigorously tested for safety before being used routinely. Because of vaccines, devastating dis-eases like Haemophilus influenzae type B meningitis, pneumoccal meningitis, polio and pertussis are now un- common in young children who have been vaccinated.Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases still occur in areas where groups of parents are choosing not to immunize their children, such as the pertussis outbreakthat occurred in Davis, California, in 2002 and the measles outbreak that occurred in Seattle, Washington, in 2001. Some children are not immunized for medicalreasons such as allergies, or because of the parents' re- ligious or personal beliefs. Unimmunized children and staff run the risk of getting seriously ill or even dying from vaccine-preventable diseases. Immunization Requirements for Child Care in California Children are required by the California School Immu- nization Law to be appropriately immunized against diseases prior to attending licensed child care and school settings. Immunization requirements applyequally to both child care centers and licensed family child care programs. Parents must present their child's immunization record to the child care provider beforeenrollment. Providers are required to assess children's immunization status and transfer each child's immu- nization record to a California School ImmunizationRecord or \"blue card,\" which is available free of charge from the Immunization Coordinator at your local health department. Providers are also required to fol-low up with children who are incomplete until they have completed all required immunizations. Can a Child be Exempted from Immunization Requirements? There are two situations where California law allows a child to be exempted from the immunization require- ments.Medical Exemptions A medical exemption is granted when a child should not get some or all shots for temporary or permanent medical reasons. If a child has a temporary medical condition which rules out one or more immunizations, or their physician wishes to delay an immunization, a child can be tem- porarily exempted from the re quirement. To receive a Temporary Medical Exemption, the parent must pro-vide a statement from a physician (preferably on let- terhead), stating which immunizations the child cannot have at this time, why, and when the immunizations(s)will be given. The letter of exemption must be attached to the immunization \"blue card\" and the follow-up date should be noted. It is the child care provider's responsibil- ity to follow up before the exemption expires . The child must either receive the immunization(s) needed or another Temporary Medical Exemption when the current oneexpires. If a child has a medical condition that permanently rules out one or more immunizations, the child can be exempted from the immunization requirement. To grant a Permanent Medical Exemption, the parentmust provide a statement from a physician stating that there is a medical condition which permanently rules out immunization(s), and which immunization(s) thechild cannot receive. The letter of exemption must be attached to the immunization \"blue card.\" Religious and Personal Beliefs Exemptions If immunization is against a family's religious or per- sonal beliefs, they are asked to sign the Personal BeliefsAffidavit on the back of the \"blue card.\" By signing the affidavit, parents acknowledge that if there is an outbreak of any disease their child is not protectedagainst, the child may be temporarily excluded from attending child care. However, the Personal Beliefs Ex- emption is to be granted to parents only for reasons ofpersonal belief, and not as a matter of convenience because a parent can't find the immunization record, or does not \"have time\" to take the child to get immunized .40nPreventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesCalifornia Childcare Health Program 1333 Broadway, Suite 1010 Telephone 510-839-1195 Fax 510-839-0339 Healthline 1-800-333-3212 www.ucsfchildcarehealth.orgNOTE: Under California law, child care providers cannot legally exclude those whom they know areunimmunized or under-immunized for medical orre- ligious/personal reasons that are properly documented. If the parent provides documentation for medical ex-emption and/or signs the Personal Beliefs Affidavit on the back of the \"blue card\" then they are protected by law and may not be excluded from child care. What is the Risk? An outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases can have serious consequences. Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a threat, can be difficult to treat, and some-times can be deadly. Immunizations have proven very effective in significantly lowering the risk of getting sick or dying from a vaccine-preventable disease. Achild who is not immunized is at greater risk of catch- ing a vaccine-preventable disease AND infecting others. The greatest risk is to infants who have notyet received all of their immunizations, the elderly, persons who cannot be immunized for medical rea- sons or have immune system problems, and the smallpercentage of children whose immunizations failed to provide resistance. What Can Child Care Providers Do? Providers need to protect children, families, staff and themselves from serious illness, as well as protectingthemselves from potential liability. Establish an immunization tracking system to re- mind parents to bring in their child's immunization record, in order to update the \"blue card.\" It's the child care providers' responsibility to track immu-nization of the children in their care who are 2, 4, 6, 15, and 18 months and at age 4 years old until im- munizations are finished.

To help set up animmunization tracking system, acquire a copy of theCalifornia Immunization Handbook for School and Child Care, 7 th Ed., by contacting your health department's Immunization Program or online at: www.dhs.cahwnet.gov/ps/dcdc/izgroup/ handbook.htm. Provide information for parents on the importance and benefits of immunization, available at www.cdc.gov/nip and www.aap.org. Include a policy in your Parent's Handbook stat- ing that there are or may be unimmunized and/orunder-immunized children in the program. Explain what will be done in case of an outbreak of a vac- cine-preventable disease in your program. TheNational Health and Safety Standards recommends that if a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak oc- curs \" unimmunized children shall be excluded for the duration of possible exposure or until the age-appropri- ate immunizations have been completed (whichever comes first)\". 1 This is to ensure the \"protection of unimmunized and under-immunized (e.g., infants) individuals in the child care setting.\" Maintain a confidential list of children with medi- cal exemptions or personal belief affidavits so that these children can be quickly identified and ex- cluded if an outbreak occurs. Remember that all medical information, includ- ing a child's immunization status, is personal and confidential . The information given here is not to be taken as legal advice. It's a good idea to consult with legal counsel before excluding a child based on immunization sta- tus. The Child Care Law Center (www.childcarelaw.orgor 415-394-7144) is an excellent, free resource.

Parents must present their child's Immunization Record as proof of immunization. Copy the full date of each shot onto the blue Califor-nia School Immunization Record card and then determine if the child is up-to-date. Blue cards are availablefree from the Immunization Coordinator at your local health department. As the child care provider, it is your responsibility to follow up regularly until all shots are finished.REFERENCE Health and Safety Code, Division 105, Part 2, Chapter 1, Sections 120325-120380; California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Division 1, Chapter 4, Subchapter 8, Sections 6000-6075 State of California Department of Health Services Immunization Branch 2151 Berkeley Way Berkeley, CA 94704 510/540-20 65 IMM-230 TOATTEND Required 2-3 months.....................1 each of Polio, DTaP, Hib, Hep B of Polio, DTaP, Hib, Hep B6-14 months...................3 each of 15-17 months.................3 each of Polio, DTaP 2 Hep B 1 MMR, on or after the first birthday 1 1 Hib on or after the first birthday1 18 months-5 years..........3 Polio 4 DTaP3 Hep B1 MMR, on or after the first birthday 1 1 Hib on or after the first birthday1,3 1 Varicella (chickenpox)2 You may admit a child who is lacking one or more required vaccine doses if the dose(s) is not currently due on the condition that they receive the remaining dose(s) when due, according to the schedule above.

The law does notallow parents/guardians to choose an exemption simply because the \"shot\" record is lost or incomplete and it istoo much trouble to get to a physician or clinic to correct the problem. The back of the blue California School Immunization Record has instructions and an affidavit to be signed by parents who want a personal beliefs exemption. An up-to-date list of children with exemptions should be maintained separately by the child carestaff so that th ese children can be quickly identified and excluded from attendance if an outbreak occurs.Vaccines DTaP : Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis combined vaccine.

Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine. All infants should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine soon after birth and before hospital discharge; the first dosemay also be given by age 2 months if the infant's mother is hepatitis B surfaceantigen (HBsAg) negative. Only monovalent HepB can be used for the birth dose.Monovalent or combination vaccine containing HepB may be used to complete theseries. Four doses of vaccine may be administered when a birth dose is given. Thesecond dose should be given at least 4 weeks after the first dose, except forcombination vaccines which cannot be administered before age 6 weeks. The thirddose should be given at least 16 weeks after the first dose and at least 8 weeksafter the second dose. The last dose in the vaccination series (third or fourth dose)should not be administered before age 24 weeks. Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive HepB and 0.5 mL of Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth at separate sites. Thesecond dose is recommended at age 1-2 months. The last dose in theimmunization series should not be administered before age 24 weeks. Theseinfants should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) at age 9-15months. Infants born to mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown should receive the first dose of the HepB series within 12 hours of birth. Maternal blood should bedrawn as soon as possible to determine the mother's HBsAg status; if the HBsAgtest is positive, the infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible (no later than age 1 week). The second dose is recommended at age 1-2 months. The last dose in the immunization series should not be administered before age 24 weeks. 2. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. The fourth dose of DTaP may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided 6 months have elapsed since the third dose and the child isunlikely to return at age 15-18 months. The final dose in the series should be givenat age 4 years. Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) is recommended at age 11-12 years if at least 5 years have elapsed since the last dose of tetanus anddiphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. Subsequent routine Td boosters arerecommended every 10 years. 3.Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine. Three Hib conjugate vaccines are licensed for infant use. If PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB or ComVax[Merck]) is administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is notrequired. DTaP/Hib combination products should not be used for primaryimmunization in infants at ages 2, 4 or 6 months but can be used as boostersfollowing any Hib vaccine. The final dose in the series should be given at age 12 months.4. Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). The second dose of MMR is recommended routinely at age 4-6 years but may be administered during anyvisit, provided at least 4 weeks have elapsed since the first dose and both dosesare administered beginning at or after age 12 months. Those who have notpreviously received the second dose should complete the schedule by the visit atage 11-12 years. 5. Varicella vaccine. Varicella vaccine is recommended at any visit at or after age 12 months for susceptible children (i.e., those who lack a reliable history ofchickenpox). Susceptible persons aged 13 years should receive 2 doses, given at least 4 weeks apart. 6. Pneumococcal vaccine. The heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is recommended for all children aged 2-23 months. It is also recommended for certain children aged 24-59 months. The final dose in the seriesshould be given at age 12 months. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) is recommended in addition to PCV for certain high-risk groups. See MMWR 2000;49(RR-9):1-35. 7. Influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccine is recommended annually for children aged 6 months with certain risk factors (including but not limited to asthma, cardiac disease, sickle cell disease, HIV, and diabetes), healthcare workers, andother persons (including household members) in close contact with persons ingroups at high risk (see MMWR 2004;53[RR-6]:1-40) and can be administered to all others wishing to obtain immunity. In addition, healthy children aged 6-23months and close contacts of healthy children aged 0-23 months arerecommended to receive influenza vaccine, because children in this age group areat substantially increased risk for influenza-related hospitalizations. For healthypersons aged 5-49 years, the intranasally administered live, attenuated influenzavaccine is acceptable vaccine (TIV). See MMWR 2004;53(RR-6):1-40. Children receiving TIV should be administered a dosage appropriate for their age (0.25 mL if 6-35 monthsor 0.5 mL if 3 years). Children aged 8 years who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time should receive 2 doses (separated by at least 4 weeks forTIV and at least 6 weeks for LAIV). 8. Hepatitis A vaccine. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for children and adolescents in selected states and regions and for certain high-risk groups; consultyour local public health authority. Children and adolescents in these states, regions,and high-risk groups who have not been immunized against hepatitis A can beginthe hepatitis A immunization series during any visit. The 2 doses in the seriesshould be administered at least 6 months apart. See MMWR 1999;48(RR-12):1-37.Footnotes Recommended Childhood and Adolescent Immunization Schedule UNITED STATES 2005Preventing and Managing Illness in ECE Programs nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n47Minimum Interval Between DosesCATCH-UP SCHEDULE FOR CHILDREN AGED 4 MONTHS THROUGH 6 YEARS 4 weeks if first dose given at age <12 months and current age <24 months 8 weeks (as final dose ) if first dose given at age 12 months or current age 24-59 months No further doses needed for healthy children if first dose givenat age 24 months4 weeks if current age <12 months 8 weeks (as final dose ) if current age 12 months No further doses needed for healthy children if previous dose given at age 24 months8 weeks (as final dose ) This dose only necessary for children aged 12 months-5 yearswho received 3 doses before age12 monthsDiphtheria, Varicella Haemophilusinfluenzae type b 5 Pneumococcal76 wks 6 wks Birth 12 mo 12 mo 6 wks 6 wksThe tables below give catch-up schedules and minimum intervals between doses for children who have delayed immunizations.

For children who received an all-IPV or all-oral poliovirus (OPV) series, a fourth dose is not necessary if third dose was given at age 4 years. If both OPV and IPV were given as part of a series, a total of 4 doses should be given,regardless of the child's current age. 3. HepB. All children and adolescents who have not been immunized against hepatitis B should begin the HepB immunization series during any visit. Providers should makespecial efforts to immunize children who were born in, or whose parents were born in,areas of the world where hepatitis B virus infection is moderately or highly endemic. 4. MMR. The second dose of MMR is recommended routinely at age 4-6 years but may be given earlier if desired.5. Hib. Vaccine is not generally recommended for children aged 5 years. 6. Hib. If current age <12 months and the first 2 doses were PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB or ComVax [Merck]), the third (and final) dose should be given at age12-15 months and at least 8 weeks after the second dose. 7. PCV. Vaccine is not generally recommended for children aged 5 years. 8. Td. For children aged 7-10 years, the interval between the third and booster dose is determined by the age when the first dose was given. For adolescents aged 11-18 years, the interval is determined by the age when the third dose was given. 9. IPV .Vaccine is not generally recommended for persons aged 18 years. 10. Varicella.
