Barasch says of Triphala, which is revered for its tri-doshic nourishing, cleansing, and balancing properties. Ayurvedic has looked to Triphala as a multi-purpose herbal remedy for various ailments, most notably digestive issues. It has been shown to support internal cleansing, healthy regular bowel movements, and tissue nourishment, according to various studies, while also benefiting the liver. (Some research suggests it may aid in the prevention of colon cancer.) Barasch says Triphala may also aid in weight loss, for some. AYURVEDIC HERITAGE Rather than a single herb, Triphala is actually a blend of three organic fruits native to India\u2014 bibhitaki, amalaki, and haritaki. Each fruit is chosen for its complementary wellness boosting properties. Bibhitaki is known to help with detoxification of the muscles, fatty tissue, and blood. (Bibhitaki is great for promoting balance in Kaphas.) Amalaki is rich in Vitamin C and helps to boost the immune system and lower cholesterol. And Haritaki, also abundant in vitamin C, is full of antioxidants and helps to ease inflammation, promote healing, and enhance brain function. The combination of the complementary fruits makes this polyherbal rasayana one of the most widely used in Ayurveda. Well over 5000 years ago, the ancient science of medicine\u2014Ayurveda\u2014was born, unveiling a well of profound lifestyle practices and tactics that help to prevent disease and to return one to balance. Cooking with fresh vital foods, incorporating ritualistic self-massage, and honoring one's emotional health are several of the many principles that anchor Ayurveda and continue to thrive today. Herbs, herbal formulas, and adaptogens are another fundamental aspect of Ayurveda. In India, the earliest practitioners began untapping the wisdom of plants and various earth substances. They recognized the wellness potential and healing energy found in botanicals and began cultivating and incorporating them into their routines by grounding them fresh to be taken orally, adding them to carrier oils to be applied topically, and also honoring the plant essences to be used as aromatherapy. \"The pharmacology of Ayurveda is a vast science including thousands of medicines, many of them herbal preparations,\" writes Dr. Vasant Lad. Each of these herbs have their \"own intelligence.\" They can ease aggravated dosha, support detoxification and rejuvenation, and stimulate certain systems in the body. Today, many are taking notice of these herbs, herbal formulations, and other natural substances for their star-performing wellness benefits. Ayurveda has an array of options to choose from. Some are blends of several fruits or plants and are taken as rasayanas, a general wellness-promoting tonic. Some are adaptogens, meaning their function adjusts according to the specific needs of the body, for which research is steadily growing. And others are non-plant earth substances, such as vegetable asphalts and metals. The well of healing potential is as full as it is eclectic.
