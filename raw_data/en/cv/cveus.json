Let's take a look at some of the ingredients in our ENERGY formula: - Vitamins - you'll find a variety of vitamins in our formula, including Vitamin A, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, C, and Vitamin E. ENERGY contains a high potency amount of Vitamins C, Riboflavin, B6 and B12 delivering more than 100% of your Daily Value for each. Together, these vitamins will help the body convert proteins, carbs, and fats into energy that your muscles will store for later. They can also help your brain function properly and produce mood-enhancing neurotransmitters. - Caffeine - we all know and love the effects of caffeine, but large amounts can leave you with more negative effects than positive ones. We only use 100mg of caffeine - per serving, which is enough to give you a boost, but not a caffeine crash. - L-Taurine - this naturally-produced amino acid is essential to keeping you hydrated, healthy digestion, supporting your central nervous system, and regulating your immune system. It can also improve physical performance and our ability to burn fat. - BCAAs - we've included L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine, and L-Valine in Carefast ENERGY. These three amino acids are referred to as BCAAs and play a significant role in muscle growth and muscle recovery. - Beta Carotene - this natural pigment is a precursor to Vitamin A and is stored in the liver. Our body only uses it when we need it, so having healthy levels is vital to the body. It will act as an antioxidant and boost our immune system. - Green Tea - since green tea has natural caffeine in it, many people prefer it as an alternative to the many other caffeine drinks on the market. It's also used as an extract and in powdered formulas. Directions: [*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food & Drug Administration.
