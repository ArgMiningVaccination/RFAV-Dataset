Historically in BC, CFIA's DSP testing focused on lots exported to specific international markets. CFIA has recently expanded their DSP program to include monitoring in other harvest locations. Health Canada has established limits for DSP-causing toxins ( [Canadian Standards](http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/fispoi/man/samnem/app3e.shtml)). When these regulatory limits are exceeded, effected harvest areas are closed to harvesting. All shellfish in BC must be inspected by federally registered shellfish processing plants before going to commercial market - this is part of the [Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program (CSSP)](https://inspection.canada.ca/preventive-controls/fish/cssp/eng/1563470078092/1563470123546), the federal monitoring and prevention program in Canada. The CSSP classifies harvesting areas and controls the commercial and recreational harvesting and processing of shellfish for the consumer market. The CSSP is run by 3 federal government agencies (1) Environment Canada - responsible to monitor water quality in shellfish areas, (2) Canadian Food Inspection Agency - responsible for monitoring marine toxins in shellfish areas and for registering and inspecting shellfish processing plants, and, (3) Fisheries and Oceans Canada - responsible for opening and closing harvest areas, and prohibiting shellfish harvesting when bacteriological or toxin levels are unsafe.
