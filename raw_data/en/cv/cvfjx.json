The award, presented by the [Arnold P. Gold Foundation](http://www.humanism-in-medicine.org/index.php/programs_grants/awards/leonard_tow_humanism_in_medicine), is presented to a graduating medical student and a faculty member \"who best demonstrate the Foundation's ideals of outstanding compassion in the delivery of care, respect for patients, their families and healthcare colleagues, as well as demonstrated clinical excellence.\" The faculty recipient is [Gloria Kennedy, MD](http://www.upstate.edu/gch/providers/provider_list.php?provider_id=49&name=Gloria+Kennedy), assistant professor of pediatrics and an attending physician in the department of Pediatrics in the [Center for Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders](http://www.upstate.edu/hospital/providers/locations/?clinicID=893) at Upstate University Hospital. \"Gold Humanism is such a wonderful organization, and it means so much to be acknowledged for all the time and energy I've devoted to our projects this year,\" Connie said. Dr. Kennedy earned her MD from Upstate in 1989, completed her residency here in pediatrics as well as a fellowship in pediatric hematology/oncology. She specializes in pediatric brain tumors, hemophilia and [von Willebrand Disease](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/vwd/), a bleeding disorder. Connie earned a biology degree from SUNY Geneseo, then spent a year as an Emergency Medical Technician for Rural/Metro Medical Services in her hometown of Rochester before coming to Upstate. Connie has served as chief coordinator for Upstate's international health clinic, president of the Gold Humanism Honor Society and a member of [Alpha Omega Alpha](http://www.upstate.edu/currentstudents/campuslife/activities/student_organizations/so_aoa.php) Honor Society. Last year, she helped lead a workshop at the [Pediatric Academic Society's annual meeting in Boston](https://blogs.upstate.edu/withdistinction/2012/07/16/medical-student-represents-upstate-at-national-meeting/) showcasing Upstate's international health clinic. This year, Connie and her Gold Humanism colleagues created and implemented a humanism curriculum for third-year medical students. \"My classmates and I developed a clerkship-specific discussion series,\" she said. \"It's tailored to MS3s and designed to emphasize the role of humanism in patient care and increase student sensitivity to the issues, both medical and non-medical, that shape patient attitudes and experiences. \"The hospital can be such a frightening, confusing place for students and patients,\" Connie said. \"I think that the curriculum we developed has the potential to make student-patient interactions more compassionate and to improve the Upstate hospital experience for everyone.\" After graduation, Connie will return to Rochester for her Emergency Medicine residency at Strong Memorial Hospital.
