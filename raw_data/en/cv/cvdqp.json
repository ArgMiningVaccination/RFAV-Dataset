The purpose of this survey was to quantify existing oxygen delivery and pro duction equipment, consumables for administering oxygen therapy, bed capacity, and facility infrastructure characteristics that are relevant to providing respiratory care. Primary, secondary, and tertiary health care facilities designated for COVID -19 trea tment , as well as newly developed temporary COVID -19 treatment sites , were included in the sample . This report summarizes observations from the collected data and provides a unique resource for understanding COVID -19 treatment capacity in Senegal's health facilitie s. Information was collected to enable evidence -based decisions on allocation of the limited quantities of respiratory care equipment available to treat patients affected by COVID -19 and other respiratory illness es. By documenting the current availability of equipment and modeling the requirements in Senegal, the data reported here can enable stakeholders to engage in specific actions to meet the country's needs. The result s indicated that i ntensive care unit bed capacity was a key constraining factor to ox ygen therapy across most COVID -19 treatment centers . The data also revealed significant scarcity of oxygen delivery equipment across Senegal, with available oxygen equipme nt often totaling far less than the number of reported beds. Available critical oxyge n delivery and production equipment was highly concentrated in the capital , Dakar. For instance , of 77 functional ventilators reported across all surveyed COVID -19 treatme nt centers, 84% were held by facilities in Dakar \u2014this despite Dakar making up only 23% of Senegal's current population. There was also a lack of basic durable and consumable equipment to deliver medical oxygen. For instance, data show ed only 103 adult oxyg en masks across all surveyed COVID -19 treatment centers. Additionally , the distributi on of delivery equipment and vital signs monitoring equipment was not proportional across regions. This implies that safe oxygen administration and pulse ox imetry was limited in many facilities in Senegal . An immediate next step after quantifying baseline oxygen availability was to compare observed equipment totals to estimated equipment needs for a hypothetical COVID -19 scenario. This gap in oxygen and respiratory e quipment is reported as total procurement quantities by product category. Significant short falls in respiratory care consumables and durables were estimated for the scenario. For example, we estimated a shortfall exceeding 1,000 units each of oxygen masks, nasal cannulae, and nasal catheters, and more than 100 units each of pulse oximeters and p atient monitors. It will be prudent to review these estimates and develop plans to address the shortages in order to meet COVID -19 patient needs. This report and gap analysis identif ied specific needs that donors, implementing partners, country governmen ts, and other stakeholders should prioritize through policy and funding decisions that increase availabil ity of respiratory care equipment. The survey data could also enable inform ed, efficient allocation (and potentially reallocation , post the COVID -19 pa ndemic) of procured supplies . These findings and recommendations will ultimately help to ensure new equipment is placed in facilities where it can be maximally utilized . It is important to note that since data collection was completed in July 2020, additio nal equipment has been procured . Information regarding this newly procured equipment has been integrated into an ongoing PATH -led analysis of medical equipment and oxygen device inventory across 164 public health care facilities. This information will also be taken into account when developing policy and procurement recommendations.1 Surve y scope and sampling This report begins by describing the design of the facility assessments conducted, key facility characteristics (e.g., intensive care unit [ ICU] bed c ounts) observed in the data , and a discussion of other factors that could constrain C OVID -19 treatment capacity. The report then highlights observations of the current availability of oxygen delivery and respiratory care equipment, oxygen production /supply equipment, and consumables within health facilities .a Nationally, 29 COVID -19 treat ment centers were surveyed across 13 regions of Senegal . The types of facilities surveyed include d existing primary (c entre de sant\u00e9 ), secondary ( h\u00f4pital de tertiary (h\u00f4pital de niveau 3 ), and specially created new COVID -19-dedicated treatment and observation centers. A full list of the facilities visited is available in Appendix A. These facilities are expected to treat COVID -19 patients and will require the minimum equipment to care for c ritically ill patients. Overall, this data collection effort covered approximately 21% of the 137 health care facilities in Senegal (35 tier 1/2/3 hospitals and 102 health centers) , as defined in the 2019 -2028 Plan National de D\u00e9veloppement Sanitaire et Social (National Health and Social Development Plan). Figure 1 shows the number of facilities surveyed per region . More facilities were sam pled in Dakar , the national capital , which continues to be the epicenter of COVID -19 cases in Senegal , than in other regions . Figure 1. Number of facilities surveyed , by region. Data collection methods The World Health Organizat ion (WHO ) biomedical equipment for COVID -19 case management data collection toolb was adapted by PATH for use in Senegal , in collaboration with the Ministry of Health Emergency Operations Center, WHO in Senegal, and the Ministry of Health Direction of Infrastructure, Equipment and Maintenance. The questions included in the survey were informed by the WHO list of priority medical devices for COVID -19 case management.1 a. The survey data used to inform these observations can be accessed u pon a request to PATH at oxygen@path.org . b. Essential equipment for COVID -19 treatment was defined by the World Health Organization COVID -19 Essential 1 1 1 1 132129 0510152025302 The instrument was hosted on the SurveyCTO platform with data generated from it bein g used to develop this report. Data collection was organized and conducted by PATH and the Senegal Ministry of Health Emergency Operations Center. Data privacy was a priority for survey data collection and has been maintained b y encrypting and storing all data in password -protected containers during all data cleaning and analysis. Study t eams Facility data were collected over a span of 11 days . Data collection was carried out by PATH in partnership with Ministry of Health officers with significant experie nce in medical oxygen delivery. A two-day training o n the survey tool was conducted prior to the field work. All data were collected on a digital survey platform (SurveyCTO ) using tablets , and uploaded to the server on each day of the collection period . Analysis and data collection was completed by the PATH team under the supervision of Dr. Abdoulaye Ly of the Ministry of Health Emergency Operations Center. Limits of the study Data collection was done in June and July 2020. Sinc e then, additional medical equipmen t has been purchased to strengthen Senegal's health system and COVID -19 response. Information regarding this newly procured equipment has been integrated into an ongoing analysis of medical equipment and oxygen device inv entory across 164 public health care facilities supported by PATH staff in Senegal . For a more comprehensive understanding of oxygen equipment and supplies availability in Senegal , the 202 0-2024 health investment plan, 2019-2028 Plan National de D\u00e9veloppement Sanitaire et Social , and the Plan S\u00e9n\u00e9gal Emergent (Emerging Senegal Plan, a gove rnment reference document) can be consulted in addition to this report. 3 COVID -19 treatment capacity Treatment capacity was constrained principally by the number of available beds. ICU beds are especially important for the treatment of critical COVID -19 cas es, as they are equipped to provide consistent oxygen therapy at higher flow rates , as well as mechanical ventilation .c,2 Table 1 shows total and ICU bed counts across health facilities, broken down by region. Table 1. Bed counts , by region .

The higher -density regions of Dakar, Diourbel, and Thi\u00e8s ( Figure 2 below ) had the highest numbers of total available beds and total ICU beds ( Table 1). The number of ICU be ds was limited in the identified COVID -19 treatment centers in Senegal, accounting for only 4% of tot al surveyed beds (71 ICU beds/1,811 total beds) , or 0.43 beds per 100,000 people . This is in sharp contrast to the Organisation for Economic Co -operation a nd Development average of 12 ICU beds/100,000 people.3 Within Dakar, 10 of the 26 available ICU beds were located at R\u00e9animation Cuomo, an ICU -only facility designated for critical COVID -19 cases. Three regions (Kolda, Louga, and S\u00e9dhiou ), with a total population of 2 ,382,231 (see Table 2 below ), reported no ICU beds. These findi ngs suggest that overall treatment capacity for severe and critical COVID -19 patients was limited at the time of data collection by both ICU bed capacity and geographic availability of beds. c. High -flow oxygen therapy requires up to 70 liters per minute . 4 Figure 2. Senegal population density , by region .

Characteristics such as the type of electricity source can limit treatment capacity if using oxygen delivery devices that require power, such as oxygen concentrato rs. ICU beds that rely on piped medical oxygen may be cons trained by the number of wall units installed in that ward. Furthermore, oxygen therapy and patient ventilation require trained clinical staff, including specialized training to safely intubate pati ents. Tables 3 through 5 summarize collected data on elect ricity sources, use of piped oxygen , and health facility staff. Table 3. Electricity sources across facilities .

About half of the facilities surveyed reported having a piping system for medical oxygen . Among the subset of 19 facilities with a pressure swing adsorption ( plant, Hospitalier R\u00e9gional de Ziguinchor \u2014lacked piping systems. Just more than half of facilities (16/29, 55%) reported havin g staff with experience with mechanical ventilation or intubation ; however, the number of trained staff per facility was not quantified . Subsequent data collection, using the WHO assessment of human resources for healthd to understand human resource s const raints , could be deployed to learn more about these needs. This survey could also assess the skills capacity for each facility to effec tively assess the quality of the management, maintenance, and installation of the equipment. d WHO Assessment of Human Resources for Health: https://www.who.int/hrh/tools/hrh_assessment_guide.pdf?ua=1 6 Oxygen delivery equipment The facility survey quantified existing functional and nonfunctional respiratory care equipment of various device types. The following ty pes of equipment facilitate the delivery of oxygen therapy to the patient, and include ventilators, pulse oximeters, and patient monitors. Ventilators Ventilators pump air with supplemental oxygen into a patient's airways in cases of severe respiratory distress during which they are unable to breathe on their own .4 Ventilators require a patient to be intubated. They have be en instrumental in keeping critically ill patients alive . The survey team collected data on various types , including portable ventilators , pediatric intensive care ventilators, and adult intensive care ventilators . Figure 3 quantif ies functional ventilators by type, across the surveyed regions . It is important to note that proper intubation and operation of a ventilator requires a high level of training and patient supervision. Figure 3. Functional ventilato rs, by type and region . Only 77 functional ventilators were r eported across all 29 surveyed COVID -19 treatment centers . Thirteen facilities reported carrying functional ventilators with the remaining 16 possessing none. Additionally, ventilators were une qually distributed across the regions : 84% (65/77) of all repor ted ventilators were deployed at facilities in Dakar. Facilities surveyed in six regions (Kaffrine, Kaolack, Kolda, This findi ng implies that none of the 15 reported ICU beds across those regions had mechanical ventilation capabilities. Five additional ventilators, all located in Dakar, were reported to be nonfunctional. Procuring additional ventilators may allow more critically ill patients to be treated ; however, it is important to note that these devices are expensive and require sign ificant staff training and maintenance . Among the 13 facilities with ventilators, 9 reported having staff trained on invasive ventilation techniq ues. Hence, even if ventilators are available in the remaining 4 facilities, there may not be appropriate staff to use them. Moreover , patient monitors and pulse oximeters should be procured and paired with these devices for safe oxygen administration. Increasing the number of staff 0102030405060 Portable Adult Intensive Care Pediatric Intensive Care7 trained in invasive mechanical ventilation and intubation would increase the number of patients with access to this critical potentially lifesaving treatment . Pulse oximeters Pulse oximeters and multimodal devices (patient moni tors equipped with functions such as electrocardiogram [ ECG ], oxygen saturation , etc.) are critical to safe oxy gen administration .e These devices help to monitor the level of oxygen in a patient's blood and alert the health care worker if the oxygen level drops below a safe threshold . This allows for timely identification of hypoxemia and an opportunity for a heal th care worker to intervene and prevent a patient from decompensating further and risking vital organ damage . These devices are essential in any s etting in which a patient receives oxygen \u2014surgery, emergency and intensive care, treatment, and recovery \u2014and for treatment o f respiratory disease s, including but not limited to COVID -19. The survey team collected data on three type s of pulse oximeters: fingertip, tabletop, and ha ndheld. Fingertip and handheld devices were the most common across facil ities; however , the total count of devices was low, considering it is recommended that pulse oximetry be available when administering oxygen therapy .5 Similar t o ventilators , pulse oximeters were unequally distributed across facilities, with 62% (103/165) being held by facilities in Dakar (Figure 4). Facilities in the regions of Diourbel, Kaffrine, and Kolda reported no inventory of pulse oximeters . Figure 4. Functional pulse oximeters , by type and region . Patient monitors Similar to pulse oximeters, patient monitors provide measurements of patient vital signs that are critical for health care workers to make ef fective decisions on patient car e, including deliver y of oxygen therapy. There were two types of patient monitors surveyed: monitors with integrated ECG and monitors without ECG. Figure 5 compares counts of patient monitors by type across regions and natio nally. e. Recent studies have suggested that clinical guidance should include consideration of the effect of skin pigmentation on pulse oximetry measurement accuracy. As pulse oximetry is expanded, ef forts should be made to identify and disseminate the most recent clinical recommendations for patient care, to effectively treat all patients: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2029 240. 0102030405060 Tabletop Handheld Fingertip8 Figure 5. Functional patient monitors , by type and region . Abbreviation: ECG, electrocardiogram. Patient monitors with integrated ECG were significantly more prevalent in health facilities than monitors without ECG. This is helpful to note, a s it might demonstrate that ECG is a desired device feature. Similar to pulse oximeters and ventilators, the majority of patient monitors (71%) were held by facilities in Dakar \u2014despite the survey showing Dakar as having only 45% of fac ilities and 51% of beds. This shows patient monitors were unequally distributed across facilities and that there was a significant need to procure both pulse oximeters and patient monitors to increase the ability to safely administer oxygen therapy. Such i ncreases would, howev er, need to be paired with the requisite staffing and training . The survey team also collected data on several other device types that facilitate oxygen therapy , including bilevel positive airway pressure , high-flow nasal cannula , and suction devices. Observations on these devices are not included here but can be requested from PATH. 0102030405060 Monitor with integrated ECG Monitor without integrated ECG9 Oxygen production equipment and supply This section quantifies equipment that can produce and store oxygen for patient care. This includes oxygen c oncentr ators and PSA plants, which can purify atmospheric oxygen for medical use, as well as oxygen cylinders , which store medical oxygen. With the exception of S\u00e9dhiou, where a PSA plant is planned for construction, all surveyed regions have at least one PSA oxy gen plant . Dakar , the national capital, has eight plants. Liquid oxygen is not available in any of the COVID -19 treatment centers in Senegal. Table 6 summarizes the availability of oxygen equipment in the surveyed regions . Table 6.

Safe delivery of oxygen is highly dependent on availability of equipment such as fl owmeters and hu midifiers, as well as consumables such as nasal cannulae and oxygen masks. 10 Oxygen concentrators Oxygen concentrators are devices that take in ambient air, compress the air , and filter out nitrogen to supply purified oxygen. These devices all ow for provision of oxygen to patients in wards without centralized piping systems and can be easily moved. However, concentrators require a reliable source of electricity to function. Ox ygen provided via concentrators in certain circumstances can be share d between multiple patients depending on concentrator model , output volume , and patient type . Although concentrators provide a reliable source of oxygen, they are dependent on electricity and require regular maintenance to provide quality oxygen, which oft en pose challenges for their use in facilities as these devices age . The survey team collected data on oxygen concentrators of various sizes , including 3, 5, 8, 10 , and greater than 10 liters per minute ( LPM). Table 7 shows the num ber of functional and nonfunctional oxygen concentrators by region, as well as the national total. Table 8 shows the distribu tion of functional oxygen concentrators by type, by region. Table 7.

Oxygen concentrators of size 5 LPM, which are suitable for most patients, were the most prevalent across all surveyed regions . For severe and critical COVID -19 patients , WHO recommends high flow rates (upward of 10 LPM). Dakar is the only region to report concentrators with more than 5 LPM capacity (2/12 ). Overall, high-flow concentrators (>5 LPM) were in short supply across all regions . Oxygen cylinde rs Oxygen cylinders are metal canisters that require regular refill s at a centralized depots or facility - based plants with cylinder filling capacity, and require routine distribution, often over long distances. They require minimal maintenance and no elect ricity, making them a suitable oxygen source in some settings with insufficient infrastructure (e.g., access to reliable electricity) . However, to be of any value in providing oxygen therapy , a reliable, consistent supply chain and logistic s system should be in place to provide refills . Like other ox ygen delivery and production devices, they depend on availability of oxygen consumables, such as masks, tubing , and cylinder assembly units to facilitate oxygen delivery. The facility assessment established tha t the total number of cylinders in Senegal am ong surveyed facilities was limited , with only 25 cylinders reported nationwide. Moreover, a majority of the cylinders (13/25) were located at facilities in Dakar. Given low cylinder and concentrator counts, it is possible that facilities rel ied primarily on oxygen generated by the co -located PSA plant to meet oxygen needs. 12 It is important to note , however , that 13 facilities report ed no piping infrastructure and thus would require concentrators or cylinders to s upply oxygen to patients. Table 9 shows quantities of cylinders by size and connection type in each region. Table 9. Counts of oxygen cylinders , by size and connection type , in each region .

There was a mix of other sizes across regions . Overall, bullnose assemblies were more common than pin -index in Senegal . Pressure swing adsorpt ion plants Pressure swing adsorption plants are health facility -based f actories that use pressure to separate oxygen from the atmosphere and purify it to medical grade oxygen. They operate using the same technology as oxygen concentrators but at a much larger scale. In all, 19 of the 29 surveyed facilities reported having a ccess to an on-site PSA oxygen plant, which indicates significant reliance on PSA plants to meet oxygen needs . Table 10 highlights these 19 facilities and some key details about their PSA plants. Unfortunately, not all specifics were available for each facil ity. 13 Table 10.

Notably, H \u00f4pital Dalal Jamm ha d significantly higher capacity than other facilities , as it was the largest su rveyed facility in Dakar. Most facilities with on -site plants (15/19) reported being piped for bedside oxygen delivery . A key immediate priority would be to pipe the remaining 4 facilities to improve oxygen accessibility within a facility and reduce the ne ed for refilling of cylinders. A majority of the surveyed PSA plants were manufactured by the French company Mil's, which is certified by the International Organization for Standardization . 15 Oxygen consumables Oxygen consumables are devices or oxygen deliv ery interfaces that facilitate administration of oxygen therapy to the patient . Because consumables are not durable , reusable devices, their availability can greatly fluctuate over time. For this report, the consumable quantities observed present a snapsho t in time and could be lower or higher than average availability for an individual facility, depending on whether that facility had recently ordered new inventory. Examining consumable quantities across districts and nationally helps to stabilize this vari ation. The study did not obtain trends of consumable stockouts for facilities, and therefore cannot make observations about other important variables , such as average availability for specific consumables. Table 11 highlight s some key oxygen consumables across the regions of Senegal. Table 11. Quantities of o xygen consumables , by region .

Overall, cannula and oxygen masks were significantly more prevalent than nasal catheters at the time of the assessment. Comparing the relationship of oxygen consumables to oxygen delivery equipment is important in evaluating h ow effectivel y medical equipment is being used in facilities. For instance, if a facility has a very large number of oxygen concentrators, but very few masks for oxygen delivery, then treatment capacity is constrained. The lack of consumables reported in r egions other than Dakar is 16 highly concerning . Facilities with shortages may be forced to ration or reuse consumables, and reusing them has significant cross -contamination/cross -infection risks. Additionally, even though a facility has adequate oxygen gas s upply , withou t adequate consumables, patients may be unable to actually receive oxygen therapy. 17 Estimates of national respiratory care need s A key purpose of the biomedical facility assessment was to provide data to estimate country wide COVID -19 oxygen and respiratory care need s. The PATH team used the data to model scenarios and evaluate gaps in respiratory care availability in the sampled facilities in order to enable policymakers to make data -driven decisions regarding respiratory care equipment and med ical oxygen d istribution systems in response to COVID -19. The model estimates the gap between existing respiratory care delivery capacity in Senegal and the oxygen delivery capacity required to respond to a six -month COVID -19 outbreak at varying levels of severity. Respiratory care for COVID -19 is more complex than traditional oxygen provision. Severe and critical COVID -19 patients often require high flow rates of oxygen over prolonged period s of time , as well as mechanical ventilation. In addition, patients need to be placed under consistent surveillance by health care workers to ensure that treatment can be adjusted in the event of further decompensation. As such, a significant amount of oxy gen and durable and consumable respiratory care equipment is required. Modeled results In agreement with the Senegal COVID -19 Emergency Operations Center, a six-month hypothetical COVID -19 outbreak scenario peaking at 2 ,573 new cases per week was selected to be modeled. Under this scenario, a significant gap in available equipment to treat COVID -19 patients was estimated. Moreover, under current designated ICU capacity for critical COVID -19 patients (36 beds), the model c oncluded that a significant number of patients requiring ICU care would be unable to access it due to capacity having been reached. National oxygen production capacity was estimated to exceed predicted need, although individual facilities may still face ga ps depending on facility oxygen availability . If ICU capacity were expanded, then additional provision of oxygen would be required to account for additional patients receiving ICU care. Peak weekly oxygen need during the hypothetical outbreak was estimated at 34,372,800 liters (see Appendix B for methodology) . At this level, all 36 surveyed COVID -19-designated ICU be ds would be filled with critical patients, and 233 COVID -19-designated general beds would be filled with severe COVID -19 patients. Maximum weekly supply was estimated to be 51,984,680 liters, assuming all PSA plants were 100% operational, available cylinde rs were filled, and concentrators were functional. Figure 6 shows the hypothetical six -month outbreak that was modeled for this gap assessment. 18 Figure 6. New cases per week over a s ix-month (26 -week) hypot hetical COVID -19 outbreak scenario . predicted the number of COVID -19 cases in Senegal over the next six months by utilizing available data on cases in the country up to January 4, 2021 . Cases per week were forecasted to grow at 10% until the midpoin t of the forecasted outbreak , at which time, they would decline by a predicted 10% per week. The total number of new COVID -19 cases for the base scenario was 37,365, with a maximum of 2 ,573 ne w cases in week 13. Data on COVID -19 case progression wa s provid ed by the Senegal Ministry of Health Emergency Operations Center. The f orecasted outbreak is meant to serve as a guide for determining gap s in bed, oxygen, and equipment availability , and is not an epidemiological projection of future COVID -19 cases. Natio nal equipment, bed, and oxygen needs in this scenario were estimated using a model that presumed that 19% of active COVID -19 cases at any given point would require hospitalization ,6 and 41% o f hospitalized patients would requir e some degree of oxygen thera py.7 Of the cases that would require oxygen, 62% were presumed to be in the \"severe\" category , requiring 10 LPM of oxygen for six days . The remaining 38% were presumed to be in the \"critical\" category , requiring mechanical intubation with 30 LPM of oxygen for 14 days .8 This case flow framework was developed using available literature by PATH and input from PATH stakeholders. Further specifications of this framework are available in Appendix B. Additionally, per Emergency Operations Center guidance, only 30% of surveyed general beds and 50% of surveyed ICU beds were dedicated to COVID -19 patient care. This equates to 5 22 general beds and 36 ICU beds. Figure 8 contrasts ICU availabili ty with need over the course of the outbreak , highlighting the lack of available ICU beds. Beyond the first week of the hypothetical outbreak, there would be a shortfall in ICU bed availability. This is of significant concern , as it indicates that ICU capa city is not adequate to meet patient demand. 05001,0001,5002,0002,5003,000 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526Weekly new cases Week Scenario19 Figure 7.

The tables below outline respiratory care equipment availability nationwide at the time of the surve y and estimate the shortfall in equipment to adequately service beds at surveyed facilities . Table 12 shows durable equipment (reusable for care of multiple patients), and Table 13 shows consumable equipmen t (usable for treatment of only a single patient). As indicated in prior sections, health facilities of various levels across 13 of 14 regions of Senegal were surveyed by PATH to quantify ICU bed capacity, current oxygen production capacity , and availabili ty of essential respiratory car e equipment for treating COVID -19 patients.f Information was not collected on every piece of equipment in the essential equipment list during the biomedical equipment survey , so where data w ere unavailable, the model assumed there w ere zero pieces of that equipment type. There were significant shortages of both durable and consumable pieces of equipment , implying that despite there being adequate medical oxygen availability to manage a COVID -19 outbreak, there is limited capac ity to deliver the oxygen to patients. f.

This report provides a view into availability of oxygen delivery equipment, oxygen production equipme nt, and consumables that are critical to providing respiratory care treatment for COVID -19 and beyond. Understanding the availability of respiratory care equipment is the first step in accurately estimat ing the gap in equipment supply and understand ing health facility capabilities and limitations for treating COVID -19 patients. An overall scarcity of critical equipment and unequa l distribution across surveyed facilities was observed in Senegal . Equitable allocation of new equipment will be a more complex ta sk than simply purchasing equipment to fill the gap and then dividing it between facilities. Key recommendations for next step s: Contrast distribution of equipment observed in this report against needs in different regions and develop plans to reallocate o r procure additional equipment to address needs . Utilize the gap analysis and oxygen need estimation to develop costed operati onal plans to increase the availability of respiratory care equipment . Develop specific requests and advocacy directed to donor s and partners to backstop potential budget shortfalls. Use the WHO Assessment of Human Resources for Healthg tool to calculate human resource s constraints on the effective delivery of health care. The survey could also assess the skills capacity of each facility , allowing for insight into the quality of equipment management, installation, and maintenance. Review existing PSA infras tructure and ensure that plants are able to run at maximum capacity and have maintenance contracts in place. Further collect data on respiratory care service capacity through an expanded facility assessment.
