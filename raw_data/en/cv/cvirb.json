The most toxic area is our soil with over 3 billion tons of pesticides found by the CDC when they tested samples around the country. Everyone is full of toxins and it has been shown that we have at least 700 different toxins inside our body at any one time. Toxins enter our body every day through the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, the things we touch or apply to our face and bodies, even the medications we are prescribed. \"An Apple a Day Keeps the Doctor Away\" used to be a good phrase but now we have to start thinking about that apple being a poisoned apple due to the fact that they contain more chemicals than any other fruit. In 2012, Europe banned all American Apples due to their toxicity. Spinach and strawberries also topped the Environmental Working Group's dirty dozen foods for 2018. The most toxic crops are cotton, tobacco, and COFFEE - the most widely consumed beverage in America. So how do we get clean in such a dirty environment? The following are the things we need to avoid in our diet if we want to stay healthy in today's world. Avoid processed foods, gluten, dairy products, conventionally raised animals, farmed fish, soy products, and the \"Dirty Dozen\" produce items as determined by the Environmental Working Group. Be aware of what you are using to cook things with and storing the leftovers in. Avoid plastics to cook, store and drink from, as they contribute to a toxic estrogen burden in the body. Cook with stainless steel, ceramic, and a moderate use of cast iron is okay. Drink from stainless steel or glass. The best things to eat include organic produce, free range, grass fed, grass finished animals and wild caught fish. You can easily do this by shopping at local farmer's markets and Co-ops or finding a farmer that allow their cattle to graze and chickens to freely run around to eat bugs versus supplied corn. Drink filtered water that takes out the chemicals that are regularly placed in our water these days. A medical food detoxification program that provides the specific nutrients to allow your body to handle all these toxins is essential. Let's look closer at how the body gets rid of all those toxins so they are not stored inside of your fat cells. The liver is where your body takes in the toxins you are exposed to (all are fat soluble) and runs them through Phase 1, Phase 2, and eventually brought to the kidney in Phase 3 to be excreted out of the body safely. The problem with most people's detoxification process is that Phase 1 is going too fast due to the medications we take as well as the coffee and alcohol we drink. Phase 2 is typically too slow to handle this amount of toxins and we start to store these in our fat cells causing us to be sick and inflamed. We also get rid of our extra estrogen through the liver so when Phase 2 slows, women experience PMS, constipation, and bloating during their menstrual cycle time. Men start to experience low energy, loss of libido and loss of muscle mass as high estrogen levels lead to low testosterone levels. If weight loss is part of your plan for detoxification this spring, you need to prepare your body for this by going through a proper program that provides the nutrients needed to down-regulate Phase 1, up-regulate Phase 2, and safely bring those toxins in a water-soluble form to the kidney. With our medical food detox program, you will be provided with all the necessary nutrients to safely help the liver get rid of toxins and help you lose weight. It also provides the necessary nutrients to get rid of heavy metals. It is important that a detox is done correctly and safely, so we rely on products that are proven to be the best and safest for our patients. These are good places to start and remember if God made it - eat it, if he didn't - leave it alone. To watch more about this topic click [here](https://youtu.be/fN7KOv2lYCs).
