What are the symptoms of autism? A. Symptoms of autism, which typically appear during the first few years of life, include difficulties with behavior, social skills and communication. Specifically, children with autism may have difficulty interacting socially with parents, siblings and other people; have difficulty with transitions and need routine; engage in repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping or rocking; display a preoccupation with activities or toys; and suffer a heightened sensitivity to noise and sounds. Autism spectrum disorders vary in the type and severity of the symptoms they cause, so two children with autism may not be affected in quite the same way. Q. What causes autism? A. The specific cause or causes of autism in all children are not known. But one thing is clear: Autism spectrum disorders are highly genetic. Researchers figured this out by studying twins. They found that when one identical twin had autism, the chance that the second twin had autism was greater than 90 percent. But when one fraternal twin had autism, the chance that the second twin had autism was less than 10 percent. Because identical twins have identical genes and fraternal twins don't, these studies proved the genetic basis of autism. Researchers have successfully identified some of the specific genes that cause autism. Some parents wonder whether environmental factors \u2014 defined as anything other than genetic factors \u2014 can cause autism. It's possible. For example, researchers found that thalidomide, a sedative, can cause autism if used during early pregnancy. Also, if pregnant women are infected with the rubella virus (German measles) during early pregnancy, their babies are more likely to have autism.Some parents are concerned that vaccines can cause autism. Their concerns center on three areas: the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine; thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative previously contained in several vaccines; and the notion that babies receive too many vaccines too soon. Q. Does the MMR vaccine cause autism? A. No. In 1998, a British researcher named Andrew Wakefield raised the notion that the MMR vaccine might cause autism. In the medical journal The Lancet, he reported the stories of eight children who developed autism and intestinal problems soon after receiving the MMR vaccine. To determine whether Wakefield's suspicion was correct, researchers performed a series of studies comparing hundreds of thousands of children who had received the MMR vaccine with hundreds of thousands who had never received the vaccine. They found that the risk of autism was the same in both groups. The MMR vaccine didn't cause autism. Some parents wary of the safety of the MMR vaccine stopped getting their children immunized. As immunization rates dropped, particularly in the United Kingdom and, to some extent, the United States, outbreaks of measles and mumps led to hospitalizations and deaths that could have been prevented. Q. Does thimerosal cause autism? A. No. Multiple studies have shown that thimerosal in vaccines does not cause autism. Thimerosal is a mercury- containing preservative that was used in vaccines to prevent contamination. In 1999, professional groups called for thimerosal to be removed from vaccines as a precaution. Unfortunately, the precipitous removal of thimerosal from all but some multi-dose preparations of influenza vaccine scared some parents. Clinicians were also confused by the recommendation. Since the removal of thimerosal, several studies have been performed to determine whether thimerosal causes autism. Hundreds of thousands of children who received thimerosal- containing vaccines were compared to hundreds of thousands of children who received the same vaccines free of thimerosal. The results were clear: The risk of autism was the same in both groups; thimerosal in vaccines did not cause autism. continued > Q&AVACCINES AND AUTISM: WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOWVolume 3 Winter 2019 Learn more: vaccine.chop.eduQ. Is autism caused by children receiving too many vaccines too soon? A. Several facts make it very unlikely that babies are overwhelmed by too many vaccines given too early in life. First, before they are licensed, new vaccines are always tested alone and in combination with existing vaccines. These studies determine whether new vaccines alter the safety and efficacy of existing vaccines and, conversely, whether existing vaccines affect the new vaccine. These studies, called concomitant use studies, are performed every time a new vaccine is added to the existing vaccination schedule. Second, although the number of vaccines has increased dramatically during the past century, the number of immunological components in vaccines has actually decreased. One hundred years ago, children received just one vaccine, for smallpox. The smallpox vaccine contained about 200 immunological components. Today, with advances in protein purification and recombinant DNA technology, the 14 vaccines given to young children contain only about 150 immunological components. Third, the immunological challenge from vaccines is minuscule compared to what babies typically encounter every day. The womb is sterile, containing no bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi. But when babies leave the womb and enter the world, they are immediately colonized by trillions of bacteria that live on the linings of their nose, throat, skin and intestines. Each bacterium contains between 2,000 and 6,000 immunological components. And babies often make an immune response to these bacteria to prevent them from entering the bloodstream and causing harm. The challenge that vaccines present is tiny in comparison to that from the environment. Fourth, children have an enormous capacity to respond to immunological challenges. Susumu Tonegawa, a molecular biologist who won a Nobel Prize for his work, showed that people have the capacity to make between 1 billion and 100 billion different types of antibodies. Given the number of immunological components contained in modern vaccines, a conservative estimate would be that babies have the capacity to respond to about 10,000 different vaccines at once. Although this sounds like a huge number, when you consider the number of challenges that babies face from bacteria in their environment, it's not. Here's another way to understand the difference in scale between immunological challenges from vaccines and natural challenges from the environment. The quantity of bacteria that live on body surfaces is measured in grams (a gram is the weight of about one-fifth of a teaspoon of water). The quantity of immunological components contained in vaccines is measured in micrograms or nanograms (millionths or billionths of a gram). Q. Are the studies showing that neither the MMR vaccine nor thimerosal causes autism sensitive enough to detect the problem in small numbers of children? A. The studies showing that neither the MMR vaccine nor thimerosal causes autism, called epidemiological studies, are very sensitive. For example, epidemiological studies have shown that a rotavirus vaccine used between 1998 and 1999 in the United States caused intestinal blockage in one out of every 10,000 vaccine recipients; that measles vaccine caused a reduction in the number of cells needed to stop bleeding (platelets) in one out of every 25,000 recipients; and that an influenza (swine flu) vaccine used in the United States in 1976 caused a type of paralysis called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in one out of every 100,000 recipients. About one out of every 59 children in the United States is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Even if vaccines caused autism in only 1 percent of autistic children, the problem would have easily been detected by epidemiological studies. Q. If I am concerned that vaccines cause autism, what is the harm in delaying or withholding vaccines for my baby? A. A study by Michael Smith and Charles Woods found that children who were fully vaccinated in the first year of life were not more likely to develop autism than those whose parents had chosen to delay vaccines. Further, all of the evidence shows that vaccines don't cause autism, so delaying or withholding vaccines will not lessen the risk of autism; it will only increase the period of time during which children are at risk for vaccine- preventable diseases. Several of these diseases, like chickenpox, pertussis (whooping cough) and pneumococcus (which causes bloodstream infections, pneumonia and meningitis) are still fairly common. Delaying or withholding vaccines only increases the time during which children are at unnecessary risk for severe and occasionally fatal infections.Q&AVACCINES AND AUTISM: WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOWREFERENCES AUTISM REFERENCES Alarcon M, Abrahams BS, Stone JL, et. al.
