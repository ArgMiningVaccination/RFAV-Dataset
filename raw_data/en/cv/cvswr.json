There are numerous vaccines that are addressed in the adult immunization schedule ( [Table 1](#html-table-103)).[ [1](#reference-6636)] Immunizing persons with HIV poses several challenges and concerns related to safety and efficacy. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides annual recommendations for routine immunizations of adults, including HIV-specific recommendations ( [Table 2](#html-table-105)).[ [1](#reference-6636)] In addition, the Adult and Adolescent OI Guidelines provides recommendations for Immunizations for Preventable Diseases in Adults and Adolescents Living with HIV. This topic review will focus on immunization recommendations for adults with HIV.[ [1](#reference-6636), [2](#reference-7228), [3](#reference-5045)] The individual immunizations topics discussed in this review are ordered alphabetically based on the vaccine. Risk of Live Vaccines in Persons with HIV Immunizations are generally safe in individuals with HIV, except for live virus vaccines in persons with low CD4 counts. In those individuals with HIV who have advanced immunosuppression, live vaccines can cause a potentially life-threatening disseminated infection with the live pathogen in the vaccine.[ [4](#reference-6402)] Challenges with Efficacy Current or past advanced immunosuppression in persons with HIV is often associated with suboptimal responses to standard recommended vaccine doses; for several vaccines, the response appears to depend on current and nadir CD4 cell counts.[ [5](#reference-49), [6](#reference-46), [7](#reference-50), [8](#reference-47)] In general, responses to immunization are better when the vaccine is given in persons with higher CD4 cell counts, including after immune reconstitution that has resulted from antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, in most circumstances, vaccine administration is not delayed until the CD4 count increases to greater "}
