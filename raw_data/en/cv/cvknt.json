A farmer, wearing just a loincloth, a drenched gray turban, and a molasses-hued tan, emerges from the top of the slope and lopes down a row of waist-high plants. His angular face is hard to read, but I can see he's gripping a tall walking stick. I'm a foreigner, a stranger, a trespasser, and for a moment I consider leaving. But I've just traveled 8,300 miles in 18 hours to stand amid the green shoots that rise as benignly as bunny ears. I smile and extend a hand. The farmer grasps it but remains wary until my interpreter finishes explaining why I'm here. \"Turmeric,\" says the man, suddenly breaking into a broad grin and sweeping his hand across the field. \"Yes, turmeric.\" His name is Kuriakose. This stalk-thin 62-year-old, who has spent his life farming rural tracts like this, knows nothing of science or of the mounting evidence that his crop may be an ancient antidote to the plague of prostate cancer. Why should he? Being hit by one of the buses that traverse the mountain passes here, succumbing to fever from the mosquitoes that bounce and flit around our heads\u2014those are concerns. He likewise doesn't know that the active compound in turmeric\u2014curcumin\u2014may also relieve or prevent a dozen other chronic maladies, including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. He frankly wouldn't know an antioxidant from an oxcart. What he does know is that his mother kept a bowl of \"Indian gold\" on the shelf and peppered nearly every dish with a pinch of it; that turmeric's luminous, knuckled root is what colors his fish and lamb curries yellow; that his grandmother made him gargle a turmeric concoction for colds and sprinkled the powder on skin cuts. What he knows is all he needs to: \"Turmeric is in me,\" he says. \"It's a part of me.\" In the Western world, researchers have long suspected Curcuma longa to be more than just a sunburst-yellow spice that doubles as a home remedy. But only in recent years have they become sufficiently intrigued to look beyond folklore and subject turmeric to the rigors of 21st-century science. In the 1990s, researchers from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston, investigated curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties to see if the compound could stop a tumor in its tracks. \"We grabbed a pinch of turmeric from the kitchen and tossed it on some cancer cells,\" says Bharat Aggarwal, Ph.D. \"The effect was staggering.\" It blocked a biological pathway needed for the development of melanoma and other cancers\u2014including prostate tumors. So impressed was Aggarwal that he coined the nickname \"cure-cumin.\" In 2007, Chinese scientists reported that curcumin could also play a key role in prostate-cancer treatment by dampening hormones implicated in the startup of the disease. That same year, University of Alabama researchers discovered that combining curcumin with traditional radiation therapy destroyed prostate-cancer cells that had previously become radiation resistant. And in yet another study, researchers at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit found that curcumin could weaken malignant prostate cells in a way that turned otherwise ineffective immunotherapeutic agents into potent tumor killers. Whatever the prostate-cancer conundrum was, the scrappy substance seemed to be up to the challenge, essentially acting as a biochemical body slam against the illness. Suddenly scientists were wondering if a cure for one of the world's worst man killers had existed under their noses for thousands of years. Could something so simple and plentiful defeat a disease that had thwarted the best minds in medicine for so long? Epidemiologists further amped up the excitement with studies showing that India, the country that produces and consumes most of the world's turmeric, also has one of the world's lowest prostate-cancer rates\u2014lower even than those of famously cancer-scarce Japan. In fact, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a mere five out of 100,000 Indian men develop the disease annually, versus 125 out of 100,000 men in the United States. Granted, genetics might explain some of this seeming invulnerability. But Subhash Gautam, Ph.D., an immunologist with Henry Ford Health System, believes India's high turmeric consumption and low prostate-cancer rate is no coincidence: \"It's highly plausible that eating three meals a day, each with a spoonful of turmeric\u2014as Indian men have done for thousands of years\u2014could be chemo preventive.\" Finally, there was the discovery that turmeric could be safely tolerated in doses so high that it was deemed virtually overdose-proof. \"It's mind-boggling,\" says Aggarwal. \"Turmeric is safe, and as far as the number of diseases it addresses, you name it. It truly has the potential of being a wonder spice.\" And yet despite such effusive praise, some skepticism is in order. For instance, if turmeric is indeed so wonderful, so miraculous, and so safe, why haven't we heard more about it? Why aren't we seeing commercials with beautiful people romping in slow motion through meadows of turmeric? And why aren't doctors sending us for Indian takeout, having us order the coconut lamb curry? In short, is turmeric really a wonder spice\u2014one that, to riff off Kuriakose, should be \"part of us\"?\u2014or is it just another herbal fad, a modern snake oil filled with the venom of false hope? I left my stomach somewhere between Kumarakom and Kolenchery, probably next to one of the cows parked on the sides of the moon-cratered, scooter-littered, rickshaw- rutted roads. Fortunately, the rest of me seems to have arrived intact at Synthite Corporation, India's largest producer of ingredients for the flavor and fragrance industry. I'm here to see how the turmeric plants grown by Kuriakose are pummeled into the yellow powder that brightens the mustard that makes my Wrigley Field hot dog so happy. The campus is a collection of low, dun-colored buildings that lie half hidden in a forest of coconut and neem trees. They bring to mind a Lost set, complete with a Dharma Initiative-type logo. Workers in white coats and hard hats roam on foot or in golf carts, vanishing down hilly paths into hangars where cauldrons are crowned by pipes that rear up like giant, stainless-steel idols. Transport trucks loaded with bales of leafy cargo roar past guards. Over all of this hangs the dense, pungent aroma of spices\u2014pepper, chili, and, of course, turmeric. My eyes water. \"Potent, eh?\" says my tour guide, a short, pudgy, baby-faced company official named\u2014comically, improbably, and aptly\u2014KC Baby. Potent, indeed. I bark out several dry coughs and a loud kaflooey of a sneeze as he leads me into a sweltering hangar where turmeric is being processed. Wide-eyed, I wander past the Willy Wonka-type contraptions and steam-tooting pipes as Baby describes the extraction process. After the heaps of raw turmeric plants from local farms arrive in trucks, the roots of the plants are ground and then treated with an organic solvent. As the turmeric solution courses through the complex web of pipes and cauldrons, the solvent evaporates, leaving behind a purified extract. Baby shows me the end result in a building where lab-coated researchers peer into microscopes, scribble on charts, and juggle beakers filled with fluorescent blue, green, and yellow liquids. In one room, Baby pulls down a vial of jasmine extract and puts a drop on a slide. He urges me to take a whiff. The aroma from that single drop is transporting. Baby grins and points out other vials: turmeric, cardamom, coriander, fennel seed, and nutmeg. Back out into the swelter, he leads me across campus to the mercifully air-conditioned company headquarters. Synthite is one of a growing number of companies that are sniffing an enormous market for turmeric. Until recently, the firm had given little thought to turmeric's value beyond its role as a condiment ingredient. \"But when we went to international conventions, everybody was asking for curcumin,\" Synthite's director, Viju Jacobs, tells me over iced herbal tea. \"So I started investigating.\" Sensing the possibility of a lucrative spin-off, he launched NatXtra, a line of curcumin supplements. Its success, he says, has helped Synthite's turmeric production rise from 57 tons in 2003 to 130 tons in 2006. This year, the company expects to bring as much as 180 tons to market. Curcumin as a health supplement is taking off, says Jacob. \"And hopefully will take off even more.\" A safe bet, so it would seem. Already, the Internet hums with 300-plus sites hawking some form of curcumin, turmeric-curcumin.com. Andrew Weil, M.D., the integrative-medicine guru, has partnered with Japan's largest tea maker, Ito En, to help boost U.S. consumption of turmeric. And McCormick, the world's biggest spice seller, has also taken notice. Last year, the company founded a scientific institute to sponsor univer- sity research into the health benefits of herbs and spices\u2014with turmeric heading the list. \"We just recognized a great potential in this area,\" says nutritionist Guy Johnson, Ph.D., who heads the McCormick Science Institute. \"We think turmeric has incredible potential implications for public health.\" Like Aggarwal, Johnson says he finds the host of possible health benefits \"absolutely breathtaking.\" Before I leave Synthite, I'm treated to a taste of the product at a curry lunch Jacob has arranged with some staff members. I haven't eaten all day, and the warm, delicious smell of spices has been torturing me since I arrived. I dig into the chicken curry like Augustus Gloop on a chocolate bar, and, no surprise, it's ambrosial. Not everyone is so giddy. For starters, some researchers have pointed out that early returns on curcumin, although intriguing\u2014thrilling even\u2014are still only suggestive. Human trials are in their earliest stages. Almost all of the findings, in fact, come from phase 1 trials. These pilot studies of small groups of people are aimed at determining the safety of a substance and establishing early evidence of its effectiveness. \"Currently, turmeric is a wonder spice for mice,\" says Gregory Cole, Ph.D., a UCLA researcher investigating its effect on Alzheimer's disease. \"What remains to be shown is compelling evidence that it really works in phase 2 clinical trials. If it doesn't work in people, it becomes an 'I wonder why' spice.\" Victoria Drake, Ph.D., a research associate with the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University, agrees. \"There simply isn't any conclusive evidence yet, at least not in humans,\" she says. \"Obviously, clinical trials would be needed.\" Why the caution? Consider other supplements that were once hailed as natural wonders. Ginkgo biloba, for example, soared to the top of the list of popular supplements on claims that it improved memory. However, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found no measurable benefit. St. John's wort, once thought to be a natural treatment for depression, was shown to be no more effective than a sugar pill in a 2002 Vanderbilt University study. And echinacea, the herbal cure for the common cold, had \"no significant effect\" on the incidence or severity of the sniffles, according to a 2005 study in the New England Journal of Medicine. In short, says American Medical Association president Ron Davis, M.D., \"there's more evidence that calls the efficacy of these supplements into question than persuasive evidence that shows they're effective.\" Nagging questions about safety also remain. \"There seems to be a presumption that because something is natural, it's safe,\" says Drake. \"That isn't always the case.\" Take ma huang, the traditional Chinese remedy better known as ephedra. Or rather, don't. The substance, extracted from the plant Ephedra sinica, was banned by the FDA in 2004 after being linked to several heart attacks and strokes. Though turmeric has so far shown no signs of toxicity, the bigger problem may be its poor bioavailability\u2014that is, how well the curcumin is absorbed through a person's stomach lining and into the bloodstream. \"It can't do much of anything really bad or really good if you don't absorb it,\" says Cole. Researchers have sought to solve this riddle by combining curcumin with a black-pepper extract called piperine. And indeed, back in India, scientists at Bangalore's St. John's Medical College found that adding piperine to curcumin increased its bioavailability in humans by 2,000 percent. For fans of Indian cuisine, that's even more good news\u2014black pepper, as it turns out, is nearly as ubiquitous as turmeric in native dishes. In some treatment scenarios, bioavailability may not even be an issue. When researchers at the Henry Ford Health System studied the pairing of curcumin and chemotherapy, they found that only minuscule amounts of the compound were needed to weaken prostate-cancer cells. When it comes down to it, even Cole can't argue with the results of his own research: Out of 10 approaches tested, curcumin was proved most effective at lowering the amount of amyloid toxins believed to cause Alzheimer's disease. \"You have plenty of promise for a potent drug,\" he says, \"but also a great need to learn how to make it useful for prevention and for patients.\" The stakes are huge, the hurdles formidable. Unfettered by the need for FDA approval, supplement makers can promise miracles. But the only way Western doctors will bite is if turmeric passes muster with the feds. If that happens, curry yellow won't be the only gold associated with the spice. What is the potential market for an effective prostate-cancer drug?\" asks Dennis Schafer, president and CEO of the upstart North Carolina biotech firm Curry Pharmaceuticals. \"It's very large because of the high prevalence of the cancer and the need to minimize the side effects of therapy.\" Turmeric would seem a natural candidate to be such a blockbuster. So why are the major drug companies sitting back while the herbal-supplement industry hogs the market? The reason comes down to money, as it so often does. The kind of expensive clinical work needed to satisfy the FDA is work that is normally done by a drug company willing to risk hundreds of millions of dollars, says Cole. The reward is a patent that grants that company the exclusive rights to sell the drug for 20 years. In the case of turmeric, two doctors from the University of Mississippi medical center applied for\u2014and won\u2014a 1997 U.S. patent to market the spice as a wound healer. But when India's Council of Scientific & Industrial Research found out, it was outraged, charging biopiracy and claiming that it was impossible to discover healing properties that had been known in India for thousands of years. The U.S. Patent Office agreed with the argument and reversed its ruling, effectively killing any chance that turmeric would jump from the spice rack to the medicine cabinet. Companies could still sell turmeric and curcumin, but they couldn't patent either one.The decision, however, left a legal loophole. What if a company\u2014say, a small biotech firm\u2014were to create a synthetic version of turmeric, a substance it could claim was even more potent than the spice itself? And what if instead of turmeric or curcumin, it gave this clone a brand name that it made up? Enter Curry Pharmaceuticals and a San Diego firm, AndroScience. Those companies and others are indeed vying to develop their own curcumin-like blockbuster, with the potential for billions of dollars in sales to the winner. Currently, AndroScience is gearing up to offer a synthetic compound based on curcumin that it believes can outperform Propecia and Rogaine in treating male-pattern baldness. This makes sense (at least in theory) given that the development of both baldness and prostate cancer are, to varying degrees, connected to elevated levels of the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT). \"The compound works by reducing the androgen receptors, which DHT binds to, resulting in hair loss,\" says CEO Charles Shih, M.D. \"I don't think I have to tell you how many patients are out there waiting for an effective drug like this.\" At the same time, Curry Pharmaceuticals is in the process of trying to create a curcumin twin that can treat prostate and other cancers. If and when these smaller companies hit on an effective drug, they'll offer it to Big Pharma\u2014GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, or some other giant. That's when you'll begin to see curcumin commercials. \"The way the biotech industry works is that we're kind of like a minor-league baseball team feeding the major-league pharmaceutical industry,\" says Curry Pharmaceuticals' Schafer. \"We're doing most of the research, but it takes marketing muscle to move a new product. So it usually makes sense for us to partner with them.\" Put another way, says Aggarwal, \"Big Pharma lets the little guys battle it out, then comes in with a checkbook. They don't want to be bothered at this stage.\" American men face a decision: Take a supplement or wait? Pop a capsule a day, knowing you're spending $10 on a bottle of potential? Or wait for an FDA-approved drug and risk missing out on the answer to prostate cancer? Or you could choose door number 3: Eat more Indian food and slather on the mustard the same way you might regularly dine on fatty fish or drink red wine to protect your heart. There's little chance of harm, researchers say, and the potential for considerable good. For men who already have prostate cancer and are considering turmeric as a treatment rather than a preventive, perhaps the most sensible position comes from an unlikely source. As you would expect, Schafer is a big critic of the supplement industry and what he calls its willingness to make unsupported health claims. And yet he has a confession to make about curcumin supplements. \"If I had prostate cancer, I would take some,\" says Schafer. \"Curcumin has a very strong scientific record of safety. I just would never know if it worked, and my oncologist wouldn't know either. That said, there's enough evidence that it might help.\" In India, there is no hand-wringing. Here, turmeric is simply a part of everyday existence. I find it everywhere, from the round dot on women's foreheads (called bindi and often made from kumkum, a turmeric-based mixture), to the shelves and spice bowls in the shops of Mattancheri and Thekkady, to the two women I see trudging up a mountain road balancing huge bushels of the spice on their heads. The face of a small idol outside my hotel is smeared with the spice. The rich, brilliant color explodes in fabrics and paints pigmented with turmeric-based dyes. Vast acres of turmeric carpet the spice plantations of Tamil Nadu. I've begun to grasp firsthand what Kuriakose meant when he said turmeric \"is a part of me.\" A similar feeling of pride and reverence is expressed to me many times as my stay in India winds down. When I visit Kannan Balachandran, 34, who owns a small spice shop in Kochi, Kerala, he produces a large bowl of turmeric, over which he muses, \"I have seen my granny, when the children get a cut, put it in the wound. When a chicken became ill, I saw her mix it with rice and feed it.\" Shagzil Khan, 29, a tour guide, listens and nods. \"It is just something we know,\" he says. \"No one teaches you this. There's never any asking, 'Why is it so?' \" I ask both men whether they ever worry about prostate cancer, whether it's touched their lives in the ways it has touched my own (my uncle suffers from the disease, and I have reached the age of routine PSA tests). They stare at me for a moment and look at each other, and then Khan wobbles his head\u2014a gesture akin to a shrug here. \"I haven't thought about it at all.\" Back at the small turmeric farm, the sun is gone. The air, hot and boggy before, has been rinsed clean and is now fragrant with spice. Before I leave the field and India for good (with a few sealed plastic bags of turmeric stashed in my carry-on), I take a last look at the bunny-eared plants. The sky is low and mustard colored. Kuriakose has finished for the day. The turmeric, he tells me through my interpreter, is in its early growth cycle. Its roots\u2014the fingerlike rhizomes that will be pulverized into gold powder\u2014won't be ready for harvest for at least another 7 months. His job, for now, is to watch and wait, to tend his crop and see what it will yield. "}
