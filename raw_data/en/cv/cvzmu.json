Infection with malaria is responsible for an estimated 5,300-21,000 lost work hours and $1.12-4.37 million per year in evacuation and medical care costs despite existing personal protective countermeasures like chemoprophylactic drugs, permethrin-impregnated uniforms, bed nets and unit preventive countermeasures like vector/environmental control (DEET) and education. These infections are largely driven by poor adherence to personal protective measures, chemoprophylaxis and rising regional drug resistance. A safe, durable and efficacious malaria preventive will eliminate the burden of compliance and the associated side effects of daily or weekly chemoprophylaxis, overcome regional drug resistance to currently available antimalarials and provide an alternative to individuals with G6PD deficiency. Protection against malaria infection improves unit readiness and mission success. MBB is an integrated, broad, translational enterprise spanning discovery science to field efficacy trials. Building off our historical experience developing malaria vaccines, our mission is to develop new vaccines and biologics in collaboration with global and U.S. government partners to reliably prevent malaria infection in military personnel by maintaining robust, expert competency in basic and applied research areas in order to transition candidate products to advanced clinical testing in endemic areas "}
