Toxins can and often do become trapped in the body's organs and tissues, which over time can negatively impact health, vitality, and overall wellness, and may contribute to the development of chronic illness. There is no practical way to protect you from all the toxins in the environment. Fortunately, there are ways to counteract some toxins and pollutants. Your body's natural detoxification processes exist to deal with the ones we can't avoid. You can help your body perform these processes with the help of regular cleansing. The art of detox is so important in assisting the body's natural elimination processes.
