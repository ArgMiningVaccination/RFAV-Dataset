Advanced TCM Spiritual Healing is a branch of TCM that has been lost over the years. This aspect of TCM focuses solely on the spiritual, and the healing of a person's soul. This differs from TCM as you know it, an alternative medicine practice that includes acupuncture, herbal medicine, moxibustion, cupping and more. Advanced TCM Spiritual Healers do not hold qualifications in Traditional Chinese Medicine and do not prescribe remedies or physical therapies. An Advanced TCM Spiritual Healer works solely with chi energy to heal the soul. For this reason, we often simply refer to ourselves as chi healers. Advanced TCM Spiritual Healers operate under the Eastern medicine philosophy, which is to investigate and find the cause of ailments, injuries and disease by connecting with your soul. Our Western counterparts, in the main, treat the symptom of a health issue, which can deliver instant relief but may not be a long term solution. Both methods of practice can and do work well together...my naturopathy partner & I cross pollinate well! Reiki practitioners channel Universal energy down through the body and out the palms for healing, calming and harmonising the client on the receiving end. The degree of healing is dependant on the power and frequency of the practitioner's channel. TCM Spiritual Healing, in contrast takes the client's soul directly up to Source where the degree of healing is exponentially higher. Additionally, chi healing addresses the root cause of illness identified as emotional traumas, spiritual entities and 'dozy' chromosomes. This means that in addition to a calming, harmonising energy, the client receives a clearing that has long lasting effects on wellbeing. There are only a small handful of practitioners trained in this modality, from one of the most advanced Chi Masters in the World. There is NO religious aspect. The term Spiritual is used to identify the connection to our souls. The soul being the very essence of our being (our life force) and the intrinsic relationship to building good physical health. This really depends on how well the individual's physical self is connected to the soul. On average, the transference can take between 2-3 days dependent on what healing has taken place. It can be quicker; it can be longer. I offer a 15 minute initial consult via zoom or telephone, free of charge to assess whether this modality is right for you. All healing sessions are $200. Details of each treatment session are approved by the client beforehand. This depends on the individual and the complexity of their healing requirements. "}
