Others may not feel comfortable using the word until after their treatment ends. Others may prefer to use a different word. Your loved ones may not use the word \"survivor\" (or another word) in the same way as you do. If that's the case, feel free to ask them to use the language you prefer. The different feelings people have about using the term \"survivor\" are all valid. Welcome Being diagnosed with cancer is like being sent on a journey that you did not want to take. You are forced to go to places you did not want to go to, learn a language you never planned on learning, and do things you never wanted to do. You will have questions and \"In cancer, survivorship focuses on the health and well-being of a person with cancer from the time of diagnosis until the end of life. This includes the physical, mental, emotional, social, and financial effects of cancer that begin at diagnosis and continue through treatment and beyond. The survivorship experience also includes issues related to follow-up care (including regular health and wellness checkups), late effects of treatment, cancer recurrence, second cancers, and quality of life. Family members, friends, and caregivers are also considered part of the survivorship experience.\" - The National Cancer Institute (NCI), www.cancer.govSURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 3concerns along the way. Navigating this foreign landscape and coping with the unpredictable demands of day-to-day life that come with the territory can be overwhelming. Remember you are not alone. The support of loved ones and organizations, such as The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), can help you to navigate new pathways and help you find your \"new normal.\" How to Use this Workbook Use this workbook to collect all the important information you need as you move through diagnosis and treatment into long-term management of a chronic blood cancer or finish treatment and begin post-treatment survivorship care. Make it personal. Part of the information you will need for long-term management of a blood cancer or survivorship will come from resources such as The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) and your healthcare team. A good deal of important information will also come from the time you take to reflect on your personal experience as a cancer survivor. Take this workbook with you to appointments. Fill out the worksheets with help from members of your healthcare team, as needed. When you meet with new healthcare providers, share the information. For patients with a blood cancer diagnosis, there may never be a clear-cut time when treatment ends, but the information, worksheets and questions in this workbook still apply.

Ask members of your healthcare team for a written survivorship care plan. You can use the information provided in the plan to fill out this section of the workbook and/or save a copy in the pocket of this section. Record your diagnosis and all of your treatment information on the following pages. Knowing your exact diagnosis and treatment, including specific drugs and/or site of radiation, is very important information.

Your healthcare team will order frequent blood tests to monitor your blood cell counts, both during and after treatment. Blood cancers and treatment for blood cancers can affect blood cell counts in a number of different ways. Anemia (a low number of red blood cells) o Red blood cells contain hemoglobin which carries oxygen around the body. Anemia can make you look pale, feel weak and tired, and become short of breath. Thrombocytopenia (a low number of platelets) o Platelets help form blood clots to stop or slow bleeding. Thrombocytopenia can cause excessive bleeding and bruising. Neutropenia (a low number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell) o White blood cells help the body fight infection. A low number of neutrophils increases the risk of infection. Keep track of your lab reports so that you can share them with your providers. You can keep printed copies in the pocket of this section. You may also be able to access your lab reports online through a patient portal provided by your hospital or treatment center. Ask your healthcare team how to access your reports.

However, some treatments may cause significant long-term and/or late effects. Follow-up medical care to monitor survivors for possible long-term and/or late effects is important. You should discuss the possible effects of treatment with your healthcare providers in order to plan treatment and follow-up care. The factors that determine the risk of long-term and/or late effects include: Type of treatment o For example, the specific drugs used or the part of the body treated with radiation Length of treatment Your age at the time of treatment Your sex Overall health \"Long-term effects\" of cancer therapy are medical problems that last for months or years after treatment ends. Fertility (the ability to become pregnant or father a child) problems and treatment-related fatigue are examples of long-term effects. \"Late effects\" are medical problems that do not show up until years after treatment ends. Treatment-related cancer and heart disease are examples of late effects.Keep a record of any cognitive, physical or emotional signs or symptoms that you experience and discuss them with your healthcare team. You can keep notes in a journal or notebook. You can also download the free LLS Health ManagerTM mobile app to track side effects, medication, food and hydration, questions for your doctor, and more. Visit www.LLS.org/HealthManager to download.24 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgLong-term and late effects for survivors of blood cancers may include: Cognitive effects (effects on thinking, learning and memory) Physical effects Psychological effects Cognitive Effects Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation to the brain, can cause changes with thinking, such as difficulty with concentration, memory and the ability to multi-task. These effects are sometimes referred to as \"chemo brain\" or \"brain fog.\" Many cancer patients experience cognitive effects to some degree. For most people, cognitive effects last only a short time and improve after treatment ends. Other people, however, may have long-term cognitive changes. Physical Effects Depending on the type and duration of treatment, age and overall health, cancer patients may be at risk for: Fatigue Neuropathy (nerve damage) Heart disease Thyroid problems Organ damage (lungs, kidneys) Bone issues, such as osteoporosis Fertility problems (See Family Planning and Fertility on page 61.)

Anxiety disorder o Anxiety disorder is different from the feelings of anxiety that are caused by the common worries encountered in day-to-day life. Symptoms of anxiety disorder can include intrusive thoughts and make it difficult to pull yourself away from a persistent anxious state of mind. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) o Post-traumatic stress disorder can develop in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary or dangerous event (such as being diagnosed with cancer). Symptoms can include anxiety, nightmares and/or frightening thoughts. Your mental health is very important to your overall health and well-being.

Complementary therapies are treatments used along with standard treatments but are not considered standard medical care. Integrative medicine combines standard medicine (such as chemotherapy) with safe and effective complementary therapies. Some examples of complementary therapies include acupuncture, meditation, therapeutic massage, and yoga. Consult with your healthcare team before you try any complementary therapy to make sure it will not interfere with your treatment or medications. Ask your healthcare team if your cancer center has a complementary therapies program. Medical Marijuana. Marijuana has been used in herbal remedies for centuries. The biologically active components in marijuana are called \"cannabinoids.\" The two best studied components are the chemicals delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Under federal law, marijuana cannot legally be prescribed, possessed, or sold. Under many state laws, the use of marijuana to treat some medical conditions is legal. Under some state laws, the use of recreational marijuana by adults is legal. (Even in these states, its use is still illegal for minors.) In cancer care, medical marijuana is sometimes used to manage side effects, such as nausea, appetite loss, pain or anxiety, if other medications or treatments are unsuccessful. More research is needed to better understand the benefits and risks of marijuana and its cannabinoids. Do not use marijuana or products made with cannabinoids without first talking to your healthcare team. Marijuana or related products (for example, CBD oils) could interfere with other medications. Marijuana products that are not obtained from licensed dispensaries carry additional risks as they may Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Integrative Medicine and Complementary Therapies Facts.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 31contain unknown ingredients, including infectious agents. Talk honestly with members of the healthcare team about your use of marijuana or related products. Educating Family Members and Friends About Long-Term and Late Effects Once you finish cancer treatment, enter a watch-and-wait protocol, or become more comfortable managing the effects of living with a chronic blood cancer, your family and friends may assume that you will immediately feel the way you did before your cancer diagnosis. You may need to explain that even though you may seem okay you are still recovering or adjusting physically and/or emotionally. I am still experiencing: Example: Fatigue _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ This affects me in the following ways: Example: Sometimes I do not have the energy to do all the things I need or want to do. _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________Use the spaces below to plan what you will say to explain these feelings to family members and friends.32 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgYou can help me by: Example: Picking up my grocery order for me and understanding when I may not feel up for family game night. _______________________________________________ _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ WORKBOOK l 33Healthy Behavior Recommendations Developing healthy lifestyle habits are important for cancer survivors. Healthy lifestyle habits can help you recover faster and decrease the risk of disease, such as other cancers, heart disease and diabetes. Making changes so that you can be healthier can also help you gain a sense of control throughout survivorship. Many things may be out of your control, but you can still take good care of yourself. I eat a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, proteins, whole grains and healthy fats. I drink at least eight 8-oz glasses of water or liquids (not including caffeinated drinks, such as coffee, or drinks with added sugars) each day. I sleep well each night and wake up feeling rested. o Most adults need at least 7 to 8 hours of rest each night. I exercise regularly. I do not smoke or use tobacco. I drink alcohol not at all or only in moderation. o Ask your doctor if it is safe for you to drink alcohol. Limit consumption to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. One drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of liquor. I protect myself from sun damage. o Avoid direct sun, when possible, and wear broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher and re-apply every 2 hours. Check all of the healthy behavior statements that are true for you.34 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. org I keep up with my medical needs, such as annual checkups with my primary care provider and getting regular dental cleanings. I keep my hematologist- oncologist informed about any changes in my well-being. I take all medications as prescribed. I talk to my healthcare team about my mental health. I practice self-care and do things to manage stress. o See C reating a Self-Care Plan on page 43. I connect with others (people I love, friends and/or members of a support group) regularly. o Isolation is a risk factor for depression and anxiety disorder. See Community Resources and Networking on page 71. Did you leave any of these statements unchecked? If so, you may need to consider working on those aspects of your lifestyle. Discuss healthy behaviors with your primary care provider. Ask for referrals to professionals for help with specific issues (for example, a registered dietitian, physical therapist or a mental health professional). What are some steps you would like to take to improve your overall health and well-being? Write your answer on the next page.

Everyone needs to be checked for diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease and other cancers. The specific screening recommendations for you will depend on your age, sex and medical history. Most diseases are easier to treat or manage if discovered early. Many disease screening tests can be part of your annual wellness exam. Your primary care provider can help coordinate any tests you will need. Diseases commonly screened for include: Some types of cancer, including colorectal, breast, cervical, prostate High blood pressure and high cholesterol levels (risk factors for heart disease) Diabetes Osteoporosis (weak bones) STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) Mental health conditions, such as depressionVisit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Healthy Behaviors and Nutrition Handbook for more information about healthy behaviors. 36 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgTalk to your primary care provider about the disease screenings you need and how often you need them. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most insurance plans to cover preventative services at no cost. Other Disease Screening Recommendations Disease Screening Recommendation Visit www.health.gov/myhealthfinder to use MyHealthfinder to get disease screening and vaccine recommendations based on your age and sex. The MyHealthfinder recommendations come from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Discuss these recommendations with your primary care provider.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 37Immunizations Immunizations help the body build resistance to a specific disease. Ask your primary care provider which immunizations you need. You likely received many immunizations as a child. However, other immunizations are given annually or need periodic boosters of vaccines to remain effective. You may also need new immunizations depending on your medical history. Some cancer treatments can deplete the protection that a previous immunization provided. OPENImmunization Record Vaccine Date(s) GivenComments/ Reactions Flu (influenza) Tdap or Td (tetanus, diphtheria, haemophilus influenzae type b) COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) * Vaccines noted with an asterisk are not recommended for patients who have a weakened immune system. If the patient received these vaccines before the cancer diagnosis, there is no harm done.People undergoing cancer treatment should receive the flu shot that is made with the dead virus. Patients must not get the nasal spray vaccine because it contains the live virus and can be dangerous for immunosuppressed patients. People who are receiving cancer treatment and require the shingles (zoster) vaccine should receive the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix), not the zoster vaccine live. If you plan to travel outside of the United States, check the recommended vaccines for that location. You may need additional immunizations. Always clear travel with your healthcare team.

Even years after diagnosis or treatment, some people continue to struggle with feelings of sadness, anxiety, grief or guilt. Some people experience \"survivor's guilt\" especially if a close friend or family member passed away from cancer. Others fear that their cancer may come back or get worse. Some feel a sense of loss or grief for their life before the cancer diagnosis. Having these feelings is normal; however, negative feelings shouldn't be interfering with your daily life. Talk to members of your healthcare team about your mental health concerns. You may benefit from the support of a medical health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, or, in some cases, medication to help with depression and anxiety. Fear of Relapse Many people who have been diagnosed with cancer fear their cancer either coming back or getting worse. For some, these fears surface or become worse around the anniversary of their diagnosis or transplant date. For others, these fears surface or become worse around checkups and screenings. Some cancer survivors call this \"scanxiety.\" These fears are normal, and there are things you can do to manage them. Check off the action items in the list on the following page that you think may help lessen your fear of relapse or disease progression. You do not need to do all of them. Find what works best for you.40 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. org Talk to your oncologist about your risk for relapse or disease progression and the signs and/or symptoms that may indicate a relapse or disease progression. o Knowing this information can help you better understand your situation and minimize the fear of the unknown. Talk to a mental health professional. o A mental health professional can help you to fine-tune your awareness of your emotions so that you feel more in control. They can also help you learn coping strategies to care for yourself. Ask your doctor for a referral or call your insurance provider. Make lifestyle changes to improve your overall health and well-being, such as making good food choices or starting an exercise program. See Healthy Behavior Recommendations on page 33. o Talk to your doctor before changing your diet or starting an exercise program. Find a hobby to occupy your mind. o Try knitting, cooking, playing video games, painting, hiking or any other activity that appeals to you. Journal. o Keeping a journal, or \"journaling,\" provides an outlet to express yourself. It can help you to identify (name) and cope with your emotions. o Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to order Write It Out , a journal for blood cancer patients with prompts, tips, coloring pages and many blank pages. Connect with other cancer survivors. o Cancer support groups and peer-to-peer programs are not just for patients receiving treatment. There are programs for people who are years out of treatment SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 41as well as for those living with a chronic diagnosis. Talking to others who understand what you've been through can be helpful. See Community Resources and Networking on page 71. Identifying and Coping with Emotional Triggers Learn what triggers your emotions and find ways to cope. Do movies or TV shows that address cancer upset you? Don't watch them. Does the sight of the sweatshirt you wore on treatment days bother you? Throw it out or donate it to a clothing bank. Do you get especially anxious around scan days? Ask a friend to video chat with you. Do you feel calmer after a good walk? Do you feel more energized after connecting with a group of friends? Is your perspective different after a good night's sleep? Identify the objects, activities, specific foods, or situations that trigger negative feelings, so you may feel more confident about your ability to care for yourself. What triggers your fear of relapse? Example: Anniversary date of diagnosis _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________To begin to understand what helps you feel less stressed, answer the questions below.42 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgAre there ways you can avoid these triggers?

How to Create a Self-Care Plan Self-care comes in many different forms. It's easy to say you want to take more time for yourself, but it can be hard to actually find the time. You will have to consciously make the time and set self-care goals. Complete the following activities to create a self-care plan:44 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgMental and Emotional Self-Care Taking care of your mental and emotional health is just as important as caring for your physical health. It's important to take time for yourself each day to do activities that you enjoy. Make a conscious effort to care for your own mental and emotional health. What activities do you enjoy? Check all that apply.

Examples: talk to friends, attend a religious or spiritual service, go to an art class Change the activity and frequency to accommodate your lifestyle and needs, but do make sure you are making time for yourself. Physical Self-Care Taking care of your physical well-being is also an important part of self-care. See Healthy Behavior Recommendations on page 33 for more information. Body Image and Self-Esteem Almost every person struggles with body image and self- esteem at some point, but cancer survivors may face unique challenges. Cancer treatment can cause changes to the body such as hair loss, weight loss or weight gain, and skin changes. Many cancer survivors struggle with these side effects. Other cancer survivors don't experience them, so people around them may assume that they aren't \"really sick.\" There is no one way a cancer survivor should look. It's normal to feel differently about your body after a cancer diagnosis, whether or not there are visible changes. However, try not to allow any negative feelings to get in the way of your happiness.46 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgWrite down some important things your body can do. Example: My arms can hug the people I love. My hands can cook a good meal. _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ Write down some things you like about yourself.

Wear clothes that are comfortable. Don't worry about the number on the tag. Wear the size that feels the best on your body. The following exercises can help you being to understand yourself in new ways.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 47 Avoid looking at images online and in magazines that make you feel badly about your body or appearance. Treat your body well by adopting healthy habits. See Healthy Behavior Recommendations on page 33. Move your body. Go for a walk, do chair exercises or some other form of gentle movement. Watch for negative self-talk (thinking or saying negative things about yourself). We are often our own harshest critics. Next time you have a negative thought about yourself, ask yourself, \"Would I say or think this sort of thing about someone I love?\" Talk to yourself in the same way you would talk to someone you love. If some of your family members or friends talk about appearance or body size around you, ask them not to. Almost everyone is self-conscious about their appearance and talking about it frequently only adds to those feelings. There are much more interesting things to talk about! Remember, you don't have to love everything about your body, but you do need to respect and care for it. Ask members of your healthcare team for a referral to a therapist or counselor who can help you work on your self-esteem. Look Good Feel Better is a program that teaches beauty techniques to people with cancer to help them manage the appearance-related side effects of cancer treatment. The program includes lessons on skin and nail care, cosmetics, wigs and turbans, accessories and styling. Visit www.lookgoodfeelbetter.org for more information. You can also ask your healthcare team about local programs for hats, wigs, or other services. Or, call an LLS Information Specialist at (800) 955-4572.48 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgManaging Depression It is normal to feel sad, depressed, or anxious even many years after a cancer diagnosis. However, if these feelings start interfering with your daily activities, talk to your doctor and seek counseling from a mental health professional. Symptoms of clinical depression include: Ongoing sadness or feelings of hopelessness Loss of interest or pleasure in most activities Major weight loss or weight gain Agitation or restlessness Fatigue or no energy Trouble sleeping Trouble focusing, remembering, or making decisions Feeling worthless, guilty, or helpless Thoughts of death or suicide Don't be afraid to seek help.

The Lifeline is free, confidential and always available.Even if you do not have symptoms of clinical depression or anxiety, you can still benefit from talking to a mental health professional. They will provide you with tools for identifying your emotions and help you to learn ways to cope with them.FPO Divider PageRelationships and Family Relationships and Family SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 49Relationships and Family During cancer treatment, there will likely be one or more people in your life who step into the role of caregiver. This person may be your significant other, an adult child, another relative or a close friend. Your caregiver may go with you to appointments or treatment, assist with daily chores and errands, help prepare food, offer emotional support, and other tasks as needed. Defining Your Caregiver's Role Do you wish to share all your medical information with your caregiver?

It is important to consider all the implications of sharing a cancer diagnosis on social media. Take time to think them over. Would it upset you if a potential employer, a date or a casual acquaintance learned about the diagnosis from an internet search?52 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgSupport for Your Caregiver After your cancer diagnosis, your loved ones may have had difficulty coping, especially the person(s) who became your primary caregiver(s).

Children and Grandchildren Talking to the children in your life about your cancer diagnosis can be intimidating. You may worry about what to say or what not to say. You may even wish to protect your children or grandchildren by not telling them about the cancer diagnosis; SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 53however, children are very perceptive. Even young children may be able to tell that something is wrong. Giving your children or grandchildren honest information from the start will lead to feelings of trust, control and involvement. Teenagers and young adults may even wish to help with caregiving duties. Allow them to help, as age appropriate. Your Significant Other People react to cancer differently. Your partner may be supportive and end up being your best caregiver. Your partner may have a difficult time coping. Either way, your relationship will probably change. If you hit a rough patch, it may be beneficial for you and your partner to attend couples counseling. Look to your healthcare team, support group, or place of worship for resources and recommendations. If your partner will be your primary caregiver, set expectations in advance. See Defining Your Caregiver's Role on page 49. Dating and New Relationships If you feel well enough during treatment, you never have to stop dating. Due to side effects of treatment, you may not feel up for it. You may want to take time for yourself to heal. It is your choice. Do not feel pressured to date if you are not interested or not feeling up to it. However, do not let cancer stop you if you feel like you are ready to meet new people. Telling a Date about your Diagnosis When and how you tell someone about your cancer diagnosis is your choice. Some people prefer to share their diagnosis Visit www.LLS.org/parenting to view Age-Appropriate Discussion Guidelines. 54 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgright away to clear the air and to see if the person will be supportive or not. Some people prefer to wait until they trust the person. Take some time to think about which is most comfortable for you. Sex and Intimacy Cancer treatment may affect your sexuality and the way you feel about your body. Potential sexual side effects of cancer treatment include: Erectile dysfunction Vaginal dryness Pain during intercourse Lack of desire Difficulty reaching climax Fertility problems (See Family Planning and Fertility on page 61.) You may be self-conscious about physical changes to your body such as hair loss, weight changes, swelling, scars or the presence of a central line or port. Fatigue, nausea, pain or other side effects may interfere with your desire for sex. Here are some of the most important things to keep in mind: Ask your doctor if it is safe for you to have sex. o Your doctor may even advise that you abstain from sex if your white blood cell or platelet counts are low. Speak to your healthcare team about sexual changes. There are treatments and therapies available to lessen sexual side effects. Ask for a referral to a sex therapist. Be open with your partner about any changes, especially if something hurts or is uncomfortable. Always use protection to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 55 o Pregnancy during cancer treatment is usually not safe for either the pregnant person or the child. If you suspect you are pregnant, talk to your healthcare team. o Use condoms or another barrier method, to protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Oral contraception (birth control pills) and implants (for example, an intrauterine device [IUD]) do not protect against STDs. The decision to have sex or be intimate with someone is completely your decision. It may not be safe, comfortable, or enjoyable for you to have sex during cancer treatment. If this is the case, rethink intimacy and find new ways for you and your partner to be intimate such as writing love notes, massages or light touching, or simply spending time alone together.

Many aspects of your life may have felt uncertain. Now that you've completed cancer treatment or become more comfortable with long-term management of a chronic illness, you may be ready to start thinking about the future again. You may also need to come to terms with a future that looks different now than the future you envisioned before you were diagnosed with cancer. It can be difficult to accept the impact of your cancer diagnosis on your future goals and aspirations. After your diagnosis, you may have not been able to pursue career goals. Relationships with loved ones, friends, and colleagues may have changed too. You are likely to encounter problems you hadn't anticipated. For example, you may be facing fertility issues that affect the plans you have for a family. (See Long-Term and Late Effects on page 23.) You may feel a sense of grief for your old life. This feeling is common among cancer survivors. Take the time you need to grieve, and then begin to look towards the future. You may still be able to accomplish many of the goals you had before your diagnosis or now you may have set new goals for yourself. Setting Priorities When you are planning for the future, take some time to consider your priorities. What are your goals for the future? Are there specific things you want to achieve or activities you would like to enjoy more? Think about what is most important to you and order your priorities accordingly. Dedicate more time to your top priorities and allocate less time to others\u2014 especially the ones that don't support your goals. Use the following exercise to help you think through your priorities. Setting priorities or goals helps you to focus your 58 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgtime and energy on the things that matter most. However, don't let setting priorities become an additional source of stress or anxiety. You can revisit your goals and priorities and change them at any time. In the list below, circle your top 10 priorities or goals for the future. Use the blank spaces to add things that are not included in the list, but that you place in your top ten.

Family Planning and Fertility \"Fertility\" describes the ability to conceive a biological child. Some cancers and some cancer treatments affect fertility in males and females. The risk of infertility caused by cancer and its treatment is based on several factors, including the 62 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgtype of cancer; the type, duration, and doses of treatment; and the patient's age at the start of treatment. Addressing fertility and sexual health is an essential part of cancer treatment and follow-up care.
