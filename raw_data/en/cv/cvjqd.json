The goal is to increase the cancer focused NIH funding base in the IUSCCC. Non-NCI targeted applications should have significant cancer relevance. Investigators wishing to apply to this funding mechanism must first submit a draft cover letter (letter of intent) for approval by the IUSCCC Executive Committee before working with a Coordinator to submit a full application. Once approved, the link for submitting the online application will be sent. Maximum allowable amount for R01, R42 and R44 grants is $50K with P01 and SPORE funding amounts evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Emphasis of CTSI postdoctoral training awards in translational research are to move findings from basic laboratory and pre-clinical research (referred to as T1 research) toward the development of new treatment options or interventions or clinical trials (referred to as T2 research) to eventual dissemination or clinical implementation (referred to as T3 research) to studying population health outcomes and health metrics (referred to as T4 research). The phases of translational research may not necessarily be linear and can jump steps depending on the research project and the starting point. The goal of the CTSI is to make awards at all of these stages. Funding for all postdoctoral training awards is for up to two years (with the 2nd year of funding contingent upon review and demonstration of satisfactory progress). Benefits include salary support as well as health insurance and research training related expenses. Applications will be accepted for two tracks: - Community- Public Health Track: Available for those postdoctoral fellows who have a keen interest for directed training in T3 to T4 translational research in the areas of clinical, health care delivery, public health, population health, or community or policy based efforts. It is important that the translational research have clear applications to human disease and health outcomes. - Traditional Track: Available for postdoctoral fellows who have an interest in undertaking a translational research project tailored to his or her interests while working in a research environment with mentors who can help the fellow develop the necessary skills to become a successful translational science researcher.

Showalter Research Trust Fund. The areas of appropriate biomedical research, eligible for funding, are broad and described by the benefactors as \"the type of medical research that is most likely to permanently benefit mankind.\" Donor intent prohibits the use of Showalter Trust funds for research in psychiatry, sociology, or social studies. Only current full-time faculty (non-visiting status) having a primary appointment in IUSM and a rank of assistant professor or assistant scientist are eligible to apply for funding from the Showalter Research Trust. Note that the same proposal may not be submitted as both a Biomedical Research Grant and a Showalter Trust application. If eligible for both programs, the investigator is encouraged to submit to the Showalter Trust. Applications for funding from the Ralph W. and Grace M.
