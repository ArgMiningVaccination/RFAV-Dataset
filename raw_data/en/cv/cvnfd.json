Search period: Inception - March 2014Inclusion Criteria: (i) hu- man studies in adults that compare ESR, fecal calprotectin, or fecallactoferrin with confirmeddiagnosis of IBD with IBS or healthy control (HC) subjects (ii) studies thatutilize the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for fecal calprotectin, not thepoint of care testing (iii)used Manning or Rome Criteria for IBS diagnosis (iv) provided sufficientdata (studies must givemedians and either confi- dence intervals for the median, interquartile ran-ges, or ranges). Exclusion Criteria: If the- re were multiple paperspublished based on thesame or overlapping data sets, then only the paper with the highest numberof subjects, the most de-tailed results, and the longest follow-up time was included.Intervention: N = 2145: 1059 IBD, 595 IBS, and 491 HC. The IBD, IBS, and HCcohorts were 52.7 %,29.9 %, and 53.5 % male, respectively. The mean age for the IBD,IBS, and HC cohorts was 40.7 (\u00b1 tients with IBS inflam- (HCs). C-reactiveprotein: A CRP level of 1.7 mg/dl has a > 52 % predictive probability of IBD. Levels > 2.7 mg/dl havemore than a 90 % likelihoodof IBD. A CRP of 0.5 pre- dicted a 1 % or lower likeli- hood of IBD.Erythrocyte sedimentationrate: An elevated level of ESR was not predictive of IBD and did not discrimina-te IBD patients from those with IBS or HCs. Fecal calprotectin: For IBD, as the level of fecal calpro-tectin increases, so does the likelihood of IBD with the maximal predictive value of78.7 % at 1000 /g. Howe- ver, a patient with a level of <4 0 g/g has a 1 % chance or less of having IBD. On theother hand, a low or high level of fecal calprotectin could not completelyexclude IBS. Fecal lactoferrin: In IBD, the maximal predictive likeli- hood of disease for fecallactoferrin was 20.4 % at1810 g/g. A level of 10 g/g had a 2 % probability of IBD. Author 's Conclusion: CRP and calprotectin of 0.5 or 40, respectively, essentially excludes IBD in patients with IBS symptoms. Theaddition of CRP and calpro- tectin to symptom-based criteria may improve theconfident diagnosis of IBS.Costa F (2003) Dig Liver Dis Carroccio A (2003) Clin Chem Dolwani S (2004) AlimentPharmacol TherSchoepfer AM (2013) Inflamm Bowel Dis Schroder O (2007) Ther Li XG (2006) Beijing Da Xue Xue BaoStrid H (2013) J CrohnsColitis Boehm Chem Lab MedOikonomou KA (2012)J Gastroenterol Sidhu Pharmacol TherWassell J (2004) Ann ClinBiochemFunding Sources: This study was supported by Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan Health System.COI: Potential competing inte- rests: William D.

The areas called into question through the QUADAStool included the representativespectrum of the diagnostic stud- ies as 8 of the 12 had recruited patients with the target disor-ders (IBS and IBD) and HCs. Forseven studies, some participants received verification of their diagnosis of IBD using a differentreference standard. Five of the studies did not have clear se- lection criteria described nor wasthe selection of who received theindex test random. Finally, there were unclear data for the delay between the tests, blinding ofthe reference test, and detailsregarding whether the reference standard was independent of the index test.Heterogeneity: For CRP IBD, IBS, and HC groups, the I2 %, and 0 %,respectively.Publication Bias: Not investiga- ted.

NBI is a relatively new tech-nique that has extensively been studied in the last few years as it has becomecommercially available allover the world. Until now, NBI has failed to demons- trate an improved detectionof neoplasia in the colon,and therefore its use in routine clinical practice will likely not improve the yieldof neoplasia. The value of NBI for differentiating neo- plastic from nonneoplasticcolon polyps has proven tobe associated with high sensitivity and specificity in experienced hands. Resultson differentiation with NBIseem comparable to results achieved with chromoen- doscopy however, futureresearch should focus ondefining learning curves, interobserver variation, and validation in generalpractice.of the Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam has been provided with loan endoscopic equipment by Olympus Inc, Tokyo, Japan.Study Quality: Low or unclear quality regarding patient selec- tion in 6 of 8 studies.Low or unclear quality regardingpossibility for replication of the index test and reference stand- a r di n5o f8s t u d i e s .Low or unclear quality regardingapplicability of results in daily practice in 7 of 8 studies.

Strikingly, the combined assessment of dysplasia andaneuploidy is superiorcompared to applying each parameter alone. Thus, tection of dysplasia and/oraneuploidy will indicate high-risk patients affording timely follow-up. Conversely, patients withnormal findings on DNA content and histopatho- logic evaluation can beexamined less frequently.Thus, aneuploidy assess- ment should become part of guidelines ascomplementing risk para-meter.Choi WT (2015) Hum Pathol Sjoqvist GastroenterolHolzmann K rectum J Surg 86Karlen Gastro-enterology Befrits R enterology Lofberg rectumNotes: Lofberg R (1987) GutFunding Sources: This study was conducted in connection to the North German Tumor Bankof Colorectal Cancer (ColoNet), generously supported by the German Cancer Aid Foundation(DKH e.

Presence of bubbles: significantly higher in PEGBIS group (76/106 patients, 71.7 %) as compared with4L PEG group (38/105 patients, 36.2 %) (P < 0.001). Compliance: Poor (less than 75 % solution intake) in 2/106 patients in PEGBIS group, 15/105 patients inthe 4L PEG group (OR = 0.11, 95 % CI, 0.02 -0.52, P = 0.002). Tolerability and Safety: No or mild discomfort from preparation intake in 83 % of patients with PEGBISand 44.8 % with 4L PEG (P < 0.0001).Acceptance: Willingness to repeat preparation by 94.3 % in PEGBIS group and 61.9 % in 4L PEG group (P < 0.001).Safety: No SAE in both groups. Author 's Conclusion: In conclusion, our study demonstrates that lowvolume PEG solution plusbisacodyl may represent a valid alternative tostandard 4L PEG solution, with a better patient compliance, tolerance, and acceptability these factors may have a positive impact on the quality ofcolonoscopy and m ay play an important role on patients 'adherence to surveillance programs. The study also demonstrates that the clinical characte- ristics of the disease activity do not influence thesafety and efficacy of preparation. Finally, the study confirms that several concepts regarding bowel cleansing are true for both general population andpatients with UC: in particular, the time intervalfrom solution intake and colonoscopy is the most important factor affecting quality of bowel clean- sing and should be shortened to less than 6 hours.Funding Sources: Not stated.

Con-sidering costeffectiveness, a targeted biopsy seemsto be more effective than a random biopsy. When performing a targeted biopsy, it is recommended that a random biopsy sample be taken from therectum. On the other hand, when performing arandom biopsy, obtaining biopsy specimens from areas without any signs of present or past inflam- mation can be omitted, which can reduce thenumber of unnecessary biopsies and increase the efficacy of the random biopsy.from Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan and Grants by JSCCR (to Toshiaki Watanabe).

The primary outcomewas a combined clinical andendoscopic remission. Bu- desonide-MMX \u00ae9 mg daily was superior to placebo forinducing remission at eightweeks. 15 % (71/462) of patients in the budesonide- MMX \u00ae9m gg r o u pa c h i e v e d remission compared to 7 % (30/438) placebo group (RR 2.25, 95 % CI 1.50 to 3.39).A GRADE analysis indicatedthat the quality of evidence supporting the primary outcome was moderate.A pooled analysis of twostudies (440 participants) suggests that a lower dose of budesonide-MMX \u00ae6m g was not superior to placebo for induction of remission. Eleven per cent (25/230) ofpatients in the budesonide-MMX \u00ae6m gg r o u pa c h i e v e d remission compared to 6 % (13/210) of placebo pa-tients (RR 1.80, 0.94 to3.42).

Weused the GRADE (Grading of Re- e310 Lynen Index, the Truelo- ve and Witt 'sS e v e r i t y Index, and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis ActivityIndex and the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS)Exclusion Criteria: There were no exclusions based on patient age or the type, dose, durationorformulationof budeso-nide therapy.9 mg patients achieved re-mission in 18 % (41/232) of patients compared to 6 % of placebo patients. The relati-ve risk was 2.89 (95 % CI 1.59 to 5.25;), suggesting that budesonide-MMX \u00aemay be more effective in patientswho are not mesalamine- refractory, which did not change when sensitivityanalysis was applied.Subgroup analysis: Remission rates according to disease location: A pooled analysis of two studies (Sandborn 2012; Travis 2014), shows that bu- desonide-MMX \u00ae9 mg daily was significantly more effi-cacious than placebo for treatment of patients with left-sided disease (289 pa-tients) but not for patientswith extensive disease (145 patients). Among those with left-sided disease 22 % (32/145) of budesonide-MMX \u00ae 9 mg patients entered re- mission com- pared to 8 % (11/144) of placebo patients(RR 2.98, 95 % CI 1.56 to 5.67). Among those with extensive disease 9 % (8/85)of budesonide-MMX \u00ae9m g patients entered remission compared to 3 % (2/60) of placebo patients (RR 2.41,95 % CI 0.61 to 9.56).8.

Heterogeneity: Two authors in- dependently evaluated the eligi-ble studies for clinical and me- thodological heterogeneity. We used the Chi 2test to assess heterogeneity, with a P-value of< 0.10 considered statistically significant. To estimate the degree of heterogeneity acrossstudies, we used the I 2statistic. A value of 25 % is considered to indicate low heterogeneity, 50 %moderate heterogeneity and75 % high heterogeneity. Publication Bias: \"We planned to assess publication bias bymeans of a funnel plot. However,given that we identified only six eligible studies, three of which were not suitable for combinedanalysis, a funnel plot was notconstructed. \" Notes: Due to differences of study design, not all studiescould be used for the same meta-analysis. e311 Lynen Verlages. enced at least one adverse event compared to 53 % of placebo patients (RR 1.13, 95 % CI 0.97 to 1.32). AGRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcomewas very low due to a highlevel of heterogeneity (I2 = 86 %) and sparse data. Commonly reported adver-se events include worseningulcerative colitis, headache, pyrexia, insomnia, back pain, nausea, abdominalpain, diarrhoea, flatulence and na- sopharyngitis. Author 's Conclusion: - Moderate quality evidenceto support the use of oral budesonide-MMX \u00aeat a 9 mg daily dose for induc-tion of remission in activeulcerative colitis, particular- ly in patients with left-sided colitis. Budesonide-MMX \u00ae 9 mg daily is effective forinduction of remission in the presence or absence of con- current 5-ASA therapy.

Moderate quality evi- dence from a single studysuggests that mesalaminemay be superior to standard budesonide for the treat- ment of active ulcerativecolitis. Low quality evidence from one study found no difference in remission ratesbetween budesonide MMX \u00ae and mesalamine.

Author 's Conclusion: The effectiveness of topical5-ASA for inducing remis- sion is confirmed. The abi- lity of topical 5-ASA to in-duce clinical remission wasclearly shown in several placebo-controlled studies. Patients receiving topical 5-ASA were 2.39 times more likely to achieve clini- cal remission than thosereceiving placebo. No cleardose response relationship was found between topical 5-ASA and clinical remissi-on, although only 2 studiescompared different 5-ASA doses. Additionally, endos- copic evaluations in 4 stud-ies showed a clear benefit oftopical 5-ASA over placebo. Histological remission rates were assessed in only 2studies and showed no clear benefit of topical 5-ASA over placebo.Andus T, (2010) Inflamm (1988) J ClinGastroenterolCampieri M, (1990) Scand JGastroenterol Campieri M, (1990) Int J Dis Aliment PharmacolTher Farup PG, Hanauer SB, (2005) Dis Pokrotnieks J, (2000)Aliment Pharmacol Ther van (1980) Gut Pharmacol TherWatanabe M, Sources: n.a.

Exclusion Criteria: Clini- cal studies of pouchitis orcuffitis and case reports were excluded from the rectal therapies: ASAs, corticosteroids,and non -5-ASA agents, and provides ratings for the quality of the evidence.Comparison: Placebo, or different forms of administration of thesame drug.Primary: Efficacy of current litera- ture supports the use of rectal therapies for bothinduction and maintenance o fr e m i s s i o ni np a t i e n t s with distal forms of UC.Efficacy: A greater percen- tage of patients with distal forms of UC receiving 5-aminosalicylic acids orcorticosteroid rectal formu-lations derived greater therapeutic benefit after treatment compared withpatients receiving placebo.Most uncontrolled studies of rectal therapies reported that patients with distalforms of UC had marked improvement from baseline after treatment. Safety: The overall safety profile of rectal therapies was favorable. Treatment with second-generation cor-ticosteroids, such as bude-sonide and beclomethasone dipropionate, did not in- crease the incidence of ste-roid-related adverse effects. Author 's Conclusion: Over- all, most rectal therapies,regardless of formulation,were shown to be well tole- rated and efficacious for both the treatment of activeUC and for the maintenanceof UC remission. Avoiding systemic corticosteroid exposure by using non -ste- roid-containing agents ortherapies with second- generation corticosteroids, such as budesonide andBDP, should be emphasized when selecting topical the- rapies for patients withthese conditions.Gross VB, (2006) AlimentPharmacol TherAndus T, (2010) InflammBowel Dis. 2010 Watanabe M, (2013) Aliment Pharmacol TherCampieri M, (1990) Int JColorectal Dis Campieri M, (1990) Scand J GastroenterolLamet M, (2005) Inflamm Bowel Dis Eliakim R, (2007) AlimentPharmacol TherPokrotnieks J, (2000) Pharmacol Ther Aumais RDSutherland LR, (2009) DigestionCortot A, (2008) Am (2005) LR, (1987) Dig Dis SciHammond A, (2004)Hepato-gastroenterology Hartmann F, (2010) Aliment Pharmacol TherBiancone L, (2007) Dig Liver Dis Gionchetti P, (2005) J ClinGastroenterolLindgren S, (2002) Scand J Ginsberg AL, (1988) AnnIntern Med Gandolfo no con-flicts of interest to disclose.

However, it is unknown whether the for-mulation is also efficacious in patients with moresevere UC because the subjects in this study were patients with mild-to-moderate active UC. Mesala- mine is considered safer than corticosteroids. Ac-cordingly, further research will be necessary to fully evaluate the role of mesalamine formulations for the treatment of severe UC. If this is accomplished,it is likely that mesalamine contributes to the im-provement in the quality of life of patients with UC.to the inflamed areas (proctitis- type or others) and the severity of the disease (range of UC-DAI at ini- tial assessment: 3 -5o r6 use of a biased-coin minimizati- on algorithm.

It was shown thatthe proportion of patientswho achieved steroid-free remission was higher in groups that received theTNF-a blockers than in theplacebo treated groups (RR = % [1.77, 4.96], p,0.0001).Mucosal healing was eval- uated 5 of 1345 patients, to deter-mine TNF-a blocker treat-ment efficacy. Of these, 3 trials compared anti-TNF-a agents with a placebo con-trol. Patients were given in-fliximab in 2 trials and ada- limumab in the third trial. No heterogeneity wasdetected when comparingt h e s e3t r i a l s( I 2=3 7% , p = 0.20). A pooled analysis using fixed-effects modelsshowed the TNF-a blocker was significantly superior to placebo for healing of themucosa (RR = 1.89; 95 %[1.55, 2.31], p,0.00 001) The rate of colectomy was only reported within 3 ofthe included trials, whichevaluated a total of 863 patients. The data demon- strated that more patientsin the placebo group (36/ 244) than in the infliximab group (46/484) had a co-l e c t o m y ,a ss h o w ni nF i g .7 .This difference in colecto- my rate is statistically sig- nificant (RR = 0.64; 95 %[0.43, 0.97], p = 0.03, Figu-re. 7), indicating the benefit of infliximab treatment. Data synthesis: Serious side effects Serious side effects were reported in 6 of the trials,consisting of 2088 patients.Within these trials, the fre- quency of serious side ef- fects was 16.9 % in the anti-TNF-a group, 20.0 % in theplacebo group and 24.7 % in cyclosporine group. Of the- se, 4 trials administered aplacebo as a control and 1used cyclosporine.

A pooled analysis using fixed effects modelsshowed the occurrence of serious side effects was equivalent between TNF-aand placebo receiving pa-tients (RR = 0.83; 95 %[0.69, 1.00], Z = 1.98, p = 0.05) Author 's Conclusion: In summary, this meta- analy-sis has updated the atment field and demon- strated that TNF-a blockerswere superior for patient treatment as compared to placebo. This conclusionwas based on increasedachievement of clinical remission and mucosal he- aling and reduction in theneed for colectomy, combi-ned with no significant, se- vere side effects. Using anti- TNF-a also spares patientsthe effects of corticosteroidtreatment, which is used when the patients have re- fractory UC nonresponsiveto conventional treatment. Additionally, infliximab and cyclosporine are compara-ble when used as rescuetherapy in acute severe steroid- refractory UC, alt- hough, more randomizedtrials are needed to furtherevaluate the efficacy of these agents. So, in se- lected patients with mode-rate to severe active ulcera- tive colitis who have failed to respond or are poorlyresponsive to standardpharmacologic forms of treatment with corticoste- roids and immunosuppres-sive agents, therapy with ananti-TNF-a agent may be considered. In addition, it may be necessary to iden-tify biomarkers that indica- tive of patients who will respond to the TNF-a inhi-bitor. Komaki, Y et al.

Author 's Conclusion: In conclusion, this meta-anal-ysis does not find any defni-tive preference with regard to IFX and cyclosporine for steroid-refractory acute se-vere UC. Optimized dosingof IFX requires 3-dose in- duction and possibly higher or more frequent dosesguided by therapeutic drugmonitoring, but more pro- spective data are needed. Observational data suggestbetter treatment response and lower risk of colectomy at 12 months with IFX com-pared with cyclosporine,with comparable short- term adverse events; how- ever, this increase in appa-rent benefit from observa-tional studies may well reflect residual confoun- ding rather than true cau-sality. Studies are ongoing to determine how to maxi- mize the therapeutic bene-fit of IFX in the setting ofacute severe UC and pro- spective studies comparing dose-optimized IFX tocyclosporine may providemore definitive insight into this debate.more conservative estimate than am i x e d - e f f e c t sm o d e l . \" Heterogeneity was low between RCTs and high between non-ran-domized studies (I 2:69 and 71 % for 3 and 12 month colectomy rate).Publication Bias: Symmetrical distribution of the studies on the plot suggests no publication bi- as.

Ann Methodical Evidence level: 2 Study type: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 6 observational studies Databases: Pubmed Search period: 1960 - 01.01.2015 Inclusion Criteria: Any article published and in-dexed on PubMed thatassessed the use of in iximab or cyclosporine as third- line salvage therapyfollowing the initial failureof intravenous corticoste- roids and either in iximab or cyclosporine. In orderto be included, the use of the third- line agent had to be within 60 days ofcessation of the priordrug. Exclusion Criteria: Articles not indexed on PubMed, Abstracts onlypresented at a medicalconference but not pu- blished as a manuscript, case reports of only a sin-gle patient and review ar- ticles were also excluded.Intervention: Poupu- lation:The mean age ofthe patients was 42 and 43 % (13/30) of patients were female.The average durationof disease was 6.7 ye- ars and the majority of patients (77 %, 23/30)had extensive colitis.Seventy-three percent (22/30) of patients Infli-ximab (IFX) followingCylcosporin (CSA) as third line treatment (not reported here)Comparison: -Primary: Our primary out- comes were clinical remis-sion and serious adverse events associated with each drug and in aggregate.Secondary: Secondary outcomes included clinical response and 12 month colectomy rates.Results: Two studies asses- sed salvage therapy with CSA following IFX: There was a mean of 20 days(range 19 -21) between the last dose of IFX and starting CSA. Overall response and remis-sion event rates were 60 % (95 % CI 43 -78 %) and 18 % (95 %CI 4 -31 %) respec- tively at three months.The event rate was 57 % (95 %CI 39-74 %). No deaths among patients occurred,but 10 % (3/30) of all the patients developed an in- fectious complication. Ot-her complications included renal and hepatic abnorma- lities, fatigue, leg cramps,weakness, cough, and pan-creatitis. Serious adverse event rate was 12 % (95 %CI 0.01 -23 %), and total ad- verse event rate was 31 %(95 %CI 16 -47 %). Author 's Conclusion: In conclusion, third-line salva-ge therapy with either CSA or IFX is efficacious in some patients but carries a signif- icant risk of complications.Importantly, 41 -57 % of these patients will end up requiring a colectomywithin 12 months.

The riskof sequential therapy in steroid-refractory UC seems lower than initiallyreported. However, the evidence is limited as data from prospective controlledtrials are missing. The se-quence of IFX followed by calcineurin inhibitors, or vice versa, appear to havesimilar treatment outcomesregarding avoidance of co- lectomy and risk of adverse events. Sequential rescue therapy should only be per- formed at specialized refer- ral centers familiar with theuse of calcineurin inhibiti-on.

Thirty-eight per cent of patients in the5-ASA group relapsed com-pared to 37 % of patients in the 5-ASA comparator group (5 studies, 457 pa-tients; RR 1.01, 95 % CI 0.80 to 1.28).

Author 's Conclusion: It is clear that oral 5-ASA prepa-rations have yet to be prov- en to be more clinically be- neficial than SASP. Maleinfertility is associated withSASP and not with 5-ASA, so 5- ASA may be preferred for patients concernedabout fertility. 5-ASA thera- py is more expensive than SASP, so SASP may be thepreferred option where costis an important factor. 5- ASA could also be offered to patients who are intolerantto SASP. Oral 5-ASA admi-nistered once daily is as effective and safe as con- ventional dosing (twice orthree times daily) for main- tenance in quiescent colitis.Once daily dosing does notappear to enhance adhe- rence in the clinical trial setting.

Noclear dose response rela- tionship was found bet- ween topical 5-ASA andclinical remission, although only 2 studies compared different 5-ASA doses.Andus T, (2010) J Clin GastroenterolCampieri M, (1990) Scand J Gastroenterol Campieri J, (2000)Aliment Pharmacol Gut van Hogezand Pharmacol Ther Watanabe DisSciFunding Sources: n.a.

Doses of 2.0 g/ day appeared more effec-tive than < 2.0 g/day for preventing relapse (RR = 0.79; 95 % CI 0.64 - 0.97).Author 's Conclusion: In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysishas demonstrated a clear benefit of 5- ASAs, particu- larly mesalamine and sulfa-salazine, over placebo inboth the induction of re- mission of active UC and in preventing relapse in quies-cent UC. Increas- ing thetotal daily dose of 5-ASA used, to at least 2.0 g, appears to both increasethe likelihood of achievingremission and reduce the risk of disease relapse.Study Quality: Risk of bias was assessed as described in the Cochrane handbook (14), by recording the method used togenerate the randomization schedule, the method used to conceal allocation, whether blin-ding was implemented, whatproportion of patients comple- ted follow- up, whether an in- tention-to-treat analysis wasextractable, and whether therewas evidence of selective repor- ting of outcomes. Heterogeneity: I 2was used as a measure of heterogeneity. A value < 25 % was arbitrarily cho- sen to represent low levels of he-terogeneity. We also evaluatedheterogeneity using the 2t e s t with P values < 0.15 indicating statistically significant heteroge-neity. Where the degree of sta-tistical heterogeneity was greater than this between trial r e s u l t si nt h i sm e t a - a n a l y s i s ,possible explanations were in-vestigated using sensitivity ana- lyses according to the dosage and duration of therapy, compli-ance with therapy, criteria used to define remission or relapse, duration of disease, proportionwith new-onset disease, and highrisk of bias and unclear risk of bias vs. low risk of bias trials, where trial reporting allowedthis. These were exploratoryanalyses only, and may explain some of the observed variability, but the results should be inter-preted with caution. Publication Bias: There was sta- tistically significant funnel plotasymmetry (Egger test, P = 0.02),suggesting evidence of publica- tion bias or other small study effects.Notes: Certain overlap of cited literature with SR on oral 5-ASA Feagan BG 2012 Cochrane Data- base of Systemic Review (5/11).Evidence of small study effect or publication bias in particular.

Relap-se of UC : After 52 weeks of therapy, 54 % of vedolizu- mab patients had a clinicalrelapse compared to 84 % ofplacebo patients (RR 0.67, 95 % CI 0.59 to 0.77; 1 stu- dy, 373 patients). GRADEanalyses indicated that the overall quality of the evi- dence for the primary out-comes was high for induc-tion of remission and moderate for relapse (due to sparse data 246 events).Secondary: Adverse events: There was no statistically significant difference bet- ween vedolizumab and pla-cebo in terms of the risk of any adverse event (RR 0.99, 95 % CI 0.93 to 1.07), orserious adverse events (RR1.01, 95 % CI 0.72 to 1.42). There was a statistically sig- nificant difference in with-drawals due to adverseevents.

Heterogeneity: \"The presence of heterogeneity among studieswas assessed using the chi2 test, a P value of 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant. The I2statistic was used to quantifyinconsistency (Higgins 2003). This statistic describes the per- centage of the variability ineffect estimates that are due to heterogeneity rather than sam- pling error. A value greater than50 % was considered evidence ofsubstantial heterogeneity. In the presence of significant hetero- geneity, pooled analysis was notperformed. If homogeneity waslikely (I2 < 0.03), pooled RR with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using a fixed-effectmodel based on the method by Mantel and Haenszel as a primary analysis. \" High heterogeneity (P = 0.03;I2 = 79 %) prevented the the compared analysis of 6-MP to 5-ASA and AZA to sulfasalazine.Publication Bias: \"The number of eligible trials was too small to assess the occurrence of publi- cation bias, or any bias arisingfrom differences in methodolo-gical quality. \" e346 Lynen AZA and control in the inci- dence of adverse events. 9 % (11/127) of azathiopri- ne patients experienced atleast one adverse event compared to 2 % (3/130) of placebo patients (5 studies,257 patients; RR 2.82, 95 %CI 0.99 to 8.01). Patients receiving AZA were at significantly increasedrisk of withdrawing due toadverse events. Eight per cent (8/101) of AZA patients withdrew dueto adverse events compar- ed to 0 % (0/98) of control patients (5 studies, 199 pa-tients; RR 5.43, 95 % CI 1.02to 28.75). Adverse events related to study medication included acute pancreatitis(3 cases, plus 1 case oncyclosporin) and significant bone marrow suppression (5 cases).Deaths, opportunisticinfection or neoplasia were not reported. Author 's Conclusion: Azathioprine therapy appe- ars to be more effective than placebo for mainten-ance of remission in ulcera-tive colitis. Azathioprine or 6-mercap- topurine may be effectiveas maintenance therapy forpatients who have failed or cannot tolerate mesalazine or sulfasalazine and for pa-tients who require repeated courses of steroids. More research is needed toevaluate superiority overstandard maintenance the- rapy, especially in the light of a potential for adverseevents from azathioprine.In the risk of bias assessment for the individual studies, 4 were judged to be at low risk of repor- ting bias, in 3 studies reportingbias was unclear to the investi- gators. Notes: Inclusion of unblinded trials introduces bias to the in-vestigation. Overall n is small and important comparisons between interventions were preventeddue to heterogeneity.The comparison of Azathioprin with Placebo yields the most meaningful results. e347 Lynen Jansen P bei CU W J et al.

No mi- nimum disease duration was pre-specified. Patients had an inade- quate response to, or had failed to tolerate, 1 or more of the fol-lowing conventional oral 5- aminosalicylates orcorticosteroids were to receive astable dose for at least 2 weeks before baseline, and patients re- ceiving AZA and/or 6- mercapto-purine were to receive a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before baseline. Patients were requiredto maintain stable doses of theirconcomitant UC medications during the study. \" Exclusion Criteria: Extracted from referenced article: \"Patients with a history of, or at imminent risk for, colectomy; who required gastrointestinal surgery within 2months before screening; had colitis limited to 20 cm of the colon (patients with ulcerativeproctitis often have rectal blee-ding as the primary clinical mani- festation of the disease, thus, the utility of the Mayo score in thispatient population is less clear);or had a history of colonic muco- sal dysplasia or adenomatous colonic polyps that were not re-moved, were ineligible.Patients were excluded if their screening stool study was positive for enteric pathogens or Clostri-dium difficile toxin.

Patients were assessed for UC diseaseactivity using the Mayo score at weeks 30 and 54 and by partial Mayo score every 4 weeks (loss of response was confirmed by endoscopy) to substan-tiate that patients had maintained clinical responseat each visit. Therefore, patients who maintained clinical response were considered to be in a state of continuous clinical response through week 54. Secondary: Secondary: The analysis population for major secondary end points was golimumab- inducti- on responders. Prespecified major secondary end points were as follows: (1) clinical remission at bothweeks 30 and 54; (2) mucosal healing at both weeks30 and 54; (3) clinical remission at both weeks 30 and 54 among patients who had clinical remission at PURSUIT- M baseline; and (4) corticosteroid-free cli-nical remission at week 54 among patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids at PURSUIT-M baseline. Results: Primary: Clinical response was maintained through week 54 in 47.0 % of patients receiving50 mg golimumab, 49.7 % of patients receiving 100 mg golimumab, and 31.2 % of patients recei- ving placebo (P = .010 and P<.001 respectively>Secondary: Clinical remission: At weeks 30 and 54, a higher percentage of patients who received 100 mg golimumab were in clinical remission and had mucosal healing (27.8 % and 42.4 %) than pa-tients given placebo (15.6 % and 26.6 %; P = .004 and P = .002, respectively) or 50 mg golimumab (23.2 % and 41.7 % espectively).serious adverse events Occurred in 7.7 %, 8.4 %, and 14.3 % among patients given placebo, 50 mg, or 100 mg golimumab, respectively; percentages of serious infections were 1.9 %, 3.2 %, and 3.2 %, re-spectively. Among all patients given golimumab inthe study, 3 died (from sepsis, tuberculosis, and cardiac failure, all in patients who received 100 mg goli- mumab) and 4 developed active tuberculosis. Author 's Conclusion: both golimumab doses ad- ministered as an every-4-weeks SC maintenance regimen in patients with moderate- to-severe activeUC who were induced into clinical response withgolimumab were effective in maintaining clinical response through 1 year. Further, patients receiving the 100-mg golimumab dose achieved long- termclinical remission and mucosal healing at both weeks30 and 54, in addition to showing positive trends for maintenance of clinical remis- sion through 1 year. There was a positive relationship between the main-tenance of clinical response and serum golimumabconcentration. Maintenance treatment with goli- mumab resulted in an overall safety profile in this UC population that was consistent with those reportedfor other TNFa- antagonists and with golimumab in other approved indications.Funding Sources: The study was funded by Janssen Research & De- velopment, LLC (Spring House, PA).

The resultsof these studies should beinterpreted with a degree of caution based on the un- derlying limitations of thestudy designs.Following the launch of CT-P13 in several major European countries, healtheconomic studies have emerged evaluating the budget impact and costeffectiveness (from a payeror patient perspective) of introducing the biosimilar into the chronic inflamma-tory disease market.

Weused the GRADE approach forrating the overall quality of ev- idence for the primary outcomes and selected secondary outco-mes of interest. Six studies wererated as low risk of bias. Three studies were rated as high risk of bias due to blinding (two openlabel and one single-blind). Heterogeneity: \"Heterogeneity was assessed using the 2test Verlages. analyses by disease extent and 5-ASA dose were also planned. Because of anti- cipated heterogeneity inthe definition of these outcomes, those of the original authors wereaccepted.Exclusion Criteria: n.a.P = 0.15). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome waslow due to imprecision (i. e. sparse data 50 events) and high risk of bias (i. e. bothstudies in the pooled analy-sis were open label). 80 % of patients in the rectal 5-ASA group maintained endosco-pic remission compared to70 % of patients in the oral 5-ASA group (2 studies; 91 patients; RR 1.14, 95 % CI0.90 to 1.45; I 2=0% ; P = 0.26).

In this study, re-mission was maintained in69.0 % and 58.1 % for the SASP and olsalazine groups, respectively, although thisdifference was not statisti-cally significant. Author 's Conclusion: The role of topical 5-ASA as firstline treatment for UP hasbeen confirmed in this re- view, both for induction and maintenance of remission.Additionally, there is limited evidence available for the superiority of topical 5-ASAcompared with oral 5-ASAin UP. As such, this review will not change the first line treatment for patients withUP.Because of the paucity of studies examining other drugs than 5-ASA, this re-view cannot draw any con- clusions on which drug is the most optimal secondline therapy in UP. Similarly,this review cannot reliably assess the efficacy of corti- costeroids, thiopurines,or anti-TNFa therapy inpatients with UP.studies were pooled only if the direction of their results was consistent. Publication Bias: No funnel plots or tests were applied, only the assessment of reporting bias using the Cochrane handbookfor systematic review.\"The risk of reporting bias was considered low because no stud- ies reported post-hoc analyses. \" Notes: No investigation of publi- cation bias. High heterogeneity despite random effects models.

Exclusion Criteria: Analy- ses were excluded becau-se of high risk of publica- tion bias. Studies with exclusively pediatric pa-tients ( 15 years), a diag- nosis of Crohn 's disease, indeterminate colitis, oran unclear diagnosis of UCwere also excluded.Intervention: Popula- tion: 2073 UC patient with vention other thancontinuation of currentprescribed. Comparison: no com- parison.Primary: Long term clinical remission (CR): defined asCR at 52 weeks and at least 6 months after endos- copic assessment for MH1.Secondary: Long-term co- lectomy-free rate, MH rate, and CS-free CR rate at 52 weeks and at least 6months after MH1 assess-ment. Results: We analyzed 13 studies comprising 2073patients with active UC. Pa-tients with MH1 had pooled odds ratio of 4.50 for achie- ving long-term (after atleast 52 weeks) clinical remission (95 %CI, 2.12 - 9.52), 4.15 for remainingfree of colectomy (95 % CI,2.53 -6.81), 8.40 for achie- ving long-term MH (95 % CI, 3.13 -22.53), and 9.70 for achieving long-term corti-costeroid-free clinical remission (95 % CI, 0.94 - 99.67), compared with pa-tients without MH1. We found no difference in out- comes if patients achievedMH1 while receiving biolo-gic versus non-biologic therapy. Author 's Conclusion: Tar- geting MH may be asso-ciated with better long- term outcomes compared with targeting patient-re-ported outcomes alone and has been shown to be a predictor of improved dis- ease course and long-termprognosis, consistent with the results presented in this meta-analysis of more than2000 active UC patients. Onthe basis of our findings and in the absence of published prospective RCTs, it seemsreasonable that achievingMH should be the goal of UC treatment, and interval endoscopic assessmentshould be performed after initiating new therapies to evaluate response and gui-Paoluzi OA, (2002) A, (2014) Ann Gastro-enterolCabriada JL, (2010) Dig Liver Dis Dai C, (2014) PLoS OneParente F, (2010) Am J Gastroenterol DisColombel JF, n.a.

Secondary: Results: After systematically applying in-clusion criteria, we identi- fied 108 scientific articles including 88 clinical studiesand 21 related clinicalreviews. Eighteen indices of histological activity in UC were identified andreviewed.Author 's Conclusion: In summary, histopathology is an important component ofUC assessment both inclinical practice and for cli- nical trials, with potential long-term implications forpredicting remission rates, future surgery, and mali- gnancy risk. Currently, theuse of a partially validatedscore such as the Geboes score or the MRS seems optimal for clinical researchpurposes, but requires furt-her validation. Ideally, im- provements to current indi- ces or development of newindices will lead to stand- ardized methods of histolo- gical assessment that canbe employed in both clinicalpractice and in clinical trials.Truelove SC, (1956) Br Med J Riley SA, (2000) Gut Matts SG, (1961) Q J Med Watts JM, (1966) GutKeren DF, (1984) Hum Pathol Friedman L, (1985) Gastro-enterologyGomes P, Gut Saverymuttu SH, (1986) GastroenterologyFloren CH, (1987) Scand JGastroenterol Hanauer S, (1993) Am J GastroenterolOdze R, (1993) Am J SurgPathol Sandborn WJ, (1993) Am J GastroenterolScheppach W, (1992) Gastroenterology D'Argenio G, (2001) Dig Dis SciFiel M, (2003) Mod Pathol Riley SA, (1988) Gastroen- support from Millen- bott, J&J/Janssen.

Author 's Conclusion: In summary, this study de-monstrates that antiviraltherapy is not required for all patients with UC with CMV disease but may bebeneficial in a subgroup ofpatients who are refractory to CS. However, the quality of evidence supporting co-lectomy risk and antiviral therapy was low and there- fore insufficient to changecurrent clinical practice.Further prospective con- trolled trials will help to confirm these findings andto identify subgroups ofpatients who might benefit from antiviral therapy.

Seven of the 9 case reports reported no remission forthe patients while one casereport provided no data on remission.

Four case reports described IBD as a new onset (event) in an HIV-infected patient.There is a paucity of data in the literature to support or reject the hypothesis thatCD4 count depletion mayinduce remission of bowel inflammation in IBD pa- tients.There is a trend supportingthe CD4 hypothesis and most reports seem to sug- gest that IBD might be lessaggressive in patients infected with HIV. Author 's Conclusion: Current literature cannotsupport or reject the CD4 count remission hypothesis in IBD patients with HIVinfection.

Results: 12 studies were found eligible (four trials of natalizumab, six of vedoli-zumab and two of etrolizu-mab). The RR of developing an opportunistic infection was not significantly higherwith non-gut specific (2.34;95 % CI 0.05 -108.72) or gut specific anti-integrin antibodies (1.55; 95 % CI0.16 -14.83). The RR was generally higher in trials of non-gut specific anti- inte-grin antibodies with dura-tion of therapy 52 weeks (RR = 15.00; 95 % CI 0.86 - 261), but remained non-significant. The RR of mali-gnancy was not elevated with non-gut specific (1.57; 95 % CI 0.19 -12.74) or gut specific anti-integrin anti-bodies (0.78; 95 % CI 0.15 - 4.02). Author 's Conclusion: Ab- solute numbers of opportu- nistic infections were higher with anti-integrin antibo-dies, but this difference isnot statistically significant. There was no increased risk of malignancy detected.Long-term data in largeprospective cohorts are needed to further assess this issue.Targan SR, (2007) Gastro- enterology Sands BE, (2007) Inflamm Bowel Disof patients had incomplete out- comes data, and whether there was evidence of selective repor- ting of outcomes were all recor-ded.

Publication Bias: \"There were too few studies containing theevents of interest to reliably as-sess for evidence of publication bias, or other small study effects. \" Notes: Pooling of results from UC and CD studies likely causes bias and problems in reprodu-cing the findings. Study qualitywas unclear in 8 out of 12 stu- dies. Despite the considerable sample size the opportunisticinfection rates are low, whichnaturally aggravates statistical analysis and the presented results are non- significant. Narula, N. et al.

Author 's Conclusion: The laparoscopic IPAAis a safeprocedure, that could beperformed successfully in centres in lapa- roscopic and restorativepouch surgery. The laparos- copic approach seems to be associated with some short-term advantages regardingpostoperative recovery, but these advantages seem to be limited and their clinicalsignificance is arguable. Fora complex operation like the IPAA other outcomes, like specific complications, long-term functional outcome,cosmesis and costs aremore likely to influence the choice e386 Lynen Jansen des Verlages. of the operative technique. This review have shown that for cosmesis there are some data favouring the laparos-copic approach, but that the evidence is still inconclusive and more research is need-ed before a general recom-mendation can be made. There is also some evidence that costs, a crucial item intoday 's health care, may not become a decisive item in the decision between open and laparoscopic IPAA. Bartels S. A. et al.

Specific complications such as peritoneal abscess,anastomotic leakage, andintestinal obstruction did not differ between laparos- copic group and opengroup. However, clinical value of laparoscopic sur- gery for UC needed furtherevaluation with more well-designed and long-term followup studies. Bartels, Sa et al.

Secondary: Secondary outcomes were 30-day or in- hospital morbidity, QoL and pouch function inthe first year after surgery. Complications weregraded according to the Clavien -Dindo classifica- tion of surgical complications. If a patient had multiple complications, only the most severe com-plication was graded. Anastomotic leakage wasconsidered to be present when diagnosed by CT or during reintervention. Results: 59 patients were included, (28 CRD and 31 TME). Baseline data were similar, except formore previous abdominal surgery in the TME group. Operating time was longer for patients ha- ving CRD (195 min vs. 166 min for TME; P = 0.008).More patients in the TME group had a primary defunctioning ileostomy (7 of 31 versus 1 of 28 for CRD; P = 0.055). Severe complications occurredmore frequently in the TME group (10 of 31 versus2 of 28 for CRD). QoL was better in the CRD group for several subscales of the questionnaires measured at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery. At12 months, QoL was similar in the two groups for allsubscales.

Although no sig-nificant heterogeneity wasfound among the included studies, the number of in- cluded studies was small.Therefore, the result should be interpreted with caution and further clinical studiesinvestigating the effect ofC. difficile infection on UC patients are warranted. In our analysis, we found CDIincreased the surgical ratein UC patients. If it is found that C. difficile does indeed exacerbate UC, this willhave profound influencenot only on the way we approach C. difficile testing, but also on the way we ap-proach the treatment of UC patients complicated with C. difficile.Murthy SK (2012) Aliment Pharmacol TherKaneko T R (2010) J ColitisFunding Sources: Source of Support: This work was sup-ported by the National NaturalScience Foundation of China (No. 81 000 161 and No.81 170 362).COI: None declared.

Exclusion Criteria: Stud- ies that did not containUC patients (along prior to surgery.Primary: Total complica- tion rate in a short termafter surgery (usually 30 days). Secondary: Rate of in- fectious and non- infectiouscomplications in the above period. Results: A total of 13 stud- ies involving 2933 patientswere included in our Meta- Analysis. There was no associationbetween infliximab therapypreoperatively and total ( O R=1 . 0 9 ,9 5%C I :0 . 8 7 - 1.37, P = 0.47), infectious( O R=1 . 1 0 ,9 5%C I :0 . 5 1 - 2.38, P = 0.81) and non-in- fectious (OR = 1.10, 95 % CI:0.76 P = 0.61) post- operative complications re- spectively. Infliximab might be a protective factoragainst infection for the usewithin 12 weeks prior to surgery (OR = 0.43, 95 % CI: 0.22 -0.83, P = 0.01). Author 's Conclusion: In conclusion, preoperative infliximab use does not in-crease the risk of early post-operative complications in patients with UC under- going abdominal surgery.The current practice ofsome doctors to delay ope- ration and to discontinue infliximab for 8 -12 weeks prior to elective surgery in UC patients may not be warranted.

Secondary: Intervention: Clinical outcome per protocol (PP)- based analysis; Rate of Clostridium difficile (CD) toxin detected from stool in group A compared pre- and post-surgery; occurrence ofCD-related disease.Surgical procedure for both groups: All surgeries were done with the open approach, and the incision was made in the wall of the median lower abdomen. allpatients had restorative proctocolectomy with thecreation of an ileal J-pouch ileal was made by using a linear stapler, the mucosal surface was turned over to achieve completehemostasis, and the opened bowel was closed byalbert-lembert sutures with the use of absorbable suture material (Vicryl 3 -0). IPAA was performed by using a transanal handsewn technique. thewound was protected by an alexis wound retractor, and the abdominal cavity was irrigated with 3000 ml of saline before closure. the gloves of allparticipants in the surgery were changed every 2hours. the peritoneum and fascia were sutured. the wound was irrigated with 200 ml of saline solution before closure. skin was closed with a stapler. intra-peritoneal drains were inserted through a separateincision. Results: The incidence of overall surgical site in- fection was significantly lower in group A (6/97patients, 6.1 %) than in group B (22/98 patients, 22.4 %) (p = 0.0024). In multivariate analysis, the administration of oral antibiotics (OR, 0.178; 95 %CI, 0.057 -0.552; p = 0.003) and ASA score 3( O R , 5.343; 95 % CI, 1.595 -17.891; p = 0.007) were in- dependent risk factors for surgical site infection. Author 's Conclusion: \"Our study shows that a combination of oral non- absorbable antibiotics andintravenous antibiotics significantly lowers the inci- dence of SSI compared with intravenous antibiotics alone. We therefore recommend the use of oralnonabsorbable antibiotics in addition to parenteral anti-biotics and mechanical bowel preparation in patients with UC undergoing IPAA.Funding Sources: none reported.

No RCTacute pouchitis the 12 month study compared to 60 % (12/20) of placebo patients (RR 1.50, 95 % CI1.02 to 2.21). A GRADE a- nalysis indicated that the quality of evidence suppor-ting this outcome was lowdue to very sparse data (30 events). Another small study (28 participants)found that VLS# 3 was notmore effective than no treatment for prevention of pouchitis. Bifidobacteriumlongum, allopurinol and tinidazole were not more effective than placebo forprevention of pouchitis. Theresults of these studies are uncertain due to very low quality evidence.Author 's Conclusion: For acute pouchitis, very low quality evidence suggests that ciprofloxacin may bemore effective than metro-nidazole. For chronic pou- chitis, low quality evidence suggests that VSL#3 may bemore effective than placebo for maintenance of remis- sion. For the prevention ofpouchitis, low quality evi-dence suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo. Well designed,adequately powered stud-ies are needed to determine the optimal therapy for the treatment and preventionof pouchitis.investigation or discussion of publication bias. Quality of the evidence was judged to be very low for all outcomes, mainly dueto sparsity of data. Only 2 of the 13 studies could be meta-ana- lyzed together. McCormick, P H et al.

No diffe- rence in length of stay (no details reported). Reversal: Removal of 3 pouches reported at long term follow-up (2 in fistulas, J-pouch group: 1 pelvic sepsis postoperatively). No significant difference in leak rates or postoperative complications betweengroups. Bowel Frequency: At 12-month assessment, W- pouch group had median of 5 (interquartile range(IQR) 4 -6) bowel movements over a 24-hour pe- riod, J-pouch group had a 24-hour frequency of 7 (IQR 6 -8) (p < 0.001). Daytime frequency at 1 year in W-pouch group was 4 (IQR 3 -5) and 6 (IQR 4 - 7) in the J-pouch group (p < 0.001). Nocturnal fre-quency was 1 (IQR 1 -1) in the W- pouch group and 1( I Q R1 -2) in the J-pouch group, p = 0.190. At long-term follow-up, W-pouch frequency over24-hours was 6 (IQR 4 -8) and 6.5 (IQR 5 -8) in the J- group frequency (p = 0.36). Frequency of 5 in the W- pouch group at daytime (IQR 3.5 -6.5) and 5.5 (IQR 4 -7) in the J-group (p = 0.233). Nocturnal frequency of 1 (IQR 0 -1) in both groups (p = 0.987). Urgency: No significant difference between groups at either time point.Pad Usage: No significant difference between groups at either time point. Incontinence: No significant difference between groups at either time point.Quality of Life: No significant difference between groups at either time point. Medication Usage: At long-term follow-up, use of antidiarrheal medication more common in the J-pouch group (34 % of patients with J-pouch and 17 % of patients with W-pouch were taking lopera-mide, p < 0.05). 9 % of patients with J-pouch and 3 %of patients with a W-pouch were taking codeine phosphate (p = ns). Postoperative Complications and Pouchitis:3 episodes of postoperative pelvic sepsis in eachgroup, managed successfully with antibiotics and drainage (1 patient in W-group lost pouch due to a leak). Conservatively managed small-bowel ob-struction or ileus in 3 patients with J-pouch, 4 with a W-pouch. 2 wound infections requiring drainage in patients with a J-pouch, 1 patient with a W-pouchhad a pulmonary embolism. No statistical diffe-rence between the groups regarding these compli- cations. Long-term complications: 1 or more epi- sodes of pouchitis in 53 % of patients with J-pouchand 33 % of patients with W-pouch (p = ns).Author 's Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the W-pouch has lower daytime frequency in c o m p a r i s o nw i t ht h eJ - p o u c ha t1y e a r ,b u t ,i nr e -gard to all other functional assessment parameters,there are no differences between the groups and, reassuringly, no variation in quality of life at thisanalyzed). \"Of the 30 patients that were not followed up [...], 8 were successfully contacted but did not complete the questionnaire, 3 haddied, and the remaining 19 were not traceable \". Notes: Unclear, if groups were similar at baseline: 5 more men inJ-pouch group, no p-value stated. Only weight and age reported (no significant differences).

We conclude thatthis study compellingly demonstrates that the J-pouch is the present ideal pouch design, because it has been clearly shown to be easier to construct,while having minimal functional disadvantages,which are attenuated over time and which have no significant impact on the patient 's quality of life.

The resultsfor our primary efficacy outcomes in this review come froma single trial inpatients with active ulcera-tive colitis. The findings of this study need to be inter- preted with caution as theyare based on a small num-ber of patients and the overall quality of the evi- dence was low. We do nothave enough evidence to determine whether hel- minths are safe when usedin patients with ulcerativecolitis and Crohn 'sd i s e a s e . Further randomised con- trolled trials are needed toassess the efficacy andsafety of T. suis ova therapy in ulcerative colitis and Crohn 's disease. Trials should be adequately powered and should inclu- de clinically relevant outco-mes including mucosal he-aling. These studies should investigate different doses and duration of T.suis treat-ment. From the study onulcerative colitis patients, and based on the clinical improvement rates achie-ved in the placebo group at12 weeks, we estimate that at least 91 participants perwithdrew before study comple- tion.

The risk of bias was high for all studies (especially for selectionbias, performance and detectionbias and reporting bias). None of the studies applied blinding of the patients or investigatorsusing any sham procedures, buta few tried blinded outcome assessment. On average, 27 % of the treatedpatients, and 29 % of the controlpatients dropped out or were lost to follow up (RR: 0.98; 95 % CI 0.92 to 1.05).Results based on HRQL suggest small study bias.

Many within-group effects were obser- ved and given the paucity of high-quality studies, thesewithin group observations merit further exploration in adequately powered andcontrolled clinical trials.Future studies should consider measurement of physiological outcomes tofurther elucidate fiber 's mechanism of action, ta- king into account the pos- sible confounding effect ofmedication. It is recom-mended that in patients with IBD without overt risk of obstruction, the restric-tion of dietary fiber is unne- cessary, but all patients should be appropriatelymonitored regarding theirtolerance to fiber intake.tailed in Data, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links. lww.com/IBD/A354.

Author 's Conclusion: In IBD, treatment goals are usually directed towards the management of di-gestive and systemic symptoms. Outcome and follow-up measures are typically based on clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and endoscopicand histological features. However, since these ob-jective measures may not necessarily correspond with patients 'subjective experience of illness and health outcomes, current trends point towards im-proving general well-being and to reducing the dis- ease associated concerns. This study suggests that medical treatment plus yoga intervention is moreeffective than medical treatment alone in reducingthe anxiety in patients with UC.Funding Sources: Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopa- thy (CCRYN), New Delhi, India.COI: The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Randomization: \"Randomisation was carried out in concealed alloca- tion on a computer-generated se- quence in a double-blind manner inblocks of four patients using 1:1allocation to the two treatment groups. Only complete blocks of ran- dom numbers were used foreach centre. If patients were eligiblefor study entry, they were assigned to random numbers ( = treatment numbers) in ascending order withineach centre according to the chro- nological order of their randomisa- tion and were given the cor-responding study medication. \" Blinding: Double blind study. Dropout Rate/ITT-Analysis: \"All analyses and the subgroup analy-ses, except for the passage 'per protocol ', were performed in the ITT population. \"One participant who was randomized was not inclu-ded in the ITT analysis, because hewas only treatment compliant for 7 days.

The American journal of gastroenterology. 108. 90 -98. 2013 Population Intervention Outcomes/Results Methodical type: Multicenter, rando- mized, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 52 centers in 5 countries (USA, Germany, Romania, Ukraine,Canada).Number of Patient: 224. years; confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Patients had a Mayo Score of 4 -10 points and mildly to moderately active dis-ease on sigmoidoscopy (endos- copic subscore of at least 1) equivalent medications sulfa- salazine, balsala zide, and or nomedical therapy.Exclusion Criteria: Patients with Crohn 's disease or indeterminate colitis, severe ulcerative colitis(Mayo Score of 11 or 12 points,toxic mega- colon, toxic colitis), previous colonic surgery or pro- bable requirement for intestinals u r g e r yw i t h i n1 2w e e k s ,e n t e r i c infec- tion within 2 weeks, a his- tory of tuberculosis, a positivechest X-ray or tuberculin protein-purified derivative skin test, ac- tive infection with hepatitis B or any infection with hepatitis C, in-fection with human immunodefi-ciency virus, cancer within 5 ye- ars, inadequate bone marrow, hepatic, or renal function, a his-tory of alcohol or drug abuse that would interfere with the study, significant concurrent medicaldiseases, allergy to plants in theAcanthacea family, and women who were pregnant or breast- feeding were not eligible. Patientsreceiving oral or rectal steroidsw i t h i n1m o n t h ,r e c t a lm e s a l a - mine within 1 week, antibiotics within 2 weeks, or azathioprine,6- mercaptopurine, anti- tumornecrosis factor agents, or im- muno-suppressive therapy within 6 weeks were also excluded.Intervention: Oral capsules containing Andrographis pani-culata ethanol ex- tract (HMPL-004; Hutchison MediPhar-ma Ltd., Shanghai,China) at doses of 1200 mg or 1800 mg for 8 weeks in threedivided doses. Oralmesalamine was continued at a stable dose.Comparison: Pla- cebo, administered in three divided doses. Patients weretreated for 8 weeks and followed through week 12.Oral mesalamine wascontinued at a stable dose.Primary: Clinical response at week 8 . A col onoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed and the Mayo Score was determined at weeks 0 and 8.Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the total Mayo Score by at least 3 points and at least 30 % with an accompanying decrease inrectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or aabsolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1 point) Secondary: clinical remission at week 8, Mucosal healing at week 8, time to partial Mayo Score response(defined as the time point at weeks 2, 4, 6, or 8 atwhich there was a decrease from baseline in the partial Mayo Score by at least 2 points); change from baseline in the partial Mayo Score at weeks 2, 4, 6, or 8;and the mean change from baseline in the total MayoScore at week 8 ; Safety assessments on adverse events were conducted through week 12. Clinical remission was defined as a total Mayo Score of 2 points or lo-wer, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point (12,13). Mucosal healing was defined as a decrease from baseline in the endoscopy subscore by at least1 point and an absolute endoscopy subscore of 0 or1 point. Adverse events and concomitant medica- tions were followed through week 12. Results: Primary: Clinical response: 45 and 60 % of patients receiving A. paniculata 1200 mg and1800 mg daily, respectively, were in clinical respon- se at week 8, compared with 40 % of those who received placebo (P = 0.5924 for 1200 mg vs.placebo and P = 0.0183 for 1800 mg vs. placebo). Secondary: Clinical remission : 34 and 38 % of pa- tients receiving A. paniculata 1200 mg and1800 mg daily, respectively, were in clinical remis-sion at week 8, compared with 25 % of those who received placebo (P = 0.2582 for 1200 mg vs. placebo and P = 0.1011 for 1800 mg vs. placebo).Adverse events: developed in 60 and 53 % of patients in the A. paniculata 1200 mg and 1800 mg daily groups, respectively, and 60 % in the placebo group.Author 's Conclusion: Patients with mildly to mo- derately active ulcerative colitis treated with A. paniculata extract (HMPL-004) at a dose of1800 mg daily were more likely to achieve clinicalresponse than those receiving placebo.Funding Sources: This work was supported by a research grant from Hutchison Medipharma Ltd.,Shanghai, China.

Primary outcome Efficacy: Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the totalMayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30 %,with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 point or absolute sub- score for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1.Secondary: Secondary outcome :Efficacy: Clinical remission was defined as a total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore excee- ding 1 point.Efficacy: Mucosal healing was defined as absolute subscore for endoscopy of 0 or 1. Safety outcomes: are not described in the methods; results section lists the incidence of adverse events.Results: Primary: Efficacy Clinical response: At the 8th week, 72.50 % of patients in FCC group (170 of 234) and 65.00 % of patients in HD group(52 of 80)had achieved a clinical response with no statisticallysignificant difference (P> 0.05). Efficacy Clinical remission The proportions of patients who had a clinical remission was similar(41.50 % in FCC group, 41.25 % in HD group, P> 0.05) Efficacy Mucosal healing: The rate at week 8 in the two groups was similar and also without significantdifference (55.13 % in FCC group, 55.00 % in HD group, P> 0.05). Mayo scores at week 8 showed no statistically significant difference between the twogroupsSafety: No significant differences were observed between the safety profiles of the 2 groups (P> 0.05). No severe AEs were reported in eithergroup. The latent class analysis indicated that FCCwas superior applicable for the left hemicolon involved patients than HD.

Potentialparticipants were approachedeither by letter or in person when attending clinic appointments. This was an exploratory study, asrecommended by the Medical Research Council guidelines.Intervention: Parti- cipants who wereassigned to the inter-vention dietary gui- delines DMF in UC form of an booklet 'Diet and Ulcerative Colitis ' (originally sponsoredby an educational grant from Procter & Gamble Pharmaceu-ticals). This bookletwas developed and published in 2007 with an aim to trans-late research-baseddietary knowledge into practical dietary guidelines. The boo-klet is now freely dis- tributed by NHS tients in for a Healthy Leicester- shire 'and assigned to follow their usual diet.

Results: Overall, 112 patients completed the study. Study participants were asked to completethe IBDQ and SCCAI together with the Food Fre- quency Questionnaire at 0, 6 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, there was a mean reduction in the SimpleClinical Colitis Activity Index score in the interven-tion group compared with an increase in the score in the control group [ 1.304 (P = 0.0108) vs. 0.875 (P = 0.0249)].There was a mean increase in the IBDQ score in theintervention group compared with a reduction in the score in the control group [7.17 (P = 0.126) vs. 3.44 (P = 0.205)]. A total of 69 % of patients in theintervention group found the dietary advice signifi-cantly or moderately helpful. Author 's Conclusion: The study suggests that there is likely to be a link between the dietary advi-ce provided and symptomatic improvement. The effect of diet may not occur through the addition or the elimination of single nutrients; rather, eachfood consumed combines many nutrients thatallow for a synergistic or an antagonistic action when present in a certain composition.Funding Sources: This study was funded by an educational grantfrom Warner Chilcott UK Ltdthrough the charity GEAR (Gastrointestinal Education And Research).COI: There are no conflicts of randomization scheduleproduced by SPSS 18.0 (IBM, Chica- go, Illinois, USA) was used to assign each patient to an intervention or acontrol arm.Blinding: No blinding Dropout Rate/ITT- Analysis: There were 10 and 8 dropouts out of 71and 59 for Intervention and Controlgroups.

Mucosal healing was scored using the CGA colonoscopy paradigm and histopathology was scored using the CGA his-topathological paradigm. Colonoscopy scores at baseline were compared with those obtained at the completion of the 8-week study. There were twoprimary efficacy endpoints, both based on theclinical response. The 'general evaluation 'was cal- culated by the percentage of the reduction of sum scores after completion of study treatment com-pared with the sum scores at the baseline. The'clinical evaluation 'was judged by the percentage of patients attaining remission, partial remission, or improvement at week 8. Remission meant allsymptoms disappeared, partial remission meant reduction of 50 % of symptoms, and improvement m e a n tm o r et h a n2 5%r e d u c t i o ni ns y m p t o m s .Secondary: Secondary endpoints were based on colonoscopy find ings. The first was the percentage of patients showing remission (no inflammation), partial remission (inflammation reduced by twogrades) or improvement (inflammation reduced byone grade) in the mucosal appearance, and the se- cond was the percentage of patients who showed histological improvement on biopsy.Results: Clinical remission and response were seen in 21 % and 76 % of HMPL-004-treated patients, and 16 % and 82 % of mesalazine-treated patients. By colonoscopy, remission and response were seen in28 % and 74 % of HMPL-004-treated patients and 24 % and 71 % of mesalazine-treated patients, respectively.
