Schrader , Secr etary Laboratories Administration Robert A. Myers, Ph.D., Director 1770 Ashland Avenue Baltimore, Maryland 21205 February 24, 202 2 Dear Health Professionals: This reference guide lists public health laboratory services available to health officers, physicians, and other health prof essionals to assist in the prevention, diagnosis, and control of human diseases. The listing of laboratory services is arranged alphabeti cally by test and includes contact information for the laboratory that performs the test. Specimens and samples submit ted to the central and regional laboratories should be collected and submitted in special kits provided by the Laboratories Administration. These kits may also be obtained from the regional laboratories or county health departme nts. Use of these kits ass ures collection of the proper type of specimen, preservation of specimen integrity, proper demographic/epidemiological information, and prompt distribution for examination when received in the laboratory. Records of patient information and test results are treated as confidential information and will be released only to the submitting physician or other legally authorized individual. Public Health professionals and physicians using the Administration's services are invited to visit the central laboratory in Baltimore or their regional laboratory. A few minutes spent in the laboratory can often result in clarification of points regarding ty pes of tests performed, specimen kits available, and many other points' important to effective use of laboratory services . This personal contact not only improves services but also can be informative to the physician and stimulating to the laboratorian in supporting the pra ctice of modern scientific medicine.

COURIER SERVICE The Laboratories Administration contracts to provide specimen courier service for many local health departments. Pr oblems concerning the courier service should be reported immediately by calling 4 43-681-3820 . A.4. SPECIMEN REJECTION POLICY The Laboratories Administration's \"Specimen/Sample Acceptance and Rejection Criteria\" policy helps to assure the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of laboratory test results by eliminating the testing of unacceptable specimens. When the laborat ory determines that a specimen is unacceptable for testing, the laboratory, whenever feasible, notif ies the submitter immediately by telephone, confirms the notification in writing, and temporarily retains the specimen for possible future testing (e.g., in c ases where additional information provided by the submitter would make the specimen acceptable for testing). A.5. BILLING Questions concerning client billing, laboratory billing, and laboratory reimbursement by the Maryland Medical Assistance Prog ram or other third party payer should be directed to the Head of the Laboratory Administration's Billing Unit by telephoning 4 43-681- 3810. B. SPECIMEN SUPPLIES, PACKAGING, TRANSPORT, AND DELIVERY B.1. PACKAGING FOR TRANSPORT: Care must be taken to ensure a proper transport environment for specimens. Collect recommended quantities of test specimen and follo w all directions for recording date and, where appropriate, time of specimen collection. Also make every effort to see that specimens are transported at required temperatures and in appropriate collection containers. Collection containers and other specime n supplies are available from the Laboratory's Supply Unit (4 43-681-3777 ). In addition, always separate glass tubes by using either protective material or separate biohazard bags to prevent breakage and cross -contamination during transport (se e Basic Triple Packaging on page 10). A submitter using a courier service should take similar precautions by submitting individual tubes and requisition slips in separate, sealable plastic biohazard bags protected in an appropriate shipping container. TEST COLLECTION COMPONENTS AND OTHER LABORATORY SUPPLIES: The Laboratories Administration provides test request forms and specimen collection components (e.g., tubes, bags, etc.). Questions about supplies should be directed to the nearest Regional Laboratory or the Central Laboratory Supplies Unit at 443-681-3777 or email mdhlabs.outfits@maryland.gov .

For newborn screening collection cards visit our website: https://health.maryland.gov/laboratories/Pa ges/Newborn - Screening.aspx . Note that various tests and specimens require different types of collection devices, transport media, and transport container s. Using the incorrect kit, collection component, or container will often render a test specimen unacceptable for analysis. If you have a question regarding the acceptable collection container contact the testing laboratory. MD Department of Health -Laboratories Administration The J. Meh sen Joseph Public Health Laboratory Guide to Public Health Laboratory Services Page 9 of 142 February 2022 edition v2.0.12 B.1.a. VIA STATE CONTRACTED COURI ER Counties using the state contracted courier service must pack specimens and/or samples according to the temperature storage requirements. Specimens requiring freezing should be frozen and packed with adequate cooling (dry ice) material to maintain their proper temperature for up to 36 hours. Coolers are required to transport all specim ens and/or samples through the s tate contracted courier. Therefore , it is essential that all coolers be properly labeled. Each cooler should specify the conditions for storage on all visible outer surfaces - \"ROOM TEMPERATURE\", \"REFRIGERATE\", or \"FREEZE\". Each cooler for specific laboratories should be labeled on all visible outer surfaces for \"ENVIRONMENTAL\" or \"RABIES\". Both Environmental and Rabies coolers must only be u sed as labeled. DO NOT use or re -use Environmental or Rabies coolers for any other types of specimens/samples, or add any other types of specimens to these coolers. A \"RABIES\" cooler must only be used for rabies samples, and an \"ENVIRONMENTAL\" cooler must only be used for environmental specimens. Specimens/samples that are received in an Environmental or Rabies cooler that are not intended for Environmental or Rabies testing will be rejected and discarded for s afety reasons. (Pleas e see Rabies Section on page 15 for detailed information on animal rabies submissions). B. 1. b. VIA U.S. MAIL OR OTHER CARRIER: Due to regulation s published by IATA (International Air Transportation Association), US DOT (Unit ed States Department of Transportation), and the USPS (United States Postal Service), the Laboratories Administration's specimen collection component s may be used only when sending specimens via private or state-contracted courier. These containers are not approved or certified for use in the USPS system or other common carriers (e.g., FedEx , UPS, etc.). Infectious substances sent through the mail or by other common carrier s must be packaged by individuals trained and certified in Infectious Substances ship ping . Certified packaging systems are not supplied by the Laboratories Administration. Before using the USPS or other carrier, the shipper must refer to the current IATA, USPS and DOT r egulations. IATA has divided infectious substances into two categories. IATA \"Category A Infectious Substance\" includes substances that are \"transported i n a form that, when exposure to it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life -threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals.\" \"Category A Infectious Substances\" are subject to the more stringent packing requirements described in IATA Packing Instruction 602. An IATA \"Category B Infectious Substance\" is defined as \"an infectious sub stance that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in Category A.\" The proper shipping name of UN 3373 is Biological s ubstance Category B. This includes human or animal material transported for research, diagnosis, disease treatment, etc., and diagnostic or clinical cultures. These specimens must be mailed and transported in packaging that meets IATA Packing Instruction 650. BASIC TRIPLE PACKAGING (Refer to tests for specific details) Basic triple packaging systems include a primary receptacle such as a tube with adhesive tape around the screw cap or a plate with parafilm around the edges. The primary (1\u00b0) receptacle, along with required absorbent and cushioning material, is placed inside a secondary (2\u00b0) container. The 2\u00b0 container for diagnostic spec imens should be a sealed biohazard or Ziploc bag . The 2\u00b0 container is then securely placed within an outer shipping container ( tertiary ( 3\u00b0) container), generally a corrugated cardboard box with cushioning material inside to surround the 2\u00b0 container. This outermost container bears the name, address, and telephone number of shipper, name of person responsible with 24/7 telephone number, and the complete name, shipping address, and telephone number of the recipient, plus all the required markings. Include an itemized list of contents in a sealed plastic bag, placed between the 3\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 containers. Specific instructions for various tests can be found in the test list section of th is guide. MD Department of Health -Laboratories Administration The J. Meh sen Joseph Public Health Laboratory Guide to Public Health Laboratory Services Page 10 of 142 February 2022 edition v2.0.12 Example of a correctly prepared and labeled triple package for Biological specimen, Category B (UN 3373) (previously known as Clinical specimen and Diagnostic Specimen . A Category B infectious substance is one that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in Category A. A Category B inf ectious substance does not cause permanent disability or life -threatening or fatal disease to humans or animals when exposure to it occurs. The proper shipping name for a Category B infectious substance, \"Biological specimen, Category B,\" is assigned to id entication number shipping names \"Diagnostic specimen\" and \"Clinical specimen\" may no longer be used (as of January 1, 2007). (Modified from Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories [BMBL], 5th edition) BASIC TRIPLE PACKAGING: 1) A watertight primary receptacle. 2) A watertight secondary receptacle. 3) An outer packaging of adequate strength for its capacity, mass and intended use. Note: For a liquid specimen, absorbent material must be placed between the primar y and secondary containers and be capable of absorbing the entire contents of the primary receptacle(s). Certified packaging systems are designed to withstand specific pressure changes and drop tests. Packaging systems that meet t he packing instruction s tandards are currently available from vendors specializing in products certified to meet the IATA, USPS, and other carriers' requirements. Packaging systems using fiberboard or aluminum canisters, zip -lock bags, or other uncertified components may not be i n compliance. IT IS THE RESPONSIBI LITY OF THE SHIPPER TO COMPLY WITH ALL L AWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING THE SHIPPI NG OF INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCE S. Questions may be referred to the MD Department of Health Laboratories Administration's Quality Assurance Officer, Heather Peters , by calling or by email .

MD Department of Health -Laboratories Administration The J. Meh sen Joseph Public Health Laboratory Guide to Public Health Laboratory Services Page 12 of 142 February 2022 edition v2.0.12 C. SPECIMEN COLLECTION, PREPARATION, AND HANDLING C.1. GENERAL Specimen quality is a product of the nature of the specimen itself, how well it was collected, and the manner in which it is or was transported to the laboratory. A laboratory can provide accurate and clinically relevant test results only if it receives go od test specimens. Before attempting to collect a specimen, look up the desired test(s) in this reference guide. Check to see if ther e are specific requirements for: 1. Specimen type or volume; 2. Collecting procedures; 3. Collecting devices or containe rs. Use the correct test request form and properly and legibly complete this form to ensure accurate and efficient laboratory ser vice. Use a soft pencil or black ballpoint to print the information. Be sure to include proper identifying information on the test request form and the specimen itself. Please note the clinic's full mailing address , test request authorized by personnel, and telephone number to assure proper return of test results. Then see that the test request form accompanies the specimen. The following sections provide practical guidelines to physicians, nurses, and other non -laboratory health personnel who must routinely collect and submit clinical specimens to one of the State's pub lic health laboratories (i.e., MD Department of Health Labor atories Administration). C.1.a. PATIENT PREPARATION Prior to the time scheduled to collect a patient's specimen the patient should receive appropriate instructions concerning fa sting, diet, and medication restriction. For example, a patient about to subm it a specimen for a microbiology culture should have specimen(s) collected before starting antimicrobial therapy. C.1.b. SPECIMEN HANDLING BY SUBMITTER The most common specimen handling errors include failing to: 1. Tighten specimen container lids or caps; 2. Label a specimen correctly; and 3. Provide all pertinent clinical information. Properly identifying specimens is extremely important. Legibly label each specimen container or tube with the patient's full name, and date of specimen collection, just as they appear on the test request form. Information on specimens should be checked against information on the test request form for agreement before the specimen is sent to the laboratory. MD Department of Health -Laboratories Administration The J. Meh sen Joseph Public Health Laboratory Guide to Public Health Laboratory Services Page 13 of 142 February 2022 edition v2.0.12 C.2. PROCUREMENT AND SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS, PRECAUTIONS, AND PROBLEMS BY SPECIMEN TYPE C.2.a. BLOOD/SERUM C.2.a.(1.) HEMOLYSIS In general, grossly or even moderately hemolyzed blood specimens may not be acceptable for testing. Hemolyzed serum is pink o r red, rather than the normal clear straw color. Most cases of hemolysis can be avoided by observing the steps below. 1. Use a needle no smaller than 20 - or 21 - gauge. (On occasion, however, it may be necessary to use a 22 - or 23 - gauge needle for patients fr om elderly and pediatric populations with small or difficult veins.) Hemolysis can be avoided by not placing small gauge Butterfly needles into Vacutainer tubes. Carefully and safely remove Butterfly and replace with a 16 -gauge needle before penetrating Va cutainer tube. 2. If there is air leakage around the needle or loss of vacuum in the tube, replace the vacuum tube. 3. Collect blood in room temperature containers unless the specimen requirement specifies otherwise. 4. When a vacuum tube fills too slo wly due to an incomplete venipuncture, damage to the red blood cells may result. Correct by deeper vein entry or select another puncture site and collect a second specimen. 5. Do not remove the needle from the vein until the vacuum tube is completely filled or the tube is pulled back from holder to release pressure. Premature removal causes a rush of air to enter the tube, with resultant damage to the red cells. C.2.a.(2.) PAIRED SERA/PARALLEL TESTING Both acute and convalescent sera are required to determine recent infection. Acute sera may be tested immediately and then stored until the convalescent sera are submitted. When both sera are available parallel testing under identical testing conditions will be performed to ensure an accurate comparison of acute and convalescent antibody titers. See Submission of Specimen for requested serological test. MD Department of Health -Laboratories Administration The J. Meh sen Joseph Public Health Laboratory Guide to Public Health Laboratory Services Page 14 of 142 February 2022 edition v2.0.12 C.2.a.(3.) VACUUM TUBES CONTAINING ANTICOAGULANTS When using vacuum tub es containing anticoagulants and preservatives: 1. Tap the tube gently at a point just below the stopper to release any additive adhering to the tube or stopper. 2. Permit the tube to fill completely to ensure the proper ratio of blood to additive. 3. To ensure adequate mixing of blood with the anticoagulant or preservative, use a slow rolling wrist motion to invert the tube gently five or six times. Rapid wrist motion or vigorous shaking contributes either to small clot formation or hemolysis and fai ls to initiate proper mixing action. 4. Check to see that all the preservative or anticoagulant is dissolved. If any preservative powder is visible, continue inverting the tube slowly until the powder is dissolved. C.2.a.(4.) VACUUM TUBES WITHOUT ANTICOAGULANTS When using vacuum tubes containing no anticoagulants or preservatives, or SST serum Separator Tubes: 1. Permit the tube to fill completely. 2. Let the specimen stand for a minimum of 30 minutes and not long er than 45 minutes prior to centrifugation. This allows time for the clot to form. If the specimen is allowed to stand longer than 45 minutes, chemical activity and degeneration of the cells within the tube will take place, and test results will be alte red as a consequence. 3. Centrifuge the specimen at the end of the 30 to 45 minute period in strict accordance with man ufacturer's instructions for speed and duration of centrifugation. C.2.a.(5.) QUANTITY NOT SUFFICIENT (QNS) One of the most common errors in specimen collection is the submission of an insufficient quantity of specimen for testing. To ensure an adequate amount of specimen: 1. Always draw whole blood in an amount 2 \u00bd times the required volume of serum needed for a particular test. Fo r example, if 4mL serum are required, draw at least 10mL whole blood. 2. For most profile testing submit one full tube of serum (8 -10mL). C.2.b. ENTOMOLOGICAL SPECIMENS Identification of insects and other ectoparasites of medical importance (e.g., ticks , bed bugs, etc. ) can be provided as a referral service. Please call the Microbiology Division ( 443-681-3943/443 -681-3952 ) prior to submitting insect specimens. MD Department of Health -Laboratories Administration The J. Meh sen Joseph Public Health Laboratory Guide to Public Health Laboratory Services Page 15 of 142 February 2022 edition v2.0.12 C.2.c. RABIES SPECIMENS C.2.c.(1.) HOURS OF OPERATION The MD Department of Health Laboratories Administration Rabies Laboratory operates from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM weekdays (Monday through Friday except on holidays . On-call laboratory scientists are available for requests that require test results as soon as possible so that a medical det ermination on rabies post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can be made. Specimens must be received at the MD Department of Health Laboratories Administration by 12:00 PM on Fridays to have the test results reported by Friday 4:30 PM. Specimens received on Friday s after 12:00 PM will have the results ready the next regular workday. Specimens received on evenings from Monday through Friday, Fridays from 12:00 PM to 4:30 PM, on a weekend, or on a State holiday will be processed on the next regular workday, except fo r situations that require test results as soon as possible so that a medical determination about rabies PEP can be made (emergency examination). In these situations, prior approval by epidemiology staff in the MD Department of Health Office of Infectious D isease Epidemiology and Outbreak Response (IDEOR) is necessary before testing will be initiated by on -call laboratory scientists. (For details, please see the Emergency Examination Requests section below). C.2.c.(2.) DELIVERY PROCEDURES Delivery of specime ns must be from Monday through Friday 7:30AM to 6:00PM (regular workdays) to the MD Department of Health Laboratories Administration Loading Dock at 1770 Ashland Ave Baltimore, Maryland 21205. All animal submission of specimen must be routed through the l ocal health department and sent via courier service . Do not use the U.S. Postal Service or other public transportation service to send specimens. (For emergency examination situations, please see the Emergency Examination Requests section below). C.2.c.(3.) ORDERING TESTS For routine testing Monday through Friday, all local health departments must use the MD Department of Health Laboratories Administration's MyLIMS (Laboratory Information Management Systems ) https://starlims3.health.maryland.gov/starlims11.MDlabs.prod/ for submission of specimens. The updated rabies submission form (DHMH 1188 08/17) will print out automati cally when the animal rabies test is ordered through the MyLIMS system, and must be included in the cooler and attached to the specimen being submitted. One Rabies Submission Form should accompany each animal submitted. Specimens approved for emergency tes ting must be accompanied by a fully completed handwritten Rabies Submission Form if access to MyLIMS is not possible. An emergency contact name and phone number must be listed on the Rabies Submission Form. The updated rabies submission form (DHMH 1188 08/17) can be downloaded from our website at. https://health.maryland.gov/laboratories/Pages/Rabies.aspx C.2.c.(4.) CRITERIA FOR ANIMAL SUBMISSION Live animals will NOT be accepted in the laboratory. Terrestrial animals acceptable for submission to the MD Department of Health are rabies vector species (e.g., raccoons, foxes, skunks, etc.) that expose humans, livestock, or pets. Exposure is defined a s a bite that breaks the skin or contact of mucous membranes or broken skin with either animal saliva or nervous tissue. Birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians will not be accepted for rabies testing under any circumstances. Small rodents, including squirrels, chipmunks, gerbils , guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, mice, rats, voles, shrews and moles, will not be accepted for testing unless (1) the animal has bitten a human and (2) prior approval for testing has been authorized by the MD Department of Health IDEOR epidemiology staff. Most recent human cases of rabies in the U.S. have been associated with bats, and bat bites may be difficult to recognize . Bats should be submitted for testing in all cases of direct human contact with a bat or when bite or mucous membrane contact cannot be ruled out. Live animals will NOT be accepted in the laboratory. Please Note: Large animal heads (e.g. horse and cow) should be submitted to the Maryland Department of Agriculture for brain tissue extraction. MD Department of Health -Laboratories Administration The J. Meh sen Joseph Public Health Laboratory Guide to Public Health Laboratory Services Page 16 of 142 February 2022 edition v2.0.12 C.2.c.(5.) EMERGENCY EXAMINATION REQUESTS Some situations that occur after regular business hours may require rabies test results as soon as possible so that a medical determination about rabies PEP can be made. In these Situations, on -call laboratory scientists are available; and specimens may be examined Fridays from 12:00 PM to 4:30 PM, on a weekend, or on a State holiday, w ith prior approval of the MD Department of Health PHPA (Prevention and Health Promotion Administration) epidemiology staff. To reach the epidemiology staff during regular bus iness hours, contact the MD Department of Health PHPA for Zoonotic and Vector -borne -767- 5649 (main); 410 -767-6703 (MD Department of Health State Public Health Veterinarian) ; or 410 -767-6618 (CZV BD) Rabies Chief).

SPECIMEN COLLECTION Live animals will NOT be accepted in the laboratory. Animals should be euthanized in a manner that will not destroy the brain tissues to be examined in the diagnosis of rabies. When possible, only the animal's head should be submitted for diagnostic purposes. For animals wei ghing more than 20 pounds, particularly large dogs, only the head may be submitted for testing. If an animal is being submitted to MD Department of Health Labs from an animal pathology or diagnostic laboratory, and the animal has already been prepared for necropsy, the submitter should submit all or a cross section of the brainstem and half of the cerebrum. Please Note: Large animal heads (e.g. horse and cow) should be submitted to the Maryland Department of Agriculture for brain tissue extraction. C.2.c.(7.) PACKAGING AND SHIPPING All rabies specimens must be placed into coolers that are clearly marked as rabies coolers. No other non -rabies clinical samples may be placed into rabies coolers or these samples will be rejected. Rabies coolers must fu lly close and must be waterproof. Each specimen must be individually packaged in a leak -proof bag and clearly labeled. Each specimen must be accompanied by a Rabies Submission Form for proper identification. All Rabies Submission Forms must be filled ou t correctly and legibly including exposure type. Coolers may be shipped with ice or ice packs but the ice should not occupy more than 1/3 of the cooler.

ABCs is an active laboratory and population -based surveillance system for invasive bacterial pathogens of public health importance. For each case of invasive disease in the surveillance population, a case report with basic demographic information is compl eted and bacterial isolates are sent to CDC and other reference laboratories for additional laboratory evaluation. ABCs was initially established in four (4) states in 1995. It currently operates among ten (10) EIP sites across the United States, represe nting a population of over 38 million persons. At this time, ABCs conducts surveillance for six (6) pathogens: Group A and Group B M D Department of Health is an EIP site with partner Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Indicates no detectable antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi. A negative result does not exclude a Lyme disease infection. Patients with early stages of infection or who have undergone antibiotic therapy may not produce measurab le IgG/IgM antibodies. Additional specimens should be submitted in 2 -4 weeks if Borrelia burgdorferi exposure has not been ruled out. REACTIVE . Antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi have been detected. Sera from individuals with other pathogenic spirochetal diseases, bacterial and viral infections, and individuals with connective tissue autoimmune diseases or anti-nuclear antibody may also have antibodies which cross -react with B. burgdorferi. EQUIVOCAL \u2014Immunological status cannot be determined, please re -draw patient in 2 -4 weeks Additional Information: http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/ Purpose of Test: \u2014Chemiluminescent Immunoassay, Western Blot Comment: Your health care provider has ordered a laboratory test for the presence of Lyme Disease for you. Current Laboratory testing for Lyme Disease can be problematic and standard laboratory tests often result in false negative and false positive result s, and if done too early, you may not have produced enough antibodies to be considered positive because your immune response requires time to develop antibodies. If you are tested for Lyme Disease and the results are negative, this does not necessarily mea n you do not have Lyme Disease. If you continue to experience unexplained symptoms, you should contact your health care provider and inquire about the appropriateness of retesting or initial or additional treatment. The Western blot test will be used to confirm the presence of B. burgdorferi specific antibodies detected by the CLIA screening test on all Positive & Equivocal specimens.

Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens : colony count of > 100,000 CFU/ml is considered significant. Reference Range: (Staph aureus : Bacillus cereus : Clostridium perfringens ) found after 48 hours incubation. Additional Information: Bacillus cereus : The symptoms of B. cereus diarrheal type food poisoning mimic those of Clostridium perfringens food poisoning. The onset of watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and pain occurs 6 -15 hours after consumption of contaminated food. Nausea may accompany diarrhea, but vomiting (emesis) rar ely occurs. Symptoms persist for 24 hours in most instances. The emetic type of food poisoning is characterized by nausea and vomiting within 0.5 to 6 hours after consumption of contaminated foods. Occasionally, abdominal cramps and/or diarrhea may also occur. Duration of symptoms is generally less than 24 hours. Clostridium perfringens: The common form of C. perfringens poisoning is characterized by intense abdominal cramps and diarrhea which begin 8 -22 hours after consumption of foods containing lar ge numbers of those C. perfringens bacteria capable of producing the food poisoning toxin. The illness is usually over within 24 hours but less severe symptoms may persist in some individuals for 1 or 2 weeks. Staph. aureus: The onset of symptoms in stap hylococcal food poisoning is usually rapid and in many cases acute, depending on individual susceptibility to the toxin, the amount of contaminated food eaten, the amount of toxin in the food ingested, and the general health of the victim. The most common symptoms are nausea, vomiting, retching, abdominal cramping, and prostration. Some individuals may not always demonstrate all the symptoms associated with the illness. In more severe cases, headache, muscle cramping, and transient changes in blood press ure and pulse rate may occur. Recovery generally takes two (2) days; however, it is not unusual for complete recovery to take three (3) days and sometimes longer in severe cases. Purpose of Test: To detect the presence of bacteria that may be agents of food poisoning, since the presence of any amount of Staph aureus or the presence of large amounts (greater than 100,000 CFU/ml) of Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens is consistent with a pote ntial hazard to health.

Antibiotic susceptibilities reported. Reference Range: No Neisseria gonorrhea isolated Additional Information: Store unused plates under refrigeration upside down (media facing down). Discard any plate(s) with an expired expiration date or that exhibit growth prior to use (never use contaminated plates). Always allow plates to w arm to room temperature before using (cold kills Neisseria gonorrhea ). Use Dacron tipped swabs with plastic shafts (do not use cotton -tipped swabs, as they may contain fatty acids that can interfere with the survival of some organisms. Also do not use ca lcium alginate -tipped swabs. They can be toxic for some strains of N. gonorrhoeae .) Always allow the surface of plates to dry before using (a wet surface hampers isolated colony formation). DO NOT CRUSH OR ADD WATER TO THE CO 2 GENERATING TABLET (CAUSES LOSS OF CO 2 AND POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION BY WATER.) MOISTURE FROM THE MEDIUM WILL ACTIVATE THE CO 2 TABLET. Do not incubate inoculated plates in the clinic longer than 24 hours (over -incubation leads to more growth of contaminating normal flora). If incuba ted, indicate the number of hours on the test request form. If an incubator is not available, invert the inoculated plates and hold them at room temperature until picked up by the courier.

Meh sen Joseph Public Health Laboratory Guide to Public Health Laboratory Services Page 69 of 142 February 2022 edition v2.0.12 Results and Interpretation: Assay results should be interpreted only in the context of oth er clinical laboratory findings and the total clinical status of the individual. It has b een shown that a viremic window exists with individuals infected with HAV, where the individual may be symptomatic for hepatitis but IgM anti -HAV nonreactive. Negative : IgM anti -HAV not detected. Does not exclude th e possibility of ex posure to or infection with HAV. Levels of IgM anti -HAV may be below the cut -off in early infection. Equivocal/Gray zone : HAV IgM antibody may or may not be present. Patients exhibiting gray zone test results should be closely monit ored by redrawing and rete sting approximately one week intervals. Monitoring the level of IgM anti -HAV by redrawing and retesting at approximately one week intervals will distinguish rapidly rising IgM anti -HAV levels associated with early acute hepatitis A infecti on from gradually decreasing or unchanging IgM anti -HAV levels often associated with late acute stage of HAV infection. Positive : HAV IgM antibody detected. Presumptive evidence of HAV infection. A reactive IgM anti -HAV result does not rule out other hepatitis infections. Additional Information: For more information, see the CDC link at: http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/index.htm Purpose of Test: HAVAB -M assay is for the qualitative detection of IgM antibody to hepatitis A virus (IgM anti-HAV) in human serum or plasma. IgM anti -HAV is indicated for testing of specimens from individuals who have signs and symptoms consistent with acute hepatitis. Test results are used in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or recent hepatitis A viral infection. During the acute phase of HAV infection, IgM anti -HAV appears in the patient's serum and is nearly always detectable at the onset of symptoms. In most cases, Ig M anti -HAV response peaks within the first month of illness and can persist for up to six months. It is not intended for use in screening blood, plasma, or tissue donors. Method: Chemiluminescent micro particle immunoassay (CMIA) Interfering Substances: Human anti -mouse antibodies (HAMA), found in patients who have received mouse monoclonal antibody treatments. Heterophilic antibodies in human serum, often found in patients routinely exposed to animals or animal serum products. Specimen with anti -E. coli, anti-CMV, or from hemodialysis patients.

Meh sen Joseph Public Health Laboratory Guide to Public Health Laboratory Services Page 74 of 142 February 2022 edition v2.0.12 Comment: May not detect a recent infection, or infection in a person with severely compromised immune system. Assay performance characteristics have not been established when the HBsAg Qualitative assay is used in conjunction with other manufacturers' assays for specific HBV markers. Current methods for the detectio n of hepatitis B surface antigen may not detect all potentially infected individuals. A nonreactive test result does not exclude the possibility of exposure to or infection with hepatitis B virus. A nonreactive test result in individuals with prior exposur e to hepatitis B may be due to antigen levels below the detection limit of this assay or lack of antigen reactivity to the antibodies in this assay. If the HBsAg Qualitative results are inconsistent with clinical evidence, additional testing is suggested t o confirm the result for diagnostic purposes. Results should be used in conjunction with patient history and other hepatitis markers for diagnosis of acute and chronic infection. A reactive HBsAg result does not exclude co -infection by another hepatitis v irus. TEST: Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Confirmation (HBsAg Positive Reflex Synonym: HBsAg plasma Specimen identification: The specimen/sample must be properly labeled and include patient's name or unique patient/sample identifier matching the test requisition or electronic test order. Specimen Volume ( Optimum): 5 ml. (Whole blood) or 4 ml. (Serum or Plasma) Specimen Volume (Minimum): 3 ml. (Whole blood) or 2 ml. (Serum or Collect: Serum - Lavender -top (EDTA) vacutainer Form: Test cannot be requested, it is a reflex test for HBsAg positive specimens. Packaging and Shipping*: Specimens must be packaged in a triple packaging system to ensure that under normal conditions of transport they cannot break, be punctured or leak their contents (Refer to pages 9 & 10 for triple packing guidance). *Refer to current Federal regulations for specific shipping requirements. Transport Conditions: Ambient temperature for specimens on the blood clot (whole blood specimens transported on ice packs are acceptable), separated serum at 28\u00b0C (refrigerated) or 20\u00b0C (frozen). Refrigerated specimen must be tested within 7 days of collection. Speci men Rejection Criteria: Discrepancy between name on tube and name on form, unlabeled specimen; hemolytic; gross bacterial contamination. Specimens collected > 7 days prior to submission Availability: Monday through Friday. Results and Interpretation: Confirmed: Presence of HBs Antigen confirmed. Confirmed result may indicate acute or chronic HBV infection, depending on presence of other HBV serological markers. Not Confirmed : The presence of HBsAg cannot be confirmed via neutralization. The repeatedly rea ctive result obtained with the HBsAg Qualitative assay may be the result of a nonspecific reaction (false positive). As the presence of nonspecific binding may obscure low levels of HBsAg in the specimen due to early infection or early recovery, it is reco mmended that the patient be evaluated for other serologic markers of HBV infection (i.e., total anti -HBc or IgM antiHBc) and that the patient be retested for HBsAg in 4 to 6 weeks. Additional Information: For more information, see the CDC link at: http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/index.htm Purpose of Test: The HBsAg Qualitative confirmation assay is for the qualitative confirmation of the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in human serum or plasma by specific antibody neutralization. Assay results, in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information, may be used to provide presumptive evidence of infection with HBV (state of infection or associated disease not determined ) in persons with signs and symptoms of hepatitis and in persons at risk for hepatitis B infection. It is not intended for use in screening blood, plasma, or tissue donors. Method: Chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) Interfering Substances: Human anti -mouse (HAMA), found in patients who have received mouse monoclonal antibody treatments.

Assay performance characterist ics have not been established when HBsAg Qualitative Confirmatory assay is used in conjunction with other manufacturers' assays for specific HBV serological markers. If HBsAg Qualitative Confirmatory results are Inconsistent with clinical evidence, additio nal testing is suggested to confirm the result. For diagnostic purposes, results should be used in conjunction with patient history and other hepatitis markers for diagnosis of acute and chronic infection. Although there is an association between the prese nce of HBsAg infectivity and a reactive result, it is recognized that presently available methods for HBsAg confirmation may not detect all possible cases of HBV infection.

For diagnostic purposes, results should be used in conjunction with patient history and other hepatitis markers for diagnosis of acute and chronic infection. Current methods for the detection of antibodies to HCV may not detect all infected indivi duals. A nonreactive test result does not exclude the possibility of exposure to HCV. Nonreactive test results in individuals with prior exposure to HCV may be due to antibody levels being below the detection limit of this assay or to lack of antibody reac tivity to the recombinant antigens used in this assay. Immunocompromised patients who have HCV may produce levels of antibody below the sensitivity of this assay and may not be detected as positive. The affinity or avidity differences of anti -human IgG/Ig M for anti -HCV have not been determined with this assay. Therefore, there may not be a demonstration of a significant increase in antibody level between acute and convalescent specimens for a patient in the late acute stage of infection when IgM antibodies are decreasing. Results obtained with Anti -HCV assay may not be used interchangeably with values obtained with different manufacturers' assay methods. Assay performance characteristics have not been established for newborns, infants, children, or popula tions of immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients.

Transport Conditions: Ambient temperature for specimens on the blood clot (whole blood specimens transported on ice packs are a cceptable), separated serum at 28\u00b0C (refrigerated) or 20\u00b0C (frozen). Refrigerated specimen must be tested within 7 days of collection. Specimen Rejection: Discrepancy between name on tube and name on form, unlabeled specimen; hemolytic; lipemic; gross b acterial contamination. Specimens collected > 7 days prior to submission. Availability: Service available only to state and local health departments Monday to Friday. Results and Interpretation: Negative: Indicates no detectable IgG antibody to Measl es virus. A negative result indicates no current or previous infection with Measles virus. Such individuals are presumed to be susceptible to primary infection. However, specimen taken too early during a primary infection may not have detectable levels o f IgG antibody. If primary infection is suspected, another specimen (convalescent) should be taken in 8 -14 days and tested concurrently in the same assay with the original (acute) specimen to look for seroconversion. If acute specimen is negative and conva lescent specimen is positive, seroconversion has taken place and a primary Measles virus infection is indicated. Equivocal: Equivocal results are indeterminate. Patient may or may not have immunity to Measles Virus. This result is not acceptable proof of immunity. Positive: Indicates evidence of Measles IgG antibodies. This suggests past or current infection with Measles virus, via acquired immunity or immunization and probable protection from clinical infection (immunity). Additional Information: For more information, see the CDC link at: https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html Purpose of Test: For detection of IgG antibodies to Measles virus. The test can be used to evaluate single sera for immune status. Method: Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA) Interfering Substances: Test results in immunocompromised patients should be interpreted with caution. Testing Site: MDH Laboratories Administration, Central Laboratory 1770 Ashland Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21205 Comment: A diagnosis should not be made on the basis of anti -Measles results alone. Test results should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical evaluation and the results of other diagnostic procedures. The antibody tite r of a single serum specimen cannot be used to determine a recent infection. Paired samples (acute and convalescent) should be collected and tested concurrently to demonstrate seroconversion. Samples collected too early in the course of an infection may no t have detectable levels of IgG. In such cases, a second sample may be collected after 2 -7 weeks and tested concurrently with the original sample to look for seroconversion. A positive Measles IgG test in neonates should be interpreted with caution since p assively acquired maternal antibody can persist for up to 6 months.

Additional Information: For more information, see the CDC link at: https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html Purpose of Test: For detection of IgM antibodies to measles virus. Test available only to MDH epidemiologists for outbreak investigations. Prior approval by MDH Epidemiology (410 -767-6628) required. Method: ELISA Interfering Substances: High levels of Measles IgG and Rheumatoid factor can cause false positive or negative results. CMV IgM, HSV1 I gM, and HSV2 IgM antibodies cross react and may lead to false positive results. Some antinuclear antibodies have been found to cause a false positive reaction. Potential cross -reactivity with RSV and parainfluenza cannot be ruled out. Test results from im munocompromised patients should be interpreted with caution. Testing Site: MDH Laboratories Administration, Central Laboratory 1770 Ashland Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21205 Comment: Results of the Measles IgM ELISA are not by themselves diagnostic and should be interpreted in light of the patient's clinical condition and results of other diagnostic procedures. Samples taken too early during the course of a primary infection may not have detectable levels of Measles specific IgM. A negative result does n ot rule out a primary infection with virus. The Measles IgM ELISA cannot distinguish the difference between vaccine -induced antibody and antibody resulting from a natural infection. False positive IgM results may be obtained from patients with autoimmune d isease. The performance of the Measles IgM ELISA has not been validated using neonatal samples.

Packaging and Shipping *: Specimens must be packaged in a triple packaging system to ensure that under normal conditions of transport they cannot break, be punctured or leak their contents ( Refer to page s 9 & 10 for triple packing guidance). *Refer to current Federal regulations fo r specific shipping requirements. Transport Conditions: Ambient temperature for specimens on the blood clot (whole blood specimens transported on ice packs are acceptable), separated serum a t 28\u00b0C (refrigerated) or 20\u00b0C (frozen). Refrigerated specimen m ust be tested within 7 days of collection. Specimen Rejection Criteria: Discrepancy between name on tube and name on form, unlabeled specimen; hemolytic; lipemic; gross bacterial contamination. Specimens collected > 7 days prior to submission. Availability: Service available only to state and local health departments Monday to Friday. Results and Interpretation: Negative: Indicates no detectable IgG antibody to Rubella virus. A negative results indicates no current or previous infection with Rubella virus. Such individuals are presumed to be susceptible to primary infection. However, specimen taken too early during a primary infection may not have detectable levels of IgG antibody. If primary infection is suspected, another specimen (convales cent) should be taken in 8 -14 days and tested concurrently in the same assay with the original (acute) specimen to look for seroconversion. If acute specimen is negative and convalescent specimen is positive, seroconversion has taken place and a primary ru bella virus infection is indicated. Equivocal: Equivocal results are indeterminate. Patient may or may not have immunity to Rubella Virus. It is not acceptable proof of immunity. Positive: Indicates evidence of Rubella IgG antibodies . This suggests past or current infection with Rubella virus, via acquired immunity or vaccination and probable protection from clinical infection (Immunity). Additional Information: For more information, see the CDC link at: https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/ Purpose of Test: For detection of IgG antibodies to Rubella virus. The test can be used to evaluate single sera for immune status or paired sera to demonstrate seroconversion. Method: Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA) Interfering Substances: Test results in an immunocompromised patients should be interpreted with caution. Testing Site: MDH Laboratories Administration, Central Laboratory 1770 Ashland Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21205 Comment: A diagnosis should not be made on the basis of anti -Rubella results alone. Test results should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical evaluation and the results of other diagnostic procedures. The antibody titer of a single serum specimen cannot be used to determine a rece nt infection. Paired samples (acute and convalescent) should be collected and tested concurrently to demonstrate seroconversion. Samples collected too early in the course of an infection may not have detectable levels of IgG. In such cases, a second sample may be collected after 2 -7 weeks an d tested concurrently with the o riginal sam ple to look for seroconversion. A positive rubella IgG test in neonates should be interpreted with caution since passively acquired maternal antibody can persist for up to 6 mon ths.

A negative result indicates no current infection with rubella virus. However, specimens taken too early during a primary infection may not have detectable levels of IgM antibody. If a primary infection is suspected, another specimen s hould be taken within 7 days and tested concurrently in the same assay with the original specimen to look for seroconversion Equivocal: Equivocal specimens are indeterminate. Another specimen should be collected after 7 days and retested. Positive: Indicates evidence of Rubella IgM antibodies. This suggests primary or reactivated infection with Rubella. Additional Information: For more information, see the CDC link at: https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/ Purpose of Test: Test available only to MDH epidemiologists for outbreak investigations. Prior approval by MDH Epidemiology (410 -767-6628) required. Method: ELISA Interfering Substances: High anti -Rubella IgG or Rheumatoid factor may cause false negative or false positive results. Test results in an immunocompromised patients should be interpreted with caution. Heterotypic IgM antibody responses may occur in patients infected with Epstein - Barr virus, and sera from patients with infectious mononucleosis may have false positive results. Patients with autoimmune disease may present with false positive results. Testing Site: MDH Laboratories Administration, Central Laboratory 1770 Ashland Ave nue, Baltimore, Maryland 21205 Comment: Results of the Rubella IgM ELISA are not by themselves diagnostic and should be interpreted in light of the patient's clinical condition and results of other diagnostic procedures. Samples taken too early during the course of a primary infection may not have detectable levels of rubella specific IgM. A negative result does not rule out a primary infection. This assay cannot distinguish the difference between vaccine -induced antibody and antibody resulting from a n atural infection.

Results and Interpretation: Negative: Indicates no detectable Varicella IgG antibodies. A negative results indicate no current or previous infection with Varicella virus . Such individuals are presumed to be susceptible to primary infection. However, specimen taken too early during a primary infection may not have detectable levels of IgG antibody. If primary infection is suspected, another specimen (convalescent) should b e taken in 8 -14 days and tested concurrently in the same assay with the original (acute) specimen to look for seroconversion. If acute specimen is negative and convalescent specimen is positive, seroconversion has taken place and a primary varicella virus infection is indicated. Equivocal: Equivocal results are indeterminate. Patient may or may not have immunity to Varicella Virus. It is not acceptable proof of immunity. Positive: Indicates evidence of Varicella IgG antibodies. This suggests past or curre nt infection with Varicella virus via acquired immunity or vaccination and probable protection from clinical infection (Immunity).

Method: Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA) Interfering Substances: Test results in an immunocompromised patients should be interpreted with caution. Testing Site: MDH Laboratories Administration, Central Laboratory 1770 Ashland Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21205 Comment: A diagnosis should not be made on the basis of anti -Varicella results alone. Test results should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical evaluation and the results of other diagnostic procedures. The antibody titer of a single serum specimen cannot be used to determine a recent infection. Paired samples (acute and convalescent) should be collected and tested concurrently to demonstrate seroconversion. Sam ples collected too early in the course of an infection may not have detectable levels of IgG. In such cases, a second sample may be collected after 2 -7 weeks and tested concurrently with the original sample to look for seroconversion. A positive Varicella IgG test in neonates should be interpreted with caution since passively acquired maternal antibody can persist for up to 6 months.

Testing Site: MDH Laboratories Administration, Central Lab oratory 1770 Ashland Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21205 Comment: Results of the Varicella IgM ELISA are not by themselves diagnostic and should be interpreted in light of the patient's clinical condition and results of other diagnostic procedures. Samples taken too early during the course of a primary infection may not have detectable levels of Varicella specific IgM. A negative result does not rule out a primary infection with rubella virus. This assay cannot distinguish the difference between vaccine - induced antibody and antibody resulting from a natural infection.

Additional Information: Continued Next Page> MD Department of Health -Laboratories Administration The J. Meh sen Joseph Public Health Laboratory Guide to Public Health Laboratory Services Page 121 of 142 February 2022 edition v2.0.12 Purpose of Test: Virus isolation to determine probable cause of infection and aid in the diagnosis of viral disease or to further characterization for epidemiological purposes. Method: Cell culture, viruses detected by cytopathic effect and/or antibody/fluorescent staini ng. Interfering Substances: Testing Site: MD Department of Health Laboratories Administration, Central Laboratory 1770 Ashland Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21205 Comment: The two most important steps in viral isolation are specimen collection and specimen transportation. Since the detection of viruses is more likely to be achieved early in the illness, specimens for most viral diseases should be collected as soon as a viral infection is suspected and submitted to the laboratory as soon as possible. Submission of adequate specimen and patient history is essential. A blanket request for \"Virus Study\" should not be submitted. Information must specify the group of viruses suspected. Please indicate suspected infecting agent as well as additional information such as chief symptoms, clinical test results, epidemiology data, immunizations, etc. This will guide the laboratory in choosing which virological procedures and host syste ms should be inoculated. Since many viruses die rapidly once they have been separated from host tissue, specimens must be delivered to the Virology Laboratory immediately after collection. Isolation of a virus from clinical material does not establish an etiologic diagnosis per se. The significance of such a virus depends upon the source of the isolate. For example, isolation of a virus from the brain in encephalitis or from the spinal fluid in aseptic meningitis provides direct evidence of an etiologic al association. Likewise isolation of an influenza virus from throat washings of a patient ill with an influenza -like disease strongly suggests that the virus is the causative agent since this virus is only isolated from throat washings in acute influenza . In contrast, the isolation of an enteric virus from the stool of a patient suffering from aseptic meningitis does not by itself indicate an etiological relationship, a s enteroviruses are sometimes found in th e feces of healthy individuals. Occasionally a virus other than the one ordered is detected since an y reaction in the host system is investigated. A negative viral culture report does not preclude the possibility of the suspect virus or another virus being involved in the patient's disease. The cult ures may be negative because of specimen procurement problems, such as prolonged transportation or processing delays, procurement of sample too late in the course of the disease, or inability of some viruses or viral strains to adapt to growth in the tissu e culture cell lines selected. For a more rapid diagnosis, Real -Time PCR detection tests for Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus, and Herpes simplex virus I and II are available.

This result does not rule -out Zika virus infection. Lack of serologic evidence of infection may reflect that the specimen was collec ted prior to the development of an antibody response. If indicated, please submit another serum specimen collected greater than 14 days after onset of illness for further testing. Other Flavivirus Positive: Specimen tested presumptively positive for IgM antibody to another flavivirus. There still may be low levels of Zika IgM antibody present and follow up testing is required; the possibility of co -infections must also be considered. Confirmatory testing of positive serology test results will be performe d by Plague Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT). Positive : Specimen tested presumptively positive for IgM antibody to Zika virus. Presumptive positive confirmatory testing will be performed by Plague Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT). Virus specif ic IgM antibodies can be detectable equal to or greater than four days after onset of illness. It has been reported that IgM antibodies typically persist for approximately 2 -12 weeks. Additional Information: https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html Comment: The results should not be used as the sole means of clinical diagnosis, treatment, or for patient management. Clinical correlation is required. Results from immunocompromised patients must be interpreted with caution. Single acute -phase specimen can be inconclusive.
