N2O is used at maternity wards and at dental offices in Norway. Addi- tionally, a few hospitals use N 2O for sedation of children for minor hos- pital procedures. The objective for the present report , is to systematically summarize published results on effectiveness us ing nitrous oxide in a paediatric setting for small, but painful hospital procedures. Safety issues for both the patients and health personnel ex posed to nitrous oxide will also be reviewed. The most important findings in this HTA is: N 2O can be used for sedation of children without serious adverse events The most prominent advantage with N 2O may be the short recov- ery time compared to other active drugs Health personnel (midwives and dental assistants) exposed to N2O compared to no exposure did no t increase the risk of sponta- neous abortion Health personnel did not show re duced fertility at low exposure, but at high exposure The risk of congenital malfunctions in children was higher in N 2O exposed mothers than mothers with no exposure No conclusions can be drawn on the effect of N 2O on damage to DNA or other cellular mechanisms We did not find any studies on ne gative health effects in health personnel using N 2O as sedation of children for small hospital procedures The evidence for safety for health personnel had very low certainty due to the study design (retrospecti ve cohorts) and that information about exposure levels were scarce. For health personnel working with N2O sedation of children we expect a significantly lower exposure than what was suggested in the cohorts because of present ventilation and scavenging systems of waste gas and since each procedure will be short (maximum 30 minutes) and the number of procedures per week will be minor (perso nal communication). Title: Effectiveness and safety of nitrous oxide as sedation regimen in children - an HTA Type of publication: Health technology assessment Health technology assessment (HTA) is a multidisciplinary process that summarizes information about the medical, social, economic and ethical issues related to the use of a health technology in a systematic, transparent, unbiased, and robust manner.

For successful procedures, as well as effective use of time and personnel, efforts are made to choose an efficient combination of analgesics and sed- atives. tissues. It is an effective analgesic/anxio- lytic/sedative agent causing central nervous system depressi on and euphoria with lit- tle effect on the respiratory system. Nitrous oxide has a rapid uptake, as it is being absorbed quickly from the alveoli, and is ex creted quickly from the lungs. As nitrous oxide is 34 times more solu ble than nitrogen in blood, diffusion hypoxia may occur (2). Several guidelines (1;2) include nitrous oxide in their lists of alternative sedation methods in children. A system atic review by Pedersen et al. (3) summarize literature on nitrous oxide as a sedation method for minor paediatric procedures, suggesting it to be a safe and efficient sedation me thod which may ease the procedures. Nitrous oxide has been considered safe for a patient who is exposed for a short time or only few times (3). However, adverse e ffects on health personnel is a greater con- cern (4). N2O is a suspected reproductive to xicants that may affect fertility, the rate of spontaneous abortion and congenital abnormalities. In addition, the risk of neu- rological effects and headache, fatigue and i rritability, has limite d the use of the gas in many settings. Also, damaging effects to DNA or to important metabolites in cel- lular or body function, as for example B12, has been studied with contradictory re- sult. Objective The objective for the present report, is to systematically summ arize published re- sults on effectiveness using nitrous oxide in a paediatric setting for small, but painful hospital procedures. Safety issues for bo th the patients and health personnel ex- posed to nitrous oxide will also be reviewed. 9 Executive summary Method We performed a Health Technology Assessment on effectiveness and safety of nitrous oxide for sedation in children in accordan ce handbook \"Slik oppsummerer vi forskning\", by Norwegian Instit ute of Public Health (5). We found literature from both hospital and dental settings. As our commissioner represents a hospital settings, we decided to narrow our report to only include effi- ciency assessment of literature covering a hospital setting. However, in the assess- ment of safety for health personnel, we in cluded results also from dental setting. Results Literature search We included 22 randomized controlled trials for the analyses of effect and safety of children. We also included 15 non-randomized controlled trials (19 articles) to docu- ment safety concerns of health personne l exposed to waste nitrous oxide. For the records only, we made a table of another 58 non-randomized controlled trials re- porting results on safety of anaesthetic ga ses to health personnel, where nitrous ox- ide most likely is a part of the gas. Effectiveness of nitrous oxide We have shown that health personnel or pa tients had a higher satisfaction level, lower distress or anxiety, and higher success rate when N 2O was used compared to the placebo group. Ho wever, when other sedatives were used, N 2O showed no bene- fit. Further, the pain level was lower using N 2O compared to midazolam and/or ket- amine, but not to EMLA or placebo. The certainty of evidence were from low to moderate, mostly due to lack of blinding and imprecision of the results. Most evident results was the reduced recovery time using N 2O over other active drugs, not surprisingly as N 2O has a very rapid onset and offset time. The certainty of evidence were high due to the pronounced differences in time and the objectivity in the outcome. Safety of nitrous oxide Fifteen studies (19 articles) reported data on adverse events. Of 525 patients sedated with N 2O, independent of hospital procedure or control group, none of the adverse events reported met the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's definition of a serious adverse events. In particular, none of the study participants experienced serious car- diac or respiratory events (including oxyg en below saturation level). Nausea, vomit- ing, restlessness, and euphoria were the most common adverse events observed in the N 2O group. 10 Executive summary Health personnel exposed to waste N 2O only, did not have an increased odds ratio for spontaneous abortion for none of the levels of N 2O exposure (low exposure (OR=0.89; 95%CI=0.67, 1.19), high exposu known exposure (OR=1.30; 95%CI=0.43, 3.88)). However, there were a dose dependent increase in the odds ratio for reduced fertility in N 2O exposed health care personnel exposure: the adjusted rate of congeni- tal abnormalities in children was higher in N 2O exposed women than in the control group (5.5\u00b10.95, N=579 vs 3. 6\u00b10.34, N=2882). The certainty of the effect estimate was very low for all results. Sister chromatid exchange, micronuclei form ation, DNA breaks and reactive oxygen species were methods to stud y the genotoxic effect of N 2O exposure. The four in- cluded studies did not report evidence to reveal a potential genotoxic effect of N 2O in the given settings (both dental offices and operating rooms). This was also true for the three included studies of neurological toxicity of N 2O and for the four included studies of the effect of N 2O on B12 metabolism. Discussion We included 19 randomized controlled trials in the analyses for effectiveness and safety for children. However, the studies used different effect estimates and the data were presented differently. It was not possible to obtain high certainty of evidence for the outcomes analysed due to poor presentation of data as well as wide confidence intervals. However, the findings support that N 2O works similarly or better than ex- isting sedation methods and that it also sh ow an analgesic effect. Further, there were no serious adverse events reordered in any of the included studies. Safety of health personnel exposed to N 2O has for long time been a greater concern. Numerous studies have been performed on safe ty issues for health personnel in dental setting or working in operating theatres, an alysing the effect of anaesthetic gases in general rather than N 2O only. All studies on safety fo r health personnel included in this review are taken from either dental settings, operating theatres or maternity wards, suggesting an everyday, continuous exposure to N 2O. The expected levels in a paediatric setting, as the background for this commission, using modern masks, ef- fective scavenging and vent ilation systems, and without an everyday exposure, will most probably be lower than in the studie s showing adverse toxic effects. Although not documented, the time-weighted average (TWA) for the subjects experiencing the adverse effects were probably exposed to levels far above the Norwegian TWA thresh- old of 50 ppm (4). Further, none of the ad verse effects are correlated to peak values, but rather to long term exposure at high levels. 11 Executive summary Conclusion The results show that nitrous oxide can be us ed for sedation of children without seri- ous adverse events. The most noticeable advantage by using N 2O is the short restitu- tion compared to other sedation metho ds which shortens the whole procedure and may streamline hospital procedures in children. The present technology assessment shows th at midwives and dental personnel ex- posed to N 2O compared to no exposure, did not increase the risk of spontaneous abor- tion or, at low exposure, reduced fertility. High exposure showed reduced fertility. The risk for congenital abnormalities born by exposed mothers (concentration or expo- sure degree not known) was higher than in non-exposed mothers. It is important to understand that these results are generated from data based on self-reporting ques- tionnaires. Also, information about le vel of exposure were inadequate. No sufficient evidence were shown to draw conclusions of the toxic effect of N 2O on DNA or cellular mechanisms. There were no studies on negative effects on reproductive health for health personnel in a setting where N 2O were used for sedation of children for small hospital proce- dures. The personnel included in the present studies, were expected to have a more or less continuous exposure to N 2O during their work hours. For personnel working with N 2O sedation of children for small hospital procedures the exposure is expected to be significantly lower than the health care workers in the studies where toxic effects were reported, justified by two reas ons. First, the concentration of N 2O is expected to be lower because the access to better scav enging and ventilation systems; and second, the net exposure time would be lower as the procedure time (maximum 30 minutes per procedure) and the number for the hospital procedures per health worker per week would be relatively fe w (personal communication). 12 Table of contents Table of contents HOVEDFUNN 2 SAMMENDRAG 3 Bakgrunn 3 Form\u00e5l 3 Metode 3 Resultat 4 Diskusjon 5 Konklusjon 5 KEY MESSAGES 7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 8 Background 8 Objective 8 Method 9 Results 9 Discussion 10 Conclusion 11 TABLE OF CONTENTS 12 PREFACE 14 OBJECTIVE 15 BACKGROUND 16 Available sedatives for children 16 Nitrous oxide 16 Nitrous oxide in a Norwegian setting 18 METHOD 19 Literature search and article selection 19 Data extraction and analyses 22 Addendum to project plan 23 Stakeholder involvement 23 RESULTS - EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY FOR PATIENTS 24 Literature search and article selection 24 13 Table of contents Review of systematic reviews 25 Description of included rand omized clinical trials 25 Hospital procedure satisfaction and ease of use 28 Patient-experienced distress, anxiety or cooperativeness during the hospital procedure 30 Hospital procedure characteristics 32 Patient experienced pain 34 Safety for patients 38 RESULTS - SAFETY FOR HEALTH PERSONNEL 40 Literature search and article selection 40 Description of included studies 41 Level of exposure of N 2O in the studies 45 Effect of N 2O on spontaneous abortion 47 Effect on fertility 48 Effect on children born by exposed women 49 Genetic toxicity 50 Neurological toxicity of N 2O 51 Effect of N 2O on B12 metabolism and othe r blood and urine markers 52 BUDGET IMPACT 53 DISCUSSION 54 Summary of results 54 Included studies on nitrous ox ide sedation in children 55 Included studies on health personnel exposed to only N 2O 56 Discussion of results 58 CONCLUSION 62 REFERENCES 63 APPENDIX 72 Appendix 1.

Project plan 175 14 Preface Preface RHF-Bestillerforum commissioned a Health Technology Assessment on the effec- tiveness and safety on the use of nitrous oxide sedation in children from the Na- tional Institute of Public Health (NIPH). The project group consisted of: Tjelle, Torunn Elisabeth, Senior scientist, FHI Eva Pike, Senior consultant Hafstad, Elisabeth, Info rmation specialist, FHI Bidonde, Julia, Senior scientist, FHI Harboe, Ingrid, Information specialist, FHI The aim of this report is to support well-i nformed decisions in health care that lead to improved quality of services. The evidence should be considered together with other relevant issues, such as clinical experience and patient preference. K\u00e5re Birger Hagen Director, Reviews and health technology assess- ment Lene K Juvet Department director metodevurdering 15 Objective Objective The main objective for the present report, is to systematically summarize published results on effectiveness using nitrous oxid e in a paediatric setting for small, but painful hospital procedures. Safety issues for the patien ts and health personnel ex- posed to nitrous oxide will also be reviewed. 16 Background Background Children (up to 18 years of age) who underg o painful procedures at hospitals, for ex- ample suture or lumbar puncture , are offered different kinds of pain relief (analgesics), often in combin ation with drugs for relaxation (sedatives). For success- ful procedures, as well as effective use of time and personnel, efforts are made to choose an efficient combination of analgesics and sedatives. Available sedatives for children Drugs classified as sedatives may exert one or several effects. Common effects, in ad- dition to the sedative effect are anxiolytic , amnestic, hypnotic and/or analgesic. The choice of sedatives depends on the procedur es to be carried out, procedure duration, effect needed, available personnel and previous experience with the child's respon- siveness to the procedure or sedative. The most commonly used sedative at paediatric departments in Norwegian hospitals is mi dazolam (6;7) which can be administered by several different routes (e.g. orally, in tramuscular, buccal and nasal spray). Other drugs used for childr are ketamine, propofol and sevofluran e and nitrous oxide gas. The use of these sedatives have been reviewed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guide- line in 2010 (1). According to this guidelin e nitrous oxide or midazolam are the active drugs recommended for a minimal to moderate sedation, also known as \"anxiolytic\" or \"conscious\" sedation, respectively (defined by American Society of Anesthesiolo- gists, ASA (8)). Nitrous oxide tissues. It is an effective analgesic/anxio- lytic/sedative agent causing central nervous system depressi on and euphoria with lit- tle effect on the respiratory system. Nitrous oxide has a rapid uptake, as it is being absorbed quickly from the alveoli, and is ex creted quickly from the lungs. As nitrous oxide is 34 times more solu ble than nitrogen in blood, diffusion hypoxia may occur (2). 17 Background Nitrous oxide is used as a sedative in dent al care for both children and adults (2;9) and for women in labour (10;11). The gas is normally used with oxygen in different concentrations, the most common being 50 -70% nitrous oxide (12). Administration is simple and painless and has a rapid onset and short duration of action. It has anal- gesic, anxiolytic and sedative effects. In Norway it is known as \"Medisinsk lystgass\" and a popular name in English is \"laughing gas\" or \"gas and air\". Several studies have documented the use of nitrous oxide sedation in children in hos- pital setting, in particular in the emergenc y department (13;14). Several guidelines (1;2) include nitrous oxide in their lists of possible sedation methods in children. A systematic review by Pedersen et al. (3) summarizes literature on nitrous oxide as a sedation method for minor paediatric procedures for example under peripheral ve- nous cannulations, lumbar punctures or intramuscular injectio ns. The authors con- clude that nitrous oxide is a safe and effective method to achieve analgesia and seda-tion during minor, but painful procedures . The authors therefore suggest that under the right conditions and with proper informat ion to the child, the use of nitrous oxide can ease hospital procedures which otherw ise would be performed using other seda- tives that requires longer time, both onset an d follow up time, more personnel, or even that it can substitute full anaesthesia. Safety profile of nitrous oxide Nitrous oxide is considered safe for the patient who is exposed for a short time or only few times. However, a debate about th e adverse effects on health personnel is still a concern. N2O is a suspected reproductive toxicants that may affect fertility, the rate of sponta- neous abortion and congenital abnormalities in health personnel who are highly ex- posed. In addition, the risk of neurologic al effects and headache, fatigue and irrita- bility, has limited the use of the gas in ma ny settings. Also, damaging effects to DNA or to important metabolites in cellular or body function, as for example B12, has been studied with contradictory result . Potential biological effects of N 2O and their mechanisms have been summarized by Sander s et al (4). Updated safety issues will be summarized in this report. European countries have made regulations for the protection of workers against the gas and introduced gas exposure limits measured by time-weighted average (TWA) nitrous oxide concentration limits, which is based on an 8-hour workday and a 40- hour workweek. For Norway and Denmark the TWA is 50 ppm, for UK and Ger- many the level is 100 ppm and in US it is 25 ppm (4). The rational for the different thresholds are not readily available, as the research in this field is mainly based on large retrospective surveys, where no recordings of the level of gas exposure related to the adverse effects were available, as will be shown in this report. Already in the seventies, scav enging systems for controlling N 2O concentration of in operating theatres, and thereby reducing the exposure level for health personnel, 18 Background were introduced. In an ad hoc study from 1972 it was shown that the mean concen- tration of N 2O in 14 operating theatres were reduced from 1080 ppm to 165 ppm without and with scavenging systems, respectively (15). A recent report (16) com- pared different inhalation techniques an d scavenging systems. They showed that more important than an on-demand valve (the gas is only delivered when the child inhales), the scavenging system is crucial for keeping the concentration of waste gas in the room below reference values. A sc avenging system can typically be a mask connected to an evacuation pump or e ffective ventilation system in the room. Nitrous oxide in a Norwegian setting In Norway, nitrous oxide is a registered drug used as an anaesthetic in combination with other inhalation anaesthetics or intravenous anaesthetics, and as an analgesic or sedation agent in all situations where instan t pain relieve is needed (17). The contra- indications for health personnel refers to studies showing increased risk of spontane- ous abortion and congenital malfunctions to children born by exposed women when scavenging systems are not sufficiently used. However, in the summary of product leaflet these results are disputed due to lo w quality and limited tr ansferability of the studies. As internationally, the gas is routinely us ed in dental offices where the method has been established and room ventilation is properly dimensioned for evacuation of waste gases. Further, maternity wards in No rway are still offering women in labour N 2O sedation (18), but several hospitals have quit this service, mainly due to safety concerns for health personnel, explained by poor ventilation syst ems at the maternity wards (19). Nitrous oxide sedation for use in children is not a standard sedation method in Nor- way, although it is used in some hospitals for minor hosp ital procedures (St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim and Akershus Universi ty Hospital, Oslo, personal communica- tion). In addition, there is one ongoing quality study invest igating the effectiveness of this sedative (\u00d8stfold Hospital Trust, personal communication). In the present Health Technology Assess ment, we will systematically summarize published results on effectiveness and safety using nitrous oxide in a paediatric set- ting for small, but painful hospital proced ures. In addition, we will systematically summarize published results on safety for health workers exposed to waste N 2O. 19 Method Method We performed a Health Technology Assessment on effectiveness and safety of nitrous oxide for sedation in children in accordan ce with vi forskning\", by the Norwegian Inst itute of Public Health (5). Literature search and article selection Search strategy for effectivene ss and safety for the children Inclusion and exclusion criteria We used the population, intervention, co mparison, outcome, and design (PICO) framework to evaluate the eligibility of evidence fo r inclusion of studies ( Table 1 ). Table 1. PICO-S framework for effectiveness Population Children up to 18 years of age unde rgoing painful hospital procedures that require minimal or moderate sedation Intervention a) Nitrous oxide only b) Nitrous (sedatives/analgesics/anaes- thetics) b) Non-pharmacological intervention (e.g. psychological techniques) c) Control (treatment as usual) Outcome a) Hospital procedure satisfaction (e.g. ease, distress, anxiety) b) Hospital procedure characteristic s (e.g. successful procedural com- pletions, number of attempts, duration of procedure) c) Pain d) Safety of sedation Number of acute adverse events (e.g. vomiting, oxygen desatura- tion, cardiac arrest) Long term adverse effects (e.g. toxicity) due to repeated exposure Parameters of gas concentration in the procedure room or body 20 Method Adverse events due to combination with other sedatives/ analge- sics/ anaesthetics For each of the outcomes, data could be provided by the patient (child), caregiver (parent) or health personnel (medical staff). Study design Systematic reviews of randomized co ntrolled trials, health technology assessments (HTA) or randomized controlled trials. We excluded studies if: - Study designs not covered in the inclusion criteria - Patient groups scheduled for procedures only requiring the sleeping effect (for example imaging procedures) or for dental procedures. - Nitrous oxide concentration was below 50% - Nitrous oxide was used in combination with other drugs where the aim is to obtain or keep general anaesthesia Search strategy We performed a systematic search for litera ture to identify studies on the defined PICO. We searched the following databases 24. August 2017: Systematic reviews & HTA CRD database, HTA (Centre for Review s and Dissemination, University of York) Cochrane Library (Wiley): o Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews o Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects Epistemonikos Embase (OVID) PubMed (NLM) Randomized controlled trials (and no n-randomized studie s, if required) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley) PubMed (NLM)/MEDLINE (OVID) Embase (OVID) Ongoing, completed or termin ated (unpublished) trials Clinical Trials (National Institutes of Health, US) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO) The provided strategy was reviewed by tw o experienced information specialists. The search strategies are found in Appendix 2. The search strategies combined index term s and text words relating to population and intervention, adapting the search synta x to each database. We added filters for study design for the PubMed/MED LINE and Embase databases. 21 Method Search strategy for safety of health personnel Inclusion and exclusion criteria To ensure retrieval of relevant safety da ta for health person nel, we performed a search with a different PICO-framework than for the effectiveness data, focusing on health personnel as the population ( Table 2 ). Table 2. PICO-S framework for occupational safety Population Health workers exposed to N2O through their occupation Intervention Passive nitrous oxide exposure from sedation or general anaesthesia of patients Comparator No exposure or different levels of exposure to nitrous oxide Outcome Biological effects on health workers Study design Randomized controlled trials or non-randomized studies (Non-random- ized controlled trials, Controlled before-and-after study, Prospective co-hort study, Retrospective cohort st udy, Cross sectional studies, Case- control study (more than 50 particip ants), Case series (more than 100 participants)). We excluded studies if biological effect s were not reported. Search strategy We performed a supplementary search to id entify studies on health personnel expo- sure to nitrous oxide. We searched th e following databases 21. November 2017: Ovid MEDLINE(R) Epub tations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R) 1946 to Present Embase (OVID) 1974 to 2017 November 20 The search strategies combined index terms and text words (in the title and author keywords fields) relating to nitrous oxide and occupational expo sure. We did not use a filter for study design in this search. Th e full search strategy is given in Appendix 2. Article selection Two reviewers independently assessed titl es and abstracts to determine relevant full-texts to be examined. Subsequently, the same reviewers independently assessed the full-text publications to decide whic h studies we would include in the Health Technology Assessment. 22 Method Data extraction and analyses One review author (TET) extracted data from the included studies and another review author (EP) verified the data. We extracted the following data: Information about the study (authors, year of publication, setting and study design) Participant characteristics (number of part icipants in the tria l, age, procedure to be performed du ring intervention) Intervention and control characteristics (combination of drug, doses, length of exposure) Outcomes (endpoints examined, methods used to analyse outcome data, length of follow up and loss to follow up) Statistical analyses and presentation of results We analysed dichotomous data by calculating relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence inte rval (CI). Continuous data were pre- sented as standardized mean difference calculated from the mean value and stand- ard deviation (SD) using RevMan 5.3. If mean values were presented with standard error of the mean (SEM), we calculated the standard deviation by the formula SD=SEM* n, where n is the population. For data presented by the investigators in a form where it was not possible to extract mean values with correspondi ng standard deviation, or absolute numbers, we pre- sented the results in a narrative form. Assessment of methodological risk of bias Two review authors assessed the quality of the included studies independently by evaluating risk of bias of ra ndomized controlled trials using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool ( http://training.cochrane.org/handbook , Chapter 8.5a). For surveys and other non randomised controlled trials we used a simplified form of the ROBINS-I tool (see Appendix 3). The Cochrane-tool classifies the risk of bias as low, uncertain or high while ROBINS-I uses low, moderate, serious, critical or no information. We resolved disagreements by discussions or, if required , by consulting one of the other review authors. Certainty of the evidence We assessed the certainty of the evidence for each selected outcome using the GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations Asse ssment, Development, and Evaluation, http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/ ). We did this by ascertain the strength of the study design, possible risk of bias, imprecis ion and inconsistency of the estimates, and indirectness and magnitude of effect, dose response gradie nt and potential confound- ing factors. The GRADE system classifies th e certainty of the evidence as high, mod- erate, low, or very low for each outcome. 23 Method Addendum to project plan In the original plan, the population was id entified as children undergoing short and painful hospital procedures. In the first se arch, no information about safety for the health personnel working with the procedure was found. Since the commissioner, as well as the external experts, stressed the importance of safety of health personnel, we extended the project plan to perform a separate search to identify studies con- cerning safety for health personnel, independent to setting. An addendum to the project plan was ma de (Appendix 10). We also included cross sectional studies fo r analyses of safety of health personnel, which was not in the original project plan. Stakeholder involvement Two external clinical experts and two intern al research directors were invited to re- view and give feedback on the project plan , including the inclusion and exclusion cri- teria, as well as to the report. We also collected personal experience with the method from hospitals in Norway. We contacted the producer of the device presently used for N 2O sedation of children in Norway, Livopan, provided by AGA to understand the method and differences from administration to other patient groups as women in la- bour. 24 Results - effectiveness and safety for patients Results - effectiveness and safety for patients Literature search and article selection The search results for randomized controll ed trials and systematic reviews are pre- sented in Figure 1 and Appendix 2. There were 21 systematic reviews and 34 random- ized controlled trials to be screened in full text. We found fo ur systematic reviews which corresponded to our specifications an d 22 randomised controlled trials (RCT) (Table 3 ). The excluded articles (2 1 systematic reviews and 12 RCTs) are listed in Ap- pendix 4 with reasons for exclusion. Figure 1. Flow chart of article selection for randomized controlled trials and sys- tematic reviews 25 Results - effectiveness and safety for patients Review of systematic reviews We reviewed four systematic reviews (see de scription of the studies in Appendix 5). Data on N 2O in the systematic reviews were presented narratively and three of the reviews concluded that there were insufficient data to draw any conclusions (20-22) while one review concluded a lower anterograde amnesia using N 2O compared to benzodiazepines (23). All of the RCTs incl uded in the systematic reviews were in- cluded in our search. We did therefore not perform any analyses of the results from the systematic reviews. Description of included rand omized clinical trials We included 22 randomized controlled trials, listed in Table 3 . The total number of patients were 1.692, ra nging from 14 to 204 in the different tri- als. The age of the children were from prem ature babies to 18 ye ars, and with both genders. All children were classified as normal healthy patients (ASA I), to patients with mild systemic disease (ASA II), acco rding to the ASA (American Society of An- aesthesiologists) physical stat us classification system. The trials were published from 1990-201 5 and were performed in Europe (n=7), North America (n=7), South America (n=1), Australia (n=1), Asia (n=4), and Africa (n=2). One of the trials was a multicentre trial (Carbajal), the others performed at a single centre. Eight of the trials compared N 2O with EMLA (a eutectic mixture of local anaesthetic cream with lidocaine and procai ne, cutaneous application) ( Table 3 ); 7 studies com- pared N 2O with placebo gas or standard care, and 6 studies compared N 2O with other analgesics. One trial compared N 2O with play therapy. Typically, face mask with O 2 or mixture of N2 and O 2 was used as the only control or together with the control drug in the blinded studies. The hospital procedures performed in the stud-ies were (n=2) and other procedures (n=8). Sixteen of the trials were blinded of wh ich twelve were double-blinded and four partly blinded. For the partly blinded, one of the trials the observer doing the assess- ments was blinded for all endpoints (24) and in three trials the observers were only blinded for some of the endpoints (13;25;26). Five of the trials were not blinded (27- 31), and for one of the trials (32) it was unclear whether it was blinded or not (see Table 3 for corresponding references). 26 Results - effectiveness and safety for patients Table 3.

In the studies, the three first categories were recorded by different scales and recorded by different persons (i.e. patients, parents, health personnel, investigators) . When the same outcome was reported by several different people in the same study, we only present one of the data sets, in the following prioritized order: patient, op erator and parent. In a situation where re- cordings were performed by either patient or nurse, depending on the age group, the recordings including most patients were used. Type of hospital procedure and which comparative drug used, were most often linked, as for venous cannulation the topical drug EMLA was used as a comparator and for fracture reduction and laceration repair most often midazolam or ketamine was used. In our analyses, we sub-grouped the comparators, not the hospital proce- dure or hospital setting. Risk of bias We used the RevMan risk of bias tool to an alyse and visualize the risk of bias in the included trials. The results are shown un der the analyses of each outcome. Hospital procedure satisfaction and ease of use We extracted data from the articles reportin g on satisfaction by patients, parents or operators based on measures of satisfaction with the procedure and the ease of per- forming it. In Table 4 we have presented the available data as no statistically signifi- cant difference (NS) or statisticall y significant difference (+) between N 2O sedation and the comparator in favour of N 2O. In four of 11 studies, the procedure satisfaction was reported by the patient while the remaining was scored by observing the patient. The results show that when N 2O was compared to another active drug, there were no significant difference in procedure satisfaction between the two sedation method s in 7 of the 8 studies, representing a population of 444 patients, while 1 of the datasets, representing 60 patients, showed a statistical significant difference between the two groups. For the three studies (237 participants) where N 2O was compared with placebo or standard care, all showed statistical significant difference between the groups. No studies showed that the sedation method changed the ease or effectiveness of performing the hospital procedure itself, acco rding to the investigator or nurse. This is in line with the satisfaction results, in dicating that the seda tion method does not influence the performance of the actual procedure. The summary of findings are pre-sented in Table 5 . 29 Results - effectiveness and safety for patients Table 4.

Certainty of effect estimate for sa tisfaction and ease of procedure For each outcome and control intervention there were only one study which pre- sented results with standard deviation. Seve ral studies only presented their data in a narrative form concluding whether there we re statistical or non-statistical differ- ences between the groups. We therefore presented the results in a narrative form in the available GRADE-tool ( Table 5 ). All studies were randomized controlled trials. However, we downgraded the certainty of evidence based on lack of blinding in some studies (limitation in design) an d also due to unclear precision. Table 5.

All five studies comparing N 2O with another active drug 31 Results - effectiveness and safety for patients showed no statistical significant differenc e between the groups, while all three stud- ies showed statistical significant lower distress in the N 2O group compared to the placebo group (O 2 or standard care) ( Table 6 ).

The results are pre- sented in Table 8 . Further, the summary of findings are presented in Table 9 . All five studies with an active drug as a comparator showed shorter recovery time for the N 2O sedation regimen. The percentage of successful procedures were higher for sedation by N 2O than for other drugs or placebo in 4 of the 5 studies. Procedure time and total procedure time were also measur ed in several studies. However, as the procedures were different and the authors presented different start and end points of the timing, we did not make any summary of those results. Table 8.

See Appendix 1 for details about scales used. Meta-analyses of pain data We extracted mean and standard deviation in 11 of the 19 studies that reported data on pain. The remaining 8 studies did not present data which was possible to extract for a meta-analyses (lack of numbers or variation). These were combined and ana- lysed in forest plot and presented as standa rdized mean difference. The risk of bias for each study are shown in th e plots. Of note is that we combined studies independ- ent of which hospital procedure was used. Venous cannulation was the procedure for all but one (Palivizumab inje ction) study for the EMLA subgroup, while for mid- azolam/ketamine subgroup three procedures were studies; venous cannulation, fracture reduction and void ing cystourethography. The results showed that when the N 2O group was compared with the analgesic EMLA for venous cannulation, the standa rdised Figure 2 ). However, N 2O showed a statistically significant lower pain score when compared to the sedative midazolam or a combination of midazolam and keta mine (SMD=-0.55, 95 %CI=-0.88,-0.22; p=0.001). Compared to a placebo group, the N 2O group showed a standardized mean differ- ence in pain score of -0.10 (95%CI=-0.38, 0.17) ( Figure 3 ). This is in contrast with the vote counting from Table 10 where sedation by N 2O seems to be associated with lower feeling of pain in all the 5 includ ed studies when compared to placebo. 37 Results - effectiveness and safety for patients Figure 2. Experienced pain by patients sedated with N2O vs active drug Footnotes (1) The author report this to be a nonsignificant difference i n the article, while it is significant in our metaanalyses. Th is is probably due to the different statistic al tests being used. For EMLA subgroup: One article from Table 10 was not included i n this metaanalyses. The results from this article showed no d ifference between the groups, supporting the results in the metaanalyses . For midazolam or ketamine/midazolam subgroup: Two articles from Table 10 were not included in this metaanalyses. The results from these articles showed no differences between the groups, which may cause a skewing of the results in the metaanalyses towards no differ ence. Figure 3. Experienced pain by patients sedated with N2O vs placebo Footnotes (1)(2) The authors report this to be a significant difference, while it is nonsignificant in our meta analyses. This is prob ably due to the differ ent statistical te sts being used. Three articles from Table 10 were not included in this metaana lyses. The results from these articles showed significant lower pain score in the N2O group, which may cause a skewing of the results in the metaa nalyses towards a significant difference between the groups. Certainty of effect estimate - pain Summarizing the meta-analyses and the narrative presentation of the data in Table 10, the potential difference in pain betwee n the groups in all cases are minor and probably not of clinical significance. The ce rtainty of effect estimate presented in the meta-analyses is considered to be moderate ( Table 11 ). 38 Results - effectiveness and safety for patients Table 11.

Safety for patients Fifteen studies (19 articles) reported data on adverse events (7;13;25;28;30;31;35;37;39;41;42;44;45). We have presented the crude results of ad- verse events experienced by the use of N 2O across all studies and control groups, due to the limited information if analysed sepa rately for each comparator and treatment. Of 525 patients sedated with N 2O, independent of hospital procedure or control group, none of the adverse events reported met the U.S. Food and Drug Administra- tion's definition of a serious adverse event (46). In particular, none of the study par- ticipants experienced serious cardiac or re spiratory events (including oxygen saturation level). vomiti ng (0%-13.2%) were the most frequent adverse events observed in the N 2O group. Of 47 patients undergoing fracture reduc- tion, 4 patients suffered ataxia (26)). Children receiving N were more agitating euphoria CI95%=1.37,436) than in the EMLA group. Children receiving midazo- lam experienced 0.1) than in the N 2O group. These were the only statistically significant differences. Append ix 6 presents result s for all the adverse events in detail. All reported adverse events occurred during or shortly after the procedure. 39 Results - effectiveness and safety for patients Certainty of effect estimate - safety N2O possibly does not lead to serious adverse events (low certainty evidence). This judgement is based on no serious adverse events being reported in the 15 random- ized controlled trials included in this review with a relatively few number of patients (a total of 525). The results on frequency of experiencing certain adverse events under N 2O sedation is uncertain (low certainty evidence) due to the variation between the trials and the low number of events. Further, the risk of experiencing adverse events using N 2O compared to the control groups is also low certainty evidence due to the high confi- dence intervals. 40 Results - safety for health personnel Results - safety for health personnel Literature search and article selection After reading through the full text versions of the included articles in the efficacy studies we concluded that there were no da ta on safety for health personnel. We therefore performed a second systematic se arch, as described under Methods, with health personnel as the population of inte rest. We retrieved 557 articles by the sys- tematic search. However, we realized that limiting the search to N 2O, we lost several studies on N 2O in combination with other gases or in general anaesthesia. We there- fore also performed an extensive hand-searc h in the retrieved articles and found 41 articles for full text evaluation. We included 15 studies which investigated the effect of N 2O only (Appendix 7) and 58 studies with data on the effect of general anaesthe- sia or N 2O in combination with other gases on health personnel (Appendix 8). The excluded articles are listed in Appendix 4 with reasons for exclusion. 41 Results - safety for health personnel Figure 4. Flow chart of article selection for occupational safety Description of included studies All the studies were controlled, however no ne were randomized. Only fifteen studies (Appendix 7) reported N 2O exposure on sufficient level of detail to allow inclusion in the following analysis. The re maining 58 articles are on ly shown in Appendix 8. The 15 studies were published in 19 ar ticles from 1980 to 2016, see summary Table 12. Nine of the articles showed information about N 2O concentration in the air and six articles stated that a scavenging system was used (see Table 13 ). The 15 studies were published in 19 articles . All of the 15 studies, except two (47;48) describe how they handled possible confounders, either by matching the control group to the exposed group with respect to these, or by adjusting their analyses for specific confounders. Confounding factors are given in the risk of bias table in Feil! Fant ikke referansekilden. . Three large retrospective cross sectional studies presented data in seven articles: These were the only studies to present endpoints for spontaneous abortion, fer- tility, or congenital malformations of ch ildren born by exposed women. The in- clusion/exclusion criteria or other reason s that reduced the numbers of eligible persons were well accounted for in all the three surveys and the response rates were from 69-84%. 42 Results - safety for health personnel - Epidemiological survey, USA, 1968-1978 (4 9;50): Questionnaires were sent to male dentist of the American Dental Asso ciation for the exposure period 1968 to 1978. About 15 000 male dentist and 15 000 female dental assistants were in- cluded in the analyses. The exposure was N 2O only. The endpoints were sponta- neous abortion and congenit al abnormalities in one pu blication (49), and neuro- logical diseases in the other publication (50). - Epidemiological survey, USA, 1987-1988 (51;52): Question naires were sent to fe- male dental assistants in USA, more spec ific to the dental-assistant registry of California. The questionnaires were followed up by telephone interviews con- ducted in the period 1987-88. The exposure was N 2O alone. The endpoints were fertility, where 418 women were included in the analyses (51), and spontaneous abortion, were 1465 women were included in analyses (52). This was the only survey that gave information about use of scavenging system and compared the effect on fertility with and withou t the use of scavenging systems. - Epidemiological survey, Sweden, (53-55): Qu estionnaires were sent to midwives, born 1940 and after, registered in the Swedish Midwives Association. The expo- sure was N 2O and shift work. This su rvey resulted in thre e publications; Ahlborg et al (53) presented fertility data were 1484 pregnancies of 751 women were in- cluded in the analyses; Axelsson et al (5 4) presented data on spontaneous abor- tion, including 1717 pregnancies (number of women not given); and Bodin et al (55) showed data for birth weight and gestational age, incl uding 1781 pregnan- cies of 1302 women. Nine controlled studies were controlled presenting exposure data from blood sam- ples: - Four trials presented data on potential toxic effect of N 2O on DNA. Different as- says were used: sister chromatid exchan ge (56), micronuclei formation (57), comet assay (58;59), and reactive oxygen species (59). All trials included less than 150 participants. The study subjects were male and female dentists, chair- side female dental assist ants, or female nurses. - Four trials presented data on the effect of N 2O on B12 through the analyses of different markers in the blood (48;60-62) . All were small trials with 2-185 par- ticipants. One of the trials were from a paediatric emergency department (62), the others were from operating theatres. - One trial measured the effect of N 2O on folate metabolism (63) Three studies showed results on the neurological effect of N 2O: - One study was a retrospective survey (50) (a part of the Epidemiological survey, USA, 1968-1978 described above) with qu estionnaires to identify neurological diseases/symptoms. - Two were small controlled trials, with less than 100 participants showing neuro- behavioral effects of N 2O using different test systems (47;64). 43 Results - safety for health personnel Table 12.

In addition, we included studies where general an- aesthesia (in 20 studies) were used, as N2O is one of several inhalation commonly used in general anaesthesia (67). We did no t analyse data from these studies, but a summary of the results and study characte ristics are presented in Appendix 8. Risk of bias We used a modified version of ROBINS-I to evaluate the risk of bias in the studies (see template in Append ix 3 and results in Feil! Fant ikke referansekilden. ). Level of exposure of N 2O in the studies The studies span from 1980 to 2016 and the technology of delivering gases, as well as ventilation and scavenging systems has changed through the time. We have ex- tracted information of N 2O concentration in the rooms as well as other measures of occupational exposure such as hours of exposure ( Table 13 ). In addition, some stud- ies mentioned whether the rooms were ventilated or had scavenging systems. Only one study mentioned that the mask used had an on-demand valve (62), meaning that gas only was delivered on the patient' s inhalation and not continuous flow of gas. Table 13.

The de- gree of N 2O exposure were divided into three ca tegories (no exposure, light exposure and heavy exposure) in two of the studies: low exposure were defined as less than 50% of deliveries by included midwifes (54) or as working in rooms with scavenging systems (51); high exposure were defined as more than 50% of deliveries or working in rooms with no scavenging systems. Th e two other studies (49;65) only showed data on no exposure- and exposure groups. In Figure 5 we show the effect of different levels of exposures of N 2O on spontaneous abortion. The results show that neither for low exposure (OR=0.89; 95%CI=0.67, 1.19), high exposure (OR= 1.30; 95% CI=0.43, 3. 88), there were a statistical significant increased odds for spontaneous abortion in the N 2O exposed groups. Figure 5. Effect of exposure vs no exposure of N2O on spontaneous abortion Certainty of evidence The summary of findings are presented in Table 14 . The results are taken from three large retrospective surveys, presented in 4 articles, with the risk of bias. The authors 48 Results - safety for health personnel adjusted for several confounding factors in cluding age, smoking, shift work and his- tory of spontaneous abortions in their analyses ( Feil! Fant ikke referansekil- den. ). We do not know the concentrations of N 2O in the room as the low and high exposure only relates to time exposed to the gas. As a summary, mainly due to the study design (see risk of bias assessment in Feil! Fant ikke referansekilden. ), the certainty of evidence is very low, implyi ng that we are not su re that the given re- sults represents the true effect of N 2O exposure. Table 14.

CI: Confidence interval; OR: Odds ratio Effect on fertility Two studies reported data on the effect of N 2O exposure on fertility (51;53) ( Table 12). The data were presented as rate of fertility or cycles to conception. More than 13 cycles to pregnancy was considered as a threshold number for infertility. We performed a meta-analyses on the percen tage of infertility given in the papers, not adjusted for confounding factors. We defined low and high exposure for the two studies to be scavenged and unscavenged rooms for the dental assistants (51) or more or less than 30 deliveries per month for the midwives (53). Women with high exposure to N 2O had an increased risk of infertility (OR=3.48; 95%CI=1.99, 6.08) in contrast to women with low exposure (OR=0.79; 95%CI=0.48, 1.30). The OR of the high and low exposure groups were statistically significantly different suggesting that the toxic effect of N 2O on fertility is concentration depend- ent. 49 Results - safety for health personnel Figure 6. Effect of exposure vs no exposure of N2O on fertility Certainty of evidence The summary of findings are presented in Table 15 . The results are taken from two large retrospective surveys based on questionnaires to a broad population, the same as described in the chapter of spontaneou s abortion. Therefore, mainly due to the design, the certainty of the evidence is very low. However, for fertil ity, in contrast to spontaneous abortion, the effect of N 2O is suggested to be dose dependent with in- creased odds of infertility in a high exposure group. Table 15.

CI: Confidence interval; OR: Odds ratio Effect on children bo rn by exposed women One study (49) showed results on the rate and nature of congenital abnormalities of children born to exposed parents. They foun d that the adjusted rate of abnormalities in the exposed group were higher compared to the non-exposed group (see Table 16 ). The degree of exposure was unknown. The adjusted odds ratio for low birth weight (defined as birth weight < 2500 grams) was not affected by N 2O exposure to the mother ( Table 16 ), although the exposure 50 Results - safety for health personnel lead to a minor reduction in birthweight of 77 g (95%CI=-129, -24) (55). The ad- justed odds ratio of preterm bi rth were not affected by N 2O exposure (55). Certainty of evidence The data included in the analyses are taken from two retrospective surveys (49;55). They are large and well-designed surveys with clear outcome measures. Due to the study design as well as few studies, the certainty of evidence was found to be very low. Table 16. Summary of findings table for effect of N2O on children born by exposed women Outcomes (ref) Effect of children (studies) Certainty of the evidence (GRADE) Congenital ab- normalities (49) The adjusted rate of congenital abnormalities in chil- dren born by N 2O exposed women is higher than in the control group (5.5\u00b10.95, N=579 vs 3.6\u00b10.34, N=2882, p=0.02). 3539 (1 Survey) VERY LOW Birth weight (55) N2O exposure did not affect the adjusted odds ratio of low birth weight (OR=1.5; 95%CI=0.7, 3.3) 4960 (1 Survey) VERY LOW Preterm birth (55) N2O exposure did not affect the adjusted odd ratio of preterm birth (OR=0.7; 95%CI=0.3, 1.4). 4960 (1 Survey) VERY LOW Genetic toxicity Four of the included articles showed results on genetic toxicity of N 2O to exposed health personnel (56;57;59;66). No mutagenic effect of N 2O exposure was found in female and male dentists and fe- male dental assistants as measured by si ster chromatid exchange (SCE) (statistics was not shown) (56). In this study, smokin g was the only factor statistically signifi- cant leading to an increase of SCE. Mutagenic stresses to the cell, as measured by micronuclei formation, showed a statisticall y significant increase in lymphocytes of female nurses with more than 5 years of continuous employment in paediatric an- aesthesia (57). However, the authors did not discuss the impact of the size of the dif- ference. Wronska-Nofer et al found a po sitive correlation between N 2O concentration and DNA damage in operating room personnel (Wroska-Nofer 2009(66): r=0.56, P<0.001; Wroska-Nofer 2012(59): N 2O and reactive oxygen species (59) (r=0.85, P<0.001). A causal relationship was also found between N 2O exposure and oxidative stress alt- hough the authors did not discuss the impact of the size of the difference (59). No correlation between sevoflurane or isoflu rane concentrations and DNA damage was found in these studies. 51 Results - safety for health personnel Certainty of evidence The results came from controlled, non-randomised studies. The population were small and for cellular and DNA damage or st ress it was not possible to draw any con- clusions due to inconsistent re sults. The certainty of evidence of an increased level of oxidative stress markers in N 2O exposed personnel, was considered low due to a small study population and only one study. Neurological toxicity of N 2O We included three articles that sh owed results on the effect of N 2O exposure on dif- ferent neurological outcomes (47;50;64). Brodsky et al (50) found a statistically sign ificant higher rate of subjects experienc- ing numbness, tingling, and/or muscle weakness in the N 2O exposed groups com- pared to non-exposed subjects. While the ra te for female dental assistants experi- encing these side effects was statisticall y significant higher for both the light (0.83\u00b10.10) and heavy exposures (1.46\u00b10. 24) compared to the non-exposed sub- jects (0.46\u00b10.09), the rate for male dentist was only statistically significant higher in the heavy exposure group (1.53\u00b10.24) comp ared to the control group (0.35\u00b10.07) (all values are mean rate with standard e rror). The same tendency was seen for an- other group of side effects being symptoms secondary to specific diseases as for ex- ample multiple sclerosis, Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, pernicious anaemia. Such com- plaints were 4-fold greater for women and 3-fold greater for men in the high expo- sure groups. The baseline (the non-expo sed group) were lower for these symptoms than the previous mentioned groups of symptoms (0.11\u00b10.04 for men and 0.16\u00b10.05 for women). Isolani et al (47) were not able to show any correlation between reaction time, stress level or arousal levels with levels of N 2O in urine in anaesthetists (both gender). They reported, however, differences in neurobehavioral reactions between the be- ginning and end of a work day or work week. In contrast, Scarpellato et al (64) found an increased reaction time in nurses (both genders) and decreased learning effect with N 2O levels in the urine ( 27 \u00b5g/l) compared to non-exposed nurses. Certainty of evidence The certainty of evidence of the one retrospective survey reporting different neuro- logical effects of N 2O, was considered very low due to the study design subjective outcomes. No conclusions can be draw n on neurobehavioral effects of N 2O due to contradictory results in the two included studies. 52 Results - safety for health personnel Effect of N 2O on B12 metabolism and other blood and urine mark- ers Four articles showed the effect of N 2O on B12 metabolism by analysing different markers in the B12 metabolism (48;60-62). The levels of B12 or B12 meta bolism markers in the study subjects were not statisti- cally significant different between the expo sed and non-exposed groups in three of the studies, N=82 (125 blood samples) (48;60;62). One st udy showed a decrease in the vitamin B12 concentration in the high exposure group (436.8 pmol/l (13.2) vs 372.8 pmol/l (12.1), p <0.001, N=185) (61). These studies also analysed other blood and urine markers summarized below: Hepatic enzyme activity was found normal in exposed subjects (60) Haemoglobin was found normal in two studies (48;61), but slightly higher in one study (62) Markers for folate metabolism were normal in two studies (61;63) Other haematological parameters as re d blood counts and haematocrit were not affected by N 2O exposure in one study (61) Certainty of evidence We were not able to draw any conclusions on the effect of N 2O on B12 metabolism or blood or urine markers studied in the includ ed trials. This was due to the discrepan- cies in the results and the few studies of each parameter measured. 53 Budget impact Budget impact We have not been asked to make any cost effectiveness or budget impact analyses in this report.

The most frequent non-serious adverse events in the N 2O group were agitation, dys- phoria, euphoria, excessive crying, headache and nausea and vomiting. Our findings from 15 cross sectional studies (19 articles) on safety for health person- nel exposed to N 2O were: The risk of spontaneous abortion were not increased in persons exposed to N2O. At low exposure of N 2O, no increased risk of re duced fertility was seen. The risk was however increased in health ca re personnel with high exposure to N2O. 55 Discussion The rate of congenital abnormalities in children born by exposed women was higher than in the control group. No in formation of exposure level was given. No conclusions of the effect of N 2O exposure on DNA damage could be drawn based on the different measures taken together (sister chromatid ex- change, Comet assay, micronuclei formation) The level of oxidative stress markers in N 2O exposed subjects was increased The rate of subjects exposed to N 2O who experience numbness, tingling, and/or muscle weakness were hi gher than non-exposed subjects The rate of subjects exposed to N 2O who experience symptoms specific to neurological diseases were high er than non-exposed subjects No conclusions could be drawn on neurobehavioral effects of N 2O No conclusions could be drawn on the effect of N 2O on B12 metabolism Scavenging systems is important to redu ce the level of waste gas exposure Certainty of effect estimates for all findin gs were considered very low due to the study design, few studies or contradictory results. Included studies on nitrous oxide sedation in children Population and setting We defined children undergoing painful ho spital procedures in need of conscious pain relive and sedation as the population of interest. We did no t include dental pa- tients as the commission was specific for hospital setting and procedures. Also, pro- cedures, length of procedures and equipmen t for delivery of the gas are different be- tween the hospital and dental setting. We al so excluded neonates from our analyses, both because N 2O is not widely used for this grou p of patients, but also since the tools for monitoring relevant outcomes are not as established as for the older chil- dren. The results presented is therefore only applicable for children from 1 year, and for a hospital setting. In Norway the method is used in the paediatric department (Akershus University Hospital) for venous cannulation and other small hospital pro- cedures and emergency department (St. Ol avs Hospital) for fracture reduction and suturing. In addition, \u00d8stfold Hospital Trus t uses the method in medical procedures as lumbar punctures, enemas, change of gastrostomy devices, venous cannulation and botulinum toxin injections, as well as surgical or orthopaedic procedures as wound stitching, fracture re duction, removal of osteosynthetic materials and foreign bodies. Intervention - N 2O sedation Most commonly, N 2O is used in an equimolar conc entration with oxygen. We in- cluded studies with both 50% and 70% N 2O with oxygen. We did not systematically analyse the effectiveness of other concentrations of N 2O, but most available litera- ture used 50% N 2O, which has been established as the common concentration for such procedures. A study comparing 50% an d 70% showed that both concentrations 56 Discussion was safe for children (68). In Norway, Li vopan (AGA), an equi molar delivery system including on-demand mask with scavenging system, is used in several hospitals where this method is in use (\u00d8stfold Hospital Trust, Akershus University Hospital). The principle behind the sedation method is that the child should hold the mask it- self to ensure that the child keeps conscious. Outcomes The studies used a wide variety of outcome measures as well as performed the trials in different settings as emergency depart ments, paediatric department and outpa- tient departments. The hospital procedures also differed between cluding venous cannulation, laceration repa ir, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and for two studies, the procedures were not described. In addition, different score systems were used for the outcomes. Further, many studies reported the results in a narrative form, not leaving actual numbers to the reader. It was therefore challenging to per- form meta-analyses and to summarize the results in a consistent way. Study design All study designs were randomized controlled trials. However, not all were blinded (16 of 22). When blinded, typically O2 we re given through the mask in the control group. Included studies on health personnel exposed to only N 2O Population and setting The aim was to assess the effect of N 2O exposure to health personnel as such, not limited to hospital workers, and included study subjects were therefore both health personnel working in a hospital setting (13 ar ticles) or a dental setting (6 articles). It is important to note, though, that N 2O levels tend to be higher in dental offices than in hospital operating r ooms (52), often explained by th at in dental offices only a nose mask can be used. Professions as operating room nurses, anae sthetists, emergency department person- nel, midwives, dental assistants and dentis ts were included in the studies. For all types of outcomes (Appendix 7) both gend ers were included. However, if exposed males were included for outc omes related to offspring, their spouses were also in- cluded in the analyses. Intervention - waste N 2O exposure For occupational exposure of N 2O there were numerous studies on the exposure of anaesthetic gases where N 2O was a potential constituent. We decided to perform a systematic analyses of the stud ies presenting results on N 2O exposure only, leaving exposure to general anaesthe tics or combinations of N 2O with other gases to only a summarising table. 57 Discussion There are several ways of estimating N 2O exposure; one is to count the amount of time being exposed to the gas, another is to determine the gas concentration in the room and a third way is to measure N 2O in the urine. All stud ies presenting data on spontaneous abortion and fert ility were retrospective surv eys, exposure to the gas was self-reported exposure time, an d the exposure concentration of N 2O was there- fore not available. It has been suggested th at at the time the population in Cohen et al's study was exposed (in th e seventies), the one larger study showing an increased odds ratio for spontaneous abortion, room co ncentrations of nitrous oxide were rou- tinely 1000-2000 ppm (69). We assume, supported by the information given in sev- eral of the older articles we included, that necessary ventilation of operating rooms or effective scavenging systems of wast e gas was not common at that time ( Table 13 ). For the newer studies (1999-2016) included in our report, showing neurobehavioral effects and blood-sample based outcomes , the exposure concentration of N 2O ranged from 20 to 800 ppm. Neither the Swedish survey (53;54) nor Ro wlands two surveys (51;52), studying spontaneous abortion and fe rtility, measured the exposure concentration of N 2O. However, Rowland et al (52) highlighted the significance of scavenging systems showing that the risk of spontaneous ab ortion increased by only a 3 hours N 2O expo- sure per week in dental offices without scavenging systems, compared to the crude population working in a scav enged office. A recent report (16) compared different inhalation techniques and scavenging systems for use in children. They introduce two technical details which may contribute to reduce the level of waste gas: an on- demand mask, where there is no continuous flow of gas, but the delivery is con- trolled by a valve to only release the gas when the child inhales; and a scavenging system which consists of a tube leading the exhaled gas from the mask and outside the room. An effective scavenging system will include a pump to actively evacuate the waste gas from the mask system. Messeri et al (16) showed that more than an on-demand valve, the scavenging system is important for the concentration of waste gas in the room. While an on-demand valve used in connection with a Mapelson B respiratory circuit (for drawing, see http://www.creaghbrown.co.uk/anae/bc.htm ) reduced the TWA of N 2O from 74.5 to 59.7 ppm, a double face mask, allowing a more effective scavenging system, reduced the TWA from 59.7 to 2.3 ppm (both lat- ter systems used an on-demand valve). Th e mask and scavenging system used for children in Norway are more similar to the less effective scavenging system with on- demand valve (personal communication with AGA). Outcomes The included studies showed data on spontane ous abortion, infertilit y, effect on chil- dren born by exposed women, genetic toxicity, neurological or neurobehavioral ef- fects or effects on B12 meta bolism. As none of the stud ies were randomized, it was important to identify confounding factors. The most relevant factors that the authors had adjusted for, were age, smoking, shift- work, diseases, other toxins or drugs, as well as response rate for questionnaires. Meta-analyses was possible only for sponta- neous abortion and in fertility, but mainly non-adjust ed numbers were used in our 58 Discussion analyses. The blood-based outcomes were small and for several, gave contradictory results. Study design Studies were either large retrospective surveys among dental personnel or midwives, or controlled studies from hospital or dental setting. None of the trials were blinded. For the studies reportin g on the effect of N 2O on reproductive health, all collected data came from questionnaires, and all conf ounding factors were self-reported. This was the main reason why we assessed all the surveys based on retrospective ques- tionnaires to have serious risk of bias, according to the ROBIN-I-tool. Discussion of results We found four systematic reviews analysing the effect of N 2O sedation in children where three of them concluded that there were insufficient data to draw any conclu- sions (20-22) while one review conclude d a lower anterograde amnesia using N 2O compared to benzodiazepines (23). Our Health Technology Assessment had a broader perspective as we did not limit the searches to specific hospital procedures or comparative drugs. We were therefore ab le to include more studies in our anal- yses. N2O as an analgesic We presented evidence that the patients experienced lower pain when N 2O was used as sedation method compared to other active drugs or no drugs. This suggests that although N 2O is mainly used as a sedation, it ha s also to some extent analgesic ef- fects. The mechanism for this has been summarized by Sanders et al (4). However, we cannot conclude that the pain is cons iderably reduced compared to other stand- ard analgesics as EMLA for small procedur es where topical pain reduction is suffi- cient. The available evidence therefore suggests that N 2O can be used interchangea- bly with other relevant analgesics for shor t and painful hospital procedures for chil- dren, depending on the available resources. N2O for specific hospital procedures The included studies mostly reported on ordinary and short lasting hospital proce- dures as venepuncture/venous cannulation, fr acture reduction and laceration repair. We decided not to perform su bgroup-analyses for the different hospital procedures covered by the studies due to that few resu lts were reported as numbers with varia- tion. In a systematic review by Pedersen et al (3) focusing on using N 2O 2O were found to be suitable for all of them. 59 Discussion Safety for the children Numerous adverse events were reported in 15 studies. Due to the low total number of both events (83 events divided on abou t thirty different types of events) and pa- tients (525 patients) we were not able to draw any certain conclusion of which types of side effects were the most frequent using N 2O, or the odds ratio of the events us- ing N 2O compared to the control grou p. The results show that N 2O can be used for sedation of children with out serious adverse events. Safety for health personnel exposed to N 2O as the only gas N2O effect on reproductive health The most serious adverse effects that N 2O exposure has been suspected to cause, are spontaneous abortion, infertilit y or congenital abnormalitie s in children born by ex- posed women. These effects suggest damages to DNA although the mechanism and level is not known. In our health technology assessment we found four articles with data on the effect of N2O exposure on spontaneous abortion, thre e from a dental setting (49;51;70) and one from a maternity ward (54). The result s show that the odds ratio for spontane- ous abortion in women were not significantl y different in any of the exposure groups compared to the unexposed group. None of the papers measured the concentration of N 2O in the room, but Rowland et al (52) su ggested that in dental offices without scavenging equipment, exposure during administration of N 2O often exceeded 1000 ppm while the concentration may be lower in hospital operating rooms due to better mask systems and air exchange. Only one of the four studies on reproductive health (49) showed a significant in crease in the odds ratio fo r both spontaneous abortions and congenital abnormalities in children born by exposed women. This study was a retrospective survey from a dental setting in the seventies, most probably without scavenging systems and poor room-ventilation . Further, a statistically significant de- crease in fertility was shown (51;70), but only at high exposure of N 2O. All the stud- ies used data collected by interviews or qu estionnaires mailed to women, implying a high risk of reporting bias. The certainty of the effect measure was therefore consid- ered to be very low for both spontaneous abortion and congenit al abnormalities in children. There was a dose-response for the fertility outcome and we upgraded this result to be of low certainty. To understand the relevance of these results in a Norwegian paediatr ic setting, it is important to translate the difference between high and low exposures to N 2O con- centrations in the room. This is challenging as none of the surveys presented data on actual concentrations. According to th e information outlined previously ( Interven- tion - waste N2O exposure ), we suggest that working in a none-scavenging environ- ment may will give N 2O concentrations from 1000-20 00 ppm while with using scav- enging systems the concentration may ra nge from 20-800 ppm. However, for all practical purposes, level of ex posure is related to the time exposed to a given concen- tration, shown by the international standard TWA, which relates to an 8 hour work- day. For two of the studies, th e number of deliveries using N 2O defined the high and 60 Discussion low exposure groups, while in other studies exposure hours per week was used to de- fine the groups ( Table 12 ). Estimating the TWA based on exposure time in a non- scavenged room when exposed 50% of the work day, will be 500-1000 ppm TWA, while with a scavenging system a similar calculation would sugge st a TWA of 10-400 ppm. A nurse using N 2O for sedation in a paediatric setting in a Norwegian hospital where scavenging systems are used, will probably only be exposed maximally 2 hours per day suggesting a TWA of maxi mally 25 ppm, which is below the Norwe- gian TWA threshold level of 50 ppm. Usin g a more effective scavenging system as described in Messeri et al (16), may further reduce the exposure. Neurological effects of N 2O Only one of the included studies (50) show ed data on neurological effects, and N 2O was shown to increase subjects experienci ng numbness, tingling or muscle weak- ness. This study was from 1981, in a dent al setting, and no information about scav- enging systems were given. We therefore assume that also here the level of exposure will be far above the TWA threshold for Norw ay, and no results relevant in a Norwe- gian setting can be presented. Blood-sample ba sed outcomes The included articles approaching the mutagenic effect of N 2O did not have compa- rable outcomes and conclusions were theref ore difficult to draw. One study showed statistically significant increased micronuclei formation (57) but did not discuss the impact of the difference, or the level of N 2O exposure. Another study found a posi- tive correlation between N 2O concentration and DNA damage (59;66), reactive oxy- gen species and oxidative stress (59). These studies showed the presence of other gases in the operating room, but we included them as the results were correlated to N2O only. However, a synergistic or additive effect of the other gases could not be ruled out. The impact or downstream effect for the mutagenic effects, were not dis- cussed. In one study, B12 was decreased in operating theatre nurses exposed to a mean of 419 ppm at minimum 5 hours per day (61), which gives a TWA of 260 ppm. How- ever, in three other studies, no differences in B12 metabolism markers were found. Although for some of the arti cles the concentration of N 2O was given, the exposure time was unclear and no dose -correlation could be made. Hence, for none of the blood-sample based outcomes we were able to extract rele- vant conclusions to a paediatric setting in Norway. Safety for health personnel exposed to anaesthetic gases where N2O is a component We decided to briefly look at the effect of anaesthetic gases or mixture of gases where N 2O was a constituent. All the data are presented in Appendix 8. Wiesner et al (71) raises the problem of st udying the isolated genotoxic effects of N2O in an anaesthetic setting, as the effect of other volatile anaesthetics, the chal- lenge of comparing data from different combin ations of anaesthetics as well as other 61 Discussion potential genotoxic agents in a hospital setting. This was our rational for not includ- ing all these studies in our data analyses. Rather we wanted to show the numerous articles often referred to as evidence for N 2O toxicity. Not surprisingly, without any evaluation of the quality of the studies or the certainty of the results, all six retro- spective surveys from 1971-1975, show an increased odds ratio of spontaneous abor- tion in women exposed to waste gases. Howe ver, only two of ten of the studies from 1977-2015 showed the same effect. We sugg ests this to be due to increased aware- ness of the toxicity of anaesthetic waste ga ses and hence, also better ventilation or other types of reduction of waste ga ses, as for example mask design. For blood-sample based tests, new and emer ging methods have given the possibility to test genotoxicity and it will be interest ing to see more studies to reveal the mecha- nism behind the toxicity of waste anaest hetic gases to understand potential long- term effects. N2O, a better choice? We were not able to present solid results favouring N 2O over other active drugs or even placebo for neither satisfaction nor pain although, based on the presented re- sults, we have reason to believe that N 2O is as good as the established analgesics. However, the results (from 5 studies) showed that the patients in the N 2O group needed shorter recovery time than when ot her active drugs were used. Further, alt- hough not documented in this report, shorter preparation time is expected in that the onset of effect is immediate, compared to for example EMLA which needs an on- set time of 30 minutes. Total sedation time may therefore be the most important single advantage of N 2O. In accordance with the resu lts shown in this report that personnel or patients were more satisfied with N 2O sedation than no sedation, nurses using N 2O for short procedures in Norway re ports that the method is well ap- preciated by children who come repetitively for treatments which are painful. Happy children and parents also reduces the stress of health care pers onnel and should not be underestimated. Also, all studies on safe ty for health personnel included in this review are taken from either dental settings, operating theatres or maternity wards, suggesting an everyday, continuous exposure to N 2O. Using N 2O as sedation in chil- dren for small hospital procedures, the exposure will probably be a few times a week, each lasting for a maximum of 30 minutes (personal communicatio n). This level of exposure will be far below any of the studies reporting adverse effects of N 2O. 62 Conclusion Conclusion The results show that nitrous oxide can be us ed for sedation of children without seri- ous adverse events. The most noticeable advantage by using N 2O is the short restitu- tion compared to other sedation metho ds which shortens the whole procedure and may streamline hospital procedures in children. The present Health Technology Assessment shows that midwives and dental person- nel exposed to N 2O compared to no exposure, did not increase the risk of spontaneous abortion or, at low exposure, reduced fertility. High expo sure showed reduced fertil- ity. The risk for congenital abnormalities born by exposed mothers (concentration or exposure degree not known) was higher than in non-exposed mothers. It is important to understand that these results are generate d from data based on self-reporting ques- tionnaires. Also, information about level of exposure was inadequate. No sufficient evidence was shown to draw conclusions of the toxic effect of N 2O on DNA or cellular mechanisms. There were no studies on negative effects on reproductive health for health personnel in a setting where N 2O was used for sedation of children for small hospital procedures. The personnel included in the present studies, were expected to have a more or less continuous exposure to N 2O during their work hours. For personnel working with N 2O sedation of children for small hospital proc edures the exposure is expected to be sig- nificantly lower than the health care work ers in the studies where toxic effects were reported, justified by two reasons. First, the concentration of N 2O is expected to be lower because the access to better scaven ging and ventilation systems; and second, the net exposure time would be lower as the procedure time (maximum 30 minutes per procedure) and the number for the hospital procedures per health worker per week would be relatively fe w (personal communication). 63 References References 1.

The scale includes behavioural and verbal measures of pain. Score: 1-13, where 13 is the most intense pain. In some papers 4< is considered without pain, while others use <6 as the limit. (73) FLACC/ LLANTO FLACC: Face, Legs, Activity , Cry, Consolability. A measurement used to assess pain for children between the ages of 2 months and 7 years or individuals that are unable to communicate their pain. LLANTO: Spanish version of an observational pain scale using observation of crying, attitude, respiratory pattern, muscle tone and facial expression. Score for each of the criteria: 0-2, giving a total of 10 points. Higher score, higher distress/pain. (74) 73 Appendix Wong Baker Faces Pain Scale Infant Pain Profile. A multidimensional composite pain score develo ped and validated in clini- cal settings used for evaluating acute procedural pain in preterm neonates. It measures seven different ele-ments including physiological parameters, facial ex- pression, behaviour and gestational age. Scale for each elements: 0-3 giving a total of 21 points, where 21 is the maximum pain. (76) For procedure satisfaction OSBD-R Observational Scale of Behavioural Distress-Revised. The scale includes 8 behaviours (information seeking, cry, scream, restraint, verb al resistance, emotional sup- port, verbal pain, and flail). Score: each behaviour is scored from 0 to 23.

Description of system atic reviews on children under- going N 2O sedation Study Description Migita 2006 (20) The objective was to assess the safety and efficacy of various forms of analgesia and se- dation for fracture reduction in paediatric patients in the emergency department. Two of the eight randomised controlled trials included in the systematic review presented data on N 2O. Results on N 2O were judged too limited to support effectiveness or safety. Rao 2012 (78) The objective was to assess reducti on of distress, pain or anxiety for children undergoing voiding cystourethrograhy using various forms of interventions. One of the eight randomised controlled trials included in the systematic review presented data on N 2O and only a narrative presented the data concluding that further evidence for the efficiency of N 2O is needed. Ara\u00fajo 2015 (22) The objective was to assess the use of N 2O to decrease pain intensity during hospital pro- cedures in children. Two randomized controlled trials were included in the systematic review and a narrative presented the data concluding that there were insufficient amount of data to conclude about the efficacy of N 2O to reduce pain. Viana 2017 (23) The objective was to assess the evidence for the amnestic effects of various sedatives in children. Seven of the 54 included studies presented data on N 2O. A narrative presentation of ben- zodiazepines compared to, among others, N 2O, showed that anterograde amnesia was likely with benzodiazepines than with N 2O (one study). 96 Appendix Appendix 6.

Characteristics and outcomes of the in cluded studies on health personnel exposed to N 2O See Appendix 8. Summary of occupational safety with uncertain exposure to N 2O N2O is a common component in general anaesthesia and many of the in cluded studies on our search for occupational exposure to N 2O (58 articles) were from hospital setting where the health personnel were expo sed to anaesthetic waste gases th rough their work in operation t heatres. In these studies, the role of N 2O was unclear and not analysed separately. We here show a shor t summary for the effect of anaesthetic gases on selected out- comes. Reproducibility: We found 20 articles with effect of anaesthetic wa ste gases on different aspects of reproducibility ( Table 17 ). Of these, only 3 articles mentioned N 2O as a possible part of the anaesthetic gases. DNA damage and cellular functions: We found 20 articles with effect of anaesthetic waste gases on DNA damage and cellular functions ( Table 18). All mentioned N 2O as a part of the gases exposed to the personnel. Neurobehaviour: We found 6 articles studying the neurob ehavioral effect of anaesthetic gases ( Table 19 ). Five of them mentioned N 2O as one of the gases. Liver and kidney function: We found 7 articles that studied the effect of anae sthetic gases on organ (liver and kidney) function ( Table 20 ). All but two of these mentioned N 2O as a part of the gases exposed to the personnel. Haematological and infl ammatory parameters: We found 4 articles studying haematological and inflammatory parameters ( Table 21 ). All of these mentioned N 2O as a part of the gases exposed to the personnel. Other outcomes than these mention above: There were 5 articles presenting data on other outcomes from those mentioned above ( Table 22 ). Two of them mentioned N 2O as a part of the exposure gases and the three othe rs only mentioned exposure to anaesthetic gases. The studies which mentioned N 2O did not present any specific data on this gas. Table 17 .

The nurses working in operating rooms often had a hard irregular workload, as well as night duty. In the present study, it was tempting for the nurses to blame x-ray and halothane for their miscarriages, but there were no differences between the mean exposure to these two pol-lutants in the nurses having miscarriages and in the corresponding groups having full-time pregnancies.

Summary of occupational safety with uncertain exposure to N 2O N2O is a common component in general anaesthesia and many of the in cluded studies on our search for occupational exposure to N 2O (58 articles) were from hospital setting where the health personnel were expo sed to anaesthetic waste gases th rough their work in operation t heatres. In these studies, the role of N 2O was unclear and not analysed separately. We here show a shor t summary for the effect of anaesthetic gases on selected out- comes. Reproducibility: We found 20 articles with effect of anaesthetic wa ste gases on different aspects of reproducibility ( Table 17 ). Of these, only 3 articles mentioned N 2O as a possible part of the anaesthetic gases. DNA damage and cellular functions: We found 20 articles with effect of anaesthetic waste gases on DNA damage and cellular functions ( Table 18). All mentioned N 2O as a part of the gases exposed to the personnel. Neurobehaviour: We found 6 articles studying the neurob ehavioral effect of anaesthetic gases ( Table 19 ). Five of them mentioned N 2O as one of the gases. Liver and kidney function: We found 7 articles that studied the effect of anae sthetic gases on organ (liver and kidney) function ( Table 20 ). All but two of these mentioned N 2O as a part of the gases exposed to the personnel. Haematological and infl ammatory parameters: We found 4 articles studying haematological and inflammatory parameters ( Table 21 ). All of these mentioned N 2O as a part of the gases exposed to the personnel. Other outcomes than these mention above: There were 5 articles presenting data on other outcomes from those mentioned above ( Table 22 ). Two of them mentioned N 2O as a part of the exposure gases and the three othe rs only mentioned exposure to anaesthetic gases. The studies which mentioned N 2O did not present any specific data on this gas. Table 17 .
