Risks and Side Effects Other Considerations Johnce / Getty Images Ayurveda, or Ayurvedic medicine, is a traditional medical system that uses a holistic approach to improve physical and mental health. It originated in India in the 2nd century BC and is still widely used there. Ayurvedic medicine focuses on restoring the balance between a person's mind, body, spirit, and environment. Treatment involves a personalized plan that includes diet, movement, massage, herbs, and other therapies. In the United States, Ayurveda is considered a complementary or alternative health approach. It might offer some benefits, but more research is needed to determine its effectiveness for specific conditions, as well as the safety of products that might contain potentially toxic ingredients. Principles of Ayurveda The word \"Ayurveda\" is derived from the Sanskrit word Ayu (life) and Veda (knowledge or science). Ayurveda centers around the idea that imbalance leads to illness. According to Ayurveda, the universe is made of five elements: Jala (water)Vayu (air)Prithvi (earth)Aakash (space)Teja (fire) These elements combine to form three energy types in the human body: Pitta dosha (air and space), Vata dosha (water and fire), and Kapha dosha (earth and water). Together, these Tridoshas help regulate how the body functions. In Ayurveda, the body is comprised of seven types of tissues known as Sapta Dhatus. These marrow)Shukra (reproductive tissue)Asthi (bone tissue) Tri Malas and Agni are other important elements in Ayurveda. Tri Malas involves three types of waste products: sweat, urine, and feces. Agni represents the biological fire that helps carry out metabolic processes. Imbalances in either Tri Malas or Agni can lead to a variety of conditions including digestive issues and skin irritation. The Three Doshas Each dosha is associated with specific physical qualities, personality traits, and emotional strengths and weaknesses. Every person has a combination of all three doshas, but one or two doshas are usually dominant. Vata Dosha Vata dosha consists of the elements air and space (also called ether). Vata qualities include cold, light, dry, subtle, and rough. People with strong vata tend to be creative, lighthearted, energetic, and flexible decision-makers. They often have a more delicate build and speak more quickly than other doshas. Vata involves processes that are responsible for cell signaling and division, electrolyte imbalance, waste elimination, movement, and cognition. Pitta Dosha Pitta dosha consists of the elements fire and water. Pitta qualities include hot, liquid, sharp, and pungent. People with strong pitta tend to be strong-willed, direct, and fierce with opponents. They often have a medium, more muscular build. Pitta involves processes responsible for metabolism, digestion, vision, and temperature regulation. Kapha Dosha Kapha dosha consists of the elements water and earth. Kapha qualities include soft, cold, stable, and heavy. People with strong kapha tend to be calm, loving, and caring. They often have a strong build and move more slowly than other doshas. Kapha involves joint lubrication, processes for storage and stability, and maintenance and growth of body structures. Ayurvedic Diet Ayurveda believes that diet affects your genetic constitution (Prakriti) and supports healing processes. Diet also affects the three doshas. Ayurvedic medicine includes following a diet that helps bring your predominant dosha into greater balance with your other doshas. For example, Vata is light, rough, and cold. Eating heavy, smooth, and warm foods can help bring a Vata person into greater balance. Here are some diet recommendations based on predominant doshas: Vata: Eat foods that are fresh, warm, and heavy with sweet, sour, or salty tastes. Avoid bitter and astringent foods that leave a drying sensation in your mouth, like apples or unripe bananas. Too much fasting leads to greater Vata imbalance. Pitta: Eat foods that are hot, less oily, and light. Avoid sour or salty foods, as well as canned foods, vegetable oils, instant foods, coffee, and vinegar. A mostly vegetarian diet helps balance Pitta. Kapha: Eat warm and light foods with a bitter or astringent taste. Avoid sweet, sour, or salty foods, as well as frozen foods and cold water. A lower-carbohydrate and lower-fat diet supports Kapha. The 12 Best Herbs and Spices for Better Health Ayurvedic Treatment Ayurveda focuses on personalized treatments to prevent illness and disease, as well as reduce symptoms. Ayurvedic practitioners will ask questions about your diet, lifestyle, medical history, environmental conditions, dosha characteristics, and general health status to help determine whether you're experiencing any imbalances or possible symptoms. They will then suggest a treatment approach that aligns with your health condition and imbalances. Ayurvedic medicine includes Panchakarma, a treatment method that cleanses and rejuvenates the body and promotes longevity. The steps include: Preparing the body for the treatmentMain treatmentProcedures to return the body to its normal state Ayurvedic treatment options include herbs, dietary changes, detoxification, Ayurvedic massage (which uses warm herbal oils), meditation, and yoga. Does Ayurveda Work? Several clinical trials and systematic reviews suggest that Ayurveda can be effective, particularly the herbs and supplements used in treatment. For example, one clinical trial of 440 people with knee osteoarthritis found that Ayurvedic preparations of plant extracts reduced pain and improved function as well as the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug Celebrex (celecoxib). Ayurvedic herbs such as black cumin, garlic, and guggul have been reported to moderately improve hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol). Research often focuses on particular elements of Ayurveda, like specific herbs, yoga, or massage. Other potential benefits of Ayurvedic medicine include: Reducing raised cortisol levels, which is one of the effects of stress Supporting a healthy immune system Improving cognitive function Improving sleep quality and efficiency Ayurveda still lacks sufficient scientific evidence. There's also great variability within Ayurveda\u2014for example, in the components and dosage of different preparations. Larger, more rigorous studies that monitor participants for longer periods of time could help determine potential benefits of Ayurvedic treatment approaches for different conditions. Possible Risks and Side Effects Ayurveda is most often well tolerated. However, there are some potential risks. Some herbs can lead to gastrointestinal side effects such as: Diarrhea Constipation Nausea Vomiting Heartburn More severe side effects include: Ulcer (painful sore on the lining of the stomach or lower intestine) Kidney disease Bradycardia (low heart rate) Hypotension (low blood pressure) Infertility Some commonly used herbs are contraindicated for certain conditions. For example, curcumin (turmeric) slows blood clotting, so it can worsen some bleeding conditions. More research is needed to determine the safety of Ayurvedic treatments during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as well as for children. The origin of the product is not always clear, and some products might be harmful. Drug Interactions Herbs used in Ayurveda might interact with medications. Here are a few herbs commonly used in Ayurveda and possible interactions: Ashwagandha: Diabetes medications, immunosuppressants (medications that reduce your body's immune response), anticonvulsants (anti-seizure medications), and thyroid hormone medications Ginger: Anticoagulants (blood thinners) like aspirin, Coumadin (warfarin), and heparin (brand names include Lovenoz and Fragmin) Holy basil: Thyroid hormone medications, anticoagulation drugs, and antiplatelet drugs (medications that prevent blood clots) Always consult with a licensed healthcare provider before taking any Ayurvedic herbs. Heavy Metal Poisoning Some Ayurvedic supplements contain heavy metals like lead, mercury, or arsenic. One meta-review of 220 case reports and series found that most participants had elevated levels of heavy metals. Many people had levels of heavy metals above the permissible limit per the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO). Another small study of people who use Ayurvedic supplements found elevated blood levels of lead in 40% of participants. About 25% of the preparations exceeded the recommended maximum level of lead and about 50% exceeded the recommended maximum level of mercury. Other Considerations Ayurvedic practice or study has no significant regulation in the United States. Practitioners are not required to have licenses. Like other supplements, Ayurvedic preparations are not regulated by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) The effects of these products vary from person to person and depend on many variables, including type, dosage, frequency of use, and interactions with current medications. Always speak with a licensed healthcare provider or pharmacist before starting any supplements, especially if you're pregnant, have a medical condition, or are taking any medications. A Quick Review Ayurveda is one of the oldest medical systems. It originated in India and is still widely used there. Ayurvedic medicine focuses on holistic approaches that promote health by balancing the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurvedic treatment involves dietary changes, herbs, massage, yoga, and meditation. These treatment components have many potential benefits. However, more research is needed to determine how Ayurveda might affect specific symptoms and conditions. Possible risks include side effects of herbs, drug interactions, and heavy metal poisoning. It's important to talk to your healthcare provider before trying Ayurveda.
