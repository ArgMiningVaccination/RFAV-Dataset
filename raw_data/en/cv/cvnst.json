It's exhausting. We may have felt under psychic attack (when negative energy such as ill wishes, jealousy or hatred is directed toward you), or you may have been pulled into drama at the workplace or friend group that left you drained. When we experience negativity, it makes us vulnerable, disrupts our sense of self, and makes those around us miserable. Negativity can also come from within ourselves - our thoughts, emotions and bad habits can be our worst enemy. Luckily, crystals can help bring us back to the centre. Their powerful healing properties can attract positivity, cultivate a higher vibration and shake off unwanted energy from your aura. They can balance and protect our sacred energy while strengthening our energetic force field. These gifts from Mother Earth can be incorporated into the home to prevent bad vibes from entering or carried with you as a protective talisman to deflect anything that does not align with your vibe. Most importantly, they can offer stability, inner strength and the confidence to tackle negative people or situations that threaten your zen. Here are five of the most effective crystals for warding off negativity. Black obsidian forwarding off negativity This mystical stone is revered by healers and shamans the world over. It's a stone associated with purification, transformation and metamorphosis. A black volcanic glass, obsidian calls on us to unleash our inner power just like its explosive origins. It blocks geopathic stress and counters psychic attacks (ill wishes, jealousy or any negative energy sent toward you), then directs it back to the sender. Its truth-enhancing qualities expose negativity and bring to light your negative patterns. Nothing can be hidden from obsidian - making it an effective crystal for deep, soul healing self-reflection. Use it as a tool to release unhealthy attachments, cut ties with toxic energy and people that do not serve you. Since obsidian always absorbs negative energy, it needs regular cleansing. How to use it Carry black obsidian with you to guard against energy vampires - it's especially useful when entering new environments or meeting new people. Work with black obsidian when you want to cut emotional ties or attachment by place a piece on your front door and by entryways to stop unwanted energies from entering your space.

Amethyst for emotional protection Amethyst is a protective stone known for its strong cleansing powers and meditative properties. This semi-precious gemstone has long been associated with protection.
