We will review a number of highly effective supplements for alcoholics that include many basic vitamins and go well beyond them. Years ago, I had alcohol cravings that were so bad that I wondered if they would be a permanent part of my life. I began to research the subject of natural alcohol detox. I discovered that quality supplements can significantly alleviate alcohol withdrawal. I read every book that I could find on the subject of alcohol withdrawal supplements. I experimented with dozens of supplements for alcohol withdrawal, most of them ordered from reputable companies through Amazon.com. I did all of this while training clients in the gym who were unaware of this real passion, but who often benefited from my newfound expertise in nutrition and mental health. Acute alcohol withdrawal occurs when alcoholics stop drinking. Symptoms can include: - Intense anxiety (for me, a sense of impending doom) - Intense insomnia - Crippling depression - Seizures (in extreme cases) While acute alcohol withdrawal typically ends within a week, post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS) can last for up to a year. Symptoms are typically less extreme variations of acute withdrawal symptoms: - General anxiety and depression - Lack of motivation (or a sense of blah!) - Mood swings - Inability to focus These symptoms often lead alcoholics right back to the bottle. Through independent research, I have identified a number of supplements for alcohol detox and withdrawal that actually work to relieve these symptoms. Whether you've just quit drinking or you're struggling with symptoms of PAWS, this list of supplements and vitamins for alcohol withdrawal can seriously change your life for the better.

Because alcohol depletes so many important nutrients from the body, the root causes of alcohol withdrawal symptoms are often nutrient deficiencies that have built up over time. Many people suffer needlessly and even relapse because they do not know about the benefits of even the most rudimentary vitamins for alcohol withdrawal. No amount of positive thinking, group therapy, or spiritual guidance can help when the cause of your problem is physiological. Unfortunately, the average multivitamin is not enough to put an end to alcohol withdrawals. I found relief over time, gradually, and I tried many supplements that did not work. The process was worthwhile because every now and then, I would discover a miracle supplement that would catapult my sense of well-being to new heights. Supplements for alcohol detox and recovery fall into six categories: - Anti-anxiety agents - Vitamins - Minerals - EFAs (essential fatty acids) - Amino Acids - Herbs Rest assured that there are compounds from each of these categories that work incredibly well for alleviating alcohol withdrawals and restoring healthy body chemistry. These supplements do not need to be taken indefinitely. In my experience, my nutritional deficiencies were resolved after one to three months of supplementation. Whether you've suffered from alcohol withdrawals or you're trying to help someone else, you'll want to become familiar with the alcohol withdrawal vitamins and supplements listed below. For a basic understanding of how nutrient repair for alcohol addiction works, check out my in-depth video below and be sure to read the rest of this article!

This lack of vitamins and minerals can make alcohol recovery more difficult with worsened withdrawal symptoms. To make alcohol withdrawal and detox easier, we recommend taking: [Multi-nutrient support formulas](https://fitrecovery.com/organic-supplement-helps-to-restore-mental-tranquility-and-motivation/) Why do I recommend these? In a related article, I share why these are the best [ vitamins and minerals for alcohol detox](https://fitrecovery.com/best-minerals-and-vitamins-for-alcohol-detox/) as well as some signs of deficiency. Fatty Acids and Amino Acids The neurotransmitters in your brain produce dopamine to help you \"feel good\", however alcohol consumption interrupts these neurotransmitters. Unfortunately, regular consumption means addicts require drinking in order to feel good, although the feeling isn't sustainable. The good news is that, over time, you can repair your liver, regulate amino acids and retrain your brain to produce dopamine. There are certain fatty and amino acids that I found useful in my alcohol recovery: - Omega-3 Oil - L-Glutamine - N-acetyl Cysteine (NAC) - L-Theanine I discuss the benefits of these 7 [fatty acids and amino acids for alcohol detox](https://fitrecovery.com/amino-acids-alcohol-detox/) in much more detail in a related article. Natural Compounds Alcohol abuse is a direct abuse of your liver and is the leading cause of liver disease in the U.S. But there's hope, even after years of abuse because your liver has the fascinating ability to regenerate itself over time.

Herbal Supplements Although herbal alcohol detox isn't a new concept, it hasn't been widely accepted in the West as many experts and medical professionals turned to the use of pharmaceuticals for alcohol withdrawal. Fortunately, there are studies being conducted and Ayurvedic professionals recommend the use of herbal remedies for alcohol detox. The following herbs have been recommended: - Ashwagandha - DHM (dihydromyricetin) - Milk Thistle - Mucuna Pruriens - Passion Flower Here's everything you need to know about using [herbal supplements for alcohol withdrawal](https://fitrecovery.com/herbal-supplements-for-alcohol-withdrawal/). Scientific Research Research has shown that there are major benefits to using alcohol withdrawal vitamins and few studies on the results of using herbs for alcohol withdrawals and recovery. I can vouch for their efficacy, as can many other people. More research is clearly needed! 2021 Update: The past few years have brought the research I called for years ago, with studies now vindicating CBD, DHM, and milk thistle. Benzodiazepines For Alcohol Withdrawal [Benzodiazepines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) are anti-anxiety and anticonvulsant drugs that must be prescribed by doctors. They are often a necessary part of detox for people who have been drinking very heavily for months or years. Benzodiazepines activate a neurotransmitter called GABA (gamma amino butyric acid), preventing seizures that can arise as fatal complications of alcohol withdrawals. Although I'm a strong supporter of using supplementation for natural alcohol detox, I mention benzodiazepines here for three reasons: - Ativan saved me from potentially life-threatening withdrawals - I easily tapered off of Ativan under a doctor's supervision - You may be able to obtain a prescription to detox without expensive treatment Learn more about the role of [benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal](https://fitrecovery.com/benzodiazepines-alcohol-withdrawal/).

People often ask me if I still take all of the supplements I've written about. The answer is that I only take supplements as needed. I have a medicine cabinet filled with the aforementioned supplements, and it feels good to know that I have them just in case I need them. Sometimes, I'll take passion flower or L-theanine to help me get to sleep. Other times, I'll take ashwagandha or rhodiola rosea to help balance my system during a stressful day. I've found that if I need an extra mental boost to stay up and finish some work, mucuna pruriens does the trick. Everyone's biochemistry is different. I know which supplements work for me as tools, buffers, or lines of defense against stress, insomnia, and poor health. Figuring out which ones worked best for me was an empowering process of self-discovery, and the same will be true for you. I often take DLPA before busy mornings - it is probably my favorite supplement on this list. One of my coaching clients recently told me that this amino acid worked instantly for him, staving off a panic attack at work.
