The objective of this study was to assess the vaccination uptake and its associated factors in siblings of children with developmental delay. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2017 to February 2018. The families of children with developmental delay, according to evaluation by a psychiatrist per ICD-10 criteria, were recruited from 3 child development centers. The data were collected using a semistructured questionnaire. Results: 189 families with children with developmental delay were recruited into the study. In total, these children had 114 typically developing elder siblings and 50 typically developing younger siblings. The proportions of overall complete vaccination among the children with developmental delay group and the younger sibling group were significantly lower than the older sibling group (P < .01). The proportions of MMR (mumps, measles, and rubella) vaccination among the children with developmental delay group and the younger sibling group were significantly lower than the older sibling group (P < .001). Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that reduced vaccination uptake is a general trend in families of children with developmental delay. Such a significant decline in the vaccination rate in this group of children will make them vulnerable if outbreaks occur. Therefore, public health strategies targeted to improve vaccination rates in families of children with developmental delay are needed.", "sitename": "The Primary Care Companion", "date": "2022-07-12", "cleaned_text": "[click](#) Hello Pop Baclofen, a French Exception, Seriously Harms Alcohol Use Disorder Patients Without Benefit To the Editor: Dr Andrade's analysis of the Bacloville trial in a recent Clinical and Practical Psychopharmacology column, in which he concluded that \"individualized treatment with high-dose baclofen (30-300 mg/d) may be a useful second-line approach in heavy drinkers\" and that \"baclofen may be particularly useful in patients with liver disease,\" deserves comment.1 First, Andrade failed to recall that the first pivotal trial of baclofen, ALPADIR (NCT01738282; 320 patients, as with Bacloville), was negative (see Braillon et al2). Second, Dr Andrade should have warned readers that Bacloville's results are most questionable, lacking robustness. Although he cited us,3 he overlooked the evidence we provided indicating that the Bacloville article4 was published without acknowledging major changes to the initial protocol, affecting the primary outcome. Coincidentally (although as skeptics, we do not believe in coincidence), the initial statistical team was changed when data were sold to the French pharmaceutical company applying for the marketing authorization in France.
