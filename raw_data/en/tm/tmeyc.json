It's important to remember that being well is not the absence of illness or stress. Rather, wellness is the active process of being aware of living a healthy and fulfilling life. Just as you develop habits to keep yourself physically healthy, you can develop habits that improve your mental wellness. Mental and physical wellness are linked to each other in many important ways and should be viewed as skills that need to be developed and repeated in a balanced way. However, for rural communities achieving this balance can be difficult due to isolation or challenges in accessing mental health providers and health care. In addition, the many uncertainties of farming can create added stress and financial difficulties. There also can be a perception that working 16 hours a day is necessary to demonstrate a strong work ethic. This can lead to stress, burnout, and not living a healthy and balanced life. So how can you begin taking time to bring balance to your physical and mental wellness? Following are five steps to help you become both physically and mentally healthy while bringing more balance into your life. 1. Exercise The key is to find the right type of exercise for you - whether that means joining a casual sports team, going for walks with a friend or a pet, or doing yoga from the comfort of your own home. Physical activity has been shown to help clear the mind, improve self-worth, and reduce depressive and anxious feelings. You can learn more about the [recommended guidelines for physical activity for different age levels](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/index.htm) at this Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. 2. Sleep We once thought that poor sleeping habits were caused by mental health disorders, but more recent research suggests poor sleep can be the cause of mental health problems or make them worse. Following a healthy bedtime routine could make you feel happier and calmer and be better focused throughout the day.

Nutrition Cut down on sugary foods and replace them with nutrient-rich foods like fish, veggies, and foods that have healthy fats such as avocados. These habits have been shown to reduce depressive symptoms in adults. 4. Community and Relationships Whether the support comes from family, a partner, friends, coworkers, or even pets, feeling connected to those around you can increase a sense of purpose and love in your life. Identify ways to create community. 5. Relaxation and Recreation In our busy lives it can be easy to forget about the hobbies you used to love, or to make time to sit down and enjoy a book. Building in time to do the things you enjoy will give you a happier frame of mind and give you more energy to deal with difficult emotions when they arise. Ultimately, it's important to remember that mental health is closely tied to physical health. Treating them both with care and working on your overall wellness will make you feel better in a number of ways.
