Adrenal Balance contains powerful herbs that support normal hormonal balance and help a dog's body adapt to stress. Prana Pets Adrenal Balance enhances the balance among the dog's adrenal glands, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus. Since there is no cure for Cushing's, treatment has to be long-term, making this holistic method healthier and more beneficial than pharmaceutical drugs. Adrenal Balance stabilizes a dog's body rather than simply targeting symptoms; it has no side effects or risks to a dog's health. Cushing's occurs when the dog's adrenal glands overproduce cortisol, a stress hormone. When a dog is under stress, its adrenal glands will emit cortisol as a normal response to danger. If stress becomes chronic, however, cortisol is released uncontrollably at the expense of the dog's health. Anxious dogs tend to have higher stress levels, putting them at risk for Cushing's as they grow older. Typical things to look for include increased appetite and urination, excessive panting and thirst, hair loss, skin issues, low energy, enlarged abdomen, and high blood sugar. Adrenal Balance for Cushing's is a 100% herbal remedy specifically formulated to provide comprehensive, gentle support to dogs suffering from Cushing's and works well in combination with our other [dog Cushings disease natural treatment](/collections/cushings-treatment-for-dogs) options.
