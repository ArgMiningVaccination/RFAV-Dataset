We view healing as an art, tailored to each individual by harmonizing three essential components of wellness. These elements are deeply interconnected and inseparable, guiding one's path towards complete health and wellness. There are 3 components to wellness: - Wellness of the spirit - Wellness of the soul - will, mind, emotions - Wellness in the physical body This is wellness in spirit-soul-body. One of these three components will show itself to be dominant in each individual during an assessment. We look at the whole picture in the person, not just the physical symptoms. Therefore, it is important to understand all three components of wellness and identify the most immediate and primary need in order to formulate an effective plan of care. At the Center for Holistic Healing in Dallas, we understand that optimal health and wellness require a comprehensive approach. \"Wherever the art of medicine is loved, there is also a love of humanity.\" -Hippocrates Julia Schulenburg BSN, RN, ND, CLT established the Center for Holistic Healing in Dallas, TX in 2006. She is a registered nurse with a Bachelors in Science, a certified naturopathic doctor, and a certified manual lymphatic drainage and decongestive therapist. With her medical experience in allopathic medicine, acute care, and education, she is uniquely qualified to provide an integrative approach to health and wellness. Her compassion for others and a desire to help them holistically in spirit, soul, and body carries over into how she operates as an integrative practitioner with a whole person point of view. We Support You Lyme Challenges With the integration of allopathic medicine and naturopathy, the Center for Holistic Healing has developed specialized methods for helping individuals with complex variants of Lyme and its associated co-infections. They can experience relief from neurological and visual disturbances, complaints of brain fog, joint pain, ADD/ADHD - like symptoms, complaints of chronic fatigue, neuro-degenerative challenges, and intestinal discomforts. Detoxification Louis Pasteur said, \"The terrain is everything.\" We have developed unique methods of detoxification to help achieve a clean internal environment and eliminate toxic heavy metals, chemicals, pesticides, and vaccine toxins. We help individuals with genetic SNiPs who have difficulty eliminating toxins. Detoxification also helps those suffering from allergies, cancer, arthritis, auto-immune disorders, anxiety, and other inflammatory conditions. Microbial Overgrowth Toxins create an environment in the tissues that support the growth of harmful micro-organisms which stresses the immune system. Antoine Bechamp and Louis Pasteur said microbes morph inside us because of the toxic tissue - \"terrain\". Multiple strains of pathogens have also shown to be fueled by toxins and chronic exposure to toxic electro-magnetic field radiation. Hope where there is no Hope Healing where there is no Healing Based on my experience, three fundamental axioms define alternative medicine as I know it. - All illness, especially chronic illness, is caused by the presence of toxic substances. - Organisms, emotions and/or beliefs in the body. The best route to healing is to remove the toxins and reinforce the body's innate ability to eliminate them. - Every person is unique bio-chemically, electrically, emotionally and spiritually. - The body's energy field can be used to understand each person's uniqueness and to detect and eliminate the relevant toxins. -Richard F. Tozer, DBA My son had bad seasonal allergies. There was significant improvement with his allergies after Julia treated him. She's terrific! -Cindy Brinker Simmons When I came to Julia, I had been so sick for almost 9 months with diagnosed Lyme. I tried antibiotics and conventional medicine. I couldn't tolerate medicines or supplements. Almost bedridden, my parents had to move in with me and my husband to help care for our young children. About the 4th week into treatment, I was so much less sore and my muscles were not so feeble. Over the next several months, I drastically improved. It wasn't overnight, but huge improvements happened and I was able to tolerate supplements that my body needed but previously rejected. Over the next year, my health was completely restored to a \"normal life\". Sincerely, "}
