It is also made from [cellulosic feedstocks](/fuels/ethanol_feedstocks.html), such as crop residues and wood\u2014though this is not as common. U.S. ethanol plants are concentrated in the Midwest because of the proximity to corn production. Plants outside the Midwest typically receive corn by rail or use other feedstocks and are located near large population centers. Production The production method of ethanol depends on the type of feedstock used. The process is shorter for starch- or sugar-based feedstocks than with cellulosic feedstocks. Starch- and Sugar-Based Ethanol Production Most ethanol in the United States is produced from starch-based crops by dry- or wet-mill processing. Nearly 90% of ethanol plants are dry mills due to lower capital costs. Dry-milling is a process that grinds corn into flour and ferments it into ethanol with co-products of distillers grains and carbon dioxide. Wet-mill plants primarily produce corn sweeteners, along with ethanol and several other co-products (such as corn oil and starch). Wet mills separate starch, protein, and fiber in corn prior to processing these components into products, such as ethanol. Cellulosic Production Making ethanol from cellulosic feedstocks\u2014such as grass, wood, and crop residues\u2014is a more involved process than using starch-based crops. There are two primary pathways to produce cellulosic ethanol: biochemical and thermochemical. The biochemical process involves a pretreatment to release hemicellulose sugars followed by hydrolysis to break cellulose into sugars. Sugars are fermented into ethanol and lignin is recovered and used to produce energy to power the process. The thermochemical conversion process involves adding heat and chemicals to a biomass feedstock to produce syngas, which is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Syngas is mixed with a catalyst and reformed into ethanol and other liquid co-products. To read more about the conversion process, see [Process Design and Economics for Biochemical Conversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass Ethanol: Hydrolysis Stover](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/47764.pdf) Design and Economics for Biochemical Conversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass to Ethanol: Thermochemical Pathway by Indirect Gasification and Mixed Alcohol Synthesis](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/51400.pdf). Schematic of Fuel Distribution System Source: Dean Armstrong, National Renewable Energy Laboratory Distribution Most U.S. ethanol plants are concentrated in the Midwest, but gasoline consumption is highest along the East and West Coasts. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 90% of ethanol is transported by train or truck. A tanker truck can carry 8,000 to 10,000 gallons of ethanol, and one rail car can carry approximately 30,000 gallons of ethanol. The remaining 10% is mainly transported by barge, with minimal amounts transported by pipeline. The United States consumed nearly 14 billion gallons of ethanol in 2021. Ethanol, gasoline blendstock, and additives are delivered separately to fuel terminals where they are blended into fuel trucks for delivery to stations. Ethanol Pipelines Delivering ethanol by pipeline is the most efficient option, but ethanol's affinity for water and solvent properties require the use of a dedicated pipeline or significant cleanup of existing pipelines to convert them into dedicated pipelines. Kinder Morgan ships batches of ethanol through its Central Florida Pipeline. For details, see the [Central Florida "}
