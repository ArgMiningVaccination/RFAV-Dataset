Distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0).The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, a pandemic, as the coronavirus has now infected over 2.6 million people globally and caused more than 185,000 fatalitiesas of April 23, 2020. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a respiratory illness with symptoms such as drycough, fever, sudden loss of smell, and, in more severe cases, di culty breathing. To date, there is no speci c vaccine or treatment proven e ective against this viral disease. Early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is thus critical to curbing its spread and improving health outcomes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is commonly usedto detect the presence of COVID-19. Other techniques, such as recombinase polymerase ampli cation (RPA), loop- short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and microfluidics, have allowed better disease diagnosis. Here, as part of the e ort to expand screening capacity, we review advances and challenges in the rapid detection of COVID-19 by targeting nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies. We also summarize potential treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 and discuss ongoing clinical trials of interventions to reduce viral progression. 1. Introduction The recent global outbreak of COVID-19 has led to a public health emergency. As of April 23, 2020, over 2.6million con rmed cases were reported to WHO from213 countries and territories [1]. On January 30, 2020,WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as the sixth pub-lic health emergency of international concern, followingH1N1 (2009), Polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa(2014), Zika (2016), and Ebola (2019) [2]. The rapidAAAS Research Volume 2020, Article ID 6925296, 35 pages https://doi.org/10.34133/2020/6925296global expansion and rising fatalities have raised grave concerns on the viral spread across the globe. With therapid increase in the number of con rmed cases, WHO classied the global COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [3]. COVID-19 can spread fromperson-to-person and animal, and transmission of infec-tion may occur with exposure to symptomatic patientsor asymptomatic individuals. Coronaviruses (CoVs) (corona: crown-like shape) order Nidovirales in the subfamily Coronaviridae and delta- CoVs primarily infect birds [5]. Before December 2019, six types of CoVs had infected humans, including two - CoVs (HCoV-229E and four HKU1) mainly cause self-limiting upper the other two -CoVs (SARS-CoV and MERS- CoV) are mostly associated with illness[6, 7]. Full-genome sequence analysis of 2019-nCoV con-rms that a -CoV, distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [8]. Investigations reveal that 2019-nCoV shares ~80% sequence identity with SARS-CoV while maintaining identity the SARS-like CoVs (ZC45 and ZXC21) from bats [9]. A recent report suggests that a bat CoV (RatG13) is 96% identical (+ssRNA) ( kb) enclosed by 5 -cap and 3 -poly-A tail [11]. The genome size of 2019-nCoV is genome contains two regions (UTRs) on 5 - and 3 -terminals, one single long open reading frame 1ab(ORF 1ab) encoding a polyprotein and at least ve other ORFs encoding structural proteins, and eight accessory proteins (Figure 1(c)). The rst ORF (ORF 1a/b) is about two-thirds of the whole-genome length and encodes the 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16). The other one-third of the genome contains four ORFsencoding the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), andnucleocapsid (N) proteins, whereas other ORFs encodeaccessory proteins (Figure 1(b) and (c)). Most of the non-structural proteins are essential for 2019-nCoV replication, while structural proteins are responsible for virion assembly and viral infection [12, 13]. The M and E proteins arerequired in viral assembly, while the N protein involvesRNA genome assembly. The S protein, a surface-located trimeric is the primary determinant of CoV tropism, as itbinds to the membrane receptor on host cells, mediatingviral and cellular membrane fusion [14]. The S protein of2019-nCoV reportedly binds to angiotensin-convertingenzyme 2 (ACE2), a homolog of ACE on host cell mem-branes, contributing to 2019-nCoV cell invasion [15].Moreover, this particular S protein shows a higher bindinganity to ACE2 than the S protein of SARS-CoV, enabling 2019-nCoV to invade host cells more EMMPRIN, has been con rmed as another receptor for binding of the 2019-nCoV S protein,thereby mediating viral invasion [18]. The E protein is an integral membrane protein that regu- lates viral life cycles, including pathogenesis, envelope forma-tion, assembly, and budding [19-21]. Among the four structural proteins, protein E appears to have the highest antigenicity and the most signi cant potential as an immu- nogenic target, highlighting the possibility of developingprotein E-derived peptides as a 2019-nCoV vaccine [22]. Sys-temic studies of proteins S and E have inspired scientists totake creative approaches to design anti-COVID-19 drugs. Although some COVID-19 patients show no symptoms, most patients have some common symptoms such as fever,cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, sorethroat, and headache. In some severe cases, infections cancause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidneyfailure, and death. According to the WHO-China joint report [23], on average, people infected with 2019-nCoV develop mild respiratory symptoms and fever, 5-6 days after infection(mean incubation period, 5-6 days; range, 1-14 days). Peopleover 60 years of age and those with hypertension, diabetes, orcardiovascular diseases are at high risk for severe illnessand death. In comparison, children under 19 years appearto be infected minimally by 2019-nCoV (around 2.4% ofall reported cases). Based on the Chinese Center forDisease Control and Prevention (China CDC) report(from 72,314 patient records, dated 11 February 2020),among the con rmed cases, 86.6% of patients are 30-79 years of age, 80.9% of patients have mild-to-moderate disease, 13.8% have a severe illness, and 6.1% are critically ill [24]. Notably, the mortality rate of children under 19years is 0.2%, while people aged over 80 years have thehighest mortality rate of 14.8%. Currently, there are no e ective antiviral drugs or speci c vaccines against COVID-19. Thus, there is an urgent need forrapid detection to prevent further spread, to reduce the inten-sity of the pandemic, and to slow the increase in cases.Recently, several new technologies, including LAMP-LFA,RPA-LFA, RPA-CRISPR, and other nanomaterial-basedIgG/IgM kits, have been adopted for 2019-nCoV detection.A signi cant number of drug candidates, including chemical drugs, biological drugs, nutritional interventions, and tradi-tional Chinese medicine (TCM), have been proposed forclinical trials after the 2019-nCoV outbreak. In this review,we concentrate on the most signi cant developments in 2019-nCoV detection and provide an overview of medicaltreatments and vaccines currently in development to combatand contain the disease. 2. 2019-nCoV Detection According to the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID -19(7thedition), COVID-19 cases can be divided into suspected cases and con rmed cases [25]. Diagnostic methods for 2019-nCoV are determined by the intrinsic2 Researchproperties of the virus and biomarkers that hosts exhibit after infection. These biomarkers include viral proteins andnucleic acids, as well as antibodies induced in response to viral infection. The most common 2019-nCoV detection methods include viral nucleic acid detection and serum anti-body (IgG or IgM) detection. A con rmed case should have at least one of the following criteria: (i) a positive result for2019-nCoV nucleic acid, using real-time PCR tests fromrespiratory or blood samples; (ii) a high homogeneitybetween viral gene sequencing from respiratory or bloodsamples and known 2019-nCoV; and (iii) serum samplespositive for IgM or IgG to 2019-nCoV, or seroconversion inIgG, or a fourfold or more signi cant increase in IgG anti- body titer to 2019-nCoV in the recovery phase than in theacute phase [25]. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology contains various strategies that depend on a combination of library preparation, sequencing and mapping, genome align- ment, and data analysis [26] pro ling (RNA-seq) dis- ease mapping, and population genetic studies. The whole-genome nucleotide sequence of 2019-nCoV was identi ed and compared with the full-length genome sequence of coro-navirus from bats [10] through HTS. HTS-based technologyis also applied to detect 2019-nCoV. For example, Wang et al.developed a HTS method based on nanopore target sequenc-ing (NTS) by harnessing the bene tivity (100-fold) than standard qPCR, simultaneously withother respiratory viruses within 6-10 h. Moreover, all tar-geted regions can be identi ed by NTS in higher copies of samples (1000-3000 copies/mL) within 10 min, indicatingthe potential for rapid detection of an outbreak in the clinic. For 1 h sequencing data, reads mapped to 2019-nCoV dif- fered remarkably from those of negative controls in all tar-geted regions at concentrations ranging from 10 to 3000copies/mL. Importantly, NTS can identify mutated nucleicacids. However, the NTS platform cannot readily detecthighly degraded nucleic acid fragments that are less than200 base pairs in length [29]. Moreover, the strategy requirestedious sample preparation and lengthy turnaround time. Although HTS technology provides fast, low-cost DNA sequencing, it is not suitable for detection in clinics.

Positive results indicate infectionwith 2019-nCoV. RT-PCR is an advanced technique forcoronavirus detection because of its optimized sensitivity,specicity, and simplicity for quantitative assay [31, 32]. It provides accurate and reliable identi cation for con rmed and suspected cases. There are many commercial 2019-nCoV detecting kits with oligonucleotide primers and probes(SYBR chemistries) for N gene and ORF 1a- b/E/ORF 1b/S gene). This strategy usually requires four steps: sample collection (respiratory swabs), sample preparation (RNA isolation), one-step qRT-PCR, and data analysis (Figure 2(b)) [33]. The evaluation procedure typically lasts4-6 h. Recently, Roche (Indiana, USA) developed test systems: cobas\u00ae 6800 testing patient samples by the USFDA), which can process up to 384 results and 1056 resultsin an 8-hour shift, respectively [34]. The tests produce resultsin about 3.5 h and can process up to 4128 results in 24 h,boosting screening capacity to help restrain the sudden grow-ing epidemic in the USA. RT-PCR is widely applicable to2019-nCoV detection in the clinic, but limitations of this technology are obvious, such as high false-negative rate and low sensitivity. False-negative results may occur due to thefollowing factors: rst, mutations in the primers and probe- target regions in the 2019-nCoV genome [32]; second, lowviral load present in test specimens, improper extraction ofnucleic acid from clinical samples, or inappropriate restric-tions on sample collection, transportation, or handling [31].Real-time RT-PCR has been adopted as the gold standarddiagnostic approach for 2019-nCoV worldwide. However,RT-PCR is time-consuming (4-6 h) and requires well- equipped laboratories and skilled technicians, thereby limit- ing full deployment in developing countries. 2.1.3. cation technology has been developed to eliminate the need for a high-precision instrument in RT-PCR assays. This approach can amplifyDNA at isothermal conditions thermocycler [35].There are isothermal NASBA and TMA assays, input RNA is converted to a double-stranded DNAintermediate with a promoter region. Detection of RNA usingDNA polymerase-based ampli cation requires a reverse tran- scriptase step. LAMP and RPA do not require thermal orchemical melting with the aid of enzymes. Combined with avisual detection platform, such as a lateral flow assay (LFA) or organic dyes, LAMP and RPA have been widely employedin viral detection kits. LAMP is a rapid, one-step ampli cation technique that amplies nucleic acids with high sensitivity and speci city at an optimal temperature of 65 \u00b0C [37]. LAMP processing comprises three steps: an initial step, a cycling ampli cation step, and an elongation step (Figure 3(a)).

(a) Four technology. (b) Steps for real-time RT-PCR analysis.4 Researchstructures that promote new DNA synthesis using a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. The two innerprimers (FIP, BIP) (LF, LB), create multiple sitesin the growing DNA products, enabling rapid ampli cation. LAMP is also highly speci c since the ampli cation reaction occurs only when the primers correctly recognize all six regions. A reverse transcriptase step is included in the LAMP reaction to allow RNA targets to be detected [38]. RT-LAMP o ers improved sensitivity and speci city in real-time RT-PCR [39 -41]. Recently, Yu et al. used a commercial LAMP kit to amplify fragmentedORF 1abgenes of 2019-nCoV (Figure 3(b) and (c)) [42]. They optimized the LAMP system through incubation at 65 \u00b0C for dierent periods using a 2019-nCoV-positive RNA sample as the template. Results require a 15 min reaction time at 65\u00b0C, and detection sensitivity is comparable to that of the TaqMan-based qPCR approach (10 copies). RT-LAMP employs two additional protocols for 2019-nCoV RNAdetection. Park et al. performed RT-LAMP at 65 \u00b0C for40 min to identify the nsp3, S, and N genes of 2019-nCoVusing colorimetric detection [43]. The sensitivity of thisRT-LAMP assay was 100 copies of 2019-nCoV RNA. Theother RT-LAMP protocol was conducted at 63 \u00b0C for 30 min to detect the ORF 1ab, E, and N genes simultaneously [44]. The results con rmed the speci c nature of ORF 1aband the high sensitivity of the N gene. Based on an analysis of 208 clinical specimens, the sensitivity of this RT-LAMP was similar to conventional RT-PCR, and the speci city was 99%. Interestingly, EI-Tholoth et al. designed a two-stage iso-thermal ampli cation procedure by combining RPA (37 \u00b0C) with LAMP (63\u00b0C) to detect synthesized DNA fragments of 2019-nCoV [45]. The test was performed in closed tubeswithin 1 h using either fluorescence or colorimetric detection. This method has a sensitivity of 100 times better than con-ventional LAMP and RT-PCR, suggesting a rapid, sensitive,point-of-care test for use at home. RPA is an isothermal DNA ampli cation method that utilizes a speci c combination of enzymes and proteins (recombinase, single-strand binding (SSB) protein, andstrand-displacing DNA backward inner primer BIPBst DNA polymerasedNTP, Mg2+ Step 2: F1F1C 5' control SARS-CoV-2 Negative Bsu initiates polymerization Step 4: parental recombinase binds primersFIP BIP e primers Reco mbinas Step 2: SSB ds stran d Step 3: Bsu tiates pol ymerizat ion Step 4: tal strand splaced elongation contin ues Step 1: Figure 3: Isothermal ampli cation of nucleic acids for detecting 2019-nCoV.

Adapted and copyright with permission (b, c) [42], medRxiv.5 Researchrapidly at a constant low temperature between 25 and 42\u00b0Ci n as little as 15 min [46]. RPA usually requires four steps to achieve DNA ampli cation: formation of a recombinase- primer complex, strand invasion, D-loop formation (stabi-lized by SSB, DNA polymerization through the use DNA polymerase), and DNA ampli cation (Figure 3(d)) [47]. Results of RPA can be detected by agarosegel electrophoresis, quantitatively measured using Twis-tAmp probes, or simply applied in lateral flow assays. Apart from DNA target ampli cation, RPA formats have been developed for the detection of RNA targets (RT-RPA) by adding a reverse transcriptase enzyme to reaction mixtures [48]. Because RPA- (RT-RPA-) based detection achievesmore rapid and sensitive results and operates e ciently, it has been widely adopted to detect animal and human patho-gens, such as hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) virus,human ciency virus (HIV), bovine coronavirus, or MERS-CoV -52]. Currently, RPA has been applied to detect 2019-nCoV, in combination with other technologies,such as CRISPR or micro fluidic technology. 2.1.4. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short PalindromicRepeat- (CRISPR-) Based Detection. The CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system (CRISPR/Cas9) is a revolutionarygene-editing toolbox that can modify target genes with highprecision and that can control various types of genetic dis-eases in preclinical studies [53-56]. Due to the collateralnucleic acid cleavage activity of Cas e ectors, CRISPR/Cas systems have also been widely used in nucleic acid detectionwithfluorescent and colorimetric signals [56]. There are mainly two kinds of CRISPR/Cas systems for diagnostics,based on the cutting activity of Cas protein on nucleic acidsoutside of the gRNA target site: enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK)) was developed by Zhang 's group, based on the collateral e ect of an RNA- guided and RNA-targeting CRISPR e ector, Cas13a (Figure 4(a)) 58]. The detection system is highly sensitive and speci c because it is capable of single-molecule nucleic acid detection. Subsequently, they developed an enhancedSHERLOCK version 2 (SHERLOCKv2) detection systemwith a 3.5-fold improvement in detection sensitivity and lat-eralflow readout. SHERLOCKv2 has been used to detect dengue and Zika virus single-stranded RNA or mutationsin clinical samples, showing great potential for multiplexable,portable, rapid detection of nucleic acids [59]. Recently, they combined RT-RPA technology with the SHERLOCK system (namely CRISPR diagnostics) to detect the S and ORF 1ab genes of 2019-nCoV (Figure 4(b) and (c)) band Contro l band Readout Fluorescence measurement Test band Control bandTest band Control band S gene 1ab gene 20 fM 0.2 aM 0 (-)20 fM 0.2 aM 0 (-)(a) (b) (c) Figure 4: CRISPR-Cas system-based detection of 2019-nCoV.

(b, c) Typical images of lateral flow readout for CRISPR-based detection at various concentrations [60].6 Researchdiagnostics-based test can be conducted in 1 hour and can be read using a dipstick. The analysis is performed at 37\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C, and its detection sensitivity is ten copies per microliter of input, exhibiting unique advantages, such as high sensitiv-ity, speci city, speed, and suitability for point-of-care testing. However, this approach needs to be validated using realpatient samples. Unlike the CRISPR/Cas13a system, the CRISPR/Cas12a system is based on the collateral e ect of Cas12a on single- stranded DNA (ssDNA). Chen and colleagues combinedCas12a ssDNase activation with RPA technology to create anew approach, named DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPRtrans reporter (DETECTR), with attomolar [61]. DETECTR was also vali-dated with clinical samples, showing the capacity for rapid,specic detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) [61]. Recently, DETECTR was investigated to identify the nucleicacid of 2019-nCoV. Lucia et al. applied the DETECTR(CRISPR-Cas12a and RT-RPA) to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), ORF 1b, and ORF 1ab genes of 2019-nCoV using synthetic RNA fragments as sam- ples [62]. Remarkably, all steps of the test were completed in 1 h, and results were visible to the unaided eye. The limit ofdetection for ORF 1abwas ten copies/ L. The advantages of this method are its portability and low cost ( ~US$2 per reac- tion). But this proposed approach also needs to be validatedwith clinical samples before commercialization. AnotherDETECTR-based 2019-nCoV detection strategy was devel-oped by Chiu' s lab [63]. They employed LAMP, CRISPR/- Cas12, and lateral flow assay to detect the E and N genes of 2019-nCoV in clinical samples. This protocol supplied rapid(~30 min), low-cost, and accurate (100% speci c vs. 90% cic for qRT-PCR) 2019-nCoV in respiratory swab samples. Realistically, CRISPR/Cas-based 2019-nCoVdetection technology is highly speci c, rapid, and low cost, but the detection strategy also needs to be validated usingclinical samples. 2.1.5. Micro fluidic-Based Detection. The abovementioned methods are based on relative quanti cation, because they require external calibration with genetic standards or inner reference DNA templates, resulting in unavoidable errorsand other uncertainties. On the contrary, methods that donot need standard curves can provide a quantitative analysis of nucleic acids using absolute quanti cation of genetic cop- ies. Recently, digital PCR and digital LAMP have been achieved with microelectromechanical and microfl uidic technologies [64, 65]. Micro fluidic or lab-on-a-chip techniques use microsized channels to process or manipulate fluids. Micro fluidics has been widely utilized in various elds, including drug screen- ing, tissue engineering, disease diagnostics, and nucleic aciddetection [66, 67]. Based on consumption, micro fluidics shows signi cant promises in clinical applications [68]. Regarding nucleic acid analyses, microfluidic devices aliquot diluted nucleic acid samples into hundreds to millions of discrete nanoliter chambers. The iso- lated chambers contain only one or zero target moleculeaccording to a Poisson distribution. Consequently, the abso-lute copy number of target nucleic acid can be calculatedfrom the number of positive and negative reactions, basedon the Poisson distribution formulas [69, 70]. Both digitalPCR and digital LAMP have employed micro fluidics for pathogen analysis, which is suitable for COVID-19 detection.For instance, Ottesen and colleagues used digital PCR toamplify and analyze multiple genes on a micro fluidic chip [71]. This chip consisted of parallel chambers and microme-chanical valves. The micromechanical valves segmented chambers into independent PCR reactors after the sample flowed into chambers through connection channels. The chip was able to detect several kinds of genes with parallelsample panels. Digital PCR can also be conducted with drop-lets generated by the micro fluidic chip. However, the detec- tion of fluorescent signals in droplets requires special instruments, such as flow cytometers, which may limit its application in point-of-care testing. Additionally, the high temperature in PCR ampli cation tends to evaporate the reaction liquid (nanoliter or even femtoliter), leading tounacceptable errors. Using airtight devices or high pressuredelays liquid evaporation but complicates the devices and increases testing costs. Digital LAMP is more compatible with micro fluidics than digital PCR because it is executed at a moderate temperature. This simpli es micro fluidic devices and reduces testing costs. Many micro fluidic devices have been reported for nucleic acid detection using digital LAMP, such as self-digitization chips,self-priming compartmentalization chips, and droplet-generation chips [72 -74]. As an example, Xia et al. designed a mathematical model using the Monte Carlo method accord-ing to the theories of Poisson statistics and chemometrics [70].The mathematical model illustrated in fluential factors of the digital LAMP assay, guiding the design and analysis of digital LAMP devices. Based on the established mathematical model, they fabricated a spiral chip with 1200 chambers (9.6 nL) forpathogen detection (Figure 5(a) -(c)). This spiral chip operated at 65 \u00b0C without visible liquid evaporation and achieved a quantitative analysis of nucleic acids over four orders of mag-nitude in concentration with a detection limit of 87 copies permL. This portable gadget shows signi cant promise in future point-of-care testing. Micro fluidics, combined with enzyme-DNA nanostruc- tures, is also applied to detecting 2019-nCoV. Ho et al. devel-oped a modular detection platform (termed enVision)consisting of an integrated circuit of enzyme-DNA nano- structures for direct and versatile detection of pathogen nucleic acids from infected cells [75]. Built-in enzymatic cas-cades in the enVision micro fluidic system supply a rapid color readout for detecting HPV. The assay is fast ( <2 h), sen- sitive ( limit of detection < 10 attmol ), and readily quanti ed with smartphones. Recently, they adopted the enVisionmicrofluidic system to detect 2019-nCoV [76]. Preliminary results showed that the enVision platform is sensitive, accu-rate, fast (within 0.5-1 h), and inexpensive (less than $1 pertest kit). This novel platform works at room temperatureand does not require a heater or special pumps, and it uses a minimal amount of samples, making it highly portable. However, this platform needs to be further validated with realclinical samples.7 Research2.2. Target Antigen and Antibody. As mentioned above, the primary diagnostic methods are virological detection involv- ing viral nucleic acids. Another approach to detection is withserological assays that measure antigens or antibodies pres-ent in the host. Such testing provides vital information about host exposure to 2019-nCoV and is useful for detection and surveillance purposes. For instance, this method greatly helpsmedical professionals to determine whether some recoveredpatients have a higher risk of reinfection. However, thedisadvantage is that one should be cautioned that in theearly stages of COVID-19 infection, the host 's antibodies are often not within the detectable range of serological testkits. Besides, there was no proven evidence on the dura-tion of IgM or IgG antibodies circulating in the host afterrecovery. It could be merely a short time frame for detec-tion. As such, serological tests should not be solely usedfor COVID-19 diagnosis. 2.2.1. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Early diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection is of utmost importance both for medical teams to manage patients e ectively and for policymakers to curb the viral spread. Presently, ELISAin cell culture extracts has proven to be the working \"gold standard \"for laboratory diagnosis of 2019-nCoV [77]. ELISA is a plate-based assessment method for detectingand quantifying biomolecules, including peptides, proteins,antibodies, and hormones. ELISA techniques depend on spe- cic antibodies to bind target antigens and a detection system to indicate the presence of antigen binding. In an ELISA, an antigen must be immobilized to a solid surface and thencomplexed with an antibody that is linked to an enzyme.Detection is accomplished by assessing the conjugatedenzyme activity after incubation with a substrate to producea measurable product [78]. Recently, coronavirus proteinshave been widely used in ELISA to diagnose SARS-CoV orother viruses within the coronavirus family [79]. In a bold, novel approach, a team of infectious disease experts in Singapore utilized an ELISA against 2019-nCoVto ascertain that suspected subjects were infected withCOVID-19 and discovered the connection between twoCOVID-19 clusters in the local community [80]. Using bloodsamples taken from alleged COVID-19 patients, theresearchers detected antibodies targeting the spike proteinthat prevented the virus from killing cells in laboratory tests.They veri ed that a couple allegedly infected with COVID-19 had the disease because they had exceedingly elevated levelsof virus-speci c antibodies in their blood. Interestingly, PCR tests on the couple yielded negative results. Because the couple had recovered from the 2019-nCoV infection, they had no viral genetic materials in their bodies, but theantibodies persisted. There were also other reports of usingELISA to diagnose 2019-nCoV infection [81, 82]. Each studyconrmed the high reproducibility and speci city of ELISA in diagnosing COVID-19 patients accurately in clinics. 2.2.2. IgG/IgM Lateral Flow Assay (LFA). Research has estab- lished that the presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) indi- cates a primary defense against viral infections. This IgM defense occurs before the production of high-a nity and adaptive immunoglobulin G (IgG) that is critical for pro- longed immunity and immunological memory [83]. From aprevious study on SARS infections, both IgM and IgG 1 mm 10 mmQuartz inlet Spiral array Glass slide Degassing Loading Partitioning Sealing (a) (b) (c)5 mm 5 mm Bonding Push PDMS plug Figure 5: Microfl uidic-based detection of 2019-nCoV.

Given that 2019- nCoV belongs to the same family of coronaviruses includingMERS and SARS, 2019-nCoV should also generate IgMand IgG antibodies in infected humans. Therefore, thedetection of IgM and IgG antibodies may provide epide-miologists with crucial information on viral infection oftest subjects, allowing them to adjust policies to combatthe pandemic more e ectively. Point-of-care lateral flow immunoassays are performed qualitatively to quickly determine the presence of 2019-nCoV by detecting anti-2019-nCoV IgM and anti-2019- nCoV IgG antibodies in human plasma, serum, or whole blood. A typical device is shown in Figure 6(a). Reddish-purple lines in the readout indicate the presence of 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies in the sample. LFA is basedon the lateral chromatographic flow of reagents that bind and interact with the sample. As the sample flows through the test device, starting at the sample pad region, the anti-2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies, if present, bind tightlyto gold the conjugated pad. When conjugated products in thesample continue to move up the strip, anti-2019-nCoV IgMantibodies and anti-2019-nCoV IgG antibodies bind to anti-human IgM (M line) or anti-human IgG (G line), respectively. No visible lines can be seen when the specimendoes not contain anti-2019-nCoV antibodies because nolabeled complexes bind at the test zone. IgG-labeled goldcolorimetric nanoparticles serve as the control when theybind to anti-rabbit IgG antibodies at the control line (C)(Figure 6(b)). LFA has proven useful in detecting 2019-nCo-VIgM/IgG antibodies in clinical studies, demonstrating88.66% test sensitivity and 90.63% speci city in human blood, serum, and plasma samples. Results from six patientsare shown in Figure 6(c). Common 2019-nCoV detection methods are summarized in Table 1. 2.3. Supplementary Detection Methods. Various diagnostic techniques have been used to complement RT-PCR and antibody-antigen serological testing. These include chestcomputed tomography (CT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Each has its place in diagnostic settings and can serve as a complementary diagnostic tool to aidmedical investigators in diagnosing 2019-nCoV accuratelyin suspected COVID-19 patients.

In clinics, medical imaging tools are indispensable and form an essential com- ponent of viral diagnosis, as well as for monitoring viral pro-gression [85]. They have also been used for follow-up inoutpatient settings for coronavirus-related pulmonary disor-ders. Just like both SARS and MERS, pulmonary complica-tions in COVID-19 patients have been observed. Learningfrom the well-documented SARS and MERS studies, CTimaging results in the acute and chronic periods of COVID-19 are invariant, but not always present [86 -89]. Evidence is found in previous studies on SARS and MERS. The glass opacities observed are not always found inCOVID-19 patients. Crucially, preliminary imaging discov-eries indicate that COVID-19 yields nonspeci c results as well [90-92]. Radiologists are presently striving to any char-acteristics speci c to COVID-19, although present medical information remains limited. Given the precarious situation,there is a pressing need for alternative, complementary diag-nostics. CT is one example. COVID-19 patients oftendevelop \"ground glass \"lung opacities [93]. As such, a CT imaging scan can readily identify lung abnormalities in human subjects, thereby enabling early treatment against COVID-19. CT has demonstrated some common imagingcharacteristics in COVID-19 patients. These features includebilateral, multifocal, ground glass opacities, with a peripheraldistribution (Figure 7(a)) [93]. Crucially, more than half of90 patients under study presented multilobar involvementand lesions more prominently in the lower lobes of theirlungs. Given its feasibility and ease of use, CT has becomean essential tool for the 2019-nCoV infection diagnosis.From a radiological perspective, the advantages of using CTimaging could expedite the rate of diagnosis. It also supportsthe current shortage and heavily reliant on technical know- how during RT-PCR testings. Nonetheless, one limitation is that it should be cautiously utilized as a diagnostic approachbecause there are no proven, evidence-based clinical bene ts of using CT. It could also cause false securities if results arenegative. Other limitations include requirements of relativelyhigh-dose CT scans and long-term, continuous usage, whichcan altogether be logistically challenging and deplete addi-tional medical resources. 2.3.2. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Transmis- sion electron microscopy (TEM) has been used for many years and has had a profound impact on our understanding of illnesses, including viral infections. The thousandfoldenhanced resolution provided by TEM enables investigatorsto visualize viral morphology and to classify viruses into fam-ilies [94]. Mechanistically, TEM operates based on interactions between electrons emitted from a source and materials underexamination. In the present context, it is usually 2019-nCoVin a cellular sample [95]. The detector collects a multitude ofsignals from transmitted electrons, before processing them toreveal viral morphology and location within cells [96]. Typi- cal specimen preparation for TEM includes sample xation, embedding, sectioning, staining, and loading onto the TEM copper grids [94, 97, 98]. 2019-nCoV sampling typically usessupernatants from patient airway epithelial cells. Infectedcells are xed and dehydrated before embedding in resin. A negatively stained, lm-coated grid for examination is simi- larly prepared for contrast enhancement. 2019-nCoV virusparticles seen with TEM are shown [97] (Figure 7(b)). TEMenables microbiologists to rapidly diagnose patients with asingle examination of a single tissue sample. 3. Medical Treatment There are three general approaches to develop potential antiviral treatments of the human coronavirus. Firstly, standard assays may be used to evaluate existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Secondly, chemical libraries con-taining existing compounds or databases may be screened. 500 nm(a) (b) Figure 7: Computed tomography and transmission electron Cross-sectional noncontrast enhanced chest CT radiographs of a man 's lungs with COVID-19. The gure shows enlarged lesions and increased density of the lesions at the outer edge of the lungs (yellow arrows) [93]. (b) A TEM image of the 2019-nCoV grown in cellsat the University of Hong Kong [97].11 ResearchThirdly, speci c, new medications based on the genome and biophysical understanding of 2019-nCoV can be designed and optimized. Therefore, this section will dis-cuss some of the potential 2019-nCoV therapeuticsobtained through these general approaches. Besides chem-ical and biologic drugs commonly used in antiviral thera-pies, we further elaborate on how nanomaterials,nutritional interventions, traditional Chinese medicine,and stem cell therapy can be potentially used for treatment or as an adjuvant to reduce the mortality and morbidity rate of 2019-nCoV patients. Finally, to end this section,we highlight vaccines as a key therapeutic option to erad-icate COVID-19 through herd immunity without gettingthe disease. 3.1. Chemical Drugs. There are currently no approved antivi- ral drugs to treat COVID-19, and patients must depend upon their immune systems to combat the infection. A full- fledged treatment plan has yet to emerge, and both academia andpharmaceutical companies are racing to develop new treat-ments and vaccines to address COVID-19. Research intothe cellular and molecular pathogenesis of 2019-nCoV hasprovided essential insights with the hope of developing viabletherapies. While researchers are working on cures or preven-tive measures for COVID-19 [99], a more robust, e cient, and economical way to tackle the disease is to repurpose existing drugs into a viable therapeutic strategy. Drug repurposing, also termed drug repositioning, refers tothe process of discovering new therapeutic applicationsfor existing drugs. It o ers various advantages over tradi- tional de novo drug discovery, i.e., reduced cost and drugdevelopment time, established drug characteristics, and,most importantly, established safe dosages for humanuse [100]. Repurposed drugs often negate the need forphase 1 clinical trials and can be used immediately[100, 101]. At present, repurposed drugs are the onlyoption available at treatment centers for COVID-19patients. As COVID-19 is a viral infection, the most obvi- ous choices for repurposed drugs come from known anti- viral drugs [102]. Antiviral creation strategies focus ontwo approaches: targeting viruses or targeting host cellfactors. In this section, we will review antiviral drugs pre-scribed or proposed against COVID-19 based on the anti-viral drug creation strategies. 3.1.1. Entry Inhibitors. When an infection occurs, the virus gains entry into a host cell by attaching itself to the host cell surface (Figure 8) [103]. This relies on numerous interactionsbetween the virion surface and the speci c proteins on the cell membrane. In general, these surface proteins have otherfunctions but are serendipitously recognized by the virus asentry receptors [103]. Molecules that prevent such recogni-tion, either by competitive binding or by downregulatingthe receptors, are known as viral entry inhibitors (Figure 9(a)). These inhibitors are valuable as therapeutics since blocking infection early in the life cycle reduces cellularand tissue damage associated with viral replication and pro-duction of viral progeny.As mentioned above, coronavirus particles comprise four structural proteins: the S, E, M, and N proteins [104 -107]. The S protein is the most crucial in viral attachment, fusion,and entry [108]. It comprises two subunits. S1 facilitatesattachment to the host cell receptor, while S2 mediates mem-brane fusion of the virion and the host cell. As mentionedabove, viruses have speci c attachment sites. SARS-CoV rec- Biophysical and structural analysis indicates that the 2019-nCoV S pro- tein binds ACE2 with higher a nity than the SARS-CoV S protein [16]. Therefore, it is vital to target ACE2 for thedevelopment of viral entry inhibitors. To the best of our knowledge, not much is known about ACE2-speci c inhibitors that are commercially available or under commercial development [114]. However, ACE2 stim-ulators have been used in the treatment of hypertension, car-diac diseases, and diabetes mellitus to regulate the renin-angiotensin system [115, 116]. There are also ACE inhibitorsknown for treating the diseases mentioned, but these lack inhibitory activity toward ACE2 due to their distinct substrate-binding pockets [116 -119]. In brief, there are con- cerns that both ACE2 stimulators and ACE inhibitors canincrease the expression of ACE2, which in turn may increasesusceptibility to viral host cell entry [120, 121]. Much workneeds to be done on ACE2-targeting drugs, and controversialissues that lie beyond the treatment pathway need to beaddressed soon. A small antiviral molecule, umifenovir, has entry inhibi- tory eects on the in Umifenovir targets e ect [122 Hemagglutinin, a viral cell surface protein, facilitates infec- tion by undergoing a conformational change when the virus binds to host cells [122]. Umifenovir interacts with hemag-glutinin to stabilize it against low pH-induced conforma-tional change via the formation of an extensive network ofnoncovalent interactions that prevent hemagglutinin-mediated membrane fusion [122, 124]. It also interacts withphospholipids by altering membrane fluidity [125], which is vital for the fusion process. This is most likely due to umife-novir 's molecular interactions (bearing both the H donor and acceptor groups) with the interfacial region of the lipidbilayer by competing for the hydrogen bonding of phospho-lipid C=O groups with water molecules [126]. This renders lipid bilayers of host cells less prone to viral fusion [125]. No studies have shown that umifenovir is e ective in inhibit- ing SARS-CoV or 2019-nCoV. Wang et al. reported that 4patients with mild/severe COVID-19 recovered after pre-scription of combined Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (a traditional Chinesemedicine) [127]. On the other hand, Dong et al. found inanin vitro study that arbidol may e ectively inhibit 2019- nCoV infection at a concentration of 10-30 M [128]. Chloroquine, also a small molecule, is a quinine analog used to prevent and treat malaria. Similar to umifenovir, chloroquine exhibits its inhibitory e ect on in fluenza by pH stabilization. Chloroquine is a weak base and becomes pro- tonated intracellularly in a manner described by the12 ResearchHenderson-Hasselbalch law [129]. It can intracellularly [130 -132]. Chloro- alters the of enzymes, causingenzyme glycosylation, ultimately inhibiting viral replicationin host cells [133, 134]. Liu et al. claimed that chloroquinecould inhibit SARS-CoV entry by changing glycosylation inhibition of SARS-CoV was demonstrated in vitro on primate cells and human rectal cells [136, 137]. Hydroxy-chloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine with an additionalhydroxyl group. These two chloroquines share similar struc-tures and mechanisms. Both have shown in vitro antiviral activities toward 2019-nCoV [138 -140]. Hydroxychloro- quine was more e ective than chloroquine in inhibiting 2019-nCoV in vitro on primate cells [141]. Until now, chlo- roquine has shown apparent e ciency and safety against 2019-nCoV in clinical trials conducted in China [139].Currently, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has beenadministered to hospitalized 2019-nCoV patients on an uncontrolled basis in various countries, including China and the USA [42]. However, it must be noted that chloro-quine nonendosomal pathway Cell attachment and entry 5' 3' Translation Transcription Nucleus Rough ERGolgiERGIC Budding and assembly Vesicle Release SM E NAPPLpro 3CLpro Protease inhibitors Replication inhibitors Entry inhibitors RNA replication Uncoating Figure 8: Proposed schematic of 2019-nCoV replication and potential treatment options O OO HO O HO OHO O O OH OOH HOHHOHR H Ivermectin22,23-Dihydroavermectin B1a: R = C2 H5 22,23-Dihydroavermectin O O O OHO Carolacton(a) nonendosomalNSO ONH2 HO NH O O O OH HOO NHHOHNOHN N O HO NH OO NSHN ONHO mesylate (b) (c) Figure 9: Chemical structure of drugs used to treat COVID-19.

Nevertheless, more investigation and clinical tri-als are needed to evaluate further their e cacy and safety in treating 2019-nCoV. 3.1.2. Protease Inhibitors. Proteases are essential enzymes that regulate cell life processes such as cell growth and death, blood clotting, in flammation, fertilization, and infection [103]. Viral entry into host cells requires S protein priming by host proteases, which subsequently enables the fusion ofviral and cellular membranes [113]. Membrane fusionenables the release of the viral genome into the host cyto-plasm, initiating RNA translation into protein. Mostviruses also encode their proteases to protect viral proteinsby modulating host cell responses. While proteases arevital for cell life processes, they have become promisingtargets for antiviral therapeutic agents. Protease inhibitorsprevent viral replication by binding selectively to viral pro-teases or blocking proteolytic cleavage of protein precur- sors necessary for the production of infectious particles [144]. It is noteworthy that protease inhibitors were amajor therapeutic breakthrough of antiviral drug designin the mid-1990s for the treatment of HIV. Most HIVprotease inhibitors have found prominent clinical use(Figure 9(b)). Coronavirus S proteins can be primed by a multitude of proteases [145]. Ho mann et al. demonstrated that the S pro- tein of 2019-nCoV could be primed by serine proteaseTMRPSS2 [113]. Similarly, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can by other TMPRSS family members[145]. TMPRSS family proteases are widely expressed in the respiratory tract [145, 146], which is likely the reason that coronaviruses cause acute respiratory distress syndrome.Upon successful priming, the viral is translated into viral polyproteins by ribosomes inthe host cell cytoplasm. The by viral 3CLpro and PLpro. PLpro also acts as a deubiquitinase that may remove speci c host cell proteins (e.g., interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF- B)), thus weakening the immune system [147, 149, 150]. Both host and viral proteases are essential thera- peutic targets in the case of COVID-19. Camostat mesylate is a small molecule that has shown an excellent therapeutic e ect for chronic pancreatitis treatment by targeting proteases [113, rats brosis showed camostat mesylate inhibits in flammation, cytokine expression, and brosis in pancreas [154]. It has an addi- tional clinical bene t for pancreatic pain by preventing enzyme-evoked activation of pain receptors [155]. As men-tioned above, the TMPRSS family, especially TMRPSS2, ismost the protease targeted by a coronavirus. Camostatmesylate inhibits TMPRSS2 activity on primate cells in vitro ,completely blocking membrane fusion between the host celland the viral MERS-CoV particle [156]. Zhou et al. claimedthat camostat mesylate displays an inhibitory e ect in mice for SARS-CoV infection [152]. Recent research by Ho mann et al. showed a promising in vitro inhibitory e ect of this ser- ine protease inhibitor in SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV onhuman lung cells, showing potential as a viable option forCOVID-19 treatment [113]. Unfortunately, in vitro and in vivo data for camostat mesylate against coronaviruses are limited. More investigation is required to evaluate camostatmesylate as a potential therapeutic against COVID-19. Lopinavir-ritonavir is a coformulated antiretroviral drug with excellent e cacy against HIV-1. The lopinavir has a core molecular structure identical to ritonavir. The 5-thiazolyl end group and 2-isopropylthiazolyl group in rito-navir are replaced by the phenoxyacetyl group and a mod-ied valine, respectively, in which the amino terminus has six-membered urea attached. In for HIV-1 protease [103]. It represents a higher proportion of the coformulation. Lopinavir contains a hydroxyethylene sca old mimicking a standard peptide bond cleavable by HIV-1 protease [157]. This results in the production of noncontagious viral particles. On the otherhand, ritonavir binds to HIV-1 protease, interrupting thematuration and production of viral particles [158]. A clinicalstudy from Hong Kong has shown that the combination oflopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin treatment for 152 patientsagainst SARS-CoV had an overall favourable clinicalresponse [159]. It has been demonstrated that lopinavir-ritonavir targets 3CLpro of 2019-nCoV and further indicatedthat 3CLpro might be the targets of protease inhibitorsfor other coronaviruses [160]. Regrettably, a recent clinical trial using lopinavir-ritonavir in Wuhan, China, reported that 199 hospitalized adult patients infected with 2019-nCoV did not bene t from the treatment [161]. Given such conflicting clinical data, physicians must carefully weigh lopinavir-ritonavir as a COVID-19 treatment. Darunavir is another antiretroviral protease inhibitor drug e ective against Darunavir is designed for multidr ug-resistant HIV-1 protease variants, due to its molecular structure, which introduces more hydrogen bondscompared to conventional antiretroviral medicines. In gen-eral, changes in van der Waals and hydrogen bonding inter-actions between inhibitors and proteases a ect the potency of antiretroviral drugs [162]. enzymatic dimerization [163]. The dimer-ization of HIV protease is essential for the acquisition of itsproteolytic activity for the maturation of viral particles[163]. Lin et al. claimed that darunavir inhibits 2019-nCoV.The group has used molecular modeling to evaluate daruna-vir binding to 3CLpro and PLpro proteases and found tar-geted activity against the latter [164]. Nevertheless, thetherapeutic e ect of darunavir in COVID-19 clinical cases remains untested [164]. This may be in part due to potentialside eects, such as liver damage and severe skin rashes [103, 165]. These contraindications must be carefully evaluated ifdarunavir is to be considered a potential therapeutic agentfor COVID-19.15 Research3.1.3. Replication Inhibitors. Polymerases are enzymes essen- tial for viral replication to produce viral progeny. Viral DNA and RNA polymerases are responsible for duplicating theviral genome and facilitating transcription and replication[103]. Replication inhibitors (Figure 9(c)) interfere with theproduction of viral particles by blocking enzymatic activity,ultimately causing chain termination during viral DNA orRNA replication [166]. There are four types of viral In the section Protease Inhibitors, we mentioned that RdRp is released upon successful priming. RdRp is a neces-sary polymerase that catalyzes the replication of RNA froman RNA template for coronaviruses [167]. Release of RdRpfrom the virus initiates the synthesis of a full negative-strand RNA template to be used by RdRp to replicate moreviral genomic RNA, which eventually turns host cells intovirus factories [147]. Therefore, RdRp is an attractive thera-peutic target to prevent host cells from producing viruses. Ribavirin is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside analog that mimics purines, including inosine and adenosine, and ribavi-rin has been used in the treatment of respiratory syncytialvirus [168]. It has only one ring at the heterocyclic base, com-pared with guanine 's two rings. Notably, ribavirin has a ribose sugar moiety with a hydroxyl group at the 2 -carbon position, enabling preferential activity e ect on viruses by forcing viral genome replication to become catastrophically error-prone.It is likely that as a nucleoside analog, ribavirin is incorpo- rated by RdRp into the newly synthesized viral genome, where it induces mutagenesis [170, 172]. Although ribavirinhas proven e ective against viral infections, its mechanism of action has not been rmly established, and there are sev- eral proposed mechanisms of action that require further val-idation [168, 173]. Ribavirin was initially used in treatingSARS; however, ribavirin treatment lacked an in vitro antivi- ral eect and caused adverse side e ects including anemia, hypoxemia, and decreased hemoglobin levels [174]. How-ever, ribavirin was used as the primary treatment duringthe MERS outbreak [175]. In general, clinical studies of riba-virin treatment for SARS and MERS did not show strong evi- dence of e cacy against these coronaviruses [176 -178]. There have been no studies of ribavirin 'secacy against COVID-19. Therefore, the use of ribavirin remains contro- versial and requires more investigation for a better under-standing of its mechanism of action, e cacy, and toxicity, even though it is a widely available drug. Favipiravir is a synthetic guanine analog frequently used for in fluenza treatment [179]. Structurally, favipiravir is closely related to ribavirin, in which it shares the same car-boxamide moiety [180]. While ribavirin must be phosphoribosy- lated by cellular enzymes to its active form, favipiravir-ribo- furanosyl-5 -triphosphate (RTP) [181, 182]. The viral polymerase disrupting viral genome Favipiravir has not been used against SARSand MERS previously, but interestingly, it has been shownto reduce viral infection of 2019-nCoV [138, 183]. In a clin-ical study involving 80 patients infected with 2019-nCoV,conducted in Shenzhen, China, favipiravir showed betterecacy than lopinavir-ritonavir in terms of disease pro- gression and viral clearance [183]. Another clinical studyinvolving 240 patients with COVID-19 conducted in Hubei Province, China, also demonstrated that those treated with favipiravir had a higher recovery rate com-pared to those treated with umifenovir (preprint) [184].More clinical data are needed to validate favipiravir 'se- cacy and safety in 2019-nCoV treatment. Remdesivir is a trial synthetic adenosine analog that has not yet been clinically approved [185]. It was synthesizedand developed by Gilead Science in 2017 for Ebola virusinfection [186]. Remdesivir needs to be metabolized into itsactive form, GS-441524, to initiate its activity. The activeform of remdesivir inhibits viral RNA polymerase and evadesproofreading by viral exonuclease, causing an interruption in viral RNA production [138, 185, 186]. It has been demon- in great potential as a therapeutic agent for 2019-nCoV. The drug iscurrently being validated in clinical trials [188]. Given thatantiviral drugs have previously demonstrated reasonableinhibition of coronaviruses lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin been rec-ommended in the latest guidelines for diagnosis andtreatment of COVID-19, updated on 17 February 2020 [189]. Recent studies also demonstrated that some antibiotics potentially inhibit 2019-nCoV replication. Anderson et al.(preprint) recently developed the rst bat genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) and CRISPR libraries and identi-ed MTHFDI as the critical host factor for viral infections [190]. MTHFDI is a trifunctional enzyme involved in theone-carbon participating in cel-lular production of purine, dTMP, and methyl groups [191].Anderson et al. demonstrated that purine synthesis activity ofMTHFDI is an essential activity for viral replication, makingMTHFDI a potential target for developing antiviral drugs[190]. They further explained that an MTHFD1 inhibitor,carolacton, restricts replication of in fluenza virus, mumps virus, Zika virus, and, most secondary metabolitederived from .I t is a macrolide ketocarbonic acid. Carolacton has been stud- ied as compound against bio lmsof 193]. has no toxic e ect against eukaryotic cells [194]. It has recently been identi ed as a potent inhibitor of MTHFDI, and its mechanism of action is presumably due to the ability of carolacton to bindwith MTHFDI [194]. More research is needed to validate the mechanism of action, e cacy, and safety of carolacton as a possible treatment for COVID-19. On the other hand, ivermectin is originally a medication used to treat parasite16 Researchinfestation. It comprises and 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b, at of 4 : 1 [195]. They are macrolide antibioticsisolated from the fungus Streptomyces avermitilis .I th a s reportedly stopped HIV-I proliferation by inhibiting interac-tion of the retroviral integrase protein with adapter protein(importin), responsible for the nuclear protein import cycle[196]. Caly et al. reported that ivermectin successfully inhib-ited 2019-nCoV in vitro but the mechanism of action is unclear [197]. Since ivermectin is an approved drug, it showsgreat potential as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19. In vivo work or clinical trials need to be done to con rm its e cacy and safety for treatment against COVID-19. Potential drugsfor COVID-19 are summarized in Table 2. 3.2. Nanodrug Delivery System. Nanomaterials have recently been utilized for the treatment of diseases such as cancer [198-200] and various types of infections [201, 202]. The ease of modi cation of surface properties, large surface area [203], and multivalent interactions with targets [204] imbuesnanomaterials with massive potential as highly e cacious COVID-19 therapeutic options. However, to the best of ourknowledge, no nanoparticle treatment option has beenapplied to COVID-19. Nonetheless, results obtained fromnanoparticle research against other viruses have shown promising potential. For example, Fujimori et al. utilized a CuI nanoparticle to treat H1N1 in fluenza through the gener- (ROS) that inactivate thevirus [205]. Silver nanoparticles also show much promise intreating COVID-19 with their broad antiviral propertiesagainst a multitude of viruses, including HIV, hepatitis Bvirus, herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, andmonkeypox virus [206]. broad antiviral properties of sil-ver nanoparticles and the generality of ROS inactivation sug-gest that nanoparticles can be utilized therapeuticallywithout any modi cations. Nanoparticles could also be used for drug delivery. Recently, Herold and Sander demonstrated the use of pulmonary surfactant-biomimetic nanoparticles to encapsulate a stimulator of interferon gene (STING) agonist, 2,3-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine mono- phosphate, as an adjuvant in a variety of in fluenza vaccines [207]. Using nanoparticles as a delivery agent, immune cells were activated without excessive in flammation in the lung. This could provide a considerable bene t for use in COVID-19 vaccines in the future, but as the eld is still rela- tively new, especially in medicinal applications, safety shouldremain a key consideration in the adoption of nanoparticlesin humans. 3.3. Biologic Drugs. In addition to chemical medicines, another vital form of therapy for COVID-19 may be the use of biologics. Currently, interferon- 2b nebulization of 100,000 to 400,000 IU/kg twice a day for 5 to 7 days is oneof the main treatments for COVID-19 in children, and ithas demonstrated e cacy in reducing the viral load during early stages of infection [208, 209]. Another promising bio-logic drug is convalescent plasma, the plasma of patientswho have recovered from COVID-19 [210, 211]. Antibodiesin the donated plasma could confer temporary, passiveimmunity against COVID-19, allowing patients time todevelop active immunity. Clinical trials are currently ongoing[212, 213], and preliminary results announced from the Chi-nese hospitals have been promising. On the other hand, human monoclonal antibodies or their fragments developed in the lab have shown encouragingresults as well. Tian et al. con rmed the binding of a human monoclonal antibody CR3022 to the receptor-bindingdomain (RBD) of 2019-nCoV with high a nity [214], highlighting the therapeutic potential of CR3022 towardCOVID-19, though further in vitro and in vivo studies are required before it could be used clinically. 3.4. Nutritional Interventions. Another supportive treatment for COVID-19 involves dietary interventions. Various research studies have shown supplementation of multiplevitamins and minerals such as vitamins A, C, and D and zinccan reduce the severity of respiratory infections [215 -221]. However, most of these studies targeted children below theage of 5 who were su ering from malnourishment or preex- isting diseases. Therefore, vitamin and mineral supplementa- tion may o er more signi cant bene ts to COVID-19 patients in developing countries. Moreover, aggressive sup- plementation of calories and protein in nutritionally bene ts in reducing mortality [222]. Using a modi ed Nutrition Risk in Critically Ill (mNUTRIC) score, Kalaiselvan and coworkers demonstratedthat 42.5% of mechanically ventilated patients have highnutritional risks ( mNUTRIC score 5), accompanied by long intensive care unit (ICU) stays and high mortality rates[223]. An estimated 5% of COVID-19 patients require ICU care, and of these critically ill patients, most need mechanicalventilation [224, 225]. Therefore, nutritional interventionusing aggressive calorie a signi cant cally ill patients. Evidence of such bene ts may be provided by the clinical trial (NCT04274322) that is expected to endin July 2020. 3.5. Traditional Chinese Medicine. Traditional Chinese med- icine (TCM) is considered a prospective supplementary treatment of COVID-19, due to its impressive performancein treating SARS in 2003 [226]. First, TCM shows a general- ized antiviral e ect through direct inhibition of viruses and control of in flammation. For example, Weng et al. reported that the Smabucus Formosana Nakai (a traditional medicinal herb) ethanol stem extract displayed strong anti-HCoV- NL63 activity [227]. Moreover, TCM can alleviate damageinduced by in flammatory reactions and immune responses initiated by viral infections. Single and combined Chinesemedicines could mitigate the cytokine storm by clearing theheat and toxicity in the body. For instance, TCM approacheswere adopted to prevent and treat SARS in 2003 and H1N1influenza in 2009 [228]. As of February 17, 2020, over 85.2% of total con rmed cases (over 60,000 cases) had been treated with TCM, showing that TCM yields excellent out-comes. Notably, in a trial of 102 cases with mild symptoms,TCM achieved remarkable therapeutic e ects, demonstrated17 ResearchTable 2: Potential antiviral drugs for COVID-19.

To date, theNational Health Commission (NHC) of the People' s Repub- lic of China has published seven editions of the guidelines fordiagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 [25]. Since the fourthversion, a list of TCM prescriptions (including TCM soupand TCM capsules) has been recommended for patientsbased on the stage of the disease and their symptoms [230]. According to the 7 thedition of the guidelines, there are three kinds of TCM prescriptions recommended for di erent stages of patients: the medical observation period, the clinicaltreatment period, and critical condition (details in Table 3)[25]. Among TCM recipes, the Qing Fei Pai Du Decoctionis strongly recommended for treatment of COVID-19 bythe NHC of the People 's Republic of China, because it gave a cure rate of over 90% of COVID-19 patients in a clinicaltrial involving 701 con rmed cases [231]. Another TCM rec- ipe, Xue Bi Jing Injection is speci cally recommended for treating critically ill COVID-19 patients, because it sup-presses severe sepsis, according to the China Food and Drug Administration. It also promoted signi cant improvement in cases of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [232]. Therefore, TCM could be an alternative prophylacticapproach to COVID-19 and a supplementary treatment incombination with western medicine to cure COVID-19. 3.6. Stem Cell Therapy. Stem cell therapy is a promising treat- ment strategy for degenerative diseases, including Hunting- ton's disease, Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's diseases, and chronic diseases such as cardiac failure and diabetes [233].A clinical study showed that transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) signi cantly lowered the mortality of patients with H7N9-induced acute respiratory distress syn- drome (ARDS), with no harmful ects [234]. and 2019-nCoV share similar genome structures and corre-sponding infection mechanisms, as well as related clinicalsymptoms (lung failure), MSC-based therapy could be a pos-sible alternative for treating COVID-19. Currently, stem cell-based therapy for COVID-19 is being conducted by di erent hospitals in China. Doctors from Baoshan Hospital (Yunnanprovince, China) used human umbilical cord mesenchymalstem cells (hUCMSCs) to treat a 65-year-old critically illwoman with COVID-19. Two days after the 3rd injections of stem cells, the woman recovered, and the throat swab test for COVID-19 turned negative [235]. Another clinical trialinvolving stem cell therapy was conducted in seven con-rmed COVID-19 patients in di erent clinical stages in Bei- jing Youan Hospital (Beijing, China). Two to four days afterintravenous transplantation of CE2 -MSCs, all symptoms such as high fever, weakness, and shortness of breath disap-peared in all seven patients without observed adverse e ects, indicating that MSCs can cure or signi cantly improve func- tional outcomes [236]. There are at least 12 other trials usingstem cells to treat COVID-19 in China, according to theWHO report. 3.7. Other Treatments. Vaccines are another promising treat- ment to prevent or cure speci c viruses. Currently, there is noeective vaccine against 2019-nCoV. Fortunately, two COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing clinical trials. The rst is Moderna 's mRNA-1273, an mRNA vaccine, which started at KPWHRI in Seattle, USA, on March 16, 2020 [237]. It tar- gets the spike protein of 2019-nCoV. The other vaccine, Ad5-nCoV (a recombinant novel coronavirus disease vaccine(adenovirus type 5 vector)), was conducted at Tongji Hospi-tal in Wuhan, China, on March 16, 2020 [238]. The trial wasjointly developed and administered by CanSino Biologics Inc. and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. Ad5- nCoV, a genetically engineered vaccine, expresses the 2019-nCoV S protein using replication-defective adenovirus type5 as an expression vector, thereby inducing a virus-speci c immune response to prevent COVID-19. There are also sev-eral other types of COVID-19 vaccines, including deopti-mized live attenuated vaccines, protein vaccine, DNAvaccine, RNA vaccine, and subunit vaccine, all of which arein the preclinical stage (Table 4) [239]. Notably, there is anew microneedle array (MNA) approach based on deliveringcoronavirus S1 subunit vaccines against COVID-19. Expe-dited by prior experience in developing vaccines against MERS, this approach was developed within 4 weeks and enabled long-term induction of potent virus-speci c anti- body responses. Signi cantly, the MNA work can be extended to other emerging infectious diseases. However,these will require further clinical studies for e cacy and safety, which requires more time. According to the 7 thedition of the diagnostic criteria [25], patients severely or critically ill with COVID-19 shouldreceive comprehensive antiviral treatment, including lopina-vir/ritonavir, arbidol, or Shufeng Jiedu Capsule. Meanwhile,they also need additional treatments, according to theirsymptoms, including respiratory support (oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannulas, or noninvasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or membrane oxy- genation- (ECMO-) based therapy), circulatory support, orcontinuous renal replacement therapy. The main therapeuticapproaches proposed for COVID-19 are summarized inTable 5. 4. Control and Prevention of COVID-19 As the most recent pandemic, COVID-19 induces much fear.It is highly infectious and is transmitted asymptomatically. As such, our best options to slow and prevent transmission are to understand the origin of 2019-nCoV, its transmissionroute, and associated disease pathways and systems. Gener-ally, a pathogen must remain viable outside the host to allowfor environmental spread [240]. Collective e ects of many biotic and abiotic factors determine the period that the path-ogen can survive [240]. As of now, COVID-19 is thought tobe transmitted directly from person-to-person through liq-uid (droplets) and, more importantly, transmitted indirectlyvia contact with contaminated surfaces. 2019-nCoV remainsviable for a fairly long period outside the human body (up to 72 hours) and is more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard [241]. Therefore, aerosoland fomite transmission of 2019-nCoV is possible, as thevirus lingers among particles or bers, in airborne liquid19 ResearchTable 3: TCM recommendations by guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (7thedition) [25].

Although there are currently insu cient data on the inactiva- tion of environmental 2019-nCoV, data from other corona-viruses can be used as a reference. However, it should benoted that biocidal agents may only limit the survival of coro-navirus in critical environments and have no e cacy for infected patients. Given the high transmissibility of COVID-19, its propen- sity for asymptomatic transmission, and its persistent nature,con rmed patients could only be quarantined and treated in adequately equipped facilities. This also applies to anyonewho has come into contact with these patients. As such,contact tracing is still a mainstay for disease control. Con r- mation can be achieved only when speci c diagnostic methods have been employed. Chest CT imaging is usefulas an initial evaluation for COVID-19, as CT con rmation is often possible even before symptoms appear; therefore, itis recommended for suspected COVID-19 cases [242]. Oncethe primary diagnosis reveals abnormal chest CT ndings, a nucleic acid test should be performed to con rm whether a patient is infected. Once a person is con rmed positive, tests such as C-reactive protein (CRP), completeblood count, urinalysis, biochemical indicators enzymes, and renal function), bloodcoagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis, and cyto-kine levels should be performed to monitor the patient 's condition [189]. Chest CT should be performed as afollow-up to treatment as well [242]. The currentlyadopted procedure in identifying potential COVID-19cases in China is summarized in Figure 10. On a community scale and beyond, strict controls over human tra c are essential to limiting disease transmission. By establishing lockdowns, China has been able to bring thecrisis under control. Other nations are now following theChinese' s approach in restricting movement of residents within their borders. As evidenced globally, social distancingis essential to halt the spread of COVID-19. On the otherhand, individuals have the responsibilities to follow theguidelines given by the authorities, to practice good hygiene,and to behave responsibly. COVID-19, like the past epi- demics, does not recognize political boundaries, ethnicity, or gender. The disease has challenged the economic andmedical infrastructure of the entire globe. As evidenced byevents of the past few months, the impact of the outbreakdepends upon how well we are prepared to face such a chal-lenge. Only with time will we be able to fully evaluate themeasures that are being taken against COVID-19 today. 5. Conclusions Previous coronavirus epidemics like SARS and MERS have expedited the process of nding useful diagnostic and thera- pies against 2019-nCoV. It is of paramount importance for all countries to share essential information about 2019-nCoV to mitigate its spread. Because of this strategicapproach, research has been mobilized to rapidly developdiagnostic methods and worldwide implementation to mini-mize the impact of the pandemic. Practical diagnostic testshave aided management and contact tracing of COVID-19cases in hotspot areas. In this regard, molecular virologicaltechniques have assisted the scienti c community in charac- terizing infectious agents for years. These include qRT-PCR, isothermal ampli cation, and CRISPR technology. On the other hand, serological assays for antibodies and antigens present essential tools to obtain valuable information about prior exposure to 2019-nCoV and theRespitory symptoms with/without fever Historical epidemiology No Yes No pneumoniaCT Pneumonia No pneumoniaCT Pneumonia Exclusion No exclusion Nucleic acid detectionNegative DefinitionPositive14 days self-isolationSelf health motoring Figure 10: Procedures for identifying COVID-19 cases.26 Researchprevalence of infection. These include ELISA and LFA technologies. Serological screening also enables novel vac-cines to be assessed and supports the design of functionalvaccine approaches. Other approaches, including chestcomputed tomography (CT) and transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM), can boost existing detection approaches.Notably, there has been a marked increase in the use of bothCT and TEM to detect 2019-nCoV and other coronaviruses.These complimentary tools reveal the progression of sus- pected infection, which cannot be accomplished by conven- tional diagnostic means. Nonetheless, there is a pressingneed for continuous development of rapid, accurate diagnos-tic devices and strategies to characterize unknown respira-tory pathogens. Despite these signs of progress, the present data suggest that current public health policies and improved diagnosticmeasures alone may not be su cient to eradicate COVID- 19 in the short term. E cacious and novel treatments are desperately required. Presently, large numbers of ongoingclinical trials of various drugs may succeed in minimizingmorbidity and mortality. We have highlighted several of them in this review. Some are highly promising, while others may require more time to demonstrate usefulness. Whilesome drug candidates appear promising and have been usedin treating COVID-19 patients in desperation, it does notnecessarily mean that they are proven safe and e cacious in the long run. As such, stringent criteria must be estab-lished by health regulatory agencies. However, in the longterm, vaccines and prophylactics may be required to curbthe spread of 2019-nCoV.
