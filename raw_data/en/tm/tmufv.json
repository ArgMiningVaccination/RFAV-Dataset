He was formerly a major recurring character in The Vampire Diaries, serving initially as an [antagonist](/wiki/Category:Antagonists) in the second season and eventually becoming a supporting character and protagonist in the third season and fourth seasons. Elijah was an [Original Vampire](/wiki/Original_Vampire). Elijah was the third child and second son of [Mikael](/wiki/Mikael) and [Esther](/wiki/Esther_Mikaelson). He was the younger brother of [Freya](/wiki/Freya_Mikaelson) and [Finn](/wiki/Finn_Mikaelson), and the older brother of [Kol](/wiki/Kol_Mikaelson), [Rebekah](/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson) and Henrik and the older half-brother of [Klaus](/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson). He is also the uncle of Freya and Mathias' unborn son, Klaus and Hayley's daughter, Hope, and Freya and Keelin's son, [Nik](/wiki/Mikaelson_Family). Throughout his long life, Elijah had several romantic relationships. In the early 11th century, Elijah and Klaus were both in love with a Petrova Doppelg\u00e4nger named Tatia. Elijah accidentally killed Tatia after he became a vampire and was traumatized and horrified by the violence of his actions towards her. Elijah's mother, told him to seal the event behind a \"red door\" and to clean himself up. As long as he was clean, nothing of what happened behind the red door could hurt him. As such, this became Elijah's defense mechanism to cope with the horrors of his vampirism for the next thousand years. In the 15th century, Elijah was romantically involved with another Petrova Doppelg\u00e4nger, a young girl from Bulgaria, named Katerina Petrova. In the 19th century, Elijah was romantically involved with a [witch](/wiki/Witch) named C\u00e9leste Dubois, whose death was later caused by his half-brother Klaus. In the 21st century, Elijah rekindled his relationship with Katerina Petrova aka Katherine Pierce, before ending it to go to New Orleans to help Klaus. In New Orleans, Elijah has developed feelings for Hayley Marshall, after he promised to protect her and the child she was carrying. Elijah respectfully kept his distance while she was married to Jackson Kenner. In the second season of The Originals, he and Klaus continued to work in a combined effort to stop Esther, Finn and a resurrected Mikael, while struggling with reawakened sins from his past. He also took Gia, one of Marcel's vampires as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and eventually began a romantic relationship with until Klaus killed her. In the third season, he made it his mission to prevent a prophecy depicting his family's downfall from coming to pass, even taking on his first sired vampire to do it. However, unknowingly, Elijah completed the prophecy himself, by killing Marcel Gerard. After the latter came back to life as the [Beast](/wiki/Upgraded_Original_Vampire) from the prophecy, he bit Elijah and his younger brother Kol, knowing his bite would kill them both. He then banished the Mikaelsons from New Orleans. However, unknown to Marcel, Elijah's older sister Freya linked him and all their siblings to Klaus's life force, giving Hayley time to find cures for them all. In the fourth season, the Hollow used the magic from Elijah's sireline to resurrect herself. Before his death, Freya was able to transfer his soul into a pendant. Elijah was later on restored to his body. However, every vampire in his sireline remained dead. In the series finale, Elijah chose to die once again alongside Klaus when his brother sacrificed himself to destroy the Hollow once and for all. Elijah is a member of the [Mikaelson Family](/wiki/Mikaelson_Family) and an unnamed Witch Family. Early History[ ] Mystic Falls, The Middle Ages, 10th Century Elijah Mikaelson is the third-born of The loss of his first born had hardened Mikael and he proved to be a very strict father, who was feared by all his children. Elijah had a close relationship with his mother, who once mentioned to him that, when she was pregnant with him, she would have Freya sing to him. This was one of the few times Esther ever spoke of her lost daughter. In addition, Elijah was very close to his siblings, with the exception of Finn, who had never recovered from losing Freya and never taken to his new siblings as a result. Elijah was closest to Niklaus and Rebekah, and his younger brother would often carve figurines and statuettes for his brother and sister. However, while Mikael was hard on all his children, he was hardest on Niklaus, whom he saw as weak. Once, when Elijah took his younger brother hunting and complimented him on the improvement of his aim (despite the fact that Niklaus had missed his target), Mikael arrived and started beating Niklaus to 'strengthen' him, threatening Elijah with violence if he tried to intervene. He carried guilt for the rest of his life for not stopping their father's beatings against his brother. Once, Mikael beat Niklaus to near death in a rage and only stopped when both Elijah and Rebekah tried to stop him. That night, Rebekah tried to kill Mikael as he slept to end his abuse of Niklaus but Elijah stopped her and considered killing his father himself. Ultimately, he didn't. They lived among the One morning after a full moon, Klaus came out of the woods, holding his dead little brother Henrik in his arms. Elijah came running to join his mother as she grieved Henrik's death. To ensure that the rest of her family would survive, Esther used a Shortly after becoming a vampire, one night when Niklaus made his first human kill, it triggered his werewolf side. Klaus went on a rampage in wolf form. When he awoke the following morning he was tended to by Elijah unbeknownst to them Tatia had followed them to see what happened. Seeing all the carnage created by Klaus she ran from them in fear and was pursued by Elijah. She had tripped and fell while trying to flee and cut her hand. The blood made Elijah lose control and attack her. She tried to defend herself but was no match and was killed. Elijah brought her corpse to a shocked Esther hoping that she could save her. Esther used the rest of her blood as part of the spell used to bind Klaus' werewolf side, which resulted in Klaus' werewolf gene being dormant. Mikael also made Elijah help him in tying up Klaus so that his mother could do the spell. Elijah suppressed the memory of how Tatia actually died believing he had compelled not killed her in the woods and that Esther killed her when performing the hybrid curse. Then one night, his mother was killed by \" Southern France Elijah ran from Mikael with his siblings, fleeing to Europe where they fed along the countryside. However, Elijah stressed regulation and rules, taking up the duties of the eldest due to Finn's pessimistic view of their immortal lives. Before they had learned compulsion to help cover their tracks, Elijah made sure that they always disposed of the bodies they fed on and killed whoever knew the truth about them. He also made sure that they stood together and didn't separate, reminding his siblings of their vows. One day, they killed noblemen in a caravan and Rebekah proposed that they steal their fine clothing and take up their identities so they could live in a nearby castle. Elijah reminded her that they were in a foreign land with customs far different than they knew. When they discovered a survivor in the attack, a servant of the castle named Lucien, Elijah urged his siblings to kill him before he could make their presence known, possibly bringing Mikael to them. However, when Niklaus called for a vote, only Elijah and Kol voted kill him, with Kol only doing it to appease his own bloodlust rather than necessity like Elijah. With Niklaus' vote, they let Lucien live on the condition that he'd help them pose as nobles and bring them to the castle. Lucien taught them manners so they wouldn't be caught when presented to Count de Martel. When they met the count, Elijah managed to convince the noble of their legitimacy and they pulled off their ruse, being welcomed into his court. Later that year, Elijah and his siblings had managed to comfortably integrate themselves into noble society. They participated in activities of the count's court, including ax throwing competitions, and their secret remained unnoticed. However, after Lucien was taken to the dungeons for supposedly having an affair with the count's daughter, Aurora, Elijah and Klaus intended to rescue him from his punishment. However, Tristan was the one punishing Lucien, torturing him, and reminded Elijah and Klaus that as the count's son, he had a right to give punishment in whatever way he wished. When they persisted, he revealed that he knew what they were, as a survivor of one of Kol's feedings had told him about what they really were. He threatened to expose them as monsters to the entire land. Not wanting to risk the news spreading to Mikael, Elijah and Klaus stepped down and watched while Tristan scarred Lucien. After Klaus had discovered that his blood healed Lucien before Lucien was killed by a guard, Elijah comforted his brother when they prepared to burn his body. However, Lucien awoke from death, eventually transitioning into a vampire. One night, Finn told his siblings that word had spread among the villagers of their presence. They decided it was time to run from the castle, in fear that Mikael would be coming. While they prepared to depart, Aurora, who had been turned into a vampire and had had a romance with Klaus, begged Elijah to let her come with them. Elijah refused, saying that she wasn't their blood. Aurora, furious, told him that she knew things that even Elijah and the other siblings didn't know about Klaus. When Elijah demanded the truth, he learned compulsion, which forced her to tell him what she knew. Aurora told him that Klaus had killed Esther and put the blame on Mikael, lying to all of his siblings. Elijah was enraged by the truth and compelled Aurora to see Klaus for the monster that he was, which soon after led to her rejecting Klaus when he tried to take her with them. Elijah never told Klaus about his involvement in the end of the affair, as he had suppressed the memory behind the \"red door\" in his mind, as he tried to tell Klaus the truth by stating how when Esther broke Elijah's \"red door,\" the memory came back. Some time later, Elijah turned Tristan into the first sired vampire of his line and then compelled him, Lucien Castle, and Aurora to think that they were Elijah, Klaus, and Rebekah so they can act as a decoy to lure their father away from them. After that, Elijah and his four siblings left France. A while after that the five Mikaelsons settled in Tuscany, Italy. Italy[ Elijah was in Italy along with his siblings ] [Rebekah](/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson)and [Klaus](/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson), where he worried that Klaus and Kol's violent behavior was spreading word of the Original vampires and drawing too much attention. They came across a vampire hunter named Alexander who was part of a group called the Brotherhood of the Five, where he publicly executed vampires in presentations on how to kill the \"demons\". Their sister, however, had fallen in love with Alexander so Elijah and Klaus took advantage of the affair as an opportunity to get closer to the hunter and find out his secrets. One day, the siblings were invited to a party at Alexander's home where they were ambushed and neutralized for the first time by White Oak Ash Daggers. Klaus was unaffected by the dagger thanks to his werewolf lineage and undaggered Elijah and the rest of his siblings except [Finn](/wiki/Finn_Mikaelson). 1200s[ ] Elijah founded the ancient vampire society, The Strix together with his lover Aya, after he turned her. They founded The Strix in hopes of bringing like-minded individuals together to create a new, better world. However, not long after, his father found him, started destroying the society he had built, and Elijah was forced to flee with siblings. Elijah had to abandon The Strix to save his family from Mikael but asked Aya to come with him. She refused, staying behind while Elijah fled and Mikael slaughtered The Strix members. By the time Elijah returned, it was too late; Tristan de Martel -together with Aya- took control over the organization. Aya never forgave Elijah for abandoning the group and The Strix were slowly corrupted by Tristan into a more savage, ego-maniacal force than Elijah had ever intended it to be. 1359[ ] According to Elijah's Journal, he had begun noticing [Rebekah](/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson) and [Klaus](/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson) losing their humanity. However, Elijah hoped as their older brother he could lead them down the right path to reclaiming their humanity and carry on the family legacy. But he believed if he fails, their family legacy would fall in ruins. England, 1492[ ] In England, Elijah and Klaus were noblemen in the late 15th century. In the year 1492 Elijah met Katerina Petrova, who was the Doppelg\u00e4nger of Tatia and moments later, showed her to his younger brother Niklaus. Katerina was the key to breaking Klaus' Hybrid Curse through sacrifice. While Elijah was helping Klaus achieve his goal, he started to fall in love with Katerina. And one day Elijah saw Katerina bored, he took her outside to have fun and then they sat at a bench and talked about love. Elijah confessed to her that he didn't believe in love, but Katerina didn't believe him, saying that without love, they wouldn't have a reason to live at all. Klaus then came and interrupted, taking Katerina with him and away from Elijah. Elijah then tried to persuade Klaus to spare her life, but Klaus told him not to bother and that the ritual would go on as planned. On the night of the full moon, Katerina took the [moonstone](/wiki/Moonstone) and fled with the help of Trevor. Klaus assumed Elijah helped her because of their discussion the night before about sparing her life. Elijah promised him that he would find her and Klaus responded with a promise of his own; if he did not find Katerina, he would be killed. Elijah attempted to track down Katerina, but failed. Copenhagen, Denmark, 1500s[ Elijah lived in Copenhagen, Denmark, along with [Klaus](/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson)and [Rebekah](/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson). C\u00e1diz, Spain, 1700s[ ] In 1702, [Kol's](/wiki/Kol_Mikaelson) violence in C\u00e1diz, Spain drew too much attention and brought [Mikael](/wiki/Mikael), straight to the family, burning the country in his wake. While the flames drew closer, Elijah and Klaus searched for Kol while Rebekah brought the daggered Finn onboard a ship to flee from Europe. They found him in a tavern where he drank and feasted on humans carelessly. Despite their warnings of Mikael's arrival, he refused to flee. When Klaus and Elijah insisted, Kol attempted to resist them but was subdued by Elijah as Klaus pulled out one of the white oak ash daggers and successfully daggered and neutralized Kol. 1713[ In 1713, having fled Europe from Mikael, Elijah, along with ] [Klaus](/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson)and [Rebekah](/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson), and their two daggered brothers, sailed across the world, through the Template:W and arrived in the French colony of Louisiana, off the shores of a town they have named New Orleans, 300 years from the present. Upon arriving off the coast of New Orleans, they slaughtered all the men who boarded their ship, but left one alive to question and carry their luggage, including the two coffins of their neutralized brothers, Kol and Finn. 1820In 1820, Elijah, Klaus told her no and told her that if she turned every boy she fell in love with, the humans would cease to exist. The boy then argued with Klaus and he threw him down the stairs while Elijah tried to stop it. While the siblings were going to attend the Governor's son funeral, Klaus saw a boy being whipped and threw an apple at the man and made him stop whipping the boy. Klaus then came to the boy, named him Marcellus and brought him to the family, Elijah saw this and told his sister: \"Perhaps there is hope for our brother after all\". Later in 1820 Elijah is seen visiting the Elijah then gives him a meaningful look and Klaus remembers that Celeste is the witch Elijah has been knocking around with. Elijah takes a revolver and shoots Klaus, who groans in pain. Klaus sees that Elijah cares about Celeste and warns him that they're rounding up the town's witches as they speak. Elijah then began to look for Celeste and found her lying in the bathtub, dead. Elijah touches her, lays his forehead on hers. He screams and blames himself for her death. 1821 In the year 1821, Elijah had grown close to Klaus' ward, Marcellus, encouraging and teaching him. The growing bond between Marcellus and Elijah made Klaus extremely jealous since he had been hoping to be Marcellus' mentor. Angrily declaring that he needed someone to spend time with, Klaus revealed to Elijah that he had undaggered their younger brother, Later, Elijah found Kol tormenting Marcellus, feeding him vampire blood and threatening to turn him, believing in his own twisted mind that it was what Elijah and Klaus wanted. Elijah defended Marcellus from Kol's sadism, grabbing his brother by the neck, only being stopped by Klaus who proceeded to dagger Kol again, recognizing that he was too wild. Elijah later confessed to Kol's daggered body that though he didn't like the daggerings, it was for the best since Kol was a bad influence on Klaus. He also admitted that he'd have to isolate himself from Marcellus to allow Klaus to grow closer to the boy since it would make him a better person. Elijah solemnly sacrificed a close and friendly relationship with Marcellus for Klaus' benefit, treating Marcellus with indifference from that point on. 1887 In the year 1887, 52 years after being daggered by Klaus, Rebekah had finally been undaggered by him. Elijah had helped her reintegrate herself into New Orleans' society and they went to the opera house together. It was a moment that only Elijah and Rebekah shared together. 1914 In the year 1914, Elijah attended his family's Christmas party with his siblings. During the party, Klaus gave a toast to the party-goers, revealing that he knew of betrayal planned by their brother Kol, who had been conspiring with witches against him. Elijah, seemingly having also been informed of his younger brother's treachery, stopped Kol as he tried to flee, holding him down while Klaus daggered him. 1919 In the year 1919, Elijah is seen in a meeting room, meeting with members from the Guerrera Family, a family of thieves and butchers according to Klaus, who says that is noting compared to Later, when Marcel returns home from World War I, he's greeted by both Elijah and Klaus. Klaus tells Marcel, \"The prodigal son has finally learned to hold his liquor.\" Marcel tells him being in the army does that to you. Elijah tells him it's good to have him back, and tells him that Niklaus was beside himself in Marcel's absence. Klaus then tells him that he and Elijah have had a little argument that Marcel might help with a rouge witch who wants a piece of the city they built. Klaus considered to kill him but Elijah meant that negotiation is their best recourse, as Elijah knows how fast news can travel, but also the very horrors of war itself. Klaus reveals that he invited the witch and Elijah told Marcel he could choose what they should do after he saw the witch. Elijah tried to negotiate with him but after all his sacrifices Elijah decided to meet with him in a private room. However Klaus appeared instead as Elijah only comes when they deal and Klaus comes when the deal is closed. Later that year, Elijah is seen by both Rebekah and Genevieve, Rebekah asks if she is interested in Elijah but she confirms she is interested in Klaus, Rebekah then begins to talk of her older brother Six months later in 1919 Elijah and Klaus are seen with a The next day Elijah enters Klaus' room and sees Lana and jokes of him sleeping with an enemy who is now their ally, Klaus tells Elijah they got tickets to The Opera House and asked him to tell Rebekah to bring Marcel with her. Elijah then left them. When Elijah was getting ready for The Opera, his father After Elijah woke up again he rushed to The Opera House and saw Mikael at the stage, as he was feeding from Marcel, Elijah urged his siblings to flee the scene. Mikael then burned down The Opera House and continued to hunt his children. Elijah, Klaus and Rebekah were only a few blocks away. Elijah told Klaus and Rebekah to flee while he delayed his father for a brief time. Klaus and Rebekah then left New Orleans, leaving their older brother behind. Rostock Germany, 1933 Elijah arrived in Rostock Germany, and reunited with Klaus after not seeing him for thirteen years. Elijah came with warning to Klaus that word of his presence in Germany and spread and rumors of Mikael were spreading across Europe. Elijah explained that numerous massacres of werewolf packs had been happening nearby, but Klaus thought the purging was too systematic for Mikael. Elijah worried that Rebekah might be involved by Klaus assured him that she was still in Chicago, with a young vampire, They came across one of the werewolf massacres and Elijah told Klaus that Klaus didn't have to be the savior of the wolves, and reassured him that he accepted and loved that side of him, despite their mother's infidelity. The two argued about Elijah's inaction until Klaus brought up that he was considering daggering Elijah and stacking him on top of Rebekah, revealing that she was already daggered, and the letters Elijah had been receiving from her were really from Klaus. Elijah was disheartened that his brother hadn't changed, and Klaus told him to go back to where he came from, and that if he ever heard rumors of Mikael approach again, to just let him come. A short time later, Elijah met August's \"daughter\", Antoinette Sienna, and the two shared their mutual frustrations with their families. He told her that he compelled workers at the railway to help anyone who wants to leave Germany and she took his offer, giving her a chance to escape from her hateful father. Klaus eventually killed August, sparing the rest of his family, Greta, Antoinette, and Roman Sienna. Throughout The Vampire Diaries Series[ ] Elijah was first introduced when two vampires named Rose and Trevor called a person on Elijah's inner circle in the hope that he would come to meet them and pardon them because they were tired of constantly running from As they were leaving the house that Rose and Trevor were hiding out in, the Salvatore brothers came to rescue Elena. They shot Elijah in the hand with a wooden stake, Elena then came out and threw a The next day Elijah, with the help of the allied Jonas Martin, found Elena through a locator spell and appeared at the window Elena was watching. She saw Elijah and freaked out a little bit. Elijah told Dr. Martin that he knew exactly where to find her. When Elijah found himself in Slater's apartment, he killed the three vampires who were going to take her to In By the Light of the Moon, Elijah meets with Jenna Sommers, who is Elena's aunt, and was then invited to her house. Elena sees Elijah and is extremely shocked. Elijah greeted her, thanked Jenna for inviting him in, and said to Elena that he hoped to see her again soon. Elena runs up to warn her brother, but Elijah raced to the door and told her that they needed to talk. After Elena makes an excuse to In Crying Wolf, Elijah takes on the surname of Smith and when Damon tries to get the truth out of Elijah at the Historical society meeting, Elijah overpowers him and tells him that he can kill him when he's completed his part of the deal. Later, when Damon and Elijah then releases Damon as Alaric comes back to life with the help of his ring, reminding the younger vampire that it was the third time that he saved his life. Under In The Dinner Party, Elijah goes with Jenna into the woods and talks. Then Alaric comes and joins them and he spend hours with Elijah and Jenna. Elijah and Jenna later go to the Grill and meet Damon, Andie and Alaric. Andie asks Elijah and Jenna if they would join the dinner party at the Salvatore boarding house. Elijah says it will be his pleasure. When Elijah comes to the Boarding House for the dinner party with Damon, Alaric, Jenna, Andie Star and John Gilbert, Elijah says if Damon tries to cross him Elijah will kill him and everyone else in the house. During the dinner party, Elijah and Damon take drinks together in the study. As Damon is about to use the dagger to kill Elijah, Alaric enters the room and says they forgot dessert. Unsure of Alaric's interruption, Alaric quickly writes to Damon that the dagger will kill him if he uses it. When Elijah returns to the dinner party, Damon says he doesn't have to protect John as per the deal between Elijah and Elena. Elijah begins to say that he will take Elena away from both Damon and John if Damon becomes a liability. Alaric then stabs Elijah with the white oak ash dagger, seemingly killing him. It is later revealed however that the dagger has to remain in an Original to keep him dead. Elijah shows up at the lake house and tells Elena that their deal is off, and demands that Elena come with him. Elena threatens to turn herself into a vampire, but Elijah calls her bluff. Elena responds by stabbing herself. Elijah, not wanting history to repeat itself, agrees to the terms of the new deal Elena strikes and begs her to let him heal her. As Elena moves towards him through the door, she stabs him with the white oak ash dagger. The day after he was neutralized, Damon is shown trying to torch Elijah's body (dagger still intact) with a flame thrower. However, this doesn't work and Katherine states that Elijah is indestructible. After Klaus almost killed Bonnie, a fearful Elena pulls out the dagger from his chest and waits until Elijah wakes up. Once he does, he thinks Elena is Katherine, calling her \"Katerina\". When coming to his senses, he recognizes that he has not been invited into the \"Elena's\" house, and starts to suffocate and become disoriented until he finally gets out the house. While outside the house catching his breath, he sees While he and Elena talk about Klaus and how she needs his help to defeat Klaus, they drive to The Lockwood Mansion where Elijah needs to get a new suit. Elijah informs Elena that the curse of the sun and moon is fake, Klaus is an original vampire/werewolf hybrid and Elijah's brother, and that he had found a way to save the life of the Doppelg\u00e4nger after the sacrifice. He also reveals he had once cared for Katerina, but that it was a mistake he does not care to iterate. When Elijah and Elena come to The Salvatore Boarding House, they see the Salvatore brothers fighting, which causes Elijah to remember something similar (Niklaus attacking Elijah and blaming him for Katerina escaping). The day after he was resurrected, Elijah explains that the curse should be broken during a full moon and Klaus is preparing for it. Elijah procures an Elijah asks her why and she says that she is the Doppelg\u00e4nger, she is the key to breaking the curse, and if she doesn't do it, Klaus will never stop. Then she goes upstairs to explain it to Damon but Damon, convinced the elixir wouldn't work, forces her to drink his blood. When Damon comes back downstairs, Elijah says she doesn't need the elixir anymore, as feeding her vampire blood rendered it useless. Before he goes he says to Damon that Elena will never forgive him. After The Hybrid Curse is broken and Klaus is delivered to the brink of death, Elijah walks up to his brother. When he is about to rip his brother's heart out, Klaus reveals that he didn't bury their Two days after the ritual, Elijah is in the woods waiting for Klaus to wake after his transformation. When Klaus wakes, Elijah explains that Klaus stayed a werewolf for two days, even when the full moon went. Elijah reminds him of their deal - if he didn't kill Klaus, Klaus promised to reunite Elijah with their family, even though he was almost killed by him. Elijah and Klaus return to Alaric's apartment and find Katherine and Stefan waiting. Klaus explains before he can help Stefan, he has to stick by his deal to Elijah. Elijah explains to Stefan that his brother gave his word that he would reunite him with his family. Then Klaus suddenly appears behind him stabbing Elijah with the white oak ash dagger, neutralizing him. Elijah is later seen in a coffin about to be \"reunited\" with his family. In Ordinary People, when In Our Town, Elijah is mentioned by In The Ties That Bind, Elijah makes his first \"live\" appearance in the third season after being undaggered by Damon, before Klaus could reach the coffins. When Klaus moved his coffins to his house and had to go, Elijah appeared and killed his In Bringing Out The Dead, Elijah asks Klaus if he was surprised to see him since he wasn't the one to remove the dagger. He then fights with Niklaus and Klaus fights back until Elijah falls on dares him to use it, knowing that Klaus will then have Kol to deal with. Klaus then tells Elijah that he killed their father Klaus says because of Stefan Salvatore and asks Elijah's help to destroy Stefan and help him get the fourth coffin in order to reunite their family. Elijah idly stands by as Klaus inserts the dagger back into Kol's heart. Elijah then meets with Damon and says to him that he left a note for him. Elijah then invites Damon to a dinner party at 'The Originals Mansion'. At the dinner party they begin to talk about Tatia, the original Petrova Doppelg\u00e4nger. They reveal that Elijah and Niklaus both loved her equally and that it was her blood which was used to create The Original Vampires. Klaus then tries to make a deal with Stefan, which he rejects. Then Klaus threatens to kill Stefan if Damon doesn't return the missing coffin and asks Elijah to go with Damon. After sometime, it is revealed that Elijah had undaggered his siblings when they all start to enter one by one. Elijah then asks the Salvatores to leave as it's their family business. Then Elijah and the other siblings decide on abandoning Klaus. And while Klaus continues to argue with them, their mother In Dangerous Liaisons, Elijah prevents Rebekah from killing Elena as revenge for daggering her. He then tells her that Esther wants her family to live in peace with the other inhabitants of Mystic Falls and that she doesn't want war. Elijah is then in the morning seen preparing for the ball that night. During the ball, Elijah serves as the master of ceremony and leads the evening into a dance. He later joins Elena as she is going to talk to Esther where he reveals his suspicions to her. He doesn't believe that his mother's forgiveness is sincere and wants to know what she will tell Elena. Elena promises to tell him what Esther says. Later, after Elena talked with his mother, she lied to Elijah by telling him his mother only wanted to apologize for trying to have her killed. Elijah and Elena then raised their glasses of wine when his mother talked to everyone from the stairs, and when she was finished speaking, everyone began to drink the wine with Elena's blood in it. He later witnesses Damon snapping Kol's neck after the latter tried to kill Matt and promises his mother that he will keep Kol and Rebekah from ruining everything with the inhabitants of Mystic Falls. Unbeknownst to Elijah, his mother is planning on killing him and his siblings which is possible since she linked them all as one through the champagne laced with Elena's blood that they drank earlier that evening. Esther regrets having to kill her children, most notably Elijah, commenting on how moral he is to his brother Elijah appears and stops Klaus from killing Damon and then demands the location of their mother or Elena dies. Damon says that they should be at the old witch house, where the Original proceed to confront their mother and brother (Finn). The family has a standoff, but after Damon kills Abby, the witch spirits leave Esther, causing her and Finn to disappear. Elijah later tells Rebekah that they no longer have a mother, only Esther and that Esther only turned them into vampires, whereas they turned themselves into monsters. In the same scene with Rebekah, he also admits that he is a hypocrite as he has not always acted morally, using whatever means necessary to get what he wants. Rebekah tries to defend his actions, saying that they are better than the ones trying to kill them. Elijah questions that and leaves the room. He writes a note to Elena explaining that she has good traits which he admires and that he is filled with regret for what he has done to her. After that Elijah leaves town. In The Departed, Elijah shows up at Elena's house and surprises her with his return. Elena called Stefan and Matt and said that Elijah was with her. When they came and saw Elijah standing there with Elena, they acknowledged each other. Elijah said that he will take Alaric's stake and run from him until Elena dies from old age, like Klaus and Rebekah ran from their father for 1000 years. Elijah then begins to make a deal for Klaus' body with Elena, saying that he will not revive Klaus in her lifetime nor her children's, saying that it may teach him some manners. But Matt didn't believe him, asking why they should trust him since everything Elijah had done has screwed her over in past. This prompts Elijah to apologize for his past actions.He then said that Elena could have been dead when Stefan and Matt came over and that it only mattered whether they wanted to trust him or not. When Elena asked why Elijah wants Klaus back, he said Klaus is his brother and that they remain together. Elena then made a deal with Elijah to hand his brother back to him. After Alaric staked Klaus with the white oak stake, Stefan told Elijah about it and then Elijah waited for Rebekah to come to him. When Rebekah came, she said that Klaus was gone and that there was nothing she could do to stop it. They both hugged each other and mourned Klaus' death. Elijah said that In Growing Pains, the Town Council had hoped that capturing In The Five, In Catch Me If You Can, when the feud between In American Gothic, when Elijah, he threatens Stefan that if anything happens to Katherine he will descend upon Elena. He realizes she had turned off her humanity and sees her as a vampire for the first time. She told him that Katherine had killed her brother Katherine arrived and tried to explain herself but Elijah's distrust of her made it hard for him to go along with her plans but she finally gave him the cure, proving herself to him and telling him that she truly did love him. With the cure now in his possession, Elijah spoke with Rebekah, uncertain as to why she would want to be human since that would take her away from her family. He then spoke to Klaus over the phone, telling his brother that he now has the cure and intends to bring it back to Mystic Falls, much to Klaus' elation. When Klaus voices out that Elijah may have a long list of demands before handing it over, Elijah tells him \"Not that long.\" In Pictures of You, Elijah, Rebekah and Klaus have a conversation about who deserves the cure more than the other. Rebekah explains her wish to becoming human, but Klaus teases his sister's wishes and Elijah said to his brother to come with a more compelling reason why he should have the cure. Klaus told him that Later, Elijah gets the Elijah waited for Rebekah at her house and he handed the cure and asked if she truly wanted it, she took it and thanked her brother. The real Rebekah then called, Elijah confused answered the phone, and Rebekah told him that something was not right and told him not to take his hands off the cure, but Elijah told her it was too late for that. In The Originals, Elijah tells Rebekah that their brother Niklaus has gone to New Orleans to find out who is plotting against him. Elijah then decided to head to New Orleans to find out who is plotting against his brother and tells Rebekah, that he will either stop them or help them. \"Depending, on my mood.\" Once Elijah came to New Orleans he saved a Elijah then meets with his brother and tells him to come with him and tells him he has found out who is plotting against him. Elijah leads Klaus to an old cemetery where they meet with Sophie. Sophie demands him to help her and the other witches get rid of Marcel. Sophie and Elijah then reveal that the Elijah tried to convince his brother, that it was a gift and that it was their chance to be a family after all the centuries of being despised by their own parents and their lives being ruined. He tells his brother this was their chance to take back everything they've lost. Klaus refused to save Hayley and his child and then left Elijah. Elijah called Rebekah, and told her that neither of them is good without that child, Rebekah then asked when he would stop searching for Klaus' redemption. Elijah responded with. \"I'll stop searching for his redemption, when I believe there's none left to be found\". Elijah then later sat with Klaus at a bench and talked of how much fun they had in New Orleans and of how they had to leave thanks to their Elijah then met with Sophie in the morning and asked her how this would work, Sophie told him that Klaus needs to come in Marcel's inner circle, and they'll be hitting Marcel where it hurts. Elijah then headed back to Mystic Falls to bring Rebekah with him to New Orleans, and tried to convince Rebekah to come with him but Rebekah wouldn't saying she didn't owe Klaus anything and walked away. Katherine then appeared before Elijah and told him his sister is right about Klaus. Elijah kissed Katherine on the forehead and told her goodbye. In 500 Years of Solitude, when Katherine is dying in bed, [Damon](/wiki/Damon_Salvatore) messes with her mind and creates hallucinations of Jenna Sommers, John Gilbert and then makes a hallucination of Elijah. She sees Elijah and thinks it is real, she says his name and he comes to her bed and she is glad to see him. He says \"Katerina\". She lays her hand on him, and says \"You're here\". Then she realized it was just Damon playing with her mind and told her no one is coming for her as no one cares. Elijah is in fact still living in New Orleans. It is possible that Elijah did not know Katherine was dying because Klaus probably didn't tell him as [Klaus](/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson) wanted to return to Mystic Falls to gloat over Katherine's corpse and see [Caroline](/wiki/Caroline_Forbes) otherwise Elijah would have stopped him. In Moonlight on the Bayou, Elijah is mentioned by [Stefan](/wiki/Stefan_Salvatore) in his conversation with Klaus at the St. James Infirmary bar, when Stefan asks the younger Mikaelson what has happened to him since they last saw each other. Throughout The Originals Series[ ] In Always and Forever, Elijah is seen talking with the bartender, Camille, about his Elijah reminds her she's taken take backs many times during the centuries and even when their Sophie explains to Elijah that a Elijah then finds his brother arguing with Marcel and it ends with Klaus biting one of Marcel's vampires. Elijah then calls Rebekah again to update her on the recent events, also telling her that their brother is willingly to give up everything, he's lashing out in blind rage and the last time Elijah saw something like that, it lasted for 200 years. Elijah further explains that Klaus was so close to feel happiness when he heard the baby's heartbeat for the first time, but now his temper has destroyed it. He then tells his sister he's almost out of time to get the girl to which Rebekah responds to get the girl before it's too late and Elijah swears to her he'll not let anything happen to the girl or her child. He then meets up with Marcel and tells him it's time for them to have a little chat. Elijah asks him of how he has control of the magic in the French Quarter, Marcel tells him it's his business. Elijah then makes a deal with Marcel, if the body of Jane-Anne is released to the witches, Klaus will cure the vampire he bit. Elijah then brought the body of Jane-Anne to the witches so that they could bring her to rest. Elijah tells them Klaus will agree to their terms, he only needs more time. Elijah then finds Klaus and this time, holds Klaus by the throat and tells him that he won't not walk away from this and threatens Klaus that he'll never let go of his brother, even if he has to beat some humanity into him like their father used to do. After their short fight, Klaus tells him he hasn't cared about anything for centuries and asks why Elijah does, who explains to his brother because he failed him once and says he should have killed his own father the second he laid a hand on Klaus and says \"Family above all\". Later, Klaus and Elijah sit on a bench and discuss what his child could offer him. Klaus then tells Elijah to tell Sophie that they have a deal. The next day, Elijah moves Hayley to the Originals old sanctuary and tells her that she's now the most important person in the family, promising her that he'll always protect her. Klaus and Elijah then go to talk in private and discuss if and when Rebekah would join them. Klaus starts to doubt Elijah's value in his mission to reclaim his throne from Marcel so he stabs him with the White Oak Ash Dagger, neutralizing him. He then tells his brother that there's no power in love and that mercy and family make you weak. In House of the Rising Son, three months later without any calls from her big brother Elijah, Rebekah is determined to go back to their old stumping ground. Once she arrives at the Mikaelson Mansion, she learns from Hayley that Elijah is nowhere to be found. When she confronts Klaus, she flashes back to 1820, New Orleans, when her family was happy, even Elijah who was seen kissing a woman named Celeste. Back in the present, Rebekah, with Hayley's help, discovers that Elijah's coffin is not at their house. Rebekah visits the witch Sophie and tells her of how Klaus met Marcel and that without Elijah between Klaus and Marcel, who knows what will happen. Klaus later reveals to Rebekah that he neutralized Elijah and brought him to Marcel for peace keeping. Rebekah then makes Marcel lead her to Elijah after she threatened Camille. Marcel leads Rebekah to a room where she needs to be invited in by a girl named In Tangled Up In Blue, Hayley is seen reading Elijah's journals of his life as a vampire and how he felt about his siblings stepping away from the humanity they once possessed. Marcel promises Klaus he'll hand Elijah back to him after being saved by Klaus' hand from In the opening of Girl in New Orleans, Davina is seen pulling the dagger out of Elijah's chest, but shoving it back in the moment Marcel enters the room, demonstrating that she is still searching for a way to destroy the Original. After a conversation with Diego, Rebekah finds the church Marcel keeps Elijah's coffin hidden, but is unable to enter the room his coffin is kept due to being uninvited. As Rebekah glares into the room, she spies her sleeping brother who, to Rebekah's surprise, opens his eyes and stares at her. Rebekah finds herself in a dream-like state in front of a carriage. Elijah reveals himself behind her and tells her that he sent her into a memory only the two of them share to properly communicate with each other and to make sure Davina was not playing mind games with him. In her memory, the two of them visiting an opera house shortly after Rebekah's undaggering, Elijah tells Rebekah that due to Davina's removal of the dagger, the weapon lost its effect (it needs to be dipped in white oak ash to keep him down) on him and his body is slowly restoring. But instead of taking his sisters offer to help him flee Davina's attic, he proposes to try and talk to the young witch and win her for his side. In the meantime, Elijah wishes Rebekah and Niklaus to look after Hayley and her unborn baby. After making Rebekah swear to keep this promise, he sends her out of the mind induced dream state. Rebekah leaves the attic afterwards.After being confronted with Klaus in the church and having to say goodbye forever to Tim, Davina flees into her room and wants to be by herself. As she stares with sadness at Tim's broken violin, she makes her wind chimes play by her magic, but her sentimental mood comes to a sudden stop as the lid of Elijah's coffin closes. As she slowly walks towards the coffin, she hears a sound behind her and turns around. She spies Elijah slowly returning to normal, standing behind her, telling her not to be afraid and claiming not to wish her any harm. In a calm voice, the Old One lets the girl know that the two of them are in a dire need of a conversation. Both exchange a long look at each other. In Sinners and Saints, Elijah confronts Davina as his body re-awakened from the daggering. He explains that they could stop a war between the witches and vampires before it even started if they would just hear each other out. Davina then gives him a drop of her blood to rejuvenate him. Elijah asked her if she played the violin, but she said it wasn't hers, then Marcel comes and tells Elijah then asks her of her friends. Davina tells him of her friend Tim whose violin he is repairing and of her best friend, Monique Deveraux. Elijah then looks a little surprised about this. Davina continues to tell her story of The Harvest and explains that she was the only survivor of it and that she got all her powers from the 3 dead girls. She also explains that Marcel rescued her from the sacrifice which is why she allied with him. Elijah appeals to her caring side, telling her that he'd help her control the magic that is consuming her life, promising that if she works with him, he would let her see his mother's book of spells. Davina agrees to the terms, but asks him why he's still trying to protect Klaus after what he did to him. Elijah tells her he has given up on giving up and says \"I'll fight for my family. Until my last breath\". Davina then also tells Elijah that she will fight the witches until her last breath. Then Elijah leaves to find Marcel and Klaus in an argument. Elijah knocks Marcel down and reminds him that the only one allowed to harm his brother is him. Klaus and Elijah go back to the Mikaelson Mansion to a warm welcome from Rebekah and a surprisingly warm one from Hayley, who simply tells Elijah to not make promises that he can't keep. Elijah then tells his siblings and Hayley that everything they were told by Sophie and the witches was a lie. The war between the witches and the vampires for control is in fact about family. Sophie wants to resurrect her niece by killing Davina and that makes her their most dangerous enemy. In Fruit of the Poisoned Tree, Elijah is looking through his mothers grimoire and tells his sister the dead girl in front of him is about forgiveness which can not be bought and that's what Klaus was trying at. Elijah then sees Hayley and follows her to the kitchen, where she is making breakfast and tells her good morning. Hayley tells him and Rebekah if it would kill them to buy some milk in the house to which Elijah responds he hopes his siblings were hospitable towards Hayley in his absence. Hayley addresses his absence and all the trouble that has happened since. Elijah then brings a bowl, a spoon and a bag of cereal to the counter and smiles sympathetically as he pulls orange juice and milk out of the fridge, pours Hayley a bowl of cereal and then fills it with milk. She tells him that his siblings have been weirdly protective of her and she has Elijah to thank for that. Elijah tells her he's just glad she is in one piece and talks about the witches and that it is time both Hayley and Sophie are unlinked. Rebekah then comes in and drags the dead girl behind, asking who they have to kill. Elijah responds: \"Probably no one. Alright, potentially everyone\". Elijah then takes charge of the operation to put an end to the war between the witches and vampires. In his attempt, the witch Agnes takes Sophie hostage and uses the link between her and Hayley to put a curse on Hayley. While Elijah and Klaus are going to pay Davina a visit, Elijah tells Rebekah to babysit Hayley. The spell was going to kill the unborn child inside Hayley by raising her body temperature. Elijah went to Davina and gave her the first of the pages she was to receive from his mother's book and promised her if she could complete the spell, she would receive another page of her choosing. Elijah and Klaus later find Sabine and demand to know where Agnes is. She tells them they don't care about the witches, but she wouldn't say anything as she was the last of the elders. Elijah and Klaus then find Sophie and tell her that their deal is off, then brought Sophie to the Mikaelson Mansion. Elijah, with the help of Sophie, tries to keep Hayley's temperature down, until Davina had unlinked Hayley and Sophie. Hayley was no longer under the spell that would've killed her child. Elijah sought vengeance against Agnes, though Klaus was already enacting his own brand of retribution. Sophie made Elijah promise that he wouldn't let Klaus kill Agnes and Elijah reluctantly agreed, promising to keep his word. Once Elijah had changed clothes and on his way out, Rebekah wanted to talk to him about leaving New Orleans with her, but come to realize that Elijah will never leave Klaus or the city, they both then say goodbye to each other. When Elijah arrived at the church where Klaus was mere moments away from killing Agnes, he pleaded with his younger brother that if he really wanted his forgiveness for sticking a dagger in his heart, he'd spare her. Klaus surprisingly released her, irritated that Elijah was ruining the fun. Elijah, however, had made no promise of keeping his own hands off Agnes. He hastily ripped out the hearts of some of the onlookers before snapping Agnes' neck, telling her that he kept his promise that he wouldn't let his brother harm her, he didn't promise that he wouldn't, and told her. \"No one hurts my family and lives. No one\". When he arrived back at the Mikaelson mansion, he discovered Hayley was gone and called Rebekah if Hayley was with her, Klaus then came and told him that Marcel had been here. Elijah then knew she had been abducted by Marcel. In Bloodletting, Klaus and Elijah arrive in The Abattoir's courtyard witnessing the vampire's fighting each other in order to obtain a daylight ring. They quickly make their presence known when Klaus snaps the neck of a vampire named Felicity. Marcel demands to know what they think they are doing barging into his home to which Elijah responds by threatening them unless they tell him where Hayley is. The brothers head outside the courtyard when Marcel approaches them, saying to Elijah he preferred him inside the box although he hands Sabine over to them, granting them one locator spell to find Hayley. When Sabine has a location, revealing she is in The Bayou, Klaus snorts to Elijah that if he's afraid to ruin his expensive shows, Elijah looks to him and changes his mind that he could do with a decent walk after being inside a coffin. They then set off towards the Bayou to search for her. Klaus begins to question Elijah about Hayley, about his admiring him, believing he \"touched a nerve\" when Elijah responds maybe he should wait inside the car. When Klaus stops suddenly, Elijah asks if he has her scent, but Klaus grows that it is the scent of someone he thought he was rid of - After Elijah finds Hayley, he brings her to a shack deep into the Bayou where they meet with Klaus who shoves a dead hybrid away from him, professing her never sired him. He demands to know what happened and Hayley retaliates, walking forwards yelling \"as if you didn't know.\" but Elijah holds her back. Hayley previously told him about her theory and Elijah retells it to Niklaus, clearly believing it himself. He tells Klaus, Tyler brought Hayley here to prove a theory, that the child's blood could be used to sire hybrids, and it was his intention to create a hybrid army. Klaus is clearly hurt but angry at the accusation, especially because Elijah chose to believe her over him. Although he has picked up on Elijah's relationship with Hayley and says \"how quickly you believe the worst, especially when it comes from her\". Elijah is quick to defend them saying that Klaus has never demonstrated any kind of concern towards Hayley or the baby other than his own selfish desires, imitating his words \"Every king needs an heir\". Klaus says that he isn't surprised Elijah doubts his intentions as standing next to the noble Elijah, he will always be \"a liar, a manipulator, a bastard\". telling him everyone including Rebekah and Hayley hangs onto his every word, and no doubt his child will too. Elijah attempts to talk, but Klaus interrupts him saying he will play the role given, confusing Hayley and Elijah for a moment. As he turns, he quickly turns back towards his brother and viciously bites him. When Elijah and Hayley are inside the shack, Elijah tells her maybe he was too quick to condemn Klaus as they have all committed numerous terrible acts over the centuries. In The River in Reverse, in the Bayou Elijah is beginning to feel the affect of the Hayley is then outside the hut by a lake, Elijah is then groaning in pain, Hayley goes in and sits down on the bed and lays a hand on his forehead. Elijah then has a memory of A woman, Celeste, is sitting in a bathtub, Elijah enters the room. he says \"Celeste?\" Hayley looks irritated. Elijah suddenly realizes it was just a memory, and told he thought she were someone else. Hayley says Celeste with a little jealousy. says \"Whoever she was, she was smokin' hot.\". He then knew he let her enter his thoughts and memories, then tells her, she should go. But Hayley tells him it's fine, and that she's taking care him while he's sick. He then sense they're being watched and tells Hayley, She then goes outside. Eve is standing near the hut. When she sees Hayley, she runs away. Elijah then has a another flashback memory of Celeste. He shivers and groans in pain, and explains to Hayley she has to leave and that his mind is flooded with torturous memories. She doesn't get why he won't accept her help. But Elijah explains that, there are consequences for those that care. And tells her, he will not have her pay that price, but Hayley wants to stay. Elijah then asked about the one who watched them. She didn't know but was guessing she left the bible and would be nice if she'd stick around long enough to tell why. He then tells her she came here to gather information about her family and to learn what she can. Elijah has memories of Celeste and Klaus while Hayley is taking care of him. He then says \"Celeste. Forgive me. I'm sorry\". Elijah startles up scared. He screams loudly and Hayley seems worried. Elijah hallucinates and doesn't realize he's harming Hayley. He thinks she's Klaus and wants to kill him. Elijah jumps up and put his hand around Hayley's neck. Hayley starts fighting for air. Suddenly someone stabs Elijah in the back. It's the werewolf Eve. Elijah then appears after being staked. He then tells to Hayley and Eve \"Good evening\". He then tells Eve, he might have something which belongs to her, he shows the stake Eve used to stake him with. Hayley asks if he's okay. he tells her the wound is healed, the fever is broken but for some strange reason he has sharp and lingering sensation in his back. Elijah then asked what had happened and she told him she just met part of her family. They both drove back to the Mikaelson Mansion, Hayley then asked what had happened to Celeste and he showed her. Celeste was laying dead in the bathtub underwater, he then mourned over her and screamed. Elijah told it was difficult time to be a witch and she died because of his brother, but also because of himself as he had abandoned his brother. Hayley didn't get it, and asked why he trying to fix his family when one part of it is broken, but Elijah tells her that the very definition of the word broken can suggest that something can be fixed. Hayley then reaches her hand to Elijah, but tells her no as he doesn't want her to be harmed and then leaves the car to join his siblings in the house. Elijah enters the house as Klaus is about to dagger Rebekah, he stops his brother. Klaus then says maybe Elijah should be daggered with every moment of affection he shows to Hayley and says that if that continues his child will grow up to call him father. Rebekah says that it's Klaus that pushes them away, not the other way around. Klaus then tells Rebekah that every thing he has done is to take back their empire which was taken from them by Marcel and that he has his empire and his new home and will live there while Rebekah and Elijah live in the Mikaelson Mansion and rot. Klaus then gives Elijah the White Oak Ash Dagger and leaves with Hayley. In Reigning Pain in New Orleans, people were already moving things out of the Mikaelson Family Mansion, Rebekah jokes about she paid for them and Elijah responds she never paid for anything in her life. When Rebekah asks where Elijah is going, he tells her to make sure Hayley doesn't suffer for their mistakes. Niklaus is feeling vindictive, they cannot trust that she is safe. Elijah then comes to The Abattoir and knocks Diego out, he tells Hayley to come with him. Hayley tells them they, don't have to worry about her. She's been deemed under protection by the almighty Klaus. It's the werewolves who need help. He ordered a wolf hunt as a peace offering to Marcel's crew. Hayley tells them they have to help them. Elijah agrees to help with Rebekah as his sidekick. In the bayou, Elijah and Rebekah find Diego and the boys stopping them from finding the wolves. Elijah senses Eve and goes to her. Eve warns them that if the wolves don't want to be found they won't. She tells them she has something to tell them. In the bayou, Rebekah and Elijah are still talking to Eve. She's got a map showing them the swamp. She tells them about the new wolves that has came into town. She tells them that they are going to want to keep the wolves alive, Elijah asks why and she tells them to see for themselves. Rebekah and Elijah are still in the bayou, looking for wolves. Rebekah makes Elijah admit that he likes Hayley. They hear screaming and see a bunch of wolves running from Diego and some other Vampires. Diego isn't willing to go easily, but Elijah makes it clear that they need to leave or he will kill them. Back at the Mikaelson Mansion, Klaus is playing around on the piano when Rebekah and Elijah come in. He had been informed about their interfering. They found out that the \"son\" was a werewolf and a vampire, the bloodline of the new werewolves is Klaus' bloodline of his real father. He tells them he's had enough of family and leaves. Klaus leaves Rebekah and Elijah alone in the house. Elijah looks sad, defeated. Elijah then visits Hayley and tells her, that the werewolves are safe and then tells her to keep her wolf mark hidden and leaves. He then appears behind Klaus and apologizes for having accused him of having ulterior motives regarding the child, and tells him he was wrong. He then says. \"I'm sorry.\" Elijah then tells him it isn't always easy to love him, Klaus then tells him, he and Rebekah are welcome to join him as it is their family home. In The Casket Girls, Elijah is first seen with Hayley before Casket Girls Festival as she tries on the dress. Elijah asks her if she needs some help with the dress, Hayley responds with. \"You might need to use all your vampire strength.\" Elijah says \"Allow me.\" Elijah stands behind her and begins to fasten her zipper and buttons. Elijah then tells he thinks she looks lovely, He then touches her birth mark and she covers it with her hand. Elijah tells she should keep it covered even with his family's protection, she shouldn't take any chances. As Hayley is moody about her pregnancy Elijah offers to take her to the festival. Hayley refuses as she doesn't want to make Klaus upset about anymore than he already is and then asks him to help her out of her dress. Hayley motions to her zipper and Elijah steps forwards unbuttoning and unzipping her dress. He hesitates before smiling and leaving. When Klaus discovers that Davina is missing Elijah joins him to find her. When Marcel accuses him for taking Davina, he assures him that he has no desire to harm her in any way. To prove it he tells Marcel that he is worried about how Klaus will operate to get Davina back and they make alliance to work together. Later Marcel and Elijah is seen at the festival, Klaus then joined and later Rebekah trying to find Davina. Klaus assured them they would soon have her. Elijah recognized that tone of voice Klaus had and knew Klaus was planning something. Klaus then kidnaps Davina's friend he stays at his side, playing until Davina arrives. Elijah complains of the music Klaus makes Davina's friend played and Klaus agreed. Marcel then shows up and says When Davina shows up they need to let him do the talking. Davina then arrives and is angry against all of them and attacks them forcing Klaus to turn into his Wolf form and makes Elijah choke out his blood from the victims he has fed on in his 1000 years as an In Apr\u00e8s Moi, Le D\u00e9luge, Elijah explains history of the Sophie about the connection between Davina's drawings about Celeste and the fact that Sophie stole remains from the same person. They are interrupted by earthquake as Davina's power starts to take more serious effects. He and Klaus discuss Davina that she must be sacrificed, Marcel then comes and punches Klaus and tells him, he's not touching her. Elijah tries to calm down Marcel and tells him, he doesn't like to either but tells him that Davina will die either way. Klaus then tells him how New Orleans will soon be consumed by fire and tells him he won't let the town burn down a third time. Elijah asks him if he is a people's person, Elijah then tells Klaus he will go to pay his respect to Celeste as Sophie starts to take her power from her bones. When Rebekah calls him and informs him that Marcel took Davina. Elijah joins his family to help to get her back when locator spell doesn't work well and their attempt to get Celeste's power fails. As they realize that the only way to protect them from greater harm is to complete the harvest Elijah comes up with plan on his own. He plans to make his mother In Dance Back from the Grave, Elijah meets Rebekah and sees that she is conspiring against Klaus and is very disappointed in her and tells he will never be against Klaus or her and asks her if she cannot support him, he then asks do noting to offend him. Elijah is alerted by her theory that someone must have taken the power from the harvest ritual. When the vampires in the quarter start dying he with Klaus investigate who and what could have done a spell like this and recalled Papa Tunde who Klaus killed. Elijah wants to make sure that Hayley is safe and struggles to fight his feelings for her. When Rebekah doesn't answer his calls he begins worrying and is afraid that she might be involved with the deaths in the quarter. He sees Thierry and tells him his sister is fond of him and asks him to explain, Thierry answers him wrong and Elijah threatens him for answers and find out that Rebekah has been attacked by a powerful witch. He takes Hayley with him to where Thierry told them she was and they found Rebekah laying in a circle spell, which they could not enter. He calls Sophie from his phone and asks how they can enter, she gives some ideas and Elijah then figures out that he could use the blood of Klaus' unborn child to break the spell. When Rebekah is free he breaks Thierry's neck and confronts her and blames her for conspiring against her own blood. Rebekah calls him a hypocrite because he blames her for tearing their family apart, but his own feelings for Hayley are making much more damage to their family. Elijah is later seen a the mansion looking up towards Hayley. In Crescent City, Elijah is first seen when he is investigating Papa Tunde's body and tries to figure out what is up with the witches. When they realize that something bigger is about to happen, after hearing of Monique Deveraux resurrection, Hayley tells them that Celeste might be the one to die for Davina to resurrect. Elijah asks Rebekah to take Hayley to the plantation house where she could be safe. Rebekah agrees because she hopes to end their quarrel. Elijah seeks out Sabine (Celeste) hoping that she would help him so they could avoid unnecessary conflict between vampires and the witches. C\u00e9leste tells him that they might make a deal with Elijah, but there will never be any peace as long as Klaus is involved. Elijah asks her to take him on tour so they could talk and soon guesses that Sabine is C\u00e9leste. Elijah tells her how he has put the pieces together which lead him to this notion. They kiss but C\u00e9leste poisons it, because she wants to teach him the error of his ways and break his loyalty to his family. C\u00e9leste weakened him and then makes him choose between his family and Hayley and tells him that he has power to save only one of them. Elijah chooses Hayley and saves her and her friend, Jackson, from the burning house, but as C\u00e9leste promised he is not fast enough to find Rebekah in time. Once Hayley is safe he starts looking for his sister but finds only some bloody wolf bodies. Instead of finding Rebekah he encounters Celeste and the other witches, Celeste takes great pleasure that he saved Hayley and left his family in danger. When he is free again he runs to Marcel and orders that every vampire is going to help him find Rebekah and Klaus, and then he plans to kill the witches. In Long Way Back From Hell, Elijah interrupts Sophie's consecration and is shocked of her recent death. He questions Monique for information on the location of his siblings. Monique responds by casting a spell that places names all over his body. Monique informs him the riddle is a message from Celeste. Elijah returns to The Abattoir, Marcel told he got everyone looking for Klaus and Rebekah and they get a lifetime of a favor if they find them. Elijah then commands Marcel give him a pen and paper witch troubles Marcel and he asks if he's taking orders from Elijah. Elijah enlists the help of Hayley and Marcel to solve the riddle of the names that Celeste has possessed, like Sabine Laurent. There was a name next to Sabine, Annie La Fleur. Elijah and Marcel decided to go the village where Annie used to live and talked to someone who knew her, he talked about her and what happened to her after she was shunned. Elijah then calls Hayley to update her and told her that Annie drowned herself in the Mississippi and was ready to take over Sabine's body, it is where he and Celeste shared their first kiss. Hayley asks Elijah if he can ask Marcel about Brynne Deveraux as she was the one who cursed The Crescent Wolf Clan 20 years ago and she might have done it as Celeste, she then tells him he's sorry for choosing her instead of his siblings. Elijah told her it was not a choice, as she and her child was going to in the fire at The Mikaelson Mansion. Elijah and Marcel then found a member of Once they go to the church, they were starting to look for the same names that were on his body, he found the name Clara Summerlin who died of Influenza. The riddle was now solved and the names disappeared from his body, but he didn't know what it meant. Back at the compound, Elijah and Hayley were trying to find out where Clara worked and once they found out she was a nurse who worked at a old Sanatorium. Marcel then told him were it was and told him of his and Rebekah's betrayal involving his father In Le Grand Guignol, Elijah enlists the help of Cami to help a recovering Klaus. Elijah removes the blade embedded inside Klaus and leaves him in Cami's care, he knows Cami is one of the few people Klaus wouldn't imminently kill and tells her to convince him not to to murder his sister. Before he leaves he tells Klaus that it was not his desire to bring him pain, but he will not let Klaus hurt her, tells him he'll stop whatever Sabine is planning and he intends to end it. Klaus tells him in his weak state, that he'll pay for this. Elijah visits Monique at the cemetery and tries to make deal with her to find C\u00e9leste Dubois help him stop her her, Monique doesn't trust him and says Celeste has the faith. Elijah convinces her by showing her a body jump spell from his mother's grimoire and says if Celeste tries to switch a body this spell would bring her to her original body. Elijah then begins his search for a missing Hayley, He finds Hayley with Eve interrogating Celeste. Celeste has produced a remedy to the curse placed on Hayley's family. Hayley tells him they plan to keep her hostage until the next full moon, Elijah tells Hayley that it would take an army, he is believes the cure to be another trick by Celeste. Elijah takes Celeste and the cure from Hayley. Elijah was sure she tricked Hayley but she tells him she didn't and it a cure for the werewolves, then once he is sure the cure is safe he returns it to Hayley. Elijah and Hayley share a brief moment, before she leaves with members of the crescent wolves. He kisses her on the forehead, like he did with Katherine months ago. Celeste then told him, that Rebekah and Marcel trying revive Davina, Elijah got angered and showed his fangs and bit her. Elijah takes Celeste back to the Lafayette Cemetery where he finds himself trapped by a boundary spell, Celeste cast for The Originals. Celeste says this body has been a fun ride then says it time switch a body, preparing to jump to a new body Celeste stabs herself in the neck. Monique then appears, now convinced that Celeste was no friend to the witches, points Elijah to Celeste's new body. Celeste is trapped in her newly resurrected original body. She pleads in French to Elijah to show her mercy, he stabs her with Papa Tunde's blade and says in French \"D\u00e9sol\u00e9.\" At the cemetery, he sees Rebekah and then Klaus appears and all three show their vampire faces.

Rebekah then shows up again, she says she will tell him why she did what she did, Klaus tells her that he will hear her out and then he'll give her the punishment she deserves even if he has to go through Elijah to do it. Elijah hears his siblings argue on why she led Mikael to New Orleans, Elijah reminds that Rebekah has stood beside his side for over a 1000 years, which not Elijah himself has done, he then speaks of how Mikael punished him one day so much Elijah actually feared for his brother's life and tried to stop his father, but Rebekah stopped their father with his own sword. Klaus and Rebekah continued to argue and she said if given the choice she would do it again, Klaus got so angry he tried to attack her but Elijah got in between and grabbed the stake from Klaus and told Rebekah to leave them. He then told Klaus how he saw Rebekah trying to kill Mikael in his sleep a 1000 years ago, Klaus thought it was a lie, but Elijah convinced him it was the truth and expressed regret for not killing Mikael himself that night. Klaus dared Elijah to use the white oak stake. Elijah didn't want to kill him, but told him he will make him suffer if that's what it takes to protect Rebekah. Klaus stabbed him with Papa Tunde's blade, as a revenge for doing the same to him, but shortly after that he removes it. Later, Elijah and Rebekah are saying goodbye, as she's leaving town. She knows he doesn't want to join her and he wishes her to find everything she's looking for. In Moon Over Bourbon Street, Elijah isn't happy with Klaus' relationship with Genevieve. Elijah asks Klaus if he still remembers that Genevieve tortured their sister. Klaus responds that she's the one who revealed Rebekah's betrayal. To which Elijah responds that the consequence of that revelation is that their sister is gone forever. Klaus states that apparently Rebekah harbored the desire to leave for quite some time. Elijah tells him that it has been a months since Rebekah left. He needs to stop his ridiculous behavior and channel it into some kind of action. He wanted to be king and now he has to take his responsibility. Elijah tells him that if he can so easily neglect his home he wonders what will become of his daughter. He and Klaus know what it's like to live under the threat of violence. They must work together and make New Orleans whole again. Klaus tells him that it might be too broken to mend. Elijah says that if Klaus won't do anything he will. Elijah calls the representatives of all the factions of New Orleans together at the church. He tears the rules of Marcel apart since they no longer apply. He tells them that they all have one very simple choice, they can work together or they can leave. During the meeting Hayley walks in, she is angry that the city is being divided without the werewolves at the table. She tells him that there won't be a peace if the werewolves aren't included. If they don't get a seat at the table she guarantees them they will all regret it. When Elijah is alone with Hayley she asks him if he excluded the werewolves because of her. Elijah tells her he left them out because they no longer live in the French Quarter. Once the treaty is solidified it will expand to her people. She asks him what she should tell her people in the mean time, 'sit, stay, roll over'. Elijah tells her that he would prefer it if she removed herself from the process altogether. He asks her if she is sure that she shouldn't return to the compound. Hayley scoffs at his request and asks him if he really thinks the baby will be safe there. He responds by asking her if the Bayou is any better. She answers him by saying that the wolves deserve a voice, he knows it's the right thing to do. She then leaves. Elijah is having a drink at a bar when At the party Elijah tells Klaus that he hopes he can keep all the factions from fighting. Klaus toasts with him to a spectacularly boring evening. Francesca sees Elijah and tells him that she has already settle some of the disputes. Elijah agrees to her taking Father Kieran's place as a representative of the human faction. She tells Elijah they should make the best of the time they get to spend together. Diego isn't happy with the presence of the werewolves. His sister was killed by werewolves but Elijah tells him that he'll have to try and make peace with the werewolves despite what happened. Elijah then walks over to Jackson and welcomes him to his home. He tells him that the vampires at the party don't like the werewolves and consider them barbaric. Jackson says that Hayley told him the treaty is very important to Elijah. Elijah confirms this. He tells him that it's so important to him that if anyone tries to dismantle what he's trying to built he'll destroy everything they hold most dear. He then wishes Jackson a wonderful evening and walks away. Later at the party, Elijah asks Hayley to dance. She tells him she's surprised he managed to get Klaus to come. Elijah tells her that he hopes that her daughter inherits her mother's, well everything. Hayley states that it's strange to be back at the compound. Elijah hopes it's not unpleasant. Elijah asks her again if it's not better that she returns. This upsets Hayley. She asks him why she should return. She tells him she's not just going to sit there and knit booties and she wonders when he'll figure that out. Jackson interrupts them and asks if he can have a minute. Elijah tells him he can have it later, but Hayley says he can have this dance, leaving Elijah upset. Elijah since away listen the conversation between Jackson and Hayley. Later in the party there is a confrontation between Oliver and Diego, Elijah stops Oliver threatening its life and Jackson stops Diego holding a dagger pointing his heart, Hayley comes in the stairs and tells Elijah to kill Oliver, she gives a speech about how all they have hurt each other, and killing each other would put an end to war, Elijah understood her point and stops his attack on Oliver, Jackson does the same, suggesting that all together will make the peace treaty. Later, each representative signing the treaty with their blood, Elijah and Hayley look at each other while doing so. Later Elijah wants Klaus to sign the peace treaty. Klaus however thinks the treaty will fail. At the end of the episode he's smiling as he looks at a painting he just made, the city of New Orleans with a full moon. In The Big Uneasy, Elijah is overseeing renovations done to the Abattoir, restoring it to it's former glory when Genevieve approaches and requests the witches be allowed to throw the Feast of the Blessings. Elijah agrees only to satisfy the peace treaty. Elijah approaches the representatives of the Faction requesting their attendance. At the feast Elijah is seen talking to Hayley when a group of musicians walk in. The compelled people say they are Marcel's gift by slashing their wrists, provoking the vampires to kill them due to bloodlust. Elijah fails to stop them before the lights go off and the humans are killed, seeing a sign in blood say 'There Will Be No Peace!' Elijah tracks Marcel down and beats Thierry before he attempts to rip out Marcel's heart. Marcel tells Elijah Klaus is up to something with Genevieve and the Crescent Wolves but this does not stop Elijah. Thierry comes to Marcel's aid only to have his heart ripped out by Elijah, leaving Marcel alive to live with the guilt of his best friends death for eternity as punishment for his violation rather than death. Elijah later confronts Klaus, tired of his brothers manipulations behind his back, warning Klaus that from now on he will do what he wants and Klaus can not stop him. In An Unblinking Death, Elijah has hidden his mother Esther's grimoire from Klaus to avoid any foolish plots Klaus has with the wolves. He refuses to hand it over, thinking Klaus plan could backfire. Elijah meets with the wolves to discuss the deal they made with Klaus about Esther's moonlight ring spell for their pack. Elijah guarantees the alliance will bring anything but a better life. Elijah then realizes the man who drives up is a suicide bomber and tries to vamp-speed him out of the area but fails before the bomb explodes. Elijah is later seen helping the wounded. When Jackson points out it went off where it was being lucky as no one was killed, Elijah realizes the first bomb was engineered to move everyone closer to the main bigger bombs when they explode. Elijah assists Oliver lift a home trailer off Eve, offering to heal her as she never activated her werewolf gene, only for Oliver to say she would refuse it. When Hayley returns Elijah reveals there was a second bomb and Eve died, not knowing she was murdered by Oliver. Earlier talking with Jackson, Elijah considers Klaus plan, and releases Esther's grimoire to Klaus, choosing to side with his brother as he realizes the peace has now shattered, toasting to their eventual victory. In A Closer Walk With Thee, Elijah is seen with Klaus at Father Kieran's wake where people are drinking to celebrate his life rather than mourn. Klaus in a foul mood questions this, only for Elijah to sarcastically state that Klaus process of grief was far better, denial, rage, and hoarding coffins in basements. Hayley joins and Klaus demands her to return to the compound. After Hayley and Klaus argue, Klaus states he wants to finish his bottle of scotch and the next to drown out the nightmares he has been having of their father Mikael. Elijah, stunned, asks him to elaborate. When Klaus tells him to have his laugh, Elijah in a serious face says he finds none of it amusing as Mikael has been haunting his dreams to. The brothers assume it must be the work of a witch and their only suspect is Genevieve. The brothers confront her, only for her to be shocked at the news, promising she will help them. Despite Elijah's protests Klaus lets her as he realizes she wants their trust, and they will need a witch to make the moonlight rings. Genevieve returns to say the Other Side is deteriorating and not just Mikael's ghost is causing trouble, which Klaus confirms after calling Bonnie in Mystic Falls. Elijah is unhappy their father is spending his remaining time tormenting his sons. At Kieran's funeral, Elijah says Hayley looks lovely before she collapses from Monique's hex. After first refusing Genevieve's help, he lets her. After Hayley is saved, she says she met Mikael and he tried to kill her, shocking Elijah. Elijah thanks Genevieve for her help and although he won't forgive her for making Rebekah leave, he would be nicer if she could do him a favor by making Hayley a moonlight ring from his mother's spell book to protect her from the curse after she gives birth. Genevieve agrees to help. Hayley is looking out the window, watching the celebrations for Father Kieran's funeral, Elijah arrives and she tells him that if she dies and they make a feast for that, she'll be very pissed. Elijah approaches her and tells her that she almost did and that in a thousand years, he can't recall a time when he felt so afraid. Hayley says nothing and as Elijah is about to leave, Hayley says his name and he turns to her. Hayley then approaches him and kisses him passionately. After finishing the kiss, they remain with their eyes closed. Elijah disappears. Elijah tries to comfort Klaus over Mikael's hatred, saying he hopes Klaus finds peace when Mikael is gone forever, advising Klaus he should make his peace with Marcel as well. In The Battle of New Orleans, he calls Klaus to tell him that Jackson and Oliver are missing and they realize Marcel is responsible. He and Klaus arrives at the docks and find Jackson still tied to the chair. He finds an explosive and tells Jackson to sit still until they can get rid of it. They see more explosives and they vamp speed out with Jackson before it explodes. He then accompanies Klaus while he is talking to Francesca and they agree to make an allegiance since Marcel is being very vindictive. When Jackson leaves, Elijah and Hayley share a passionate kiss and tells her she will always have a choice. He and Klaus then confront all the vampires that have joined Marcel and Elijah takes on all of them. Elijah is seen having no problem taking all the vampires down and is then attacked by the Correas, who are revealed to be werewolves, and is bitten by two of them. He is told by Marcel that Klaus has a spell put on him and realizes Genevieve is to blame. In From a Cradle to a Grave, Elijah bursts into the church looking for Hayley and screaming her name, he stops dead in his tracks, panting and out of breath as a result of the werewolf bites, and struggles to focus his vision. Eventually, he sees that Klaus is sitting at the sacristy, with Hayley's head resting in his lap, Elijah approaches them, he can't believe what he is seeing, he falls to his knees next to Hayley and realizes that she's dead and Klaus tells to him that she is gone, Elijah starts to cry, which causes Klaus to start to cry too and is also stunned by Klaus when he is offered his blood since he has been bitten. Elijah lays Hayley's body back on the table at the sacristy while Klaus sits nearby, he asks Klaus about Hayley's death and Klaus tells to him that he was bested, Elijah becomes furious with Klaus but he tells to Elijah that they witches have to the baby and that they can save her. They are at the cemetery and realize that the witches have made a spell where they won't be found when they sacrifice Hope. Klaus and Elijah are in the cemetery, still trying to find the baby, they are walking through the maze illusion in the cemetery, using a stone like a piece of chalk in order to mark the tombs that they pass. Klaus says that what they need is focus and Elijah tells him that his only focus right now is the baby and her safety, he got furious again with Klaus and tells him that all is the world that he created, Klaus tries to speak but Elijah interrupts him, Elijah tells him that all of his scheming, the enemies that he have made every single day, Elijah asks to Klaus what did he expect, that the mother would be alive to know her daughter, that they could live and thrive as some sort of family, Klaus tells that that was Elijah's fantasy, not of him. Elijah enraged tells him that the baby and Hayley was their hope, that was their family's hope, trying to catch his breath and continue speaking he says that she is gone, referring to Hayley, with tears in his eyes he tells Klaus that he let her in, trying to hold back tears, he says that he don't let people in that he knew that and that he took her from him, he also says that he needed her and that Klaus broken him, Elijah sits down on the stoop of one of the tombs and puts his head in his hands, Klaus quietly sits down next to him and grips his arm in comfort. Klaus tells Elijah that he can tell to his niece how much he cared for her mother when they save her. Klaus and Elijah are breaking their way through the illusion by destroying the tombs. When they reach a room full of candles, they stop and catch their breath, they realize that they had already gone through the same side twice in that moment Hayley arrives , telling them that need to be smarter, Elijah and Klaus freeze when they heard her and they turn to see her. Hayley stands in the doorway, dazed and exhausted-looking, Elijah and Klaus are shocked to see that she is alive, Elijah rushes over to touch her face to make sure she isn't an illusion, Elijah asks to her how are she there and she numb and dazed tells to them that when she woke up in the church, she felt hunger and that knew what she needed. She says that she can feel her baby, Elijah looks confused, but Klaus realizes what has happened, Hayley died with the baby's blood still in her system and she's in transition and she need baby's blood to become in a hybrid. Hayley tells that she don't care about herself and that she will gonna go find their daughter, she leaves, and Elijah and Klaus rush after her. Later, Hayley, Elijah, and Klaus are still searching through the cemetery for the baby, they turns a corner and see Genevieve holding a knife above the baby's head, Hayley scream in panic and Elijah picks up an urn and lobs it at the witches, which slams against Genevieve's hand and knocks the athame onto the ground. The three run toward them, so Monique and Abigail hold each other's hands and channel the ancestors' power to throw them backwards while Genevieve goes to find the knife. As the witches continue to use magic against them, Elijah and Klaus can see that hundreds and hundreds of the dead witches have come together to protect them as they complete their sacrifice. Klaus and Hayley each run in opposite directions, while Elijah continues to rush straight towards them, in hopes of overpowering them, Hayley finds Genevieve picking up the athame, and starts to fist-fight her to keep her from using it against the baby. She once again knocks the knife out of her hand and into the ground, Klaus gets cornered by the spirits of Papa Tunde's twin sons, who telekinetically throw Klaus into a tomb, shattering it. Hayley knocks Genevieve down and runs toward the baby, but Genevieve casts a pain infliction spell on Hayley, which makes her fall onto her knees. Meanwhile, Monique and Abigail are still using their powers combined powers to channel the full strength of the ancestors, Elijah fights to get close enough to them to get the baby. Klaus pulls himself out of the tomb and angrily rushes toward the action. Klaus sees a wrought iron fence, and breaks off one of the spikes. He throws it forcefully toward Abigail, which impales her through the stomach and kills her, breaking the connection that she and Monique had to the ancestors, Monique quickly runs to grab the athame to finish the sacrifice herself. Klaus and Elijah vamp-speed toward her, but she uses her magic to block them using a wall of fire. Genevieve continues the pain infliction spell to prevent Hayley's interference. Just as Monique is about to sacrifice the baby, she's hit with the Devil's Star, which embeds itself in her stomach. Her body becomes covered in cuts, and she coughs up blood before falling to the ground. Klaus and Elijah turn around to see that Marcel was the one who saved the baby. Before they can say anything, Marcel vamp-speeds to the baby, and then vamp-speeds away with it, Klaus follows after him. Later, Elijah and Hayley are shackling Genevieve in one of the tombs to get information from her, Genevieve then tells them that Esther is behind the plan to kill the baby, Hayley and Elijah just glare at her, Genevieve begins to bleed from her eye, she starts to choke up blood. Hayley watches her for a moment before sighing and stabbing her in the stomach, Hayley walks out of the tomb, as Elijah follows her with his look. Later on, Elijah and Klaus are talking about Hope's security and Hayley intervenes, Hayley takes the decision to send they baby away from them to protect her, she says that they must first make New Orleans a safe place for the baby, Elijah disagree but comes to accept when Klaus tells him that they will make the baby pass for dead, he asks if Marcel kept up his charade. Later, in the nursery, Hayley packs up the baby's bag with the letter she wrote to her. Elijah helps her lift the baby out of her cradle and into her arms. Hayley looks away as Elijah gently sticks the baby's finger with a pin to release a large drop of blood. Reluctantly, Hayley kisses the blood off of her finger to complete her transition. He is seen accompanying Hayley to the memorial to keep up the act that Hope is dead. In Elijah is in his niece's nursery brooding. He is folding up the bedding when Hayley comes in and asks what he's doing. He says the illusion needs to be flawless so they need to put things behind them. She asks what's next - should she and Klaus hold their heads up and say they're ready to try again. She's furious that Later, Klaus tells Elijah his plan but Elijah says they need to know where the stake is. Elijah says for this to work, Hayley and Klaus have to unite and work together. He tells her it's their fight and asks if she's ready for battle. She says as long as Francesca dies, she's in. He promises her the woman's head on a silver platter. Elijah waits in Francesca's yard and her personal guards comes out. Francesca's door flies open and she sees Elijah standing outside. She tells the guards he can't come in and tells her monsters suffer from hubris. He reminds her of Al Capone's fate. He says the devil is in the details and tells her that her home is beautiful and he was glad the preservation society elected to protect it making it public domain so he can come in without invitation. He steps inside and gives her a tight little smile. Back home, Klaus paints in his enemy's blood and asks his brother how many rings are missing. He says just one but tells him that her guard fought valiantly but then Francesca fled. Elijah asks if he let her get away and he says not exactly. He let Hayley have Francesca. Later, he finds Hayley tearing up Hope's Nursery. He asks what happened and she says she killed Francesca while she looked her in the eye and begged for her life while she tore her apart. She says she doesn't feel better and he says that's natural. She says it's not natural and she doesn't want to live like this. He reminds her how much more intense it is to be a hybrid. She says she killed eight wolves before she got to Francesca - she says those were her own people and there was no nobility in that. She says everything has changed. She says she saw the way he used to look at her and the way he looks at her now. She says she was a mother and is now a monster. She cries and walks out past him. Klaus is full of remorse and says he should have accepted Hayley's pregnancy and listened to Elijah. He says his greed cost him his daughter. Klaus tells Elijah that he chases his redemption like a man rolling a stone up a mountain. Elijah says mountains aren't endless, but some are steep. He burns the rings and tells Klaus he needs to go grieve with Hayley. In Alive and Kicking, Elijah searched for the missing white oak stake with Marcel's help. After speaking with In Every Mother's Son, Elijah and Klaus received an invitation from their mother who requested to have dinner at the compound. A mysterious man arrived first as they were setting the table. While speaking with them and insulting them, Elijah remained bewildered by his identity, not believing that they'd met before. Klaus, however, realized it was their brother In Live and Let Die, Elijah trained Gia before participating in an effort to save a group of young untriggered werewolves from being forced to activate their werewolf side by Finn. Concocting a plan with Hayley, In Red Door, with Elijah still as her captive, Esther used her magic to make Elijah relive memories from his past that he had long since buried. She forced him to remember what really happened to the doppelg\u00e4nger, Tatia, a woman in his village he had loved around the time he was turned into a vampire. He was forced to see that he had actually killed her due to his bloodlust as a newly turned vampire. Esther explained that the reason he kept himself so tidy and well-dressed was to try and hide the blood that was on his hands throughout history. Esther than made him see visions of being freed by Hayley, giving him hope when there really was none. She continued this to try and get him to turn away from his immortal life as a vampire and accept her offer to be placed into a new body. In Wheel Inside the Wheel, Esther continued to torment and torture Elijah, slitting his throat with a mysterious blade. Later, Klaus refused Esther's offers while searching for Elijah, eventually finding where she had him chained up. After attacking Esther for going after his daughter Hope, Klaus rescued Elijah and brought him back to the compound where he was incapacitated in an almost coma-like state, suffering from Esther's torture. In Chasing the Devil's Tail, while Elijah suffered from what Esther had done to him, he envisioned his darker more violent and savage vampire side trying to overpower the innocent part of him, in the form of himself as a child. Klaus and Hayley tried to figure out how they could help him and Klaus learned that there was a plant in the forest he could use to help his brother. Eventually finding it, he used the herb and got inside of his brother's head, helping him through the ordeal. Elijah awoke from his state, though still seeming to suffer a little from Esther's efforts. Klaus showed his brother that they had managed to capture Finn and Kol. In The Brothers That Care Forgot, Elijah and Klaus tried to turn their brothers against their mother. When Finn brought up Rebekah, unaware of Elijah's actions, was glad to be back with her brother as he explained their mother's plan to put them all into mortal bodies. Elijah seemed to even be supporting the idea of it, telling her how he'd been forced to see the actions of his past and had even considered excepting the offer. Rebekah soon discovered the dead bodies in the kitchen, shocked by Elijah's strange behavior. She pretended to act normally, noticing that Elijah's behavior was growing more and more suspicious. To protect Hope, Rebekah broke Elijah's neck, incapacitating him. In The Map of Moments, Elijah was brought to their family's vacation house by Rebekah, confused as to why she had to knock him out to bring him there. She told him that he had been acting strange. He was happy to be spending the holidays with Rebekah and Hope as Hayley and Klaus arrived, reuniting with their child. Elijah continued to struggle with what Esther had done to him, being overcome with his violent vampire instincts anytime he became dirty, including when he was stacking logs. Later, Hayley told him about her plan to marry Jackson in a ritual that would give their pack hybrid-like abilities. Elijah was visibly shaken and distraught by the news, as was Hayley. In a moment of desperation and lust, they had sex for the first time. In Gonna Set Your Flag On Fire, Elijah was left at the vacation house with Hope, still suffering from the violent flashes of his past. Camille was brought to the house to be kept safe from Finn and took the opportunity to use her psychiatric skills to try and help him with his troubling mind. Elijah initially brushed her off, sarcastically jabbing at therapist tropes. Trying to distract him instead, Camille suggested they play a trivia game and while Elijah was initially underwhelmed by the suggestion, he agreed to play to avoid having to talk about his relationship with Hayley. Camille was stunned by how good Elijah was at answering trivia questions, having lived through many of them but accidentally spilled a drink on him. Elijah began frantically trying to clean himself off, transfixed in his need to be clean. Camille tried to help when he snatched her hand and assured her that he wasn't nearly as fragile as Klaus believed. He received a call from Angelica Barker, who Rebekah was supposed to take the body of, but he discovered she wasn't there. He told Klaus of the incident, worried about his sister's whereabouts. Later, Elijah stood by a window, suffering from his visions when Camille approached from behind. Lost in his bloodlust, Elijah lashed at her but managed to control himself long enough to leave her alone. That night, Klaus told him to remain at the house and that he'd look for Rebekah alone, much to Elijah's chagrin. Elijah then spoke to Cami, apologizing to her for his behavior and telling her that Rebekah was missing. Due to not being able to help his family in his current state, Elijah agreed to talk to Cami. In Brotherhood of the Damned, Elijah was getting therapy from Camille, telling her about the \"red door\" of his mind that he usually kept his vicious nature behind. He explained that it was a door from his past, to the slaughterhouse in his childhood village and that it's where Tatia had first told him her feelings for him as well as where he brought her body. Elijah went on further to say that his secret of having killed Tatia haunted him, due to Klaus also having loved her and not knowing the truth. Suddenly, Elijah was knocked unconscious by Finn's spell, his mind being brought to an astral plane with the rest of his brothers. The plane was a cabin with animal heads representing each of the brothers, Elijah being represented by a stag, due to his nobility. As the conversation grew more intense, with Finn trying to learn the secret of Hope's survival, Elijah turned the tables by explaining that Finn's representational magic only worked as long as the representations were correct. Elijah assured his brothers that the stag wasn't a correct totem for him since he wasn't as noble as he appeared. To prove it, Elijah admitted that he had murdered Tatia and hid that secret for a thousand years. Finn's magic began to weaken with the reveal, made worse when Klaus forgave Elijah, showing that he wasn't the vicious wolf Finn represented him as. The animal heads began to burn and the plane dissipated, bringing them back to their bodies. In Sanctuary, Elijah, still at their vacation home, spoke to Klaus on the phone. Klaus told him that he would allow Hayley to marry Jackson and alter the wolves into having the powers of hybrids. Elijah was curious about why Klaus would trust Jackson and Klaus told him that they only needed him until after the wedding, giving Elijah visible concern. In The Devil is Damned, Elijah keeps having flashes of 'The Red Door'. He wants it to go away. Cami gives him a list of chores to do. To keep his mind off of it. He gets a phone call from Klaus. Telling him that Finn is on his way. Finn immobilizes him. Elijah finally wakes up and Finn uses his magic to throw Elijah through a wall. He looks at his hand and sees blood. He has another flash of 'The Red Door'. Finn taunts Elijah and Elijah takes off his daylight ring and the safe house blows up. Killing Finn/Vincent and Elijah escapes. In I Love You, Goodbye, Elijah, Cami and Hope head back to New Orleans. He witnesses Jackson and Hope meeting each other for the first time. He has a talk with Hayley. And she tells him she loves Jackson. Elijah although heartbroken lets her marry Jackson. After the wedding Elijah, In They All Asked For You, Elijah has moved out of The Abattoir. He got his own apartment. He asks Gia for help in playing her violin. For a witch named Josephine LaRue. He needs information from her to find out more about the person Rebekah is inhabiting. Elijah and Gia go to Josephine's home. Gia plays for Josephine and she's not impressed. Gia tells off Josephine and Gia plays some of the music she likes. Josephine finally hears them out and Elijah finds out Rebekah is in Eva Sinclair's body. Josephine tells him Eva is an evil witch who kills children witches for their powers. She tells him she will help if he can get Vincent back to the witches. Eventually Elijah and Gia leave Josephine's home. He goes to the cemetery to save Finn/Vincent. He talks to Klaus saying that he can't kill Finn/Vincent. Freya shows up and Elijah and Klaus meet their older sister for the first time. She traps Finns soul in her necklace. She shows them a vision of her being by Dahlia when she was a child. Elijah, Klaus and Freya talk. She tells them she is there to help stop Dahlia. Elijah then meets with Gia again and they go back to Elijah's apartment. Gia flirts with him. And he doesn't say no. Eventually they can't control their lust towards each other. And they have sex for the first time. In Save My Soul, Elijah saves In Exquisite Corpse, Elijah and Gia are first seen having sex. Later they meet Hayley at Josephine LaRue's home. As Gia leaves to get Josephine. Hayley notices something going on with Elijah and Gia. She is very jealous. And Elijah says \"What exactly do you want from me\". Gia and Josephine finally come into the room. They tell Josephine there is an issue with Eva. Josephine tells Elijah that he needs to find Eva and hand her over to the witches so they can kill her. Josephine tells Elijah that the 24 hour hold on Eva/Rebekah is done. And she will kill Eva herself. Elijah is very angry and starts to leave. Josephine tells them off. Later Elijah talks with Hayley and Marcel. Elijah tells them both he will do whatever he has to do to get his sister Rebekah back. A while later Elijah goes to the cemetery to meet Klaus and Freya. Elijah tells them he will be the anchor to get Rebekah's soul back from inside Eva. Klaus later agrees to also become the anchor. And Rebekah's soul finally comes back. In Night Has A Thousand Eyes, Elijah, Klaus, Hayley, Freya and Rebekah are at the compound in the dining room. As they talk about what happened with Hayley, Jackson and Hope. Freya gives them all a potion to drink so Dahlia won't be able to enter their minds. As they all drink the potion. Elijah gives Klaus a cup of the potion and he refuses. Elijah, Klaus and Hayley talk about their next plan. Freya suggests she can use Jackson to track Dahlias magic. Hayley agrees. Later at St. James Infirmary Elijah and Marcel meet Josephine. Elijah and Marcel ask her for her help. To use her magic to make the infirmary a magic free zone. She refuses and Elijah tells her if she doesn't help. She will be considered as an enemy to the In When the Levee Breaks, Elijah and In City Beneath The Sea, at St. Louis Cathedral Elijah meets with In Fire with Fire, Elijah talks to Marcel about In Ashes to Ashes, Elijah covers Gia's body. Where she died at The Abattoir. As he covers her burnt body he gently strokes her face as he cries. As Cami drinks a cup of his blood to heal. After Klaus fed on her. Elijah screams at Cami. Demanding to know why Klaus did what he did to Gia. Cami tells him that the plan wouldn't have worked. That they didn't have the right ingredients to defeat Dahlia. The next morning Elijah sits on the fountain playing with his phone while he stares and cries over Gias body. Cami apologizes to him about Gia. He doesn't believe her. Cami tells Elijah that Klaus will do what ever he has to do to protect his daughter Hope. Elijah being soo sad and very angry. Yells at her saying \"Klaus will do whatever he has to do for Klaus\". He wants to know why Hayley isn't answering her phone just then Rebekah and Marcel enter. Elijah is shocked to see Rebekah in her original body. Marcel tells Elijah that Klaus stole the spell to activate The Crescent Curse. Elijah goes to The Bayou he then finds Klaus and Dahlia knocked out while In For the Next Millennium, Elijah remained bitter with his brother over the following months, often blowing off steam at Marcel's new gym. He also made sure to take care of Hayley every full moon and bring Hope to her. However, during the day before the full moon when Elijah was preparing a dinner for Hayley in the bayou, he was confronted by professional poachers working for Kingmaker Land Development, saying that they were clearing out the wolf infestation in the bayou. Elijah was infuriated by the notion that Hayley may have been one of their victims so he killed them all without remorse, making sure to turn Hope's carriage around so she wouldn't see. Elijah then called up Freya to have her watch Hope while he stopped the hunters from hurting any more wolves. Elijah systematically hunted down the poachers. He discovered a vehicle full of werewolf corpses, worrying that Hayley was among them. In You Hung the Moon, Elijah continued searching for Hayley in the bayou but discovered Jackson instead, having transformed into human form because of the full moon. The two worried that something very well could have happened to Hayley since she would've been back by now if she was okay. They discovered that the company that hired the poachers was run by Lucien Castle, the first vampire Klaus had ever turned. After learning from Klaus that Lucien was in town, Elijah went to his penthouse but was unable to enter due to a barrier restricting any vampire from other sirelines. He questioned Lucien on the werewolf purge and Lucien sarcastically admitted to it. Elijah broke off a piece of a table and threw the wood through the door, into Lucien's neck. It bought Jackson time to run through the barrier and bite Lucien, poisoning him with werewolf venom. Elijah used the leverage of Lucien dying to convince Lucien to let him in. Lucien warned Elijah about the sire war, but Elijah wondered if that meant that Lucien was targeting him, since Lucien's enemy was Tristan de Martel, the first vampire Elijah turned. Lucien could kill Elijah to get to Tristan but Lucien assured him that he wasn't suicidal, aware that Klaus and Rebekah would kill him if he did anything like that. Elijah wasn't convinced by Lucien's claims that a witch had foreseen the doom of the Mikaelsons. In I'll See You in Hell or New Orleans, after seeing another part of the prophecy from Alexis, Elijah discovered that Marcel had been abducted by The Strix, the ancient vampire society Elijah had started centuries ago. Elijah tracked them down to find Aya, and immediately threatened her, questioning why The Strix were in New Orleans. They were interrupted by the arrival of Tristan, who requested to speak to Elijah alone, saying that Elijah's sireline was at stake. Elijah listened while Tristan explained that Marcel was a potential recruit for The Strix. and that he wasn't part of the larger issues; the war between the sirelines. Tristan explained that Lucien was targeting Elijah, so he could bring down Tristan and The Strix. Elijah was unconvinced and assured Tristan that Klaus was dealing with Lucien, though Tristan convinced Elijah to stop Klaus from harming Lucien, as Lucien most likely had information on the weapon that would bring about the end of the Mikaelsons. Elijah grudgingly stopped Klaus from killing Lucien, telling him what he had learned. In A Walk on the Wild Side, Elijah was working out at the gym to get out some anger when Hayley arrived with an invitation she intercepted for him from The Strix, inviting him to a gala. Elijah decided to attend, to learn more about The Strix's intentions for the city. He attended the gala with Hayley who was struck by how all of The Strix were staring at Elijah when he entered, recognizing the patriarch of their sireline. Elijah later watched while Tristan offered Marcel a challenge to see if he was worthy to join The Strix. When the party was interrupted by Klaus and Lucien, Elijah suggested that Klaus leave and that he was drunk. However, a look from Klaus told Elijah that it was an act. After the gala, Elijah discovered that Klaus, Lucien, and Freya had rescued Alexis from The Strix. When she offered to show them more of the prophecy, Elijah fed on her and realized it was poisoned. Alexis died and the following morning Elijah spoke with Tristan, reminding him that he didn't trust him and wanted proof about all of the claims of this sireline war. In The Axeman's Letter, after discovering Aurora had come to New Orleans, Elijah wanted to tell Klaus about a secret from a thousand years ago he himself had only discovered once Esther had opened his Red Door, involving Aurora. Klaus, not wanting to hear some newly discovered secret, brushed him off saying it could wait. They went looking for Aurora but got separated. Nervous about the reunion of his brother and Aurora, Elijah met with Tristan to ask him where Aurora was. However, Tristan himself seemed surprised by the news Aurora was even in New Orleans but asked Elijah if he was really that afraid of what Aurora might have to say to Klaus about the past. Once Tristan said that he wasn't sure where Aurora was but she couldn't be in the city since the first person she would come to would be him, Elijah cryptically said not to be too sure of that. Once Klaus learned the truth of Elijah compelling Aurora to disown Klaus a thousand years ago, he confronted Elijah over what he had done and the effects it had had on the rest of his life. Elijah defended his actions by asking what he was supposed to do at the time, since Aurora was the sister of a powerful lunatic and father had been in pursuit. Elijah reminded him that he alone was the only one to always stand by him but he was done carrying him. The two then engaged in a brutal fight. In Beautiful Mistake, Freya found Elijah and Klaus after their fight, both bloody. The brothers explained that they had a civil conversation about the past and Elijah informed Klaus of Tristan and Lucien's secret alliance. Knowing that they were being played, Klaus and Elijah had called a truce, deciding to turn their anger toward each other toward a more productive direction; destroying their first sired and any threat they brought against the Mikaelsons. Elijah later explained to Freya why Lucien and Tristan, and possibly Aurora, had a mutual hatred toward the Mikaelsons since he compelled them to believe they were the Mikaelsons in the 11th century to make them bait for Mikael. Freya then got a magical warning that Rebekah was in danger. While investigating what was happening with Rebekah, Elijah received a call from Marcel stating that Hayley had been attacked by Shen Min, one of the most dangerous members of The Strix. Elijah advised Marcel to execute Shen Min immediately since letting him live could mean their deaths but Hayley was planning on interrogating him. Freya then had she and Elijah contact Rebekah through astral projection to find that she had returned to her original body. Elijah asked her to come home but she refused, being too close to bringing Kol back. When Elijah told her about the threat they all faced and how Hayley was at that moment facing Shen Min, Rebekah told him to get back there and help Hayley before Shen Min killed her. Elijah told her to get home as quickly as possible before Freya sent him back to New Orleans. Once home, Elijah went to the church where Shen Min was being held to find him about to kill Marcel and Hayley. Elijah impaled him with a piece of wood, before telling him he wanted answers. He grabbed Shen Min by the throat and compelled him to reveal what he The Strix's plans were and learned they were after a weapon to use against the Mikaelsons. When Elijah tried to learn more, Shen Min committed suicide by removing his daylight ring and burning to death, and halting Elijah's investigation. In Out of the Easy, Elijah had Freya try to find Rebekah while telling Marcel to focus on stopping Davina from activating The Strix's weapon. He also grew increasingly suspect of Klaus's rekindled relationship with Aurora, not seeing her as a victim of her brother like Klaus did. Later, Elijah and Klaus called for a Thanksgiving dinner party, inviting Tristan, Lucien, and Aurora to discuss the conflict between them. Once their guests had arrived, Elijah dropped all pretenses and told them he was aware of the alliance between Tristan and Lucien. They all sat down for dinner and Elijah listened while the sired vampires explained their concern for their own safety and their plan to lock the Mikaelsons away to protect their sirelines from destruction. Elijah grew increasingly annoyed by his guests' plans and infuriated after Aurora revealed she had Rebekah dropped to the bottom of the ocean. Before they could attack Aurora, Tristan threatened Freya but Elijah easily subdued him, pushing him against the wall. Klaus and Elijah then decided to interrogate each others' first sired so Elijah spoke with Lucien. Through his interrogation, Elijah learned that Lucien hadn't been aware of Aurora's plans with Rebekah and was only doing what he thought would help him survive. The Mikaelsons then took Tristan captive as leverage against Aurora but she struck back by kidnapping Camille. Elijah nervously asked Klaus if he loved Aurora and if that would get in the way of stopping her. He then looked over the wreckage of their dinner and remembered a similar image in his vision of the prophecy, verifying that the prophecy was still possibly true and looming over them. In The Other Girl in New Orleans, Elijah interrogated Tristan, trying to pry Rebekah's location out of his first sired. When Tristan's mental training kept him from being easily compelled, Elijah decided that they'd have to break Tristan physically before they could mentally, having Hayley use her werewolf bite to poison the Strix leader. Their interrogation continued and Tristan remained resilient despite the intense pain he was going through, warning them that The Strix would descend upon their home to free him. With Freya's help, Elijah managed to break through Elijah's mind enough to see the word \"cepheus\". Soon after, The Strix arrived to rescue their captive leader. Elijah did his best to fight them off, through extracting hearts and decapitating the members of his sireline. Marcel joined in on the fight with his new allies and in the chaos of the battle, managed to sneak up behind Elijah and stake him. With Elijah down, Tristan was freed by Marcel and Aya but not before Marcel revealed to Hayley that he only staked Elijah out of necessity and could have used one of the cursed stakes Rebekah had been put down with but didn't out of loyalty to the Mikaelsons. Elijah awoke to find blood staining his painting in the compound, just as he had foreseen in the vision of the prophecy; another reminder that the downfall of his family was still possibly coming. In Savior, Elijah found the location of Rebekah's body and had it brought up from the sea, going personally to wake her up. Once he had, they discovered the stake she had been put down with had left a lasting hex that started to make her lose control of herself. Gravely concerned, Elijah brought her back to New Orleans in time for Christmas but found that Freya had been attacked by The Strix, poisoned and dying. The Serratura, the weapon Tristan intended to lock the Mikaelsons away with had also been taken from Freya by The Strix. Elijah did his best to help both his sisters as Rebekah also started to lose control of herself, attacking Hayley. Freya seemingly managed to stop the curse that was plaguing Rebekah and the family enjoyed Christmas together. However, Elijah was called to Rebekah out in an alleyway where she showed him that the hex was still active, despite Freya's efforts. Seeing no other option, Rebekah pulled out a dagger and begged Elijah to dagger her for her own and the family's safety until they could find a way to get rid of her hex. Elijah tearfully refused, but after her desperate pleas, he drove the dagger into her heart and neutralized his younger sister. In A Ghost Along the Mississippi, after learning the Cami had been both killed and revived as a vampire by Aurora, Elijah agreed with Klaus that brutal retribution must be taken against the de Martel siblings. However, Elijah stressed that the Serratura be recovered first as it proved to be an immediate and possibly crippling threat to them. He also acknowledged that Freya's pendant housing Finn's spirit had also been taken. Elijah stressed that they focus on stopping the witch Regent that was required to activate the Serratura's power, Vincent. Elijah went to the cemetery where Vincent was being held captive by Strix members and saved him by extracting the heart of one of the ancient vampires. Vincent told him that it was too late and he already been forced to activate the Serratura for Tristan, who used the leverage of threatening to put Finn's spirit back into his body against him. Elijah revealed that he snatched the pendant from one of the Strix captors, showing Vincent that he had no more reason to fear Tristan. Elijah returned to the compound with Vincent to find Freya with a box that had been delivered to the house. Inside was Jackson's removed heart, pulled out by Tristan, who had both Hayley and the now deceased Jackson captive. Elijah understood that if they didn't meet Tristan's demands, Hayley would be next. They discussed what to do about Tristan, realizing that with both the Serratura and Hayley, he had the advantage but Freya suggested capturing Aurora to even the playing field. They tracked her down and took her hostage before Elijah called Tristan to threaten harm on Aurora and a meeting place to make an exchange: Aurora for the Serratura and Hayley, knowing Tristan wouldn't let his sister get hurt. Elijah and Klaus met Tristan and a large number of The Strix in a warehouse for the exchange. After Tristan showed Hayley was alive, the Mikaelsons showed Aurora in a shipping crate. When Tristan went inside to tend to her, he discovered that it was Cami, magically disguised as his sister. Cami activated the Serratura and Tristan couldn't escape the crate. Tristan desperately called for The Strix to attack the Mikaelsons but Elijah gave a warning to his sireline, telling The Strix that if they wanted to fight they could certainly try but many would be killed. He asked them why they would give their lives to avenge a fool and made it clear that he delivered his sireline into existence and he could pluck them out of it. Aya, Marcel, and other Strix members listened to him and abandoned Tristan. Elijah told Tristan they would drop him in the sea where he would drown in darkness for eternity. Elijah then met with Marcel to make it clear that he understood where his real loyalties lie despite his membership in The Strix. He then told him what they did with Tristan and the two toasted to the devil in the deep blue sea. Later, Elijah attended Jackson's funeral in the bayou to support Hayley. In Wild at Heart, despite defeating Tristan, Elijah remained cautious of the looming prophecy and the weapon out there that was capable of killing them, wanting to focus on finding it. Hayley arrived and asked to stay at the compound for a few days, which Elijah gladly obliged before getting a call from Aya. Elijah hoped she was calling from far away but Aya hadn't left, not going until the prophecy was averted and her sireline's safety assured. Aya wanted to pool their resources and work together to find whatever weapon was out there. Elijah went to Aya's hideout where she introduced him to Ariane, a young witch who would be able to piece together the visions Alexis showed Elijah of the prophecy. Ariane used a pool of water to see into Elijah's memories, seeing all of the pain he and his family had endured, and also the darkness that was still to come, giving him cryptic symbols. Elijah went back to the compound and tried to have Klaus help him figure out what her words meant, and realized she was talking about a white oak horse that Klaus had carved when he was a child, that was at the compound. Elijah returned to Ariane to kill her since she knew what the weapon was. Ariane accepted her fate, wanting to be released from the burden of her magic, and Elijah bit down into her neck. He tore her throat out before dropping her into the pool of water. He returned home to find Hayley distraught and grieving for Jackson and he sat with her, keeping her company in her time of loss. In Dead Angels, while Klaus focused on recovering the white oak from Cami, Elijah sought to keep Aya distracted. When Hayley suggested that he should just kill her, Elijah told her that he and Aya had history. He shared that long ago he had found her to be a perfect candidate for immortality and recruited her to be one of the first members of The Strix. She had never forgiven him for abandoning The Strix and hated him for centuries. When asked how he was going to distract her, Elijah told Hayley he was going to put salt in a very old wound. When The Strix held a meeting to discuss the future of their organization and the weapon that could possibly kill Elijah, the group's sire arrived and Elijah made it clear that despite the power vacuum Tristan left, Aya couldn't just ascend to leadership. It was up to Elijah, the creator of the group, to choose the next leader, and he chose himself to retake what was originally his, revealing the original Strix charter, the laws by which the society ran, and it clearly stated power would go back to him if a leader was in doubt. However, Aya didn't accept his claim as founder and invoked another part of the charter, a part that stated succession could be decided by \"a game of kings\", where a contest of strength and cunning could determine the line of succession. She was very familiar with the charter as she helped Elijah write it long ago. She declared whoever held the charter at midnight would be declared the new leader of The Strix. She then challenged Elijah to a duel which he grudgingly accepted. They went to Marcel's fighting ring in St. Anne's church to have the fight where she told him leadership had to be earned and she would have that charter. Elijah rolled up his cuffs and welcomed her to try and get it from him. Despite her impressive skill, she was no match for Elijah's power. During the fight, Elijah chastised The Strix for ever swearing loyalty to a serpent like Tristan. Aya and Elijah debated his actions when he left The Strix with Aya reaffirming her loyalty to Tristan, while Elijah called him an usurper that stole their very dream, and violated everything they once fought for. Aya called him a traitor and said she'd rather die than follow him again. Elijah grabbed her by the throat and accepted her ultimatum before being stopped by Marcel, who stole the charter. Marcel left with the charter, telling Elijah and Aya to catch him if they could by midnight, otherwise, based on the rules they set, he would be in charge of The Strix. Elijah and Aya discussed each having to get to Marcel but Elijah acknowledged he was very popular with the locals and would be difficult to find in his own city. She asked him why he hesitated to kill her during their duel. Elijah brushed off her question, saying he would finish her if the opportunity came again. Elijah found Marcel and spoke to him on the phone, having had Freya track Marcel. Elijah told him to come outside or he'd burn the house he was in to the ground. Instead, Marcel had the owner of the home invite Elijah inside. When Elijah did, Marcel was gone. At midnight, Marcel still had the charter and despite using evasion instead of combat, became the new leader of The Strix. Elijah seemed furious about the results at first, it was revealed to be a ruse by Elijah. He and Marcel had planned for Marcel to be made the new leader, having an ally now controlling The Strix with an army at their beck and call. In Heart Shaped Box, Elijah and Klaus tried to track Aurora down now that she had the white oak. They grew more desperate to find her after she captured Freya to lure them to her. Their search led them into the woods where they split up. Elijah found Aurora in a cabin, having crafted the white oak into bullets. Aurora confronted him and Elijah demanded Freya's location. Elijah threatened Aurora despite her holding a gun filled with white oak bullets. She revealed she was only waiting for Klaus to arrive so he could watch Elijah die. Elijah chastised Aurora's madness and her blaming him for her and Klaus' breakup. She told him that she wanted to kill Elijah so when he died, Tristan would, relieving his suffering at the bottom of the ocean. Klaus arrived with Freya and Aurora prepared to shoot Elijah. She fired but Freya used her magic to deflect the bullet. Elijah then tended to Freya who was wounded by Aurora, while Klaus pursued Aurora. After Klaus and Aurora fought for the gun in the woods and Aurora retook it, she aimed at Klaus to kill him but Elijah arrived. He told Aurora to put the gun down but she fired at him instead, shooting Elijah in the chest with a white oak bullet before fleeing. Klaus shoved his hand into Elijah's chest to remove the bullet, as it hadn't punctured his heart but it grew closer with every beat. Elijah tried to have Klaus leave, and pursue Aurora and stop her instead of save him. Klaus ignored him and was able to remove the bullet. When they returned home, they learned Hayley was attacked by The Strix and tried to take her heart. The heart of an unsired vampire would be able to be used in a spell to unsire the sirelines from the Original Vampires. In A Streetcar Named Desire, Elijah told Freya that he daggered Rebekah, much to her shock and confusion. He told her to make sure his family knew Rebekah's whereabouts, having realized if Aurora had been successful in killing him, Rebekah would have been lost. They discussed the prophecy and the concern that even if Rebekah being daggered by Elijah counted as falling by family, there was still friend and foe to consider. Klaus arrived with Once their consciousnesses were there, they met Tristan and Aurora, who smugly welcomed them. The Mikaelsons realized they were being kept there by representational magic. If they found what represented them, they could escape the mind prison. In reality, Elijah and Klaus's bodies were being kept in the Sisters' pool, being prepared to have their sirelines severed, as Aya was going to kill Klaus to test if the sireline was broken in then Elijah after him. Elijah and Tristan discussed their similarities and differences, and the role Elijah played in Tristan's history. He was grateful for Elijah compelling him to be him for a century, since Tristan learned how not to be Elijah. Aurora tried to turn Klaus on Elijah but Elijah simply scoffed at her remarks, telling her the greatest thing he'd ever done for Klaus was compelling Aurora to leave him. Freya managed to penetrate the Chambre de Chasse as the ritual began in the real world, Elijah and Klaus felt their throats being slit. They realized the queen chess pieces were what represented them, as it was the women they betrayed. Freya woke Elijah up first, mid-ritual, and he immediately started slaughtering the Sisters. They managed to wake Klaus up but Davina finished the spell on him, breaking his sireline. Elijah was left with Aya to deal with, preparing to shoot her with the white oak bullets. He regretfully told her that despite everything they had been through, he couldn't let her hurt his family. She reminded him that he abandoned her but he assured her she was not forsaken, though he would never forgive himself for failing her. Still, he couldn't forgive the damage she had caused to his family. She reaffirmed her previous devotion to him and the pain she had felt that he left her despite her loyalty to him. Telling him to end it, Aya waited as Elijah held the gun to her. His hands trembling, Elijah was unable to pull the trigger. Hayley appeared, killing Aya to avenge Jackson, much to Elijah's surprise. In An Old Friend Calls, Elijah listened to Klaus' nervousness that the members of his now severed sireline would come for him for revenge but Elijah told him to take solace that they had destroyed all of the white oak so his enemy's wouldn't be able to do any permanent damage, but even Elijah wasn't so sure of his own words. Elijah went to check on Hope on Klaus' orders to make sure all of their family was safe. While there, he noticed Hayley acting strangely with suspicious injuries. After returning home, they learned Gaspar Cortez was in town to get retribution on Klaus for past crimes, just as Klaus had feared his former sireline would. Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Davina, and to everyone's surprise, their younger brother Kol. Having been revived by Davina, Kol reunited happily with the family, with Elijah commenting that he hadn't aged a day. They tried to their resurrected sibling up to speed on current events. While Elijah helped his siblings deal with the threat of Gaspar Cortez, he discovered that Hayley had been systematically killing members of The Strix who were involved in Jackson's execution. Elijah tried to convince her to stop with her kill list since it would start a war and implored her to think about Hope's safety. She stormed away, leaving her list of Strix members with him. Later, Elijah returned the list to Hayley, with the rest of the names crossed off, having eliminated the remaining targets himself to spare her the danger and burden. She told him she loved him, even though all he did now was remind him of how she hurt Jackson by being in love with another man. Out of respect for Jackson's memory, she would have to let Elijah go. Elijah understood, telling her it was the right thing to do, and he had even tried it once. With the looming threat of more of Klaus's enemies, the family decided he should leave town with Hope and Hayley until it blew over, leaving Elijah feeling nervous about what was to come. In Alone with Everybody, after learning of Finn's return from Kol and knowing that the last remaining white oak bullet was out there somewhere, Elijah put the compound under lockdown, putting under Strix protection, referring to his family having a \"stay-cation\". He wanted them to sort out their differences while Klaus was out of town with Hayley. However, reconciliation would not be easy, especially given Kol and Finn's past. Elijah confronted his older brother, asking him how Hell had been. Finn told Elijah that the only reason he even considered speaking with him was due to his respect for their sister. Finn proposed that he put aside his vendetta against Elijah and the rest of the family if they allowed Freya to put him back into the body of a witch, as he hated being a vampire again. Elijah considered the proposal, wanting to neutralize any possible threat Finn still posed. However, Elijah was unaware that Kol had been listening in on the conversation. When he found Kol, his younger brother was furious over the idea that Finn would get a happy ending even after murdering him. During their conversation, it became apparent to Elijah that Kol was struggling keeping control of his heightened aggression but he tried to calm his brother. Later, after Marcel had successfully recovered the last remaining white oak bullet, Elijah broke up a fight between Kol and Finn after Finn had been locked into his original body by Davina as vengeance for previously killing Kol. Elijah stopped Kol from setting Finn on fire, prompting his little brother to furiously leave the compound. The remaining siblings tried to decide what to do with the last white oak bullet but Finn got a hold of it. Concerned that his brother would use it on himself to free himself from being a vampire, Elijah tried to talk Finn down from doing anything rash. Finn asked Elijah not to destroy the bullet as it was their last chance of ever being free from their immortality, their last chance of escape. Elijah considered his brother's words while Lucien snatched the bullet and gave it to Elijah. Elijah took Finn's thoughts into account and decided to save the bullet but keep it protected if in the future of any of them wanted to finally end their lives. In Behind the Black Horizon, Elijah and Finn traveled to Mystic Falls after learning Lucien had betrayed them and taken Freya. While they traveled, Finn tried to make Elijah understand the pain of being daggered for centuries and abandoned by his own family. Though initially telling Finn that it was his own fault for being a threat to their family's very existence, he began to understand Finn's pain. Once they arrived back in Mystic Falls, they came across Matt. Matt was surprised to see the Originals again but warned them to leave like all the other vampires he had driven out. Amused by Matt's bravery, Elijah wasn't deterred and told Matt that he needed to find his sister, explaining that Rebekah wasn't their only one. Finn received a vision of Freya's location thanks to a spell from Davina and Kol, and Elijah set off with him into the woods where they found Lucien. Lucien drank the serum he had Freya and Vincent create before Finn and Matt shot him with wooden bullets, apparently killing him. Elijah then gave Freya his blood, healing her. However, Freya revealed that Lucien had drank the serum and killing him had only helped him take the final step into his transformation into something even more powerful than an Original. Lucien rose, with red eyes, and more fangs. Elijah, Finn, and even Matt tried to take Lucien down but he easily overpowered all three of them. He told Elijah that while he had planned on killing Klaus first, now that they were there, he would settle for Elijah. Finn tried to protect Elijah from Lucien but was bitten in the process. Overwhelmed, they only survived thanks to Freya's boundary spell, preventing Lucien from continuing his assault. Lucien told Elijah that he would make his revenge against their family last a long time before fleeing. Elijah and Freya rushed the wounded Finn home, hoping Klaus's blood would heal him like it did most werewolf bites. However, it failed to and Finn died after finally beginning to see the love and loyalty the family had. Elijah could only watch his older brother died with his siblings surrounding him. Elijah and the others gave a few last words for Finn before throwing his ashes into the Mississippi River. They then discovered that Lucien had freed Aurora from where they kept her, and had made a second vial of serum for her. In The Devil Comes Here and Sighs, Elijah, Freya, and Klaus tried to figure out a plan for defeating the newly empowered Lucien but Klaus was more impatient, leaving them to continue planning while he went after his first sired. Lucien captured Klaus and used him as leverage against Elijah, wanting to exchange Klaus for Tristan, or at the very least, Elijah's life so Tristan could be put out of his misery as a favor to Aurora. Elijah and Lucien met in an empty concert hall where Elijah chastised Lucien for being Aurora's errand boy. They began to fight and again Elijah was quickly overpowered by Lucien's new strength. As planned, Freya arrived and trapped Lucien in a sigil, using her magic to hurt him as revenge for him capturing her. Dozens of Strix members arrived and Elijah explained that they would subdue Lucien completely and then bury him under concrete to be rid of him. The Strix all converged on Lucien at once but even that wasn't enough. He easily slaughtered the group and Elijah fled with Freya after knocking Lucien down. They returned to the compound where they found that Aurora was back as their captive. They were hopeful they could use her blood now that the serum was in her bloodstream to figure out a cure for Lucien's bite. In No More Heartbreaks, after Lucien bit Camille to get back at Klaus, she arrived at the compound where Elijah hoped that Lucien's blood could cure his bite just as Klaus's could his. Elijah went with Hayley to get Hope and see if her blood would somehow be able to cure Lucien's bite. On the way there, Hayley stressed how frustrated she was with their loved ones dying but Elijah assured her that they always had to fight for those they loved, even in the face of death. They brought Hope back to the compound but her blood was as ineffective as Lucien's. Freya told Elijah that Cami wouldn't last much longer as the infection was spreading through her. When Vincent and Freya considered putting Cami's soul in a different body, Elijah refused to deny Cami choice, saying she lived her life with grace and she should be able to have it even when dying. With no cure for Lucien's bite, Camille succumbed to Lucien's poison and Elijah put a hand on Klaus's shoulder, quietly standing by to comfort his brother. In Where Nothing Stays Buried, Elijah was met by requests from Kol and Marcel to help bring Davina back since Kol was forced to kill her by the Ancestors. Freya needed to channel power from one of her siblings to help in the ritual of drawing Davina's spirit to safety. However, they soon discovered that Lucien was setting his sights on the daggered Rebekah to draw Klaus out. Elijah surmised that Lucien would still think Rebekah was at the bottom of the ocean, never having known that Elijah had freed her and since daggered her. Elijah went to go move her coffin but Klaus revealed that he had moved her, never liking Elijah and Rebekah sharing secrets among themselves. Elijah demanded to know her new location but Klaus wanted Elijah to stay behind and help Kol from suffering the same loss of a loved one Klaus did. Freya channeled Elijah to draw Davina's spirit into a protective circle. The spell worked and Davina was summoned to the circle, away from the Ancestors. Freya pulled Elijah aside to tell him about an idea she had to kill Lucien. She explained that as long as Davina's spirit was caught between both their world and the ancestral plane, Freya could use her as a conduit to draw power from the Ancestors in order to make Lucien a regular vampire again. However, to take power from the Ancestors she would have to break the circle protecting Davina. Elijah initially refused, knowing that would mean sacrificing Davina to the Ancestors where she would no doubt be destroyed. He called Klaus to explain the situation to him, asking what other choice did they have. Klaus was adamant in finding another way and told Elijah to keep looking. After hearing from The Strix that Lucien was heading to Rebekah's location, he grew desperate, knowing they were out of time. Freya again suggested using Davina to take the power to defeat Lucien. While Marcel spoke with Davina's spirit, Elijah appeared and pinned him to the wall, asking for forgiveness. Marcel struggled before Elijah snapped his neck. Freya went through with her plan, taking the Ancestors' magic but removing Davina's protection. The Ancestors were able to shred her spirit as a result of their actions. Elijah looked on with guilt but Freya told him it had to be done. Elijah and Freya went to the bayou where Lucien was about to kill Hayley and Klaus. Freya used the Ancestors' power to turn Lucien into a normal vampire again, stripping him of his upgraded power. Once he was back to normal, Elijah kicked him to his knees so Klaus could finish him off and tear out his heart. Elijah packed up Rebekah's coffin in the car and as they prepared to get back to Kol and Marcel, Freya told Klaus what she and Elijah did. Klaus and Elijah found Marcel drinking in their home, furious over their sacrifice of Davina. Marcel tearfully told them that they did everything they asked yet they still sacrificed an innocent girl. He told them that everyone was right; the Mikaelsons didn't care about anyone except their family. When Elijah told him that he was their family, he denied it and said he would never be again. Elijah looked on helplessly as Marcel stormed away before silently drinking by himself in guilt over the actions he took, only to be comforted by Hayley. In Give 'Em Hell Kid, Elijah attended Camille's funeral and helped Hayley make sure it was just as Cami would have wanted. When Marcel showed up, still furious about Davina, Elijah told Klaus to give him time but Klaus wasn't so sure since they ruined the one chance to save Davina. Klaus wanted to reach out to Marcel before his anger hardened into something much worse. While Freya tried to use Alexis' skull to see if the prophecy was still a threat, Elijah delved into her mind to see what she saw and discovered that Marcel was the Beast that had been said to destroy their family. Realizing that they had created the threat they had tried to avoid, Elijah and Freya realized Marcel may have given the serum they took from Aurora's blood and given it to Marcel, which would bring about his transformation into the Beast. Determined to not let the prophecy come true, Elijah tracked Marcel and Klaus to the bridge the Mikaelsons crossed when they first brought Marcel home. Interrupting Klaus' attempts to appeal to Marcel, Elijah was direct about his concerns that Marcel had the serum that would transform him into an Upgraded Original Vampire. Marcel was defensive, saying it was typical for one Mikaelson to be trying to make peace while the other was trying to start a fight. Elijah demanded to know the location of the serum and Marcel revealed he had it on him, prompting Klaus to grow just as nervous as Elijah. The Mikaelsons began more aggressively trying to talk Marcel down. Marcel remained steadfast in his determination to resist them, and their need to be at the top, even when they were calling him family. When more of what Elijah saw was beginning to come true, he told Klaus that he saw the part of the prophecy where Marcel would betray them. Marcel spitefully told them that they betrayed him, and that he was a fool for being part of their family. Elijah gave Marcel one last chance to hand over the serum before his visions of the prophecy became too much to ignore and he pulled Marcel's heart from his chest before he could become the Beast, dropping him off the bridge. Elijah and Klaus stood by the riverbank looking for Marcel's body and Klaus was furious at his brother for killing Marcel. He believed he could have convinced Marcel to back down but Elijah defended his actions, telling him that it was the only way to protect them all. Elijah explained Marcel was their friend, he was their family, but after losing Davina he became a powerful foe who could have destroyed them all. Klaus left Elijah wondering if he really believed he had absolutely no choice. He went home, crumbling to his knees in front of Hayley, crying and devastated over taking Marcel's life. Later, while comforting him, he and Hayley slept together. In The Bloody Crown, Elijah remained guilt-ridden over killing Marcel but again told Klaus that it was the only way to ensure the family's safety from the prophecy. When Freya received a warning that members of Klaus' former sireline were converging on New Orleans, Elijah and his brothers found that the compound was under siege and that a revived Marcel was leading the invaders, having already drunken Lucien's serum before Elijah had killed him. They tried to reason with Marcel but he revealed his plans to finally bring down their family for all of the death and destruction they had brought. When Marcel bit Kol with his fatal bite, Elijah jumped into the battle but was beaten down and also bitten by Marcel. Seeing no chance for victory, the Mikaelson brothers fled to Lucien's penthouse where Hayley and Freya were waiting. The family tried to figure out how to survive but things looked bleak, knowing that Marcel's bite was just as deadly as Lucien's had been to Finn and Camille. Elijah started to suffer through the side-effects of the poisonous bite while Klaus went to sacrifice himself to Marcel in a bid to save his family. Elijah and Hayley acknowledged their love for each other as Elijah lay suffering. Freya came up with a plan to put them all into a magical slumber, their lives being linked to Klaus's own, until Hayley could find a cure for Marcel's bite, Rebekah's hex, and the poison Freya had been cut with. The plan worked and all of the siblings were put into their sleep. Freya made it so their consciousnesses could still speak in Chambre de Chasse, allowing her family to spend peaceful time together while sleeping and waiting to be cured. Hayley took their bodies in coffins out of New Orleans, awaiting the time when she could awaken them again. In Gather Up the Killers, after spending five years asleep and linked to Klaus, Elijah was awoken after Hayley found the cure to Marcel's bite. After awaking, he immediately went to Hayley's aid, who was holding off many vampires under the leadership of Alistair Duquesne. Reunited, the two kissed and warmly embraced each other. Hayley saw that Elijah's infection was gone and he thanked her for saving not just him, but the whole family. He inquired about Hope and how she was before deciding with Hayley that there was only one person in the family left to save; they prepared to rescue Klaus from Marcel. In No Quarter, Elijah and his awoken siblings fed on a bus of prisoners and corrections officers to regain their full strength after their long slumber. They then decided how to proceed in freeing Klaus and while Kol suggested that they lure Marcel out of the city before trying anything, Elijah was adamant that they rescue Klaus as soon as possible. Elijah and Rebekah went to Josh, wanting to use him to get to Marcel. However, Rebekah came up with a plan to speak to Marcel herself since she believed he wouldn't hurt her. Elijah tried to convince her otherwise, knowing it would be too dangerous but Rebekah ignored his wishes. While Rebekah distracted Marcel, Elijah led the rest of the family to try and save Klaus. Using a series of tunnels that led to the dungeon Klaus was restrained in beneath the compound, Elijah was gravely concerned when he saw the state his brother was in. While Freya tried to break the magical barrier around Klaus, Elijah kept watch, eventually going up to the compound to try and hold off Marcel while they broke Klaus free. Elijah bravely confronted Marcel even knowing he was outmatched by Marcel's power. Marcel chastised Elijah for coming back to New Orleans even after he barely managed to survive his bite. Elijah told him he was there for Klaus, only infuriating Marcel further, prompting to viciously attack Elijah. While Elijah could hold his own, he was being overwhelmed by Marcel's assault until Hayley arrived to help him. Even together, the two were no match for Marcel, trying to convince him that enough bloodshed had been spilled and they just wanted Klaus back. Marcel remained steadfast in his refusal, preparing to kill them when a freed Klaus arrived, stabbing Marcel with Papa Tunde's blade. Elijah, Hayley, and Klaus took the opportunity to flee. Elijah helped Klaus get to the family's meeting point where Kol and Rebekah were waiting and they all embraced. However, Marcel caught up, threatening to kill them all but Klaus managed to convince him to let them live on the condition that they wouldn't return to New Orleans. Surprised Marcel agreed to the terms, Elijah and the others left New Orleans behind, traveling to Hayley's house. Klaus thanked his family again for not abandoning him to rot before they all proceeded to enter the house. In Haunter of Ruins, Elijah listened as Kol and Freya tried to convince them all to leave Hayley's house as soon as possible to get as far away from Marcel as they could. Elijah wasn't in a hurry, agreeing that Klaus should be able to spend some time with his daughter before uprooting Hope's life. He, along with his siblings, was met by his now seven year old niece. While Klaus bonded with Hope, Rebekah asked him what he was going to do with his immortality now that Klaus had found some peace and redemption with his daughter. Elijah pondered her question and decided he'd have to find his own happiness now, re-affirming his love for Hayley before sleeping together. After Hayley wanted Freya to release Keelin, the werewolf whose venom was used to cure them, Elijah agreed and demanded that Freya let Keelin go. Later, when Hope was feeling unwell, they received a message from Vincent saying he knew what was wrong with her and to come to New Orleans. While Elijah wanted Klaus to stay behind, they all agreed that they would all return to the city for Hope's sake. In Keepers of the House, the Mikaelsons brought Hope to the compound to have Vincent heal her from whatever magical affliction was harming her. Vincent seemed to be successful in curing her, telling the Mikaelsons the best way to thank him was to leave New Orleans. When birds began falling from the sky, forming a symbol around Hope, Elijah watched as she warned them that The Hollow was coming. Elijah went to the church where Vincent was warning the witches about The Hollow and Elijah interrupted the meeting to propose an alliance between he and Vincent to exterminate The Hollow. When Vincent resisted the idea due to Elijah's role in Davina's death, Elijah told him that he would do anything under the sun if it meant rescuing his niece and that Vincent was better off having at least one of the two evils he was up against by his side. Now aligned for the purpose of saving the children The Hollow had abducted, Vincent explained to Elijah that The Hollow could take control of peoples' minds to do its bidding but that he could use the ashes from one of its followers he had encountered to help track it. When Elijah brought up that The Hollow's history with Eva Sinclair, Vincent made it clear that The Hollow could take whatever darkness people kept buried and used it to control them just like it had done to he and his wife, and it could do the same thing to Elijah if given the chance; possibly making him a risk to his own niece. When Vincent discovered that his friend, Will Kinney was serving The Hollow, they confronted him only to find that Will was too devoted to the evil spirit. He tried to murder Vincent but Elijah got in the way and intercepted the bullet before throwing Kinney to the floor. Elijah commented on the monster lurking inside Will, asking him if he wanted to see his own monster within. Elijah tried to use his powers to breach Kinney's mind and find the children but someone had made his mind impenetrable to vampires. When Elijah considered torturing him physically instead, Vincent refused as Will was still his friend and he could break through with his magic if given time. Will broke free and used a talisman to knock away both Elijah and Vincent before escaping, but not before Vincent had tagged him with magic so they could trace him. Tracking Will into the woods, Elijah and Vincent met up with Klaus, Hayley, and a reluctant Marcel. They found The Hollow's servants in the middle of their ritual with the captive children, using the spell to claim more power for themselves. Elijah joined his family and allies in attacking the witches and trying to rescue the kids from the ritual. However, Klaus and Marcel were trapped by The Hollow and Elijah was unable to break through the barrier they were within. Vincent realized that The Hollow wanted them to come, needing an anchor to the living world. The only way they would be able to stop the spell and free Klaus and Marcel was to kill one of the children that was being used in the ritual. Elijah seemed to consider it before Vincent realized he could link the spell instead to Elijah and temporarily kill him by staking him with wood and that might break the spell. Elijah agreed to the plan and let Vincent link him to the spell before Hayley staked him in the heart with a tree branch. The plan worked, freeing Klaus and Marcel, and seemingly defeating The Hollow. Back a the compound, Hayley confronted Elijah about if he had really considered murdering a child if it meant saving his family. When it was clear he had, she told him they had to be better and had to stop putting their family first above everything else all the time. In I Hear You Knocking, Elijah was entrusted to protect Hope on a journey to the bayou with Hayley while Klaus tried to make sure the threat of the Hollow was really over. While walking to Mary's, Elijah and Hayley discussed building a life together and Elijah was hopeful they could live a happy life together, possibly even in the bayou if he exchanged his suits for jean shorts. When they arrived at Mary's, the elder werewolf wasn't happy to see Elijah, reminding Hayley that vampires weren't welcome in her home. Elijah obeyed Mary's wishes and stayed outside. Later, after Mary gave Hayley her husband's journal, she showed Elijah and they discovered he was connected to the Hollow, possibly confirming that the Hollow may have forced him to kill Hayley's parents. While promising Hayley he wouldn't let anything happen to her like it did her parents, Elijah got a call from Freya telling him he needed to get back to the city or Marcel was going to kill Klaus. As the Hollow and its influence kept both Klaus and Marcel trapped in a house trying to kill one another, Freya tried to break in but only could with Elijah allowing her to channel him. When they broke through, Elijah interrupted Marcel and Klaus's fight but Marcel quickly overpowered him. Though Klaus almost listened to the Hollow's orders to kill Marcel, he freed Elijah by just snapping Marcel's neck. Together, Klaus, Freya, and Elijah all saw the Hollow manifest itself before disappearing. When Elijah questioned why Klaus spared Marcel even with a blade that could kill him, Klaus explained that killing Marcel would have given the Hollow what it wanted. They trapped Marcel in the same dungeon he had kept Klaus in for five years. Elijah visited him and explained why he killed Marcel five years ago, comparing it to Klaus sparing him now. He admitted that for a time, he believed Marcel was the key to Klaus's redemption but it's been made clear to him that Hope was actually the only one who really could help redeem him; making Marcel obsolete and no longer welcome in their family. Elijah swore that if Marcel continued to get in the way of his little brother's redemption, he would deliver on him another kind of nightmare. Elijah then left Marcel trapped in the dungeon. In Bag of Cobras, Elijah went to Vincent and made him aware that he had Marcel detained until they could be sure he was free of the Hollow's influence. Vincent hesitantly invited Elijah inside his home to tell him more about the Hollow, and how it had haunted the city for a very long time, always trying to reach out to the living world in violent patterns of four. Elijah suspected that a servant of the Hollow would come to a party at the compound if he threw one, counting on that to root them out. Elijah returned home to help prepare for the party with Klaus, but reminding Klaus not to shed blood as it would only make their situation worse. Elijah urged Klaus to let him handle it, as Klaus had to protected his own image for his daughter's sake, telling Klaus that if anyone should disrupt their kingdom, to have them answer to Elijah alone. That night, once the party had begun, Elijah addressed the attendants, telling them that the party was to celebrate an alliance between the Mikaelsons and Marcel; despite having Marcel captive. Klaus joined him in his speech, telling the crowd that they should put aside any past grievances since the Mikaelsons would only be staying in New Orleans briefly. With the festivities underway, Klaus spoke with Elijah about Vincent helping them expose any potential followers of the Hollow at the party. Once Vincent tracked down the witch Dominic, Elijah reminded Klaus to let him handle Dominic. Elijah requested a private audience with Dominic but Dominic brought two of his allies with him. Vincent joined them but when things between him and Dominic grew too hostile, Elijah snapped the necks of Dominic's allies before telling the enraged Vincent to leave them. Speaking with Dominic alone, the witch told Elijah about the sacrifices and that the children were just the start; the Hollow really needed the power of someone ancient, imbued with magic such as him or the other Original Vampires, settling for Marcel whose power would work just as well. Dominic demanded Elijah hand over Marcel and that he would also take Vincent just as a show of good faith. Elijah knew better than to betray Vincent as it would start a war with the covens. Dominic promised that if Elijah handed over Vincent and Marcel, the Mikaelsons would be spared. Dominic explained that the Hollow wanted to be made flesh again and would not be stopped in getting what it wanted. Elijah turned down Dominic's proposal and attacked him, holding him on the balcony in display of the whole party. He announced that the Originals would remove the Hollow and its disciples from New Orleans; tearing out Dominic's heart and publicly executing him. After the party, when Vincent spoke with Elijah about the show he put on, Elijah reminded him that an alliance between he and Vincent was essential in stopping the Hollow. He then spoke with Klaus, asking him if he had retrieved all of the weapons of the Hollow. Elijah told him about the Hollow's plans for rebirth and with Hayley's help, they learned that the Hollow was searching for its own remains. Elijah realized Dominic had taken Papa Tunde's blade, which turned out to be one of the Hollow's bones; understanding that if the Hollow's followers got to the rest of the bones before they did, they would raise the Hollow who would come for the Mikaelsons. In High Water and a Devil's Daughter, Elijah planned on having Freya cast a barrier spell around the compound to protect his family from the Hollow while he would venture outside to further investigated it, much to Klaus's annoyance. He went to Vincent to discuss a new strategy to keep the Hollow at bay since the Ancestors could no longer hold the force back. Vincent explained that the Ancestors were not gone, just the link to communicating with them was gone. Elijah wanted to re-establish the link but Vincent assured him they could only reconnect with them using The Harvest ritual that Elijah was familiar with. Vincent shot down Elijah's plan but Elijah remained undeterred. He killed four French Quarter witches on consecrated ground with the ceremonial blade, beginning the Harvest despite Vincent's protests, in a desperate move to reconnect with the Ancestors to help defeat the Hollow. Vincent tried to perform the Harvest for Elijah but Elijah's makeshift and rushed set up of the ritual made it difficult. The Ancestors wouldn't accept the attempted offering, making Vincent and Elijah's eyes bleed before magically snapping Elijah's neck. When Elijah woke, he found Vincent using Davina's skull to connect to her spirit, hoping she'd accept the sacrifice and restore the link to the Ancestors. Elijah watched as their Harvest sacrifice was accepted and the new Harvest girls were revived. Vincent criticized Elijah for killing four innocent girls just to get the connection the Ancestors back. Elijah defended his actions, citing that they now had a new ally against the Hollow. Vincent coldly told him that he had no virtue and was a soulless infection to anyone around him, saddened that Hope had to be raised in a family he was part of. Elijah returned home and told Freya that Vincent had restored the link to the Ancestors, hoping that meant they could put the Hollow back in its cage. Freya wasn't as hopeful, having learned that the guardians of the Hollow's bones was a werewolf family and the last member of that family had died: In Voodoo in My Blood, while Elijah prepared to meet They found Alaric on the road, discovering that he had been attacked by the Hollow. When they realized the Hollow was possessing Sofya, Elijah was quick to suggest killing her to neutralize the threat, much to Marcel's chagrin. Instead, Alaric told them about another werewolf family line, where supposedly one of the members was buried with another of the Hollow's bones. Elijah and Marcel went to the tomb where the body lay and found the bone buried with the corpse. Elijah demanded Marcel hand over the bone but Marcel resisted, wanting Elijah to trust him but Elijah threatened him with the knife that Freya had made. Elijah listened as Marcel told him his true colors were showing and that he'd always be a poster boy for believing violence was always the best solution. Hearing this, Elijah lowered the blade and turned to find the Hollow enter the tomb, possessing Sofya's body. The Hollow easily overpowered them, wanting the bone but Hayley intervened. Despite Hayley using her own Labonair blood against the Hollow, the Hollow managed to incapacitate her and take the bone, leaving Elijah, Marcel, and Hayley defeated. When Elijah learned Klaus was being held captive by the ancestral spirit of In Queen Death, Elijah was held captive by the Hollow, with the branch of the rose bush still embedded in his back and it poison from the enchanted thorns slowly killing him. The Hollow told him that she planned on using the death of him, and by extension his sireline, as a sacrifice to bring her back to life, more powerful than ever before. She explained that all she needed were the rest of her body's bones and she would get those, despite his family's attempts to stop her, assuring him that his family would watch him finally die. As Elijah's conditioned worsened, the Hollow threatened to kill Hope, since she was part of her bloodline and potentially capable of destroying her, much to Elijah's fury. After the Hollow left Elijah to be guarded by some of her followers, Elijah's guards were killed by Hayley and Freya. As they tried to free him from the barrier he was trapped within as well as bringing a cure for the thorn's poisons, their efforts were in vain as the Hollow's spirit arrived and began her spell, now that she had collected all of her bones. As she began to sacrifice the dying Elijah, Freya tried to pull his soul into her pendant like she had done with Finn's. Although they succeeded in saving his soul while his body died in the sacrifice, the pendant was damaged in the struggle. Elijah's soul was fractured but still preserved in the pendant, nearly impossible to make contact with. The result of his body and sireline dying allowed the Hollow to resurrect in her physical form. In Phantomesque, Elijah's consciousness remained fractured inside of the damaged pendant and his mind hid itself behind the Red Door that he put all of his most horrific deeds behind. While Freya and Hayley mounted a desperate search for Elijah inside of the pendant, through thousands of years of Elijah's memories, Hayley eventually found him behind the Red Door; though he was lost within the memory of his early days as a violent, almost savage vampire. He nearly harmed Hayley before his mind was brought back together with Hope's help. He spoke to Hayley and Hope, apologizing for his actions before they left him alone in the pendant, his consciousness and spirit no longer shattered. However, they were unable to bring him back to his original body without a sacrifice to power the resurrection, which they hoped could be achieved by killing the Hollow. In A Spirit Here That Won't Be Broken, Freya was able to free Elijah from the pendant. In Voodoo Child, Elijah mourned the loss of his relationship with Hayley. Meanwhile, the Mikaelsons discovered that the Hollow was possessing Hope, and were unable to expel it. When Elijah tried to talk to Hayley, she rebuffed him. In The Feast of All Sinners, Vincent released the Hollow from Hope's body, but was forced to transfer it into Klaus, Rebekah, Kol, and Elijah. With a portion of the Hollow in each of them, the siblings were forced to stay away from each other, since the dark magic inside them would grow in strength the closer they were. Elijah, so loyal and devoted to his family, was worried that he wouldn't be able to stay away from them, so he had Marcel compel him to forget all about his past so he wouldn't be tempted to return. He then went to France and became a piano player, where Klaus saw him from across the bar he was playing at. Elijah didn't recognize him, and continued to happily play music, at peace in the new life he forged, unaware of his past life as an Original Vampire. In Where You Left Your Heart, eight years after being compelled to forget his past, Elijah had set up his new life in Manosque, France and taken a job as a club musician, playing the piano. He's visited by a man, unknown to him as Klaus. They talk and the effects of the Dark Magic that reside in both himself and Klaus begin to manifest, such as the roses in the bar wilting and the water in glasses turning to blood. Sometime later, he's visited by a woman, unknown to him as Rebekah. They speak for a bit, but the effects of their encounter continue to ripple outward in New Orleans. Elijah remained unaware that both visitors were his siblings from his previous life. In Ne Me Quitte Pas, it was revealed how Elijah had ended up in Monosque. Years prior, after Marcel had compelled his memories away, Elijah wandered with no knowledge of who he was. However, due to his hunger and instinctive need for human blood, he quickly discovered that he was a vampire. Elijah believed he was completely alone until he went to New York and bumped into another vampire, Antoinette Sienna. He asked for her help in explaining what they were. Antoinette explained the ins and outs of being a vampire, and he told her how he didn't remember anything about who he was and the farthest back he could remember was that he just woke up starving on a bus six days prior, with nothing but a vague memory of a man, his daylight ring, cufflinks with the letter E engraved on them, and a mysterious note that said \"don't look back\". For weeks, Antoinette helped Elijah re-learn how to be a vampire. However, she was upset when Elijah brought her to a group feed with other vampires he had discovered, explaining that because she was a nightwalker who preferred not to wear a daylight ring and didn't enjoy violently feeding like others, she was a pariah among other vampire groups. They walked in Central Park and Antoinette explained her past, and that taking off the daylight ring allowed her to embrace that she had become an undead creature of the night, wanting to be reminded that she wasn't human and had died before. Elijah was suddenly ambushed by Marcel, who was in New York with Rebekah, and wanted to keep the siblings separated to keep the dark magic at bay. Marcel told Elijah to leave the city, even using his real name, and threatened to kill him and Antoinette if he didn't leave. Elijah recognized Marcel as the face in his memories. Elijah wanted to pursue Marcel so he could find out who he really was. Antoinette, recognizing the danger of Elijah's pursuit for answers, decided to leave him, not wanting to live her life that way. Elijah searched desperately for answers but was unsuccessful. In his confusion and anger, he slaughtered a night club full of vampires and people until Marcel returned. Elijah continued to demand answers but Marcel told him to stop trying to uncover his past, assuring Elijah that Elijah got rid of his own memories for someone, a little girl, and that if he kept digging up his past, she would get hurt. He left after telling Elijah to trust his own decision, and to make a life somewhere else. Elijah went to France and found Antoinette and the two spent the next seven years together, enjoying their life as musicians in a club. Elijah proposed to her but their night was interrupted by Klaus, having come to take Elijah back to New Orleans due to a family crisis. Klaus demanded Elijah return home with him, despite his lost memories, willingly or otherwise. Elijah refused and the two engaged in a fight, as the dark magic within them manifested due to their proximity to one another. Antoinette staked Klaus and she and Elijah tried to run. Klaus quickly recovered and cornered them, telling Elijah his family needed him. Elijah countered by revealing that he had learned who he was some time ago and hated everything he learned about his former life and who he had been. Without the personal memories, he still had knew all about the Mikaelson family, and wanted nothing to do with any of them. Elijah saw his old self as miserable, and refused to be that again. Klaus tried one last time to remind Elijah that they were kings that stood shoulder to shoulder throughout the ages, but Elijah proclaimed that Elijah Mikaelson was dead and snapped Klaus's neck. Later, Elijah realized that Antoinette had known that he was Elijah Mikaelson the whole time. She admitted that she knew he was an Original Vampire and that his family was legendary, and had enemies everywhere, not wanting to say anything so he wouldn't be in danger. She then questioned why he didn't tell her that he learned about his past. He told her Mikaelsons relished in bloodshed and didn't want her to know that part of him. She told him that their pasts and their families don't define them. Antoinette wanted to leave, worried that Klaus would pursue them but Elijah wasn't worried, knowing that when he renounced Klaus, he had broken his brother. Elijah removed his daylight ring, proclaiming his love and devotion to Antoinette, wanting to show her that he was all in on their new life and was completely leaving his old one behind. He knew he couldn't die from sunlight but wanted her to see just how serious he was. He boxed up his old belongings, including his ring, and put them at his feet. He opened the curtains and let the sun set him on fire, saying goodbye to Elijah Mikaelson and burning what was left of his past away. In Don't It Just Break Your Heart, Elijah told Antoinette how much he enjoyed the feeling of sundown without a daylight ring, and how liberating it was. The two then realized they were being followed. Initially believing it might be his family again, they soon discovered it was a strange taking pictures of Antoinette. Antoinette explained he had stalked her before, sometimes even brought her back to her family. She explained that she had met him before, decades ago, in the thirties, and didn't tell him because their families were enemies. Elijah was initially angry that she had lied to him but she explained that she didn't want him to hate her. Later, Antoinette and Elijah played piano together and she told him about their families' bloody history and how she had fallen in love with Elijah when she first met him back in 1933, when he had helped her escape her family. She apologized for lying but reiterated that she loved him and wanted to marry him and move on from their families together. In What, Will, I, Have, Left, Elijah and Antoinette were visited by Antoinette's \"mother\", Greta Sienna. She discussed how she has had to wear a daylight ring to adapt to her surroundings, despite her and her followers' beliefs. Elijah agreed that most vampires probably didn't know the peace that came with abandoning daylight rings and returning to their more instinctual nature. Greta explained that she had come to ask for Elijah's help in helping her son and Antoinette's brother, Roman Sienna, who had become involved with Hope Mikaelson. She knew Elijah was the only one strong enough to stand against Klaus so asked for his help in keeping Klaus from harming Roman, leaving out that she had instructed Roman to abduct Hope. Antoinette didn't think Elijah should get involved with anything involving his family but Elijah swore he'd protect his new family, accepting the task of defending Roman from Klaus. Elijah arrived at the location where Roman had taken Hope, and where, unknown to Elijah, Hayley was also being held captive. Klaus had gotten there first with In God's Gonna Trouble the Water, Elijah and Antoinette were invited to attend a celebration of Greta's life by Emmett and the Nightwalkers who all followed Greta's views of vampire purity. Emmett thanked Elijah for the role he played in Hayley's death, saying that he slayed a hybrid. Emmett told them about the group's hopes of putting the vampires back on top of the city. Elijah wasn't convinced, thinking they didn't have the numbers but was quickly proven wrong when far more Nightwalkers showed up. Elijah and Antoinette left, but were attacked by Klaus who bit Antoinette with his hybrid bite and shot Elijah up with vervain to weaken him, taking them captive. Held prisoner at an abandoned train depot, Elijah discovered Antoinette's bite and her worsening condition. He spoke with Klaus on the phone, demanding that he cure her, or that he would never forgive him. When Klaus brushed off Elijah's threats, Elijah offered him a deal, telling him that he would offer to be restored to the brother he knew if he spared Antoinette's life. Klaus bitterly rejected his offer, considering his brother dead after what happened with Hayley. Elijah promised Antoinette he wouldn't let her die but she worried that regaining his memories would take him away from her, since their seven years together couldn't compare to the thousand with his family. He called Marcel to come and restore his memories. Marcel and Vincent came and tried to undo his compulsion. However, Elijah was unable to open the red door in his mind that contained all of his past memories. To Marcel and Vincent's surprise, Elijah collapsed and didn't wake, like his mind had been taken elsewhere. Unknown to them, Elijah's consciousness had been pulled into a Chambre de Chasse, along with Klaus, much to the brothers' mutual agitation. In The Kindness of Strangers, Elijah discovered that every exit out of the chambre de chasse was sealed. Klaus explained the environment they were in and also questioned why Elijah was still without his memories. Elijah replied that he wasn't sure and that Marcel had failed to undo the compulsion. Despite their hostility, Klaus grudgingly told him that they were square since Elijah got Hayley killed and now Antoinette was going to die because of Klaus's bite. However, Klaus told Elijah that he was going to find his own way out and Elijah was on his own. Soon after Elijah discovered that the remainder of his forgotten siblings, Rebekah, Kol, and Freya were also inside the chambre de chasse with him and Klaus. A door appeared containing a lock for each of them. They each spread out to find the corresponding keys. Elijah searched with Kol, who tried to jog Elijah's memories with his old belongings during their search. Elijah asked Kol why he had never come to visit him in France when Klaus and Rebekah had. Kol explained that the two of them had never had much in common besides their looks, and went on to tell him that Elijah had helped murder his wife. Elijah tried to apologize, and questioned if he ever had. Kol told him that he had in his own particular way but luckily, Davina had come back, while most people weren't so lucky. Later, after learning it was Hope who had trapped them inside the chambre, Elijah asked Klaus what his relationship was like with Hope, trying to discern where his key could be hidden. Klaus told Elijah that he had given Hope her name. Marcel questioned Elijah on why his memories were still gone and Elijah countered that Marcel may have fried his brain with his tinkering or Vincent wasn't a very good witch. Marcel brought up their past together, the good and the bad, but Elijah remained ignorant to it all. Klaus confronted Elijah, accusing him of repressing his memories on purpose. He asked what Elijah remembered when Marcel tried to give him his memories back and he explained that he had tried to open a red door but had been unable to. His entire family questioned why he could so easily forsake them, memory or not, as well as forget about Hayley. Elijah wondered aloud if any of those past feelings had just been a product of being entangled in their vow of always and forever. Klaus argued that this new Elijah had killed his brother, the best friend that had been at his side for a thousand years. Their argument was interrupted as the portions of the dark magic kept within each of them were removed from them and taken back into Hope. While they all reeled from having the Hollow's magic removed, Marcel showed that he had found Elijah's key in a coffin in the basement, recognizing that Hope viewed Elijah as death now after what happened to Hayley. They unlocked the door with their respective keys and found themselves in Elijah's mental maze of doorways. While most left through their own doors, Elijah still couldn't open the red door. Klaus stayed behind to help his brother and the two broke through it together, unlocking Elijah's past and restoring his memories. Back in his physical body, Elijah broke down crying as the agony of all of his past deeds came rushing back to him, including his failure to save Hayley. Elijah broke down in front of his siblings. Later, Klaus gave Elijah the cure to save Antoinette, and though Elijah gave it to her, he apologized to her and left, now knowing who he really was. He dressed himself in his old far more sophisticated attire and went to the bayou, to mourn Hayley alone. In We Have Not Long To Love, Elijah struggled with his returned memories and the guilt he felt over his part in Hayley's death. After Hope refused to speak to him, he went to Rousseau's and spoke with Declan, knowing that he was dating Hayley at the time of her death. Declan, however, was unaware that the man he was speaking to was Hayley's ex. Wanting to ease his own pain, Elijah listened to Declan talk about the loss of Hayley and over the course of the conversation, Declan realized that Elijah was the man that had broken Hayley's heart in the past. Declan asked Elijah what he was doing there and Elijah told him that he wanted to know what Hayley's life had been like while he was away. Hope arrived, in pain from the dark magic she had taken from them that now swelled inside her. It heightened her aggression and she lashed out at Elijah with fury. She used her magic to swipe at him, slashing him repeatedly. Elijah tried to explain that he didn't know who Hayley was when it happened but Hope didn't care, knowing that if Elijah hadn't intervened in Hayley's rescue, she would still be alive. Elijah told his niece that he hated himself now, just as much as she hated him. Klaus intervened, saving Elijah from further injury. Declan questioned what had happened and Elijah told him the truth about the monsters in the city before compelling him to forget everything that had happened, and to know that Hayley was at peace. In There in the Disappearing Light, Elijah went to Vincent to ask his help in curing Hope of the dark magic inside her. Vincent reminded him that Hope had barely survived having that power as a child and now as a budding adult, one human kill away from triggering here werewolf side, it would be even more difficult. Vincent then left Elijah, too busy with witch matters to be able to assist him. Antoinette asked for Elijah's help in talking to Klaus, who had taken Roman to give to Hope, as a way of appeasing the violent power in her. Elijah tried to convince Klaus that letting Hope torture Roman for his crimes against her wasn't going to fix her. Klaus ignored him, believing his loyalty was still with Antoinette rather than the family. Elijah eventually managed to convince Klaus to trust him and asked Antoinette to gather the Nightwalkers. Elijah and Antoinette spoke to the gathered Nightwalkers at the church where they talked about Greta's beliefs of purity but then Elijah told them that they would share Greta's fate. Emmett and the Nightwalkers realized they had been betrayed, but Elijah reminded him that he never said he agreed with Greta's beliefs. Klaus and Hope entered and Hope unleashed her power and killed all of the Nightwalkers, wiping out their enemy while also settling her urges. With the Nightwalkers taken care of and Roman freed, Antoinette decided to leave New Orleans. When Elijah asked where she would go, she reminded him that he'd told her Shanghai was a nice place back when they first met in 1933. They departed, with both hoping they would meet each other again. In Til the Day I Die, Elijah went through old photographs of he and Hayley together and was reminded that he met a woman five years prior in France named Andrea, who he had since realized was Hayley. They shared a dance together and even in that short time when he didn't remember her, they shared a deep connection. Utterly distraught by his own guilt, Elijah decided that he was going to leave New Orleans, not being able to forgive himself, and not expecting his family to be able to forgive him. When he was leaving, he was stopped by Klaus. He told his brother that he had met Hayley five years prior and when he saw her in that farm house, moments before her death, he recognized her as the woman he spent an evening dancing with, but had thought in that moment that she had been some deception sent by Klaus, so had decided not to save her. He acknowledged that he could have and turned to leave. Klaus told him that Hope was dying from the power within her, stopping Elijah but he responded that he was the last person Hope wanted to be there, so could be of no help to her. Prior to leaving, Freya had asked Elijah if he would give her away at her wedding to Keelin. Elijah, too caught up in his own grief, declined and told her that he was in no condition to be sharing in her happy day. However, a letter from \"Andrea\", that Hayley had written him when he was in France reminded him of his love for his own family and he attended the wedding, walking Freya down the aisle with Klaus. He thought about Hayley during the ceremony. He then joined in the celebration, enjoying a peaceful night of happiness with his family. After the wedding, in a moment alone together, Elijah asked Klaus if he had told Hope that she was dying. Klaus said he had tried and broke down. Elijah embraced his brother and the two hugged, worried for the future. In The Tale of Two Wolves, Elijah was told by Marcel that despite Freya and Davina's best efforts, they couldn't find a way to help Hope and that with her first transformation into a werewolf approaching, Hope's condition would worsen and she would die. Klaus, refusing to accept it, brought Hope and Elijah to Mystic Falls believing Caroline's daughters could transfer the dark magic in Hope into him. He trusted Elijah to distract Hope while he carried out his plan. They went to the Salvatore Boarding School for the Young & Gifted and Hope and Elijah talked about Elijah's role as a villain to the people of Mystic Falls years prior. Elijah brushed off the remarks, believing that they were from bias perspectives. Elijah spent the day with Hope, bringing her to the Mystic Grill, and spending the day bonding with her. Hope revealed that she knew she was dying and explained how she blamed herself for Hayley's death, even though she had tried to blame Elijah. She broke down, crying that she had broken the family and wanted her mom. The dark magic brewing in her made her collapsed and Elijah rushed her to Klaus. Later, after Hope had awoken, Elijah apologized that he always saw her as the savior of their family, now regretting putting that burden on her. Hope accepted it and told him that they were both born with responsibilities they didn't deserve. When Elijah happily told her that he saw so much of her mother in her, Hope told Elijah that she had seen Hayley's spirit and Hayley had told her that she was waiting for a dance Elijah had promised her. Though Hope thought it was her subconscious, Elijah knew it was true, since he had indeed promised her a dance. After learning that Klaus planned on taking on the dark magic in Hope and then killing himself to destroy it and save his daughter, Elijah tried to stop his brother. Elijah wanted Caroline's daughters to transfer it to him instead, and then wanted Klaus to kill him, seeing himself as a better option to save both Hope and Klaus. Elijah proclaimed that Hope needed Klaus but Klaus refuted this plan, not wanting to kill Elijah. The two fought and Klaus broke Elijah's neck and tossed him aside. Elijah woke up in a cell and heard the ritual taking place. He rushed outside to find that Klaus had taken in all of the Hollow's magic. He turned the last remaining white oak stake on himself, despite Elijah telling him not to. In When The Saints Go Marching In, Elijah told Klaus to put the stake down. Hope woke up, and realized that the magic had been transferred from herself to her father. Elijah begged Klaus to come back to New Orleans so they could find another way. Klaus refused and prepared to kill himself but Hope knocked him out with magic. They brought him back to New Orleans where Elijah chained him up, and summoned Rebekah and Kol, to tell them about Klaus's condition. Klaus broke out of his imprisonment and Elijah and Freya tried to track him down. Elijah regretted not taking the dark magic himself while he had the chance. Elijah acknowledged that he only ever wanted to ease Klaus's torment and didn't want him to die in a destructive manner, which he would if he wasn't caught. They tracked him down in the French Quarter. Elijah snapped his neck and brought him home. Elijah had Freya temporarily channel some of the dark energy into him and out of Klaus so it could clear his mind. Klaus demanded the stake back but Elijah told him not yet, reminding him that he owed it to his family, and especially to Hope, to at least say goodbye. Klaus thanked Elijah for always trying to make him a better man but wanted to do it his way. While Klaus left, Elijah and the rest of the family gathered to celebrate Klaus's life. Klaus himself showed up, having had a change of heart. They all shared in old stories from throughout the millennia. The whole family wrote wishes for one another and then burned them and Klaus told them all how much he loved them, despite all of the misery he'd brought them throughout the centuries. He said goodbye and left them, to go die his way. Once Klaus was gone, Elijah told them that there was something else they needed to discuss, and told them that he was going to die with Klaus, having fulfilled his life's goal of redeeming his brother. Elijah went with Klaus and Rebekah to the bench he and Klaus had sat on when they discussed the future of the Mikaelsons after Hayley had become pregnant. Elijah watched as Klaus told Rebekah that he and Caroline had the cure for vampirism waiting for her in Mystic Falls and wanted her to live the life she'd always wanted. Rebekah thanked him and hugged him, before hugging Elijah, knowing this would be the last time she saw her brothers. Elijah remained, despite Klaus not wanting his last memory of him to be his death. He didn't want to say goodbye and Elijah agreed, pulling out the white oak stake and snapping it in half. Klaus scoffed, thinking it was a vain attempt to stop the white oak from working but Elijah told him he was aware that the stake would be just as effective. He sat down beside Klaus and told him that he planned to die by his side. Elijah explained that he'd always desired Klaus's redemption, ever since their lives were stolen by Esther and Mikael when they'd been turned into vampires and declared that he was taking their lives back. He went on, telling him that when the family were all celebrating, he saw a future for everyone there except for himself and had realized his sole purpose of his long life was to save Klaus from himself, and now believed he had achieved that. Klaus asked if Elijah really believed that he was redeemed and Elijah assured him that he did. Elijah told him that he had already told the rest of the family that he would follow Klaus into whatever adventure lied beyond. They talked about Hope and how she had the rest of the family looking after her, and acknowledged that she was the very best of Klaus. Elijah handed Klaus his half of the stake. Klaus asked what if there was only darkness in death and Elijah assured him that they would face it together then, as always. Klaus told Elijah that he was grateful to him for always loving him despite not always deserving it. Elijah tearfully told him that it had been a glorious ride, and had been his greatest honor. The two stood in front of one another, and prepared their stakes. They hesitated a moment before nodding to one another, preparing themselves for their deaths. They drove the white oak into each other's hearts at the same moment, and both began to desiccate before flames danced across their faces and they burned to ash, ending their long lives together. Personality[ ] - \"In the beginning, our family was human, a thousand years ago, now. Although our mother dabbled in the dark arts, we were actually just a family trying to survive in a time when it was quite difficult to do so. And, for better or worse, we were happy.\" - Elijah to Hayley in Always and Forever He is known for speaking his mind and having a fierce temper, which he possibly inherited from his father though unlike Mikael, Elijah is capable of controlling it. Elijah very rarely has tolerance for those who broke their words to him, shown when he killed Trevor for betraying him and imprisoned Katherine for her own betrayal. He also has no tolerance for those that disrespect him. He has been shown to go to great lengths to make those that disrespect him suffer, such as Damon, Thierry, and Marcel. When Marcel disobeyed and disrespected Elijah, he killed Marcel's best friend Thierry in front of him so Marcel would suffer that loss for eternity instead of killing Marcel. Elijah is very knowledgeable and deceptive in many ways. This encompasses knowledge of how to fight, wield a sword and defend himself. He exhibits an open-minded and optimistic personality. When he meets Elena, he respects her for her bravery and willingness to put herself in harm's way to protect her loved ones, which is something that Elijah himself has done for his family many times. Elijah in general is a very emotionally hardened character and has difficulty at times handling and accepting certain emotions. This is evident when after losing his family because of Klaus, he turns his sadness and pain into revenge against his half-brother. Elijah is also seen to be uncomfortable and has difficulty accepting romantic feelings, particularly towards Hayley. However, despite this, Elijah does believe in love but also believes that, at least for him, it is rare. He even mentioned that for the thousand years the he has lived, he has only been in love twice. While Elijah is capable of forgiveness, some acts such as betrayal is usually considered unforgivable by him, and even if the betrayer seeks atonement, Elijah has been known to mercilessly kill them. Elijah does have morals, but when ever a member of his family is in danger of being killed, he is forced to commit immoral acts, something he doesn't like to do in the first place, like Klaus, he has a sense of humor. Unlike Klaus, Elijah is caught off guard more easily, even more so when he attacks his opponent(s) in anger. Elijah is most characterized by his devotion to his cause of \"redeeming\" his half-brother; Klaus. As such, he has, with only one known exception, stayed by his half-brother's side, and will constantly search for the good in him, no matter the situation. However, he is not unaware of Klaus' spiteful, violent nature, and is familiar enough with it to predict his younger half-brother's movements. However, with the birth of his niece, his priorities have begun to shift from redeeming him to ensuring her safety. Elijah purposefully seeks to uphold the image of the being he most aspires to be; a well kept, honorable, moral man who is devoted to his family. However, his vampiric nature, as well as insane devotion to Klaus has caused this being to become little more than a facade for him to hide behind. He is just as vicious, just as conniving, just as treacherous, just as dishonorable, and just as hypocritical as his siblings. This is most blatantly shown in his claims of familial loyalty, and then standing aside and permitting Klaus to dagger and abuse them, even helping in the instances of daggering Kol. Elijah is noted for his ability to control his more violent urges, and rarely ever so much allows his face to show its vampiric features. However, after In Season Three, of The Originals, when Elijah learns from Klaus (who learned it from Lucien Castle; the first vampire his half-brother ever sired) that the remaining Original Vampires will fall in one year, unlike his half-brother at first, he realizes that Lucien may be right about the prophecy, he also joins forces with Klaus and Freya to try to stop the prophecy. Unfortunately, his actions result in the Prophecy coming true by the end of the third season. Before he was placed into the slumbering spell by Freya (linking him to Klaus' life force until a cure for an Upgraded Original Vampire's venom is found) Elijah apologizes to Klaus for his actions. Elijah set in motion the fulfilling of the prophecy, Marcel, who was their family and friend, became their foe, and poisoned the Mikaelson siblings in The Bloody Crown. He also corrected Klaus when Klaus stated that he will make Marcel pay for what he did to their family, as Elijah stated everything was his fault, referring to himself being indirectly responsible. In Season Four, now that Klaus has redeemed his nature for the sake of Hope, Elijah now acts as the families enforcer. Elijah has lost most of his previous traits of being honorable, noble, and moral towards humans, vampires and witches alike. He has become utterly ruthless in defense of his family in their war against the Hollow, willing to kill and sacrifice innocent children, such as forcing Vincent to recreate the Harvest Ritual to help stop the Hollow by killing four innocent young girls. Vincent asks if Elijah even remembers how it was to be human, which Elijah responds as no. Elijah's personality has become much darker, his violent and ruthless actions mirroring the other members of his family such as Klaus, Kol, and Mikael. In Season Five, after recovering the memories he lost from Marcel's compulsion, Elijah returns to his old personality. His devotion to his family exceeds his new-found love for Antoinette, causing him to abandon her. Elijah also blames himself deeply for Hayley's death and particularly feels an extreme amount of guilt for depriving Hope of her mother and repeatedly tries to apologize. Without his memories and thus free from his burden of \"always and forever\", Elijah had a more laid back personality, being far less formal and pompous, as well as being more capable of being happy, as he is enjoying his new life with Antoinette after choosing to leave the past behind. Elijah also began to dress more casually, wearing leather jackets and t-shirts instead of expensive suits. Despite holding on to some of his morals, as he was disgusted by his act of killing to feed, he continues to drain his victims despite learning that he can compel them to forget. Elijah also slaughtered everyone in a nightclub when he was searching for answers. The amnesiac Elijah also has a strong dislike for the life he previous had as he tells Klaus that \"Elijah Mikaelson\" wasted his life trying to redeem Klaus and lacked any lasting happiness. Elijah effectively renounces his former life and familial ties, choosing to live with Antoinette and celebrates the occasion by removing his daylight ring and allowing himself to burn. Physical Appearance[ ] - Main article: Elijah Mikaelson/Appearance Elijah is a handsome man who stands about 5'11\" in height, and has a thin but muscular body. He has short brown hair which appeared to have darkened slightly in the fourth season, with hazel brown eyes. His facial features are angular - high cheekbones, a strong jawline, and a straight nose. Despite being centuries old, he appears to be 23 or 24 years old. He is older than his half brother Niklaus, but is younger than his brother Finn and his sister Freya, making him the third oldest sibling of the family. Elijah is similar to his younger brother Kol in facial features, but resembles all of his siblings in a more general way. Elijah in the present day is consistently well-dressed. His wardrobe typically consists of a dress jacket, dress shoes, dress pants, shirt and sometimes a tie. This continues his trend of dressing well throughout the centuries. As a human, he wore more simplistic clothing, along with the other males in his family. But ever since he and his family journeyed to Europe, it seems he upgraded his attire to clothing indicative of a nobleman. Elijah has also worn different hairstyles in keeping with the times. It was revealed that Esther placed in his mind the idea of remaining clean and forgetting about his victims to save him from the guilt of it. Powers and Abilities[ ] As the third oldest of his siblings, Elijah is the eldest His supernatural attributes aside, Elijah's greatest asset is his sharp intellect. His penchant for strategies and forming contingencies way ahead of time easily rivals Klaus', despite this, he has been outsmarted by Klaus on more than one occasion. Often, Elijah is able to discern a great deal of whatever or whoever presented to him after only a few keen observations. He was able to identify Elena masquerading as Katherine when they met at Pennsylvania after seeing her daylight ring and was also the first to discern that his former lover, Celeste, was in fact inhabiting the body of Sabine, and then later formulated a plan with Monique Deveraux to corner her the next time that Celeste jumps into another body. Because he is much more calm, composed, and strategic in battle than Klaus, Elijah is able to fight Klaus almost evenly shortly after being undaggered by Damon despite losing most of his strength from months without blood. His composure also enabled to him to single-handedly subdue Marcel's army without getting so much as a scratch on him, evidence by the lack of cuts on his clothes, something Klaus is unable to do, due to his lack of composure. Due to his long existence, Elijah has seen countless battles and is very experienced in battle. He is also very adaptable as seen in Diego's attempt to flank him, which apparently failed. It is presumed Diego also tried other tactics which also failed miserably against Elijah. Elijah's prowess in combat even allowed him to defeat ancient vampires like members of the Strix with relative ease, even when outnumbered. Elijah has slaughtered vampires and werewolves, alike, most often by ripping out their hearts, ensuring immediate death. Despite his prowess against Klaus and Marcel's army, he has been defeated by lesser vampires before, in fact only two, Stefan and Damon; however, they were using hit and run tactics against him, as well using a stake gun and vervain bombs, which ended in Damon outflanking him and staking him to a door. Also at the time, Elijah underestimated them and showed hubris, believing himself unbeatable. Elijah has not made this mistake since. Elijah also has an extremely high pain tolerance as he didn't even flinch when he used his own body as a makeshift lighter after taking off his daylight ring to kill Finn. Weaknesses[ ] Elijah has the typical weaknesses of an [Original Vampire](/wiki/Original_Vampire). Following the destruction of the [White Oak Stake](/wiki/White_Oak_Stake), it is presumed by all original vampires, that they cannot be killed, however, this seems to be untrue, following the prophecy, as the Beast can kill him. Relationships[ ] [Niklaus Mikaelson](/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson)[ ] - \"We have fought together for centuries, and once again, to break your enemy, you broke your family.\" - Elijah to Klaus in Ashes to Ashes - Main article: Elijah and Klaus Klaus is Elijah's maternal younger half-brother and his closest brother. When they were humans, they both had fun together by battles with swords, much to their father's disapproval. However their relationship became estranged when they both fell in love with the same woman Tatia. After their mother died, Elijah and Klaus made a pact with Rebekah that they would stick together as one, always and forever. In the year 1114, they came across a vampire hunter named Alexander and the Brotherhood of the Five. Alexander and his brothers neutralized four original vampires, but were released (except Finn) by Klaus. In 1492, they met a woman named Katerina Petrova, the first doppelg\u00e4nger of Tatia. Klaus planned to sacrifice her, while Elijah started to have feelings for her. After Katerina's escape, the relationship between Elijah and Klaus was broken for a while. During 2010, Elijah was helping Elena Gilbert and the Salvatore brothers to kill Klaus, while Klaus was preparing to break his curse. After the curse was broken, Elijah met with his half-brother and was about to kill him when Klaus revealed their family was safe and only he knew where they were. Klaus daggered Elijah once they arrived at Alaric's apartment, but eventually Elijah was un-daggered by Damon Salvatore. Later, Elijah had undaggered all of their remaining siblings, but when they were about to leave Klaus for good, their mother appeared. Elijah tried to figure out his mother's motives and once he did, Elijah, Klaus and Kol confronted their mother and their brother, Finn. Elijah left Mystic Falls, while Klaus attempted to locate their lost brother Finn. Later, Elijah came back to bargain with Elena for Klaus' body. After Klaus \"died\", Elijah left again. Once Elijah had possession of the cure, he met with his half-brother again. He later handed his half-brother the [White Oak Stake](/wiki/White_Oak_Stake), asking him to spare Katerina, but Klaus refused. Elijah has began to repair his relationship with his younger half-brother and believes he will find Klaus' redemption through his daughter Hope, Elijah's niece. Unfortunately, Elijah's relationship with Klaus takes a turn for the worst, though it was not a very healthy one to begin with due to actions made constantly by Klaus, when Elijah chose to believe Tyler's lies over Klaus, that he is (supposedly) aware that his child's blood can make hybrids, and he plans to use his child's blood once she is born to make an army of hybrids, to take over New Orleans. He falsely accused Klaus of only caring about his unborn child, so he can use her to sire more hybrids, unfortunately, he finds out the hard way that he was wrong, and unintentionally damages his relationship with Klaus. Though Elijah was well within reason to believe so. Elijah repairs his relationship with Klaus when he apologizes to him for accusing him of only caring about his unborn child so he can used her to sire more hybrids, despite the fact that their relationship is now repaired, Elijah is barely on speaking terms with Klaus. Unfortunately, their relationship becomes worse than ever, when Elijah daggered Klaus and allowed Hayley to try and take Hope away from him, in retaliation Klaus kills his girlfriend Gia, and daggered him with Papa Tunde's Blade, their relationship becomes estranged/broken after this, as they both want nothing to do with each other any more. They reconcile by the end of the third season. [Rebekah Mikaelson](/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson)[ ] - \"I only came to New Orleans to make sure you were safe. You are. I thought that I might be able to convince you to come with me, but here you are, rushing into whatever Klaus and Marcel and the witches have cooked up. And I finally get it. You'll never leave this city. You'll never leave Klaus.\" - Rebekah to Elijah in Fruit of the Poisoned Tree - Main article: Elijah and Rebekah Rebekah is Elijah's younger sister. His relationship with her has been very dysfunctional. Elijah is in the habit of being very critical towards Rebekah due to her actions. After she requests him to give her the cure for the vampirism, Elijah agrees, provided that she go a whole day without her vampire abilities. However, they were tricked by Silas with Klaus' help. After finding out that Klaus is going to be a father, Elijah asks her to follow Klaus and him to New Orleans. She refuses to follow Elijah and help him. Elijah is without a doubt the brother Rebekah respects most out of all her brothers. After 3 months of not hearing anything from Elijah she returns to New Orleans to find Elijah and make sure he's alright. Once she finds him, Elijah tells his sister to protect the wolf carrying Klaus' child, and once he gets home to the Mikaelson mansion he gets a warm welcome from Rebekah. But soon after she tells him that she is leaving town and would ask to come with her, she knows that Elijah would never leave town or Klaus. Unlike Rebekah, Elijah believes that his brother can be redeemed. Elijah also is shown to be very protective of Rebekah, not letting anyone physically harm her. When she is about to be stabbed with Papa Tunde's Blade, he stabs Klaus with it to save Rebekah. He also would not allow Klaus to stake her with the White Oak Stake or harm her in any way. Hayley Marshall-Kenner[ ] - \"We've all done bad things. It's just, most people die before the list gets embarrassing. But, don't for a second compare yourself to Klaus.\" - Hayley to Elijah in Bloodletting - Main article: Elijah and Hayley Season 1: The relationship between Elijah and Hayley began once Elijah was made aware of Hayley's pregnancy with his brother's child. Elijah shows Hayley his family history, to explain how it is possible that she's carrying a Hybrid child. Elijah makes a promise to Hayley that he'll always protect her. A few days later Hayley is reading the journals of Elijah and learns more about him and how he feels about his siblings. When Klaus asks what it is about his brother that inspires admiration, Hayley responds that Elijah was kind to her. Once Elijah and Hayley are reunited, she slaps him and tells him not to make promises he can't keep. The day after when the witches are trying to kill her baby, Elijah tries to do everything he can to undo it and kills the witches who were responsible. One Hayley disappeared, Elijah and Klaus tough Marcel had kidnapped her, they then confronted about it. Elijah finally found Hayley and she tells him about her hybrid baby and what it can do. Elijah confront his brother about what Hayley had told him. It is clear they feel an attraction towards each other, however due to other factors, do not act upon them. After many attempts for them to have their first kiss, when Hayley was about to die because Mikael's threat, Elijah was very afraid of losing her and he decided to opened to her about what he felt, after hearing Elijah's words, Hayley decides to take the first step and kiss him. Season 2: After Hayley and Klaus had to give up to protect her, Elijah and Hayley become estranged. Hayley is upset and angry about Hope leaving and takes some of her angry out on him. In [Rebirth](/wiki/Rebirth), Hayley kills Francesca as a reaction for almost killing her baby. Elijah tries to comfort her and but Hayley starts screaming at him saying that every since she turned into a hybrid she felt extremely different. In the next couple of episodes Elijah tries to help Hayley through her transformation and how she grieves with losing her child. In Red Door, Elijah has a dream about a brunette girl running away from him. Elijah has blood all over himself and he looks like he wants to feed. When the brunette girl turns around you see that it's Hayley who is trying to run away from him. Elijah then feeds on Hayley, who is obviously not a hybrid. In the episodes after this Hayley worries about Elijah and his mental state. In The Map of Moments, Hayley and Elijah finally sleep together after Hayley tells Elijah that she's is going to marry Jackson in order to keep the wolves from turning and having to use the moon rings provided by the witches. Hayley says that she doesn't love Jackson but can't be involved with Elijah and be married to him. Elijah tells Hayley to marry Jackson but then pulls her close and starts to kiss her. In the next episode, Gonna Set Your Flag On Fire, their is a lot of sexual tension with Elijah and Hayley since it's the day after they had sex. In I Love You, Goodbye, it's the day of Hayley and Jackson's wedding day. Elijah wants to tell Hayley that he loves her but Hayley tells him not to, considering that it's her wedding and all. Hope Mikaelson[ ] - \"It was more than a fantasy - it was our hope. It was our family's last hope, and now she's gone.\" - Elijah about losing Hope in From a Cradle to a Grave - Main article: Elijah and Hope Hope is Elijah's niece, and he loves her very much. Even before Hope was ready to be birthed, he was the first person to accept the baby. In Always and Forever, he is the one that wanted the baby to be alive and tried to convince [Klaus](/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson) to accept the child. He has sworn to protect her and love her. They have a strong relationship and he wants nothing more then to let her be safe. That is why he agreed to send her away to live with [Rebekah](/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson) until New Orleans is safe for her to return. Katerina Petrova[ ] - \"I meant what I said about my feelings for you. And I'd like to think that you feel something for me, too. I need you to trust me. I want you to trust me. Just like I'm trusting you. You don't owe me anything. I'm gonna let you decide where we go from here.\" - Katherine to Elijah in American Gothic - Main article: Elijah and Katherine In 1492, Elijah met a woman named Katerina Petrova who was the first doppelg\u00e4nger of Tatia. Elijah and Katerina got to know each other before he introduced her to his younger brother Niklaus. Klaus wanted her to be sacrificed, but Elijah had started to have feelings for her. When Katerina escaped, Elijah felt betrayed by her and started hunting her down, but was mislead the other way thanks to a vampire named Trevor. 500 years later, Elijah finds her stuck inside the vampire tomb and compelled her to stay. Almost a year later, Katerina contacts Elijah and asks him to help her find the cure. During their search for the cure, their friendship grows to be very strong and eventually they fall deeply in love, therefore beginning a sexual relationship. After Elijah discovered that Katerina killed Jeremy Gilbert, he got mad at her lies. Elijah says that he doesn't know who she really is. Katerina then met with him again and handed him the cure, telling him she loves him and she wanted him to trust her, as she is trusting him. During the episode \"The Originals\", Katherine asks him to be with her, instead of heading to New Orleans for a life with Klaus. He doesn't say anything except goodbye, and leaves, after kissing her on the forehead. It is unclear whether their relationship will have a future. Even though he was a hallucination in 500 Years of Solitude, Katherine was happy to see him and had shown to have missed him. He presumably does not yet know that Katherine's dead. Other Relationships[ ] | || | Attitude Toward Humans[ ] Elijah respects human life. He is shown to be generally gentle, kind, caring and considerate with humans, the opposite of his half-brother Klaus, who is shown to have little to no regard for human life. He has not been seen compelling a human except Elena as he needed information from her and Carol Lockwood (for a change of suit). As a vampire, he strongly dislikes the idea of feeding on humans and instead feeds from blood bags. Elijah gives Elena an elixir that has a chance to resurrect the person who drinks it. The elixir was meant for Katerina before she escaped, but now he proffered it to Elena, so she could have had a chance to survive after the sacrifice. Esther, Elijah's mother, however, mentions that he is no better than the others, causing him to reflect that he kills, tortures and manipulates others to get what he wants, mainly to protect his family. Esther says this to Elijah and his two brothers Kol and Niklaus, \"For a thousand years, I've been forced to watch you. Felt the pain of every victim, suffered while you shed blood. Even you, Elijah, with your claim to nobility, you're no better. All of you. You're a curse on this earth. Stretched out over generations.\" When his brother was entombed, Elijah offered Elena a deal to hand Klaus back to him and, in exchange, no one will harm her. After the loss of his brother (Klaus), Elijah and Rebekah hugged for a few seconds. Once Elijah comes to New Orleans, he goes to the bar at Rousseau's and talks with the bartender Camille, about his brother and his family history. Four months later, after being revived by [Davina](/wiki/Davina_Claire), a powerful [witch](/wiki/Witch), he confesses to her that he has a terrible hunger inside after being in the coffin for 4 months, but would not feed from a child. The day after he comes home, he is seen reading a book while an innocent girl is bleeding out, a peace offering from Klaus. Elijah mentions that his forgiveness cannot be bought and says not \"this\" when he mentions the dead girl. After Elijah discovered that he was a vampire after losing his memories, he no longer respected human life. Elijah had no problem feeding off of random humans to keep himself fed and satisfied. After Elijah met his then-fianc\u00e9e Antoinette, he adopted her beliefs when it came to feeding off humans. Like Antoinette, Elijah now feeds and drains his victims of their blood. Appearances[ ] The Vampire Diaries[ ] The Originals[ ] Legacies[ ] Seaon One - Some People Just Want To Watch The World Burn (Photo) Episode Absence[ ] Season Five - In Season Five, Elijah doesn't appear in two episodes: - One Wrong Turn On Bourbon - Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea Name[ ] [Elijah](http://www.behindthename.com/name/elijah)from the Hebrew [](http://www.behindthename.com/support/transcribe.php?type=HB&target=%27E%5E%5Eliy%25ahwu)(eliyyahu) meaning \"YAWEH is my God\".

Elijah was an [Original Vampire](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Original_Vampire). Elijah was the third child and second son of [Mikael](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Mikael) and [Esther](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Esther_Mikaelson). He was the younger brother of [Freya](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Freya_Mikaelson) and [Finn](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Finn_Mikaelson), and the older brother of [Kol](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Kol_Mikaelson), [Rebekah](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson) and [Henrik](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Henrik_Mikaelson) and the older half-brother of [Klaus](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson).

Throughout his long life, Elijah had several romantic relationships. In the early 11th century, Elijah and Klaus were both in love with a [Petrova Doppelg\u00e4nger](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger) named [Tatia](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Tatia). Elijah accidentally killed Tatia after he became a vampire and was traumatized and horrified by the violence of his actions towards her. Elijah's mother, told him to seal the event behind a \"red door\" and to clean himself up. As long as he was clean, nothing of what happened behind the red door could hurt him. As such, this became Elijah's defense mechanism to cope with the horrors of his vampirism for the next thousand years. In the 15th century, Elijah was [romantically](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_and_Katherine) involved with another Petrova Doppelg\u00e4nger, a young girl from Bulgaria, named [Katerina Petrova](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Katerina_Petrova).

In the 21st century, Elijah rekindled his relationship with Katerina Petrova aka Katherine Pierce, before ending it to go to [New Orleans](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/New_Orleans) to help Klaus. In New Orleans, Elijah has developed feelings for Hayley Marshall, after he promised to protect her and the child she was carrying. Elijah respectfully kept his distance while she was married to [Jackson Kenner](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Jackson_Kenner). In the [second season](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Season_Two_(The_Originals)) of [The Originals](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/The_Originals), [he and Klaus](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_and_Klaus) continued to work in a combined effort to stop Esther, Finn and a resurrected Mikael, while struggling with reawakened sins from his past.

However, unknowingly, Elijah completed the prophecy himself, by killing Marcel Gerard. After the latter came back to life as the [Beast](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Upgraded_Original_Vampire) from the prophecy, he bit Elijah and his younger brother Kol, knowing his bite would kill them both. He then banished the Mikaelsons from New Orleans. However, unknown to Marcel, Elijah's older sister Freya linked him and all their siblings to Klaus's life force, giving Hayley time to find cures for them all. In the fourth season, the Hollow used the magic from Elijah's sireline to resurrect herself. Before his death, Freya was able to transfer his soul into a pendant. Elijah was later on restored to his body. However, every vampire in his sireline remained dead. In the series finale, Elijah chose to die once again alongside Klaus when his brother sacrificed himself to destroy the Hollow once and for all.

Elijah had to abandon The Strix to save his family from Mikael but asked Aya to come with him. She refused, staying behind while Elijah fled and Mikael slaughtered The Strix members. By the time Elijah returned, it was too late; Tristan de Martel -together with Aya- took control over the organization. Aya never forgave Elijah for abandoning the group and The Strix were slowly corrupted by Tristan into a more savage, ego-maniacal force than Elijah had ever intended it to be. 1359 [Edit](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Mikaelson?action=edit\u00a7ion=2)[ ] According to [Elijah's Journal](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah%27s_Journal), he had begun noticing [Rebekah](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson) and [Klaus](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson) losing their humanity.

Klaus says that he isn't surprised Elijah doubts his intentions as standing next to the noble Elijah, he will always be \"a liar, a manipulator, a bastard\". telling him everyone including Rebekah and Hayley hangs onto his every word, and no doubt his child will too.

But Elijah explains that, there are consequences for those that care. And tells her, he will not have her pay that price, but Hayley wants to stay. Elijah then asked about the one who watched them. She didn't know but was guessing she left the bible and would be nice if she'd stick around long enough to tell why. He then tells her she came here to gather information about her family and to learn what she can. Elijah has memories of Celeste and Klaus while Hayley is taking care of him. He then says \"Celeste. Forgive me. I'm sorry\". Elijah startles up scared. He screams loudly and Hayley seems worried. Elijah hallucinates and doesn't realize he's harming Hayley. He thinks she's Klaus and wants to kill him. Elijah jumps up and put his hand around Hayley's neck. Hayley starts fighting for air. Suddenly someone stabs Elijah in the back. It's the werewolf Eve. Elijah then appears after being staked. He then tells to Hayley and Eve \"Good evening\". He then tells Eve, he might have something which belongs to her, he shows the stake Eve used to stake him with. Hayley asks if he's okay. he tells her the wound is healed, the fever is broken but for some strange reason he has sharp and lingering sensation in his back. Elijah then asked what had happened and she told him she just met part of her family. They both drove back to the Mikaelson Mansion, Hayley then asked what had happened to Celeste and he showed her. Celeste was laying dead in the bathtub underwater, he then mourned over her and screamed. Elijah told it was difficult time to be a witch and she died because of his brother, but also because of himself as he had abandoned his brother. Hayley didn't get it, and asked why he trying to fix his family when one part of it is broken, but Elijah tells her that the very definition of the word broken can suggest that something can be fixed. Hayley then reaches her hand to Elijah, but tells her no as he doesn't want her to be harmed and then leaves the car to join his siblings in the house. Elijah enters the house as Klaus is about to dagger Rebekah, he stops his brother. Klaus then says maybe Elijah should be daggered with every moment of affection he shows to Hayley and says that if that continues his child will grow up to call him father. Rebekah says that it's Klaus that pushes them away, not the other way around. Klaus then tells Rebekah that every thing he has done is to take back their empire which was taken from them by Marcel and that he has his empire and his new home and will live there while Rebekah and Elijah live in the Mikaelson Mansion and rot. Klaus then gives Elijah the In Elijah senses Eve and goes to her. Eve warns them that if the wolves don't want to be found they won't. She tells them she has something to tell them. In the bayou, Rebekah and Elijah are still talking to Eve. She's got a map showing them the swamp. She tells them about the new wolves that has came into town. She tells them that they are going to want to keep the wolves alive, Elijah asks why and she tells them to see for themselves. Rebekah and Elijah are still in the bayou, looking for wolves. Rebekah makes Elijah admit that he likes Hayley. They hear screaming and see a bunch of wolves running from Diego and some other Vampires. Diego isn't willing to go easily, but Elijah makes it clear that they need to leave or he will kill them. Back at the Mikaelson Mansion, Klaus is playing around on the piano when Rebekah and Elijah come in. He had been informed about their interfering. They found out that the \"son\" was a werewolf and a vampire, the bloodline of the new werewolves is Klaus' bloodline of his real father. He tells them he's had enough of family and leaves. Klaus leaves Rebekah and Elijah alone in the house. Elijah looks sad, defeated. Elijah then visits Hayley and tells her, that the werewolves are safe and then tells her to keep her wolf mark hidden and leaves. He then appears behind Klaus and apologizes for having accused him of having ulterior motives regarding the child, and tells him he was wrong. He then says. \"I'm sorry.\" Elijah then tells him it isn't always easy to love him, Klaus then tells him, he and Rebekah are welcome to join him as it is their family home. In When Klaus discovers that Davina is missing Elijah joins him to find her. When Marcel accuses him for taking Davina, he assures him that he has no desire to harm her in any way. To prove it he tells Marcel that he is worried about how Klaus will operate to get Davina back and they make alliance to work together. Later Marcel and Elijah is seen at the festival, Klaus then joined and later Rebekah trying to find Davina. Klaus assured them they would soon have her. Elijah recognized that tone of voice Klaus had and knew Klaus was planning something. Klaus then kidnaps Davina's friend he stays at his side, playing until Davina arrives. Elijah complains of the music Klaus makes Davina's friend played and Klaus agreed. Marcel then shows up and says When Davina shows up they need to let him do the talking. Davina then arrives and is angry against all of them and attacks them forcing Klaus to turn into his Wolf form and makes Elijah choke out his blood from the victims he has fed on in his 1000 years as an In Sophie about the connection between Davina's drawings about Celeste and the fact that Sophie stole remains from the same person. They are interrupted by earthquake as Davina's power starts to take more serious effects. He and Klaus discuss Davina that she must be sacrificed, Marcel then comes and punches Klaus and tells him, he's not touching her. Elijah tries to calm down Marcel and tells him, he doesn't like to either but tells him that Davina will die either way. Klaus then tells him how As they realize that the only way to protect them from greater harm is to complete the harvest Elijah comes up with plan on his own. He plans to make his mother In He takes Hayley with him to where Thierry told them she was and they found Rebekah laying in a circle spell, which they could not enter. He calls Sophie from his phone and asks how they can enter, she gives some ideas and Elijah then figures out that he could use the blood of Klaus' unborn child to break the spell. When Rebekah is free he breaks Thierry's neck and confronts her and blames her for conspiring against her own blood. Rebekah calls him a hypocrite because he blames her for tearing their family apart, but his own feelings for Hayley are making much more damage to their family. Elijah is later seen a the mansion looking up towards Hayley. In C\u00e9leste tells him that they might make a deal with Elijah, but there will never be any peace as long as Klaus is involved. Elijah asks her to take him on tour so they could talk and soon guesses that Sabine is C\u00e9leste. Elijah tells her how he has put the pieces together which lead him to this notion. They kiss but C\u00e9leste poisons it, because she wants to teach him the error of his ways and break his loyalty to his family. C\u00e9leste weakened him and then makes him choose between his family and Hayley and tells him that he has power to save only one of them. Elijah chooses Hayley and saves her and her friend, Once Hayley is safe he starts looking for his sister but finds only some bloody wolf bodies. Instead of finding Rebekah he encounters Celeste and the other witches, Celeste takes great pleasure that he saved Hayley and left his family in danger. When he is free again he runs to Marcel and orders that every vampire is going to help him find Rebekah and Klaus, and then he plans to kill the witches. In Once they go to the church, they were starting to look for the same names that were on his body, he found the name In Elijah visits Monique at the cemetery and tries to make deal with her to find Elijah was sure she tricked Hayley but she tells him she didn't and it a cure for the werewolves, then once he is sure the cure is safe he returns it to Hayley. Elijah and Hayley share a brief moment, before she leaves with members of the crescent wolves. He kisses her on the forehead, like he did with Katherine months ago. Celeste then told him, that Rebekah and Marcel trying revive Davina, Elijah got angered and showed his fangs and bit her. Elijah takes Celeste back to the In In Elijah calls the representatives of all the factions of New Orleans together at the church. He tears the rules of Marcel apart since they no longer apply. He tells them that they all have one very simple choice, they can work together or they can leave. During the meeting Hayley walks in, she is angry that the city is being divided without the werewolves at the table. She tells him that there won't be a peace if the werewolves aren't included. If they don't get a seat at the table she guarantees them they will all regret it. When Elijah is alone with Hayley she asks him if he excluded the werewolves because of her. Elijah tells her he left them out because they no longer live in the French Quarter. Once the treaty is solidified it will expand to her people. She asks him what she should tell her people in the mean time, 'sit, stay, roll over'. Elijah tells her that he would prefer it if she removed herself from the process altogether. He asks her if she is sure that she shouldn't return to the compound. Hayley scoffs at his request and asks him if he really thinks the baby will be safe there. He responds by asking her if the Bayou is any better. She answers him by saying that the wolves deserve a voice, he knows it's the right thing to do. She then leaves. Elijah is having a drink at a bar when At the party Elijah tells Klaus that he hopes he can keep all the factions from fighting. Klaus toasts with him to a spectacularly boring evening. Francesca sees Elijah and tells him that she has already settle some of the disputes. Elijah agrees to her taking Father Kieran's place as a representative of the human faction. She tells Elijah they should make the best of the time they get to spend together. Diego isn't happy with the presence of the werewolves. His sister was killed by werewolves but Elijah tells him that he'll have to try and make peace with the werewolves despite what happened. Elijah then walks over to Jackson and welcomes him to his home. He tells him that the vampires at the party don't like the werewolves and consider them barbaric. Jackson says that Hayley told him the treaty is very important to Elijah. Elijah confirms this. He tells him that it's so important to him that if anyone tries to dismantle what he's trying to built he'll destroy everything they hold most dear. He then wishes Jackson a wonderful evening and walks away. Later at the party, Elijah asks Hayley to dance. She tells him she's surprised he managed to get Klaus to come. Elijah tells her that he hopes that her daughter inherits her mother's, well everything. Hayley states that it's strange to be back at the compound. Elijah hopes it's not unpleasant. Elijah asks her again if it's not better that she returns. This upsets Hayley. She asks him why she should return. She tells him she's not just going to sit there and knit booties and she wonders when he'll figure that out. Jackson interrupts them and asks if he can have a minute. Elijah tells him he can have it later, but Hayley says he can have this dance, leaving Elijah upset. Elijah since away listen the conversation between Jackson and Hayley. Later in the party there is a confrontation between Later Elijah wants Klaus to sign the peace treaty. Klaus however thinks the treaty will fail. At the end of the episode he's smiling as he looks at a painting he just made, the city of New Orleans with a full moon. In In In Hayley is looking out the window, watching the celebrations for Father Kieran's funeral, Elijah arrives and she tells him that if she dies and they make a feast for that, she'll be very pissed. Elijah approaches her and tells her that she almost did and that in a thousand years, he can't recall a time when he felt so afraid. Hayley says nothing and as Elijah is about to leave, Hayley says his name and he turns to her. Hayley then approaches him and kisses him passionately. After finishing the kiss, they remain with their eyes closed. Elijah disappears. Elijah tries to comfort Klaus over Mikael's hatred, saying he hopes Klaus finds peace when Mikael is gone forever, advising Klaus he should make his peace with Marcel as well. In In They are at the cemetery and realize that the witches have made a spell where they won't be found when they sacrifice Hope. Klaus and Elijah are in the cemetery, still trying to find the baby, they are walking through the maze illusion in the cemetery, using a stone like a piece of chalk in order to mark the tombs that they pass. Klaus says that what they need is focus and Elijah tells him that his only focus right now is the baby and her safety, he got furious again with Klaus and tells him that all is the world that he created, Klaus tries to speak but Elijah interrupts him, Elijah tells him that all of his scheming, the enemies that he have made every single day, Elijah asks to Klaus what did he expect, that the mother would be alive to know her daughter, that they could live and thrive as some sort of family, Klaus tells that that was Elijah's fantasy, not of him. Elijah enraged tells him that the baby and Hayley was their hope, that was their family's hope, trying to catch his breath and continue speaking he says that she is gone, referring to Hayley, with tears in his eyes he tells Klaus that he let her in, trying to hold back tears, he says that he don't let people in that he knew that and that he took her from him, he also says that he needed her and that Klaus broken him, Elijah sits down on the stoop of one of the tombs and puts his head in his hands, Klaus quietly sits down next to him and grips his arm in comfort. Klaus tells Elijah that he can tell to his niece how much he cared for her mother when they save her. Later, Hayley, Elijah, and Klaus are still searching through the cemetery for the baby, they turns a corner and see Genevieve holding a knife above the baby's head, Hayley scream in panic and Elijah picks up an urn and lobs it at the witches, which slams against Genevieve's hand and knocks the athame onto the ground. The three run toward them, so Monique and Abigail hold each other's hands and channel the ancestors' power to throw them backwards while Genevieve goes to find the knife. As the witches continue to use magic against them, Elijah and Klaus can see that hundreds and hundreds of the dead witches have come together to protect them as they complete their sacrifice. Klaus and Hayley each run in opposite directions, while Elijah continues to rush straight towards them, in hopes of overpowering them, Hayley finds Genevieve picking up the athame, and starts to fist-fight her to keep her from using it against the baby. She once again knocks the knife out of her hand and into the ground, Klaus gets cornered by the spirits of Papa Tunde's twin sons, who telekinetically throw Klaus into a tomb, shattering it. Hayley knocks Genevieve down and runs toward the baby, but Genevieve casts a pain infliction spell on Hayley, which makes her fall onto her knees. Meanwhile, Monique and Abigail are still using their powers combined powers to channel the full strength of the ancestors, Elijah fights to get close enough to them to get the baby. Klaus pulls himself out of the tomb and angrily rushes toward the action. Klaus sees a wrought iron fence, and breaks off one of the spikes. He throws it forcefully toward Abigail, which impales her through the stomach and kills her, breaking the connection that she and Monique had to the ancestors, Monique quickly runs to grab the athame to finish the sacrifice herself. Klaus and Elijah vamp-speed toward her, but she uses her magic to block them using a wall of fire. Later on, Elijah and Klaus are talking about Hope's security and Hayley intervenes, Hayley takes the decision to send they baby away from them to protect her, she says that they must first make New Orleans a safe place for the baby, Elijah disagree but comes to accept when Klaus tells him that they will make the baby pass for dead, he asks if Marcel kept up his charade. Later, in the nursery, Hayley packs up the baby's bag with the letter she wrote to her. Elijah helps her lift the baby out of her cradle and into her arms. Hayley looks away as Elijah gently sticks the baby's finger with a pin to release a large drop of blood. Reluctantly, Hayley kisses the blood off of her finger to complete her transition. He is seen accompanying Hayley to the memorial to keep up the act that Hope is dead. | | In Elijah is in his niece's nursery brooding. He is folding up the bedding when Hayley comes in and asks what he's doing. He says the illusion needs to be flawless so they need to put things behind them. She asks what's next - should she and Klaus hold their heads up and say they're ready to try again. She's furious that Later, Klaus tells Elijah his plan but Elijah says they need to know where the stake is. Elijah says for this to work, Hayley and Klaus have to unite and work together. He tells her it's their fight and asks if she's ready for battle. She says as long as Francesca dies, she's in. He promises her the woman's head on a silver platter. Elijah waits in Francesca's yard and her personal guards comes out. Francesca's door flies open and she sees Elijah standing outside. She tells the guards he can't come in and tells her monsters suffer from hubris. He reminds her of Al Capone's fate. He says the devil is in the details and tells her that her home is beautiful and he was glad the preservation society elected to protect it making it public domain so he can come in without invitation. He steps inside and gives her a tight little smile. Back home, Klaus paints in his enemy's blood and asks his brother how many rings are missing. He says just one but tells him that her guard fought valiantly but then Francesca fled. Elijah asks if he let her get away and he says not exactly. He let Hayley have Francesca. Later, he finds Hayley tearing up Hope's Nursery. He asks what happened and she says she killed Francesca while she looked her in the eye and begged for her life while she tore her apart. She says she doesn't feel better and he says that's natural. She says it's not natural and she doesn't want to live like this. He reminds her how much more intense it is to be a hybrid. She says she killed eight wolves before she got to Francesca - she says those were her own people and there was no nobility in that. She says everything has changed. She says she saw the way he used to look at her and the way he looks at her now. She says she was a mother and is now a monster. She cries and walks out past him. Klaus is full of remorse and says he should have accepted Hayley's pregnancy and listened to Elijah. He says his greed cost him his daughter. Klaus tells Elijah that he chases his redemption like a man rolling a stone up a mountain. Elijah says mountains aren't endless, but some are steep. He burns the rings and tells Klaus he needs to go grieve with Hayley. In In In In In In In Rebekah, unaware of Elijah's actions, was glad to be back with her brother as he explained their mother's plan to put them all into mortal bodies. Elijah seemed to even be supporting the idea of it, telling her how he'd been forced to see the actions of his past and had even considered excepting the offer. Rebekah soon discovered the dead bodies in the kitchen, shocked by Elijah's strange behavior. She pretended to act normally, noticing that Elijah's behavior was growing more and more suspicious. To protect Hope, Rebekah broke Elijah's neck, incapacitating him. In In In In In In In In In In In In In In | | In In After learning from Klaus that Lucien was in town, Elijah went to his penthouse but was unable to enter due to a barrier restricting any vampire from other sirelines. He questioned Lucien on the werewolf purge and Lucien sarcastically admitted to it. Elijah broke off a piece of a table and threw the wood through the door, into Lucien's neck. It bought Jackson time to run through the barrier and bite Lucien, poisoning him with werewolf venom. Elijah used the leverage of Lucien dying to convince Lucien to let him in. Lucien warned Elijah about the sire war, but Elijah wondered if that meant that Lucien was targeting him, since Lucien's enemy was In In In In While investigating what was happening with Rebekah, Elijah received a call from Marcel stating that Hayley had been attacked by In Before they could attack Aurora, Tristan threatened Freya but Elijah easily subdued him, pushing him against the wall. Klaus and Elijah then decided to interrogate each others' first sired so Elijah spoke with Lucien. Through his interrogation, Elijah learned that Lucien hadn't been aware of Aurora's plans with Rebekah and was only doing what he thought would help him survive. The Mikaelsons then took Tristan captive as leverage against Aurora but she struck back by kidnapping Camille. Elijah nervously asked Klaus if he loved Aurora and if that would get in the way of stopping her. He then looked over the wreckage of their dinner and remembered a similar image in his vision of the prophecy, verifying that the prophecy was still possibly true and looming over them. In Marcel joined in on the fight with his new allies and in the chaos of the battle, managed to sneak up behind Elijah and stake him. With Elijah down, Tristan was freed by Marcel and Aya but not before Marcel revealed to Hayley that he only staked Elijah out of necessity and could have used one of the cursed stakes Rebekah had been put down with but didn't out of loyalty to the Mikaelsons. Elijah awoke to find blood staining his painting in the compound, just as he had foreseen in the vision of the prophecy; another reminder that the downfall of his family was still possibly coming. In Freya seemingly managed to stop the curse that was plaguing Rebekah and the family enjoyed Christmas together. However, Elijah was called to Rebekah out in an alleyway where she showed him that the hex was still active, despite Freya's efforts. Seeing no other option, Rebekah pulled out a dagger and begged Elijah to dagger her for her own and the family's safety until they could find a way to get rid of her hex. Elijah tearfully refused, but after her desperate pleas, he drove the dagger into her heart and neutralized his younger sister. In Elijah returned to the compound with Vincent to find Freya with a box that had been delivered to the house. Inside was Jackson's removed heart, pulled out by Tristan, who had both Hayley and the now deceased Jackson captive. Elijah understood that if they didn't meet Tristan's demands, Hayley would be next. They discussed what to do about Tristan, realizing that with both the Serratura and Hayley, he had the advantage but Freya suggested capturing Aurora to even the playing field. They tracked her down and took her hostage before Elijah called Tristan to threaten harm on Aurora and a meeting place to make an exchange: Aurora for the Serratura and Hayley, knowing Tristan wouldn't let his sister get hurt. Elijah and Klaus met Tristan and a large number of The Strix in a warehouse for the exchange. After Tristan showed Hayley was alive, the Mikaelsons showed Aurora in a shipping crate. When Tristan went inside to tend to her, he discovered that it was Cami, magically disguised as his sister. Cami activated the Serratura and Tristan couldn't escape the crate. Tristan desperately called for The Strix to attack the Mikaelsons but Elijah gave a warning to his sireline, telling The Strix that if they wanted to fight they could certainly try but many would be killed. He asked them why they would give their lives to avenge a fool and made it clear that he delivered his sireline into existence and he could pluck them out of it. Aya, Marcel, and other Strix members listened to him and abandoned Tristan. Elijah told Tristan they would drop him in the sea where he would drown in darkness for eternity. Elijah then met with Marcel to make it clear that he understood where his real loyalties lie despite his membership in The Strix. He then told him what they did with Tristan and the two toasted to the devil in the deep blue sea. Later, Elijah attended Jackson's funeral in the bayou to support Hayley. In Elijah went back to the compound and tried to have Klaus help him figure out what her words meant, and realized she was talking about a white oak horse that Klaus had carved when he was a child, that was at the compound. Elijah returned to Ariane to kill her since she knew what the weapon was. Ariane accepted her fate, wanting to be released from the burden of her magic, and Elijah bit down into her neck. He tore her throat out before dropping her into the pool of water. He returned home to find Hayley distraught and grieving for Jackson and he sat with her, keeping her company in her time of loss. In However, Aya didn't accept his claim as founder and invoked another part of the charter, a part that stated succession could be decided by \"a game of kings\", where a contest of strength and cunning could determine the line of succession. She was very familiar with the charter as she helped Elijah write it long ago. She declared whoever held the charter at midnight would be declared the new leader of The Strix. She then challenged Elijah to a duel which he grudgingly accepted. They went to Marcel's fighting ring in St. Anne's church to have the fight where she told him leadership had to be earned and she would have that charter. Elijah rolled up his cuffs and welcomed her to try and get it from him. Despite her impressive skill, she was no match for Elijah's power. During the fight, Elijah chastised The Strix for ever swearing loyalty to a serpent like Tristan. Aya and Elijah debated his actions when he left The Strix with Aya reaffirming her loyalty to Tristan, while Elijah called him an usurper that stole their very dream, and violated everything they once fought for. Aya called him a traitor and said she'd rather die than follow him again. Elijah grabbed her by the throat and accepted her ultimatum before being stopped by Marcel, who stole the charter. Marcel left with the charter, telling Elijah and Aya to catch him if they could by midnight, otherwise, based on the rules they set, he would be in charge of The Strix. Elijah and Aya discussed each having to get to Marcel but Elijah acknowledged he was very popular with the locals and would be difficult to find in his own city. She asked him why he hesitated to kill her during their duel. Elijah brushed off her question, saying he would finish her if the opportunity came again. Elijah found Marcel and spoke to him on the phone, having had Freya track Marcel. Elijah told him to come outside or he'd burn the house he was in to the ground. Instead, Marcel had the owner of the home invite Elijah inside. When Elijah did, Marcel was gone. At midnight, Marcel still had the charter and despite using evasion instead of combat, became the new leader of The Strix. Elijah seemed furious about the results at first, it was revealed to be a ruse by Elijah. He and Marcel had planned for Marcel to be made the new leader, having an ally now controlling The Strix with an army at their beck and call. In After Klaus and Aurora fought for the gun in the woods and Aurora retook it, she aimed at Klaus to kill him but Elijah arrived. He told Aurora to put the gun down but she fired at him instead, shooting Elijah in the chest with a white oak bullet before fleeing. Klaus shoved his hand into Elijah's chest to remove the bullet, as it hadn't punctured his heart but it grew closer with every beat. Elijah tried to have Klaus leave, and pursue Aurora and stop her instead of save him. Klaus ignored him and was able to remove the bullet. When they returned home, they learned Hayley was attacked by The Strix and tried to take her heart. The heart of an unsired vampire would be able to be used in a spell to unsire the sirelines from the Original Vampires. In Once their consciousnesses were there, they met Tristan and Aurora, who smugly welcomed them. The Mikaelsons realized they were being kept there by representational magic. If they found what represented them, they could escape the mind prison. In reality, Elijah and Klaus's bodies were being kept in the Sisters' pool, being prepared to have their sirelines severed, as Aya was going to kill Klaus to test if the sireline was broken in then Elijah after him. Elijah and Tristan discussed their similarities and differences, and the role Elijah played in Tristan's history. He was grateful for Elijah compelling him to be him for a century, since Tristan learned how not to be Elijah. Aurora tried to turn Klaus on Elijah but Elijah simply scoffed at her remarks, telling her the greatest thing he'd ever done for Klaus was compelling Aurora to leave him. Freya managed to penetrate the Chambre de Chasse as the ritual began in the real world, Elijah and Klaus felt their throats being slit. They realized the queen chess pieces were what represented them, as it was the women they betrayed. Freya woke Elijah up first, mid-ritual, and he immediately started slaughtering the Sisters. They managed to wake Klaus up but Davina finished the spell on him, breaking his sireline. Elijah was left with Aya to deal with, preparing to shoot her with the white oak bullets. He regretfully told her that despite everything they had been through, he couldn't let her hurt his family. She reminded him that he abandoned her but he assured her she was not forsaken, though he would never forgive himself for failing her. Still, he couldn't forgive the damage she had caused to his family. She reaffirmed her previous devotion to him and the pain she had felt that he left her despite her loyalty to him. Telling him to end it, Aya waited as Elijah held the gun to her. His hands trembling, Elijah was unable to pull the trigger. Hayley appeared, killing Aya to avenge Jackson, much to Elijah's surprise. In While Elijah helped his siblings deal with the threat of Gaspar Cortez, he discovered that Hayley had been systematically killing members of The Strix who were involved in Jackson's execution. Elijah tried to convince her to stop with her kill list since it would start a war and implored her to think about Hope's safety. She stormed away, leaving her list of Strix members with him. Later, Elijah returned the list to Hayley, with the rest of the names crossed off, having eliminated the remaining targets himself to spare her the danger and burden. She told him she loved him, even though all he did now was remind him of how she hurt Jackson by being in love with another man. Out of respect for Jackson's memory, she would have to let Elijah go. Elijah understood, telling her it was the right thing to do, and he had even tried it once. With the looming threat of more of Klaus's enemies, the family decided he should leave town with Hope and Hayley until it blew over, leaving Elijah feeling nervous about what was to come. In Later, after Marcel had successfully recovered the last remaining white oak bullet, Elijah broke up a fight between Kol and Finn after Finn had been locked into his original body by Davina as vengeance for previously killing Kol. Elijah stopped Kol from setting Finn on fire, prompting his little brother to furiously leave the compound. The remaining siblings tried to decide what to do with the last white oak bullet but Finn got a hold of it. Concerned that his brother would use it on himself to free himself from being a vampire, Elijah tried to talk Finn down from doing anything rash. Finn asked Elijah not to destroy the bullet as it was their last chance of ever being free from their immortality, their last chance of escape. Elijah considered his brother's words while Lucien snatched the bullet and gave it to Elijah. Elijah took Finn's thoughts into account and decided to save the bullet but keep it protected if in the future of any of them wanted to finally end their lives. In However, Freya revealed that Lucien had drank the serum and killing him had only helped him take the final step into his transformation into something even more powerful than an Original. Lucien rose, with red eyes, and more fangs. Elijah, Finn, and even Matt tried to take Lucien down but he easily overpowered all three of them. He told Elijah that while he had planned on killing Klaus first, now that they were there, he would settle for Elijah. Finn tried to protect Elijah from Lucien but was bitten in the process. Overwhelmed, they only survived thanks to Freya's boundary spell, preventing Lucien from continuing his assault. Lucien told Elijah that he would make his revenge against their family last a long time before fleeing. Elijah and Freya rushed the wounded Finn home, hoping Klaus's blood would heal him like it did most werewolf bites. However, it failed to and Finn died after finally beginning to see the love and loyalty the family had. Elijah could only watch his older brother died with his siblings surrounding him. Elijah and the others gave a few last words for Finn before throwing his ashes into the Mississippi River. They then discovered that Lucien had freed Aurora from where they kept her, and had made a second vial of serum for her. In In In Freya pulled Elijah aside to tell him about an idea she had to kill Lucien. She explained that as long as Davina's spirit was caught between both their world and the ancestral plane, Freya could use her as a conduit to draw power from the Ancestors in order to make Lucien a regular vampire again. However, to take power from the Ancestors she would have to break the circle protecting Davina. Elijah initially refused, knowing that would mean sacrificing Davina to the Ancestors where she would no doubt be destroyed. He called Klaus to explain the situation to him, asking what other choice did they have. Klaus was adamant in finding another way and told Elijah to keep looking. After hearing from The Strix that Lucien was heading to Rebekah's location, he grew desperate, knowing they were out of time. Freya again suggested using Davina to take the power to defeat Lucien. While Marcel spoke with Davina's spirit, Elijah appeared and pinned him to the wall, asking for forgiveness. Marcel struggled before Elijah snapped his neck. Freya went through with her plan, taking the Ancestors' magic but removing Davina's protection. The Ancestors were able to shred her spirit as a result of their actions. Elijah looked on with guilt but Freya told him it had to be done. Elijah and Freya went to the bayou where Lucien was about to kill Hayley and Klaus. Freya used the Ancestors' power to turn Lucien into a normal vampire again, stripping him of his upgraded power. Once he was back to normal, Elijah kicked him to his knees so Klaus could finish him off and tear out his heart. Elijah packed up Rebekah's coffin in the car and as they prepared to get back to Kol and Marcel, Freya told Klaus what she and Elijah did. Klaus and Elijah found Marcel drinking in their home, furious over their sacrifice of Davina. Marcel tearfully told them that they did everything they asked yet they still sacrificed an innocent girl. He told them that everyone was right; the Mikaelsons didn't care about anyone except their family. When Elijah told him that he was their family, he denied it and said he would never be again. Elijah looked on helplessly as Marcel stormed away before silently drinking by himself in guilt over the actions he took, only to be comforted by Hayley. In Determined to not let the prophecy come true, Elijah tracked Marcel and Klaus to the bridge the Mikaelsons crossed when they first brought Marcel home. Interrupting Klaus' attempts to appeal to Marcel, Elijah was direct about his concerns that Marcel had the serum that would transform him into an Upgraded Original Vampire. Marcel was defensive, saying it was typical for one Mikaelson to be trying to make peace while the other was trying to start a fight. Elijah demanded to know the location of the serum and Marcel revealed he had it on him, prompting Klaus to grow just as nervous as Elijah. The Mikaelsons began more aggressively trying to talk Marcel down. Marcel remained steadfast in his determination to resist them, and their need to be at the top, even when they were calling him family. When more of what Elijah saw was beginning to come true, he told Klaus that he saw the part of the prophecy where Marcel would betray them. Marcel spitefully told them that they betrayed him, and that he was a fool for being part of their family. Elijah gave Marcel one last chance to hand over the serum before his visions of the prophecy became too much to ignore and he pulled Marcel's heart from his chest before he could become the Beast, dropping him off the bridge. Elijah and Klaus stood by the riverbank looking for Marcel's body and Klaus was furious at his brother for killing Marcel. He believed he could have convinced Marcel to back down but Elijah defended his actions, telling him that it was the only way to protect them all. Elijah explained Marcel was their friend, he was their family, but after losing Davina he became a powerful foe who could have destroyed them all. Klaus left Elijah wondering if he really believed he had absolutely no choice. He went home, crumbling to his knees in front of Hayley, crying and devastated over taking Marcel's life. Later, while comforting him, he and Hayley slept together. In The family tried to figure out how to survive but things looked bleak, knowing that Marcel's bite was just as deadly as Lucien's had been to Finn and Camille. Elijah started to suffer through the side-effects of the poisonous bite while Klaus went to sacrifice himself to Marcel in a bid to save his family. Elijah and Hayley acknowledged their love for each other as Elijah lay suffering. Freya came up with a plan to put them all into a magical slumber, their lives being linked to Klaus's own, until Hayley could find a cure for Marcel's bite, Rebekah's hex, and the poison Freya had been cut with. The plan worked and all of the siblings were put into their sleep. Freya made it so their consciousnesses could still speak in Chambre de Chasse, allowing her family to spend peaceful time together while sleeping and waiting to be cured. Hayley took their bodies in coffins out of New Orleans, awaiting the time when she could awaken them again. | | In In Using a series of tunnels that led to the dungeon Klaus was restrained in beneath the compound, Elijah was gravely concerned when he saw the state his brother was in. While Freya tried to break the magical barrier around Klaus, Elijah kept watch, eventually going up to the compound to try and hold off Marcel while they broke Klaus free. Elijah bravely confronted Marcel even knowing he was outmatched by Marcel's power. Marcel chastised Elijah for coming back to New Orleans even after he barely managed to survive his bite. Elijah told him he was there for Klaus, only infuriating Marcel further, prompting to viciously attack Elijah. While Elijah could hold his own, he was being overwhelmed by Marcel's assault until Hayley arrived to help him. Even together, the two were no match for Marcel, trying to convince him that enough bloodshed had been spilled and they just wanted Klaus back. Marcel remained steadfast in his refusal, preparing to kill them when a freed Klaus arrived, stabbing Marcel with Papa Tunde's blade. Elijah, Hayley, and Klaus took the opportunity to flee. Elijah helped Klaus get to the family's meeting point where Kol and Rebekah were waiting and they all embraced. However, Marcel caught up, threatening to kill them all but Klaus managed to convince him to let them live on the condition that they wouldn't return to New Orleans. Surprised Marcel agreed to the terms, Elijah and the others left New Orleans behind, travelling to Hayley's house. Klaus thanked his family again for not abandoning him to rot before they all proceeded to enter the house. In In Now aligned for the purpose of saving the children The Hollow had abducted, Vincent explained to Elijah that The Hollow could take control of peoples' minds to do its bidding but that he could use the ashes from one of its followers he had encountered to help track it. When Elijah brought up that The Hollow's history with Tracking Will into the woods, Elijah and Vincent met up with Klaus, Hayley, and a reluctant Marcel. They found The Hollow's servants in the middle of their ritual with the captive children, using the spell to claim more power for themselves. Elijah joined his family and allies in attacking the witches and trying to rescue the kids from the ritual. However, Klaus and Marcel were trapped by The Hollow and Elijah was unable to break through the barrier they were within. Vincent realized that The Hollow wanted them to come, needing an anchor to the living world. The only way they would be able to stop the spell and free Klaus and Marcel was to kill one of the children that was being used in the ritual. Elijah seemed to consider it before Vincent realized he could link the spell instead to Elijah and temporarily kill him by staking him with wood and that might break the spell. Elijah agreed to the plan and let Vincent link him to the spell before Hayley staked him in the heart with a tree branch. The plan worked, freeing Klaus and Marcel, and seemingly defeating The Hollow. Back a the compound, Hayley confronted Elijah about if he had really considered murdering a child if it meant saving his family. When it was clear he had, she told him they had to be better and had to stop putting their family first above everything else all the time. In While promising Hayley he wouldn't let anything happen to her like it did her parents, Elijah got a call from Freya telling him he needed to get back to the city or Marcel was going to kill Klaus. As the Hollow and its influence kept both Klaus and Marcel trapped in a house trying to kill one another, Freya tried to break in but only could with Elijah allowing her to channel him. When they broke through, Elijah interrupted Marcel and Klaus's fight but Marcel quickly overpowered him. Though Klaus almost listened to the Hollow's orders to kill Marcel, he freed Elijah by just snapping Marcel's neck. Together, Klaus, Freya, and Elijah all saw the Hollow manifest itself before disappearing. When Elijah questioned why Klaus spared Marcel even with a blade that could kill him, Klaus explained that killing Marcel would have given the Hollow what it wanted. They trapped Marcel in the same dungeon he had kept Klaus in for five years. Elijah visited him and explained why he killed Marcel five years ago, comparing it to Klaus sparing him now. He admitted that for a time, he believed Marcel was the key to Klaus's redemption but it's been made clear to him that Hope was actually the only one who really could help redeem him; making Marcel obsolete and no longer welcome in their family. Elijah swore that if Marcel continued to get in the way of his little brother's redemption, he would deliver on him another kind of nightmare. Elijah then left Marcel trapped in the dungeon. In That night, once the party had begun, Elijah addressed the attendants, telling them that the party was to celebrate an alliance between the Mikaelsons and Marcel; despite having Marcel captive. Klaus joined him in his speech, telling the crowd that they should put aside any past grievances since the Mikaelsons would only be staying in New Orleans briefly. With the festivities underway, Klaus spoke with Elijah about Vincent helping them expose any potential followers of the Hollow at the party. Once Vincent tracked down the witch Elijah requested a private audience with Dominic but Dominic brought two of his allies with him. Vincent joined them but when things between him and Dominic grew too hostile, Elijah snapped the necks of Dominic's allies before telling the enraged Vincent to leave them. Speaking with Dominic alone, the witch told Elijah about the sacrifices and that the children were just the start; the Hollow really needed the power of someone ancient, imbued with magic such as him or the other Original Vampires, settling for Marcel whose power would work just as well. Dominic demanded Elijah hand over Marcel and that he would also take Vincent just as a show of good faith. Elijah knew better than to betray Vincent as it would start a war with the covens. Dominic promised that if Elijah handed over Vincent and Marcel, the Mikaelsons would be spared. Dominic explained that the Hollow wanted to be made flesh again and would not be stopped in getting what it wanted. Elijah turned down Dominic's proposal and attacked him, holding him on the balcony in display of the whole party. He announced that the Originals would remove the Hollow and its disciples from New Orleans; tearing out Dominic's heart and publicly executing him. After the party, when Vincent spoke with Elijah about the show he put on, Elijah reminded him that an alliance between he and Vincent was essential in stopping the Hollow. He then spoke with Klaus, asking him if he had retrieved all of the weapons of the Hollow. Elijah told him about the Hollow's plans for rebirth and with Hayley's help, they learned that the Hollow was searching for its own remains. Elijah realized Dominic had taken Papa Tunde's blade, which turned out to be one of the Hollow's bones; understanding that if the Hollow's followers got to the rest of the bones before they did, they would raise the Hollow who would come for the Mikaelsons. In Vincent tried to perform the Harvest for Elijah but Elijah's makeshift and rushed set up of the ritual made it difficult. The Ancestors wouldn't accept the attempted offering, making Vincent and Elijah's eyes bleed before magically snapping Elijah's neck. When Elijah woke, he found Vincent using Davina's skull to connect to her spirit, hoping she'd accept the sacrifice and restore the link to the Ancestors. Elijah watched as their Harvest sacrifice was accepted and the new Harvest girls were revived. Vincent criticized Elijah for killing four innocent girls just to get the connection the Ancestors back. Elijah defended his actions, citing that they now had a new ally against the Hollow. Vincent coldly told him that he had no virtue and was a soulless infection to anyone around him, saddened that Hope had to be raised in a family he was part of. Elijah returned home and told Freya that Vincent had restored the link to the Ancestors, hoping that meant they could put the Hollow back in its cage. Freya wasn't as hopeful, having learned that the guardians of the Hollow's bones was a werewolf family and the last member of that family had died: In They found Alaric on the road, discovering that he had been attacked by the Hollow. When they realized the Hollow was possessing When Elijah learned Klaus was being held captive by the ancestral spirit of In After the Hollow left Elijah to be guarded by some of her followers, Elijah's guards were killed by Hayley and Freya. As they tried to free him from the barrier he was trapped within as well as bringing a cure for the thorn's poisons, their efforts were in vain as the Hollow's spirit arrived and began her spell, now that she had collected all of her bones. As she began to sacrifice the dying Elijah, Freya tried to pull his soul into her pendant like she had done with Finn's. Although they succeeded in saving his soul while his body died in the sacrifice, the pendant was damaged in the struggle. Elijah's soul was fractured but still preserved in the pendant, nearly impossible to make contact with. The result of his body and sireline dying allowed the Hollow to resurrect in her physical form. In In In In | | In In For weeks, Antoinette helped Elijah re-learn how to be a vampire. However, she was upset when Elijah brought her to a group feed with other vampires he had discovered, explaining that because she was a nightwalker who preferred not to wear a daylight ring and didn't enjoy violently feeding like others, she was a pariah among other vampire groups. They walked in Central Park and Antoinette explained her past, and that taking off the daylight ring allowed her to embrace that she had become an undead creature of the night, wanting to be reminded that she wasn't human and had died before. Elijah was suddenly ambushed by Marcel, who was in New York with Rebekah, and wanted to keep the siblings separated to keep the dark magic at bay. Marcel told Elijah to leave the city, even using his real name, and threatened to kill him and Antoinette if he didn't leave. Elijah recognized Marcel as the face in his memories. Elijah wanted to pursue Marcel so he could find out who he really was. Antoinette, recognizing the danger of Elijah's pursuit for answers, decided to leave him, not wanting to live her life that way. Elijah searched desperately for answers but was unsuccessful. In his confusion and anger, he slaughtered a night club full of vampires and people until Marcel returned. Elijah continued to demand answers but Marcel told him to stop trying to uncover his past, assuring Elijah that Elijah got rid of his own memories for someone, a little girl, and that if he kept digging up his past, she would get hurt. He left after telling Elijah to trust his own decision, and to make a life somewhere else. Elijah went to France and found Antoinette and the two spent the next seven years together, enjoying their life as musicians in a club. Elijah proposed to her but their night was interrupted by Klaus, having come to take Elijah back to New Orleans due to a family crisis. Klaus demanded Elijah return home with him, despite his lost memories, willingly or otherwise. Elijah refused and the two engaged in a fight, as the dark magic within them manifested due to their proximity to one another. Antoinette staked Klaus and she and Elijah tried to run. Klaus quickly recovered and cornered them, telling Elijah his family needed him. Elijah countered by revealing that he had learned who he was some time ago and hated everything he learned about his former life and who he had been. Without the personal memories, he still had knew all about the Mikaelson family, and wanted nothing to do with any of them. Elijah saw his old self as miserable, and refused to be that again. Klaus tried one last time to remind Elijah that they were kings that stood shoulder to shoulder throughout the ages, but Elijah proclaimed that Elijah Mikaelson was dead and snapped Klaus's neck. Later, Elijah realized that Antoinette had known that he was Elijah Mikaelson the whole time. She admitted that she knew he was an Original Vampire and that his family was legendary, and had enemies everywhere, not wanting to say anything so he wouldn't be in danger. She then questioned why he didn't tell her that he learned about his past. He told her Mikaelsons relished in bloodshed and didn't want her to know that part of him. She told him that their pasts and their families don't define them. Antoinette wanted to leave, worried that Klaus would pursue them but Elijah wasn't worried, knowing that when he renounced Klaus, he had broken his brother. Elijah removed his daylight ring, proclaiming his love and devotion to Antoinette, wanting to show her that he was all in on their new life and was completely leaving his old one behind. He knew he couldn't die from sunlight but wanted her to see just how serious he was. He boxed up his old belongings, including his ring, and put them at his feet. He opened the curtains and let the sun set him on fire, saying goodbye to Elijah Mikaelson and burning what was left of his past away. In In Elijah arrived at the location where Roman had taken Hope, and where, unknown to Elijah, Hayley was also being held captive. Klaus had gotten there first with In Held prisoner at an abandoned train depot, Elijah discovered Antoinette's bite and her worsening condition. He spoke with Klaus on the phone, demanding that he cure her, or that he would never forgive him. When Klaus brushed off Elijah's threats, Elijah offered him a deal, telling him that he would offer to be restored to the brother he knew if he spared Antoinette's life. Klaus bitterly rejected his offer, considering his brother dead after what happened with Hayley. Elijah promised Antoinette he wouldn't let her die but she worried that regaining his memories would take him away from her, since their seven years together couldn't compare to the thousand with his family. He called Marcel to come and restore his memories. Marcel and Vincent came and tried to undo his compulsion. However, Elijah was unable to open the red door in his mind that contained all of his past memories. To Marcel and Vincent's surprise, Elijah collapsed and didn't wake, like his mind had been taken elsewhere. Unknown to them, Elijah's consciousness had been pulled into a In Elijah searched with Kol, who tried to jog Elijah's memories with his old belongings during their search. Elijah asked Kol why he had never come to visit him in France when Klaus and Rebekah had. Kol explained that the two of them had never had much in common besides their looks, and went on to tell him that Elijah had helped murder his wife. Elijah tried to apologize, and questioned if he ever had. Kol told him that he had in his own particular way but luckily, Davina had come back, while most people weren't so lucky. Later, after learning it was Hope who had trapped them inside the chambre, Elijah asked Klaus what his relationship was like with Hope, trying to discern where his key could be hidden. Klaus told Elijah that he had given Hope her name. Marcel questioned Elijah on why his memories were still gone and Elijah countered that Marcel may have fried his brain with his tinkering or Vincent wasn't a very good witch. Marcel brought up their past together, the good and the bad, but Elijah remained ignorant to it all. Klaus confronted Elijah, accusing him of repressing his memories on purpose. He asked what Elijah remembered when Marcel tried to give him his memories back and he explained that he had tried to open a red door but had been unable to. His entire family questioned why he could so easily forsake them, memory or not, as well as forget about Hayley. Elijah wondered aloud if any of those past feelings had just been a product of being entangled in their vow of always and forever. Klaus argued that this new Elijah had killed his brother, the best friend that had been at his side for a thousand years. Their argument was interrupted as the portions of the dark magic kept within each of them were removed from them and taken back into Hope. While they all reeled from having the Hollow's magic removed, Marcel showed that he had found Elijah's key in a coffin in the basement, recognizing that Hope viewed Elijah as death now after what happened to Hayley. They unlocked the door with their respective keys and found themselves in Elijah's mental maze of doorways. While most left through their own doors, Elijah still couldn't open the red door. Klaus stayed behind to help his brother and the two broke through it together, unlocking Elijah's past and restoring his memories. Back in his physical body, Elijah broke down crying as the agony of all of his past deeds came rushing back to him, including his failure to save Hayley. Elijah broke down in front of his siblings. Later, Klaus gave Elijah the cure to save Antoinette, and though Elijah gave it to her, he apologized to her and left, now knowing who he really was. He dressed himself in his old far more sophisticated attire and went to the bayou, to mourn Hayley alone. In Hope arrived, in pain from the dark magic she had taken from them that now swelled inside her. It heightened her aggression and she lashed out at Elijah with fury. She used her magic to swipe at him, slashing him repeatedly. Elijah tried to explain that he didn't know who Hayley was when it happened but Hope didn't care, knowing that if Elijah hadn't intervened in Hayley's rescue, she would still be alive. Elijah told his niece that he hated himself now, just as much as she hated him. Klaus intervened, saving Elijah from further injury. Declan questioned what had happened and Elijah told him the truth about the monsters in the city before compelling him to forget everything that had happened, and to know that Hayley was at peace. In Elijah eventually managed to convince Klaus to trust him and asked Antoinette to gather the Nightwalkers. Elijah and Antoinette spoke to the gathered Nightwalkers at the church where they talked about Greta's beliefs of purity but then Elijah told them that they would share Greta's fate. Emmett and the Nightwalkers realized they had been betrayed, but Elijah reminded him that he never said he agreed with Greta's beliefs. Klaus and Hope entered and Hope unleashed her power and killed all of the Nightwalkers, wiping out their enemy while also settling her urges. With the Nightwalkers taken care of and Roman freed, Antoinette decided to leave New Orleans. When Elijah asked where she would go, she reminded him that he'd told her Shanghai was a nice place back when they first met in 1933. They departed, with both hoping they would meet each other again. In Prior to leaving, Freya had asked Elijah if he would give her away at her wedding to In Hope revealed that she knew she was dying and explained how she blamed herself for Hayley's death, even though she had tried to blame Elijah. She broke down, crying that she had broken the family and wanted her mom. The dark magic brewing in her made her collapsed and Elijah rushed her to Klaus. Later, after Hope had awoken, Elijah apologized that he always saw her as the savior of their family, now regretting putting that burden on her. Hope accepted it and told him that they were both born with responsibilities they didn't deserve. When Elijah happily told her that he saw so much of her mother in her, Hope told Elijah that she had seen Hayley's spirit and Hayley had told her that she was waiting for a dance Elijah had promised her. Though Hope thought it was her subconscious, Elijah knew it was true, since he had indeed promised her a dance. After learning that Klaus planned on taking on the dark magic in Hope and then killing himself to destroy it and save his daughter, Elijah tried to stop his brother. Elijah wanted Caroline's daughters to transfer it to him instead, and then wanted Klaus to kill him, seeing himself as a better option to save both Hope and Klaus. Elijah proclaimed that Hope needed Klaus but Klaus refuted this plan, not wanting to kill Elijah. The two fought and Klaus broke Elijah's neck and tossed him aside. Elijah woke up in a cell and heard the ritual taking place. He rushed outside to find that Klaus had taken in all of the Hollow's magic. He turned the last remaining white oak stake on himself, despite Elijah telling him not to. In Elijah had Freya temporarily channel some of the dark energy into him and out of Klaus so it could clear his mind. Klaus demanded the stake back but Elijah told him not yet, reminding him that he owed it to his family, and especially to Hope, to at least say goodbye. Klaus thanked Elijah for always trying to make him a better man but wanted to do it his way. While Klaus left, Elijah and the rest of the family gathered to celebrate Klaus's life. Klaus himself showed up, having had a change of heart. They all shared in old stories from throughout the millennia. The whole family wrote wishes for one another and then burned them and Klaus told them all how much he loved them, despite all of the misery he'd brought them throughout the centuries. He said goodbye and left them, to go die his way. Once Klaus was gone, Elijah told them that there was something else they needed to discuss, and told them that he was going to die with Klaus, having fulfilled his life's goal of redeeming his brother. Elijah went with Klaus and Rebekah to the bench he and Klaus had sat on when they discussed the future of the Mikaelsons after Hayley had become pregnant. Elijah watched as Klaus told Rebekah that he and Caroline had the cure for vampirism waiting for her in Mystic Falls and wanted her to live the life she'd always wanted. Rebekah thanked him and hugged him, before hugging Elijah, knowing this would be the last time she saw her brothers. Elijah remained, despite Klaus not wanting his last memory of him to be his death. He didn't want to say goodbye and Elijah agreed, pulling out the white oak stake and snapping it in half. Klaus scoffed, thinking it was a vain attempt to stop the white oak from working but Elijah told him he was aware that the stake would be just as effective. He sat down beside Klaus and told him that he planned to die by his side. Elijah explained that he'd always desired Klaus's redemption, ever since their lives were stolen by Esther and Mikael when they'd been turned into vampires and declared that he was taking their lives back. He went on, telling him that when the family were all celebrating, he saw a future for everyone there except for himself and had realized his sole purpose of his long life was to save Klaus from himself, and now believed he had achieved that. Klaus asked if Elijah really believed that he was redeemed and Elijah assured him that he did. Elijah told him that he had already told the rest of the family that he would follow Klaus into whatever adventure lied beyond. They talked about Hope and how she had the rest of the family looking after her, and acknowledged that she was the very best of Klaus. Elijah handed Klaus his half of the stake. Klaus asked what if there was only darkness in death and Elijah assured him that they would face it together then, as always. Klaus told Elijah that he was grateful to him for always loving him despite not always deserving it. Elijah tearfully told him that it had been a glorious ride, and had been his greatest honor. The two stood in front of one another, and prepared their stakes. They hesitated a moment before nodding to one another, preparing themselves for their deaths. They drove the white oak into each other's hearts at the same moment, and both began to desiccate before flames danced across their faces and they burned to ash, ending their long lives together. Personality [Edit](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Mikaelson?action=edit\u00a7ion=4)[ ] - \"In the beginning, our family was human, a thousand years ago, now. Although our mother dabbled in the dark arts, we were actually just a family trying to survive in a time when it was quite difficult to do so. And, for better or worse, we were happy.\" - \u2014Elijah to Hayley in [Always and Forever](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Always_and_Forever) [[241]](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vampirediaries/images/5/55/Vlcsnap-2011-10-29-16h32m18s51.png/revision/latest?cb=20120216164709)Elijah as a human. Elijah is a very attractive, positive, quirky and upbeat person. He always tries to see the good in people and tries to be a friend to everyone. He lives by a code of honor and morality that has been with him since he was a witch. As he told Elena in [All My Children](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/All_My_Children), he valued qualities such as compassion, honor and virtue long before his mother turned him into a vampire. Having learned to take care of his family over the years and being naturally responsible, Elijah had developed into a very free-spirited, mature and independent person. Elijah was close with his half-brother Klaus and his sister Rebekah, he was also a little close with his youngest brother Henrik and he was devastated after he was killed by werewolves. | | He is known for speaking his mind and having a fierce temper, which he possibly inherited from his father though unlike Mikael, Elijah is capable of controlling it. Elijah very rarely has tolerance for those who broke their words to him, shown when he killed Trevor for betraying him and imprisoned Katherine for her own betrayal. He also has no tolerance for those that disrespect him. He has been shown to go to great lengths to make those that disrespect him suffer, such as Damon, Thierry, and Marcel. When Marcel disobeyed and disrespected Elijah, he killed Marcel's best friend Thierry in front of him so Marcel would suffer that loss for eternity instead of killing Marcel. Elijah is very knowledgeable and deceptive in many ways. This encompasses knowledge of how to fight, wield a sword and defend himself. He exhibits an open-minded and optimistic personality. When he meets Elena, he respects her for her bravery and willingness to put herself in harm's way to protect her loved ones, which is something that Elijah himself has done for his family many times. Elijah in general is a very emotionally hardened character and has difficulty at times handling and accepting certain emotions. This is evident when after losing his family because of Klaus, he turns his sadness and pain into revenge against his half-brother. Elijah is also seen to be uncomfortable and has difficulty accepting romantic feelings, particularly towards Hayley. However, despite this, Elijah does believe in love but also believes that, at least for him, it is rare. He even mentioned that for the thousand years the he has lived, he has only been in love twice. While Elijah is capable of forgiveness, some acts such as betrayal is usually considered unforgivable by him, and even if the betrayer seeks atonement, Elijah has been known to mercilessly kill them. Elijah does have morals, but when ever a member of his family is in danger of being killed, he is forced to commit immoral acts, something he doesn't like to do in the first place, like Klaus, he has a sense of humor. Unlike Klaus, Elijah is caught off guard more easily, even more so when he attacks his opponent(s) in anger. Elijah is most characterized by his devotion to his cause of \"redeeming\" his half-brother; Klaus. As such, he has, with only one known exception, stayed by his half-brother's side, and will constantly search for the good in him, no matter the situation. However, he is not unaware of Klaus' spiteful, violent nature, and is familiar enough with it to predict his younger half-brother's movements. However, with the birth of Elijah purposefully seeks to uphold the image of the being he most aspires to be; a well kept, honorable, moral man who is devoted to his family. However, his vampiric nature, as well as insane devotion to Klaus has caused this being to become little more than a facade for him to hide behind. He is just as vicious, just as conniving, just as treacherous, just as dishonorable, and just as hypocritical as his siblings. This is most blatantly shown in his claims of familial loyalty, and then standing aside and permitting Klaus to dagger and abuse them, even helping in the instances of daggering Kol. Elijah is noted for his ability to control his more violent urges, and rarely ever so much allows his face to show its vampiric features. However, after In Unfortunately, his actions result in In In Without his memories and thus free from his burden of \"always and forever\", Elijah had a more laid back personality, being far less formal and pompous, as well as being more capable of being happy, as he is enjoying his new life with Antoinette after choosing to leave the past behind. Elijah also began to dress more casually, wearing leather jackets and t-shirts instead of expensive suits. Despite holding on to some of his morals, as he was disgusted by his act of killing to feed, he continues to drain his victims despite learning that he can compel them to forget. Elijah also slaughtered everyone in a nightclub when he was searching for answers. The amnesiac Elijah also has a strong dislike for the life he previous had as he tells Klaus that \"Elijah Mikaelson\" wasted his life trying to redeem Klaus and lacked any lasting happiness. Elijah effectively renounces his former life and familial ties, choosing to live with Antoinette and celebrates the occasion by removing his daylight ring and allowing himself to burn. Physical Appearance [Edit](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Mikaelson?action=edit\u00a7ion=5)[ ] - Main article: [Elijah Mikaelson/Appearance](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Mikaelson/Appearance) - Main article: [[245]](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vampirediaries/images/6/62/Elijah1x06.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131025183436)Elijah reading his journals from his past. Elijah is a handsome man who stands about 5'11\" in height, and has a thin but muscular body. He has short brown hair which appeared to have darkened slightly in the fourth season, with hazel brown eyes. His facial features are angular - high cheekbones, a strong jawline, and a straight nose. Despite being centuries old, he appears to be 23 or 24 years old. He is older than his half brother Niklaus, but is younger than his brother Finn and his sister Freya, making him the third oldest sibling of the family. Elijah is similar to his younger brother Kol in facial features, but resembles all of his siblings in a more general way. [[246]](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vampirediaries/images/f/f6/Elijah-vampire-diaries-hair-poll.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130303051911)Elijah Mikaelson's physical appearance over the years Elijah in the present day is consistently well-dressed. His wardrobe typically consists of a dress jacket, dress shoes, dress pants, shirt and sometimes a tie. This continues his trend of dressing well throughout the centuries. As a human, he wore more simplistic clothing, along with the other males in his family. But ever since he and his family journeyed to Europe, it seems he upgraded his attire to clothing indicative of a nobleman. Elijah has also worn different hairstyles in keeping with the times. It was revealed that Esther placed in his mind the idea of remaining clean and forgetting about his victims to save him from the guilt of it. Powers and Abilities [Edit](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Mikaelson?action=edit\u00a7ion=6)[ ] | | As the third oldest of his siblings, Elijah is the eldest His supernatural attributes aside, Elijah's greatest asset is his sharp intellect. His penchant for strategies and forming contingencies way ahead of time easily rivals Klaus', despite this, he has been outsmarted by Klaus on more than one occasion. Often, Elijah is able to discern a great deal of whatever or whoever presented to him after only a few keen observations. He was able to identify Elena masquerading as Katherine when they met at Pennsylvania after seeing her daylight ring and was also the first to discern that his former lover, Celeste, was in fact inhabiting the body of Sabine, and then later formulated a plan with Monique Deveraux to corner her the next time that Celeste jumps into another body. Because he is much more calm, composed, and strategic in battle than Klaus, Elijah is able to fight Klaus almost evenly shortly after being undaggered by Damon despite losing most of his strength from months without blood. His composure also enabled to him to single-handedly subdue Marcel's army without getting so much as a scratch on him, evidence by the lack of cuts on his clothes, something Klaus is unable to do, due to his lack of composure. Due to his long existence, Elijah has seen countless battles and is very experienced in battle. He is also very adaptable as seen in Diego's attempt to flank him, which apparently failed. It is presumed Diego also tried other tactics which also failed miserably against Elijah. Elijah's prowess in combat even allowed him to defeat ancient vampires like members of the Strix with relative ease, even when outnumbered. Elijah has slaughtered vampires and werewolves, alike, most often by ripping out their hearts, ensuring immediate death. Despite his prowess against Klaus and Marcel's army, he has been defeated by lesser vampires before, in fact only two, Stefan and Damon; however, they were using hit and run tactics against him, as well using a stake gun and vervain bombs, which ended in Damon outflanking him and staking him to a door. Also at the time, Elijah underestimated them and showed hubris, believing himself unbeatable. Elijah has not made this mistake since. Elijah also has an extremely high pain tolerance as he didn't even flinch when he used his own body as a makeshift lighter after taking off his daylight ring to kill Finn. Weaknesses [Edit](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Mikaelson?action=edit\u00a7ion=7)[ ] Elijah has the typical weaknesses of an [Original Vampire](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Original_Vampire). Following the destruction of the [White Oak Stake](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/White_Oak_Stake), it is presumed by all original vampires, that they cannot be killed, however, this seems to be untrue, following [the prophecy](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/The_Prophecy), as the Beast can kill him. Relationships [Edit](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Mikaelson?action=edit\u00a7ion=8)[ ] [Niklaus Mikaelson](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Niklaus_Mikaelson) [Edit](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Mikaelson?action=edit\u00a7ion=9)[ ] - \"We have fought together for centuries, and once again, to break your enemy, you broke your family.\" - \u2014Elijah to Klaus in [Ashes to Ashes](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Ashes_to_Ashes) - Main article: [Elijah and Klaus](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_and_Klaus) [[247]](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vampirediaries/images/b/bc/Ellijahklausep5.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131106011724)Klaus and Elijah Klaus is Elijah's maternal younger half-brother and his closest brother. When they were humans, they both had fun together by battles with swords, much to their father's disapproval. However their relationship became estranged when they both fell in love with the same woman [Tatia](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Tatia). After their mother died, Elijah and Klaus made a pact with Rebekah that they would stick together as one, always and forever. In the year 1114, they came across a vampire hunter named Alexander and the Brotherhood of the Five. Alexander and his brothers neutralized four original vampires, but were released (except Finn) by Klaus. In 1492, they met a woman named Katerina Petrova, the first doppelg\u00e4nger of Tatia. Klaus planned to sacrifice her, while Elijah started to have feelings for her. After Katerina's escape, the relationship between Elijah and Klaus was broken for a while. During 2010, Elijah was helping Elena Gilbert and the Salvatore brothers to kill Klaus, while Klaus was preparing to break his curse. After the curse was broken, Elijah met with his half-brother and was about to kill him when Klaus revealed their family was safe and only he knew where they were. Klaus daggered Elijah once they arrived at Alaric's apartment, but eventually Elijah was un-daggered by Damon Salvatore. Later, Elijah had undaggered all of their remaining siblings, but when they were about to leave Klaus for good, their mother appeared. Elijah tried to figure out his mother's motives and once he did, Elijah, Klaus and Kol confronted their mother and their brother, Finn. Elijah left Mystic Falls, while Klaus attempted to locate their lost brother Finn. Later, Elijah came back to bargain with Elena for Klaus' body. After Klaus \"died\", Elijah left again. Once Elijah had possession of the cure, he met with his half-brother again. He later handed his half-brother the [White Oak Stake](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/White_Oak_Stake), asking him to spare Katerina, but Klaus refused. Elijah has began to repair his relationship with his younger half-brother and believes he will find Klaus' redemption through his daughter Hope, Elijah's niece.Unfortunately, Elijah's relationship with Klaus takes a turn for the worst, though it was not a very healthy one to begin with due to actions made constantly by Klaus, when Elijah chose to believe Tyler's lies over Klaus, that he is (supposedly) aware that his child's blood can make hybrids, and he plans to use his child's blood once she is born to make an army of hybrids, to take over New Orleans. He falsely accused Klaus of only caring about his unborn child, so he can use her to sire more hybrids, unfortunately, he finds out the hard way that he was wrong, and unintentionally damages his relationship with Klaus. Though Elijah was well within reason to believe so. Elijah repairs his relationship with Klaus when he apologizes to him for accusing him of only caring about his unborn child so he can used her to sire more hybrids, despite the fact that their relationship is now repaired, Elijah is barely on speaking terms with Klaus. Unfortunately, their relationship becomes worse than ever, when Elijah daggered Klaus and allowed Hayley to try and take Hope away from him, in retaliation Klaus kills his girlfriend Gia, and daggered him with Papa Tunde's Blade, their relationship becomes estranged/broken after this, as they both want nothing to do with each other any more. They reconcile by the end of the third season.

His relationship with her has been very dysfunctional. Elijah is in the habit of being very critical towards Rebekah due to her actions. After she requests him to give her the cure for the vampirism, Elijah agrees, provided that she go a whole day without her vampire abilities. However, they were tricked by Silas with Klaus' help. After finding out that Klaus is going to be a father, Elijah asks her to follow Klaus and him to New Orleans. She refuses to follow Elijah and help him. Elijah is without a doubt the brother Rebekah respects most out of all her brothers. After 3 months of not hearing anything from Elijah she returns to New Orleans to find Elijah and make sure he's alright. Once she finds him, Elijah tells his sister to protect the wolf carrying Klaus' child, and once he gets home to the Mikaelson mansion he gets a warm welcome from Rebekah. But soon after she tells him that she is leaving town and would ask to come with her, she knows that Elijah would never leave town or Klaus.

Elijah and Katerina got to know each other before he introduced her to his younger brother Niklaus. Klaus wanted her to be sacrificed, but Elijah had started to have feelings for her. When Katerina escaped, Elijah felt betrayed by her and started hunting her down, but was mislead the other way thanks to a vampire named Trevor. 500 years later, Elijah finds her stuck inside the vampire tomb and compelled her to stay.

During the episode \"The Originals\", Katherine asks him to be with her, instead of heading to New Orleans for a life with Klaus. He doesn't say anything except goodbye, and leaves, after kissing her on the forehead. It is unclear whether their relationship will have a future. Even though he was a hallucination in [500 Years of Solitude](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/500_Years_of_Solitude), Katherine was happy to see him and had shown to have missed him. He presumably does not yet know that Katherine's dead.

Elijah respects human life. He is shown to be generally gentle, kind, caring and considerate with humans, the opposite of his half-brother Klaus, who is shown to have little to no regard for human life. He has not been seen compelling a human except Elena as he needed information from her and [Carol Lockwood](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_Lockwood) (for a change of suit). As a vampire, he strongly dislikes the idea of feeding on humans and instead feeds from blood bags. Elijah gives Elena an elixir that has a chance to resurrect the person who drinks it. The elixir was meant for Katerina before she escaped, but now he proffered it to Elena, so she could have had a chance to survive after the sacrifice. Esther, Elijah's mother, however, mentions that he is no better than the others, causing him to reflect that he kills, tortures and manipulates others to get what he wants, mainly to protect his family. Esther says this to Elijah and his two brothers Kol and Niklaus, \"For a thousand years, I've been forced to watch you. Felt the pain of every victim, suffered while you shed blood. Even you, Elijah, with your claim to nobility, you're no better. All of you. You're a curse on this earth. Stretched out over generations.\" When his brother was entombed, Elijah offered Elena a deal to hand Klaus back to him and, in exchange, no one will harm her. After the loss of his brother (Klaus), Elijah and Rebekah hugged for a few seconds.

Once Elijah comes to [New Orleans](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/New_Orleans), he goes to the bar at Rousseau's and talks with the bartender [Camille](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Camille_O%27Connell), about his brother and his family history. Four months later, after being revived by [Davina](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Davina_Claire), a powerful [witch](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Witch), he confesses to her that he has a terrible hunger inside after being in the coffin for 4 months, but would not feed from a child. The day after he comes home, he is seen reading a book while an innocent girl is bleeding out, a peace offering from Klaus. Elijah mentions that his forgiveness cannot be bought and says not \"this\" when he mentions the dead girl. After Elijah discovered that he was a vampire after losing his memories, he no longer respected human life. Elijah had no problem feeding off of random humans to keep himself fed and satisfied. After Elijah met his then-fianc\u00e9e Antoinette, he adopted her beliefs when it came to feeding off humans. Like Antoinette, Elijah now feeds and drains his victims of their blood.
