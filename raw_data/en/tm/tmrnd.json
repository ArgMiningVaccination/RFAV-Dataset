Action-orientated research and framework: insights from the French long-term social-ecological research network.Ecology and Society 24(3):10. https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-10989-240310 Synthesis Action-orientated research and framework: insights from the French long-term social-ecological research network Vincent Bretagnolle 1, Marc Benoit 2,3, Mathieu Bonnefond 4, Jon Many social-ecological system(SES)-based approaches have been proposed to address environmental problems. Mostsocial-ecological frameworks developed to date, however, lack clear operational linkages between humans and nature to efficient ly guide SESs toward resilience. A conceptual framework designed to be operational is therefore necessary, as well as a network of research platforms with which to apply it. We defined explicit coupling processes that can be used as leverages to pilot an SES toward sustainability. We proposed to formalize an SES as a dynamic entity composed of two coupling interfaces, i.e., adaptive management and ecosystemservices, both set within a landscape context to provide an actionable framework. These interfaces describe the way various actors, including scholars, benefit from and manage complex and changing interactions between the biophysical and social templates. Understanding the key processes underlying the interaction dynamics, especially those leveraging adaptive management processes,would help identify adaptive pathways for practices and collective actions, provide a crucial knowledge base for policy makers, and foster operationality as a requisite of an SES research agenda. Using several examples, we explained why long-term social-ecolo gical research platforms provide an ideal operational network of research infrastructures to conduct place-based action-orientated research targeting the sustainability of Anthropocene (Lewis and Maslin 2015), humankind's global footprint in terrestrial ecosystems gradually increased from 5% to more than 50% in just 3 centuries (Ellis et al. 2010). Already, human impacts on ecosystems worldwide have resulted in adramatic decline in biodiversity (Pimm et al. 2014), with measurable consequences for ecosystem services (ESs; Balvanera et al. 2014). Ecosystems will be even more intensively used in thefuture because the human population is still growing rapidly (Carpenter et al. 2009). Altogether, increased human pressure on ecosystems, global change, finite resources, and economicinstability urge decision makers to frame new paradigms for sustainable development to achieve human well-being for all (Ellis 2015). Locally relevant indicators of the system's state weredeveloped to prompt public action (e.g., Dearing et al. 2014), but the analysis of the relationship between social and biophysical conditions at broader scales, e.g., the landscape scale, as a tool tofoster changes in management from a system dynamics perspective is still lacking. Environmental problems result from social, technical, economic, and ecological variables that not only form complex systems on their own, but also can interact to create wicked problems withintricate causes and consequences. Solving them calls for a new research posture, shifting from monodisciplinary approaches to transdisciplinarity (Jahn et al. 2012). The latter allows accountingfor various and diverging viewpoints and involves explicit stakeholder knowledge, as well as cooperation between science and society (Spangenberg et al. 2015, Church 2018).Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research that links social and ecological systems as an integrated science-policy research agenda (Folke 2006, Ostrom 2009) also requires a dedicatedresearch infrastructure (RI). We argue that long-term social- ecological research (LTSER) platforms are such RI, sharing France, 13Nelson Mandela University, Sustainability Research Unit, George Campus, George, South 14LTSER Society 24(3): 10 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss3/art10/ Table 1.

We propose pathways to develop such a framework, which makes explicit the coupling interfaces between social and ecological templates to use leverage tools and promote action for active social-ecological system (SES) stewardship (Chapin et al. 2010). We analyze the case of theFrench LTSER RI, currently composed of 14 highly diverse research platforms (Table 1), and further argue that the RI should be organized as a network. At the local level, i.e., sites or platforms,social-ecological feedbacks can be monitored, experimented with, and predicted, whereas at the network level they can be formalized and generalized.KEY DRIVERS OF THE SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM INTERFACE: CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK Most natural ecosystems have been colonized and exploited by humans, becoming SESs. SESs combine interdependent social and ecological dynamics that involve multiple interactions andfeedbacks between the human and ecological components (Collins et al. 2011), are adaptive (Folke et al. 2005, Levin et al. 2013), and loop into co-occurring complex (Holling 2001) andcross-scale (Levin 1998, Cash et al. 2006) dynamics. Addressing solely the social dimension of resource management without ecosystem dynamics or focusing only on the biophysical processesas a basis for decision making for sustainability both lead to narrow conclusions that may result in unexpected outcomes and 32Ecology and Society 24(3): 10 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss3/art10/ Fig. 1. The conceptual framework of the social ecological system (SES) within the French long-term social- ecological research platforms. The SES as an entity is composed of two coupling interfaces, the adaptive management interface and the ecosystem services interface, both set within an explicit landscape context. The originality in this framework is the emphasis on explicit components that will directly contribute to changing the trajectory of the SES. even the collapse of SESs, e.g., the Aral Sea. The system thereforeneeds to be considered as a whole because of the tight couplings among components and across scales (Redman et al. 2004). Going beyond Collins et al.'s (2011) conceptual framework, we suggest that SES key elements can be coupled into two process- based interacting interfaces, each comprising three core items: the(1) \"ecosystem services interface\" with functions, goods, and benefits/values; and the (2) \"adaptive management interface\" with collective action and colearning, multiple resource uses, andpractices. Both interfaces are set within a given landscape (Fig. 1). We consider these six core items as leverages influencing the dynamics of the SES, though they differ in scale and nature. Thetwo interfaces and their core coupling elements share characteristics despite having their own variables, methods, analytic tools, vocabulary, and semantics (Abson et al. 2014,Rissman and Gillon 2017). Having many meanings, their useconveys concepts with dialectically vague frontiers. As such, theycan be seen as boundary objects that can promote opportunities for transdisciplinarity (Schr\u00f6ter et al. 2014). The ES interface and its elements have already been clearly identified and discussed as coupling agents in social-ecological processes (e.g., Reyers et al. 2013, Hamann et al. 2015).Conversely, the core elements of the adaptive management interface were less often considered as coupling forces in the SES, except in Ostrom's SES framework (Ostrom 2009) and, morerecently, for collective action (Barnaud et al. 2018) or practices (Lescourret et al. 2015). Links between collective action and multiple resource use were also recognized to contribute tofostering adaptive governance in a context of adaptive management or comanagement (Kofinas 2009). We therefore need to specify these core elements of the adaptive managementinterface and their interplay in the context of our framework. 33Ecology and Society 24(3): 10 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss3/art10/ Subsequently, we provide an overview of the framework, mainly based on theoretical considerations and literature review. Then, in Operationalizing the conceptual framework within research infrastructures, we provide examples from the French LSTER network. The adaptive management interface This interface, in which institutional arrangements and ecological knowledge interplay at various levels, is central to SES dynamicsand their study (Folke et al. 2005). The transitions from the three core elements of this interface, i.e., collective action, multiple resource use, and practices, can be considered fuzzy (Fig. 1).Indeed, collective action can be seen as the social dimension of managing multiple uses of SESs (e.g., see Kofinas 2009), whereas individual or collective practices stem from these arrangementsbut are filtered through value systems and mental models. This interface thus describes a form of adaptive management of the focal SES, or even comanagement in more advanced couplinginitiatives (Olsson et al. 2004). In some of the SES literature, this interface is also referred to as adaptive governance (Folke et al. 2005, Chaffin et al. 2014), which describes the links betweensocieties and ecosystems not only as end products but also as at the very heart of social-ecological coupling. Adaptive governance focuses on experimentation and learning, bringing togetherresearch on institutions and organizations for collaboration, collective action, and conflict resolution in relation to natural resource and ecosystem management (Kofinas 2009). In manyways, adaptive governance can be considered an ideal model for SES governance (Chaffin et al. 2014). Collective action The concept of collective action (Olson 1971, Ostrom 1990) isused to describe the processes through which \"two or more individuals cooperate to accomplish a goal they cannot achieve individually\" (Matson et al. 2016:85). Within the SES framework,collective action and social relations are framed with regard to the biophysical, particularly facing environmental uncertainty, and the socio-economic contexts, in particular, public policies andmarket economy. It implies decision making or deliberation (Rosenberg 2007), which can be blocked or distorted by power relations, existing incentives, and limited knowledge.Implementation and evaluation processes around the policies are intended to achieve the goal of collective action, such as resilience (Maz\u00e9 et al. 2017). In such a process, different communities ofscientific experts, knowledge holders, and decision makers interact through different kinds of boundary objects (Brand and Jax 2007, Clark et al. 2016). Multiple resource use Natural resources, including land and, by extension, ESs, are usedin multiple ways and, in most cases, by multiple agents. Agents can act individually or collectively and belong to different user groups (as defined by Ostrom et al. 2007). This situation ofmultiple use by multiple agents requires complex processes of negotiation and regulation providing rules at different levels, particularly property rights, self-organization rules, and policy outputs, among different agents for the implementation of decision making (Lascoumes and Le Gales 2007). We hold theview that the study of multiple uses can be employed not only as an analytical tool but also as a way to contribute to the management of the multiple uses of multiple natural resources.The latter can, directly or indirectly, e.g., through a common driver, interact with each other, echoing in a way the idea of a bundle of ESs that need to be considered simultaneously ratherthan separately (Bennett et al. 2009). We also draw attention to collective uses stemming from negotiation and local arrangements by including them in the framework, because practical collectivemanagement has received proportionally less emphasis in adaptive management theories (but see Berthet et al. 2012). Practices Practices are defined as actions and measures motivated by background knowledge, cultural and technical heritage,perception, beliefs, and states of emotion (Feldman and Orlikowksi 2011). They are the primary interactions between human beings and their supporting ecosystem and happen fromfine (field, neighborhood) to coarse (regions, cities) scales. Practices are effect-producing phenomena within the SES affecting the SES coupling (Lescourret et al. 2015). They directlyaffect a complex set of biophysical, ecological, and social features required to deliver ESs, hence impacting the resilience and sustainability of ES provision (Bennett et al. 2009). For example,in agricultural landscapes, the delivery of multiple ESs (agricultural production, pollination, and landscape aesthetics) derives from agricultural practices, such as crop species sown, theuse of inputs or ploughing, and the size of fields (Tancoigne et al. 2014). In semiarid savannahs of the LTSER Hwange, animal distribution (directly related to water use), trampling, and safariexperience are all conditioned by pumping practices in protected areas (Chamaill\u00e9-Jammes et al. 2007). INTEGRATING SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL CONCEPTS WITHIN LONG-TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH SITESDespite a few operational tools and practical guidelines that exist (Anderies et al. 2004, United Nations Development Programme 2015), SES research has remained mostly theoretical, generic, andqualitative (Nassl and L\u00f6ffler 2015). The theory-to-practice gap to implement sustainable transformation is further blurred by the fact that most often, social and ecological components are nottreated equally profoundly and reciprocally (Binder et al. 2013), and most of the time, the research process is considered disconnected from the system's trajectory. Although the societalcomponent of SESs has been hardly surveyed in these areas in the long term, the ecological component has often been monitored for decades with dedicated research platforms, particularly withinthe long-term ecological research (LTER) network. LTER is an initiative that arose in several countries more or less simultaneously, but which really took the format of an organizednetwork first in the United States in the 1980s (Callahan 1984). LTER sites now number almost 1000 worldwide (Mirtl et al. 2013). They were primarily chosen in natural landscapes without human activities. They were small in size and focused on monitoring physical, chemical, and biological processes.However, human and social aspects eventually gained interest, with more and more sites involving human activities (see the review by Folke et al. 2005). A very similar convergence appearedin Europe, even though the European LTER network officially started later and in a different form (Haberl et al. 2006, Mirtl et al. 2013). LTSER is a combination of SES research and LTERapproaches. It emerged more or less simultaneously on the two continents (Mauz et al. 2012). 34Ecology and Society 24(3): 10 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss3/art10/ Fig. 2. Current research investment of the 14 research platforms of the French long-term social-ecological research network for each core coupling element of the two interfaces. Several research approaches are used: formalism, observation, experimentation, and modeling. The colors indicate the levels of investment (green = high, yellow = medium, and orange = low) of each platform, i.e., 14 color rectangles per table cell. The resulting color mosaic per cell gives an overview of the current research strength and needs of the network. Goods andecosystem services are split into mono- or multiecosystem services. Monetary and nonmonetary valuations of benefits are considered. The emergence of social-ecological perspectives within the LTERinitiative emerged from the integration of land-use perspectives, the inclusion of new disciplines, particularly from the socialsciences and humanities, and the development of interdisciplinary research (Collins et al. 2011). The propulsion of SES theoretical background within the LTER network led to at least five majorchanges: (1) anthropogenic drivers, initially perceived as \"disturbances\" that should be minimized in LTER, became of special interest in LTSER with their own dynamics and feedbackloops (Mirtl et al. 2013); (2) the complexity of the systems under study increased dramatically, as ecosystems and SESs are both complex adaptive systems (Folke et al. 2005, Levin et al. 2013);(3) conceptual frameworks included explicit interactions between the social and ecological/biophysical elements leading to new research questions, e.g., citizen viewpoints (Mirtl et al. 2013); (4) scientists eventually shifted from being perceived as objective, detached experts delivering knowledge in LTER sites to beingstakeholders among the many that learn about and contribute to managing complex adaptive systems, because they are often involved in the decision-making process in the LTSER platformsand sites (Waltner-Toews et al. 2003); and (5) in LTSER, policies became hypotheses, and management actions represented ongoing learning experiments to test these hypotheses (Ostrom2009). However, we believe that moving from LTER to LTSER has not been fully achieved: current SES frameworks are not explicit enough to tackle present challenges. We need further tools todevelop policies enhancing the sustainability and resilience ofSESs. Beyond theoretical frameworks that are already available (Folke et al. 2005, Daily et al. 2009), we need operationalframeworks that provide an adequate overview of the problems, associated causes, and resulting effects, thus helping to \"organize diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiry\" as suggested byMcGinnis and Ostrom (2014). In SES frameworks, the widely used notion of \"driver\" is challenged: land-use change is traditionally seen as a \"human\" driver, whereas it can result fromsocial-ecological processes (Lambin et al. 2001); the resulting landscape should be considered as the holistic context and provides indicators of social-ecological interactions (Wu andDavid 2002, Beno\u00eet et al. 2012). Similarly, even though ESs are commonly present within most SES frameworks, the links between SESs and ESs are seldom explicit (Binder et al. 2013, F\u00f6rster et al. 2015), and so are the human dimensions of ESs (Spangenberg et al. 2015). OPERATIONALIZING THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN RESEARCHINFRASTRUCTURES To develop our LTSER approach in the French network, we initially used Collins's framework (Collins et al. 2011) as a basis,distinguishing between the social and biophysical templates. However, given the prominence of the biophysical template in many sites of our network, we focused our efforts on the socialtemplate (Fig. 2). For instance, values are often neglected in the 35Ecology and Society 24(3): 10 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss3/art10/ 36Ecology and Society 24(3): 10 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss3/art10/ SES literature (Jones et al. 2016), particularly relational values that bind humans with ecosystems beyond the intrinsic and instrumental values of ecosystems. Values are also a fundamentalaspect of cognition, so mental models should provide key insights into the social dimension of coupled SESs (Lynam and Brown 2011). In fact, sense of place (Chapin et al. 2012) and placeattachment (Gosling and Williams 2010) are shown to be critical in explaining conservation-minded behavior and ecosystem stewardship. In the Hwange LTSER, we found that people rootedin the area had fewer conflicting views on wildlife and conservation than those who moved to the area in search of directbenefits from the protected areas or the natural resources (Guerbois et al. 2013). The explicit position of knowledge, values, and worldviews in our framework aims at underlining their crucialrole in designing action-oriented research and thus addressing sustainability and conservation issues (Teng\u00f6 et al. 2017). It is also a reminder that some knowledge and value systems (mostly indigenous) may have intrinsic elements and principles ofenvironmental stewardship, emphasizing the need for some hybridization to foster innovation (Clark et al. 2016). Local rules for natural resource harvesting can thus be derived fromnegotiation between traditional authorities, economic actors, scholars, and local government services and result in new practices that can be inspired by traditional practices, as in the case of theSikumi Forest in the Hwange LTSER (Guerbois et al. 2012, Guerbois and Fritz 2017). A second major way to operationalize the framework is to apply it to landscapes that act both as contexts and outcomes (Fig. 1). This means using RIs that operate at the landscape level. Indeed,landscapes both condition and result from social and ecological interactions (Lambin et al. 2001). Moreover, through feedbacks, they contextualize and support SES dynamics. Landscapes areoften seen as a societal outcome of land-use decisions (Ostrom et al. 2007). They may also be viewed as cultural (Haberl et al. 2006), as well as social-ecological products, emerging fromcoevolutionary interactions between people and ecosystems in ways that maintain biodiversity and provide humans with goods and services necessary for their well-being (Gu and Subramanian2014). In the Rh\u00f4ne River LTSER, thanks to strong interactions among multiple stakeholders over decades, models were run to predict the ecological impacts of a unique river restorationprogram while taking into account social values and public expectations in several riverine landscapes. In return, restoration measures benefited the ecology of the river, improved genericecological knowledge, deeply renewed social links with the river, and influenced future management plans and practices (Lamouroux et al. 2015). In our framework, we considerlandscapes not only as evolving social-ecological contexts but also as the nucleus of social-ecological dynamics across scales (see Fig. 3 for an example). We thus use all dimensions of landscapes, i.e., material, resource based, immaterial, cultural, functional, and scenic, to support place-based research. Landscapes are spatiallynested hierarchies and can be effectively studied as such (Wu and David 2002). Including landscape in our conceptual framework allows it to become a flexible and integrative object for actors atall scales. In SESs, as in most complex systems, scale is a critical issue, including both temporal and spatial scales, as well as both patterns and processes (Redman et al. 2004). These scale issuesoccur in both social and ecological components, but they arecritically contingent to adaptive management because cross-scale interaction mismatches may lead to SES vulnerability (Redman et al. 2004, Cumming et al. 2013). Therefore, scale should be aprimary focus of any study on SES adaptive management or transformation. We suggest in our framework that the use of a landscape lens should (1) help reduce the likelihood of scalemismatches and (2) allow us to explicitly address causes and consequences of landscape changes, which is crucial to render research useful for sustainability science. For instance, whenaddressing farmer/elephant (Loxodonta africana) coexistence in LTSER Hwange, the emphasis should not just focus on field damage or on mitigation strategies at the ward or district levels, but also integrate dynamics across scales, i.e., the household, farmland, and village scales (Guerbois et al. 2012). Other aspectsof the human-elephant relationship, such as its significance for the community, the true cost of damage for livelihoods, local perceptions of elephants, and the value of elephants for the human community of interest, should also be taken into account(Guerbois et al. 2012). A shift toward sustainability will thus require considering not only the ecological landscapes but also social and political landscapes where the issues are raised (Fig.3). This calls for rethinking the role of research and of an RI rooted in SESs where social-ecological processes are simultaneously studied. Such an RI must be deeply connectedwith institutions, must engage in public/collective actions with stakeholders and citizens, and should, in addition, be running for decades to identify the long-term dynamics of ecological andsocial processes, to address the conditions of well-being for all, across generations. The third specificity of our framework that makes it operational is that the French LTSER platforms endorse an operational definition of ESs. We acknowledge that ESs are not simply a by-product of ecosystems, but rather the result of a coproduction process, in which human societies attribute values and use human capital and technology to modify ecosystem processes and goods(see Collof et al. 2017), even unintentionally (Harrington et al. 2010, Mace et al. 2015). The second interface of our conceptual framework depicted in Figure 1 is the ES interface. The ES cascadeformally links the two templates (Fig. 1) and makes the interdependencies between humans and natural systems explicit (Collins et al. 2011). Even if the ES concept has been widelycriticized (Schr\u00f6ter et al. 2014), ESs were found by Binder et al. (2013) to be an explicit part of all SES frameworks. ESs are often seen as the central part of a cascade, with ecosystem properties(biophysical structure, natural capital, or stock) producing ecosystem functions (flows), which provide goods and services that impact human livelihoods (benefits or costs), in a specificvalue system (Haines-Y oung and Potschin 2010, Mace et al. 2015). ESs are also a normative way to identify enhanced social- ecological interactions (Abson et al. 2014). However, despite the fact that the ES concept is widely used, it sometimes fails to deliver relevant knowledge for policy making, developing financialmechanisms, and operational decisions (Laurans et al. 2013). In addition, decision makers, governments, businesses, and the public are rarely taken into consideration when analyzing ESs(Daily et al. 2000, 2009). We argue that LTSER sites provide a perfect tool not only to operationalize the ES concept and use in policy making (Colloff et al. 2017), but also to share focus,terminology, and system representations among research fields 37Ecology and Society 24(3): 10 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss3/art10/ and disciplines and with the various stakeholders present within the boundaries of a given LTSER site or platform (Collins et al. 2011). Detailed analyses of the ES cascade were carried out, forinstance, in the LTSER Plaine & Val de S\u00e8vre (Bretagnolle et al. 2018), linking land use and pollinator abundance and distribution (Bretagnolle and Gaba 2015), the role of wild and domestic beesin crop pollination (Perrot et al. 2018), crop yield (Perrot et al. 2019), farmers' income (Catarino, Bretagnolle, Perrot, et al., unpublished manuscript), and pollinator socio-cultural value(Montoya et al. 2019). We also need a better understanding oflinkages within bundles of ESs and particularly of how they areaffected by policy (land-use policies especially) and decision-making processes of individual stakeholders. This approach wasused successfully in several French LTSER sites and platforms tobring together various stakeholders and elaborate collectivelyinnovative landscapes, focusing on bundles of ESs (Berthet et al. 2019). Viewing ESs through the SES lens imposes considering ESs as a tool for assessing a mission-oriented discipline (Cowling etal. 2008) with a policy aim in mind, whether it is produced on request from decision makers or not. We therefore plead for an explicit SES-based approach of ESs, embedding a systemic viewof social, economic, and ecological processes taking place in LTSER sites. The interfaces should be dealt with jointly as coupling agents in social-ecological processes. They should thusbe fully investigated in any LTSER program portfolio (Barnaud et al. 2018). NETWORKING LONG-TERM SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH SITES AND PLATFORMS TO DELIVERSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES Overall, almost 5 years was necessary to structure the French LTSER network around the SES interface, formalize theframework, and assemble the various items and concepts. The framework is currently being applied successfully in all French LTSERs (see Fig. 3 for a detailed working example, andBretagnolle et al. [2018] for another example). The framework allows us to explore various questions within the SES (Fig. 2) and to describe the boundaries of the SES being studied (Kansky etal. 2016). Our experience in structuring the network highlights three key features: First, adopting a common operational transdisciplinary conceptual framework is a powerful tool toaddress a portfolio of actions toward sustainability. Second, the RI offers a diversity of contrasting and complementary ecological and social situations over a wide range of SESs (Table 1, Fig. 2); the RI is thus organized as a network distributed along ecological (e.g., climate and ecosystem types) and socio-economic (e.g.,livelihoods and urbanization) gradients (Table 1) that promote the emergence of comparisons and experimental approaches at every level of the SES, addressing research questions related tothe key elements of the adaptive management interface (Fig. 2). Third, the use of the SES approach in the LTSER network implies the recognition of researchers among the stakeholders of the SESthey study, thus contributing to, and sometimes initiating, social- ecological experiments. The level of involvement of scientists as stakeholders also follows a gradient: In some cases, scientists maybe a simple observer group, whereas in others they are active actors in action-oriented research sites, e.g., activists or simply participating in management committees. In a few cases, they may even become landscape managers, e.g., within the NATURA 2000 network or in LTSER Plaine & Val de S\u00e8vre (Berthet et al. 2012). LTSER sites are therefore dynamic tools that can be adapted to new challenges and in which scientists, as stakeholders involved in collective action, must bear a clear definition of their exactroles, accepting that research is not neutral (Falck and Spangenberg 2014). For instance, we recently developed the concept of SES experiments (Gaba and Bretagnolle, unpublishedmanuscript) as a new tool for place-based research in which scientists perform experimental manipulation of some of the components of the SES. Such experiments were performed withfarmers in LTSER Plaine & Val de S\u00e8vre (Gaba et al. 2018). Experimental approaches in policy interventions are stronglyneeded to design for performance evaluation and improvement of the SES over time (Daily et al. 2009). Recognizing scientists as stakeholders may ensure long-term persistence of SES researchwithin LTSER sites. This, as in any long-term RI, is only guaranteed as long as researchers are committed and funding is sufficient. Therefore, to move from concept to sustainable development policies of SESs, the example of the French LTSER network stresses that scientists and stakeholders need (1) to better definethe key drivers, i.e., the processes underlying the interaction dynamics, at the interface between ecosystem and society, especially those acting at the landscape scale; and (2) to identifythe adaptive management processes and pathways, in terms of practices and collective actions, to provide operational knowledge for policy makers.

A typology and framework for analysis was developed that classi es local climate plans in terms of their alignment with spatial (local, national and international) and other climate related policies. Out of eight types of local climate plans identi ed in total we document three types of stand-alone local climate plans classi ed as type A1 (autonomously produced plans), A2 (plans produced to comply with national regulations) or A3 (plans developed for international climate net-works). There is wide variation among countries in the prevalence of local climate plans, with generally more plans developed by central and northern European cities. Approximately 66% of EU cities have a type A1, A2, or A3 mitigation plan, 26% an adaptation plan, and 17% a joint adaptation and mitigationplan, while about 33% lack any form of stand-alone local climate plan (i.e. what we classify as A1, A2, A3plans). Mitigation plans are more numerous than adaptation plans, but planning for mitigation does not always precede planning for adaptation. Our analysis reveals that city size, national legislation, and in- ternational networks can in fluence the development of local climate plans. We found that size does matter as about 80% of the cities with above 500,000 inhabitants have a comprehensive and stand-alone mitigation and/or an adaptation plan (A1). Cities in four countries with national climate legislation (A2), i.e. Denmark, France, Slovakia and the United Kingdom, are nearly twice as likely to produce localmitigation plans, and ve times more likely to produce local adaptation plans, compared to cities in countries without such legislation. A1 and A2 mitigation plans are particularly numerous in Denmark,Poland, Germany, and Finland; while A1 and A2 adaptation plans are prevalent in Denmark, Finland, UKand France. The integration of adaptation and mitigation is country-speci c and can mainly be observed in two countries where local climate plans are compulsory, i.e. France and the UK. Finally, local climate plans produced for international climate networks (A3) are mostly found in the many countries where autonomous (type A1) plans are less common. This is the most comprehensive analysis of local climateplanning to date. The ndings are of international importance as they will inform and support decision- making towards climate planning and policy development at national, EU and global level being based onthe most comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge of local climate planning available to date. \u00a92018 The Authors.

Introduction Tackling climate change is a priority for the European Union (EU), which has set ambitious short and long-term emissions reduction targets, i.e. to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions by 20% by 2020, 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2080 compared to 1990 levels ( European Commission, 2011 ). Meeting these targets will increase the likelihood that the aims of the Paris Agreement underthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 2015 ) can be met. The central aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep global temperature rise this century well below 2 /C14C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the tem- perature increase even further, to 1.5/C14C. Furthermore, the agree- ment aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. Cities1are crucial actors in climate change mitigation andadaptation efforts ( Kousky and Schneider, 2003 ;Rosenzweig et al., 2010 ). This is particularly the case in Europe, where approximately 74%2of the population lives in urban areas. However, how and why cities engage in climate policy is a matter of current debate (Cast /C19an Broto, 2017 ;De Gregorio Hurtado et al., 2014 ,2015 ;Heidrich et al., 2016 ;Olazabal et al., 2014 ;Reckien et al., 2015 ) and the effect of (binding and non-binding) national or international policies on thelocal level is not well understood ( Kelemen, 2010 ). Engagement of European cities in climate mitigation and adaptation efforts has been partially assessed ( Flacke and Reckien, 2014 ;Reckien et al., 2014a ). However, the risk of climate-related impacts combined with vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems requires a response to climate change, in terms of both mitigation (to address the causes of climate change) and adaptation (to deal with the consequences of a changed climate), across all European cities. Cities can play a key role in developing and implementing climate change programs because they are located at the interface of local action and national and international level climate change adaptation and mitigation commitments (Heidrich et al., 2016 ). Moreover the synergies and trade-offs that exist between mitiga-tion and adaptation ( Landauer et al., 2015 ) are especially felt by cities ( IPCC, 2015 ).Cast /C19an Broto (2017) argues that cities play a pivotal role in transnational climate change governance in three ways: rstly, cities support processes of learning and exchange between local governments and other sub-national organizations.Secondly, they gather local resources and knowledge in order to implement speci c schemes. Thirdly, by raising the pro le of cities in international agendas they evoke the interest of political andbusiness actors. In order to excel in this pivotal role, cities need to design and implement local climate plans (LCPs). In this study, LCPs are considered as planning documents prepared at the city levelAbbreviations CO2 Carbon Dioxide EC European Commission EU European Union GDP Gross Domestic Product GHG Greenhouse gases LCP Local Climate Plan SECAP Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan UA Urban Audit UK United Kingdom UN United Nations 1referring to all local authorities with urban characteristics, i.e. urban areas, towns, and cities.2http://www.statista.com/statistics/270860/urbanization-by-continent /(last accessed 19 December 2017).D. Reckien et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 191 (2018) 207 e219 208 56that contain policies that are relevant to climate change adaptation and/or mitigation (see also the methods section below and Supplementary Information ). The climate governance at the national level in each Member State in fluences the development and implementation of climate plans at the lower administrative levels, including LCPs ( Heidrich et al., 2016 ;De Gregorio Hurtado et al., 2015 ). However, in coun- tries where national climate policies are lacking or weak cities alignthemselves to international climate networks ( Heidrich et al., 2016 ; Reckien et al., 2014b ;Villarroel Walker et al., 2017 ). The largest climate networks in Europe are the EU Covenant of Mayors and the UN Compact of Mayors, although other international, national orsub-national/regional networks have also been formed to support the diffusion of international best practices and to help cities share climate change planning related knowledge. Bauer and Steurer (2014) argue that regional climate change networks help prepare policy systems for innovation by spreading information on the magnitude and timing of climate impacts and identifying potential response options. However, the in fluence of networks, relative to that of local and national governance, is only beginning to be explored ( De Gregorio Hurtado et al., 2015 ;Reckien et al., 2015 ). Another in fluential factor is proximity to a country that is actively addressing climate change. Neighbouring such a country seems to spur on to tighten one's own mitigation policies ( Biesenbender and Tosun, 2014 ;Tompkins and Amundsen, 2008 ). Moreover, European LCPs have been positively associated with the size of a city, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and withadaptive capacity, i.e. with institutional capability and economic strength ( Reckien et al., 2015 ). By contrast, cities with high unem- ployment rates, but also warmer summers, close proximity to thecoast, and hence increased projected exposure to future climate impacts have signi cantly fewer LCPs ( Reckien et al., 2015 ). Lack of resources, inadequate capacity in terms of preparedness, and lowlevels of competence and political salience rank as the principal barriers to local climate planning across EU countries, especially in lower income EU countries ( Massey et al., 2014 ). Lack of political commitment, associated with inertia towards the integration of climate action in local policies, is a further barrier in many cities that needs to be addressed by speci c research. Climate change planning in European cities is therefore often determined by local institutional capacity rather than by a proactive response to anticipated future needs ( Reckien et al., 2015 ). European national and local government climate change pol- icies have prioritised mitigation over adaptation ( Reckien et al., 2014a ). This preference might be motivated by other bene ts of mitigation ( Puppim de Oliveira et al., 2013 ), such as economic savings and improved energy security, in addition to reduced emissions ( Bulkeley and Kern, 2006 ;Heidrich and Tiwary, 2013 ; Hunt and Watkiss, 2011 ;Kousky and Schneider, 2003 ;Villarroel W alker et al., 2017 ;Wende et al., 2012 ). Similarly, adaptation in cities is seldom carried out systematically with measures acrossseveral sectors ( Wamsler et al., 2013 ). Adaptation implementation often depends on alignment with other programmes (e.g. health) that are designed to address non-climate related problems as well. In this study we use the term 'city 'to refer broadly to all local authorities with urban characteristics, i.e. urban areas, towns, and cities. Speci cally, the study analyses the LCPs of 885 Urban Audit (UA) cities across the EU-28 countries. Data on UA cities is available in the Eurostat repository, based on information collected and provided by the National Statistical Institutes, the Directorate- General for Regional and Urban Policy and Eurostat. We rst develop a typology of LCPs in Europe. We then identify and review existing LCPs, focusing on stand-alone, comprehensive LCPs that were developed with climate change mitigation and/or adaptation as the main motivation. The study addresses two principal researchquestions: /C15What are the emerging patterns of LCPs' distribution across the EU-28? /C15How can the overall pattern be explained, i.e. what is the relativeinfluence of local, national or international policies and net- works on the development of LCPs? The focus of the work is on the distribution of stand-alone LCPs and the factors driving their development. In contrast to stand- alone LCPs, the mainstreaming of climate issues in other policies or climate related plans is not considered here. This, together with the quality of LCPs and their content are subject to future research. A previous study, conducted on a smaller sample of 200 cities across 11 EU Member States revealed a large variation in climate change response, which was most noticeable on a north esouth axis (Reckien et al., 2014a ). A follow-up investigation ( Heidrich et al., 2016 ) already discussed the respective roles of national legisla- tion and international networks in motivating the developmentand implementation of local climate strategies on that smaller sample. A related study also examined the potential of speci c institutional, environmental and socio-economic urban character- istics to act as drivers of, or barriers to climate action ( Reckien et al., 2015 ). The analysis presented here represents a signi cant advance on these studies, in the number of cities analysed and the breadth of information considered, paving the way for more detailed consideration of the engagement and preparedness of European cities in response to climate change. 2. Methodology and methods 2.1. The sample of cities The analysis is based on the entire sample of 885 UA core cities in the EU-28, and uses some of the data provided in the UA data- base, 3which is now called \"Statistics on European cities \". The UA city sample currently contains 885 core cities and 22 greater citiesor larger urban zones across the EU-28, plus a number of cities in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. The more than 900 cities in the EU-28 together represent 25% of the EU's population. The UA denes a city as a local administration unit (LAU) where the ma- jority of the population lives in an urban centre of at least approximately 50,000 inhabitants. However, as explained below, to ensure representativeness within countries and across the EU-28, the UA also includes some smaller urban centres with less the 50,000 inhabitants. The UA adopted the following criteria in order to ensure a balanced and regionally representative sample (see Fig. 1 ): cities in each country should represent about 20% of the population in the country, have a good geographical distribution (at least one city from each NUT3 Region), and vary in size to include large and small cities (including some urban centres with less than 50,000 inhabitants). The UA is run by the European Commission and Eurostat (2017) and has been developed in cooperation with the national statistical ofces to compare data across European urban areas. Datasets include statistical information on individual cities and on theircommuting zones (called 'Functional Urban Areas '). The topics and datasets that are reported by the database are wide ranging andinclude, for example, demography, housing, health, environment, and education. The database is a very useful resource for climate 3http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Statistics_on_ European_cities (last accessed: 26 May 2017); http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/ cities/data/database (last accessed 19th December 2017).D. Reckien et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 191 (2018) 207 e219 209 57change policy makers and urban planners alike ( Seto et al., 2014 ). For more details on the methodology, de nition and classi cations used in the analysis see Supplementary Information and Eurostat (2004) . 2.2. Typology of local climate plans The LCPs of European cities are drafted and published in a va- riety of forms, and vary in terms of detail, structure and scope. Some of the plans are comprehensive stand-alone documents, such as comprehensive adaptation or mitigation plans. Other LCPs are integrated into another document such as a sustainability plan, resilience plan, or Local Agenda 21, and these sometimes integrateadaptation and mitigation. Increasingly, aspects of climate change are also covered by spatial development plans; sectoral plans, e.g. air quality plans or emergency response plans (for heat waves, flooding, or energy shortages); and plans prepared for other pur- poses but which are nevertheless relevant to climate change. Due to the multitude of planning constellations and types of LCPs available we developed a typology of LCPs that also serves as a framework for analysis. It is based on two dimensions: the align- ment with spatial (local, national and international) policies and level of integration with other local policy documents ( Table 1 ). This study only considers plans with a clear focus on climate changeand those developed for an entire urban area as stand-alone doc- uments, i.e. those de ned as type A1, A2, and A3 plans according to Fig. 1. Map of the location of Eurostat Urban Audit cities, showing resident populations as of 1st January 2012. Source: Eurostat (2015) .D. Reckien et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 191 (2018) 207 e219 210 58the typology set out in Table 1 . Types A1 and A2: In this category we included LCPs relevant for the entire urban area that mention 'climate 'or 'climate change' in the title or, in the introduction, and identify responding to climate change as main motivation for producing the plan. These plans were detected using common search engines, entering search terms such as 'climate change mitigation planning 'and 'climate change adaptation planning '(see Supplementary Information ). In addition, we reviewed websites of municipal authorities, focusing on those departments that might cover climate action (e.g., plan- ning, energy, sustainable development). Type A3: In absence of type A1/A2 LCPs we checked for plans that have been developed under the auspices of international climate networks (in particular the EU Covenant of Mayors and the UN Compact of Mayors). We extracted and noted the presence of a Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) (for mitigation), or a Sus- tainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) (combining mitigation and adaptation), developed for the Covenant of Mayors. 2.3. Selection of local climate plans for the Urban Audit cities sample For each country, a team of authors (with native or full profes- sional language pro ciency) compiled a database of local climate (mitigation and adaptation) plans through a combination of desk/ web review and occasionally direct contact with local authorities.We took advantage opportunities to obtain the information we needed online and only contacted the respective city representa- tive(s) in cases where further information and/or clari cation were needed. In all cases the respective plan or policy had to be, or to bemade available to us. A more comprehensive version of the analysis guidelines can be found in the Supplementary Information . The information extracted was entered into a database, where the name of the mitigation and adaptation strategy, the web link, and the date of search was recorded, along with comments on particularities of each city. The relevant documents where down- loaded and saved. The LCP may either be of cially adopted by the municipal gov- ernment, or simply acknowledged and noted; it may be binding or non-binding. The database includes draft and nalized plans as well as current and past strategies, i.e. including those with a timeframe that had already expired (e.g. 2010 e2016). We included draft documents because we assume that the planning process is just as important as the plan itself ( Heidrich et al., 2013 ;Millard- Ball, 2013 ) and that a draft plan can already produce effects such as awareness raising and capacity building. The size of a municipality or local area differs across Europe and this has implications for what counts as local climate plan. For example, in France, municipalities are small compared to other countries. This motivated the transfer of the competence for LCPs from municipalities to city-regions (larger urban areas) as part of the territorial reform enacted in 2015. We recorded both municipalTable 1 Typology of Local Climate Plans (LCPs).

A similar issue relates to cities in Ireland and the UK, where one city can make up multiple local authorities (Heidrich et al., 2013 ). In these cases, we reported plans for local authorities within a city (e.g. London). Type A1 and A2 LCPs were searched for between November 2016 and January 2017. Subsequently, in May 2017, information on type A3 climate plans developed under the auspices of interna- tional urban networks (e.g. Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, Compact of Mayors) was retrieved from the organizations ' websites. 3. Results This section summarizes our ndings and provides a compre- hensive overview of the current state of development of LCPs across the EU-28. As mentioned above, we report only on LCPs of types A1, A2, and A3, as de ned in Table 1 , in order to focus on cities with stand-alone plans that comprehensively address climate change. 3.1. Type A1: autonomous and comprehensive LCPs National governments in 24 of the EU-28 countries do not require the preparation of LCPs. In these countries, LCP develop- ment is the result of local level engagement and action. Table 2shows the large disparities in the prevalence of LCPs across these 24 European countries. Overall, approximately 37% of the cities in this sample have an A1 mitigation plan. They are particularly numerous in Poland, Germany, Ireland, Finland and Sweden, where more than two- thirds of cities have a mitigation plan. Across the EU-24 sample, about 11% of cities have an A1 adap- tation plan; thus overall there are far fewer adaptation plans than mitigation plans. Finland is a forerunner in this respect, with most cities having an adaptation plan. Less than one-third of cities have adaptation plans in 12 other countries, while adaptation plans are non-existent in the remaining 11 countries. The fact that mitigation plans are far more numerous than adaptation plans might suggest that mitigation planning precedes adaptation planning. However, there are some cities with an adaptation plan but no mitigation plan. These include, for example, Zagreb (Croatia) and Bologna and Ancona (Italy). Some of the plans address mitigation and adaptation issues in the same document. This is the case in most Finnish cities, but also in some Irish cities. However, overall only 3% of type A1 LCPs in Europe are joint plans. Overall, 10 of the 24 countries that do not require LCPs do not have any cities with local A1 mitigation or adaptation plans. The countries concerned, apart from two small countries with a single UA city (Luxembourg and Malta), are located in the south, south- east and north-east of Europe.Table 2 Number of autonomous mitigation, adaptation and joint plans in Urban Audit Cities in 24 EU countries where the development of LCPs is not compulsory (A1).

Reckien et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 191 (2018) 207 e219 212 60Fig. 2 shows how the LCPs in countries without national legis- lation requiring the development of LCPs are distributed across city size. The proportion of cities with an A1 mitigation plan and/or an A1 adaptation plan increases in line with their size. Around 80% of cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants have a mitigation and/or adaptation plan. Fig. 2 shows that some of the smallest urban cen- tres, with less than 50,000 inhabitants, are also addressing the challenges of climate change; however the data in that category is far from representative, because of the small sample size. Joint plans are more likely to be developed in large cities but not exclusive to them, suggesting a relation to economic or institutional capacity. 3.2. Type A2: Nationally required and regulated LCPs While many national governments provide some policy guid- ance to local authorities on the production and design of LCPs, their content and legal status is usually left to the discretion of local authorities. Only 4 countries, Denmark (DK), France (FR), Slovakia (SK) and the United Kingdom (UK), have made the adoption of LCPs compulsory, determining their legal status and providing guidance on the development and content of plans. Since 2008, local planning authorities in the UK have a statutory duty to include \"policies designed to secure that the development and use of land in the local planning authority's area contribute to the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change \"in their local planning documents.4The legislation demands the inclusion of climate change issues in general local planning documents addressing both mitigation and adaptation. The regulation applies to local planning authorities of all sizes. In 2010, France made it compulsory for municipalities to adopt LCPs. The French local authorities are required to produce a Local Climate-Air-Energy Plan ( Plan Climat Air Energie Territorial ), which is a stand-alone document. It must include sections on mitigationand adaptation, but most often the focus is mitigation and partic- ularly the link between energy policy, air quality and GHG emis- sions. However, these regulations only apply to areas with a certain number of inhabitants. Initially, LCPs were compulsory for munic- ipalities of more than 50,000 inhabitants, but the scope of the regulations was expanded to cover smaller-sized urban areas in2016. Since then LCPs have been obligatory for municipalities with more than 20,000 inhabitants. In Slovakia, local authorities are obliged to develop an Action Plan for Sustainable Energy (e.g. Ak/C20cn\u00fd pl /C19an 2020 ), which are strategic framework documents related to climate change mitigation. The requirement to develop these plans is set out in the National Energy Policy and the National Framework and Energy Strategy of the Slovak Re- public, which relate in turn to obligations stemming from EU di- rectives 2006/32/EC (relating to energy end-use ef ciency and 2012/27/EU (relating to energy ef ciency), and 2003/87/EC (relating to emissions trading). Cities are required to take measures to improve the ef ciency of public services and to influence energy consumption by key stakeholders and end users. In Denmark, only local climate change adaptation plans are le- gally required, whereas mitigation plans are voluntary. However,mitigation LCPs are indirectly demanded as a component of mandatory municipal heat supply plans, which are required by law and aim to reduce the energy sector's dependence on fossil fuels ( x1 in the Danish Heat Supply Law [LBK no. 523]). 5Mitigation is dealt with by the Danish Climate Law [LOV no. 716], which came into force in 2014 and whose goal is for Denmark to become a 'low emission society 'in 2050.6Regarding adaptation, in 2013, the then Environment Minister Ida Auken made it mandatory for Danish municipalities to include climate change adaptation into municipal spatial plansd a requirement integrated into the Danish planning law since February 2018. Accordingly, municipalities are required to identify local areas that may be exposed to flooding and erosion as a result of climate change and designate these areas as such in themunicipal spatial plans. If urban developments are planned in these designated areas, the municipalities have to ensure the imple- mentation of preventive measures. Moreover, Denmark is among the few countries with a Ministry of Climate, which was created in the wake of the UNFCCC Conference in Copenhagen in 2009. Table 3 shows the number of mitigation, adaptation and joint LCPs produced in the UA cities of Denmark, France, Slovakia and the Fig. 2.

Some basic analyses show that cities with a national obligation to develop LCPs are approximately 1.8 times more likely to have a mitigation plan and about 5.0 times more likely to have an adaptation plandalthough this is also in fluenced by the length of time the regulation has been in force. Moreover, our sample indicates thatthe large majority of all joint mitigation and adaptation plans (86.8%) in the EU were produced in cities of two countries (France and the UK) with national climate legislation that require and provide guidance for the development of LCPs. However, compli- ance with the legislation is not universal: one in four cities in France and one in three in the UK do not possess a LCP of type A2 and thus may not be complying with national legislation. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of type A2 LCPs across city size in the four countries where they are compulsory. The data reveals thesame pattern as for autonomously produced (type A1) LCPs in other countries. Larger cities are more likely to have an LCP than smaller cities and compliance rates are 100% in cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants. 3.3. Type A3: plans of international climate networks International climate networks are initiatives that play animportant role in boosting development of urban local climate plans ( Heidrich et al., 2016 ;Reckien et al., 2014b ). While there are also regional and national climate networks in many countries, theEU Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and the UN Compact of Mayors are the most important initiatives at the international level. The Covenant of Mayors brings together some 7000 local and regional authorities voluntarily committed to implementing EU climate and energy objectives on their territory. It was launched by the European Commission (EC) after the adoption of the 2020 EU Climate and Energy Package in 2008, with the aim of endorsing and supporting the efforts of local authorities to reduce GHG emissions and implement sustainable energy policies. The Covenant of Mayors asks signatories to prepare so-called Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs). These are envisaged as roadmaps, charting the paths of EU cities towards the goal of reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions by 20% by 2020. For adaptation, a similar network initiatived Mayors Adapt dwas launched in 2014, inviting cities to make political commitments and take action to prepare for the impacts of climate change. At the end of 2015, both initiatives merged under the new integrated Covenant of Mayors for Climate &Energy. The new Covenant of Mayors asks signatories to prepare Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans (SECAPs), containing a commitment to the EU 2030 objectives to reduce CO 2emissions byTable 3 Number of mitigation, adaptation and joint plans in four countries where LCPs are compulsory (A2) compared with other countries.

As part of their commit- ment, cities agree to perform a series of key activities on mitigation and adaptation, including carrying out an inventory, creating tar- gets and metrics, and establishing a local climate action and adaptation plan.8 Both initiatives have been successful in encouraging cities to address the challenge of climate change.

Reckien et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 191 (2018) 207 e219 215 63Mayors has been very successful in Europe and the UN Compact of Mayors successfully engaged many cities throughout the world. A Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy was launched in June 20169aimed at linking the two initiatives to generate syn- ergies and avoid duplication, especially among EU local authorities. In this section we present ndings on participation in the Covenant of Mayors and Compact of Mayors, by UA cities in EU-28countries. Table 4 shows that 356 or 40% out of 885 UA cities are signatories of the Covenant of Mayors. Among them, 333 cities (38%) have a SEAP, 10 cities (1%) have a SECAP and 93 cities (10.5%) have an adaptation commitment (some of them as SECAP). The status of all cities in the Covenant process is on average 2.1 (stage 1 - signature, stage 2 - action plan submitted, stage 3 - results monitored), showing that most cities have submitted an action plan and some already monitor their results. Countries where, on average, cities have reached the highest stage in the Covenant of Mayors process include Croatia, Lithuania and Portugal. Table 4 also shows that 8% of the UA cities in our sample are members in the Compact of Mayors. They are on average at stage 1.6 in the process (stage 1- register commitment, stage 2 - take inventory, stage 3 - set reduction targets, stage 4 - create plan(s) to address climate mitigation and/or adaptation), signifying that many cities of the Compact network are still at stage 1 and have not yet carried out an inventory. Comparing this with Table 2 we conclude that cities in countrieswhere autonomous (type A2) plans are less common are more likely to produce internationally accredited plans, whereas cities in countries where autonomous plans are more common tend to engage less in international networks. Table 5 summarizes the statistics and shows that A1 and A2 LCPs are slightly more numerous (total 398 for mitigation and 223 for adaptation) than A3 LCPs (total 333 for mitigation and 103 for adaptation). It further shows that 66.2% of EU UA cities have either an A1, A2, or A3 mitigation LCP, 25.5% have an adaptation LCP, 16.4% have joint LCPs; have no type A1, A2 or A3 LCP. Thendings regarding the distribution of type A1, A2 and A3 LCPs across countries and European regions are summarised in Fig. 4 . Cities in eastern and southern Europe have fewer mitigation and adaptation LCPs, whereas most central and northern Europeancities have a LCP. The prevalence of types of LCPs is often clustered in countries. 4. Discussion and conclusion Our dataset includes 885 cities in all 28 EU countries, and is the rst to provide a detailed database of local climate action. It is thus much more comprehensive and representative than previous similar studies. It contributes towards establishing patterns of local climate action and assessing the effectiveness of action by cities in support of EU policy targets geared towards combating climate change and meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Data collected for this study was last updated in January 2017 (with some exceptions, e.g. climate networks). This allowed plans developed in the wake and immediately after the 2015 UNFCCCTable 4 Number of UA cities in the EU-28 signatory to the Covenant of Mayors (CoM, 2020 goal), Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (CoM, 2030 goal), and the Compact of Mayors (A3), with average stage in each process.

This paper has presented the data and provided an initial analysis. We intend to update this work at regular intervals to map, observe and compare the evolution of local climate planning over time. This will continuously inform decision making and thinking by stakeholders at all levels and across sectors. 4.1. Methodological challenges and insights 1)The accessibility of LCPs can be challenging, especially for medium and small-sized cities. In a few cases, there was some evidence of the existence of LCPs, but no copy of the plan available. While we are sure to have found the vast majority of LCPs for our sample, some LCPs might exist that are not publicly available on the webpages of the municipalities concerned. 2)The use of the typology across countries proved challenging.Despite the co-development of the typology and analytical framework by members of the research team, a framework that clearly distinguished comprehensive, mainstreamed, partial and related plans, the application of the framework to the different national situations proved dif cult at times. For example, it was difcult to know which plan came rst when cities had both an A1/A2 and A3 plan. We recorded most of them as A1/A2, unless it was absolutely clear that the plan was developed initially for the Covenant of Mayors. Similarly, it was sometimes dif cult to distinguish between types of plans considered in this paper (A1, A2 and A3) and plans assigned to the other categories (i.e. B, C, D, E, and F) that were excluded from our analysis. For example, the distinction between A3 plans and Local Energy Plans (type 3) is not always straightforward. It should also be noted that, while the typology might suggest a hierarchy (of commitment or effectiveness) from A down to F, this was not intended and the typology should not be interpreted in this way. The typology distinguishes among different approaches adopted by cities in addressing the challenge of climate change but does not imply that one approach is 'better 'than others. For example, type B plans can be more successful than type A plans in addressing and implementing climate change issues in the real world, by mainstreaming climate change-related issues in other local policy processes. The classi cation of plans was also made more difcult by the fact that mitigation and adaptation are not al- ways dealt with at the same level of detail, depth, or length. Moreover, while in some countries there is a recent trend to- wards including LCPs into broader sustainability plans (as in theNetherlands), in other countries an opposite trend can beobserved (as in France, where local Agenda 21s are being transformed into more technical and narrow LCPs). In this paper, we did not include sustainability plans or local Agenda 21s. As a result we may have underestimated the level of climate engagement in European cities. 3)Evolving local governance structures complicated the anal- ysis. Local government reforms can have a signi cant impact on local climate planning, when competences are moved from one level to the other. For instance, when France merged a large number of smaller municipal authorities into larger 'inter- municipal 'ones, competence for development of LCPs moved 'up'to the higher level. By contrast, Italy has transformed its provinces, which were previously responsible for most urban planning, into large inter-municipal authorities. In some cases, this made existing plans obsolete, thus creating a legal 'in- betweenness 'that we found dif cult to characterise. In this assessment, we included the lowest-level plans (e.g. municipal over inter-municipal), unless more recent higher-level plans existed in a context of territorial reform. Furthermore, lower- level plans interact with higher-level plans in the respective spatial planning systems. This is particularly salient in the case of water and climate plans and adaptation plans in general, which usually cover larger areas, such as in the Netherlands, Finland, and Italy. To maintain consistency we therefore also included plans for metropolitan regions (larger urban areas including a number of municipalities that are part of the UA). For example, the metropolitan region of Helsinki has a plan that also covers the adjacent UA cities of Esbo, Vanda and Lahtis. It should also be mentioned that the restriction to UA cities introduces a distortion of representability. In some countries (e.g. Portugal where UA cities cover only 8% of municipalities), urban centres outside the UA may have LCPs that were not recorded in this study. 4.2. Interpretation of the ndings 1)The drivers of LCPs in countries without national legislation to develop LCPs need further exploration din many of those countries more than 2/3 of cities have LCPs. Some countries stood out as having a large proportion (two-thirds or more) of UA cities with autonomously developed (type A1) mitigation plans. These included Poland (97.8% coverage), Germany (80.8%), Ireland (80.0), Finland (77.8%) and Sweden (76.9%). This prevalence of LCPs could be due to several factors, such as theTable 5 Number of mitigation, adaptation and joint plans of Type A1, A2, and A3. Please note that we count the existence of a SECAP and Adapt Commitment as A3 adaptation LCP, because no more detailed information was available. Key: w/o \u00bcwithout.D. Reckien et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 191 (2018) 207 e219 217 65level of climate awareness, the presence of local expertise, the level of administrative decentralization, the presence of insti- tutional capacity or political commitment, the impact of politi- cal parties and the amount of funding available. Further research is needed to elucidate which factors contribute the most and how they interact with each other and other factors. 2)The existence of national regulation has a signi cant impact on local climate planning. Cities in Denmark, France, Slovakia and the UK, where LCPs are compulsory, are about 1.8 times more likely to have a mitigation plan, and 5.0 times more likely to have an adaptation plan than cities in other coun- triesd although this is also in fluenced by the length of time the regulation has been in place. The case of Denmark, where all four UA cities have both mitigation plans and adaptation plans, is particularly interesting. Moreover, our sample indicates that almost all joint mitigation and adaptation plans (86.2% of the total joint plans) were produced in France and the UK. It seems that, without national regulation, local authorities are reluctant or do not have the capacity to produce joint plans. It is worth highlighting that French and British cities represent about 30% of all UA cities and are therefore particularly well-represented in the sample. 3)There are countries where a signi cant number of LCPs were developed under the auspices of Covenant of Mayors. These included, most notably, Cyprus, Denmark, Slovenia, Latvia(100.0% of UA cities), Finland (88.9%), Belgium (81.8%), Ireland (80.0%), (76.9%), Italy Portugal (64.0%), Romania (62.9%) and Spain (60.6%). Within our sample, the EU Covenant of Mayors has ve times as many signatories as the UN Compact of Mayors. No country has a signi cant number of members of Mayors Adapt. In the light of these results, we conclude that, in countries where autonomous (type A1) LCPs are rare and cities are not required by national legislation to develop plans, international networks such as the Covenant of Mayors help raise awareness, build capacity and, often through EU-funded projects, provide the expertise and the funding necessary to develop LCPs. The cases of Spain and Italy are particularly interesting, as the number of Spanish and Italian signatories is particularly high. They represent more than one- third (35.0%) of the signatories of the Covenant of Mayors in our sample (and more than three-quarters (76.7%) of the total signatories to the Covenant of Mayors at the time of writing). However, UA cities are probably not a representative sample of local authorities that are signatory to the Covenant of Mayors, considering that the UA contains only few urban areas with less than 50,000 inhabitants, while local authorities of all sizes can sign the Covenant. This is the case for Malta, where several smaller cities that make up part of the Valletta UA city have submitted action plans to the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy but these do not cover the entire UA city. Actions promoted by the Covenant of Mayors also differ from the plans considered in this study in other ways: the Covenant of Mayors is mostly focused on what the local authority owns, rather than the city as a whole; the timeframe is often different; and plans can cover administrative areas with populations ranging from a few hundred people to several million. This means that, while our sample can be considered as representative of European cities, dened as urban centres with (in most cases) more than 50,000 inhabitants, it is not fully representative of the signatories of theCovenant. Future research should assess how promotion of climate plans by the Covenant of Mayors interacts with other factors driving the development of LCPs in European cities. This is the most comprehensive analysis of local climate plan- ning to date. However, we acknowledge the limitations of a studyon the existence of LCPs for climate mitigation and adaptationachievements. Although our sample includes LCPs that have been adopted years ago and could therefore potentially prove successful implementation the analysis of planning and policy documents cannot. It is yet to determine whether and to what extent cities in Europe are acting on and moving towards adaptation and mitiga- tion goals. Our sample allows for larger objectivity than previous studies, although, as mentioned above, it may still underestimate climate engagement in smaller cities and of other types than stand- alone, comprehensive LCPs. 4.3. Final conclusions Our analysis of 885 cities across the 28 European countries has shown that approximately 66% of the EU UA cities have either an A1, A2, or A3 mitigation LCP; that 26% have an adaptation LCP; 16% are joint LCPs; and about 33% of cities have neither an A1, nor an A2 or an A3 LCP. Although far more numerous, mitigation plans do not always precede adaptation plans, which is different from the conclusions of earlier assessments ( Reckien et al., 2014a ;b). There is large diversity in the proportions of cities with different types of plans across the EU, with generally more plans in central and northern EU countries, which agrees with the results of previous studies. City size, inter- national climate networks and national regulation are in fluential parameters in driving the development of LCPs. About 80% of thecities with more than 500,000 inhabitants have an A1 or A2 miti- gation and/or an adaptation plan. We also found that the EU Covenant of Mayors has an important role to play in encouraging smaller cities, notably in Italy and Spain, but also in many other countries, to engage in climate action. Overall, though, LCPs developed independently (type A1) as well as in response to na- tional legislation (type A2) are more numerous in European coun- tries than LCPs developed as part of international climate networks (type A3). The prevalence of LCPs is greater in countries that require local authorities to develop LCPs than in those that do not, by a factor of 1.8 for mitigation and a factor of 5.0 for adaptation.

Introduction Cities are places of high overall primary energy consumption and high GHG emissions ( Sims et al., 2007). Moreover, the growing urba- nization and the complex patterns of urban economic assets, infra- structure and services make cities also particularly vulnerable to cli- matechange( Geneletti&Zardo,2016; IPCC,2012).Hence,improving climatemitigationandadaptationstrategiesinurbanareasiscrucialfor sustainable development, a role that cities increasingly take on (Rosenzweig, Solecki, Hammer, & Mehrotra, 2010 supportingtheireorts(ICLEI,2010). Among pathways, climate planning at the local levelisakeyavenuetomainstreammitigationandadaptationactions (Measham et al., 2011). Cities are the ideal framework forimplementinglow-carbonpolicies(Gouldsonetal.,2015 )andadapta- tionstrategiesthroughastrategicplanningprocesssharedwithcitizens andlocalstakeholders(Geels,2011).Inthewordsof Picketts,D\u00e9ry,and Curry(2013),climateadaptationplanning\"iswellsuitedtolocallevelsof governments, strategieswillprovidetangiblebenetstolocalresidents\".Asshownby reviewsofplanningdocumentsundertakenforEuropeancities(Reckien ), Italy and Spain (DeGregorioHurtadoetal.,2015),Australia( Baker,Peterson,Brown, & McAlpine, 2012) and North America (Zimmerman & Faris, 2011 ), urbanplanninghasincreasinglybeenaddressingclimatemitigationand adaptationissues(Kumar&Geneletti,2015). Regarding the content of Local 2/GHG-reduction target of about 37%. Moreover,thestudypointedoutthatmitigationmeasuresconcentratedmostly on energy saving, energy eciency and renewables, thus fo- cusingonlyontheenergysector.Ontheotherhand,adaptationplans were found to be broader in their scope and rather vague dealing, for instance, with urban planning and management, water management, awareness raising, etc. Concrete measures were seldom mentioned. Also,Baker et al. (2012, p. 127) summarize for Australia that \"local governments were not eectively planning for climate impacts. While theywereawareofexpectedclimatechangeimpacts,theircapacityto usethisinformationtodevelopgeographicallyspecicactionplanswas limited.\"ThelackofLCPsisoftenconnectedtoalackofresourcesand capacity of local governments to tend to climate planning ( Reckien et al., 2015). It is also related to multi-level governance systems inwhichtheupperlevelsofgovernmentdonotsetpolicyframeworksthat encourage and guide local climate action ( De Gregorio Hurtado et al., 2014),whichisparticularlyimportantinthecaseofmediumandsmall cities. To overcome the lack of policy references and resources, many European cities use the services of climate-related national or trans- national networks of local authorities, particularly when national and regionalguidelinesandsupportareabsent.Thisisthesituationinmany Southern and Eastern European countries and ( Baker et al., 2012), particularly to cities in vulnerable locations (along rivers, coasts) and without resources (adaptive capa- city,highunemployment)(Reckienetal.,2015 ). As pointedout bythe IntergovernmentalPanelon ClimateChange (IPCC) the basin is one of the main climate change hotspot,thatis,oneofthemostresponsiveareastoclimatechange.In this region, Italian cities are particularly vulnerableto climate change and are already experiencing a rise in temperatures and increases in water scarcity, frequency of floods, forest res, windstorms and storm surges.AdossierofLegambiente,thelargestenvironmentalassociation inItaly(Legambiente,2018)showsthat198Italianmunicipalitieshave been aected by negative impacts of climate change, from 2010 to 2018, recording 340 extreme weather events, 109 cases of infra- structuredamagedfrom heavyrainfall,and157peoplevictimsofbad weather. This study aims at contributing to the mentioned studies by ana- lysing urban climate actions in Italy, focusing at how these vulner- abilities are level that contain policies that are relevant for climate change mitigationandadaptation.Thisgeneraltermisusedbecause:(i)some aspects of spatial planning in Italy are regulated at the regional level, hence dierent regions may adopt dierent terminology and require dierent content for their planning instruments; (ii) climate adapta- tion/mitigation-relevant content can be found in the country also in urban planning instruments or in documents that focus on issues dif- ferent from, or broader than climate change (e.g., civil defence and emergencyplans). Toourknowledge,thisisthesecondstudyofthiskindinItaly,only precededbyonethatcanbeconsideredastheresearchbackgroundof thisstudy,conductedonasmallersampleofplans(UA-3from Eurostat, 2007) and with a simplied review framework than the one proposed here(DeGregorioHurtadoetal.,2015).Thisrststudyrevealedsomedynamism in LCPs, such as identication of ambitious emission re- duction targets; holistic approaches to mitigation strategies; it also found shortcomings in the information baseline and implementation measures of proposed strategies. There is also a report to share the experience of Italy at the international level, which uses an even smaller subset of cities, looks for good practices and focuses more on thecompetencesoflocalauthorities(Church,2013).Thisstudypoints out the high level of decentralization of climate planning despite re- sponsibilitythatisstillwiththecentralgovernment,aswellasthegreat variety of measures, where research, innovation and competitiveness oftenplayanimportantrole. Thepurposeofthispaperistomakestepsforwardintheassessment of the development of local climate planning in Italy, to identify and discuss the main shortcomings of the plans related to the im- plementation of plans and measures, Italy's climate goals, and inter- national agreements, and propose recommendations for the improve- ment of the plans and the policy framework in which the plans are developed. Particularly, our analysis addresses the following main re- searchquestions: HowItaliancitiesareawareofimpactsofclimatechangeandhow theyareacting? Howambitiousarethemitigationpoliciesofcities? Whatcitiesaredoingtocopewiththeirclimatevulnerabilities? Whatmitigationandadaptationtopicsandinstruments(withasso-ciatedactorsandfundingmechanisms)arecontainedinLCP? Section 2provides an overview of the Italian context related to mitigation and adaptation planning. Section 3describes our methods for selecting the sample of cities and identifying the relevant LCPs. It alsopresentsthereviewprotocolthatwasusedtoanalysethecontent of the plans. Our results are illustrated and discussed in Section 4.F i - nally,someconclusionsandrecommendationsarepresentedin Section 5. 2. The Italian National Framework on mitigation and adaptation Incompliancewiththe1997KyotoProtocol,theItalianMinistryfor the Environment, Land and Sea (IMELS) supported the development andimplementationofthe2002NationalActionPlantoreduceGHGs andiscurrentlypreparinganewNationalPlanforEnergyandClimate, consistentlywiththeParisAgreement.Atthesametime,theMinistryof Economic Development released the Italian National Energy Strategy (SEN) (MISE, 2017), which aims at achieving and exceeding the en- vironmental and decarbonisation targets established by the 2008 Cli-mateandEnergyPackage(\"20-20-20\"package)oftheEuropeanUnion andtakeonaleadingroleindeningandimplementingtheRoadmap 2050.Inparticular,accordingtotheSEN,ItalyintendstoreduceGHG emissionsof39%by2030and63%by2050respectto1990levels. Concerning adaptation, the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change ( IMELS, 2014) was approved in October 2014, al- thoughseveralsectoral strategicdocumentshavealreadyincludedcli-mate change adaptation aspects (e.g., National Biodiversity Strategy, WhitePaperonChallengesandOpportunitiesforRuralDevelopmentto Mitigate and Adapt to Climate Change). The National Strategy for Adaptationto ClimateChange ( IMELS,2014) provides anoverview of the impacts of climate change in several socio-economic sectors and naturalsystems,identifyingasetofactionsandadaptationmeasuresto address these impacts. The portfolio of actions and measures selected havetobecarefullyevaluatedandselectedthroughappropriatecriteria in the National Adaptation Plan to Climate Change which is, in ac- cordancewiththeEEAdenition,\"amoredetaileddocumentproviding a roadmap for the implementation of specic adaptation actions that arebeingplanned\"(EEA,2013,p.68). TheItalianNationalAdaptationPlantoClimateChangeiscurrently administered by the IMELS that, in October and integrations from in- stitutionalstakeholders,butithasn'tbeapprovedsofar.Inparticular,a comprehensive questionnaire was set to investigate the perceptions of impactsandvulnerabilitiesandtocollectactionstocopewithclimate changeandawidepublicconsultationontherstdraftwascarriedout involvingcitizens,associationsandstakeholders. The processes to dene the Strategy and the Plan have been quite dierent. In the case of the Strategy, a wide process of collaborative involvementofscienticcommunitiesofdierentdisciplineshasbeen organisedbothinthedenitionandintheprocessofreviewing.Inthe case of the Plan the process of consultation followed a more oriented 'top down' approach, involving sectoral scientic communities only afterthepublicationofarstplanproposal.Lookinginparticularatthe sections dedicated to urban environments, the range of actions pro- posed inthePlan reveala disconnectionwithlocalandregional plan- ningsystems-inallcases-astheydonotincludepotentialimplications withthelegalframeworkofregionalplanning,thatinItalyrepresents the main asset for local and urban governance. The Plan risks being impossibletoimplement,becauseoflackoftechnicaltoolstointegrate actionsinordinaryplanningprocesses.Itisthereforenecessarytofocus on the urban level to understand the role of Italian cities in the fra- meworkofthenationalclimatepolicies,asoutlinedby Heidrichetal. (2016). 2.1. Focus on the urban level The current Italian legislation lacks National laws binding munici- palities to develop any kind of plan or strategy aimed at reducing greenhousegasesoradaptingcitiestoclimatechange.Anexceptionis provided by the Municipal Energy Plan (Piano Energetico Comunale - PEC), introducedbythe1991nationalLaw(ItalianLaw10/1991 ,art. 5) for cities with more than 50,000 citizens, and the Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility (Piano Urbano della Mobilit\u00e0 Sostenibile -PUMS), more recently introduced by a national Decree from the Ministry ofInfrastructure and Transport (Decree n. 257, art. 3, 2016 ) for munici- palities and associations thereof with more than 100,000 inhabitants.Thus, on the one hand, larger cities have developed, and sometimes upgraded,theirMunicipalEnergyPlan,aimedatidentifyingthecurrent energybalanceandprogrammingenergysavingandrenewableenergy interventions, with positive repercussions on the reduction of GHG emission. On the other hand, the newly introduced Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility will allow cities to take action on sustainable mobility witha medium tolong-term (10-year)horizon, but andcommunalscale. cities have assumed an increasingly important role,movedoriginallybytheirinteresttoplantheirfutureinlinewith sustainabilitycriteria( DeGregorioHurtadoetal.,2014). In 2008, a new urban initiative launched by the European Union caught the interest of many Italian cities: the Covenant of Mayors (CoM). This network was established after the adoption of the 2020 European Union Climate and Energy Package to endorse and support the eorts deployed by localauthorities inthe implementation of sus- tainable energy policies. The CoM has had a big echo among Italian mayors,reachingthehighestnumberofsignatorycitiesinEurope.Asa result, many Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs) have been de- veloped in Italy, formalizing the political commitment of Mayors to curbGHGemissionsontheirterritorybyatleast20%by2020. As concerns adaptation, the Covenant of Mayors Initiative on Climate Change Adaptation (Mayors Adapt), launched in 2013 in the framework of the EU Adaptation Strategy, was merged with the Covenant of Mayors and from 2017 onwards was entirely integrated intothenewCovenantofMayorsforClimateandEnergywhich\"pledge to reduce CO 2emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and to adopt an in- tegrated approach to tackling mitigation and adaptation to climatechange\" (Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, 2017 ). Signa- tories of the new Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy now commit to prepare and implement Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans (SECAP). Recently, Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy,2018 andtheCompactofMayors(2017),anothercitynetwork addressing climate change launched at the 2014 United Nations Cli- mate Summit in New York, have come together to form the Global CovenantofMayorsforClimate&Energy,aimingatcombiningeorts andleadershiptoaccelerateclimateactionatthelocallevelworldwide (EC,2016). 3. Methodology Following the methodological approach utilized in the EU-28 ana- lysis(Reckienetal.,2018 ),twomainissueswerewidelydebatedatthe beginning of the study in order to setup the methodological approach and to fully address our research questions concerning the assessment of local climate planning in Italy. First, which Local Climate Plans (LCPs)neededtobeinvestigatedinourcasestudyand,second,which citiescouldbeincludedintheItaliansample. Anexhaustivedescriptionofhowthesetwoissueswereaddressedin ourstudyisreportedinthefollowingsections. 3.1. The LCPs under focus In Italy, there is no national legal requirement to adopt Local ClimatePlans,asstand-alonedocuments.Inthisstudy,weinvestigated the availability of planning documents or strategies focusing on miti- gation (M), adaptation (A) or addressing mitigation and adaptation together(M/A). To prioritize all these planning documents in order of strategic importance we introduced a three-level analysis framework based on (Reckien et al., 2018 ). As depicted in Fig. 1, we started our analysis searching comprehensive and stand-alone plans (Level 1). Then, weassessedwhethertheyhadbeendevelopedautonomously(Level1-A)or hadbeeninducedbyinternationalurbanclimatenetworks(Level1-B). Forthosecitieswithoutcomprehensiveplans,wealsoinvestigatedthe availabilityofsectoralplansaddressingsingleaspectsofclimatechange in stand-alone documents (Level 2) and, absence, on climate- relatedlocal-levelplans(Level3). Inparticular,thisapproachwasbasedonthefollowingdenitions.Comprehensive and stand -alone(Level 1): In this category, we in- cluded stand-alone documents relevant for the entire urban area and that at least mention 'climate' or 'climate change' in the title or as a main motivation of the plan development in the introduction. We in- troduced a further distinction with regard to the framework in which theyweredeveloped: Autonomously developed (Level 1-A): Adaptation/mitigation plans developedbyalocalgovernment,independentlyfrominternational networksorinternationalfunding; (Level 1-B): Plans that were developedwithin international urbanclimate networks, such as the Covenant ofMayorsandtheCompactofMayors(e.g.SEAPs). Sectoral(Level 2): In absence of mitigation and adaptation plans/ strategies developed for the entire city, we checked for sectoral plans with a climate dimension, addressing single aspects of climate change in stand-alone documents, relating to particular sectors (energy, heat wave,flooding, etc.).Only sectoral planswithat leasta major section on'climate'or'climatechange'wereincludedinthiscategory. Related to Climate Change (Level 3): For cities lacking Level 1 and Level 2M/A plans, we looked at local plans that are relevant from a climateperspective(e.g.emergencyplans,disasterriskreductionplans, civil protection plans) but that do not explicitly focus or include a sectiononclimatechange.F. October 2016 and May 2017 referring to international databases (e.g. made available by the Covenant of Mayors and Compact of Mayors) and through common searchenginesusingkeywordsformitigationandadaptation,suchas: di Protezione Civile (Civil ProtectionPlan), Piano di Emergenza (EmergencyPlan),etc. In addition to that, websites of local governments, municipalities and/or other authorities were checked with a special focus on thosedepartments (e.g. planning, energy, sustainable development) that mightcoverclimateaction.Insomecases,themunicipalityorplanningdepartment were contacted with regard to the municipality's climate actionsandtorequesttherelateddocuments,ifnotavailableonline. The information gathered with this approach was organised in a shared database, taking into account for this study only the LCPs - nalizedandadoptedbythecitycouncilorauthority. 3.2. The city sample FortheItaliancitysample,wereferredtotheurbanareasincludedintheUrbanAudit(UA-2015)database(Eurostat,2015 ),whichaimsto providestatisticsonarangeofsocioeconomicaspectsrelatingtourban life in 885 cities spread across the EU Member States, Norway, Swit- zerland and Turkey. The Urban Audit delineates the \"core city\" ac- cording to political and administrative boundaries while the \"larger urban zone\" includes the core city and its commuter belt. The Urban Audit cities were selected in cooperation with the national Statistical Oces and are geographically dispersed to ensure a balanced and re- gionallyrepresentativesamplewhichtwiththeaimsofourresearch.

An analysis protocol and a set of indicators were dened as a common and transparent basis for the contentanalysisofplansineachoneoftheanalysedcities.In The for the 32 city sample Anin-depthcontentanalysisoftheavailableLCPswasconductedon the subsample of 32 cities. It was based on an analysis protocol con- sisting of a set of specic indicators populated by means of an inter- activeprocedurebasedononlineformsandsharedles. Inparticular,thecollecting-formofindicatorswasorganisedintwo sections,oneformitigationandoneforadaptation,eachofthemwitha common introductory section collecting general information on the availableplans,asreportedin Table2. The next two sections of the collecting-form were aimed at gath- ering comprehensive information on the latest adopted plans on miti- gation and adaptation. As concerns mitigation, the content analysisfocused mainly on the existence of a baseline emission inventory and future projections, CO 2/GHG emission reduction targets, mitigation topics included in plan and means and instruments to achieve them,actors involved, funding, communication aspects, monitoring and evaluation strategy and information on the local development frame- work. Similarly, for adaptation we looked at the impact/vulnerability inventory distinguishing among the dierent adaptation topics con- sidered and the related means/instruments foreseen for the plan's identied, commu- nicationstrategies,monitoringstrategiesandadditionalinformationon of LCPs wasfocusedonisreportedin TablesA.1andA.2 oftheAppendixA. 4. Results and discussion In the following paragraphs a general assessment of climate plan- ning in the 76 (UA-2015) Italian cities of the full sample will be pre- sented,followedbyadetailedcontentanalysisofthesmallersampleof 32(UA-3)Italiancities. 4.1. Availability of LCPs in 76 (UA-2015) Italian cities A comprehensive search of Local Climate Plans (LCPs) ocially adopted and published in 76 (UA-2015) Italian cities was carried out betweenOctober2016andApril2017inordertohaveafullpictureof how Italian cities are committed to reduce carbon emissions and pre- paredforachangingclimate.Theresultsarepresentedaccordingtothe analysisframeworkintroducedinthemethodologicalsection. 4.1.1. Comprehensive and stand-alone plans (level 1) The analysis of comprehensive and stand-alone LCPs started with the search of stand-alone documents that are mitigation and/or adap- tation plans developed autonomously by the urban authority/admin- istration. In Italy (Table 3), no city has an autonomous mitigation plan or a joint mitigation and adaptation plan whereas only 2 cities have a re- ferencedocumentonadaptation:Ancona( LocalAdaptationPlanofthe Municipality of Ancona, 2013 ) and Bologna ( Adaptation Plan of the Municipality of Bologna, 2014). It is worth underlining that both documentsweredevelopedintheframeworkofEULIFEprojects:LIFE \"act\"forAnconaandLIFE\"BLUEAP\"forBologna. The picture varies signicantly when we look at the planning documentsdevelopedonthebasisofthecommitmentassumedbycities within the Covenant of Mayors: the Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs) dene key actions that contribute to achieving the overall objectiveofreducingCO 2emissionsbyaminimumof20%bytheyear 2020,mainlythroughthepromotionofenergyeciencyandtheuseof renewableenergysourcesinalocalauthority'sterritory. Table4shows that 58 cities, that represent more than 76% of the UA sample, aremembersoftheCovenantofMayors(i.e.theyareatStep1-Signature), 96.6%ofthemhavedevelopedaSEAP(havingreachedStep2-Action Plan submitted), and 26.3% of them have On the other hand, none of these Italian cities have developed a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) more recently introducedbythenewCovenantofMayorsforClimateandEnergy.The SECAP is expected within two years following the date of the local council decision and aims at addressing both climate mitigation and adaptation targets by the year 2030 based on a Climate Risks and Vulnerability Assessment and a Baseline Emission Inventory. In parti- cular, \"the adaptation strategy can either be part of the SECAP or de- veloped and mainstreamed in a separate planning document\" (CovenantofMayorsforClimateandEnergy,2018 ). In addition, we analysed cities committed to the Compact of Mayors. In our sample ( Table 4), only 5 cities committed to the Com- pactofMayors(Roma,Milano,Bologna,Firenze,andPadova)butnone ofthemhavealreadydevelopedamitigationand/oradaptationplanin thisframework.Inotherterms,allofthese5citiesarestillattherst stepoftheadhesionpathsetupbytheCompactofMayors:1-Register commitment, 2 - Take inventory, 3 - Set reduction targets, 4 - Create eitherajointorindividualactionplantoaddressclimatemitigationand adaptation. Fig. 2shows how these comprehensive and stand-alone climate plans (Level 1) are distributed across Italy. Taking into account the geographicaldistribution ofour 76citysample(Northern -53%,Cen- tral-14%,Southern-33%)itisnotsurprisingthat57%oftheavailable SEAPs are concentrated in Northern Italy, followed by Southern Italy (30%)andCentralItaly(13%). On the other hand, cities without any climate plans are equally distributedbetweenNorthern(40%)andSouthernItaly(40%),whereas the remaining 20% of cities are located in the central regions (Lazio, Marche,ToscanaandUmbria). With regard to the distribution of Local Climate Plans included in our76citysampleinrelationtothecitysize, Fig.3pointsoutthatthe only 2 cities above 1,000,000 inhabitants (Roma and Milano), the 4cities between 500,000 and 1,000,000 inhabitants (Napoli, Torino, Palermo and Genova) and 1 city below 50,000 inhabitants (Campo- basso) have a Level 1-B plan (SEAP). On the other hand, looking at mediumcitiesitcanbeobservedthat: 100,000-500,000 inhabitants: 82% of these cities have a SEAP; moreover, the only 2 cities with an adaptation plan (Bologna and Ancona)havealsoaSEAP. 50,000-100,000inhabitants:57%ofthesecitieshaveaSEAP. 4.1.2. Municipal energy plans and emergency plans (level 2 and level 3) Asconcerns mitigation,onlyforthose citieswithoutacomprehen- sive plan (Level 1) we analysed the availability of sectoral mitigationplans and, in particular, of Municipal Energy Plans with a clear iden-ticationof areductiontarget forCO 2/GHG (Perugia, Brescia and Avellino) have an energy plan. These energy plans provide some baseline CO 2emission or emission reduction scenarios but do not set CO2orGHGemissionreductionstargets;thus,theywerenotconsidered as a sectoral mitigation plan for our analysis. As a result, the study identiesthatinthe76analysedcitiesMunicipalEnergyPlansdonot replace the lack of comprehensive mitigation plans. Whereas, munici- palities with more than 100,000 inhabitants have 24months of the entry into force of Decree n. 257/2016 (14/01/2017) for preparing their Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility which will allow to reduce atmospheric and acoustic pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and energyconsumption. In the case of adaptation, there are not sectoral plans for the 74 cities without a comprehensive plan. Thus, most aspects related to adaptation are covered by Municipal Emergency Plans, which are compulsorybytheCivilProtectionnationallaw(L.100/2012)andare availableinmostoftheanalysedcities.Onthis,theresearchshowsthat Municipal Emergency Plans are substituting the lack of sectoral adap- tation plans. However, they cannot substitute the adaptation plans because their rationale is dierent and somehow opposite: instead of focusing on prevent the unavoidable eects of climate change (proac- tive approach), their target is how to deal with emergency situations (post-eventaction). 4.2. Content analysis of LCPs in 32 (UA-3) Italian cities UsingthecollectingformreportedintheAppendix(TablesA.1 and A.2), an in-depth analysis of the content of mitigation and adaptation plans of the sample of 32 (UA-3) Italian cities was carried out in May smaller sample of 32 cities have already developed their Sustainable EnergyActionPlan(SEAP)intheframeworkofthisEuropeannetwork. None ofthe analysedcitieshave sectoral plans ofLevel 2suchas mu- nicipal energy plans including CO 2/GHG emission reduction targets, whereas the remaining 22% of cities have no kind of mitigation plan.Table 3 Level1-Aplansinthe76UA-2015citysampleforItaly.

In particular, all the analysed plans promote actions aimed at increasing energy performances in old municipal buildings, upgrading the muni- cipalfleetandpromotinglocalpublictransport,smartmobilitysystem, cycling, walking, car sharing/pooling, and electric cars. Moreover, an increaseofenergyproductionfromrenewablesources,mainlythroughthe implementation of PV, solar thermal and biomass, is promoted by 96%oftheanalysedplans.

Only a 12% of plans wereimplementedintheframeworkofEUprojects. 4.2.2. Adaptation As concerns adaptation, as already said, only Bologna and Ancona developedacomprehensivestand-aloneadaptationplan(Level1-A).In particular, the Ancona's adaptation plan was drafted within the Life project \"ACT - Adapting to Climate change in Time\" in 2013, whose Fig. by this are: landslides, coastal erosion, infrastructures, cultural heritage and heatwaves, paying particular attention on soft measures to raise citizens' awareness, like for example the establish- ment of a naturalistic laboratory. Likewise, Bologna developed its adaptation strategy in the framework of the Life project \"BLUE AP - BolognaLocalUrbanEnvironmentAdaptationPlanforaResilientCity\" in 2014. This strategy focuses on several vulnerabilities of the city (extreme rain events and hydrogeologic risk, heat waves, freshwater scarcity and droughts) introducing dierent proposals that will be realizedwithinastructuredactionplan. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 5, most of the analysed cities have developed a Level 3 plan namely \"Related to Climate Change plan\". In particular, 81% of the city sample (26 municipalities) has a Municipal Emergency Plan developed in compliance with the Civil Protectionnationallaw(L.100/2012)thatobligesallmunicipalitiesto implementaplandealingwithemergenciesduetonaturaldisasters.In particular,theseplansaimatassuringthesafetyofpopulation,focusing havenoplanatall.

Conclusions Today, the scientic community and many international networks recommend to tackle the challenge of cli- mate change at local level. First, because cities welcome most of the Europeanpopulationandsecondlybecauseseveralcitiesdirectlysuer negative eects of climate change such as landslides, floods, drought andheatwaves. In order to be ready to build climate-proof cities, municipalities have to engage themselves in reducing greenhouse gases, that are the main responsible of global warming, and creating climate resilient ci- ties.ThisstudyassessedhowItaliancitiesareengagedinsuchaclimate planning activity through the analysis of the status of local climate planning in a representative sample of Italian cities. This analysis can be useful to derive some general recommendations useful to improve boththeplansandthepolicyframeworkinwhichurbanclimateplans aredeveloped. Planning for mitigation and adaptation in Italy is being character- ized as a dynamic process, where the policy framework is quickly evolvingand more andmore cities areengaging inclimate actions.In particular, there is no national legislation that obliges cities to act interms of mitigation or adaptation. Thus the development and im- plementationofclimateplansisentrustedtolocalinitiatives. InthispaperwefoundthatmostItaliancitiespaygreatattentionto climate change, even if much more to mitigation than to adaptation, due to historical reasons and the long experience gained in energy planning. The engagement in mitigation is demonstrated by the large number of cities that have voluntarily joined the Covenant of Mayors initiative and that have developed mitigation plans carrying out dec- arbonization strategies: more than 73% of cities in 2/GHGtargetwasset.Regardingtheircommitment withintheCovenantofMayors,thecontentanalysisof32Italiancities,showedthatoverthe50%ofcitieshavesetaCO 2/GHGtargetsfor2020 side, only Bologna and Ancona in our sample approved their adaptation plan/strategy, respectively in 2014 and 2013. Few other cities have started the planning process to identify climate vulnerabilities. This may be attributable to the lack of a na- tionaladaptationframeworkuntil2014,whentheNationalAdaptationStrategywasapprovedwhereastheNationalActionPlanisstillmissing.

TheexploitationofEUfundingopportunitiescansupportwillingcities indevelopingplansandimplementingactions. The overall analysis of the policies and plans evaluated conrms a trend towards an increasing awareness on climate mitigation whereas thescarcityoflocaladaptationplansconrmsthaturbanresilienceisa very complex issue that Italian cities are addressing mainly with a sectoralreactiveapproachoncivilsecurity.Thus,whiletheyaddressa relevant number of interrelated elds, the study suggests that Italian cities should apply a more cross-sectoral and holistic approach in the development of their strategies in order to avoid maladaptation and exploit trade-os (synergies and opportunities) among mitigation and adaptationactions. Asamatteroffact,fortheItaliancontextintegrationofmitigation and adaptation actions in local planning systems can represent a pos- sible operative solution to maintain, in the long term, the expected results of local actions as well as to counteract carbon emission and reducing potential impacts of climate extreme events on cities. The scenario revealedby thisstudy suggestsalsothat cities needs thesup- port and coordination of upper levels of government, to undertake climateactioninamoresystematicway.Inthisregardthenewpolicy framework on adaptation that is being setting by the national govern- ment and some rst examples of regional climate change plans (e.g. Abruzzo Region) could represent a step forward provided that local action will receive the necessary attention in terms of policy con- struction and provision of the necessary technical and nancial re- sources. Becausecitizenshaveapotentiallyimportantroleinachievingthe set by the local climate plans, municipalities need to involve citizens, sectoral practitioners, stakeholders in all the implementation phasesoftheplans.Thus,acontinuouscommunicationandinformation flow has to be assured in order to achieve better informed population andgoodcooperationinreachinggoalsandcopewiththreatsofclimate change, designing and promoting an ad-hoc education and outreach campaignfocusedonbehaviourchangealsothroughonlineandsocial media campaigns. Several experiences carried out so far have demon- stratedhowimportantistotargetschoolstoreachhouseholds. Furthermore, the Italian case study shows that climate networks have represented a crucial role in initiating and supporting cities on mitigation and adaptation planning, and they continue to represent a relevantframeworktoconsolidatethistrendinthemediumterm.This is particularly true for the Covenant of Mayors which has boosted, in the latest years, Italian cities to start developing mitigation plans(SEAPs).Itishopedthatthisprocesswillbestrengthenedthroughthe new integrated Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy stimulating municipalities at joining it and boosting the implementation of in- tegrated mitigation and adaptation plans (i.e. the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans - SECAPs).

Current Opinion in Environment Cooperation of Turkmenistan in the Water Sector Jon Marco Church Abstract The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of cooperation of Turkmenistan with neighboring countries, donor countries, as well as international organizations, including nancial institutions. Its core is an analysis of the majordrivers of cooperation and an overview about the different types of interactions andrelations between Turkmenistan and its international partners. This is not anattempt to evaluate the quality or quantity of Turkmen initiatives or actions and no recommendation was produced. This is an effort to systematize information that is available to the public and to reflect on the experience of the author working inthe country and region on water issues.

One of the objectives of thatconference was to discuss the proposal to establish a Caspian Environment Counciland to create a Regional Center for Climate Change in Ashgabat. I do not know how far these initiatives went, but what I know for sure is that the meeting promoted positive cooperation for this book, particularly for this chapter. My presentation atthe conference focused more on cooperation between the United Nations EconomicCommission for Europe (UNECE) and Turkmenistan in the water sector. Thiscontribution will however go beyond this, starting from a short description of thesituation in the four major transboundary water bodies, followed by a brief histori-cal perusal of the last twenty years. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of cooperation of Turkmenistan with neighboring countries, donor countries, as well as international organizations,including nancial institutions. Its core will therefore be an analysis of the majordrivers of cooperation, what Peter Haas called \"influencing factors\" [ 1], together with an overview about the different types of interactions and relations betweenTurkmenistan and its international partners. It goes without saying that this is notan attempt to evaluate the quality or quantity of Turkmen initiatives or actions andthat no recommendation will be produced. This is an effort to systematize informa-tion that is available to the public. Moreover, this has nothing to do with the chapter dedicated to international cooperation in the Environmental Performance Review of Turkmenistan and its nal recommendations that have recently been adopted by theUNECE Committee on Environmental Policy [ 2]. Few scientic papers have been published specically on this topic in English [3-6], which is one of the reasons that persuaded me to accept the invitation of the editors of this book. So far, most scholarly research and development cooperation hasfocused on the regional scale, especially on the Aral Sea [ 7-10]. This is due to the relative difculty in obtaining rsthand information about the situation in the country, particularly about strategic issues such as this. The general feeling is however that the situation is improving and this text is a demonstration thereof. The sources used forthis analysis are, rst of all, ofcial documents and publications by the Turkmengovernment [ 11-14] and by international organizations [ 15-21], some of which are available online. Their interpretation relies heavily on the author's familiarity withthe issue and the country, having specialized in regional environmental cooperationand having served the UN in Turkmenistan.J.M. Church 842 Transboundary Waters As it can be observed from the map below, there are four transboundary water bodies in Turkmenistan, shared with a total of eight countries, based on hydrologi-cal boundaries: 1. Amu Darya-Sarygamysh Lake-Aral Sea basin (Afghanistan-Tajikistan- Uzbekistan-Kyrgyzstan-Kazakhstan) river basin 3. Tejen river basin (Afghanistan-Iran)4. Atrek-Caspian Sea basin (Azerbaijan-Iran-Kazakhstan-Russia) Source : UNECE (2011) Second assessment of transboundary rivers, lakes and groundwaters The Aral Sea basin is the largest catchment area in Central Asia and one of the largest closed water systems in the world [ 7-9]. Its main effluents are on one hand the Amu Darya, which is the most important river in Central Asia and flows from Afghanistan and Tajikistan to Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and on the other hand the Syr Darya, which flows from Kyrgyzstan to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, andInternational Cooperation of Turkmenistan in the Water Sector 85Kazakhstan. With regard to the Amu Darya, a small but signicant amount of water originates from Afghan territory, but its exploitation is currently very low because ofthe war and of the socioeconomic situation in the country. Most of the water is generated instead on Tajik territory, but the country uses only a small proportion of it. Hoping to achieve energy and food security, Tajikistan, which is the poorest amongformer Soviet republics and has recently experienced a civil war, is investing heavilyin the development of hydropower production and of irrigated land. This worriesUzbekistan, which apparently fears at the same time water scarcity and flooding dueto dam failure. This could have negative effects on its cotton elds and industry,which is particularly demanding of water. In Turkmenistan, the Karakum canalbrings water from the Amu Darya all the way to Ashgabat and beyond; the Altyn Asyr lake is being lled by drainage waters through the main drainage canal of the Golden Age that runs across the country from Turkmenabat and through the Karakumdesert; water is also brought to the depression in the northwestern part of the country,signicantly extending the river basin. In general, all downstream countries are greatly concerned by the overexploita- tion of water resources, which is causing the disappearance of the Aral Sea andwhich is having serious consequences for the livelihoods of millions of Kazakhsand Uzbeks. As the UN Secretary General put it after visiting the area in 2010: \"During my flight over the Aral Sea, from Uzbekistan, I was particularly shocked by what I saw. A sea that was once the fourth largest inland bodies of water in theworld has shrunk by nearly 90 percent [ ...]. Clearly, this is a collective problem requiring collective effort - not just from regional leaders, but the entire interna-tional community.\" 1All countries understand that international cooperation is needed to support efforts at the global, regional, national, and local scale to mitigatethe causes and to adapt to the consequences of the so-called \"tragedy\" of the AralSea. It must be noted, however, that the Aral Sea is not the only transboundary lake in the area. There is also the large and shallow Sarygamysh Lake, which nds itself in a depression between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and which consists mainlyof agriculture drainage waters originating from the Amu Darya. For this reason, itslevel and the quality of its water is also an issue of concern for the two countries. Given that drainage water for the Altyn Asyr lake originates from the Amu Darya, this contribution focuses mainly on this catchment area. In order to fullyunderstand the geopolitical situation, it is however fundamental to have a clearpicture of all transboundary waters of Turkmenistan, starting from the Murgab river basin. From the mountains of Afghanistan, the river extends itself to the Turkmen city of Mary, where it mixes with the Karakum canal and north of which it ends upin the desert. The Tejen represents another signicant transboundary river forTurkmenistan. It also originates from the reliefs of Afghanistan, flows westwardto Herat and northward along the border with Iran, dening it, before disappearingin the Karakum desert. In 2004, Iran and Turkmenistan inaugurated the Doosti dam, 1Quoted from his brieng to the Security Council of April 15, 2010, on the Secretary General's visit to Central Asia.J.M. Church 86also known as the Iran-Turkmenistan Friendship Dam, which nds itself on the Tejen river. Located on the border between the two countries and very close to theborder with Afghanistan, its reservoir plays an important role in stabilizing water supply to avoid social, economic, and environmental catastrophes such as the ten month drought of 2000. Through a pumped scheme, the reservoir also providesdrinking water to the distant city of Mashhad, which is the second largest city inIran. This greatly extends the scope and import of the Tejen river basin. Finally, the Atrek river flows from the Iranian to the Turkmen side west of the Kopet Dag mountains. With a changing riverbed, its waters are used mainly forirrigation and reach the Caspian Sea only in flood season. The latter is atransboundary water body itself, shared with Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, and Russia. It is of great importance for Turkmenistan because of its coastal and underwater oil and natural gas reserves, because of its influence on regional climateand environmental change, and because it is the natural habitat of a Turkmen stapleproduce such as sturgeon, from which caviar is derived. The government is alsoinvesting a lot in tourist infrastructure through the Avaza development project. Asin-depth analysis of this water body goes well beyond the economy of this chapter,the reader is invited to refer to other titles of this series by the same editors, forfurther information [ 22,23]. 3 Historical Perspective In order to fully understand the context, it is important to at least provide anoverview of the kinds of interactions experienced in the lifetime of individualsthat are now at senior positions of government structures. We all know that theSoviet period was characterized by massive investment in water infrastructure andambitious projects that greatly impacted nature, society, and the economy. Cooper-ation among Soviet republics was mediated and sometimes enforced by Moscowand it resulted in a system where - by greatly simplifying it - the downstream Kazakh, Turkmen, and Uzbek SSRs were providing oil and natural gas, in which they are rich, to the upstream Kyrgyz and Tajik SSRs in exchange for water.Research, surveying, and design were carried on mainly by the branch of the\"Hydroproject\" Institute in Tashkent, including the planning of dams and canals.This is perhaps the reason for the popular claim reported by Erika Weinthal that theUzbeks are the \"water people\" or vodniki of Central Asia [ 24,25]. A series of agreements was in place with Iran and Afghanistan to manage transboundary rivers. By the early 1980s, the situation of the Aral Sea was catastrophic. On top of that, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Iranian revolution of 1979 greatly contributed tothe destabilization of the whole region. The Soviet response to the situation was thelaunching of a large-scale planning effort to save the Aral Sea. In 1982, a WaterResources Master Plan for the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river basins adopted theprinciples of limiting water extraction per hectare of irrigated land and of sharingavailable water among the riparian SSRs. By the mid-1980s, detailed regulations wereInternational Cooperation of Turkmenistan in the Water Sector 87issued for the operationalization of these plans and two river basin organizations were created for the management of the Amu Da rya and the Syr Darya, respectively. According to most witnesses, in this period, the role of Central Asian SSRs, including the Turkmen SSR, was rather passive, as major decisions were taken in Moscow. In the early 1990s, the fall and dissolution of the Soviet Union created a vacuum. This meant the need to establish a new mechanism at least capable of mediating disputes among the newly independent states. This did not come from the Commu-nity of Independent States (CIS), but in the form of the Interstate Commission forWater Coordination (ICWC), which was created as a regional intergovernmentalarrangement, where all states of the region are equally represented. The two riverbasin organizations were restructured as joint companies and an ICWC Scientic Information Centre (ICWC SIC) was established in Tashkent to exploit synergies with the \"Hydroproject\" Institute. Over time, the ICWC SIC has become a keyresource for water information in Central Asia. The fall of the Soviet Union alsobrought along a shift from planning to programming. An International Fund forSaving the Aral Sea (IFAS) was established to nance projects to mitigate thecauses and to adapt to the consequences of the situation in the Aral Sea basin.Riparian and donor countries have pledged and invested hundreds of millions ofdollars through this mechanism. Without the mediating role of Moscow, some consistency was lost in transition, despite the best efforts at coordination by many partners. Moreover, the sudden absence of an authority capable of arbitratingproblems and enforcing solutions meant the emergence of disputes in the long term. For Turkmenistan as for most newly independent states, these were eventful years of hope and enthusiasm under the leadership of Saparmurat Niyazov, also known asTurkmenbashi. Few individuals knew how to run a fully independent country. Fewknew exactly what they were doing: on one hand, there was the tendency ofwelcoming all initiatives coming from abroad; on the other hand, path dependency from Soviet structures can be observed alongside the desire to renew everything, such as in the case of the Aral Sea. As it can be noticed comparing the list of participants tointernational meetings and the number of treaties signed and ratied since indepen-dence, Turkmenistan was participating actively in international processes until themid-1990s. The number of projects implemented with the assistance of donorcountries, international organizations, and nancial institutions was also quite high. It was not until the decision taken in 1995 to strictly adhere to permanent neutrality in its foreign policy that Turkmenistan started to progressively withdraw from the international scene, refusing to participate in international meetings and projects and, of course, to become member of new organizations or party to newconventions, with few exceptions [ 26]. There are many hypotheses about this empty chair policy: some believe, for instance, that it was a reaction to overexposure andnegative experiences in the early period, while others argue that it was an explicitforeign policy choice. The fact is that, for the following decade, Turkmenistaneffectively closed itself to international cooperation, even refusing developmentaid. The only exception was a general support to the United Nations because of its universality and neutrality. A signicant gesture was calling a national holiday after the Turkmen proverb \"a drop of water is a grain of gold,\" which is still celebratedJ.M. Church 88on the rst Sunday of April and is an opportunity to take stock of what the country does in the water sector. Another example is the Framework Convention for theProtection of the Environment and Sustainable Development in Central Asia, which was proposed in 2006 and which includes provisions for the management of transboundary waters. 2 Since late 2006, the arrival to power of Berdimuhamedov and his policy of reform and increasing openness brought along a new wave of hope for internationalcooperation. With regard to foreign policy, the reform process started fromimproved relations with neighboring countries, from Afghanistan, which receiveshumanitarian and development aid from Turkmenistan, and Iran to Kazakhstan andUzbekistan. This represents a welcome development for improved management of transboundary waters and has already been reflected in a more active stance in IFAS, which is the only true regional arrangement that is truly functioning atpresent time, as ICWC and other processes are captive of either the rivalry forleadership in the region between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan or the conflictinginterests of upstream and downstream countries. Ashgabat slightly distanced itself from Russia, considering that dependence on gas exports to Moscow was excessive, and carefully balanced its relations with all majorpowers, from the USA to the EU and from India to China, particularly through economic policy. The pursuit of positive neutrality is possible also because of the relative wealth of a country, which is considered me dium income by glo bal levels and which allows it to act as a donor more than a recipient country. In 2010, development aid to Turkmenistan accounted for only about 16 million USD, according to UNDP. Atthe multilateral level, Ashgabat increased its participation in United Nationsprojects and processes and relaunched relations with development banks. UnderBerdimuhamedov's leadership, it no w pursues the adoption of international standards. To do so, it has partnered with international institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the UNECE, which is a standard setting organization in elds ranging from water to the environment and from housing totransport, especially under the leadership of its former head Ja \u00b4nK u b i s . In this framework, Turkmenistan often volunteers to act as chair of multilateral processes and to host international conferences in the magnicent buildingscompleted over the last few years in Ashgabat. Moreover, because of its economicresources, it often proposes to host international centers, such as the new RegionalCenter for Climate Change mentioned above or the United Nations Regional Center for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, which was launched in 2007 and whose presence in Ashgabat is a reflection of the opening and neutrality of the country.Water and the environment is also one of the three priority areas of the center 3 [18,19]. While the country is still young and developing, it is too early to make a balance of foreign policy under Berdimuhamedov. 2See article 9. On November 26, 2006, the framework convention was signed only by Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. 3See its program of actions for 2009-2011 and, most recently, for 2012-2014.International Cooperation of Turkmenistan in the Water Sector 894 Main Issues After having looked briefly at transboundary water bodies and having provided a short historical overview, we will now analyze the three major drivers of cooperation in the water sector. These are regular supply of water from upstream countries, sharing waterwith neighboring countries, and sufcient supply of water to the Aral Sea. These are also the main issues for the Altyn Asyr lake and, more generally, the Amu Darya basin.Other issues such as climate change or risk management, which may be of great import at the global or regional scale, but that, for the geographical conguration of the country or for other contingencies are not currently at the very top of the agenda, will also be mentioned. It can be noted that main drivers are relatively short term, while the latter issues are more long term. This tension is frequent in all kinds of decisionmaking - not only in Turkmenistan - and is a major concern for the sustainability ofany given policy. Because of the sensitive nature of the rst set of issues, mostinternational partners have no choice but to work on questions that are currently notat the top of the government agenda, while they aspire to contribute to more criticalissues such as solving the problem of the Aral Sea. The regular supply of water from upstream countries is of great import for downstream countries such as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Of course, it alsoimportant that water is sufcient to meet the needs of downstream countries, butthis responsibility is shared by both upstream and downstream countries and will beconsidered from the perspective of the whole basin. The emphasis here is onregularity because, besides natural variability, such as seasons, there is alsohuman generated variability. This depends mostly on interventions upstream,such as the construction of a new dam or the operations of existing ones or thelaunching of large irrigation schemes. Of course, upstream countries can and have the right to do so and downstream countries can and have the right to be concerned about undesirable effects such as the extremes of draught and flooding. Withinternational agreements and judicial decisions, international law providesprinciples, instruments, and examples of how to solve these issues and internationalpartners are working closely with the governments of the region to achieve peacefulsolutions [ 15,27]. Particularly in the latter period, Turkmenistan has consistently highlighted the need to avoid confrontation, military and otherwise, which wouldbe detrimental to all. It has insisted on the importance of reaching a \"mutually benecial\" agreement for the \"rational use\" of water resources. Another key issue for Ashgabat is the sharing of water with neighbors. Turkmenistan is downstream with regard to Iran and Afghanistan and is both upstream (middle part of the Amu Darya) and downstream (lower and upper partof the same river) for Uzbekistan. Here, we mean active sharing alone, i.e., thewater flow that is left for downstream countries, given that passive sharing or thewater that is received from upstream, has been and, at the same time, will be dealtwith in the previous and following paragraph. For the Amu Darya basin, this is still regulated by the 1992 Almaty Agreement, which allocated 43% of the water drainage of the Amu Darya to Turkmenistan and which, by the way, also createdJ.M. Church 90the ICWC. Other issues, such as infrastructure maintenance, are regulated by a more specic agreement. Governments hold bilateral and sometimes multilateralmeetings on these topics and there is regular collaboration between operators on both sides, such as in the case of the Qarshi pumping stations shared by the two countries [ 21]. As the country is currently under the agreed share and given that exchange with Uzbekistan is generally positive, this would be no great issue, if itwas not that the country seems to be aware of the fact that, if current trends areconrmed, according to frequently quoted government sources, 4Turkmenistan risks running out of water by 2020. This is one of the reasons why, in recentyears, the government has been putting so much emphasis on saving water and,more generally, on the rational use of water. As it can be seen from the data below, this is especially pressing in the Amu Darya basin, also considering that the amount of water used by Uzbekistan is comparable. How much of the share agreed in 1992 of the Amu Darya is actuallyused by Turkmenistan? 5How much water of the Amu Daryais used by fornonirrigation purposes? 70% 2% 2010 79% 9% There is no need, however, to wait until 2020 to be concerned about water consumption in the whole Amu Darya basin. In Soviet times, ambitious projects and irrigation practices resulted in the excessive use of the river's water, whichcaused in turn water supply to the Aral Sea to become insufcient. Moreover, while the 1992 Almaty Agreement provides grounds for distributional justice among the ve Central Asian republics, it theoretically allows them to withdraw 100% of thewater of the Amu Darya, if you sum the share of each state. This leaves nothing forthe Aral Sea or, to put it differently, puts the responsibility solely in the hands ofriparian states and their capacity and good will to ensure that sufcient amounts ofwater end up in the Aral Sea, which is clearly not the case. In this regard,Turkmenistan is often criticized in international contexts for its large and liberalconsumption of water. Its majestic fountains are often cited as example, even if consumption for nonirrigation purposes is relatively small compared to the agricul- tural sector, including cotton, as it can be seen in the gures above. In order to solvethe issue of excessive water use, IFAS has been implementing large programsfunded by the countries of the region and by donors, frequently with the assistance 4This must be at the national scale. I am not aware of exactly how the projection was calculated. 5According to simple calculations of the author based on data produced by the Joint Company \"Amu Darya\" and published on the web portal CAWATERinfo. The total mean annual flow of all rivers in the Amu Darya basin is assumed to be constant and estimated at around 74.22 km3 (without the Zeravshan). 6Based on the same data as above. UNECE reports that the 1997 gures are actual water uses, while the 2010 gures are prospective water requirements [ 20].International Cooperation of Turkmenistan in the Water Sector 91of international organizations. However, there is no binding agreement and no way for the international community to force riparian countries to keep water use tosustainable levels and to manage the Amu Darya so to ensure that it receives sufcient amounts of water. The environmental pressure caused by the social and economic damage along the shores of the Aral Sea is serious, but seems, at thisstage, to be considered less important than the losses that would derive fromreducing water consumption in certain areas and for specic activities. This is aconscious and explicit political choice. There is, moreover, the fear that if a givencountry went ahead with large water saving plans, other countries would not do thesame, which would result in a comparative disadvantage for the virtuous country.This is a typical cooperation dilemma. This does not mean, however, that the perception and understanding of the situation or the actual situation might not change in the future and that countries could not nd the right incentives andpolitical will to limit water use to sustainable levels. Another important issue but one that has not reached the very top of the government's agenda yet is that of climate change. As one of the editors of thisvolume has pointed out in several occasions [ 28], Central Asia and Turkmenistan are among the parts of the world that have already experienced the highest increasesof temperature and that are expected to suffer the highest increases in the coming future, which is cause of particular concern given the relative scarcity of water, that most of the country is desert and that many settlements are located in mountainareas. Most international organizations and development partners are somehowinvolved in trying to bring the attention of the government on this issue. Theleadership of the country proved to be sensitive to the issue, launching highvisibility initiatives such as the already mentioned regional center. It is likely thatchanging climate will result in more extreme events such as draughts and floods,which are already cause of concern. Risk management needs not only sustainable land and water management but also early warning and alert systems that some- times need an international reach, such as in the case of most transboundary rivers.The governments of the region, which is prone to natural disasters such asearthquakes, are in regular contact on the matter and many international partnersare also involved strengthening the capacity of the governments to respond. Other issues of concern with an international dimension are environmental impact assessment of transboundary projects, such as dams and new irrigationschemes, prevention of and ghting against transboundary pollution, and transboundary effects of industrial accidents that can contaminate water. Access to environmental information, such as water quality in specic areas by the public,is another issue often raised by international partners. Nontraditional issues such aspayments for ecosystem services, such as water sanitation performed by certainecosystems, or more generally the so-called \"green economy\" discussed at recentinternational conferences, including ecotourism in wetlands, are relatively new.Another nontraditional approach to water management is including trade in agri-cultural products also in the water balance of countries. It is often said thatJ.M. Church 92exporting one tomato is like exporting four gallons of water. As far as I know, this approach is new to the region. Finally, technology exchange must also be men-tioned. Turkmenistan actively uses international conferences and scholarly exchanges to invite experts from the USA, Israel, as well as other countries, to introduce new technologies and innovative techniques in the country. 5 Formal and Informal Interactions International cooperation is not limited to formal interactions. An issue that is oftenoverlooked in the various analyses is the co-presence of different types ofinteractions. There is in fact a wide range of informal activities going from generalmonitoring to the daily running of irrigation schemes and the cleaning up ofriverbanks. These practical activities are usually performed at the level of operatorsand local governments. While there can be local rivalries and misunderstandings, inmost cases cooperation with the other side of the river seems to be regular andpositive, especially on environmental issues, cemented as it is by the sharing of common resources and by many years of living side by side. Many individuals working on two sides of the same border have studied together in Soviet institutesand have developed links of friendship. This seems to hold true with all neighboringcountries, from Uzbekistan to Afghanistan. These activities are usually performedbelow the radar of ofcialdom as there is no need to have formal meetings andexchanges. Of course, the ofcial level regularly monitors the situation andprovides inputs, ultimately exercising control, if needed. On the Amu Darya,government authorities are more vigilant toward the Afghan than the Uzbek border for obvious security reasons. Turkmenistan, however, distinguishes itself for its high level of formality both internally and externally. This is a reflection of its Soviet past and of the huge role that the public sector and government structures play in the national economy, aswell as perhaps a cultural trait. Level of formality is an important trait in Turkmendomestic and foreign policy and is often used as a way to prioritize, also in the watersector. Huge importance is given, for example, to high level foreign guests. Theirparticipation in ofcial celebrations, such as the national holiday \"a drop of water is a grain of gold,\" tends to have positive effects on relations between Turkmenistan and international partners, from donor countries to international organizations.Respect for elders and generous hospitality are traditional values in Turkmenistan,as well as in the greater region. There are many kinds of formal interactions andthey range for the most formal, such as agreements and commissions, to the lessformal, such as meetings and programs. The general trend is toward less formality,but there is still - and I have recently argued that there should be [ 29] - room for formal frameworks, including legal agreements and institutional structures. This is particularly true in the case of Turkmenistan also in the water sector.International Cooperation of Turkmenistan in the Water Sector 936 Bilateral and Multilateral Relations Two main types of relations can be identied in international cooperation. On one hand, there are bilateral relations between Turkmenistan and other countries indi-vidually. In the water sector, these countries can be classied in neighbors, donors,and others. On the other hand, there are multilateral relations at different scales:subregional, regional, and global. Multilateral relations often take place in theframework of international agreements or organizations. The following paragraphsare going to present the main bilateral and multilateral relations of Turkmenistanrelevant for the water sector. This will allow to complete an overview of the status of international cooperation of the country in this issue area. 6.1 Bilateral Relations The most important partner of Turkmenistan in the water sector is Uzbekistan, as the two countries share a signicant part of the Amu Darya. From the trinational bordershared also with Afghanistan, the river moves northwest well into Turkmen territory.It then denes the border with Uzbekistan north of Turkmenabat before fully enteringUzbek territory south of Urgench. As with all its neighbors, Ashgabat cultivatesfriendly relations with Tashkent. Meetings are frequent both at formal and informal levels. The countries jointly operate irrigation schemes such as the Qarshi pumping stations. These are regulated by the Agreement between Turkmenistan and theRepublic of Uzbekistan on Cooperation on Water Management Issues, signed inTurkmenabat on January 16, 1996. This agreement includes some provisions fordispute resolution and is still in force. Also, the joint management of the large andshallow Sarygamysh Lake should not be forgotten. Its level and the quality of itswater are of vital importance for the inhabitants of the surrounding area. While it istrue that the two countries have some basic interests in common due to their geographical position and share many positions, it is unfair to equate the foreign policy of the two countries as far as water is concerned. Turkmenistan is very carefulat maintaining its neutral stance and good neighborly relations, while Uzbekistangenerally favors a bilateral approach. For this reason, it is an exaggeration tocharacterize them as a downstream block against upstream countries. The second most important partner for water management is Afghanistan. Three important rivers originate from there: the Amu Darya, the Murgab, and the Tejen. Fordecades, relations have been complicated by the Soviet invasion, civil war, the Taliban regime, and the current war. In recent years, Turkmenistan has tried to foster good neighborly relations, also extending humanitarian assistance and developmentaid. In Soviet times, attempts were made to establish a shared water monitoringsystem, but war got in the way. In case of floods upstream, alert mechanisms fordownstream countries are weak. The situation makes it difcult to know exactly whathappens on the Afghan side and Turkmen experts are eager to learn more about it,J.M. Church 94especially considering the importance of transboundary rivers. Moreover, for security reasons, it is difcult for foreigners, including ofcial representatives of internationalorganizations, to obtain permission to visit and assess the situation on the border. Peace and prosperity in Afghanistan will denitely have consequences for water use and for downstream countries. The potential for collaboration between expertsand administrations of the two countries is great and neutral frameworks such asthe UN Special Programme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA), whereboth countries are full members and whose chairmanship is currently held byTurkmenistan, are ideally positioned to facilitate these contacts. The third most important partner is Iran. The two countries share two rivers: the Tejen and the Atrek. Only the latter originates in Iran. We have seen that the Tejen flows from Afghanistan, denes rst part of the Afghan-Iranian border and part of the Turkmen-Iranian border, where it feeds the Doosti dam, also known as theIran-Turkmenistan Friendship Dam. The management of the dam is regulated by anagreement signed in 2004, which is similar to the bilateral agreement withUzbekistan. With the exception of the Doosti dam, where a joint coordinationcommission was created, it must be noted that Turkmenistan has not establishedbilateral commission for the management of transboundary rivers, despite the factthat they are an instrument chosen by many countries and enshrined by several agreements and conventions [ 30]. The dam is of vital importance for the Iranian city of Mashhad, so trinational cooperation among Iran, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan is essential, considering that the Tejen river also flows through theAfghan city of Herat. The joint management of the Atrek river and the Caspian Seaare also important but are more distantly related to the focus of this book. Relationsbetween the two countries are friendly and meetings are regular. Another important country in the region is Tajikistan. With 80% of the Amu Darya's run-off originating from there, the country is a \"water superpower.\" 7Of course, any change in water use in Tajikistan has consequences for Uzbekistan andTurkmenistan and the Aral Sea. The rst and most immediate issue of concern is thepresence of adequate mechanisms to aler t downstream countries in case of flood upstream. A second issue is the potential consequences of the failure of existing orplanned hydropower plants for downstream co untries. A third issue is the integrated management of the river system, particularly with regard to nding a balance - andmechanisms to regulate it - between hydropower production, land irrigation, and cleanwater, on one hand, and guaranteeing that a suf cient amount of water ends up in the Aral Sea, on the other hand. For these reasons, relations between the two countries haveknown moments of tension in the past, but these have been much lower than the levelsexperienced with Uzbekistan on these issues. Turkmenistan tends to deal with thesituation through regional platforms such as IFAS, SPECA, and UNRCCA. Diplomatic relations between the two countries are normal. These instances will be discussed inmore detail below together with other multilateral processes. 7Calculation of the author based on data published by the IFAS Executive Committee.International Cooperation of Turkmenistan in the Water Sector 95Finally, relations with donor countries in the water sector, such as the USA and the European Union, are cordial, but conditioned by the double reluctance of donors to fund activities in a middle-income country and of Turkmenistan to receive nancial assistance it has not requested. There is a general agreement that the country needs technical assistance and capacity building, as many experts left thecountry after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This is a kind of assistance thatdonors are normally happy to provide, as it allows them to give a competitive edgeto their own experts, particularly in the case of Germany, France, and otherEuropean countries. Turkmenistan generally welcomes such assistance, such as inthe case of the TACIS program, as long as it remains technical assistance and doesnot come with a hidden agenda. Spontaneously or as a result of technical assistance, Turkmenistan also collaborates with research institutes or individual experts from Russia, Israel, the USA, as well as other parts of the world, particularly for theimplementation of its water projects. International conferences organized inTurkmenistan are usually the occasion to foster these collaborations. 6.2 Multilateral Relations Moving to multilateral relations, there are at least three distinctions to be made:rst, between formal and informal groupings of countries; second, based on sectoror functions; and third, according to scale. With regard to the rst distinction, we will focus on formal processes. As we have already discussed above, Turkmenistan keeps a neutral stance and tends to favor formal interactions. Concerning thedistinction among the various sectors, the most important difference is betweendevelopment banks and other international organizations Turkmenistan is memberof. In fact, while countries usually nd themselves in a position where they requestthe assistance of development banks, such as the World Bank, the Asian Develop-ment Bank (ADB), and the EBRD, to nance various initiatives, the relationshipwith other international organizations is normally the opposite. Organizations such as the United Nations often make proposals, but they rarely have resources them- selves. They need to partner with donor countries to obtain these resources and theyneed to obtain the agreement of recipient countries to implement projects. This putscountries such as Turkmenistan decidedly in the driver's seat. Now, the relativewealth of the country puts it in a position where its need for funding fromdevelopment banks in the water sector is limited, so this distinction is also notfully relevant to our case. Therefore, we chose scale as the main organizingprinciple for the concluding paragraphs, distinguishing between the subregional (Central Asia) and regional (Europe or Asia) scale, on the hand, and the global scale, on the other hand. We will see that the position and relative weight ofTurkmenistan with regard to other countries at the different scales makes a signi-cant difference for its attitude toward various platforms. At the subregional scale, the three main platforms are ICWC-ICSD-IFAS and UNRCCA. As it has already been mentioned above, ICWC was created in 1992 toJ.M. Church 96act as secretariat for the Almaty Agreement. Turkmenistan played an important role for its creation in the early 1990s. Under the ICWC, there is also an InterstateCommission for Sustainable Development (ICSD), which takes care of more specically environmental issues, with a good degree of success. The environment is the most advanced sector in terms of subregional cooperation and Turkmenistanplayed an important role for the creation of this body as well. A SIC was establishedunder the ICWC in Tashkent and acts as the main source of information for thewater sector in Central Asia. There is a branch of the SIC in each member state,including Turkmenistan, and Turkmen authorities regularly share relevant informa-tion with the SIC. Turkmenistan strives to maintain positive working relations withall members of the ICWC, the ICSD, and the SIC. The greatest efforts are made, however, with regard to IFAS, which is arguably the only fully functioning auton- omous subregional arrangement in Central Asia. Like the ve other member states, Turkmenistan also has a permanent represen- tative in the IFAS Executive Committee, whose headquarters change on a rotatingbasis. This makes sure that the interests of all countries are taken into consideration.This is one of the advantages of IFAS, which resulted in the approval of the AralSea Basin Program (ASBP), which has already reached its third cycle. Supported bydonors, the ASBP is basically a project container that is the result of a careful balance between the position of both upstream and downstream countries as requested by the presidential summit of 2009. There are in fact projects to supportadaptation to the consequences of environmental change along the shores of theAral Sea, as well as projects to promote mitigation of its causes in all ripariancountries. To be fully adopted, the ASBP needs however to be approved at thenational level by all member states. At the time of writing, Turkmenistan is about tojoin Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, who have already approved it. It is hoped thatthe fact that no upstream country has approved it yet is not a sign of politicization of the program, which is mutually benecial and quite neutral, which is in turn one of the prerequisites of Turkmenistan to support it. It is worth noticing that asignicant part of the funding for the ASBP will come from Central Asian republicsthemselves, particularly for projects at the national level. Donor support wasrequested for regional initiatives, particularly from Germany and ADB. Another relevant platform is represented by the UNRCCA, considering that water and the environment is one of its three priority areas. Mission created in2007 through the UN Secretary Council, the UNRCCA constantly engages in political dialogue with all Central Asian republics to prevent conflict, also in the water sector. 8This comes in the form of good ofces of the UN Secretary General, who visited the region in 2009, and of his special representative, Miroslav Jenc a, whose ofce is hosted in Ashgabat. This comes also in the form of regularconsultations at the highest political level, of meetings, seminars, and trainings onthe general situation, but more frequently on specic issues such as the joint 8See the letter dated May 7, 2007, from the Secretary General to the President of the Security Council (S/2007/279).International Cooperation of Turkmenistan in the Water Sector 97management of transboundary waters. The UNRCCA currently manages a project sponsored by the government of the USA to promote dialogue and a mutuallybenecial agreement on water resources management. In this manner, it supports the work of IFAS and it builds capacity about international law, mediation of potential disputes on transboundary waters, and for the creation of an early warningmechanism for transboundary water issues, with the support also of France. Theidea of such a center in Central Asia has been in the air for several years, butthe offer of Turkmenistan to host it in Ashgabat once again proved fundamental forthe actual opening of the center. At the regional level, important frameworks of reference for water issues are the two UN Regional Commissions, the UNECE, which is based in Geneva, and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacic (ESCAP), which is based in Bangkok. Together they manage and service SPECA. All Central Asian republicsare at the same time members of both regional commissions, which are essentiallystandard setting organizations also in the water and environment sectors. The generalneutrality of the United Nations and the technical nature but political leadership of theregional commissions - the Executive Secretary is traditionally a former minister offoreign affairs and an Under-Secretary General (USG) - makes them ideal platformsto advance cooperation in the water sector in the region. The last UNECE \"Environ- ment for Europe\" Ministerial Conference, held in Astana in 2011, focused on water and the green economy and provided an opportunity for the countries of the region todiscuss issues of common interest and to prepare for Rio + 20. It must be noted, that the UNECE, in particular, has developed and services the 1992 Water Convention, which enshrines most generally accepted principles for themanagement of transboundary waters. In the framework of the EU WaterInitiative's (EUWI) National Policy Dialogue (NPD) on Integrated WaterResources Management (IWRM), the UNECE is supporting the government of Turkmenistan in the accession process, which is expected to take place shortly. In particular, the UNECE is supporting a working group of national experts that areassisting the government in the preparation of the technical documents and draftlegislation needed for accession. The EU has partnered with the UNECE to supportthe NPDs in Central Asia. The 2002 EU Water Framework Directive and the 1992UNECE Water Convention are the two main frameworks of reference. With severalnon-UNECE member states that expressed interest in joining the convention,including Iran and Afghanistan, it must be noted that the 1992 Water Convention, on the hand, is evolving from a regional to a global convention, on the other hand, was caught in the dispute between upstream and downstream countries andpoliticized, even if the letter of the convention merely reflects general principlesthat are commonly accepted in many other subregions. 9Some countries proposed to develop a water convention specic to Central Asia. Turkmenistan itself had 9The 1997 New York Convention, which was developed by the International Law Commission of the UN General Assembly and was supposed to be the global convention, has not managed to enter into force yet because of some controversial provisions.J.M. Church 98presented the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Environment and Sustainable Development in Central Asia in 2006, but these approaches have notgathered consensus from all interested countries yet. Other frameworks active in the water sector at the regional level are a develop- ment bank such as the Islamic Development Bank (ISDB) and an internationalorganization such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE). While the former is providing loans for rural water supply infrastructure,the latter is implementing small projects focusing on capacity building for thesustainable management of land and water to ght against soil degradation. On theside of development banks, the absence of the EBRD and the ADB from the watersector is signicant if compared to other countries in the region. Again, the availabil- ity of nancial resources for water projects gives Turkmenistan a high degree of autonomy in this regard. A specic feature of these regional arrangements is that theyare sometimes dominated or have a strong imprinting from a large country or groupof states in the broader region. While this is not necessarily a problem, this may clashwith the strict neutrality of Turkmenistan. The OSCE, for instance, is perceived to bedominated by Western European countries and their values, the ADB by China, theEBRD by the United Kingdom, the ISDB by Saudi Arabia, etc. Finally, we move to the global level, where somehow Turkmenistan, because of its foreign policy, feels more comfortable, particularly in the framework of theUnited Nations. Because of their neutral platform, the United Nations are in aposition to collaborate with Turkmenistan much more closely than other interna-tional partners. However, water being a territorial resource, global initiatives in thewater sector are struggling. We already saw how a regional agreement, such as the1992 Water Convention, is de facto becoming a global standard. It is interesting tosee how Target C to \"halve, by 2015, the proportion of the population withoutsustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation\" of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7 to \"ensure environmental sustainability\" is generally being pursued at the national scale. There are traces of this in the United NationsDevelopment Assistance Framework (UNDAF) negotiated between the UnitedNations and the government, but there are no projects currently being implementedspecically about water supply and sanitation, as far as I know. The United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP), which is the only international organizationpresent in Turkmenistan capable of implementing large projects, has insteadobtained funding from the new Adaptation Fund to implement a two million dollar project to address climate change risks to farming systems at national and commu- nity level, with particular attention to the water sector. Concretely, this means thatsome analysis, support to the revision of the Water Code (in collaboration with theUNECE), and plenty of activities at the farmer, communal, and water users associ-ation level will be implemented. Again, while the government focuses on corefunctions such as water supply and sanitation, international partners try to promoteforward looking issues such as climate adaptation. This resonates well with thegovernment, which we saw promoting high visibility initiatives, such as that of launching a Regional Center for Climate Change in Ashgabat. Often, these interna- tional initiatives in the environment sector are also supported by UNDP, which isInternational Cooperation of Turkmenistan in the Water Sector 99implementing projects to prepare the countries of Central Asia, including Turkmenistan, for their participation in large international conferences such asRio + 20. A peculiar case is that of the World Bank. In the late 1990s, it had approved a thirty million dollar project to improve water supply and sanitation in the northernregion of Dashoguz in the framework of the ASBP. In the early 2000s, it had alsoperformed a study on integrated water resource management at the subbasin level,where the need is particularly acute because of the presence of the SarygamyshLake and the proximity of the Aral Sea. Besides national and local authorities, someof these activities were implemented in collaboration with the United NationsChildren's Fund (UNICEF). For reasons that are described in the nal report of the project, which is published online on the bank's website [ 31], the project was not completed and its implementation was considered unsatisfactory, I assume by both the bank and the government. This was followed by a long period when thebank did not grant any loan to the country, which coincided with the closing up ofthe country until the mid-2000s. In recent years, relations with Turkmenistan havenormalized and the World Bank is once again making investments. As far as Iknow, no loan has been granted in the water sector yet, but this may come in thefuture. In the framework of the NPD, the Ministry of Water Economy has recently expressed some interest in launching a pilot project of integrated water resource management at the subbasin level in the Dashoguz region, which may be anopportunity to build upon the work of the World Bank in the early 2000s. Finally, we must not forget more traditionally environmental initiatives in the water sector such as the sites designated under the 1971 Wetlands Convention andthe UNESCO Biosphere Reserves. These are purely scientic initiatives, wherecooperation is relatively easier and which receive strong support from the govern-ment. In the case of the former, Turkmenistan rejoined the convention, which focuses on the protection of wetlands and of the migratory birds that inhabit them, in 2009 (its territory had been under the convention until the fall of theSoviet Union). The only Ramsar site in Turkmenistan is the Hazar State NatureReserve on the Caspian Sea coast south of Turkmenbashi. The site is beingsupported by the UNDP with generous funding from the Global EnvironmentFacility (GEF). Together with four other natural sites, including the Amu DaryaState Nature Reserve, the site is now also on the national tentative list ofTurkmenistan to enter the UNESCO World Heritage List. No natural property is currently located in Turkmenistan. The inscription of a site on the list would be not only a great recognition for Turkmen heritage but would also be an excellentmanner to ensure continuous monitoring of the protection and sustainability ofthese sites, also in terms of tourism development. Another site on the nationaltentative list, the Repetek Biosphere State Reserve, is also a UNESCO BiosphereReserve, the only one in the country. This is another tool to ensure continuousmonitoring of sights, as well as a way to transform them in living labs to improveour understanding of coupled human-environment systems [ 32,33]. To conclude our overview of bilateral and multilateral relations of Turkmenistan, it is important to mention a peculiar platform, the EnvironmentJ.M. Church 100and Security Initiative (ENVSEC), which brings together six global and regional partners - the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), UNDP, UNECE,OSCE, the Regional Environmental Center (REC), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) - to ght against environmental threats to reduce the risk of conflict. Interagency coordination is well known to be an arduous exercise, but thisone has been more successful than others. Moreover, because of its many water andenvironmental issues, Central Asia is certainly one of the key areas for thisinitiative, which has recently produced an analysis of the situation in the AmuDarya River Basin [ 21]. Of course, this quick perusal does not include all aspects and certainly some international partners and cooperation activities of Turkmenistan in the water sector have not found their place here. The objective of this chapter was to describe, to provide a conceptual framework to analyze the situation, and to highlight majorelements, so the reader can understand the overall picture and possess the elementsto deepen specic issues. Even if there is no intention to evaluate the foreign policyof Turkmenistan in the water sector, the picture emerging from this analysis is thatof a country principled in its relations, selective about its partners, in good termswith its neighbors, with a solid, balanced, and expanding network of internationalconnections. In this manner, Turkmenistan is contributing to developing institutions capable of managing transboundary waters in times of increasing environmental pressure. References 1.

Church 102Soft Power of Tajikistan on the Water Agenda: Cross-Scale Dynamics Jon Marco Church Contents 1 Tajikistan and Its Water Resources 2 The Hydro-Energy Complex at the Regional Level 3 The Attributes of the Soft Power of Tajikistan on the Water Agenda 4 An Assessment of 15 Years of Initiatives and the New Water DecadeReferences Abstract Freshwater is among the major resources of Tajikistan. With the major- ity of the surface water originating from its territory, the country represents a water tower for the Amu Darya and consequently for the Aral Sea. Per inhabitant,Tajikistan uses much less of the water resources used in other riparian countriesand has a signicant hydropower potential. To fully develop it, Tajikistan follows asophisticated strategy that includes the construction of the Rogun dam and that isarticulated on several levels: from the citizen level to the national level with a national water sector reform and to the international level with many bilateral, regional, and global initiatives. Tajikistan has become one of the leading countrieson water cooperation at the global level and places the United Nations at the centerof global water governance. The soft power of Tajikistan on the water agenda canbe broken down in several attributes: the international context with a fragmentedglobal water governance; the leadership provided at the highest levels of the stateand the stability of power structures; the expertise and capacity built in the country;the support of many countries, international organizations, and international nan- cial institutions; as well as the traditional hospitality of the Tajik people. This all contributes to the so-called Dushanbe Spirit. With its water initiatives and byhosting conferences in Dushanbe, Tajikistan provides a public good to the interna-tional community. The latest initiative to date led to the declaration by the UNGeneral Assembly of the International Decade for Action \"Water for SustainableDevelopment\" (2018-2028). J.M.

The greatest resource of Tajikistan is its people.Consequently, many Tajiks work abroad, particularly in the Russian Federation.According to World Bank data, Tajikistan is the country in the world that depends the most from remittances. They represented 47% of GDP in 2011. 2The long crisis of the Russian economy is having a considerable impact on Tajikistan. Another resource of the country is freshwater. According to ofcial data, with 64 km3, Tajikistan ranks rst among the ve former Soviet republics of Central Asia for its water resources, well ahead of Kyrgyzstan. This corresponds to about 7,649 m3per inhabitant, which is well above the 1,700 m3that is normally considered as sufcient [ 1]. At least since Soviet times, Tajikistan is represented as a land rich in water, also in ofcial speeches and in school textbooks. It is a mountain country, and its water is naturally clean. Sarez, a lake located at 3,255 m above sea level (Fig. 2), symbolizes this feature with its crystal clear water. Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, was known in the Soviet period for the qualityof its drinking water. The Tajik people are proud of their water. At the national level, the main user of water is the agricultural sector, including aquaculture, with 94% of the resources available, followed by industry and thehydropower sector, with 3.5%, and by drinking water supply and sanitation with2.5%. 3Even if only 7% of the surface is cultivated, agriculture is important for the country, as it represents 25% of the GDP and employs 46% of the workforce, with73% of the population living in rural areas. 4Irrigation and drainage of agricultural land are therefore key issues for Tajikistan. Nevertheless, since Soviet times, the country is mainly known for its potential for the production of hydropower, which is estimated at 527 TWh/year. For the sakeof comparison, this is of the order of magnitude of the electric consumption of acountry the size of Germany. 5To this day, the installed capacity is of 5,190 MW and generates 94% of the electricity produced in the country.6With its 3,000 MW, 1See the data of the World Bank and of the IMF for 2013. 2World Bank, Development Prospects Group, Migration and Remittances Unit (2013), \"Migration and Development Brief,\" n. 20. 3Data for land and water resources of Tajikistan for 2010. 4See the data of the CIA World Factbook, consulted on 17 September 2016. 5Compare the data of the International Hydropower Association and those of the International Energy Agency for 2016. 6Data of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan.J.M.

However, every year, the reservoir of Nurek loses capacity especially because of siltation and, in this regard, would need major maintenance work to be undertaken. For this reason and to match an increasing demand for electricity, the govern- ment of Tajikistan chose to continue its ambitious policy and exploit its hydropower potential, because it is a clean and renewable energy, which is also very competitivefrom the perspective of costs. During the last decade, this resulted in the construc-tion of a large number of small hydropower plants and in the reactivation of somelarge projects that remained frozen since the end of the Soviet period, particularlythe Rogun dam, which would become the highest dam in the world [ 3,4]. With an installed capacity of 3,600 MW, this dam and its hydropower plant would allow notonly to exceed by far the demand but also to reduce the dependency of the countryfrom Nurek. At the same time, the production and consumption of electricity are character- ized by high seasonality. In winter, the electricity produced by hydropower plants islimited because of the need to ll the reservoirs, while the demand for electricity ishighest because of the cold weather; on the other hand, the reservoirs of thehydropower plants empty during the summer, which results in a production surplus. The exploitation of this electricity is among the priorities of the government. For this reason, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan developed the CASA project to export morethan 1,000 MW of electricity to Pakistan and Afghanistan during the summerperiod [ 5]. 7The development of the hydropower sector of Tajikistan and Kyrgyz- stan and the export of electricity are two components of the same long-term strategythat is a priority for both countries. 2 The Hydro-Energy Complex at the Regional Level Tajikistan is located at the same time upstream and downstream of two largetransboundary river basins, i.e., the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya [ 6,7]. With 80% of the volume originating from its territory, Tajikistan represents a water towerfor the Amu Darya. 8The Amu Darya basin is shared with Afghanistan, whose Pyanj tributary marks almost the whole border with Tajikistan; with Kyrgyzstan, for a small part of the Vakhsh tributary; with Turkmenistan; as well as with Uzbekistan [ 8]. On the other hand, the Syr Darya basin is shared with Kyrgyzstan, where 73% of the volume comes from; with Uzbekistan, which nds itself at thesame time upstream and downstream from the Tajik province of Sughd; as well aswith Kazakhstan. 7See also the nal declarations of the last two editions of the Regional Economic Cooperation Conference for Afghanistan (RECCA), held in Dushanbe in 2012 and Kabul in 2015. 8Data of the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources of Tajikistan for 2016.J.M. Church 106As shown in the map above (Fig. 1), all the water feeding into the Aral Sea or what is left of it originates from these two rivers. The Aral Sea represents one of the most serious environmental disasters of all times: 90% of the surface of what once was the fourth largest continental water body in the world disappeared with grave consequences for millions of Kazakhs and Uzbeks surrounding it [ 9-12]. The Amu Darya contributes 68% of the water of the Aral Sea. Therefore, Tajikistan bears aspecial responsibility for water supply in the basin, given that 55% of the water ofthe Aral Sea originates from its territory. Tajikistan uses about 12% of the resources of the Amu Darya, which corre- sponds to about 1,880 m 3per inhabitant.9This is about half of the approximately 3,487 m3of resource per inhabitant theoretically available in the Amu Darya basin. This gure is well above the 1,700 m3per inhabitant that would be sufcient, which explains why the Amu Darya basin, contrary to the Syr Darya basin, is usually notconsidered as not experiencing water stress, at least theoretically [ 13]. How to explain the tragedy of the Aral Sea? The initial fault comes from the Soviet period.The relative abundance of water in the region led to excessive water transfers,marked in red on the map above, to the persistence of obsolete irrigation techniques,and to the development of crops that need great amounts of water, such as cotton.This is a typical example of exceeding a threshold and of resource collapse. In Soviet times, the ve republics were part of the same hydro-energy complex. During summer, upstream countries provided water for the irrigation of eldsbelow; in exchange, downstream countries provided fuel during winter. For thisreason, several reservoirs were built in the region. They were used both for cropirrigation and to produce hydropower, which was also used to pump water fromaquifers and for mountain agriculture. Moreover, the ve republics were part of thesame electric grid, which allowed them to use the surplus electricity producedduring the summer [ 2]. It must be highlighted that Afghanistan, where about 14% of the water of the Amu Darya comes from, never was part of this system. On top ofthat, cooperation is complicated because of four decades of almost uninterruptedconflict that started with the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the ve republics of Central Asia initially tried to maintain the system in place [ 14-16]. In 1982, Moscow had in fact developed a master plan for water resources in the Amu Daria and Syr Daria basins to regulatethe hydro-energy complex of the region and to solve the problem of the Aral Sea. Inparticular, the master plan limited water extraction per hectare of irrigated land and shared the resource in the form of a percentage of the available volume for each one of the ve republics. These values were set for the last time in 1987. In 1992, the Almaty Agreement among the ve countries gave continuity to the existing rules and created the Interstate Commission for Water Cooperation(ICWC) to manage the shared resource and particularly to decide the water alloca-tion. Several regional institutions were therefore created, such as the Scientic 9Calculations of the author based on data for 2010 of the Basin Water Organization \"Amu Darya,\" published on CA Water Info.Soft Power of Tajikistan on the Water Agenda: Cross-Scale Dynamics 107Information Center of ICWC (SIC ICWC) and the International Fund for saving the Aral Sea (IFAS). However, the situation of the Aral Sea remains desperate and theregional context has evolved signicantly [ 17,18]. A civil war stroke Tajikistan between 1992 and 1997, which weakened the country and had repercussions in the relations with Uzbekistan, which remainedtense for many years, but are now improving. The management of the hydro-energycomplex and, particularly, the water-fuel exchange between these two countries hasgreatly suffered from this situation. Tajikistan experienced in several occasions theclosing of borders with Uzbekistan and the blocking of fuel deliveries, as well asother goods, provoking energy shortages especially in winter, while Uzbekistan isafraid that Tajikistan does not release sufcient amounts of water to irrigate during the vegetation period or, conversely, that it provokes floods downstream [ 2,19]. For these reasons, Uzbekistan has been opposing for many years the Rogun dam project [ 20]. This large infrastructure was conceived in Soviet times by the HydroProject Institute in Tashkent both to produce more hydropower and to better manage irrigation. Nowadays, Uzbekistan fears that the Rogun reservoir is lled toorapidly, provoking water shortage downstream. According to Kai Wegerich,Uzbekistan behaves therefore as a hydro-hegemon in the region and does every-thing it can to impose its national interests and hinder Tajikistan from fully developing its hydropower potential [ 21,22]. On the other hand, Tajikistan must take into consideration the position of Uzbekistan to reestablish the conditions of trust necessary to continue investing in the development of the hydropower sector. The strategy that it follows issophisticated and articulated on several levels. At the citizen level, the governmenttirelessly emphasizes the importance of water for the development of the countryand particularly of Rogun [ 3]. In 2010, the government went as far as encouraging citizens to invest part of their savings in the construction of the dam as a manifes- tation of patriotism. Additionally, more than 15 years ago, Tajikistan launched a water sector reform process at the national level, following the principles of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) [ 23], which is still ongoing. This ambitious process is supported by many partners, starting from the European Union, whose WaterFramework Directive inspires the reform, but also Germany, Switzerland, theUnited States, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, among others[24]. This reform contributes to signal the commitment of Tajikistan toward an approach to water management that, far from limiting itself to energy policy and tothe national level, also includes other sectors, starting from agriculture and drinkingwater supply and sanitation, as well as a transboundary dimension, with an intensecooperation with neighboring countries, including Afghanistan [ 25]. Concerning bilateral relations with Uzbekistan, the government of Tajikistan keeps inviting Uzbekistan to develop a management system that is mutuallybenecial. For instance, it proposed to reestablish the water-fuel exchange on themodel of the system that was in place in the Soviet period. Uzbekistan is even regularly invited to participate in the construction of Rogun, in its nancing, and in benet sharing, like Tajikistan already does with the Russian Federation and withJ.M. Church 108the Islamic Republic of Iran for the Sangtuda 1 and 2 dams, respectively. Tajikistan has even accepted to submit the Rogun project to a social, economic, and environ-mental impact evaluation by an independent body, as requested by Uzbekistan. The evaluation was carried on by the World Bank and was favorable to the project, considering that it is overall better than its alternatives. Then, at the regional level, Tajikistan actively participates in the activities of many institutions created after it gained independence, starting from the ICWC andespecially IFAS. Of course, there are disagreements among countries, for example,on data and information sharing and use, but Tajikistan remains rmly committedto these processes. The only major exception is the 1992 UNECE Convention onthe Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Helsinki Convention), which was politicized and transformed into a contentious issue between downstream countries, which ratied it, and upstream countries,which refuse to ratify it [ 26-28]. This is surprising, because the Helsinki Conven- tion was ratied by almost all countries in Europe and former Soviet republics,regardless of their upstream or downstream position. Finally, at the global level, Tajikistan has become one of the leading countries on water cooperation. Since 2000, it launched several initiatives and hosted inDushanbe a great number of events (Table 1). Some authors focus their attention only on the use of these initiatives to establish a favorable context for the develop-ment of the hydropower sector [ 29]. If this is clearly a manifestation of soft power, i.e., the capacity to coopt partners more than to force them, the remainder of thischapter will be dedicated to breaking down the attributes of the soft power ofTajikistan on the water agenda and explaining the different factors that made itpossible for this small country to become leader on water. This will allow toappreciate the many elements that, well beyond the hydropower ambitions of thecountry, allow Tajikistan to lead on this issue. The following paragraph, as well as the rest of the chapter, is mainly based on direct observation by the author, who acted as consultant of the Government of Tajikistan on the water sector reformprocess at the national level for UNECE between 2011 and 2013 and on the lastthree global water conferences held in Dushanbe for UNDP in 2013, 2015, and2016 (Table 2).

If it was not favorable, these initiatives would not have thelevel of interest that they have been raising for more than 15 years. As it can beobserved from the table below, the architecture of global water governance isextremely fragmented (Table 3). 10Countries such as Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, or Hungary support different processes. These initiatives some-times compete against each other. For this reason, many of these countries haverecently called for a new global water architecture. A High Level Panel on 2030 Global Water Architecture was convened by Switzerland, France, Hungary, and the Netherlands during the 2016 World Water Week in Stockholm and introduced by ahigh-level government representative from Germany. The action of Tajikistan puts the UN at the center of global water governance. Most member states support this approach. Thirty-nine countries, including Uzbek-istan, have even joined the Group of Friends of Water at the UN General Assembly,created by the Permanent Mission of Tajikistan in New York. The UN is anorganizational platform that is inclusive and representative of the diversity of the countries of the world, including least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), such as 10See the nal report of the UN Secretary General' s Advisory Council on Water and Sanitation (UNSGAB).Table 2 Global water conferences in Dushanbe since 2003 Year Title Co-organizer 2003 International Fresh Water Forum UN 2005 International Conference on Regional Cooperation in Transboundary River BasinsInternational Network of Basin Organizations 2008 International Conference on Water Related Disaster ReductionUN 2010 High Level International Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the International Decade for Action \"Water for Life\"UN 2011 Towards the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20): Water Cooperation IssuesUN 2013 High Level International Conference on Water CooperationUN 2015 High Level International Conference on the implementa- tion of the International Decade for Action \"Water for Life\"UN 2016 High Level Symposium on SDG 6 and Targets: Ensuring that No One Is Left Behind in Access to Water and SanitationUNDESAJ.M. Church 110Tajikistan. For these countries, water is extremely important. Recent analyses by UNDP demonstrate that access to water and sanitation influence 78% of thestatistical variance in the Human Development Index (HDI) across the world 's countries. No other development driver examined explain anywhere near this muchof the HDI. This demonstrates the very close linkage between development andaccess to basic water and sanitation services. 11Finally, institutions such as the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) have thecapacity to produce legal documents, contrary to other processes, which limitthemselves to political declarations. The second element that explains the success of the initiatives of Tajikistan is the constant involvement of the highest levels of the state. The stability in power of the 11See the remarks of the UN Secretary General at the Opening Ceremony of the High Level International Conference on the Implementation of the International Decade for Action \"Water for Life\" held on 9 June 2015 in Dushanbe.Table 3 Main processes of global water governance Process Launch Secretariat Actors Aim Notes InternationalHydrologicalProgramme (IHP)1976 Paris Governments To promote research on water issuesSupported byUNESCO World Water Week (WWW)1991 Stockholm Experts and decision-makersTo provide a plat- form to expe- rience andperspectivesOrganized by the Stockholm InternationalWater Institute(SIWI) HelsinkiConvention1992 Geneva Governments To provide a regional framework for the management of transboundarywatercoursesSupported by UNECE but open to coun- tries in thewhole Global WaterPartnership (GWP)1996 Stockholm Water ment (IWRM)Created withsupport the World UNDP,and Sweden World Water Council(WWC)1996 Marseille Governments, internationalorganizations, NGOsTo raise awareness about public andprivate water managementIt organizes a World WaterForum every 3 years New YorkConvention1997 New York Governments To provide a global framework for the management oftransboundary watercoursesRatied byonly 36 countries UN Water 2003 New York UN agencies To coordinate the action of the UNSoft Power of Tajikistan on the Water Agenda: Cross-Scale Dynamics 111President of the Republic of Tajikistan, Emomali Rahmon, and his regular partic- ipation in many international events, from the UN General Assembly in New Yorkto Rio+20 (2012), from the World Water Forum in Daegu-Gyeongbuk (2015) to the World Water Week in Stockholm, made him a champion of the water cause at the global level. Recognizing his commitment, he was invited by the UN SecretaryGeneral and the President of the World Bank to join the High Level Panel on Water(HLPW). This group is composed of ten heads of state and government and aims atfacilitating the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 6 on water. Aselement of comparison, at the beginning of the 2000s, Kyrgyzstan was promotingthe issue of mountains on the global agenda similarly to the role of Tajikistan for thewater agenda [ 30,31]. The departure from power of the former president of Kyrgyzstan, Askar Akayev, in 2005 represented a signicant blow for the mountainagenda, which has not recovered yet. A third element is the expertise present in the country. Tajikistan can in fact count on a minister of foreign affairs who was trained as a hydrometeorologist, whowrote a doctoral thesis about Sarez Lake, and who worked for many years on watermanagement at the national and regional level before becoming Permanent Repre-sentative of Tajikistan at the UN in New York between 2005 and 2013. Thanks tohis expertise of water issues and his knowledge of the UN system, he plays a key role in the development and implementation of the initiatives of Tajikistan. More- over, the presence for many years of a young and energetic deputy minister incharge of water resources, who is very dynamic and respected also at the interna-tional level, is another asset of the country. To this, one must add an interministerialteam whose experience increased with each initiative. The conferences hosted inDushanbe also contribute to the capacity building of the staff involved in theprocess and to keep in the country talents that would otherwise leave the publicsector for private companies, international organizations, or abroad. All these elements constitute the \"Dushanbe Spirit\" that is much appreciated during water conferences in Tajikistan. Moreover, participants are alwaysimpressed by the traditional hospitality of the Tajik people. Tajikistan providesthe international community with a platform, whose philosophy is close to that ofthe World Water Week in Stockholm, integrating it within a UN framework. Bydoing this, Tajikistan provides a public good that is appreciated by the most part ofthe international community and by the UN, which openly supports these initia-tives, mainly through the Country Ofce of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Dushanbe and the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) of the UN Secretariat in New York. The participation of the UNSecretary General at the High Level International Conference on the implementa-tion of the International Decade for Action \"Water for Life\" in 2015 was a sign ofstrong appreciation (Fig. 3).J.M. Church 1124 An Assessment of 15 Years of Initiatives and the New Water Decade The assessment of the water initiatives of Tajikistan is positive. It is however important to highlight a certain number of issues. First, despite substantial efforts,there is still room for improvement in water management in Tajikistan. The UNSpecial Rapporteur on the Human Rights to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation hasrecently urged the Tajik government \"to reach out to the millions of peoplecurrently without access to safe drinking water and sanitation in the country.\" 12 Moreover, the situation of the Aral Sea remains desperate [ 32]. Finally, at the global level, some countries resist to the initiatives of Tajikistan, expressing doubts aboutthe capacity of the UN to support the global governance of this precious resourceand about the capacity of the country to provide leadership on this issue. Forinstance, with about 1,000 hotel rooms and an airport with a capacity of less than5,000 passengers per day, it would have been impossible for Dushanbe to host the46,000 participants in the World Water Forum in 2015. 12Press release of 12 August 2015. Fig. 3 The UN Secretary General, the President of Tajikistan, and the Prime Minister of Pakistan during the Water for Life Conference in Dushanbe ( Source : Press Service of the President of Tajikistan (2015))Soft Power of Tajikistan on the Water Agenda: Cross-Scale Dynamics 113However, the positive elements greatly exceed the limits. Other than the recogni- tion of the country and its leaders as water champions at the global level, it is important to mention the nancial support provided to Tajikistan from many partners for the development of its water resources, starting from the implementation of the water sector reform at the level of the seven basins of the country and for theimprovement of drinking water supply and sanitation in both urban and rural areas.Nevertheless, the greatest success is the signature in 2016 of the framework agree-ment for the erection of the Rogun dam. The beginning of the construction of CASAmust also be highlighted. This is a clear sign of the fact that the conditions required tomake the investments necessary for the realization of these infrastructures start to bemet. The role of the water initiatives of Tajikistan should not be underestimated. They contribute to build condence in the country, as well as its capacity. At the global level, the initiatives of Tajikistan, such as the International Decade for Action \"Water for Life,\" contributed to achieve 5 years in advance the target set for access to drinking water in the framework of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. 13The global conferences in Dushanbe on water have also contributed to raise awareness of the international community on vulnerable groups such aswomen and children, as well as on the specic issues of least developed countries.Strong of this positive experience and encouraged by many actors, the president of Tajikistan now wants to gain a new momentum to existing initiatives. In 2015, he proposed therefore to launch a new International Decade for Action \"Water forSustainable Development,\" aimed at contributing to the achievement of SustainableDevelopment Goal 6 and its targets, i.e., to \"ensure availability and sustainablemanagement of water and sanitation for all.\" A new resolution was presented to the UN General Assembly in 2016. If many countries oppose the creation of new international days, years, and decades, themajority of member states supported this initiative of Tajikistan to extend the existing process. As a result, the UN General Assembly declared the International Decade for Action \"Water for Sustainable Development\" (2018-2028). The reso-lution was sponsored by 177 UN member states and adopted by consensus. 14This new decade aims at improving knowledge generation and dissemination andemphasizes the need to step up of international cooperation and collaboration inscience, research, and innovation for the sustainable development of waterresources. Water is an essential resource for life. Its management cannot be improvised. The timeframe is necessarily long. The international years and especially thedecades proposed by Tajikistan encourage long-term action and vision. It is there-fore important to add the temporal scale to the various spatial levels to fullyunderstand the action of Tajikistan on water issues [ 33]. These two dimensions represent not only central elements for the hydropower development of the country 13Document A/71/260 of 28 July 2016. 14Document A/RES/71/222 of 21 December 2016.J.M.

We claim that water governance plays a key role in addressing these issues in the region. However, we argue that looking at multilevel governance is not sufficient to address the major challenges for water governance in Central Asia. We suggest looking beyond the spatial, administrative and normative scales and include also on other scales, such as time, planning and knowledge. Based on a review of the mainstream literature, which focuses on the spatial, normative and administrative dimension, as well as of research on other scales, we highlight the importance of other scales, as well as of their interaction. Due to the high level of interdependence of these elements, we observe that cooperation and integration prevail over conflict and disintegration.

We therefore suggest that this progress should be measured in all dimensions of water governance: not only the spatial, administrative and normative scales, but also the temporal, planning, relational and knowledge ones. Graphical/Visual Abstract and Caption Introduction: water resources in Central AsiaCentral Asia is a region located south of the Russian Federation, west of China, north of the Islamic Republics of Iran and Afghanistan and east of the Caspian Sea (Dukhovny & Schutter, 2011). Azerbaijan, the northern provinces of Afghanistan and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China are sometimes considered to be also part of the Central Asian region. In this article, we will focus on the Aral Sea Basin, which corresponds to the most populated part of the region, covers the Progress should be measured in all dimensions of water governance: space, time, institutions, norms, plans, relations and knowledgePage 2 of 25 John Wiley & SonsWIREs Water 1 23456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 119For Peer Review 3southern part of Central Asia and constitutes the third largest endorheic basin in the world (Figure 1). The Aral Sea Basin is composed of two major sub-basins, i.e. the Amudarya Basin to the south and Syrdarya Basin to the north, as well as two minor endorheic but interconnected sub-basins, i.e. the Murgab and the Harirud, which flow from into & Kosarev, 2010; Zonn, Glantz, Kostianoy, & Kosarev, 2009). The major challenge for the management of water resources in Central Asia is to ensure that there is sufficient water to feed a growing population, to produce enough goods and services for growing economies and sustain vital life support systems in the context of a changing and uncertain future climate, geopolitical trends and urbanization. All this complicates but also makes imperative to take more proactive measures towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal Six (SDG 6), particularly ensuring safe drinking water and sanitation for all, implementing integrated water resources management (IWRM) at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation. It is also important to address the disappearance of the Aral Sea, which shrank to more than one tenth of its original size over the last sixty years. The UN Secretary General described visiting the area in June 2018 as a \"tremendous shock\". Other major challenges include increasing water efficiency and productivity, as well as the management of transboundary waters, given that all major basins are transboundary. In this article, we claim that water governance plays a key role in addressing these issues (Taylor & Sonnenfeld, 2017), particularly in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (Kanie & Biermann, 2017; Monkelbaan, 2019). Issues such as the disappearance of the Aral Sea and water scarcity are in fact rarely the result of physical lack of water resources. For instance, between the Amudarya and the Syrdarya, while it is the Syrdarya that, at least theoretically suffers the highest levels of water stress, it is the Amudarya that displays higher levels of water scarcity, especially in the longer run (Dukhovny et al., 2018; Revenga, Brunner, Henninger, Kassem, & Payne, 2000). This is mainly due to poor management, insufficient water accounting and lack of effective coordination mechanisms across sectors and countries. Water governance is the political, institutional, regulatory and judicial context where water management takes place and that can influence its outcomes in terms both of social performance, environmental performance and externalities to other socio-ecological systems (McGinnis & Ostrom, 2014; Ostrom, 2009). We mobilize the concept of governance instead of simply government not to limit ourselves to the role of government organizations, but to include all other types of actors that contribute to addressing these issues, such as international organizations, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, as well as academia, and the actions they take. Also, the concept of governance allows to put forward the need of governmental organizations to reach out to other actors and engage in multi-stakeholder processes (Andersson, 2016; van Zeijl-Rozema, C\u00f6rvers, Kemp, & Martens, 2008). Moreover, governance takes place at multiple levels: global, regional, national and local. The concept of multilevel governance (Finger, Tamiotti, & Allouche, 2006; Hooghe & Marks, 2003; OECD, 2011) has gained currency to highlight how governmental organizations act within nested systems where they interact with international organizations, local authorities, as well as non-governmental organizations (Howlett & Rayner, 2006). In this respect, we argue that looking at multilevel governance is not sufficient to address the major challenges for water governance in Central Asia. As follow-up to Wegerich (2004), we suggest that, to better understand water governance in the region, it is important to also consider different scales, including institutions, but also space, time and other dimensions, as well as the different levels therein.

In the paragraphs below, we illustrate each scale with at least one relevant example, hence explaining why each scale should be taken into consideration to better understand water governance in Central Asia. Of course, these scales and the levels therein interact in a complex manner. Their interaction is a gap in the current literature on water governance in Central Asia, which shall be further explored. UNDERSTANDING WATER GOVERNANCE ACROSS SCALES Research on water governance in Central Asia often focuses on the spatial and institutional dimension, focusing on the relations between upstream and downstream countries and on the international legal framework that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union (Boisson 2018). However, there are several other scales that are relevant to understand water governance in Central Asia, such as time, planning and knowledge. For example, the high seasonality of water resources in Central Asia may result in conflicts of use between the release of water for irrigated agriculture in summer and the retention of water in reservoirs for hydropower production in winter, when the inflow of water from mountain glaciers is lower. To understand the nexus between water, food, energy and the environment, it is therefore essential to take into consideration at least the time and knowledge scales, together with the spatial and institutional scale (Granit et al., 2012). The lack of consideration for other scales in the mainstream literature can be explained by increasing methodological challenges due to the multiplication of the scales considered and by the difficult access to information about other scales due to logistical and language barriers. In this article, we propose to address this challenge by building on the theoretical framework to analyse scale and cross-scale dynamics put forward by Cash et al. (2006). Moreover, we base our analysis on our long-term first-hand experience of water governance in Central Asia. Following Gibson, Ostrom, and Ahn (2000), Cash and colleagues define \"scale\" as the \"spatial, temporal, quantitative, or analytical dimensions used to measure and study any phenomenon\" and \"levels\" as the \"units of analysis that are located at different positions on a scale\" (p. 7). They identify seven types of scale: spatial, temporal, jurisdictional (administrations), institutional (normative), management (planning), networks (relations) and knowledge. In Figure 2, we propose a slight adaptation of the key scales and levels identified by Cash and colleagues to better suit the Central Asian context. Cash and colleagues then identify five types of interaction among different levels and scales: multilevel single-scale, cross-level single-scale, as cross-level cross-scale. Single-scale means that actions remain confined to different levels within a single scale, such as the hierarchical relations between legal documents such as a constitution that may give the right to all citizens to accessible and safe drinking water and sanitation and the laws and regulations that are subordinate to the provisions contained in the constitution; multilevel and multi-scale mean that actions occur at different levels within different scales without necessarily observing interactions across levels and scales, such as research on water resources that may take place at the national and international level on spatial issues at the local and regional level but may not refer to each other; cross-level and cross-scale mean instead that actions at one level and scale are interrelated with actions at other levels and scales, thus constituting interactions. This is the typical situation for the integrated management of complex issues and wicked problems such as water resources (Levin, Page 4 of 25 John Wiley & SonsWIREs Water 1 23456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 121For & Auld, 2012; Rittel & Webber, 1973). For instance, disaster risk reduction of issues such as flooding imply flows that go from upstream to downstream that interact with short-term meteorological phenomena and long-term climate dynamics and that are dealt with through a nested system of national and local plans that sometimes overlap with basin plans, just to give an idea of the complexity of many water-related issues. However, in the economy of this review article, it will not be possible to address each type of interaction among different scales and each respective level. This is a gap in the scientific literature on water governance in Central Asia that, in our opinion, needs to be filled. We are convinced that addressing these interactions allows to better understand water governance in Central Asia. WATER GOVERNANCE ACROSS SCALES AND LEVELS In the paragraphs below, we therefore review interactions within the seven different scales identified by Cash et al. (2006) regarding water resources in Central Asia. We provide brief case studies to exemplify what we see as the main challenges of each scale. These cases are not representative of all configurations. While they focus on important issues, we do not claim that they are an exhaustive survey of the most important issues of water governance in Central Asia. They are mere illustrations of the need to look across scales. We then discuss how taking into consideration each scale contributes to better understand water governance in the region. Finally, we discuss the implications of cross-scale water governance in Central Asia. Spatial scale: upstream and downstream The first scale that needs to be taken into consideration when analysing water governance in Central Asia is space. Within both major sub-basins of the Aral Sea, there are upstream and downstream countries. Regarding the Amudarya, the river and its tributaries flow from Tajikistan, Afghanistan and to a much lesser degree Kyrgyzstan, then forms the border between Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, crosses the territory of Turkmenistan and returns and ends up in Uzbekistan; the Syrdarya originates in Kyrgyzstan and flows to Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and once again Tajikistan before reaching once more Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Considering the Aral Sea Basin, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan can therefore be considered as upstream countries. Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are both upstream and downstream, while Kazakhstan is purely downstream (Lipponen, 2011). An upstream position physically gives countries and communities within countries the possibility to withdraw water that flows downstream. Those in a downstream position may suffer from water scarcity because of excessive withdrawals upstream. Water governance plays a key role in making sure that the needs of the countries upstream and downstream are both taken into consideration. In Central Asia, this usually takes place within national and regional institutions, basin organizations, as well as bilateral and multilateral discussions (Wegerich 2015). The importance of the spatial configuration is highlighted in the case below, which is representative of many similar situations throughout the region. The Karshi cascade consists in the 87-kilometre long Karshi canal and pumping scheme that takes water from the southern part of Turkmenistan to the Kashkadarya steppe (also known as Karshinskaya) where the Karshi city is located in the southern part of Uzbekistan (Glantz, 1999, pp. 31, 166; Kostianoy & Kosarev, 2010, p. 80). It was built between 1961 and 1973. It was meant to implement an \"integrated approach to the development of virgin lands\" (Dukhovny & Schutter, 2011, Page 5 of 25 John Wiley & SonsWIREs Water 1 23456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 122For Peer Review 6p. 216), which can be seen as an early version of integrated water resources management (Dukhovny & Horst, 2008). The deviation starts near the Kyzyl-Ayak village in Turkmenistan. Six large pump stations located on the Turkmen side lift water 132 meters above the Amudarya (Dukhovny & Schutter, 2011, pp. 164-167). With an intake of up to 5 km\u00b3 of water per year, it is among the major diversions of the Amudarya. It transfers water to the Kashkadarya, which is an endorheic basin in Uzbekistan and doubles the irrigated area from 500 to 1,000 thousand hectares. The Talimardjan reservoir was built in on the Uzbek side to regulate water supply and its level is a key indicator for water management in the area. Drainage water is collected through a system of collector canals to the Sultandak reservoir. The Shordarya canal was built in 1987 to return at least some of the water back to the Amudarya to try counter the disappearance of the Aral Sea despite the high salinity and low quality of drainage water (UNECE, 2006, p. 80). More than 800 thousand people live in the area and the livelihoods of a significant proportion of them depend on irrigated agriculture, usually large farms growing cotton. The pumping stations were rehabilitated in the 2000s with the support of the World Bank. Moreover, the economic viability of the irrigation scheme depends on the provision of cheap energy to operate the pumping stations. Coordination between upstream Turkmenistan and midstream Uzbekistan is therefore essential to ensure the functionality of the Karshi cascade and sustain the local community. Temporal scale: path dependency Given that water quality and quantity change over time (both within a year and in the long run), temporal scale with its emphasis on rates, durations or frequencies is more than relevant to water management. This subsection will look at the importance of seasonality and climate change in the region, as well as the impact of the Soviet heritage on contemporary water governance in Central Asia. Central Asia has a rather unique model of transboundary water governance deriving from its history and characterized by multiple dimensions of path dependency. Massive water storage infrastructure and distribution networks that were built in Soviet time and continue connecting upstream, middle stream and downstream areas across the region in a complicated way is among the most telling examples of technical path dependency in the world. In institutional terms, the transboundary water management system is also heavily grounded on pre-independence norms, organizations and practices. With the 1992 Almaty Agreement, 1 Central Asian countries validated the Soviet-time Schemes for Integrated Water Resources Use and Protection for the Amudarya and Syrdarya, which were evidence-based analytical and strategic planning documents, equivalent to huge river basin plans. 2 The two basin water organisations (BWOs) for the Amudarya and Syrdarya, created in 1987 to deal with inter-republic and inter-sectoral distribution of water and to operate inter-republic irrigation canals and collectors, were put under the Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (ICWC) in Central Asia, also established in 1992. Similarly, the Commission decided to establish a Scientific Information Centre (SIC), based on the Central Asian Irrigation Research Institute (SANIIRI) established in 1925, making use of the scientific potential of one of the oldest research institutions in Central Asia. Finally, informal practices and connections among water professionals - especially irrigation engineers - established in the pre-independence time have been forming and influencing decision-making over the last 25 years, even though many specialists had to leave their jobs due to low salaries and other reasons. Moss and Dobner (2016) observe, for example, that whilst striving to improve the efficiency Page 6 of 25 John Wiley & SonsWIREs Water 1 23456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 123For Peer Review 7of irrigation systems modern water bureaucracies are reinforcing the path dependency of not only the physical infrastructure but also its own raison d'\u00eatre, recalling the heyday of the Soviet irrigation engineering. Indeed, water profession in the Soviet time was highly respected and well paid and the Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water Recourses of the USSR was one of the most influential ministries at that time. Despite being path dependent in many ways, transboundary water governance system in Central Asia cannot be regarded as static. Rather, the system and its main actors (regional and national stakeholders) have been adapting - with different degrees of success - to shifting conditions, as well as political, economic and organisational settings. Those changes included technical measures, such as the construction of new facilities to address seasonal imbalances, shifting of crops and harnessing untapped hydropower potential, as well as institutional arrangements, such as regular meetings of the ICWC, bilateral interactions, technical group meetings and many others. Given the complexity of the issues and underlying interests, this process has been non-linear and contested in many ways. It is worth mentioning that constant restructuring and reshaping governmental institutions also lead to diminishing the influence and power of water ministries that were often merged with either agriculture or energy. It is safe to conclude that the radical transformation of political and economic relations in the region has been accompanied by strong path dependency in the area of water management. The need for change, also because of the observed and expected impact of climate change, has been also pushed by many forces, requiring more forward-looking and adaptive management practices. It is well known that the main issues in water management and allocation in the Amudarya and Syrdarya basins have to do with accommodating different seasonal requirements of two dominant water uses: hydropower production and irrigated agriculture. Existing controversies may increase in the future due to the impacts of climate change on water availability, especially during the growing season. For instance, according to Dukhovny et al. (2018), trends of climate change in the Amudarya basin suggest that, according to average warming scenario, by 2050 water availability will be decreasing in the growing season on the main rivers of the basin such as Vaksh (by 5%), Surkhandarya (by 6%), Kafirnigan (by 8%), Zeravshan (by 11%), with decrease in the summer months ranging from 15 up to 35%. Also, the frequency of extreme water events is expected to increase dramatically making it even harder for water managers to ensure the working conditions of water systems. On the good side of things, existing and planned multipurpose reservoirs may play an important role in regulating the inter-seasonal flow and reducing the risk of disaster. There are also opportunities to harvest positive effects of climate change on plant growth and potential shortening plant development phases. As Stulina and Solodkiy (2015) research in the Fergana Valley demonstrates, the growth of the area's thermal potential due to climate change leads to reaching the sum of effective temperatures in shorter time that allows sowing crops earlier, as well as reducing crop development phase and the growing season as a whole. These findings suggest that water demand may be reduced; time for second crops may also be secured. That kind of research must be better fed into the renewed and more adaptive water management framework in the region.

But it was less successful in dealing with extreme conditions, such as droughts and floods, as well as long-term planning and management, both instrumental for proper water management under climate changes and other types of change (Ziganshina, 2016). Therefore, further enhancement of the system's adaptability is a must. Administrative scale: intergovernmental framework The countries of Central Asia created joint organisations for shared waters immediately after gaining independence, signalling their sovereignty claims but also adopting a pragmatic approach to water management issues. The Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (ICWC) in Central Asia made up of the heads of national water authorities of the five Central Asian countries was established in 1992 with the important mission of ensuring that water is allocated and used by riparian countries in a coordinated way. To this end, the Commission shall meet quarterly to \"elaborate and approve annually water use limits for each republic and the region as a whole, schedule for reservoir operation regimes, correct the former according to updated forecasts, depending on actual water availability and current water-related conditions\" (Article 8, para. 1). It is also entitled to \"determine water policy in the region, elaborate its key directions taking into account all economic branch needs, integrated and rational use of water resources, and long-term regional water supply program and measures for its implementation\" (Article 8, para. 2). In 1993, the ICWC was placed under the newly established Interstate Council on the Aral Sea (ICAS). In 1997, the ICAS was merged with the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) and the ICWC became one out of two commissions operating under its umbrella. As of today, the Commission has five executive bodies, including two Basin Water Organizations (BWO): BWO Amudarya, with its central office in Urgench (Uzbekistan) and four territorial divisions located in Tajikistan (Kurgan-Tyube), Turkmenistan (Turkmenabad) and Uzbekistan (Urgench, Takhiatash); BWO Syrdarya, has its central office located in Tashkent and its territorial divisions spread in the provinces of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan; the Secretariat is located in Tajikistan; the Scientific Information Centre, with its central office in Tashkent and branches in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan; the Coordination Metrological Centre is located in Kyrgyzstan. Despite the challenging geopolitical and socio-economic context, the ICWC and its executive bodies are playing a prominent role in setting up and implementing water allocation quotas, as well as providing a forum for information exchange, building capacity, conducting and coordinating research and joint projects, and in facilitating mutual learning between the riparian countries. Through its decisions, the ICWC gave the green light to introducing advanced approaches to water management, such as integrated water resources management, strengthening informational cooperation, introducing decision support systems and automation of head water facilities (Ziganshina, 2014).

The need for institutional reform was raised by all riparian countries over the last 25 years but most prominently by Kyrgyzstan, which has suspended its participation in the IFAS and its bodies from 2016 because \"the reforms of the IFAS repeatedly proposed by Kyrgyzstan were not carried out\" and the IFAS \"does not take into account hydropower aspects of water use and the requirements of individual countries of Central Asia\". 3 At the Summit of Heads of States that was held on 24 August 2018, the President of the Kyrgyz Republic said that his country was ready to restore its participation in the IFAS, if its comprehensive reform was carried out taking into account the needs and interests of all states. To address these challenges, a special task force on legal and institutional reform comprised of national and regional representatives was created under IFAS. The task force started its work by taking another close look at recommendations prepared in 2010 within the IFAS Kazakhstan-led project on improving institutional framework. 4 At that time, recommendations containing two options for institutional reform could not satisfy countries, with Uzbekistan supporting the softer option of strengthening existing institutions and Kyrgyzstan insisting on radical reform and transformation. There is a hope that this new endeavour taken in a more cooperative era could come up with more satisfactory results, thanks to the ongoing improvement of overall relations among Central Asian republics. The question remains, however, whether Kyrgyzstan will be willing to join this IFAS-led group. It is important to note that the success of institutional reform at the regional level is closely aligned with proactive steps taken at the national level. Given the importance of hydropower development for Tajikistan, this country established the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources in 2013 and its first deputy minister currently represents both water and energy sector at the meetings of ICWC. In Uzbekistan, the Ministry of Water Management was recently formed, among other things, with the intention to separate the regulation of water issues from agriculture, as the largest water user in the country (Yalcin & Mollinga 2007). This example illustrates functional mismatches where the mandate of regional institutions is too narrow to address the existing transboundary water governance problems. Normative scale: ongoing transition process The normative dimension also needs to be considered to understand water governance in Central Asia. It is not enough, however, to look at the constitutional level, where significant differences can already be found; it is also necessary to look at the treaties ratified by each country, the key laws and legal principles that were adopted, as well as the bylaws and other normative acts all the way down to the actual operational rules followed by water service providers and users. Also, the effectiveness of these norms must also be taken into account. In this regard, even if the World Bank ranked Central Asian countries among the bottom third where the rule of law applies the least in the world 5, the normative scale is not irrelevant for water governance in Central Asia, because there are many instances where norms are followed and because norm production is also an opportunity to assess, discuss and possibly improve water management. At the constitutional level, all Central Asian republics gave continuity to the 1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union (Article 11), which mentioned that water and other natural resources are state property. However, if many mention the responsibility of the state to ensure rational use, none goes as far as Page 9 of 25 John Wiley & SonsWIREs Water 1 23456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 126For Peer Review 10explicitly mentioning the need to preserve water quality, as mentioned in the Soviet Constitution (Article 18). No constitution explicitly mentions the human right to water and sanitation, even if each country recognizes it, as it was declared by the United Nations General Assembly, and is engaged in achieving SDG 6. Concerning water-related treaties, there is a divide between upstream and downstream countries. The 1992 Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Helsinki Convention) and the 1997 Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New York Convention) are extremely politicized. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have so far strongly opposed the ratification of the Helsinki Convention, apparently because of fear that it can be interpreted in ways that give too much power to downstream countries over water uses in upstream countries and perhaps also because supporting these conventions would be perceived as unpatriotic in a context of tensions with some neighbouring countries that are not always related to water. So far, only Uzbekistan has ratified the New York Convention. Each country in Central Asia, except Uzbekistan, possesses a so-called Water Code, which functions de facto as a framework law. They were for the most part developed in the early 2000s as part of the transition process from a planned economy. The codes contain the key principles about the organization of water management and coexist with several laws and by-laws on specific aspects. The statutes of the various institutions that oversee water sector are also important. Some of these legal documents provide grounds for the development of private water service providers and some market mechanisms. These normative developments have so far focused on improving the accountability and financial sustainability of water service providers and on creating incentives for water saving through tariffs for household, industrial and irrigation uses. In each Central Asian country, private sector development is limited. Water management is almost entirely controlled by the public sector, with few functioning market mechanisms in place and almost no private water service provider active in the region. This can be explained by the Soviet heritage, a slow privatization process and low levels of domestic and foreign direct investment that are also related to the geopolitical position of the countries in a volatile region. The legal principles enshrined in the post-Soviet constitutions of the early 1990s also contribute to explain the predominance of the public sector. A singular feature of water law in Central Asia is the presence of a specific law on Water User Associations (WUAs) in both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, which are among the few countries in the world having such a law. Both laws were developed under the leadership and with the support of the donor community, particularly USAID and the World Bank. These laws aim at creating the legal conditions to reestablish the communal services in charge of on-farm water distribution, such as allocation, canal maintenance, equipment modernization and accounting, that had been disbanded with the dissolution of collective farms (Dukhovny, 2017). The implementation and revision of these laws is a complicated and sometimes controversial process. Even if some WUAs are performing well, they are often perceived as bureaucratic structures with little capacity. Their effectiveness is hard to evaluate (Balasubramanya, Price, & Horbulyk, 2018; D\u00f6rre & Goibnazarov, 2018). Planning scale: implementing IWRM and the basin approach IWRM has been practiced in water management and agriculture development of Central Asia long before independence, which can be illustrated by an integrated approach to desert lands development Page 10 of 25 John Wiley & SonsWIREs Water 1 23456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 127For Golodnaya Steppe and other steppes. Dukhovny and colleagues observe that water management in the Soviet republics of Central Asia has been taking into account the hydrographic principle (several basin organisations were established), the need to coordinate between water users across multiple levels, water conservation and consolidated records for all types of waters and their uses, but two key principles of the contemporary IWRM - public participation and economic and financial viability - were not present (Dukhovny, Sokolov, & Ziganshina, 2014) before independence. The absence of these two principles made it challenging for newly independent countries of Central Asia to cope with water management problems in the light of transition to market economy, commercialisation and geopolitical settings. In addition to integration of these two principles, new social, economic, political and industrial conditions also called for reassessment of old approaches and practices to water resources management in the regi on, which became ineffective. Hence, with help from development partners countries have been re-introducing IWRM principles in the region. The five Central Asian republics are still in transition from a planned economy and particularly the system of water management in place before independence, which was highly focused on engineering solutions, employed a huge workforce and was highly centralized. However, the system in place did not respect the borders of the newly independent states, suffered from low productivity and contributed to disasters such as the disappearance of the Aral Sea. Since the late 1990s, the water sector of each country underwent a profound and ongoing reform process from a state-centric and technology-centred system to what Abdullaev and Rakhmatullaev (2015) call \"socio-political control\", which is more centred around social structures and political processes. In this context, policy documents and their production processes are key supports to bring together different institutions and structures and co-produce solutions that are meant to address existing problems. These documents go from overall concepts of state policy with regard to water resources to long term national strategies with concrete targets, such as the one that Tajikistan is currently developing to ensure the achievement of SDG 6 by 2030 (Church, 2018). These documents also include more specific programs, usually accompanied by implementation and investment plans, under which many projects can be developed. While the proliferation of policy and planning documents that can be observed in Central Asia is certainly rooted in the planned economy of the Soviet Union, this also corresponds to the needs of so-called development partners or donor countries and organizations, such as the European Union (EU), its member states, particularly Germany, plus Switzerland, which are by far the largest donors in the water sector in Central Asia, but also the United States, Japan, Canada, the Republic of Korea and other developed countries. Among donor organizations, it is possible to mention the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, the United Nations Development Programme, the Aga Khan Foundation, together with many others. These policy and planning documents are useful to ensure donor coordination and to identify areas where to focus development aid. This may partially explain the relative success of the National Policy Dialogues on Integrated Water Resources Management that were launched in the 2000s under the EU Water Initiative and implemented in all Central Asian republics except Uzbekistan by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) together with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). While they serve as a de facto National Water Council, i.e. ministerial-level platform to encourage intersectoral and multistakeholder dialogue within the countries, they also Page 11 of 25 John Wiley & SonsWIREs Water 1 23456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 128For Peer Review 12helped introduce in Central Asia the principles of the 2000 EU Water Framework Directive (Dukhovny, Mirzaev, & Sokolov, 2008; Wouters, Dukhovny, & Allan, 2007). While many administrative structures remain, each country is progressively currently moving from the administrative management of water resources towards a basin approach (Wegerich 2015). Following the French and European model, ministries in charge of water are in the process of deconcentrating their functions with the establishment of River Basin Organizations, alongside River Basin Councils that are meant to ensure intersectoral and multistakeholder dialogue at the basin level. Sub-basin organizations and councils are also being created, if necessary. At the same time, as Dukhovny et al (2014) observe institutional water reforms in the region illustrate the greater focus on augmenting water supply rather than managing water demand. Currently water management organisations and their various divisions are responsible for both water delivery and water use, so they pay less attention to managing demand, which is regulated within administrative units rather than hydrographic boundaries. It is unsure whether the reforms that are currently being developed and piloted in all Central Asian republics with the support of development partners will manage to address major issues, such as drastically improving water productivity and efficiency to restore the Aral Sea, not leaving anyone behind in the achievement of SDG 6, continue developing the hydropower and irrigation potential in both the Amudarya and Syrdarya basins, ensuring the good ecological status of surface and underground waters, as well as significantly increasing public and private investment in the water sector, particularly with regard to disaster risk reduction. The current institutional reforms provide however an opportunity and incentives to renew and streamline management practices, improve the knowledge base, train and increase the capacity of human resources at all levels, as well as improve working conditions, thanks to investment in new equipment and buildings. Last but not least, basin-level institutions are supposed to better fit the dynamics of river basins, something that the mere coordination of administrative-level institutions struggles to do. In this regard, it is important to note that these are long term transformation processes, whose benefits will be fully understood only in a few decades. Relational scale: top-down and peer-to-peerAs we have seen above, hierarchies, i.e. vertical, top-down, formal actor relations, dominate transboundary water governance in Central Asia. This does not mean, however, that networks or informal relations are not embedded into these hierarchies; rather they are co-evolving and interdependent. Informal relations have played a significant role in promoting compliance with existing water agreements and new interests and needs of the riparian countries as well as in building vertical and horizontal connections across the spectrum of old and new actors. ICWC has mechanisms to ensure that top-down instructions from its members are informed by bottom-up communications of informal or semi-formal communities of water users. For example, the SDC funded IWRM-Fergana project implemented by national water authorities of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan together with SIC ICWC and IWMI has been using social mobilization and networking practices to facilitate mutual learning and acceptance in addition to more formal institutional arrangements. Similarly, activities of the ICWC Regional Training is built on the idea that networking with professional colleagues in less formal settings helps to address complex cooperation problems that span organizational boundaries.

For example, the Network of Water Management Organisations from Eastern Europe Caucasus and Central Asia that was established in 2008 allows its members to exchange views, experiences and information on various aspects of water management activity in a collaborative learning and informal environment, which is difficult to cultivate in the context of hierarchical structures. Institutions outside the IFAS system, such as Central Asian Regional Environmental Centre (CAREC), are also actively engaged into regional water interactions promoting intersectoral dialogue, building capacity and enhancing the role of the civil society in sustainable development activities in Central Asia. Knowledge scale: information exchange The most active actor in the Central Asian water related knowledge domain is SIC ICWC, as its activities focus on conducting locally relevant research, producing expert advice, as well as collecting, analysing and disseminating water-related data, information and knowledge in the region and beyond. With the help of the SDC, SIC ICWC established the Central Asian Regional Water Information Base (CAWater-Info) and Portal ( www.cawater-info.net ) that embraces large volumes of information, including knowledge base and regional information system. The CAWater-Info Knowledge Base is regularly enriched with best practices in water management, irrigated agriculture and associated sectors from the region's own past and present experience, as well as from other parts of the world. This knowledge system adds value through adapting global and regional knowledge to local conditions, facilitating regional knowledge exchange, enabling continuous learning and education, promoting knowledge transfer to end-users, as well as supporting decision makers and practitioners. Further steps to expand and strengthen knowledge exchange in the region are needed. For example, the CAWater-Info Knowledge Base can be transformed into a more innovative platform that brings together a network of researchers, practitioners and decision makers to share experiences and lessons learnt from managing water and related resources. To do this, it is necessary to enhance regional ownership through the involvement of a broader community of experts and practitioners across the region and focus on target groups' (knowledge consumers) needs and preferences in knowledge dissemination for them to use knowledge in a meaningful and effective way. Despite all the efforts of SIC ICWC and partner organisations, the availability of water-related data, information and knowledge in Central Asia is still problematic. Meters are limited. The equipment is often obsolete. Measurements are difficult to compare and aggregate. This can result in unreliable data that does not correspond with the reality on the ground. Moreover, measurements are sometimes still collected and stored in non-digital format. Of course, this includes historical data, which was sometimes lost because of the collapse of the Soviet Union and events such as civil war in Tajikistan and the two revolutions in Kyrgyzstan. Computer-based water information systems are being developed, often with the support of development partners. Moreover, some data is classified. This complicates access and limits the possibility of identifying trends and therefore develop evidence-based scenarios.

Official data is often based on expert estimates, calculated based on figures that sometimes date back to the Soviet period, adjusted to current parameters such as population and economic growth. This data is regularly published by statistical offices and is used for planning and policy-making purposes. This data is sometimes contested by the general public, including through social media, by neighbouring countries, particularly with regard to water allocation, as well as by development partners. This limits the capacity of evidence-based decision-making, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis challenges such as climate change and natural disasters. The Central Asian governments are trying to address this issue through several projects to improve the situation at the national and basin level. Development partners, who contribute to these efforts, sometimes resort to their own household surveys and remote sensing to gather some information, develop their own water-related databases and publish their data online or through various supports. The quality of this data however is also variable. It is rarely based on representative samples and can be methodologically inconsistent when not performed regularly. Central Asian governments love to cite data Data show the progress achieved and to produce targets that catalyse action. This is in keeping with the practices of the Soviet Union. Even if data is often based on rough estimates and targets can be hard to verify, it is useful to show differences between periods and between countries and areas and they are used to justify prioritizing actions, also within the same country and at the interagency level. The five Central Asian republics look at where they stand with regard to several indicators, particularly compared to their neighbours, to other CIS countries and to OECD members.Page 14 of 25 John Wiley & SonsWIREs Water 1 23456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 131For Peer Review 15Figures and Tables Figure 1: River system in Central Asia (author: Zoi Environment Network 2017) Figure 2: Schematic illustrations of different scales (letters) and levels (numbers), redrawn from Cash et al.

Instead, we chose to show how multidimensional water governance in the region is by adopting a conceptual framework that highlights different scales and levels. In doing so, we reviewed and brought together the mainstream literature, which usually focuses on the spatial and normative dimension, as well as research dealing with other scales. This allows to highlight the importance of multi-level and cross-scale interactions and how interdependent these elements are on each other. We learned, for instance, that upstream-downstream dynamics among riparian countries cannot explain management practices by themselves. For example, significant levels of path dependency from the Soviet period can still be observed. Developments such as the EU Water Framework Directive, IWRM and the basin approach also have an impact on planning activities and that the diffusion of these norms are usually channelled through development partners such as the World Bank or the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In such an interdependent context (Keohane & Nye, 1977), it is not surprising to see countries resort to soft more than hard power (Menga & Mirumachi, 2016; Nye, 1990) to advance their national agendas and to observe more cooperation and integration than conflict and disintegration (Church, 2014). While there are regular tensions on the release of sufficient amounts of water for irrigation, on the development of some hydropower plants and their reservoirs, on the functioning and financing of IFAS, on the sharing of data and information, on their interpretation with regard to the projected impacts of climate change, the norm is good neighbourly relations. Countries and communities work together every day at all levels to ensure the rational use and sustainable development of water resources. The trend is positive and is accelerating with the arrival of a new president in Uzbekistan and the subsequent improvement of regional and bilateral cooperation. The water initiatives of Tajikistan at the global level and particularly the Water Decades also contribute to establish an open platform for policy dialogue (Church, 2017). With all five Central Asian republics engaged in one way or the other in promoting water cooperation and with the new president of Uzbekistan and the minister of foreign affairs of Tajikistan who are both hydrologists by training, there is hope for high level political commitment on water and progress on water governance in the region at all levels. Based on the perspectives put forward in this review article, we suggest that this progress should be measured on all the dimensions of water governance: not only the spatial, administrative and normative scales, but also the temporal, planning, relational and knowledge ones.

Water Planning Jon Marco Church, Ph.D. Associate Professor, HABITER Research Labora tory, University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne Reims, France, jon-marco.church@univ-reims.fr Definitions Water plans are policy instruments with varying degrees of legal bindingness to guide future use, development and protection of water resources. They can also be considered boundary objects that are co-produced by relevant authorities, experts and water users and other stakeholders. Water planning is the process by which the use, development and protection of water resources over time is anticipated to prevent conflict over wa ter use, as well as water scarcity and depletion. It may or may not lead to a water plan. Keywords water planning, water plan, water strategy, river basin, integrated water resources management If you don't know what to do, start planning. (Anonymous) 1. Water planning and Sustainable Development Goals All countries engage in one way or the other in wa ter planning. Forms of water planning have existed at least since the first irrigation and urban water supply schemes that appeared thousands of years ago (Parker and Penning-Rowsel 1981; Helweg 1985 ; Grafton and Hussey 2011; Loucks and Beek 2017). In the United States, water planning has been a responsibility of the United States Army Corps of Engineers since 1850 and the first water plans as standalone documents appeared during the second half of the 19 Pth P century. Kinds of water plans differ from one country to the other. Not all countries require the development of water plans or of certain kinds of water plans. For instance, countries that rarely suffer from droughts are unlike ly to develop plans to deal with water scarcity. A certain variability within countries can also be observed, as not all regions face the same chal-lenges. For example, coastal areas may face infilt ration of salted water in groundwater aquifers, while other areas may not. Central governments sometimes leave the development of certain kinds of plans to the discretion of local authorities, assuming sufficient capacity is present on the ground. To assist local authorities in the development of water plans, central governments and national agencies may develop guidelines, which play an important role for the harmonization of plans; like- wise, to assist developing countries, internatio nal organizations such as the United Nations and other development partners also develop guidelines for the development of different kinds of water plans. Experts and consulting firms also play an e ssential role in the circulation of planning prac- tices at all levels. At the international level, countries are not requir ed to produce water plans. The only exception is the 2000 EU Water Framework Directive, which re quires European Union Member States to de- velop River Basin Management Plans for each river basin and review them on a six-year basis (De Stefano and Hern\u00e1ndez-Mora 2012). Under the 1992 United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on the Protection an d Use of Transboundary Watercourses and Inter- national Lakes (Helsinki Convention) and other co operation processes, parties are encouraged to 1432 create joint commissions and develop joint plan s for transboundary wate rs (UNECE 2009). The principles of international law, including those contained in the Helsinki Convention, in the 1997 United Nations Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New York Convention) and the 2008 Articles on Law of Transboundary Aquifers, guide riparian countries, which can be located upstream or downst ream, to agree on mutually beneficial solutions to shared water problems. Water planning in tran sboundary contexts is an important tool for pre- ventive diplomacy to avoid future water use conflicts. Over the last decades, global development agendas supported the emergence of water planning as a norm, encouraging the development of certain kinds of plans. For instance, the 1992 Agenda 21 suggested the preparation of plans for various ki nds of water uses at different levels. Moreover, the Plan of Implementation of the 2002 World Su mmit on Sustainable Development stressed the need for integrated water resources management (IWRM) (Matondo 2002) and water efficiency plans and for strategies, plans and programmes at the river basin, watershed and groundwater level. These commitments were reaffirmed by the 2012 Rio+20 Outcome Document \"The Future We Want\". Even if the 2030 Agenda for Sustaina ble Development has no direct SDG target on water planning, water planning is a key component of target 6.5 on the implementation of IWRM at all levels. Water planning and plans are taken into consideration in the definition of both indicator 6.5.1 on integrated water resources management, whose custodian is the United Nations Environ- ment Programme (UN Environment), and indicator 6.5.2 on transboundary basin area with water cooperation, whose custodians are UNECE and th e United Nations Education, Scientific and Cul- tural Organization (UNESCO) (UN-Water 2018). In the latter case, water cooperation is measured in terms of the existence of \"operational arrangements\", which include water agreements, plans, com- missions and other processes and excludes tools that are not in force or dormant. Water planning is a useful instrument to ensure the achievement of SDG 6 and other water-related goals and targets at the national, basin and loca l level. By identifying necessary and sufficient measures meant to solve the main problems to achieve water-related SDGs, water planning con- tributes to the optimization of government actio n, such as the rationalization of human resource and expenditure allocation, both investment and operation and maintenance. When water-related targets are clear, such as target 6.1 to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and afford-able drinking water for all or other nationally appropriate targets, this can sometimes be done through backcasting, where the long-term targets can be broken down into short-term and mid- term intermediary targets and milestones. Water planning may also allow prioritizing areas and sectors that are in most need an d that may accelerate the achievement of SDGs. This is important to make sure that no one is left behind, in ac cordance to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Devel- opment. Water planning may also allow for burden sh aring at the basin and local level. For instance, in a given country, a certain basin or city may be farther from an SDG target than others; in this case, this basin or city may be requested to make more efforts than others, which may have already done particular efforts in the past. Water planni ng can help develop and implement burden sharing. The SDG monitoring framework is also useful for wa ter planning, particularly at the national level. To monitor the implementation of the SDGs and the achievement of water-related targets, the United Nations developed a set of indicators at the national level and many of its agencies and programs are involved in collecting them. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is currently helping several developing countries with the production of integrated assessments of SDG readiness, which include dashboards of SDG in dicators. Together with official statistics and other data, these dashboards can be useful to pr ovide the information base that is necessary to ensure that water planning is evidence-based an d to monitor the achievement of SDG 6 and other water-related goals and targets (Church 2018). They usually build on official statistics, data availa- ble to the United Nations and other policy documents, such as national level sectorial plans. These dashboards are also useful to identify gaps in the information base and policy documents and eventually decide on proceeding with further data collection and policy development. They are also 1443 useful to perform an integrated analysis of water plans and other water-related sectorial plans, such as plans on poverty reduction, land reform, industrial development and environmental protec- tion. 2. Typology of water planning and plans Water planning can be more plan-oriented or pro- cess-oriented (Fig. 1). This means that water plan-ning can revolve around the design, approval, mon-itoring, evaluation and revision of water plans, in which case it can be considered as plan-oriented. Water planning can also revolve around the partic- ipation, communication, advocacy and transaction practices that take place within national water councils, local water boards, river basin councils, joint waters commissions and other institutional settings where water-related problems and solu-tions are discussed, adopted, implemented and reviewed. In this case, water planning can be con- sidered as process-oriented. Water planning does not always produce water plans intended as standalone documents. Water plans can be called in different manners. Plan is the generic term. The most typical alterna- tive titles are vision, blueprint, strategy, master plan, roadmap and program, from the most concise and generic kind of document to the longest and mo st specific one. Visions or strategies usually contain a description and analysis of the existing situation, identify the major problems and set goals that, if achieved, are meant to solve these problems. They may provide some examples of significant measures to achieve these goals, but they do not normally identify all specific measures that are necessary. Strategies and particularly vi sions are usually more political, as they may in- clude choices that reflect a specific preference fo r society (Fernandez et al 2014). Plans and pro- grams tend to be more technical. A master plan or program is more operational and usually con- tains concrete measures that are supposed to be necessary and sufficient to achieve strategic goals. However, the term program is often reserved for a set of measures, usually in the form of projects, that are meant to solve one of the majo r problems identified within a plan. A roadmap normally presents measures, including programs, in a sequential manner. In this case, the assump- tion is that the timing of measur es is particularly important to ac hieve the expected results. River contracts are a specific kind of plan, where main water users and other key stakeholders agree to take specific responsibilities and implement concrete measures, sometimes in exchange of finan- cial compensation. There are many specific plans dealing with different water-related issues (Fig. 2). At the national, regional and basin level, there are irrigation and dr ainage plans, hydropower plans, industrial wa- ters plans, plans on water-related disasters, wate r quality plans, groundwater plans, estuary plans and coastal water plans, just to mention the most common ones. There are also generic plans on IWRM or water efficiency that try to deal with water resources in a holistic manner. In recent years, there is a push towards source-to-sea planning to prevent issues of land-based sources of marine pollution. At the national, regional, district and lo cal level, there are plans on drinking water supply and sanitation, water safety plans, most plans on water-related disasters such as flooding and draught (Hartmann and Driessen 2017), as well as rainwater plans. These plans are rarely at the basin level, as they focus more on the communities that need drinking water supply and sanitation and that need to be protected from water- related disasters than on water flows. FFig. planning 2: Types of issue-specific plans 3. The cycle of water planning There is no one-size-fits-all in water planning. Howe ver, if one was to identify an ideal-typical cycle of water planning (Fig. 3), it would start with the building a balanced team and with the framing of the problem-shed. This is usually done by the au thority responsible for water management at the relevant level, typically the ministry in charge of water resources at the national level, the river basin authority at the basin level or the department respon sible for water services at the local level. Team- building and problem framing are important, because they introduce a relational and political bias in the process and may compromise the acceptabil ity and, ultimately, legitimacy of the planning exercise. The teams responsible for water planning are usually called drafting committees, working groups or task forces and they may include one or more lead authors, experts in different water- related issues, technical assistants, as well as support staff.

This in- cludes the legal and policy framework, a stakeholder analysis, as well as the identification of the geographical scope, time horizon, including a defi nition of short, medium and long-term, and rele- vant sectors. The information base also implies da ta collection and visualization, particularly in the form of maps and atlases. This may include survey s of expert opinion, particularly of key issues, and public opinion, particularly of water users. If data is sufficiently reliable and complete, this may allow some modeling and simulations of water flow (Tidwell et al 2004; Yates et al 2005). The identification of a tendential scenario, as well as two to four alternative scenarios, may then help to deal with uncertainty (Snover et al 2003; St raton et al 2011; Fernandez et al 2014). These sce- narios may be taken from national sources, such as national de velopment strategies or adapted from international sources, such as five styliz ed scenarios for water resources (Gallop\u00edn 2012) or the five shared socioeconomic pathways frequently used in climate-related research (Van Vuuren et al 2014). Scenarios are important to identify me asures that are commensurate with likely future development paths. Diagnostic analysis is the typical next step in wate r planning. This implies the identification of major and minor problems that require action. These issu es must then be analyzed based on the infor- mation collected. Hypotheses about the di- rect and indirect causes of these problems can thus be formulated. Diagnostic analysis can benefit from the participation of water users, particularly for the identification of specific issues and potential causes. Goal setting is normally considered the core element of water planning. It implies envi- sioning the problem solved and eventually intermediary goals. These goals may take the form of targets when they correspond to a specific figure or range. The credibility of these targets depends on the reliability of the information base, sound analysis, as well as trust in the governance system. Goals are strategic in the sense that they indicate an overall direction for water man-agement without detailing how the goals will be achieved or how contingencies will be dealt with. Water planning usually extends to the indi- cation of the measures that are expected to achieve goals. These measures shall be sufficient and necessary. They include reg- ulation, such as legal instruments and pol-icy guidelines, economic instruments, such as taxes, subsidies, quotas and exchangea-ble permits, communication instruments, as well as direct implementation, including both manmade and nature-based solu- tions. However, solutions are usually a mix of different kinds of measures, which are meant to be complementary and reinforce each other. FFig. 4: TTypical components of a wwater plan A.

Annexes Data tables Indicators Timeframe, milestones Financing plan Sustainability assessment Gender assessment Glossary, bibliography 1476 Water plans usually include many other important el ements. Data tables collect the data contained in the plan and other relevant data. Indicators are measurable elements that can signal whether a goal or target was achieved or not. Indicators may coincide with some SDG indicators. Timeframes represent the goals and measures contained in th e plan in a chronological manner and may help ensure that goals and measures follow a logical order. They may indicate milestones, which consist in significant goals that are expected to be ac hieved under the plan, on whose achievement other goals may depend. Because of the SDGs, 2030 is a common time horizon or milestone for many recent planning exercises. In some cases, water pl ans and especially programs also include financ- ing plans, presenting estimates about the cost of the measures proposed to achieve the stated goals. Water plans may contain various kinds of impact assessments, particularly on cross-cutting issues such as sustainability and gender. Finally, plans may include a glossary of key terms and sometimes a bibliography of key sources. Once draft plans are completed, they enter approv al iteration. At the national level, plans are usu- ally developed under the auspices of one or more government agencies. The first step normally involves consultation with other government agen cies through written correspondence and coordi- nation meetings. Parliamentary committees in charge of water and related issues may also be con- sulted. The same goes for representatives of local authorities, possibly through their representative assemblies, if they exist. Water plans typically un dergo some form of public hearing or at least consultation with water users, possibly through wa ter user associations or federations thereof. Con- sultations normally require several iterations between government, parliament, local authorities and sometimes water users. These iterations may ta ke months if not years. As soon as the water plan is sufficiently consensual or at least the choi ces to be made are clear, the plan is adopted by the competent authority, which may be the ministry in charge of water through a directive or, more frequently, through a decision of the council of minist ers, given the intersectoral nature of water. In this regard, the role of the prime minister and his office can be crucial to ensure interministerial coordination. The process is similar at the basin and at other subnational levels, as well as in trans- boundary contexts, all differences considered. The implementation of strategic plans is not mech anic. They sometime require the development of specific programs and action plans that were identi fied by the plan as priority actions or areas of intervention. These are further planning documents. Contingencies may also emerge that require adaptation to or deviation from the water plan thro ugh tactical measures that were not foreseen by the plan, such in the case of a major budgetary cr isis or water-related disaster. For this reason, plans or the decisions that adopt plans often establ ish an implementation unit that is responsible for the daily follow-up to the plan. National, regional or basin-level water councils may also contrib- ute to the process of constant revision and adapta tion of the plan by increasing the number of stakeholders involved, giving them a voice. With out such institutional arrangements, water plans often remain a paper in a drawer that may repres ent a learning experience for those who contrib- uted to its preparation, but with limited impact beyond them and perhaps those around them. This can also happen willingly, for example if the govern ment considers that measures contained in the water plan are not applicable. Plans require regular monitoring and evaluation, as well as revisions. The plan can appoint a re- sponsible entity for the monitoring and the evaluation of the implementation of the plan. It is advis- able that this is not the implementation unit, because of obvious conflict of interest. It may be another government agency, an external observat ory or a service provider. However, a well-func- tioning institutional setup with an active water council may be preferable, because more transpar- ent and responsive. External monitoring and evalua tion may in fact be bureaucratic and untimely. Water plans usually provide a clear time horizon afte r which a plan is expected to be revised. This may also be the case vis-\u00e0-vis some significant changes to the situation on the ground. Plans may contribute to the design of institutional setups that constantly update the information and knowledge base for water planning, that are capable to seize opportunities for water development, 1487 to take preventive measures against future threat s through risk reduction and to react in case of significant changes and water-related disasters. As such, water planning can be a contribution to achieve so-called adaptive governance (Groves et al 2015). 4. The relationship between water plans and other documents The relationship between water plans among themselves and among other legal and policy docu- ments, such as spatial plans, can be complicated (Fig. 5 and 6). In case of inconsistency, which one prevails? Water plans usually have a low level of legal bindingness. As such, they are more policy documents than legal ones. Like for many policy documents, the exact relationship among plans may be undetermined, leaving it up to poli cymakers and in some cases courts to use them or not. In some planning sys- tems, the relationship among planning documents may be such that lower level plans pre-vail over higher level ones, based on the principle of speci- ficity. This bottom-up approach is more likely to be found in de-centralized political systems. The opposite can also be found, meaning that higher level plans may trump lower level ones. This top-down approach is more typi- cal of centralized systems. A hy- brid option is that lower level plans need to wait for the approval of higher level plans and then must take them into consideration, but not necessar ily conform. Another similar hybrid solution is that lower level plans need to be submitted to higher level authorities for consideration, usually within a specific timeframe, without being required to follow the advice received. Uncoordinated and hybrid approaches are quite common.

In most countrie s and in most situations, special uses of water are subject to the request of permits, sometimes al so in the context of building permits. In the legislation, the issuance of permits may be subject to conformity not only with the laws in force, but also with water plans and other planning document s. In many cases, plans are at least taken into consideration by public authorities for the issuance of permits. Permits can also be subject to ap- peal in court both from other public authorities, which may challenge the legal grounds of the deci- sion to issue or not permits, and, provided suffici ent publicity is given to issued permits and to the issuing process, also by other users, neighbors and interested parties. Moreover, permits pay a key role for the monitoring of the use of water reso urces and are a key component of water information systems and knowledge bases. 5. Public participation in water planning Like in other planning and environmental domains, public participation in water-related planning and decision-making is important. It enlarges the knowledge base, includes the perspectives of those who are usually left behind, particularly mi norities and the poor, and prevents conflicts of use. It is also a key component of IWRM, includin g in its gender dimension. However, public partic- ipation in planning, including water planning, has been object of scrutiny and some criticism for decades (Wengert 1971). The main issue is repres entation of interests and stakeholders. Areas covered by water systems are often large with a high number of inhabitants and stakeholders with sometimes divergent actual and perceived interests. How to make sure that they are and feel rep-resented? Intermediary organizations, such as wa ter user associations and non-governmental or- ganizations play an important role in this regard, as elected officials are usually the expression of a majority of the population and do not always fu lly represent minority interests. Therefore, the national, regional, basin and district level particip ation is usually indirect. Direct participation is normally effective only in small communities. Ther e is evidence showing that public participation may improve the quality of water pl anning (Graversgaard et al 2017). Most forms of public partici- pation increase the duration of planning processe s and lead to necessary tradeoffs among different interests (Mooney et al 2012). Co-production of water planning usually takes place between policymakers and experts. Larger companies, such as water service providers, large NGOs and water user associations may also be involved in this process. It is normally recommended to consult and elicit the opinion of the general population, smaller companies and grassroots NGOs through interviews and household surveys. It is important to keep the population informed of existing problems and potential solutions through appropriate means of communication. Examples include local newspapers, brochures, posters, lo- cal radio stations and social media. It is also of strategic importance to ensure as much access as possible to water-related information. 6. Challenges to water planning First of all, there is no global or regional repository, observatory or documentation center of basin plans and planning. Many plans, pa rticularly those at the national level, are increasingly available online. The existence at least of a repository would help better understand the phenomenon and encourage comparative analysis. Second, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of water plan-ning. Planning has been oftentimes criticized as ineffective, in the sense that plans are rarely fol- lowed to the letter (Millard-Ball 2013). This phenom enon is typical of policy documents that, unlike legal ones, are meant to guide action in a certain direction more than to enact specific rules or other measures. Planning processes are also opportunities for key stakeholders to communicate about strategic priorities on water resources, wh ich is already an outcome per se, regardless of whether they lead to a planning document or not and whether this document is respected or not. Another frequent issue is the definition of the sc ope of water planning: some basins or cities can 1509 be too big for a single water plan, others can be too small. Moreover, basins, just like settlements, can always be assembled into larger units and broken down into smaller ones. On the content side, the major challenge is currently integration. First, the integration of adaptation to climate change into water plans (White et al 2006; Gober et al 2010; Gober 2013; Grafton 2014; Hurlimann and Wilson 2018) and, in general, the issue of adaptive planning (Groves 2015), mean-ing the capacity of planning to anticipate change in a context of uncertainty. The role of science and other kinds of knowledge in water planning is of great importance to increase the resilience of water systems. Second, the integration of so-called blue, gray and green water in water planning. This includes the reduction, recycle and reuse of industrial sewage in a context of circular economy and the water absorbed by soil, trees and other kinds of vegetation for rainwater management (Falkenmark and Rockstr\u00f6m 2006; Woltjer 2007). Th ird, the integration of water planning from source to sea, including groundwater. This is impo rtant in coastal areas for the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources and to deal with issues such as the infiltration of seawater into freshwater water bodies both on the surface and under the ground. Finally, the role of science, expertise and other kinds of knowledge, such as traditional and indige- nous knowledge, but also everyday knowledge, needs to be further explored, particularly in its in- teraction with policymaking. Water management is often considered as a highly technical issue that is normally better dealt with by water engineers and other specialists. However, water planning is often political, as it implies prioritizing certain actions and their beneficiaries over others, some- times leaving some parts of the population behi nd. To help reduce the knowledge gap between science and policymaking and also to depoliticize some choices, decision-support systems were developed based on more or less sophisticated modeling of water flows and human behavior (Loucks and Costa 1991; Andreu et al 1996). However, they are rarely used. More recently, the diffusion of networked metering systems and the emergence of automatic canals and other water- related systems, potentially supported by machine learning and other \"smart\" solutions, is autom- atizing many routine management decisions (Stewa rt et al 2010). This has a potential impact on water planning in both cities and basins, as it extends the knowledge base and reduces potentially conflictual water management decisions, removing the human agency behind. At the same time, it crystalizes existing settings and routines in non-human systems, perhaps blurring the embedded political choices behind.
