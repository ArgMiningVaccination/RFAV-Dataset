A man owned two dogs that were always fighting each other. One day a friend asked the man, \"Which dog usually wins the fight?\" The man answered, \"The dog I feed the most.\" Inside every Christian are two different natures; two ways of thinking and acting. One is the old sinful nature and the other is the new spiritual nature. Check it out in Galatians 5:16-26 So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. So, there is the Spirit Nature, and the Sinful or Flesh Nature. Paul continues, explaining the difference between the two ... The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. Like the two dogs at the beginning, we have two natures that are always fighting (v.17). When the sinful nature is winning the fight, we do all the horrible stuff listed in verse 19-21. Recognize any of these in your own life? I can, which is a bit depressing. When the new spiritual nature is winning the fight, we do all the cool stuff in verse 22-23, Recognize any of these in your life? I hope you can. Winning the fight So, which dog, I mean which nature, usually wins the fight? Well that depends on which one you feed the most. If you are always feeding the sinful nature by exposing yourself to sinful actions, engaging in sin, only surround yourself with sinful influences and peers, your sinful nature will grow strong and win. However, if you walk by the Spirit, live by the spirit and keep in step with the Spirit, surrounding yourself with the Spirit's truth (the Bible), the Spirit's people (other Christians), follow the Spirit's focus (Jesus), and pray in the Spirit (to God the Father), your new spiritual nature will grow strong and win. Which nature do you feed the most? Is your sinful nature growing big and strong? Are you feeding it too much? Finding the Christian life pretty difficult at the moment? Do you need to put your sinful nature on a diet? Is your spiritual nature a bit malnourished? Haven't been feeding it much lately? Does it need a good three course meal? Which nature do you feed the most? Which nature "}
