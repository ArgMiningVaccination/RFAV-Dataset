Classical music can be the perfect accompaniment to meditation, mindfulness and yoga. Since the beginning of history, humans have used music as an aid to meditation, prayer and yoga: from Gregorian chants written 500 years ago to [Arvo P\u00e4rt](/composers/part/)'s haunting minimalist music written just a few years ago. Classical music in particular has been found to be profoundly [relaxing](/discover-music/mood/relaxing/music-relaxation/). So we've put together a list of the very best music for meditation. There's something from almost every era of music, because no matter what changes in music, people always need moments of stillness. We hope you find something that works for you. Listen on Global Player: [Inner Harmony with Dr Alex George, our live playlist dedicated to the benefits of classical music](https://www.globalplayer.com/playlists/2SWkA/) The Estonian composer's most popular piece is deeply calming. Its title translates as 'Mirror in the Mirror', making it most appropriate for a moment of reflection.

Alexis Ffrench - Radiate Sandstr\u00f6m is known for his wild Motorbike Concerto for trombone, but this piece is altogether more ethereal, literally stretching out a work by 16th-century German composer Praetorius into something celestial. Jan Sandstr\u00f6m - Det \u00e4r en ros utsprungen Taken from [Richter](/composers/richter/)'s Sleep an eight hour long work, designed to accompany an entire night's rest. If you can stay awake you'll find it can equally bring deep serenity. Max Richter - Dream 3 (in the midst of my life) The title to this beautiful, lilting piano piece translates as 'moonlight'. [Debussy](/composers/debussy/) was inspired by a poem by Paul Verlaine, which begins, \"Your soul is a chosen landscape...\" That's worth meditating upon. Debussy - Clair de Lune on LED piano Tavener gave instructions to the performers of this piece to play very, very quietly \"at the threshold of audibility.\" Let those handbells resonate deep within your soul. TAVENER: The Last Sleep of the Virgin/HILDEGARD: O eterne deus A Christmas song telling the story of Christ's birth, [Lauridsen](/composers/lauridsen/)'s 1994 choral masterpiece is a work of profound sensitivity and spirituality. S:t Jacobs Ungdomsk\u00f6r - O Magnum Mysterium by Morten Lauridsen Enjoy this complete album of piano music by [Erik Satie](/composers/satie/), the perfect way to relax for a longer meditation session. Erik Satie - Gnossienne No. 1 Piano and atmospheric electronics combine to make this enervating piece from [Newman](/composers/newman/)'s soundtrack to American Beauty a favourite among Classic FM listeners. Any Other Name Stanford's setting of Mary Coleridge's poem is a miniature gem: the soaring soprano line lifts you into a transcendent realm. Stanford The Bluebird For a brief few moments of mindfulness, try Satie's alternating progression of two major seventh chords - G and D. Sweet, melancholic and just the tonic. Erik Satie - Gymnop\u00e9die No. 1 [Eric Whitacre](/composers/whitacre/)'s touching piece is based on a short Christmas poem which reads, \"Light, warm and heavy as pure gold, and the angels sing softly to the new born baby.\" Simply sublime. Light and Gold: Lux Aurumque - Eric Whitacre Concluding where we began, in the world of minimalism, [Philip Glass](/composers/glass/)'s haunting climax to his opera about Gandhi is pure musical mesmerism.
