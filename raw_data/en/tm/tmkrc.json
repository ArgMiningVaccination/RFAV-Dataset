ACOG r ecommends that CO VID-19 v accines should not be withheld fr om pr egnant individuals who meet criteria for v accination based on A CIP-r ecommended priority gr oups. COVID-19 v accines should be off ered to lactating individuals similar t o non-lactating individuals when the y meet criteria for r eceipt of the v accine based on prioritization gr oups outlined b y the ACIP. Individuals considering a CO VID-19 v accine should ha ve access t o available information about the saf ety and e\u0000cacy of the v accine, including information about data that ar e not a vailable.

On December 2, 2020 the A CIP v oted t o recommend that health car e work ers and long-term car e facility r esidents be prioritiz ed for v accination in the initial yment of CO VID-19 v accine (Phase 1a) ( CDC 2020 ). As the availability of v accine becomes mor e robust, A CIP will expand these r ecommendations t o include additional priority populations (Phase 1b and Phase 1c). On December 12, 2020, after an explicit, e vidence-based r eview of all a vailable data, the Advisor y Committee on Immunization Pr actices (A CIP) issued an interim r ecommendation for use of the P\u0000z er- BioN Tech CO VID-19 v accine in persons aged 16 years for the pr evention of CO VID-19 ( CDC 2020 ). Following this v ote, CDC r eleased an MMWR outlining the r ecommendations. Additional clinical consider ations de veloped b y ACIP for the use of the v accine in speci\u0000c populations, including pr egnant and lactating individuals, will be posted on the CDC' s website shor tly. Within these clinical consider ations, it is expected that r egar ding pr egnancy , CDC will state that a pr egnant individual who is par t of a gr oup (e.g., healthcar e personnel) r ecommended t o receiv e a CO VID-19 v accine ma y choose t o be v accinated. A discussion with their healthcar e provider can help the patient mak e an informed decision. F urther, regar ding lactation, it is expected that CDC will state that lactating individuals who ar e par t of a gr oup (e.g., healthcar e personnel) r ecommended t o receiv e a CO VID-19 v accine ma y choose t o be v accinated. U.S. FD A Emer gency Use A uthorization and Appr oval On December 11, 2020, the U.S. F ood and Drug Administr ation (FD A) issued an Emer gency Use Authorization for the P\u0000z er-BioNtech mRN A vaccine (BN T162b2) for use in individuals age 16 years and older as a 2-dose r egimen giv en 3 weeks apar t.

The EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and Car egivers states \"If y ou ar e pregnant or breastf eeding, discuss y our options with y our healthcar e provider \". The EU A authority allows the FD A to str engthen the nation 's public health pr otections against chemical, biological, r adiological, and nuclear (CBRN) thr eats b y facilitating the a vailability and use of medical countermeasur es needed during public health emer gencies. 12/14/2020 Vaccinating .acog.org/en/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-Pregnant-and-Lactating-Patients-Against-COVID-19 5/16Under section 564 of the F eder al Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the FD A Commissioner ma y allow unappr oved medical pr oducts or unappr oved uses of appr oved medical pr oducts t o be used in an emer gency t o diagnose, tr eat, or pr event serious or lif e-thr eatening diseases or conditions caused b y CBRN thr eat agents when ther e are no adequate, oved, and a vailable alternativ es (FDA 2017 ). Data on the saf ety and eff ectiv eness of the v accine(s) continues t o be collected during the EU A period. (FDA, 2017 ). Vaccine Information and Recommendations At the time of this publication, one v accine de veloped for the pr evention of CO VID-19 has r eceiv ed EU A from the FD A. Howe ver, COVID-19 v accines ar e rapidly emer ging and additional EU As ar e likely to materializ e. ACOG will striv e to update this guidance as quickly as possible while maintaining accur ate, evidence-based information. mRN A CO VID-19 V accines The de velopment and use of mRN A vaccines is r elativ ely new . These v accines consist of messenger RN A (mRN A) encapsulated b y a lipid nanopar ticle (LNP) for deliv ery into the host cells. These v accines utiliz e the body 's own cells t o gener ate the cor onavirus spik e protein (the r elevant antigens), which, similar t o all other v accines, stimulates immune cells t o create antibodies against CO VID-19. The mRN A vaccines ar e not liv e virus v accines, nor do the y use an adjuv ant t o enhance v accine e\u0000cacy . These v accines do not enter the nucleus and do not alter human DN A in v accine r ecipients. As a r esult, mRN A vaccines cannot cause any genetic changes ( CDC , Zhang 2019 , Schlak e 2012 ). Based on the mechanism of action of these v accines and the demonstr ated saf ety and e\u0000cacy in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, it is expected that the saf ety and e\u0000cacy pr o\u0000le of the v accine for pr egnant individuals would be similar t o that obser ved in non-pr egnant individuals. That said, ther e are no saf ety data speci\u0000c t o mRN A vaccine use in pr egnant or lactating individuals and the potential risks t o a pr egnant individual and the f etus ar e unknown.

Pregnancy Consider ations Despite A COG' s persistent adv ocacy for the inclusion of pr egnant individuals in CO VID-19 v accine trials, none of the CO VID-19 v accines appr oved under EU A ha ve been tested in pr egnant individuals. Howe ver, studies in pr egnant women ar e planned. Data fr om De velopmental and Repr oductiv e Toxicity (D ART) studies for the P\u0000z er-BioNtech CO VID-19 v accine ar e anticipated in mid-December , accor ding t o the manufactur er. From what has been communicated so far r egar ding these for thcoming data, ther e ha ve not been any major saf ety signals identi\u0000ed. These animal model studies pr ovide the \u0000rst saf ety data t o help inform the futur e of clinical trials in pr egnancy .

ACOG Recommendations Pregnant Individuals ACOG r ecommends that CO VID-19 v accines should not be withheld fr om pr egnant individuals who meet criteria for v accination based on A CIP-r ecommended priority gr oups. While saf ety data on the use of COVID-19 v accines in pr egnancy ar e not curr ently a vailable, ther e are also no data t o indicate that the vaccines should be contr aindicated, and no saf ety signals gener ated fr om D ART studies for the P\u0000z er- BioNtech v accine. Ther efore, in the inter est of allowing pr egnant individuals who would other wise be consider ed a priority population for a v accine appr oved for use under EU A, mak e their own decisions regar ding their health, A COG r ecommends that pr egnant individuals should be fr ee to mak e their own decision inconjunction with their clinical careteam12/14/2020 Vaccinating Pregnant and Lactating Patients Against COVID-19 | ACOG https://www .acog.org/en/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-Pregnant-and-Lactating-Patients-Against-COVID-19 7/16decision in conjunction with their clinical car e team. Individuals considering a CO VID-19 v accine should ha ve access t o available information about the saf ety and e\u0000cacy of the v accine, including information about data that ar e not a vailable. A conv ersation between the patient and their clinical team ma y assist with decisions r egar ding the use of v accines appr oved under EU A for the pr evention of CO VID-19 b y pregnant patients. Impor tant consider ations include the le vel of activity of the pandemic in the community , the potential e\u0000cacy of the v accine, the potential risk and se verity of maternal disease, including the eff ects of disease on the f etus and newborn, and the saf ety of the v accine for the pr egnant patient and the f etus. While a conv ersation with a clinician may be helpful, it should not be r equir ed prior t o vaccination as this ma y cause unnecessar y barriers t o access. Clinicians should r eview the a vailable data on risks and bene\u0000ts of v accination with pr egnant patients, including the risks of not getting v accinated in the context of the individual patient' s curr ent health status, and risk of exposur e, including the possibility for exposur e at work or home and the possibility for exposing high-risk household members. Conv ersations about risk should tak e in t o account the individual patient' s values and per ceived risk of v arious outcomes and should r espect suppor t aut onomous decision-making ( ACOG 2013 ). Pregnant women who experience f ever following v accination should be counseled t o tak e acetaminophen, as f ever has been associated with adv erse pr egnancy outcomes. Acetaminophen has been pr oven to be saf e for use in pr egnancy and does not appear t o impact antibody r esponse t o CO VID- 19 vaccines. Pregnant patients who decline v accination should be suppor ted in their decision. Regar dless of their decision t o receiv e or not r eceiv e the v accine, these conv ersations pr ovide an oppor tunity t o remind about the impor tance of other pr evention measur es such as hand washing, physical distancing, and wearing a mask. Lactating Individuals ACOG r ecommends CO VID-19 v accines be off ered to lactating individuals similar t o non-lactating individuals when the y meet criteria for r eceipt of the v accine based on prioritization gr oups outlined b y the A CIP. While lactating individuals wer e not included in most clinical trials, CO VID-19 v accines should not be withheld fr om lactating individuals who other wise meet criteria for v accination. Theor etical concerns r egar ding the saf ety of v accinating lactating individuals do not .acog.org/en/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-Pregnant-and-Lactating-Patients-Against-COVID-19 8/16of receiving the v accine. Ther e is no need t o avoid initiation or discontinue br eastf eeding in patients who receiv e a CO VID-19 v accine. Individuals Contemplating Pr Vaccination is str ongly encour for gr oup(s). Further, ACOG r ecommends v accination of individuals who ar e activ ely tr ying t o become pr egnant or ar e contemplating pr egnancy and meet the criteria for v accination based on A CIP prioritization recommendations. Additionally , it is not necessar y to dela y pregnancy after completing both doses of the COVID-19 v accine. If an individual becomes pr egnant after the \u0000rst dose of the CO VID-19 v accine series, the second dose should be administer ed as indicated. If an individual r eceiv es a CO VID-19 v accine and becomes pr egnant within 30 da ys of r eceipt of the v accine, par ticipation in CDC' s V-SAFE pr ogram should be encour aged (see below for mor e information on CDC' s V-SAFE pr ogram). Impor tantly , routine pr egnancy testing is not r ecommended prior t o receiving a CO VID-19 v accine. Health E quity Consider ations and Racial and Ethnic Minority Gr oups Racial and ethnic minority gr oups ha ve been dispr opor tionately aff ected b y the CO VID-19 pandemic. Individuals in r acial and ethnic minority gr oups ar e mor e likely to ha ve severe illness and e ven die fr om COVID-19 lik ely due t o a r ange of social and structur al fact ors including disparities in socioeconomic status, access t o car e, rates of chr onic conditions, and occupational exposur e, systemic r acism, and historic and continued inequities in the health car e system.

Addr essing health equity during the CO VID- 19 pandemic. P osition Statement. W ashingt CO VID-19 v accines, exists among all populations. When communicating with patients it is extr emely impor tant t o underscor e the gener al saf ety of v accines and emphasiz e the fact that no steps wer e skipped in the de velopment and e valuation of CO VID-19 v accines. This can be done b y brie\u0000y highlighting the saf ety r equir ements of v accines, and ongoing saf ety monit oring e ven after v accines ar e made a vailable. The following ar e some messages t o consider using when discussing CO VID-19 v accines with patients: Vaccines ar e one of the gr eatest public health achie vements of the 20th centur y. Befor e the widespr ead use of v accines, people r outinely died fr om inf ectious diseases, se veral of which ha ve since been eradicated thanks t o robust immunization pr ograms. Several vaccines ha ve saf ely been giv en to pregnant and lactating individuals for decades. The rigor of CO VID-19 v accine clinical trials with r egar ds to monit oring saf ety and e\u0000cacy meet the same high standar ds and r equir ements as with a typical v accine appr oval pr ocess. While ther e has been a worldwide attempt t o de velop CO VID-19 v accines r apidly , this does not mean that any saf ety standar ds ha ve been r elaxed. In fact, ther e are additional saf ety monit oring systems t o track and monit or these v accines, including r eal-time assessment. Side eff ects such as in\u0000uenza-lik e-illness can be expected with these v accines, howe ver this is a normal r eaction as the body de velops antibodies t o protect itself against CO VID-19. CO VID-19 vaccines cannot cause CO VID-19 inf ection. It is impor tant not t o be dissuaded b y these side effects, because in or der t o get the maximum pr otection against CO VID-19, patients need two doses of the v accine. Safety monit oring continues well be yond the EU A administr ation. CDC' s smar tphone-based after-v accination health check er for people r eceiv e CO VID-19 v accines. V -SAFE will use text messaging and web sur veys from CDC t o check in with v accine r ecipients for health pr oblems following CO VID-19 vaccination.
