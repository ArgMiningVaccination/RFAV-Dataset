Lung Transplant Program Page 3 MEDICAL MANAGEMENT Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 4 Precautions You will receive medications that are necessary to prevent your body from rejecting your new lungs. These drugs decrease your body's ability to fight infections. You will be assigned to a private room while in the hospital. These are specially designed rooms with filters built in to protect you from infections, and to your exposure to other people. You will be on \"precautions.\" This means that everyone entering your room will wear a mask, gown, and gloves, for at least 7 days after your transplant. Your visitors are limited to immediate family or significant others during this time. Anyone with a cold, flu or any ailment that could put you at risk for infection will not be allowed to go into the room. Flowers and fruit baskets will not be allowed in your room. Good hand washing is the m ost effective way to stop the spread of bacteria and prevent infection. This includes family, hospital staff, all visitors, as well as yourself. Your nurse can instruct you and your family on proper hand washing. When you leave your room for any reason, you must wear a mask. Chest Tubes and Pleural Drains After transplant , you will have multiple tubes attached to your chest draining excess fluid from around your lung(s). This will in turn help your new lungs re -expand in your chest and h elp you to breathe better. Some people go home with these drains still in place as it is perfectly safe and manageable. At home you will be responsible for draining th e fluid as directed and record ing the amount drain ed, as well as the color of the fluid . The accuracy of these numbers will help to determine when these drains can be removed. Prior to leaving the hospital, your nurse will go over how to drain, measure, and record the amount of fluid. Also, when you get home, your Visiting Nurse will be able to help you to initially ma nage and answer questions you may have about the drains. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 5 Respiratory Care For lung optimi zation, it is important for you to COUGH, WALK , and DEEP BREATHE. These are essential for expansion of your new lung/s. A nurse or respiratory therapist will visit you two to three times a day. He/she listens to your lungs and performs chest physical therapy (CPT). CPT consists of tapping and vibrating your chest while you lay in different positions in bed. CPT also involves teac hing you to take deep breaths and cough effectively. You will receive CPT frequently from both the therapists and the nurses taking care of you. The respiratory therapist and the nurse will help you to walk three to five times every day. As you recover, you will walk independently. The more you walk, the more you increase the blood supply to your new lung, and the stronger you become! This will prove to be the most important aspect of your recovery and will be given the priority it demands. Physical Therapy Physical therapy will begin as early as 1 -2 days after your surgery. The goal of physical therapy is to improve your movement, increase your functioning and relieve pain. This is essential to your recovery after y our transplant. It will assist you in preventing pulmonary complications and the side effects of your medications that can cause muscle weakness. The therapist will first evaluate your strength, coordination, range of motion, pain, breathing techniques, and mobility. The therapist will carefully monitor your cardiopulmonary status (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation), during activity. Initially you will have many lines (I.V.'s, heart monitor, chest tubes, epidural). The nurse and therapist will assist you in moving with all above mentioned lines. At thi s time, you will be started on an individualized exercise program, which will progress rapidly from in bed to sitting and finally standing. This will assist you in increasi ng your strength and endurance. Activity will help you in clearing your secretions as well as improving your breathing pattern. Once you can get out of bed and are walking short distan ces, you will begin an exercise program and be monitored throug hout your individualized program . It is expected that you participate daily to help prevent pulmonary complications and expedite your discharge to home. Your goals prior to discharge will be to be out of bed during the day, to walk and climb stairs indepe ndently , and to have a well -established exercise program. By the time of discharge, we anticipate you will be independent in all routine activities of daily living, independent in walking to allow you to get to your appointments, and able to climb the stairs. You will have an exercise program designed for you to continue at home every day. If you are not fully independent in these activities, you may require a transition to an inpatient rehab facility for to continue working on these goals. We have selec ted a few local facilities and have trained them to care for our transplant patients . Following discharge, you will be expected to follow up with outpatient rehab to continue with your rehab program once you have recovered from transplant. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 6 Prevention of Blood Clots Blood clots are extremely common following lung transplant surgery and can lead to further complications including pulmonary embolism , a blood clot in your lung . To prevent these complications early ambulation is essential. Ano ther measure we take to prevent blood clots is to give an injectable blood thinning medication called enoxaparin (Lovenox). You will work with your nurse to learn how to self-inject this medication prior to discharge. Most patients require this medicatio n for appro ximately 1-month post-transplant . Should you have any procedures while you are on this medication, please as k for instructions regarding stopp ing this medication prior to your procedure. Diabetes Some of the medications you take after transplant may cause diabetes. Diabetes is an increased level of sugar in the blood. During your hospital stay your blood sugars will be closely monitored and most patients will be discharged home with a glucometer and injectable insulin to continue to m onitor and treat elevated blood sugars . Signs of diabetes may include: 1. excessive thirst 2. increased urination 3. blurred vision 4. confusion Call your transplant team if you have any of these signs. Early detection can result in reversal or reduction of h igh blood sugar. In some cases, blood sugar can be reduced by weight loss, careful diet, and exercise. You may need an oral diabetes drug or insulin injections. If you get diabetes, you will be given special teaching about how to deal with this problem. If you do go home with the instructions to measure your blood sugars, please record each reading in your diary and bring them with you to clinic . It is important we are monitoring those numbers so we can adjust your medications appropriately. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 7 Post-Transplant Bone Health One common side effect after having a transplant is a condition called osteoporosis. This condition can also be referred to as \"thinning of the bones.\" This is caused by the medications you are required to take that suppress your immu ne system. To prevent osteoporosis, maintain a diet rich in calcium, found in milk, dairy products, and dark green leafy vegetables. After transplant, you will take supplemental calcium and vitamin D, unless contra -indicated. Regular weight bearing exercise, such as walking, will help to prevent osteoporosis as it promotes bone growth. After discharge most patients will be schedule d to receive an infusion called \"Reclast \" to help build bone strength while on h igh doses of prednisone. Reclast is given once a year. If a transplant team member recommends you receive this infusion you will be able to receive the infusion here at BWH or at your home hospital. If your insurance does not approve this medication, you will receive and oral alternative. You will also have routine bone mineral density tests to determine if you will need ongoing treatment and may also need to be referred to endocrine if more management is warranted. You will need to call and set -up your own infusion appointment at BWH outpatient infusion center p 617-732-9983 . When calling to schedule your appointment, you will need to give your name, medical record number, and the name of the medication: Reclast. Please speak with and inform your outpatient coordinator if you plan on scheduling your appo intment. Your coordinator information can be found on page 1 of this manual. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 8 Preventing Infection Follow ing Lung Transplantation : Frequently Asked Questions Why worry about infections ? After a lung transplant, you will need to take medications that prevent your body from rejecting your new lung(s). These medications are very important for you to take, but they can also make it harder for your body to fight off germs that cause infecti ons. There are some things that you can do to help keep from getting sick. Where do these infections come from? Some infections are caused by \"reactivation\" of viruses that have been in your body for years from past infections. These viruses usually don't cause problems until your immune system is weakened. Some examples include viruses that cause cold sores (Herpes simplex virus), shingles (Varicella zoster virus), and CMV infections such as pneumonia (cytomegalovirus). These viruses can also sometimes re activate in the transplanted lu ng and cause infections. You will receive medications to prevent reactivation of these viruses. Some infections are passed along to you by other people (such as influenza). Some infections come from germs from other things li ke food, animals, or dirt. How can I protect myself from infection? Stay healthy, get plenty of sleep, drink enough fluids and eat a balanced diet. Make sure that you follow all your lung transplant team's instructions for taking medications . If you have any questions about medications, please ask your lung transplant providers - they'll be happy to answer. Wash your hands often: o Washing your hands either with an alcohol -based han d sanitizer or with soap and water is very important to prevent infections. o Wash your hands when they are dirty and at the following times: Before preparing food to eat After touching raw meat like chicken or steak Before eating After using the restroom After changing a baby's diaper After touching animals such as dogs and cats After going outdoors or to a public place Before and after touching catheters or wounds Ask people who touch you to wash their hands . People can make you sick by bringing in germs fr om the outside. Don't be afraid to ask them to wash their hands. This includes doctors, nurses, other healthcare professionals, family members (including children), and visitors. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 9 Skin and mouth care: Some medication such as prednisone can increase your chance of getting skin and mouth infections. Shower daily, but do not scrub your incision while it is healing. If your skin becomes dry, use a lotion to soften your skin and prevent cracking (do not apply directly to your incision) . Brush your teeth. Use a soft toothbrush. If you are unable to brush your teeth, use an antibacterial mouth rinse such as Peridex. You will receive a mouth wash called nystatin to swish and swallow four times daily to prevent an infection called thrush while on high dose predniso ne. If you develop blisters or sores in your mouth, let your lung transplant team know. Check with your doctor before having dental work done. Clean cuts and scrapes with soap and water and cover with a bandage. Keep your living area clean: Before leaving the hospital, plan to clean where you will be staying. We recommend: Cleaning heating and air -conditioning vents and routinely changing the filters. Removing visible mold and mildew from bathrooms. Clean your house weekly, especially your s leeping area. This should include vacuuming carpets. It is best if you're not in the same room while this is going on; if you are, we suggest that you wear a mask during the cleaning. If you use a humidifier, clean it daily with a dilute solution of bleac h then rinse before refilling the water tank. Avoid poorly ventilated spaces such as unfinished basement areas and attics that can be moldy or dusty. If you must spend time in these places, wear a mask. Avoid smoke -filled environments. No fireplaces, cam pfires etc. Stay away from dirt and plants: Germs , such as mold and fungus are found in dirt and on plants. These germs can cause serious infections in persons with a weakened immune system that can be difficult to treat. No gardening or activities that stir up dirt such as turning soil, mulching, raking, or cutting grass for on e year after transplant . Stay indoors with the windows closed when these activities are going on. If yard work is unavoidable, a mask and gloves should be worn. It's unknown whether using a mask will protect you against these infections. Caution for what you eat and drink: Germs that cause infection can be in the food you eat. You need to be careful about how you prepare food. Here are some steps to keeping food safe: Clean: Wash hands, utensils, and surfaces with hot soapy water before and after food preparation, and especially after preparing meat, poultry, eggs or seafood. Be sure to wash fresh fruits and vegetables thoroughly. Don't share dishes, glasses or eating utensil s. Separate: Keep raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood away from ready -to-eat foods. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 10 Do not place cooked food on an unwashed plate where raw meat, poultry, eggs, or seafood has been. Cook: Cook foods thoroughly . Use a food thermometer to check the interna l temperature of meat. o Cook meat until it is no longer pink, and the juices run clear. o Cook eggs until they are firm (no runny yolk). o Bring sauces, soups, and gravies to a boil when reheating. o Avoid eating uncooked deli foods such as cold cuts. Chill: Keep cold foods cold. Refrigerate or freeze foods that may spoil. Refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours and make sure the refrigerator temperature is no higher than 40 F and the freezer temperature is 0 F. Never thaw food at room temperature, thaw food in the refrigerator or microwave . Municipal tap water is generally safe. Avoid well water if possible unless the water quality is tested frequently. Avoid unpasteurized milk , cheese, and vegetable or fruit juices. Pet safety: Pets are import ant to many people but can sometimes pass infections to humans. Make sure to talk to your doctor about pet safety. Do not handle animal waste. Don't clean litter boxes, animal cages, or fish tanks. Do not adopt sick or stray pets or pets less than 6 months old. Do not have birds or reptiles as pets during and after the transplantation. Travel: Your chance of getting an infection is higher in certain areas of world (including certain parts of the U.S.). Talk to your transplant team before traveling to see whether you need to take any special precautions. Avoid travel to areas of the world where you would be unable to receive special medical care for patients with weakened immune systems. Talk to your transplant team before receiving travel vaccinations. Some vaccines recommended for travel can't be given to transplant recipients. Don't buy food from sidewalk vendors. Depending on where you travel, it may be safest to drink only bottled carbonated beverages and to avoid ice cubes. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 11 Contact your transplant team if you develop any symptoms of infection: You should always feel free to call the team about your symptoms and they can determine whether you need evaluation or treatment. If you have any of these symptoms, call your transplant team: o Fever over 100.5 F o Cough, stuffy nose, scratchy throat, earache o Chest pain or shortness of breath o Diarrhea or vomiting lasting longer than 3 days , loss of appetite, weight loss o Chills, night sweats, o Skin rash o Mouth or genital sores o Difficulty or pain wit h urination o Dizziness or headache o Pain or redness at a wound or catheter site Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 12 Addressing Your General Healthcare Needs Health Maintenance: You should continue to see your primary care physician (PCP) yearly for routine physical examinations. You should also contact your PCP and local pulmonologist at or about 3 months after your transplant for follow -up and updating of your medical information. Your PCP and local pulmonologist are imp ortant resources for you and your transplant team, and we will rely on them to help us take care of you after your transplant. Prior to starting you on any new medication, your local physician should contact the transplant team to make sure the new medica tion will not interact with anything you are already taking. Women should undergo routine pelvic examinations with PAP smears with your local physician as recommended. You should perform breast self -examination monthly. You should also undergo yearly ma mmograms if age appropriate as recommended by your PCP. Men should perform monthly testicular self -exams. Prostate cancer screening if age appropriate should be performed as recommended by your PCP. Both men and women should undergo colon cancer screeni ng if age appropriate as recommended by your PCP. Skin Care: Transplant patients are at an increased risk for developing skin cancer because of sun exposure. Skin cancers are caused by the ultraviolet rays from the sun. These rays are present even when it is cloudy. Patients are instructed on the following steps to protect against harmful ultraviolet rays: Always wear sun block and lip block with a SPF of 30 or higher. Wear clothing that is protective, such a s hats and long-sleeved shirts. Wear sung lasses when outside during the day. Report any changes in your skin, such as a change in a mole or a wart, or appearance of any new growth. You should have a full body skin check performed annually by a dermatologist. Generally, you should shower or bat he as often as necessary to keep your skin clean. Most soaps are safe for use. Prednisone can cause acne on your face, chest, shoulders or back. Cyclosporine can make your skin oily. If acne develops, wash the area three times a day with mild soap, s crubbing gently with a clean, wet washcloth. Rinse the soap completely from your skin to leave it clean. Any benzoyl peroxide solution may be used. To prevent infection, do not pick at or touch the pimples. Report any acne that may be infected. The ac ne should clear as your prednisone dose is decreased. You may require treatment from a dermatologist if the acne is severe. To avoid acne: Keep your hands away from your face and avoid rubbing the area Limit the use of cosmetics Do not scrub your skin vi gorously Avoid soaps that contain creams and oils Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 13 Hair Care: Prednisone will probably change the condition of your hair. Permanent hair dyes, wave lotions and bleach may cause your hair to become brittle and break. It is recommended that you wait until your prednisone dosage is at 20 mg per day or lower before having permanent or coloring to your hair (dye color may not take with high dose prednisone) . Tell your hairdresser that you are taking prednisone before any hair treatments. Unwanted hair growth or loss may result from your medication regimen. Hair removal cream (depilatory) can be used for excessive facial hair. Be sure to follow directions carefully to avoid eye or lip irritation. Excess hair can also be bleached with a 5 0% peroxide solution. Waxing and electrolysis are other options. Do not alter your medications due to excess hair growth or loss . Speak with your care team if this becomes a problem for you. Dental Care: Continue with your daily routine of dental hygi ene by brushing and flossing. You should have regular dental check -ups every six months. Dental surgery should be postponed until at least 6 months after your transplant if possible . Please notify the team if you need to have dental surgery. In some cases, you will need to take a prophylacti c antibiotic, prior to surgery. You will not need prophylactic antibiotics for routine visits and cleanings. Please inform your dentist that you are taking a bisphosphonate (Reclast) for your bone health . Sexual Activ ity: Sexual activity may be resumed, as able, approximately 6 weeks following surgery. Your recovery process will impact how soon you feel ready for sexual activity. You should discuss this with your providers during your clinic visit. Your transplant may affect your sexual functioning. Certain medications can also interfere with sexual functioning. Some people avoid sexual activity because they are afraid of hurting their new lungs, or of infection. If you have any of these concerns, please discuss them with your transplant team. Since you are immunosuppressed, it is ESSENTIAL that you practice safe sex, because of an increased risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease. Please see your PCP for routine testing for STDs. You MUS T use contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancy as well. Please feel free to address questions/concerns to the transplant team. Pregnancy: The immune suppressing medications that you take after transplant are teratogenic, meaning that they can injure a fetus before the fetus is born. As highlighted in previous sections of this book, to preserve your lung function, it is imperative that you not stop these medications for any period of time, even for the purpose of pregnancy. Moreover, the impact of pr egnancy on your lung function remains unclear. Pregnancy has the potential to worsen your lung function, a decline that may not be reversible. For this reason, the BWH Lung Transplant Program discourages pregnancy for women after lung transplantation in the strongest terms. The impact of immune suppressing medications on male fertility and fetuses born of men on these medications is also unclear. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 14 We strongly encourage the use of proven contraception methods for patients who have undergone lung transplan tation. If you are a woman of childbearing age someone will speak with about risks regarding pregnancy and immunosuppressant therapy and appropriate contraception. If you have further questions about pregnancy and childbearing after lung transplantation, please discuss them with the lung transplant team in advance of listing for transplant. The pursuit of in -vitro fertilization (IVF) or other assisted methods of childbearing should also be discussed with the team at the start of your evaluation for transp lant. These techniques can impact upon your lung health and upon your ability to be active on the transplant list and should be discussed at the earliest appropriate time in the transplant process. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 15 GOING HOME Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 16 The Transition Home Now that you have had your lung transplant and are preparing to go home, it is important to recognize your new responsibilities. The transplant team will continue your lung care. This team includes the pulmonologists, the surgeon, the social worker, the nu rse coordinators, the pharmacist, the administrative coordinators, and the lung transplant nurse practitioner. At this point though, the most important member of the team is you! Without your active support, the team's best efforts cannot succeed. As the lifetime caretaker of your new lung, you will need to: Make sure you have a healthy daily schedule that includes a good diet and regular exercise. Follow your medication schedule & k now each medication dose, frequency, and its use Check and document your weig ht, temperature, spirometry, oxygen saturations , blood pressure and heart rate daily and as needed . You ar e responsible for starting this during your hospital stay and continuing at home. Keep all your scheduled clinic appointments. Make sure all your doctors, your dentists and your pharmacist know about your medications and your current condition. No sleeping on your side until 3-6 months post-transplant . No driving for 3 -6 months but depending on your health it could be even longer than 6 months , however the timeframe is usually between 3 -6 months. No lifting > 8lbs for the first 14 weeks post-transplant . The initial time at home can be quite busy. There will be many scheduled and unscheduled appointments with pulmonologists, v isiting nurses, physical therapists, and your primary care doctor. It is also important that you prepare yourself for the likelihood of readmission. Almost every patient is readmitted for medication regulation, intravenous antibiotic therapy, and various treatments for infection and rejection . It is not uncommon for patients to experience rejection during their first-year post transplant , requiring readmission to the hospital for increased immunosuppression, mainly corticosteroids such as prednisone, for treatment. It is natural to experience a range of emotions after transplantation, even in the absence of complications. You have just undergone a major life event and are learning to live with a new and unusual set of circumstances. J oy, guilt, anxiety, depression, and frustration are all common emotions after transplantation, and you may experience one or all these feelings at different times. Your transplant team is here to help you through these changes and can provide resources to help you manage them. Please let us know if you are uncomfortable in any way, and we will work to help you. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 17 Communication with the Transplant Team Having a lung transplant and taking the medications needed to prevent rejection puts you at risk for several problems. It is important for you to follow the instructions that will help prevent or lessen the problems. After discharge, you will be responsibl e for monitoring your health and calling the transplant team should problems arise. The information contained in this education book describes issues related to the lung transplant process and regaining your health and strength. The road to recovery can b e long. Each person has different concerns or is sues related to his or her own individual lifestyle. If you have any questions or concerns, please write them down and feel free to address these questions to your nurse coordinator or any member of the trans plant team before you go home or at your next follow -up visit. We encourage all patients to use Patient Gateway to communicate. This is a more efficient way to communicate questions, but it is NOT for urgent symptoms (low oxygen levels, new shortness of breath, new cough, or fevers etc .). If you have new symptoms, this requires a phone call. If you have new urgent symptoms outside of business hours, page the transplant doctor on call. Please do not wait until the end of day to contact the team as you will not get a response until the following day. Please remember: When in doubt, call! If you are thinking about calling, call! The transplant team is always available to answer your questions! Remember, your Outpatient Nurse C oordinator is your first point of contact for the team during the day and after hours contact the Pulmonologist on -call Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 18 Resources for Managing Your Transplant Health Should you develop any of the following signs or symptoms, or any others that are of concern to you, please contact the Lung Transplant Team. During weekdays, please contact your Outpatient Lung Transplant Coordinator. During the evening or on weekends ple ase contact the physician on call by calling the BWH page operator at 617 -732-6660 for a live operator. Please ask for the on -call transplant pulmonologist to be paged to your phone number. Warning Signs: Any elevation in temperature greater than 1 degree above normal A fall in spirometry in either FEV1 or FVC. A drop of more than 10% is significant and you should notify the transplant team. A drop in oximetry (oxygen saturations) of more than 2% of normal. New or increased difficulty breathin g, either at rest or exertion. Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. These can lead to poor absorption of your medications, so you must notify us promptly if they occur. Fatigue Sore throat Increase in sputum production - or change in color or odor Persistent coug h Inability to clear secretions Loss of appetite Frequency or burning with urination. A cut that does not heal. \"Just don't feel well\" For any medical life-threatening emergencies, you need to call 911 and go to the nearest emergency room. Have the physic ian there call the Lung Transplant physician at the above beeper number. For any emergency you should always call 911 and do not drive yourself to the hospital. Wound Care: Inspect your incision and tube sites every day for signs of infection - these include redness, drainage, increased pain, and/or swelling. Please notify the transplant team if any of these signs of infection occur. The visiting nurse will also be looking for any of these signs of infection. You may continue to wash your incision with soap and water during your daily shower . Pat your incision to wash and dry, do not scrub . However, we do not advi se sitting in a bath until your incision is completely healed. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 19 Temperature: You should be checking your temperature twice daily, at the s ame time each day in the morning and in the evening. Make sure not to eat or drink anything for 20 minutes before taking your temperature. If your temperature increases more than one degree from your normal you should inform the team. An increase in temper ature may indicate infection or rejection. Please be sure to record all results in your diary. Weight: Weigh yourself using a digital scale at the same time every day (usually first thing in the morning after you have urinated and before you eat or drink ). A trend of increasing weight, or an increase of 6 pounds in one week need s to be reporte d. This change usually indicates water retention. Please remember to record this information on your log sheets along with your temperature, other vital signs, spiro metry, and oximetry. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 20 Clinic Visits Professional support persons such as a visiting nurse will visit you when you go home. Appointments for follow -up in the Lung Center C/Transplant clinic along with any other appointments you may need will be made before you are discharged from the hospital. Initially , you will need to be seen every week at the Lung Transplant Clinic, which is held on either Mondays or Wednesdays, for an indefinite period until your acute issu es are addressed. A Pulmonologist or a Nurse Practitioner who is in clinic that week will see you. Just as during your pre -transplant clinic visits, the various pulmonologists involved with lung transplantation will rotate in clinic, and you will see diff erent members of the team on different days. This is also true when you schedule a bronchoscopy; the Pulmonologist who is on service on the day your test is scheduled will do your bronchoscopy. When you come to clinic after you r transplant, please arrive ONE HOUR PRIOR TO YOUR SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT . You should first go to the outpatient clinical laboratory at the 45 Francis St. entrance to have your blood drawn. A lab slip will be waiting for you there. You should then walk down the pike towards Lung cen ter C to get your Xray done (across from Lung center C ). An order will be entered in the computer for this before you arrive. You must allot enough time to do these tests to ensure you arrive on time to your clinic appointment. Every effort is made to s chedule your appointment in a way that is most convenient for you. Remember: Pleas e remember to bring your Tacrolimus (Prograf) or Cyclosporine with you to the clinic appointment. DO NOT take your morning dose of Tacrolimus /Cyclosporine before having your blood sample drawn. You need to take the medication AFTER your blood work is drawn. It is also very important that you have your blood drawn 12 hours after you have taken your previous dose of Tacrolimus /Cyclosporine from the evening before . If the time interval is greater than or less than 12 hours, it will make your level inaccurate and difficult to adjust. This may require the need to do additional bloodwork. On days when you are sche duled for follow -up visits, please make sure to bring your diary with your recorded information with you. You will be told about routine lab work (to keep track of your blood count, kidney and liver function, medication levels, etc) or special tests that y ou might need. You will undergo lab tests each time you come in for an office visit. These can include blood, urine, and sputum tests. Some of the things the tests look for are: Your white blood cell count, which can indicate whether you have an infectio n or side effects from medication. How well your kidneys and liver are working. Whether you have enough minerals in your body. How much medication (tacrolimus/cyclosporine) is in your blood . How much sugar (glucose) is in your blood. How well your blood can clot Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 21 Medic Alert Bracelet You are expected to be an active participant in your health maintenance. You will take medications such as the rest of your life. In case of an emergency or other unplanned situation that requires medical attention , it is essential to inform your health care providers that you are taking these medications. The most effective way of alerting others is by wearing a Medic Alert bracelet or necklace. It is your responsibility to obtain this bracelet. You can order through your local pharmacy or through an online vendor. Once you have r eceived your Medic Alert jewelry, you must make a commitment to wearing it and report to the company if it becomes lost or broken. When ordering your Medic Alert bracelet or necklace, please include the following information: 1. Your Name 2. 'Lung Transplant' 3. 'CMV Negative Blood Only' Wedge Pillow It is important to keep the head of the bed elevated to prevent aspirating. Aspiration c an lead to complication s such as infection and/or rejection which may require hospitalizations. In order to prevent aspirat ion, it is required that you sleep with the head of the bed elevated. This can be done by using a wedge pillow (unless you have an electric bed). Aspiratio n Precautions: It is very important to keep the head of the bed elevated 30 degrees. Do not use pillows. Purchase a wedge pillow that must be 12 -inches thick. (This is not covered by insurance ). Take an H2 -Blocker (Nexium, Pepcid, Omeprazole) or PPI (Protonix) Eat all meals in upright position (not in bed) No eating 2 hours before going to bed. Avoid foods high in acidic content. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 22 Oximetry and Spirometry A respiratory therapist will teach you how to monitor two parameters: your oxygen level (oxygen saturation) and your lung volumes (spirometry). Your oxygen saturation is measured wi th a machine called an oximeter. The oximeter is a small monitor that you place on your fingertip . It reads the percentage of blood saturated with oxygen. Using this monitor enables us to wean you from your oxygen after surgery and allows us to notice p roblems before they become serious. To obtain a micros pirom eter we will provide the name of a medical supplier and a prescription , Remetric Health phone 484 -664-7600 . You or a family member will then need to arrange for delivery. T his is not always covered by insurance and may require an out-of-pocket expense. You may also order through any online vendor or medical supply company if it records the FVC and FEV1. With your micro spirometer y ou will learn how to measure \"forced vital capacity\" (FVC) which is the amount of air you can force out of your lungs with one breath. The other important measurement is the \"forced expiratory volume in one second\" (FEV1). The micro spirometer records this number as the amount of air exhaled during the first s econd of your forced exhalation. You will measure the FVC and FEV1 daily and re cord the values in your diary . A decrease in your oximetry and/or spirometry may reflect either infection or rejection. Within a few weeks of discharge, you will receive an o ximeter and spirometer for home use. It is important for you to be consistent in taking and recording your measurements to help us detect these problems early. Helpful Hints for Performing Spirometry at Home 1. Spirometry is effort dependent. Please use th e same e ffort for each try. Performing the test while seated is best. 2. While sitting, get yourself ready by taking a few deep breaths in and out. When ready, take the biggest breath in as possible and place your mouth over the mouthpiece with your lips sealed. Then, blow out as hard and fast as you possibly can. 3. Write down the 2 numbers the machine gives you. They are called FVC and FEV1. 4. Perform this maneuver three different times and write each set of numbers down on scrap paper. 5. To pick the proper set of numbers choose the set with the highest FEV1. Write this set of numbers on your daily log sheet. 6. Please perform your spirometry every morning and record the appropriate set of numbers. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 23 7. Having these numbers logged each day will help you monitor any changes. If you notice a decline of 10% for three consecutive days, please call us. These changes might indicate a new infection or rejection. It will be to your benefit to catch these conditions as soon as possible. Exercise and Recreation The goal of your lung transplant is to a llow you to return to an active lifestyle and improved quality of life. Incorporation of a regular exercise program that emphasizes both aerobic activity and strength training is one of the surest ways to achieve these goals. In addition, performance of aerobic exercise is one of the most important predictors of the lung function that you achieve after transplant. If you choose to incorporate routine exercise into your life, you will improve how you feel, how active you are, and how well your lungs work after transplant. When you are discharged, you will continue to participate in the rehabilitation and exercise program that was developed for you. The goal of your rehabilitation is to maximize your muscular strength and endurance so that you can resume an independent life. Once you are home you must continue to work on increasing your activity level by trying to do a little more each day. Walking is an excellent way of monitoring your progress and improving your strength. Walk every day and gradually increase the length of your walk. Be sure to pace yourself and provide for adequate rest before and after your walk. It is also expected that once your dose of prednisone is 20mg or lower, you will start to participate in Pulmonary Rehab as you did prior to your transplant. All patients have received nutrition education by a transplant dietitian. Maintaining ideal body weight decreases the risk of complications such as atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. Regular exercise is a necessary weapon against obesity, osteoporosis , diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Walking is the most economical and beneficial activity. You control your diet and exercise plan, two of the most important factors in your post -transplant outcome! There are several limitations in your initial transition home to be aware of. These are due to the possible pain medications you may be taking, and to allow your incision from transplant to heal: Do not drive until your doctors gives you permission ( 3-6 months ) Do not lift anything heavier than 8 lbs. (the weig ht of a gallon of milk) including children until you are given permission (at least 14 weeks after transplant) Do not push or pull anything heavier than 8 lbs. (the weight of a gallon of milk) until you are given permission (at least 14 weeks after transpl ant) Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 24 NUTRITION Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 25 Nutrition After Lung Transplant Now that you have had a lung transplant, you may be wondering if changes will be made in your diet. It is important to your recovery process to maintain a healthy, well-balanced diet. Your dietitian will assess your individual nutritional needs and determine the number of calories and grams of protein you should be receiving every day while you are in the hospital and when you go home. Remember, you hav e unique nutritional needs based upon your age, weight status, medical condition, and food preferences. This handout will cover the general guidelines that accompany a lung transplant. Your dietitian and/or doctor will discuss any specific individual nutrition needs with you. Your dietitian will also assist you in planning your individual meal plan. Calories: Maintaining your body weight is a good way to be certain that you are getting enough calories every day. You should weigh yourself weekly. If you are underweight, please refer to the pre - transplant handout for tips to increase calories that follows this section. Avoid overeating if you tend to gain weight. If you are overweight, please refer to the section addressing your nutritional needs that follows the section on being underweight. Talk to your dietitian about weight setting goals. Protein : The medications you are taking as well as the healing process increase your body's need for protein. For these reasons, you need to pay special attention to getting adequate protein in your diet. Animal products contain the highest quality protein. The best protein choices are lean meats, fish, poultry, eggs (lim it 2-3 per week or choose egg substitutes to limit your cholesterol) and dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt (choose low fat varieties). Your dietitian will discuss with you just how much protein you need each day. For further suggestions to inc rease protein please refer to the pre -transplant handout. Salt: Since many individuals on steroids and/or immunosuppressant medications have a problem with fluid retention, a no added salt (NAS) diet is recommended. This is because salt contains the mineral sodium which can act like a sponge in the body, holding on to fluid and raising the pressure in your blood vessels. If you have Cystic Fibrosis , talk to your physicians regarding the appropriate amount of sodium for your diet. Severe limitations on sodium intake can affect the manifestations of CF in your other organs. General Guidelines for a low sodium diet: 1. Do not add salt at the table. 2. Avoid using salt when cooking. If you do cook with salt, no more than \u00bd teaspoon should be used per day. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 26 3. Avoid packaged and processed foods which contain large amounts of salt and sodium. These include: 1. Smoked, Cured, or Dried Meats and Cheeses Bacon Sardines Ham Smoke Salmon Sausage Hot Dogs Cold Cuts Canned Meats Corned Beef Chee se, processed (American or spreads) 2. Canned foods/boxed mixes with added sodium (Choose low sodium varieties when available) Canned vegetables, Soups, Pasta dishes Boxed pasta, Rice, and Potato mixes with sauces 3. Snacks and Miscellaneous items Saltines Cheese Curls Potato Chips Salted Popcorn Pretzels Salted Nuts 4. Seasonings, Sauces, and Dressings Salt Seasoned Salt Garlic Salt Onion Salt Pickles Meat Tenderizers Olives Relish Ketchup Soy Sauce Fat and Cholesterol: One of the side effects of the medications which you are now taking is that they have the tendency to raise your blood cholesterol level to higher -than-normal levels. To help control your blood cholesterol, it is important to limit the amou nt of cholesterol, trans fat and saturated fat in your diet. Fat is also a concentrated source of calories, so cutting back on your fat intake can help you control your weight (if weight control is an issue). Suggestions to Limit Saturated Fat and Choles terol: Limit red meat to 2 -3 times a week in 3-to-4-ounce portions. Red meat is beef, lamb, pork, and veal. Choose white meats such as chicken, turkey, and fish as protein sources more often than red meat. Trim visible fats from meats. Remove poultry ski n before eating. Limit egg yolks to 3 per week. Use egg whites or egg substitutes instead of whole eggs whenever possible. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 27 Choose nonfat and low-fat dairy products such as skim or 1% milk, nonfat yogurt and frozen yogurt, low fat or nonfat ice cream or ice milk, and low fat or nonfat cheeses. Avoid organ meats such as kidneys, liver, and brain. Limit your use of butter and stick margarine. Choose light tub or liquid margarine. Avoid frying foods. Prepare by baking, broiling, roasting, or steaming. For stir -frying, use a non -stick pan and Pam spray, or use Canola or Olive oil. Avoid commercially prepared cookies, cakes, crackers, chips and dips, ice cream, pastries, and salad dressings. Use canola oil rather than butter, lard, or vegetable shortening when making bread products at home. Read all labels carefully for the type and amounts of fats they contain. Calcium: Osteoporosis is a risk factor after transplant because of medications. I t is very important to have adequate calcium intake, 1200 mg per day, either by diet or supplements to help maintain strong bones. Some of the best sources of calcium are dairy products. For example, one cup of milk can give you 300 mg of calcium. This is 25% of your Daily Value. If dietary fat is a concern, there are many low-fat dairy products from which you can choose. Other non -dairy dietary sources of calcium include soy products, broccoli, turnip, collard, and mustard greens. If high calcium foo ds are difficult for you to eat regularly, please ask your doctor or dietitian which calcium supplements are right for you to take. Additional vitamin D supplements are also recommended to help you absorb adequate amounts of calcium. Additional dietary mo difications such as triglyceride, blood glucose control, low potassium and high magnesium guidelines may be necessary because of medications and will be individualized for you by the dietitian. For Cystic Fibrosis patients after transplants: All your lif e you have been encouraged to gain weight and eat whatever foods appealed to you. Now after lung transplantation caution needs to be taken with weigh t gain efforts as some of your medications may cause high triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Please see the dietitian for heart healthy ways to increase calories while decreasing saturated fat intake. You may have also consumed foods with high sodium content and at this time it is still allowed but avoid using extra salt at the table and while cooking. For additional questions and suggestions ask the dietitian at clinic or by appointment. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 28 Lung Transplant Nutrition Care Plan The information provided on the following pages is intended as a guideline to pr omote sound nutrition for a long and healthy life. More detailed information is available from your inpatient dietitian. As you are further out from your transplant your special nutrition needs may change. It is important for you to know that you can al ways have access to a dietitian at Brigham and Women's Hospital. If you live far away, the physician following you in your area can provide you with a referral to a dietitian that is closer to you. Nutrition plays a very important role after transplant a nd can have a significant impact on your quality of life as well as the success of your transplant. Maintain a healthy weight : Keeping your weight within a healthy range will ease stress on your lungs, decrease high blood sugars associated with steroids, and decrease blood pressure. Talk to your doctor or dietitian about a desirable weight for your height after transplant. A side effect of the Prednisone that you will be taking is increased appetite. It will be important to keep healthy snacks on hand, and to avoid turning to \"junk food\" to curb your cravings. Healthy Snack Ideas: Whole Grain (like Wasa, Kavli, or Ak Mak) crackers with \"natural\" peanut or almond butter. (Natural butters have oil on top and need to be mixed before eating). Carrots, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, and/or celery sticks with a vinaigrette salad dressing. Nonfat yogurt Fresh fruit or vegetables wit h low -fat cottage cheese Baked corn chips with fresh salsa or guacamole. \u00bd whole -wheat tortilla with a few slices of turkey, tomato, avocado Low salt soup with whole grain crackers English muffin pizza: \u00bd whole grain English muffin + tomato sauce + light shredded mozzarella cheese 1 cup of Whole grain cereal with skim/1% milk Bean dips or Hummus with baked pita chips Whole grain rice cakes or soy cakes. Meet your body's need for vitamins and minerals: Take a multiple vitamin with minerals for at lea st the first two months after transplant unless instructed not to do so by your transplant doctor or nurse practitioner. A well balanced diet can usually meet your body's needs for vitamins and minerals in times of good health. Try to consume foods fro m each of the food groups every day, especially vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low fat dairy products. If you eat at least five servings of fruit and vegetables per day, you may discontinue your multivitamin two months after transplant. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 29 Although, to ensure you are meeting your body's needs for all vitamins and minerals, you may also continue a daily multivitamin on a regular basis. Avoid herbal supplements and any other types of over -the-counter nutritional products not approved by the transplant team. Take in adequate calcium : Everyone young and old needs calcium in his/her diet to help keep their bones and body healthy. If you don't get enough calcium from the foods and beverages you consume, your body takes calcium from your bones to meet its needs. The Prednisone you are ta king causes your body to lose calcium, and over time this can make your bones weak and brittle. It is recommended that you take in 1,200 mg of Calcium per day. Below you will find the calcium content of food items: Dairy Foods Yogurt, nonfat plain ( 1 cup) ....... 452 mg Skim milk (1 cup) ................... 302 mg Cheddar cheese (1 oz.) ............. .204 mg Ricotta cheese, part skim (1/4 cup) ............................. .169 mg Cottage cheese (1 cup) ..............150 mg Nondairy Foods Tropicana Season's Best Orange Juice plus Calcium (1 cup) ... .................. 333 mg Whole Grain Total Cereal (1cup) ................................ 250 mg Pink salmon with bones, sardines (3 oz. cooked) ........................ 181 mg Collards, frozen (1/2 cup cooked) ......................179 mg Broccoli (1 cup, cooked) ............ 150 mg Black beans (1 cup) .................. 103 mg Almonds (1 tbsp.) ......................50 mg Soy Products Soy yogurt with calcium (3/4 cup) ............................. ..300 mg Soy milk, enriched (1 cup) ..........300 mg Tofu, firm or extra firm (1/4 cup) ...............................250 mg Soy nuts, roasted/salted (1/2 cup) ........................... ....103 mg Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 30 Practice Good Food Safety Since you are taking immune suppressing drugs, you will be more susceptible to infections and food-borne illnesses. The following recommendations should help to decrease your risk of this potential complication. Check expiration dates on all food packaging and consume the product before expiration. Wash tops of cans prior to opening. Follow package directions for storing items. Wash hands with warm soapy water before and after handling any raw foods. Thaw frozen foods in the microwave or in the refrigerator. Never thaw or marinate foods on the counter or in the sink. Sanitize cutting boards and counters with bleach (1 tablespoon per gallon water). Always clean cutting board after cutting ra w meats. Never eat raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs. Cook eggs until whites are cooked and the yolk thickens Cook meats and poultry thoroughly. Use a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat to make sure the internal temperature is at least 165 degrees. All juices and dairy products should be pasteurized. Avoid fresh squeezed juice, fresh apple cider, and homemade eggnog. Avoid sprouts, such as alfalfa, bean, and broccoli sprouts. Thoroughly rinse raw fruits and vegetables b efore eating or using in cooking. Avoid eating from street vendors, buffets and salad bars, and food samples at grocery stores. Use caution when eating out at restaurants. Use airtight containers to store leftovers. Refrigerate promptly. Do not let foo d sit at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Discard leftovers after two days in the refrigerator. Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats, or deli meats, unless they are reheated until steaming hot. Avoid getting fluid from hot dog packages on other f oods, utensils, and food preparation surfaces, and wash hands after handling hot dogs, luncheon meats, and deli meats. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 31 Do not eat soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, and Camembert, blue -veined cheeses, or Mexican - cheeses queso blanco , queso fr esco, and Panela, unless they have labels that clearly state they are made from pasteurized milk. Do not eat refrigerated p\u00e2t\u00e9s or meat spreads. Canned or shelf -stable p\u00e2t\u00e9s and meat spreads may be eaten. Do not eat refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is contained in a cooked dish, such as a casserole. Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod, tuna, or mackerel, is most often labeled as \"nova -style,\" \"lox,\" \"kippered,\" \"smoked,\" or \"jerky.\" The fish is found in the refrigerator section or sold at deli counters of grocery stores and delicatessens. Canned or shelf -stable smoked seafood may be eaten. Remember, it is always better to err on the side of caution. \"When in doubt, thr ow it out!\" Limit sodium intake Some of your transplant medications cause sodium and fluid retention. One way to prevent some of this extra fluid accumulation is by restricting your sodium intake. You may find that you need to adjust your sodium intake depending on how well your body is maintaining your fluid status. If you are taking moderate to high doses of diuretics, are experiencing ankle or leg swelling, or have any other symptoms of too much fluid in your body you may need to be more restrictive with your sodium intake. Avoid using salt at the table or in cooking. Limit your use of processed foods such as canned goods, convenience foods, fast foods, and foods with more than 300 -400 mg of sodium per serving. Try alternate flavoring aids s uch as pepper, spices, lemon and lime juices, fresh herbs, garlic, onion, and other sodium free flavorings. Limit Alcohol It is the general recommendation of the transplant team that alcohol consumption be limited to special occasions only. Talk to your doctor before drinking any alcoholic beverages. Questions? Ask your Nurse Practitioner or Physician during your clinic visit. Make an appointment with a dietitian at the Brigham and Women's Nutrition Consultation Service: (617) 732 -6054 Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 32 MED ICATIONS Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 33 Important Things to Know Ab out Your Transplant Medications After your lung transplant, you will need to take medications to prevent rejection for the rest of your life. Nonadherence (not taking your medications) is the most common reason for transplant rejection. Try never to miss even one dose of your transplant medications. If you mis s a dose of your medicine, call the Transplant Nurses or Pharmacist to ask how to proceed. It is very important to note that doses of your medications may change very often. This is especially true shortly after the transplant. You need to be dedicated to updating your list of current medications and doses and bring that list with you to all clinic visits. Because doses change so often, sometimes the instructions on the prescription bottle may be incorrect. If you are ever confused about how t o take your medications, call a member of the transplant team for clarification. Try to establish a schedule. For example, try to take the medications the same time every day. This will help maintain a consistent level of the medications in your body an d could help prevent rejection. If you miss a dose and it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose, notify a member of your transplant team, and return to your regular schedule. Never \"double -up\" on your medications. All medications pres cribed by your transplant team play an important role in keeping you healthy. However, along with their benefits, many of these medications can have several side effects and drug interactions. The side effects can be managed, but it is important that yo u notify the transplant team about any troubling side effects as soon as possible. Do not make changes to your own transplant medications as this can lead to rejection or toxicities. If you have any issues related to medication intolerance, please contact a member of the transplant team. Many of the transplant medications have several drug interactions. Please check with a member of your transplant team when starting a new prescription or over -the-counter medication, as these drugs may imp act your transplant medications. _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Important information about medications Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 34 Tacrolimus (Prograf\u00ae, FK506, FK) Tacrolimus - this medication is available as a generic and is available in 0.5mg, 1mg and 5mg capsules Prograf \u00ae What is Tacrolimus? Tacrolimus suppresses the immune system, which is necessary in lung transplant patients to prevent organ rejection. How long will I need to take Tacrolimus? Tacrolimus is a lifelong medication after lung transplant. How much Tacrolimus do I take? Doses are different for each patient, and you will get a dose that is necessary to reach a specific concentration in your blood. We generally start this medication at a low dose in the hospital after the transplant procedure and then slowly increase the dose of the medication up so that we ca n achieve an adequate level of drug in your blood. You will be required to take blood tests so that we can adjust the dose according to how much of the drug is in your blood. Doses of this medication change often, especially right after the transplant. It is important that you know how much of this medication you are always taking . How do I take Tacrolimus? Follow your transplant team's instructions carefully. This medication is generally given twice a day (the best way to take it is every 12 hours). You will be asked to take this medication with food to help prevent stomach upset. Tell me about the special blood tests that I need while I am taking Tacrolimus? To make sure that you get the appropriate dose of Tacrolimus, it is necessary for the transplant team to check how much of this drug is in your blood. We will check your Tacrolimus blood level every time you come to the outpatient transplant clinic for labs. To successfully check the Tacrolimus level in your blood you must follow several steps: 1. The night before clinic please take your dose 12 hours before you plan on being at the lab for blood work. _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Immunosuppression - Meds you need to know Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 35 2. The next morning take all morning medications, except for th e Tacrolimus, prior to coming to the clinic. 3. Once you arrive at the hospital go to give a blood sample. 4. After you have given the blood sample, take your morning dose of Tacrolimus. 5. Come to clinic ready to tell us your dose of tacrolimus, the time you took your dose the night before clinic and the time your blood sample was taken. 6. It takes 4 - 6 hours for us to get results back, so, if we need to change your Tacrolimus dose, we will call you at home to change your evening dose. Are there interactions between Tacrolimus and other drugs? An interaction generally means that one drug may increase or decrease the effect of Tacrolimus. Also, the more medications a person takes, the more likely there will be a drug interaction. Tacrolimus interac ts with many prescription and non -prescription medications, as well as some dietary supplements. Please consult with your transplant pulmonologist or transplant pharmacist before starting any new medications because of the potential for drug interaction s. Are there interactions between Tacrolimus and foods or beverages? It has been shown that grapefruit, grapefruit juice and other foods and beverages that contain grapefruit (for example, the soda Fresca has grapefruit juice in it) can increase the blood level of Tacrolimus. It is recommended that you avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juice and other foods and beverages that contain grapefruit while taking Tacrolimus. What are some of the more common side effects of Tacrolimus? Increased creatinine (a measure of kidney function) : Tacrolimus, especially at high levels, may increase your creatinine. If this occurs, it may be necessary for us to decrease your dosage. This is one of the major reasons why we will check your Tacroli mus levels so often. Increased blood sugar : some patients who are not diabetic before the transplant may develop difficulties controlling their blood sugars after the transplant. We often have to administer insulin to help control these high blood sugar s. This side effect is one that may go away with time. Increased potassium : elevations in potassium levels can be seen in patients who are receiving Tacrolimus. Potassium levels are monitored every time labs are drawn. We can manage high potassium lev els by lowering the Tacrolimus dose (if possible) or administering a medication that acts to lower the potassium levels. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 36 High blood pressure : high blood pressure is very common after transplantation. Tacrolimus can contribute to this. Several medicat ions are available for use in transplant patients with high blood pressure. High cholesterol : high cholesterol is very common after transplantation. Tacrolimus can contribute to this. Several medications are available for use in transplant patients with high cholesterol. Stomach upset and/or diarrhea: stomach upset, and diarrhea is common side effect with most medications. In order to help prevent this, we will ask you to take Tacrolimus with food. Hand tremor : Tacrolimus may cause a fine hand tremor in transplant patients and usually occurs in patients with a high blood level. This tremor may go away with time, but if it occurs, please let one of the transplant team members know and, if possible, we can lower the Tacrolimus dose. Hair loss : hair los s occurs in about 20% of patients receiving Tacrolimus. This side effect is generally seen within the 3 months post -transplant, and generally resolves on its own after approximately 6 months. NOTES: Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 37 Mycophenolate (CellCept\u00ae, Myfortic\u00ae, MMF) Mycophenolate - this medication is available a generic Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept\u00ae) is available in 250mg capsules & 500mg Mycophenolate sodium (Myfortic\u00ae) What is Mycophenolate ? Mycophenolate suppresses the immune system but works differently compared to Tacrolimus. How long will I need to take Mycophenolate ? Mycophenolate is a lifelong medication following lung transplant. How much Mycophenolate do I take? Most patients start by taking 1000 mg Cellcept\u00ae twice a day. We may decrease the dose or switch you to the sister drug Myfortic\u00ae if you experience any side effects. How do I take Mycophenolate ? Follow your transplant team's instructions carefully. This medication is generally given twice a day (the best wa y to take it is every 12 hours) . You will be asked to take this medication with food to help prevent stomach upset. Are there interactions between Mycophenolate and other drugs? Mycophenolate does n ot have as many drug interactions as Tacrolimus, however, there are still some medications that may interact with Mycophenolate . Please consult with your transplant pulmonologists or transplant pharmacist before starting any new medications because of the potential for drug interactions. Are there interactions between Mycophenolate and foods or beverages? There are no known food or beverage interactions with Mycophenolate . _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Immunosuppression - Meds you need to know Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 38 What are some of the more common side effects of Mycophenolate ? Decreased white blood cell count : it is important that we maintain your white blood cell count, as it is one way to prevent you from getting an infection. Decreased white blood cell cou nts are common in patients taking Mycophenolate . If this side effect occurs, it may require that we reduce your Mycophenolate dosage. Stomach upset and/or diarrhea: stomach upset, and diarrhea is the most common side effect with Mycophenolate . In order to help prevent this, we will have you take Mycophenolate with food. If this side effect occurs despite taking the Mycophenolate with food, we may split up the doses of this medica tion (instead of two times a day, we may have you take smaller doses three or four times a day) or lower the total daily dose. Some patients who cannot tolerate the stomach upset or diarrhea from Mycophenolate may be changed to another transplant medicati on (Myfortic\u00ae or Azathioprine) that may cause less stomach or bowel irritation. Increased risk during pregnancy: Miscarriage and birth defects have been reported in patients who become pregnant while receiving Mycophenolate. Pregnancy testing and dual con traception are recommended while taking mycophenolate and for at least 6 weeks after discontinuing its use. If you are a female of childbearing age, you will be asked to sign a form acknowledging this risk with mycophenolate. NOTES: Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 39 Prednisone Prednisone In general, prednisone is available in 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg and 20mg tablets This drug is available as a generic and is no longer available as a trade name product. Many pharmaceutical companies make a generic version of this medication; therefore, the pills are available in several different shapes and colors. What is Prednisone? Prednisone suppresses the immune system but works differently compared to both Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate . Prednisone is known as a steroid. You may be familiar with this medication, as it can also be used to treat inflammation and pain. How long will I need to take Prednisone? Prednisone is a lifelong medication after lung transplant. How much Prednisone do I take? You will be given very high intravenous doses (up to 500 mg) of this medication during and after the transplant procedure. You will be given an individualized steroid taper that you will be asked to follow upon discharge. Over the course of about 4 months your prednisone dose will taper down to 5mg daily, which you will remain on for life. How do I take Prednisone? Follow your transplant team's instructions carefully. This medication is generally given once a day in the morning . You will be asked to take this medication with food to help prevent stomach upset. Are there interactions between Prednisone and other drugs? Prednisone can interact with many prescription and non -prescription medications, as well as some dietary supplements. Please consult with your transplant nephrologists or transplant pharmacist before starting any new medications because of the potential for drug interactions. Are there interactions between Prednisone and foods or beverages? _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Immunosuppression - Meds you need to know Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 40 There are no known interactions with any foods or beverages. However, prednisone may cause retention of sodium (salt), so t ry to keep your salt intake to a minimum. What are some of the more common side effects of Prednisone? Increased blood sugar : some patients who are not diabetic before the transplant may develop difficulties controlling their blood sugars after the transplant. We often have to administer insulin , an injectable medic ation, to help control these high blood sugars. This side ef fect is one that may go away with time. High blood pressure : high blood pressure is very common after transplantation. Prednisone can contribute to this. Several medications are available for use in transplant patients with high blood pressure. High cholesterol : high cholesterol is very common after transplantation. Prednisone can contribute to this. Several medications are available for use in transplant patients with high cholesterol. Stomach upset and/or diarrhea : stomach upset, and diarrhea is common side effect with most medications. To help prevent this, we will ask you to take prednisone with food. Weight gain : prednisone can cause patients to gain weight by two mechanisms. First, it makes people hold onto water; therefore , the more water they hold onto, the heavier they get. Second, this medication can cause an increased appetite in approximately 3% of patients. Bone loss : osteoporosis is a rare, yet serious side effect of prednisone. Even as little as one dose of pred nisone can cause bone loss. If you are maintained on prednisone, it is important to have your bone mineral density checked by your primary care physician . This test should be performed every two to three years in patients who remain on prednisone after t he transplant. In order to prevent bone loss, you will be asked to take calcium, vitamin D and a once yearly IV infusion called Reclast. Night sweats : some patients may experience night sweats while receiving prednisone. This side effect usually takes p lace with higher doses and goes away with time. Mood changes : every night w e make a similar drug to prednisone in our bodies when we sleep called cortisol. Cortisol helps us deal with stress and our emotions. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 41 When prednisone is prescribed after the transplant, it is not uncommon to see patients develop rapid mood swings ( i.e., happy to sad, laughing to crying). This side effect generally disappears after about 5 days of being on the prednisone. It is important that if you have had problems with dep ression or other psychiatric illnesses in the past that you let the transplant team know if the prednisone is making it worse. Cataracts : you will be asked to make yearly visits to your eye doctor to make sure that this side effect does not take place. Acne : a small percentage of patients may develop acne after the administration of prednisone. Good skin hygiene is the best prevention for this, and over -the-counter acne medications may be helpful, but please consult with a transplant team member before starting any medications for acne. NOTES: Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 42 Other Maintenance Medications Our preferred immunosuppressive regimen is Tacrolimus, Mycophenolate and Prednisone. We will consider changing the transplant medication you are taking if you develop severe side effects from any of the transplant medications. Changing from one transplant medication to another can increase the risk for rejection. This will only be done when we feel that changing medications will provide you with a benefit moving forwa rd. Below you will find a list of other available transplant medications along with a brief description. Cyclosporine (Neoral\u00ae, Gengraf \u00ae, CsA) Cyclosporine can be used as a substitute for Tacrolimus. This medication is given twice a day, but also requir es blood work to determine the appropriate dose for you. Cyclosporine has the same drug -interaction profile as Tacrolimus. The side effects of Cyclosporine are like Tacrolimus, except that Cyclosporine tends to cause more high blood pressure and high chole sterol, but less hand tremor and blood sugar problems. Sirolimus (Rapamune\u00ae, Rapa) Sirolimus can be used as a substitute for Mycophenolate. This medication is given once a day, but also requires blood work to determine the appropriate dose for you. Siroli mus has the same drug -interaction profile as Tacrolimus . The side effects of Sirolimus are like Tacrolimus, except that Sirolimus does not cause increased creatinine, but it can cause problems with wound healing, mouth ulcers, breathing difficulties (pneum onitis) and increases in of Mycophenolate (CellCept\u00ae) and may be used a substitute for Mycophenolate. The coating may help prevent some of the stomach side effects seen with regular Mycophenolate (just like enteric coated aspirin causes less stomach side effects compared to regular aspirin). This medication is often given twice a day. This medication has the same drug -interact ions and side effects as Mycophenolate. Azathioprine (Imuran\u00ae, AZA) Azathioprine can be used as a substitute for Mycophenolate. This medication is given once a day. This medication has a significant drug interaction with some medications used to prevent g out. This medication can cause less stomach upset than Mycophenolate. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 43 Anti -Infectives Any time a person's immune system is suppressed they are at increased risk for infections. Proper hygiene, especially handwashing , is essential to prevent infections . It is also important to make sure that you have been adequately vaccinated prior to the transplant ( i.e., pneumococcal vaccine, flu -vaccine, etc.). To help prevent you from getting an infection after the transplant we will be putting you on two different types of antibiotics. You will receive one medication that is active against a type of pneumonia. Lung transplant patients are at high risk for developing a pneumonia ca lled Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pnemocystis carinii or PCP). This germ is spread in the air and is common all over the world. Since you can't help being exposed to this germ, you will receive a medication to prevent this infection. The most common medication used to prevent this pneumonia is called Bactrim, which is a sulfa -drug. Some patients have an allergy to sulfa -drugs. If you are allergic to Bactrim, you will receive another medication called Mepron or be desensitiz ed to Bactrim. You will receive a second medication that is active against viral infections. Cytomegalovirus or CMV, is a virus that is common in about 70% of Americans. People are usually infected by the time they are 2 years old or during their teenage years. Many people are infected with CMV and don't even know it because CMV usually does not cause long -term problems. CMV is spread through contact with an infected person's body fluids (such as saliva, blood, urine, semen, or breast milk). It can be sexu ally transmitted or transmitted through an organ transplant. Both you and your do nor will be tested to see if you have ever been exposed to this virus. If either you or your donor have been exposed to the CMV virus, then you will receive the medication Val cyte. If neither you nor the donor have ever been exposed, you will receive Valtrex. _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Anti-infectives Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 44 Antibiotic - Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (Bactrim\u00ae, SMZ/TMP) As mentioned above, the most common antibiotic used to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia is called Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (Bactrim) , which known as SMZ / TMP) - this drug is av ailable as a generic medication and is available as a \"single strength (SS)\" 400mg/80mg tablet and a \"double strength tablet. Bactrim \u00ae How do I take Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim ? The dose is different for every patient. It is de pendent on blood tests at the time of transplant . How long will I need to take Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim ? Bactrim is a lifelong medication after lung transplant. What are some of the more common side effects from Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim ? Increased creatinine : Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim may increase your creatinine. If this occurs, it may be necessary for us to discontinue this medication early or start you on a different antibiotic. Stomach upset and/or diarrhea : stomach upset, and diarrhea is common side effect with most medications. In order to help prevent this, we will ask you to take this drug with food. Increased potassium : elevations in potassium levels can be seen in patients who are receiving Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim. Potassium levels are monitored every time labs are drawn. Persistent elevations in potassium may require us to discontinue this medication and start you on a differ ent antibiotic. Decreased white blood cell count : it is important that we maintain your white blood cell count, as it is one way to prevent you from getting an infection. Sensitivity to the sun : this medication can make your skin more sensitive to the sun and more likely to develop sunburn, even in the winter. Please wear sunscreen when you go out into the sun to help prevent sunburns. Rash : rarely, patients receiving Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim can develop a rash. If this happens to you, please call your one of the transplant team member. You may need to be switched to another antibiotic. _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Anti-infectives Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 45 Antibiotic - Atovaquone (Mepron \u00ae) For those patients that are allergic to sulfa -drugs, we will use Atovaquone to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia, which is just as effective, but does not cause the allergic reactions that are seen in some patients who take sulfa -drugs. Atovaquone - this drug is currently available as a generic medication and only comes as a liquid suspension of 750mg/5mL. Mepron \u00ae How do I take Atovaquone ? You will take 1500 mg (10 mL or 2 teaspoons) once daily. How long will I need to take Atovaquone ? Atovaquone is a lifelong medication after lung transplant. What are some of the more common side effects from Atovaquone ? Stomach upset and/or diarrhea: stomach upset, and diarrhea is common side effect with most medications. To help prevent this, we will ask you to take Atovaquone with food. NOTES: _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Anti-infectives Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 46 Antiviral - Valganciclovir (Valcyte \u00ae) If either you or your donor has been exposed to CMV, then you will receive a medication called Valganciclovir, which is very effective at preventing CMV from causing an infection. Valganciclovir - this medication is currently av ailable as a generic and comes as a 450mg tablet. Valcyte \u00ae How do I take Valganciclovir? The dose of your valganciclovir will be dependent upon your kidney function and may change over time as your kidney function changes. How long will I need to take Valganciclovir ? You will be taking this medication for 6 -12months following the transplant depending upon your risk of developing the CMV infection . This medication may be restarted after the transplant if we believe you are at increased risk to develop CMV disease , such as after receiving treatment for acute rejection What are some of the more common side effects from Valganciclovir? Stomach upset and/or diarrhea: stomach upset, and diarrhea is common side effect with most medications. To help prevent this, we will ask you to take this drug with food. Decreased white blood ce ll count : it is important that we maintain your white blood cell count, as it is one way to prevent you from getting an infection. NOTES: _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Anti-infectives Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 47 Antiviral - Valacyclovir (Valtrex \u00ae) If both you and the donor have never been exposed to CMV, then you will receive a medication called Valacyclovir, which is used to prevent an infection from the Herpes Simplex Virus. Valacyclovir - this drug is available as a generic medication and comes as a 500mg tablet. Valtrex \u00ae How do I take Valacyclovir? The dose of your valganciclovir will be dependent upon your kidney function and may change over time as your kidney function changes. How long will I need to take Valacyclovir ?

NOTES: _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Anti-infectives Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 48 Vaccinations It is important to make sure that you have been adequately vaccinated prior to the transplant (i.e., pneuomococcal vaccine, flu -vaccine, etc.). We may not administer any vaccinations within 3 months of the transplant or until your prednisone dose is lowered because you will not respond to the vaccine given the high amount of immunosuppression you will be receiving. However, after the transplant, some vaccines should not b e administered to patients on drugs that suppress the immune system. The vaccines that we ask you to avoid are those that come from live viruses. See below for a list of vaccines that are appropriate for patients before and after the transplant procedure . Please discuss the use of vaccines with a member of the transplant team before receiving any vaccinations. You should get the flu vaccine your PCP every year and the pneumococcal vaccine every five years by your PCP. If you are unable to get these vacci nes from your PCP, please contact the transplant team. Vaccine Recommended for transplant candidates Recommended for transplant recipients *Influenza (Flu) Yes Yes Hepatitis B Yes Yes Hepatitis A Yes Yes Tetanus Yes Yes Polio, inactivated Yes Yes S. pneumonia Yes Yes N. meningitides Yes Yes Rabies Yes Yes Varicella Yes No BCG Yes No Papillomavirus (HPV) Some Yes (for some patients) Smallpox No No Anthrax No No Zoster Some No * Please note that transplant patients should not be given the nasal flu vaccine (FluMist \u00ae) because it is a live virus. Also, it is recommended that family members also NOT receive the nasal flu vaccine. If any member of your family (or anyone living in yo ur household) receives a live-virus vaccine, you should do your best to avoid contact with that individual for at least one week (yes, we understand this will be difficult). _____________________ __________ Lung Transplant Medications Vaccinations Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 49 High Blood Pressure and High Cholesterol Medications Heart disease is a very serious problem in kidney transplant patients. High bl ood pressure occurs in nearly 85 % of patients after the transplant. High cholesterol occurs in nearly 60 % of patients after the transplant. Your blood pressures and cholesterol levels will be monitored very closely after the transplant. It is very important for transplant patients to try to stick to a heart -friendly diet and to try to exercise (walking, biking, swimming, etc.). Proper management of your blood sugars (in patients who have diabetes) and stop ping smoking (in patients who smoke) can all help improve your health. _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Other commonly used medications High Cholesterol The important transplant medication Tacrolimus is known to increase cholesterol, and so is prednisone. The goal \"bad cholesterol\" (LDL cholesterol) is less than 100. Diet is the first step to try to reduce your cholesterol. Many patients will require medication to lower their cholesterol level. Your transplant team will choose the cholesterol lowering medication that is right for you. When you are on a cholesterol medication, a muscle enzyme test known as \"CK\" and your liver enzymes will be checked every 3 months, because cholesterol -lowering medications may rarely affect the levels of these lab tests. High Blood Pressure The goal blood pressure after the transplant will be less than 130/80. However, if you are a diabetic, the recommended goal blood pressure is at or less than 125/75. Many patients require more than one medication t o control their blood pressure. Your transplant team will choose the blood pressure medication(s) that is/are right for you. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 50 Blood Sugar Medications High blood sugars are very common after transplantation with new onset diabetes occurring in up to 25 -30% of lung transplant recipients , mostly due to medications . Diabetes after transplant is associated with increased risk of heart disease and infection which are serious complications following transplant. Your blood sugars will be monitored very closely after transplant Most patient s will be taught how to use and be discharged home with a glucometer, a device that measures blood sugars. If your blood sugars are consistently high after transplant you will be started on insulin, an injectable medication to help lower your blood sugars. Some patients can stop insulin if their sugars improve as the prednisone dose decreases, however some patients may require long term management of blood sugars wit h insulin or an oral agent. Blood Thinning Medications Blood clots are very common following lung transplant, occurring in up to 30% of patients. Blood clots can lead to serious complications including pulmonary embolism which could affect the function of your new lung. Ambulation is essential to prevent blood clots . However, after lung transplant most patients are not able to walk enough to prevent blood clots on their own. You will receive an injection called enoxaparin or heparin to help t hin the blood to prevent blood clots. You will be discharged on this injectable medication for approximately one-month post - transplant , until we are confident that you are walking enough to prevent blood clots without medication. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 51 Over the Counter (OTC) Medications & Dietary Supplements Over -the-counter medications and dietary supplements are consumed by millions of American for common illnesses such as aches and pains, stomach upset, diarrhea, the common cold, and others. Many over -the-counter m edications are safe for transplant recipients to take, but several are not. If, at any time after the transplant, you want to use an over -the-counter medication, please call your transplant team to make sure that it is OK to take these medications. Some over -the-counter medications are not good to use in lung transplant patients because they can harm the kidney, raise the blood pressure, or have interactions with some of the transplant medications. Some common over -the-counter medicati ons that should never be taken by lung transplant patients include: Aches and Pains: Ibuprofen Choline salicy late - Arthropan) Magnesium salicylate (also called - Doan's, Keygesic, Momentum) Sodium salicylate Cough and Cold: Pseudoephedrine Sudafed) Phenylephrine (also called and Pectin (also called - Kaodene, KaoSpen, Kapectolin) It is important for you to know that many over -the-counter medications contain several different drug combinations. For example, Tylenol Allergy Sinus contains acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine and pseudoephedrine. Because this product contains pseudoephedrine, transplant patients should not use it. Please read over -the-counter medications boxes very carefully, looking specifically for the active ingredients. Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 52 Call one of your transplant team members if you are confused about what over -the-counter products you can or cannot take. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not approve dietary supplements for use in the United States; therefore, we cannot safely advise our patients to take them. Several dietary supplements have been shown to have severe interactions with transplant medications. For example, St John's Wort has been shown to decrease the blood levels of Tacrolimus, which may cause rejection. Other dietary supplements are known to cause harm to the kidneys, such as chromium and creatine. Please avoid the use of any dietary supplements unless it is specifically discussed with one of the transplant team members. NOTES: Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 53 Over -the-Counter Cough and Cold Medications Fact Sheet Steps for selecting an OTC cough/ cold product: 1. Read the product label. Identify the drug chemical name. This is usually on the back and will give an amount next to it. 2. Check to see if the medication name is on the approved medications list (right). If yo u are unsure, check with your pharmacist or the transplant team. 3. Do not use products that contain ingredients on the \"Not Approved\" List LOOK AT THE DRUG INGREDIENTS Approved Medications: Pain Reliever: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) - This drug relieves aches, pains and fever. It should not be taken with alcohol - Maximum daily dose is 3000mg - more than this can cause damage to will make you drowsy. Avoid alcohol and driving while taking these medications. - These medications may also cause urine retention. Consult a member of the transplant team if this occurs. Cough ( please call your nurse coordinator as this may represent an infection ): Guaifenesin (Mucinex) - This medication is used to loosen congestion in the chest to help aid in coughing the mucus up. Dextromethorphan - This medication is used to suppr ess or stop a cough. - Check with your pharmacist if you are taking anti -depressants or mood stabilizers. - Do not take more than 120 mg in one day. Runny Nose: Drink plenty of fluids, especially water Use a humidifier Saline Nasal Spray (Ocean) Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 54 Approved Medications: Saline - You may only use nasal decongestion sprays. - Do not use the spray for longer than 3 days or the congestion may get worse. - You must monitor your blood pressur e if you use oxymetazoline. Sore Throat: Drink plenty of fluids especially water. Gargle with salt in warm water. Phenol Spray (Chloraseptic) Throat Lozenges - Cough drops are ok, as long as they do not contain any herbal supplements. - Cepacol, Chloraseptic, Sucrets are ok. Combination Products: Generally, combination products should be avoided. Please check with your pharmacist or transplant team for specific product questions. Here is a list of combination products that are OK to take: NyQuil cold and flu (acetaminophen diphenhydramine) Tylenol chest congestion (acetaminophen + guaifenesin) Not Approved - Do Not Take Medications: - Any generic or store brand product that contains un -approved ingredients. - Any medication not listed on the approved list without your transplant doctor's approval. - Any herbal supplements. Some examples of products to avoid : - Airborne - Alka -Seltzer Plus Cold - Aspirin (ok to take for heart protection) - Claritin D or Loratadine D (plus pseudoephedrine) - Cold -eeze products - DayQuil multi -symptom cold and cough - cough CF - Robitussin chest congestion PE - Robitussin cough cold and flu - Robitussin cough and allergy - Tylenol Allergy multi -symptom - Tylenol sinus congestions and pain (regular, day or nighttim e formulations) - Tylenol allergy complete - Tylenol sinus - Tylenol Cold Multi -symptom - Tylenol Cold Congestion - Theraflu Products - Vicks 44D cough and head congestion relief - Zicam Products - Zinc preparations Lung Tra nsplant Diary |. Lung Transplant Program Page 55 Drug Interactions The transplant medications have a lot of drug interactions with other prescription and over - the-counter medications, as well as dietary supplements. When one medication interacts with a transplant medication, it may result in increased or decreased exposure to the transplant medication, or it may expose the patient to medi cations with similar side effects. Some practical examples of drug interactions may include: o Tacrolimus and Verapamil (blood pressure medication) = increases in tacrolimus blood levels potentially resulting in tacrolimus toxicity. o Tacrolimus and Carbamazepine (medication used to prevent seizures) = decreases in tacrolimus blood levels potentially resulting in rejection of the transplant. o Tacrolimus and Ibuprofen (over -the-counter pain medication) = both medications can cause kidney dysfunction and when used together are more likely to cause this side effect. Below is a small list of medications that would interact with your transplant medications and could potentially cause toxicities or rejection of the transplant. Because medications can go by different names before you start ANY new medication you should check with your Transplant Pharmacist or Transplant Pulmonologist. Antibiotics Antifungals Blood Pressure Pain Relievers Others - Amikacin Clarithromycin Erythromycin B Fluconazole - Itraconazole - Ketoconazole - Lipid -based Amphotericin B Posaconazole Voriconazole Diltiazem Naproxen Piroxicam Sulindac Amiodarone - - Protease Inhibitors - Sevelamer _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Your Medication Schedule _______________________________ Lung Transplant Medications Drug Interactions Lung Tra nsplant Diary |.
