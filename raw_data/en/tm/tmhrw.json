Since it began, Covid-19 has brought forth anti-vaxxers, Covid-deniers, and questionable remedies in ways that parallel responses to earlier disease crises. \"Intravenous drips, ozone therapy and immunity-boosting music\" are among the more benign unproven Covid cures advertised recently. [1](#f1) Alternative remedies\u2014both dubious and more respectable\u2014proliferate in situations where orthodox medicine provides few satisfying answers. [2](#f2) Of course, this was true long before Covid-19. Allopathic medicine has historically proven ineffective against chronic pain, degenerative illnesses, migraines, insomnia, and psychological complaints, leading unsatisfied patients to seek care from chiropractors, osteopaths, mesmerists, and Christian Science healers. [3](#f3) Such unorthodox therapies have disproportionately appealed to women, who have a harder time getting doctors to take their pain seriously and who were, until the 1990s, seldom included in clinical trials of new medications and treatments. [4](#f4) Today, \"Americans now consult their homeopaths, naturopaths, herbalists, acupuncturists, chiropractors, and Reiki workers more often than they see their primary care physicians,\" as Steve Silberman wrote in 2015. [5](#f5) A similar situation prevails in Britain, where \"dozens of . . . creative, sensory, mind-body and manual therapies\" vie for prominence with traditional medicine. [6](#f6) How did we get here? As modern biomedicine develops ever more sophisticated treatments and cures, one would expect heterodox remedies to become less popular, not more so. In fact, though, both the idea of scientific medicine and the distinction between orthodox [End Page 34] and alternative medicine are relatively new. To have a \"properly\" regarded alternative medicine, one must first have a sufficiently stable \"orthodoxy\" to oppose. As medical historian Roberta Bivins explains, \"such an orthodoxy only emerged in the western medical marketplace in the nineteenth century,\" the period covered by this theme issue. [7](#f7) Until the late eighteenth century, there were no medical licensing bodies and practitioners competed for patients in an unregulated market, largely following the humoral theories of Galen and Hippocrates. [8](#f8) This issue looks at America and Britain in the nineteenth century, when allopathic medicine emerged on a scientific footing and alternative therapies proliferated in response. This period witnessed watershed medical discoveries such as advances in surgical techniques, the emergence of the germ theory of disease, and the application of experimental research methods. Late-Victorian researchers conducted clinical studies on human patients and controversial experiments on live animals. The founding of university- and state-sponsored laboratories and the development of medical specialties with their own journals and jargons also proceeded apace. To cite only one example of such disciplinary specialization, consider the study of the brain and nervous system over the course of the nineteenth century. At the beginning of this period, research on this topic was conducted by gentlemen amateurs, philosophers, and generalist physicians such as Herbert Spencer, George Henry Lewes, and William Benjamin Carpenter. Non-specialists, including literary authors like George Eliot and Wilkie Collins, also wrote with authority about the mind and brain in their fiction and in generalist periodicals like The Cornhill Magazine (1860-1975) and The Nineteenth Century (1877-1972). By the 1870s, however, neuroscience gravitated toward clinical and animal experiments conducted by specialists like David Ferrier, John Hughlings Jackson, and Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal. For instance, Ferrier's cerebral localization experiments on live monkeys led to accurate human cortical maps that enabled surgeons to locate tumors or hemorrhages before opening the skull, an innovation that saved many human lives. The latter half of the century also witnessed the founding of the specialist journals Mind (1876-present) and Brain (1878-present) and the establishment of the first European professorship in neurology in 1882 (for Jean-Martin Charcot in France), an event that historians of science sometimes identify as the beginning of neurology as an independent field. [9](#f9) Parallel advances occurred across all medical fields in the nineteenth century. Despite this scientific progress, however, great numbers [End Page 35] of people in Britain and America preferred heterodox health care practices marginalized by the increasingly powerful and state-aligned mainstream medicine of the period. The motives for adopting heterodox methods varied as widely as the practices themselves: folk and domestic medicine maintained traditional, local practices; faith-healing such as mesmerism, Spiritualism, Christian Science, and New Thought reacted against medical materialism; and eclectic practices such as homeopathy, phrenology, and hydropathy sought to combine the new science-based medicine with a purist return to nature. What these diverse methods shared was a generally adversarial relationship to mainstream medicine. As medical historian James Whorton explains, unorthodox medical regimens and their practitioners asserted individual patient choice in opposition to hegemonic systems of authority. [10](#f10) In other words, alternative practitioners opposed what Michel Foucault has called biopower: the state-sanctioned tendency to \"measure, appraise, and hierarchize\" human populations according to scientific \"norms.\" [11](#f11) In Britain, this tendency led to compulsory public health legislation such as the Vaccination Acts, which required smallpox vaccination of newborns, and the Contagious Diseases Acts, which ordered the compulsory screening of prostitutes for sexually transmitted disease. Both were strongly opposed by the public and seen as a violation of individual rights. [12](#f12) By contrast, unorthodox healers valorized patient choice. Their holistic methods treated the patient as a unique person, not a set of statistics. They spent more time listening to their patients and advertised their remedies as gentle and natural. Heterodox practitioners claimed to stimulate the body's natural healing powers, known as the vis medicatrix naturae, thereby avoiding aggressive medical intervention. [13](#f13) Such claims should be met with skepticism, however. Some alternative treatment systems, such as Thomsonianism with its reliance on harsh emetics, were scarcely less punishing than their allopathic counterparts. [14](#f14) Nevertheless, the heterodox emphases on individual choice and on gentle, natural healing understandably attracted many customers. Until midcentury, allopaths promoted so-called \"heroic\" remedies such as bleeding, emetics, laxatives, blistering, and the application of leeches to the skin. Predictably, these therapies did more harm than good. One of the most frequently prescribed drugs of the time, calomel, contained a toxic mercury compound that caused patients' cheeks and gums to bleed, their teeth to fall out, and sometimes destroyed their jawbones. [15](#f15) When George Washington fell ill with a sore throat and labored breathing in 1799, he was given calomel, bled repeatedly, and [End Page 36] had his throat blistered. Left alone, Washington might have survived; as it was, his illness and treatment killed him within days. [16](#f16) Even by the mid-nineteenth century, after such heroic treatments fell out of vogue, new scientific discoveries did not yet translate into improved patient care. For instance, the ongoing revolution in neuroscience had little immediate benefit for patients with neurasthenia, a diagnosis introduced in 1869 that encompassed depression, anxiety, and other psychological ills. [17](#f17) The so-called \"rest cure\" was perhaps the most benign mainstream option offered to neurasthenic women, the other choices being institutionalization or gynecological surgery. Invented by Philadelphia neurologist and novelist Silas Weir Mitchell in the 1870s, the rest cure involved weeks or months of forced bed rest combined with vast amounts of milk and meat. Patients were typically forbidden to read, sew, or even sit up in bed without permission. [18](#f18) While some women claimed to enjoy Mitchell's regimented care, his stultifying treatment drove others mad, as suggested by Charlotte Perkins Gilman's semi-autobiographical short story \"The Yellow Wall-Paper\" (1892). [19](#f19) With such unappealing options, it is no wonder that many female nervous invalids (and a fair number of men) turned to homeopathy, mesmerism, Christian Science, and other alternative treatments. Take, for instance, neurasthenic author Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, best known for her post-Civil War Spiritualist bestseller, The Gates Ajar (1868). A self-described \"professional invalid,\" suffering from chronic insomnia, Phelps maintained a friendly correspondence with Mitchell in which they discussed their mutual interest in fiction writing. [20](#f20) Yet Phelps politely refused Mitchell's offer to treat her with his rest cure, opting instead for homeopathy, which meant dosing patients with medicines that created similar effects to the illness itself, but in small amounts that the body could manage. Homeopathy was highly popular in the U.S. during the nineteenth century, especially among progressives and Spiritualists, due to its \"gentler and less invasive approach to curing illness [and] its emphasis upon the body's natural ability to cure itself if stimulated correctly.\" [21](#f21) Similarly, British-born American author Frances Hodgson Burnett, who penned children's classics like The Secret Garden (1911) and A Little Princess (1905), suffered throughout her life from debilitating bouts of depression and insomnia. While she tried variants of Mitchell's rest cure, she also availed herself of the healing benefits of Christian Science, a religious movement founded in 1879 by former homeopath Mary Baker Eddy. Christian Science teaches that the material world, [End Page 37] suffering, evil, and death are illusions caused by wrong thinking. Patients are encouraged to think of themselves as already well and to behave as if they were cured. A related movement called New Thought taught that positive thinking had the power to change the universe. Though neither alternative nor allopathic remedies substantially helped Burnett's symptoms, she found solace in Christian Science and New Thought, and promoted them in The Secret Garden and other fictions. [22](#f22) Neither Phelps nor Burnett overcame their chronic medical conditions. Why, then, were these women and many others like them so devoted to alternative treatments? Medical historian Anne Harrington suggests that alternative remedies help patients make spiritual meaning out of their illnesses. [23](#f23) Traditionally, humans have turned to folklore and religion to understand existential questions that accompany illness, such as \"Why me? Why now? What next?\" [24](#f24) Modern biomedicine, by contrast, provides only mechanistic explanations. Medical sociologist Arthur Frank argues that orthodox medicine favors the \"restitution narrative,\" a story in which doctors repair the damaged body much as they would a broken car. Once \"fixed,\" the patient is said to be \"as good as new.\" [25](#f25) Such restitution occurs, for instance, when an infection is cured by an antibiotic or a tumor is safely removed. But patients whose ailments cannot be cured by a pill or procedure may find their testimony disregarded by doctors and laymen alike. Such patients are forced to make meaning out of illness on their own, usually through what Frank calls a \"quest narrative\" (a story of illness as a journey of learning or personal growth). [26](#f26) Alternative systems of healing help patients make sense of their illness when no simple restitution narrative is possible. In fact, Harrington explains, most systems of alternative healing come with built-in stories that help patients process their experiences. The nineteenth-century Christian Scientist or New Thought believer learned that her thoughts had the power to change the universe, including how she experienced her own body. She aimed to triumph over physical ills through right thinking, prayer, and meditation. The Victorian homeopath trusted the body's natural systems of healing to gradually build internal resistance to disease. Such methods often succeeded by harnessing the \"placebo effect,\" that is, by acting upon a patient's symptoms through his mind. [27](#f27) Moreover, heterodox remedies helped patients grapple with \"the 'why' questions of suffering\" and \"connect their experiences to some larger understanding of their identities and destinies.\" [28](#f28) Modern biomedicine, with its laser focus on diseases and cures, rarely addresses such existential matters. [End Page 38] The essays in this theme issue address this nexus of concerns, exploring how and why nineteenth-century Britons and Americans turned to specific alternative remedies. Authors discussed here include novelists Edward Bulwer-Lytton and E. M. Forster; licensed physicians Lydia Fowler and J. J. Garth Wilkinson; poet Sydney Dobell; and caricaturist J. Leech. Their works show how heterodox health practices were represented and disseminated through written texts, whether imaginative, testimonial, or instructive. Haejoo Kim's essay explores the lesser-known heterodox medical practice of hydropathy, by which patients subject themselves to tight wrapping in wet sheets and pure water ablutions in order to purify their bodies and restore health. Kim takes as her focus two testimonies of cold water cure patients and what they can tell us about how \"lay individuals\" navigated the \"period's complex, full-fledged alternative medical market.\" While novelist and politician Edward Bulwer-Lytton advocated the water cure, explaining how it freed him from dependence on allopathic medicines, J. Leech reacted to his own hydropathic treatment with bemused skepticism. Writing in character as \"the Moist Man\" for the humor journal Punch (1841-1992), Leech portrays \"the public fervor for hydropathy\" as \"a perverted taste for captivity\" in which wealthy patients willingly subject themselves to discomfort. Kim reads these hydropathic testimonies in the larger context of heterodox medical practices, and also theorizes the meaning of heterodoxy itself for Victorians, thus laying much of the ground for the other essays in this issue. Ellen O'Brien examines Victorian heterodox medicine in relation to the rhetoric of melodrama that runs through the discourse to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts in Britain. Focusing on the writings of J. J. Garth Wilkinson, a homeopath who was also a credentialed member of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Apothecaries Society, O'Brien demonstrates that repealers relied upon generic conventions of melodrama to oppose medical orthodoxy and state control of bodies with a more \"dispersed network of . . . unregulated holistic and alternative medical practices.\" In repeal discourse, O'Brien argues, the state or the doctor is framed as melodramatic male villain intent on violating women. By contrast, heterodox practices such as prayer and domestic medicine offer \"moral rightness\" and \"purity\" as part of their efficacy while upholding individual civil rights. In her reading of Lydia Fowler's temperance novel, Nora: The Lost and how heterodox [End Page 39] medicine and temperance supported and were shaped by the early women's movement. Best known as one of the \"Phrenological Fowlers,\" the American family who built a publishing empire upon phrenology as practical \"self-culture,\" Lydia Fowler was also an accredited medical doctor. Fowler's phrenological writings on temperance, including Nora, provided an early harbinger of the disease model of alcoholism that gained ascendancy in the twentieth century. But as it claimed that individuals could alter their \"organization\" by proper behavior, diet, and exercise, the Fowlers' phrenology promised a more optimistic and attractive model for health than much of mainstream Victorian medicine. Jack Rooney considers the practice of Victorian automatic writing, particularly by female practitioners such as Camila Crosland and Sophia Elizabeth De Morgan, not just as attempts at communication but as alternative forms of wellness and self-care. At midcentury, mostly female mediums would use automatic writing to receive comfort from a spirit other, but by the 1870s medicinal automatic writing had become a commercialized exchange between a transcribing healer and a spirit who offered medical prescriptions and instructions. Rooney posits that this practice is prefigured by the Spasmodic poets of mid-century who also \"recorded spontaneous messages little mediated by rational control,\" and who, in the case of Sydney Dobell, considered the \"exhaustion of reason as a means of wellness.\" At the same time, the Spasmodics as well as later automatic writers acknowledged the limits and dangers of the occult. Elsa Richardson's chapter on vegetarian restaurants in late-Victorian and Edwardian London demonstrates how these spaces enabled negotiations of gender, work, and health in the lives of city-dwellers and in the fiction that represents those lives. Richardson argues that vegetarianism served as an \"alimentary expression of radical affiliations\" including socialism and suffragism, but that it also was embraced by the new sedentary city worker for its purported digestive health benefits to combat the modern ill of dyspepsia (indigestion). When Margaret Schlegel invites stodgy Henry Wilcox to lunch at the famous Eustace Miles restaurant, Forster is signaling the political and constitutional differences between his two Howards End characters with a reference that his readers would have recognized. As Richardson also shows, the health benefits of vegetarianism were commodified by the Eustace Miles and other health food sellers around the idea that \"a simpler life, removed from the dulling effects of industrial capitalism, could be purchased.\" [End Page 40] These essays provide a window onto the past and shed light on current medical controversies. The anti-vaccination movement, for instance, has a long intellectual genealogy explored in Kim's and O'Brien's essays and elsewhere. Moreover, modern patients who turn to essential oils, acupuncture, and other alternative remedies have much in common with their nineteenth-century forebears. They, too, are mostly women animated by anti-establishment motives and the desire for greater personal agency in medical care. Lastly, alternative remedies and their advocates can help us identify problems with mainstream medicine and how they might be improved. These essays suggest that patients resent the top-down hierarchy of orthodox medicine and crave more personal contact with their physicians. They want their doctors to see them as individuals with physical and spiritual needs, not as machines in need of fixing. Finally, patients want their physicians to consider quality of life instead of automatically resorting to aggressive measures like surgery or chemotherapy. Examining nineteenth-century health movements exposes the roots of these modern problems and may guide us to future solutions.

NOTES [2.](#f2-text) Following the lead of medical historian James Whorton, we use the term \"orthodox medicine\" interchangeably with allopathic medicine, conventional medicine, and mainstream medicine to designate medicine practiced by MDs ( [Whorton, Nature Cures, 18](#b19)). Similarly, alternative practitioners will be referred to as unorthodox or heterodox. [5.](#f5-text) [Silberman, Neurotribes, 70](#b15). This has been true at least since the 1990s, when major surveys revealed that \"both in 1990 and 1997, consumers made more visits to 'alternative' practitioners than to all US primary care physicians\" ( [Bivins, Alternative Medicine, 183](#b1)).

[19.](#f19-text) Gilman experienced Mitchell's rest cure at his clinic in Philadelphia in 1887. She denounced the cure in her posthumously published autobiography, The Living of Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1935), and in her fiction. Yet biographers suggest that Gilman's return to her then-husband, Walter Stetson, was far more damaging to her mental health than the rest cure itself, which she found comparatively pleasant (see, for instance, [Davis, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, 95-105](#b4)).
