Before any individual can begin the road to recovery or enter a rehabilitation facility, they must rid their bodies of the toxic and harmful substances they have been using. Doing this in a medically supervised facility like Square One Health, allows each client to go through the detox process with the least amount of withdrawal symptoms and risk. Everyone's experience is different, which is why the process needs to be tailored to fit every person's unique experience. While detoxing off of these toxic substances always holds risk, it is drastically reduced by the use of medications and 24/7 supervision from an experienced medical team. The help and expertise of trained medical professionals is one of the most proven ways to decrease the symptoms related to detoxing. The Square One Health Way Here at Square One Health, we use a wide variety of methods to make detox a safe and effective process.
