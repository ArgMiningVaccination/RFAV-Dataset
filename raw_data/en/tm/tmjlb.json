But there is not much research to tell us how well they work compared to traditional (mainstream) medicine. - Often complementary therapies are part of an overall health program, which is important. Talk about them with your doctor. - Do not stop taking your daily asthma preventer medication without talking to your doctor first. - If you think you have an allergy, keep a symptom diary. Record the time and what you are doing when your asthma is worse. This helps you find your triggers and helps to make it clear if the complementary therapies are helping. On this page What are complementary therapies? [Complementary therapies](/health/conditionsandtreatments/complementary-therapies) are any healthcare practices or products that are not part of 'standard' medical care. A complementary therapy is a: - treatment - medicine - different idea or theory about why and how disease happens and how to treat it. Scientists have studied some therapies, so we know how well they work. Others need more research to tell us if they can help with [asthma](/conditionsandtreatments/asthma). Some complementary therapies used by people with asthma include: [acupuncture](/health/conditionsandtreatments/acupuncture) - therapy [traditional Chinese medicine](/health/conditionsandtreatments/chinese-herbal-medicine) [yoga](/yoga-health-benefits). Don't change or stop your [asthma medicines](/health/conditionsandtreatments/asthma-medications) without talking with your doctor first. Caution regarding complementary therapies for asthma Any treatment has the potential to help as well as harm. Some complementary therapies that can cause asthma symptoms are: - echinacea - bee pollen - royal jelly - propolis - garlic - products containing aspirin. If you would like to try any complementary therapies, talk to your doctor first. Talk to your doctor about: - how you'd like to improve your asthma - how you can measure whether the therapy is having any effect on your asthma control and symptoms. Talking about your choices with your doctor will help you to effectively [manage your asthma](/health/conditionsandtreatments/asthma-management). Many therapies are designed to complement your existing medical treatment not replace it. Keep using your asthma medicines to avoid asthma flare-ups while you try complementary therapies. Asthma and acupuncture - is an ancient Chinese treatment - involves placing thin acupuncture needles into the surface of the skin to influence the flow of energy ('qi' or 'chi') - is safe when used by well trained practitioners using sterile needles. Acupuncturists believe this aids the body's own self-healing systems, which helps maintain good health. There has been research to investigate the role of acupuncture in the treatment of many conditions. The evidence at this time suggests that acupuncture is not helpful in the treatment of asthma. Asthma and diet It's a common belief that avoiding [dairy products](/health/healthyliving/Dairy-and-dairy-alternatives) can improve asthma. There is very little evidence to support this. People with asthma should only stop eating dairy if they have a [food allergy to cow's milk](/health/conditionsandtreatments/cows-milk-allergy). It is important for people with asthma to eat a [healthy diet](/health/healthyliving/healthy-eating). Some studies show: - eating 5 servings of [vegetables](/health/healthyliving/fruit-and-vegetables)and 2 servings of [fruit](/health/healthyliving/fruit-and-vegetables)per day may help to reduce asthma flare ups - children who eat a diet high in fruit, vegetables and [fish](/health/healthyliving/fish)have a lower chance of getting asthma - a diet high in fruit and vegetables may improve lung function. Asthma and herbal medicine [Herbal medicine](/health/conditionsandtreatments/herbal-medicine) uses treatments made from plants. It is one of the oldest forms of medicine used around the world. There has not been enough research into herbal medicine to prove it helps asthma. Herbal medicines also have side effects, so talk to your doctor before starting. Herbal medicine is not recommended for use during [pregnancy](/healthyliving/pregnancy). Asthma and Buteyko Buteyko is a therapy that involves different types of breathing exercises. Buteyko breathing exercises may reduce asthma symptoms and the use of reliever medicine. There has not been enough research to confirm this. Any improvements will take time, and require daily exercises over weeks or months. You should keep taking your asthma medicine and speak to your doctor if you are thinking of trying Buteyko. Breathing exercises may improve asthma symptoms for some people. They do not replace reliever medicine when your asthma is getting worse. Always carry your reliever medicine with you, and use it when you need it. Asthma and yoga [Yoga](/yoga-health-benefits) is an ancient Indian practice using movements and breathing techniques to help relaxation and increase fitness. Many people say they find health benefits from practising yoga. Yoga may improve asthma symptoms and may reduce medication use but there has not been enough research to confirm this. Asthma and chiropractic [Chiropractic medicine](/health/conditionsandtreatments/chiropractic) is expert manipulation of the spine. Research has shown it does not improve asthma. Asthma and hypnosis and meditation [Hypnosis](/health/conditionsandtreatments/hypnosis) is a deep state of relaxation. It allows the person to focus their attention on one thing or idea. Hypnosis can be helpful for reducing [stress](/health/healthyliving/stress). Relaxation techniques such as [meditation](/health/conditionsandtreatments/meditation) or mindfulness can also reduce stress. If stress is a trigger for your asthma, these techniques may help. Hypnosis and meditation do not help with the symptoms of asthma. Asthma and homeopathy [Homeopathy](/health/conditionsandtreatments/homeopathy) practitioners believe a substance which causes symptoms, given in very small amounts can stimulate a healing response. This then strengthens the body's ability to heal itself. There is no research that shows homeopathy can help people with asthma. Always talk to your doctor before starting a new complementary therapy.
