Arts/Entertainment ................... 88 Debate over formal organization gathering momentum Sara Voreis The Daily Iowan Just two weeks from a crucial vote that will determine if UI grad\u00b7 uate students will unionize, oppos\u00b7 ing sides of the volatile issue insist the vote will swing their way. And as the vote nears, the debate is getting increasingly heated. The decision to unionize goes up for vote April 16. Supporters say a union would increase graduate students' bar\u00b7 gaining power with ill administra ' tors for tuition waivers, adequate health care benefits, fair working conditions and effective grievance \"/t's important that all 2,600 grad assistants go out and vote and that we leave no doubt.

Wayne Drehs The Daily Iowan After just one year on the job, Angie Lee IS at the top of her pro\u00b7 fession. The Iowa head coach was named 1996 Associated Press Coach of the Year Thursday, edg\u00ad ing out Louisiana Tech's Leon Barmore by two votes. The acco\u00ad lade comes following a 27-4 sea\u00ad son in which the Hawkeyes climbed as high as No.6 in the AP polls, won the regular season Big Ten Conference Title with a 15-1 record, and advanced to the NCAA's Sweet Sixteen. \"I am real surprised,\" Lee said. \"This is a real honor and some\u00b7 thing that I didn't expect. It's a real compliment to my players, assistant coaches and Dr. Grant for giving me this opportunity .w Lee inherited a talent-laden team that finished 11-17 the pre\u00ad vious season under C. Vivian Stringer , and turned things around. Minus Antonia Macklin -Lee managed 16 more wins this season than Stringer did the year before. \"She really found the right team chemistry and unity that kept the team together this year,W senior point guard Karen Clayton said. \"Her young, spirited atti\u00ad tude that she brought to the team caused us to play more relaxed and have more fun.\" Replacing the legendary Iowa coach was no easy task for Lee. She studied under Stringer as an assistant for six years, and played for the twelve year coach for another. In addition, Stringer is Iowa's all-time winningest men's and women's basketball coach, and became the Big Ten's all\u00b7time winningest women's bas\u00b7 ketball coach while at Iowa. \"The idea of replacing Vivian was something that I tried to put out of my mind,\" Lee said. \"I just Pele'Thompson/Th e Daily Iowan Hawkeye women's head Coach Angie Lee waS nanted Coach of the Year by The Associated Press Thursday . The national award, announced at the NCAA Final Four in Charlotte, N.C., comes dur\u00ad ing Lee's first season as head coach. Lee's team made it to the Sweet Sixteen this year, the year after Hawkeye coaching legend C. Vivian Stringer left Iowa to coach at Rutgers. tried to be myself and see where that led me because I felt pre\u00ad pared.\" The true side of Angie Lee was shown prior to the tedms' big weekend in mid February when the then No.7 Hawks played two ranked teams, No.9 Penn State and No. 11 Wisconsin . Lee pulled aside sophomore guard Nadine Domond, who at the time was struggling a bit to ask her what was wrong. \"She told me 'don't be scared',\" Domond said. \"She wanted me to go out and play confident basketball. \" Domond did just that, netting 26 points against the Nittany Lions and 31 against the Bad\u00ad gers, en route to Big Ten player of the week honors. The two vic-tories locked the Big Ten Cham\u00ad pionship for Iowa and also helped the Hawkeyes' quest to host the first two rounds of the NCAA 'lburnament in Iowa City. \"She is real,\" Domond said. \u00b7She's true and honest, and nobody deserves the award more. She really grew and matured here with us.\" The process of getting accli\u00ad mated to coaching in the Big Ten isn't an ellsy one, especially for a first year coach. \"Naturally , I was nervous,\" Lee said. \"It was a nervous of not wanting to Jet the university, the kids, the players, or the commu\u00ad nity down.\" With all this growth in just one sellson, it isn't hard to wonder where Lee will lead this young Hawkeye team that returns all but Clayton next season. \"It would have been a different feeling if we would have been beat in the Sweet Sixteen, but we beat ourselves ,\" Lee said. \"So we definitely want to have higher expectations and be better next year.\" '1 POSSIBLE ,COMIJETITORS 'TEX' MONTGOMERY FAILS TO SHOW IN COURT COGS seeks union ization What: Graduate students who are also Research Assistants or Teaching Assistants can vote on whether they will become affiliated with the United Electrical Workers Union, Local 896.

Iowa Ci y police Chief R~. Winkle hake said the Johnson County Attor\u00ad ney's office will review the report.

Police who searched Glasper on March 12 found no gun and the Hawkeye 's starting guard was questioned and immediately released. After the pedestrian..called police from a cellular phone, alleging Glasper pulled a gun, Glasper said two ICPD officers pulled him over on Iowa Avenue, told him to get out of the car and forcecf him to the ground. The officers held him ~t gunpoint while they searched for a weapon. Glasper has questioned the offi\u00ad cers' procedure while searching him, and said he may presj! charges if the investigation finds the officers did break procedure.

Iowans split on implications of English, only law Ann Haggerty The Daily Iowan When Iowa City resident Juan Gallegos came to the United States three years ago from Mexico City, he chose to take a driver's license test in Spanish because he didn't understand English as well as he does now. However, if the Iowa legislature passes a bill declarin/l Enl(lish the official language .of Iowa, people like Gallegos may have to vote, take driver's tests and conduct any other state business in English.

Amid concerns about straining mental health care funds, the Johnson County Board of Supervi\u00ad sors voted unanimously Thursday Ie approve plans for a new Depart\u00ad ment of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities . Following months of public debate, the plan comes in response to Senate File 69, a state act passed in 1995 aimed at reducing county property taxes for Iowans. The act promises financial aid to Iowa counties for the administra\u00ad tion of mental health programs, but also requires counties to lower property taxes, a large funding source for many county services. The board had until April 1 to r develop a plan in response to the legislation. Linda Severson, Johnson County Human Services coordinator , said though she welcomed the state's interest in funding mental health services, Johnson County has always operated cost-effectively without cutting benefits to its clients. Though Johnson County will maintain its level of mental health services, it might feel the strain of additional administrative costs. \"We feel frustration that we have to implement another layer of IfI\"'I'\" rODAY'S EVENTS Zen Studies Association will spon\u00ad sor a lecture by Taikan Yokoyama of Hiroshima, Japan, at 226 5.

Johnson County Supervisor Sally Stutsman shared Severson's con\u00ad cern with the state mandate . \"/ feel we have a great starting document in response to state legislalion. \" Sally Stutsman, Johnson County supervisor ~Senate File 69 puts a lot of restrictions on the county and how we manage those dollars,\u00b7 she said. \"It's penalizing Johnson County for being cost-effective and having a good system already in place.\" Johnson County received 1.8 mil\u00ad lion in matched-dollar property tax relief from Iowa in fiscal year 1996.

State law, however, requires Iowa counties to provide services for all clients, even if their resi\u00ad dence status is unclear. The coun\u00ad ties cannot collect service fees until that status is determined, and the cost of these services is often absorbed by the counties providing the care. Stutsman said the law benefits smaller counties whose citizens typically use services provided by their larger neighbors. \"If I am a small rural county try\u00ad ing to provide resources for my 9,OOO-person tax base, then why shouldn't I look to the larger coun\u00ad ties that have more growth, more population and more resources for help with what I can't provide to my constituents?\" she said.

The witness, Bill Watt, testified he did so to pressure David Hale to payoff a $10,000 loan he said Hale conned him into taking from Hale's federally backed smail-busi\u00ad ness lending company. Watt testified in the federal trial of Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and Clin\u00ad ton's Whitewater real estate part\u00ad ners James and Susan MCDougal. Hale is expected to be the govern\u00ad ment's chief witness in the trial, which is in its fourth week. On Wednesday, Watt said he was told by Hale that Clinton pressed Hale to complete an $825,000 loan in another transac\u00ad tion which is at the center of the indictment accusing Tucker and the McDougals. Hale also has publicly alleged Clinton pressured him to make a loan of $300,000 in 1986 to Susan McDougal. Clinton has said Hale's tale is Na bunch of bull. W Hale is a former municipal judge in Little Rock. Watt, a traffic judge, said he often acted as Hale's right-hand man, and agreed to take out the $10,000 loan with the understanding Hale would pay it back. Emotional astronauts depart from Mir SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -Atlantis' astronauts clasped hands and exchanged bear hugs with the crew of Russia's Mir space station Thursday, saying farewell as they prepared to leave American Shannon Lucid behind for a five\u00ad month stay. HWe're going to miss them/ choked-up shuttle commander Kevin Chilton said at an official goodbye ceremony aboard the Mir. NASA, meanwhile, ordered Chilton and his crew home Satur\u00ad day, one day earlier than planned, tiecause of a bad weather forecast. Chilton's voice quivered and he paused to regain his composure while explaining why he was espe\u00ad cially sad to leave cosmonauts Yuri Onufrienko and Yuri Usachev. The two crews have known each other for some time because they trained together on the ground. HThere's a big ocean between Russia aod America,\" he said, \"and we're not so confident, or certain I should say, that we'll ever see our two friends Yuri and Yuri again ... in person.\" Same-sex marriages supported by rabbinic group PHILADELPHIA (AP) -A group of Reform rabbis endorsed the legalization of homosexual mar\u00ad riages Thursday but stopped short of recommending rabbis perform the ceremonies. The l,750-member Central Conference of American Rabbis is the first major group of Jewish leaders to formally oppose govern\u00ad ment bans on same-sex marriages. NAs Jews, and specifically in the reform movement, we've always expressed concern for those we feel aren't treated fairly,\" said Rab\u00ad bi Robert Klensin of Arnold, Md., before an overwhelming voice vote. Most of the comments during the vigorous debate centered on an\u00b7amendment specifying the gtoup was not deciding the contro\u00ad versial issue of rabbis officiating over Single-sex ceremonies. Myou cannot call upon the state to allow these marriages and then refuse to perform the marriage, W said Rabbi Eric Wisnia of Princeton Junction, N.J. But Rabbi Simeon Maslin, the conference president, said the res\u00ad olution Nis a matter of civil rights. It is certainly not connected to any question of rabbinic officiation.\" Maslin said the organization expects to vote on single-sex mar\u00ad riage officiation at next year's meeting in Denver. CCAR voted six years ago to accept gay and lesbian rabbis. Nation & World Line .. item veto means more power for president Tom bum Associated Press WASHINGTON -Presidents since Jefferson have bemoaned the lack of power to strike specific items from spending bills. Now a Republican Congress and a Democratic president are provid\u00ad ing that line-item veto, shifting vital purse-string powers to the White House. Budget politics may never be the same -if courts uphold the con\u00ad stitutionality of the measure Presi\u00ad dent Clinton is poised to sign. Sent to Clinton on Thursday by the House, the legislation could open every line of the federal budget to partisan assault. One analyst said a president could use the power \"as a ham\u00ad mer,\" threatening to veto dam pro\u00ad jects or federal buildings in a law\u00ad maker's district unless he support\u00ad ed the White House on other issues. It marks the biggest shift of power from one branch of govern\u00ad ment to another since 1974, when Congress passed legislation to stop then-President Nixon from \"impounding\" -or refusing to spend -money on projects he dis\u00ad liked. Democratic Congresses routinely brushed aside pleas by GOP Presi\u00ad dents Reagan and Bush for line\u00ad item veto authority . But this year the stars lined up in the political firmament, with Republicans including the line\u00ad item veto in their \"Contract with America\" and Democratic Presi\u00ad dent Clinton eagerly embracing it. 'Ib try to get beyond the presi\u00ad dential election, and to satisfy GOP misgivings over handing such powers to Clinton, both sides agreed to make the effective date next Jan. 1. Thus, Republicans are betting Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the expected GOP nominee, will be the first to use the new powers. And Democrats are hoping Clinton will be able to exercise them as he begins a second term. The legislation will permit a president for the first time to can\u00ad cel specific programs or projects from spending bills and to strike narrowly targeted special-interest tax breaks. Among some more recent items Clinton would have stricken had he already had such powers, according to the Office of Manage\u00ad ment and Budget: Some $58 million in a 1995 agricultural bill in grants for uni\u00ad versity research programs Clinton opposed. Various projects attached to a defense spending bill Clinton signed because it contained funds for U.S. troops in Bosnia; $70 mil\u00ad lion in what Clinton deemed \"wasteful spending\" in a separate military-construction bill. Some $1.1 billion for 14 dam and other construction projects which were part of a 1995 spend\u00ad ing bill on energy and water devel\u00ad opment. Congressional sponsors and CliJ1ton portrayed the line-item veto as an important tool for presi\u00ad dential control over spending, allowing him to strike down \"pork\u00ad barrel\" projects. But Stanley Collender, a budget expert at Price Waterhouse, an accounting firm, doubts the mea\u00ad sure will have much overall impact on reducing federal deficits . Instead, he said, it simply shifts power to the White House and allows a president to \"use it as a hammer over Congress' head.\" \"The president will be in a posi\u00ad tion to trade projects for votes,\" Collender said, suggesting a presi\u00ad dent could threaten to veto a spe\u00ad cific project -say a dam or federal building -if the member of Con\u00ad gress from that state or district didn't vote a certain way. Forty-three states give their gov\u00ad ernors such line-item veto powers. As Arkansas governor for 12 years, Clinton had it, though be exercised it rarely. But critics say the issues are dif\u00ad ferent on the national level. \"You don't have in the states the same extent of the separation of powers that is 80 critical to nation\u00ad al government,\" said Gary Bass, executive director of OMB Watch, a citizens' group which monitors budget issues. \"I think it's a mistake to give the president so much power.\" Congress did vote to require the act to be renewed after eight years -giving lawmakers another shot if they decide they've given up too much authority.

But he doesn't listen.\" Relaxing at the couple's villa in Gaza City, Suba Ararat spoke with the AP about the challenges sbe faces as the wife of one of tbe world's most controversial leaders -and as a Westernized woman living in a male-dominated commu\u00ad nity that thrives on gossip. \"Being the wife of Vasser Arafat means you have to pay for everything you do. \" Suha Arafat, on life with the PLO leader \"There's a lot of stress around me.

But she has been determined to make a home for her family in Gaza. She has weathered the jibes S VOTES SHORT Minimum wage boost thwarted by Republicans Marcy Gordon Associated Press WASHINGTON -Congressional Democrats failed again Thursday to force a vote on raising the mini\u00ad mum wage, but promised to keep the issue alive this election year and challenge Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. Republicans accused them of political opportunism and partisan attacks on Dole, who is President Clinton's certain election rival. Knowing they face a tough fight, the minority Democrats said they'll try again and again to bring up the issue, which they are framing in terms of family values. \"The fact is the Republican Party has declared a war on working families,\u00b7 Dole's counterpart, Sen\u00ad ate Minority Leader Thm DaschJe, D-S.D., told reporters berore the Democrats tried for votes in both the House and Senate. \"This war on working families has got to stop.\" In a 55-45 taUy on the Senate floor, the Democrats fell five votes short of the 60 needed to shut off debate and force a vote on an amendment, proposed by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to national parks legislation. The amendment would boost the mini\u00ad mum wage from the current $4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour in two 45- cent steps over the next two years, Despite the setback, key Democ\u00ad rats later told reporters they were encouraged by the size of the vote in their favor and its bipartisan character . \"We have more than enough votes to pass minimum wage,\" Daschle said. \"Sooner or lat\u00ad er, this will pass .... We'll be back offering this week after week until we get it passed.\" Across the Capitol in the House, Republicans beat back two attempts by Democrats to attach an increase in the minimum wage to a measure increasing the gov\u00ad ernment's borrowing authority. Both were procedural motions. Republicans defeated one of them by ruling that raising the mini\u00ad mum wage would violate a \"Con\u00ad tract With America\" law enacted Ja.t year that forbids tpe federal government from imposing regula\u00ad tions on local governments without compensating them for their cost. The Republicans \"are doing pro\u00ad cedural pirouettes to avoid a real debate and preventing the public from seeing where they really stand on this issue,\" Labor Secre\u00ad tary Robert Reich said in an inter\u00ad view. \"At a minimum, the public deserves to have its representa\u00ad ttv. stand up and be counted.\" of Palestinians shocked by her expensive tastes and by her deci\u00ad sion to deliver her baby in Paris and hire a British nanny. \"r used to feel hurt by the criti\u00ad cism, but now I don't care,\" she said. \"Being the wife of Yasser Ararat means you have to pay for everything you do.\" \"In Paris, I can live without hav\u00ad ing all eyes watch ing me critically,\" she said. \"Here, if I went to a shop, people would say, 'She bought the whole boutique.' \" Suha Arafat said she spends much of her time reading French and English historical novels, entertaining foreign visitors and receiving Palestinians who need problems solved. She also has stepped in to help her hu.sband: Through her contacts in France, she has managed to get 750 tons of wheat into Gaza this month to help relieve the siege Israel imposed on the strip after a spate of suicide bombings . Suha Arafat, a Palestinian Christian and the daughter of a West Bank journalist, met her hus\u00ad band while working as his secre\u00ad tary at PLO headquarters in Tunisia in the late 19BOs. In 1991, she married the then- 60-year-old revolutionary in a secret ceremony in Tunis. Setting up house has not been easy.

'\" New drug dramatically reduces chances of brain damage in stroke patients , \"ljI \" Daniel Haney Associated Press ~OSTON -An experimental new drug powerfully protects stroke victims from catastrophic brain damage and may someday be given to virtually all such patients, researchers say. Strokes are the nation's No.3 killer after heart disease and can\u00ad cer, striking about 500,000 Ameri\u00ad cans annually. Until recently, there was no treatment. Now it appears \"jUalflg'4\"111a State prepares to kill sea lions as activists sue in federal court Robert Saiz Holguin Associated Press SEATTLE -Like gluttonous courtiers around a banquet table, fat California sea lions have been lolling about at Seattle's Ballard Locks, gorging themselves on the s~eelhead salmon struggling to make their way upstream. Now the state is going to put an epd to the royal pigout. With the fish runs depleted, and much of the blame put on the port\u00ad ly pinnipeds, the state got federal approval earlier this month to shoot two of the more voracious sea lions, a move which has drawn ani\u00ad n)al-rights protests and pleas to the governor. \"Nobody wants to kill sea lions, but this is just a matter of priori\u00ad ties,\u00b7 Kathleen South of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife said. \"It's just reached a very criti\u00ad ~ point.\" The sea lions are protected by federal law but are neither a threatened nor endangered species. The bewhiskered behemoths tar\u00ad geted for death have been identi\u00ad fied by the state as Nos. 17 and 225. No. 17 is Hondo, the only one of the pack to be named and the biggest sea lion on record at 1,084 pounds. Adult males normally run 750 to 1,000 pounds. If state agents spot Nos. 17 or 225, they can shoot the animal with a bullet or a lethal dose of tranquilizers . As of Wednesday, no shots had been fired. Every year, as salmon make their way from saltwater Shilshole Bay on Puget Sound to freshwater Lake Union and Lake Washington, they are delayed by the Ballard Locks, where they have to climb a fish ladder. The setting is a smorgasbord for hungry sea lions, some of which just sit and wait for lunch to swim by and devour the 25-to 30-inch spawning fish. As many as 120 sea lions gather at the locks during the April-May steelhead run. Animal-rights activists say the locks are the problem -not the sea lions. They are calling instead for major changes, including new fish ladders, so sea lions and salmon can co-exist. \"It's ridiculous to think that kllling sea lions is going to restore the salmon runs. There are far worse problems at issue here,\u00b7 said Will Anderson of the Progressive Animal Welfare Society's Seattle chapter. \"Killing them won't solve apything.\" PAWS and the Humane Society of the United States have asked Gov. Mike Lowry to intervene. On Thursday, those two groups a~d the Earth Island Institute announced they were suing in fed\u00ad eral court in Washington, D.C., to stop any sea lion killings.

Now, another team has found a different medicine seems to work just as well and may be useful for many more patients. \"This is definitely the most excit\u00ad ing time ever in the history of strokes: Karen Putney, vice presi\u00ad dent of the National Stroke Associ\u00ad ation, said. The new drug, citicoline, is the first of a group of so-called neuro\u00ad protective drugs which shield the brain from a destructive chain reaction started by a stroke. In a study, the drug appeared to limit the size of the stroke, speed up recovery and improve victims' men\u00ad tal functioning . Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Lexington, Mass., makers of citicoline, paid for the study. Especially noteworthy are the medicine's lack of side effects and its apparent success even when given to a patient many hours after stroke symptoms start. TPA, in comparison, must be giv\u00ad en within three hours of the start of symptoms. Even when used properly, 6 percent of patients suf\u00ad fer disastrous bleeding inside their brains. Because of the drug's limi-tations, most stroke patients prob\u00ad ably will not be able to take it. Citicoline, it appears, could be much more widely used. \"Because it's so safe and can be given up to 24 hours after a stroke, I think it will be an important breakthrough,\u00b7 said Dr. Wayne Clark, who headed the team which tested the drug at 21 hospitals.

Head men's Coach Ted Wheeler said there are a number of current and former athletes with visions of Atlanta dancing in their heads, including alum Anthuan Maybank. Maybank, who is running for Ijike and has been training in Cali\u00ad fornia with long jumper Mike Pow\u00ad ell, among others, has already been projected as an Olympian in either the 200-or 400-meters . \"The most important thing we try to do is make sure they keep some clarity and focus and not have things put pressure on them.\" UI track coach Ted Wheeler Morris qualified for the Olympic trials in the 400-meters with a time of 45.15 last year and current\u00ad ly ranks seventh in the United States in that event. The top six finishers will make the team. The Hawkeyes may also be well\u00ad represented on the Canadian National team. Dion Trowers, Chris Davis and Monte Raymond are all in a posi\u00ad tion to make the team.

According to a 1990 Iowa Census, there are about 1,250 people in the state who don't speak English at all and around 12,170 people who don't speak English well. Davis said he also has a chance to qualify in the 200, but is focus\u00ad ing on his stronger event -the 400. \"(My chances are) pretty good,\" Davis said. \"If everything goes well, I have a pretty good chance. I just need to stay focused.n The Hawkeyes should also be represented on the Indian national team by 1993 graduate Rajeev Balkrishnan. Balkrishnan has run the 400- intermediate hurdles in 50.7 sec\u00ad onds, and needs to run 60.54 to make the Olympics. At least three other Hawkeyes are also hoping to make the Olympic Trials and have an outside shot at the Olympic team. Former Hawkeye Kevin Herd, as well as current members George Page and Bashir Yamini, are set\u00ad ting their sights on the trials. Herd is hoping to qualify in the 10K, Page in the 200 or 400\u00b7meter dash and Yamini in the long jump.

Congress has stepped out a/bounds by interfering in the internal policies 0/ other nations and forcing American policies. me u.s. Congress is getting out of control. Acting more like a : body made up of an impllll8ioned and vindictive mob, the current Congress is acting more and more as if it were the legislative body for the whole world -without having been elected to such a position. The way American legislators are attempting to control the world is rather creative. Basically , they pass legislation setting U.S. priorities In a particular field -fighting drugs, for instance. However, the same legislation requires the president to make annual determinations as to whether other nations are meeting U.S. expectations in fighting drugs In their own countries . If a country is determined by the United States to have failed to meet the requirements set forth in American laws, U.S. foreign aid to that nation is cut, or, worse, that nation's access to the American mar\u00ad ket is curtailed. Through this type oflegislation the United States is, in effect, imposing its priorities on other hapless nations. American legislators Iu'e imposing their values and priorities on other nations without those nations having any input. Other countries are not told directly what they must do -that would be too blatant a violation of intern a\u00ad lionallaw . Instead, they are told to do as Americans wish,lest they Msh to peril economically . In an alarming amount of legislation, Congress is resorting to this type of coercive measure in order to shape the internal policies of oth\u00ad er nations. For instance, in the recent, mindless expansion of sanc\u00ad ~ons against Cuba, law permits Cuban-Americans to sue non-Ameri \u00ad can corporations for the alleged use of their former properties in Cuba. Some foreign executives doing business in Cuba are also prohibited from coming to the United States. American law may control the behavior of American corporations in foreign countries . However , American law may not control the behav\u00ad ior of foreign companies doing business in other countries. The rest of the world does not agree with the new sanctions imposed by the Unit\u00ad ~ States at the urgings of politically powerful Cuban-Americans. There is great resentment towards the practice of exposing non\u00ad Ame.rican companies to liability in U.S. courts. The United States is trying to force a change in the policies of other nations vis-lI-vis Cuba. :rhis is unacceptable. The European Union and Canada have chal\u00ad 'enged this overreach by Congress in the World Trade Organization. Since the end of World War II, America has done much to make the -world a better place. In the past, however, America provided incen\u00ad tives to nations doing the right thing. In the post-Cold War era, a vin\u00ad 'dictive, almost mean, streak of Americans has appeared on the world stage. No longer worried about the Soviets, America is taking its friends for granted. American law currently imposes senseless, often mean-hearted punishment on other nations for exercising their sover\u00ad eign rights. This cavalier attitude will get the United States more ene\u00b7 pries and little respect. , This global overreach by the American Congress is giving rise to the Unage of an arrogant America -in great contrast to the generous peo\u00ad ple Americans have always been.

He has recently been reinstated , only after agreeing to stand and pray during the ceremony. Tysie McDowell This is a very clear sign of oppression. The NBA has a rule stating \"all players are to stand in an orderly fashion in honor of the National Anthem.\" This country was founded on freedom of expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion, but today, freedom seems to be con\u00b7 nected to a very short leash. There is little reason why any person of African descent should honor the National Anthem. The lyrics pertain to European -Ameri\u00ad cans only. As Abdul-Rauf said, \"it is a sign of oppression and tyranny.\" The song was written at a time when Mricana people were property and it is a song about freedom which was obtained solely by and for whites. I am not surprised by the NBA's decision to suspend Abdul-Rauf . All American institutions perpetuate the norms and values of the main\u00ad stream culture. What I am frustrated with is the passiveness of the Mricana NBA players. Many players announced they supported Abdul\u00ad Rauf, yet they continued to run up and down the court, jumping and dunking every time their master said so. Instead of standing firm in their beliefs, the players backed down and let brother Abdul-Rauffight this one alone. U-N-I-T-Y! The NBA is almost 75 percent Mricana. We must begin to realize our potential power when it comes to situations like these.

Riding the wave of fan loyaltY A snapshot from spring break: I'm having lunch with a friend I haven't seen in more than a year. We're comparing experiences, telling scandalous tales of mutual friends, when I start detailing my return to college. My friend stops me and asks, \"Have you become a Hawkeye fan yet?\" The answer to my friend's question is no, not really. The likelihood of my becoming passion\u00ad ately attached to the Hawkeye basketball or football team is approximately equal to my becoming passionately attached to the UI Chemistry Department. The widely chronicled adventures of this institution's athletic teams simply have nothing to do with why I'm here today and what I'm doing now. It's not that r don't like sports. I do. I'm addicted. I had to force myself to put down this week's issue of Sporting News to work on this column. It's just that it's too late in my life to form new fan loy\u00ad alties. But the question got me to thinking about just what fan loyalty is. Over the last 20 years, the rise of adversarial sports journalism, the influence of cable televi\u00ad sion and the fabulous amounts of money to be made in the industry have raised fandom to something far beyond the simple leisure-time diversion it was for the better part of a hundred years. Everybody, it seems, needs somebody to follow. Here in Iowa, it's the Hawkeyes .

In a scathing report bound to fuel efforts to make Shin Bet more accountable, the inquiry found the organization was primarily to blame for failing to prevent the prime minister's Nov. 4 assassina\u00ad tion. 'WASHINGTON -President Clfuton for' a violent or dfug-related crime in public hous\u00b7 ing, declaring a \"one strike and you're outW rule was needed to mllke such housing safe.

Issued a day after assassin Yigal Amir was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, the report confirmed the widespread impres\u00ad sion the assassination was the result of a security breakdown that could have been prevented. It was the harshest criticism ever leveled at the service, which in the past has sometimes dodged accountability by cloaking itself in secrecy. Some of that cover has already been removed: In January, the new Shin Bet chief, Ami Ayalon, became the first head of the agency to be publicly identified while in the post.

But that won't happen in my administration . I'll sign the good bills and veto the bad bills.\" But Democrats were already promising a bitter fight. \"This group is extremist and rad\u00b7 ical.\" House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri said.

So what are the volunteers say\u00ad ing? \"It's about split on whether we want Mr. Perot to run,\" said C. W. Miller. president of Perot's United We Stand organization in Iowa. In a straw poll held at the group's meeting last month , nearly 70 percent backed current Republi\u00b7 can presidential ---candidate Pat ~_1Ij Buchanan, Miller said. Like Per\u00ad ot, Buchanan opposes free trade agree\u00ad ments such as the North American Free Trade \"\"=======::=====~ Agreement . While some former Perot voters may not like Buchanan's views on social issues -he is pro-life - nearly all agree with his economic policy. \"There may be some dissent on abortion,\" Miller said, \"but most of the rest (of Buchanan's agenda) is all right.\" Buchanan has hinted he may run as a third\u00b7party candidate if he is not satisfied by how he is treated at the Republican National Con\u00ad vention in San Diego this August. Perot's Reform Party will hold its national convention on Labor Day, so if Buchanan wants to bail out of the GOP, he will have an opportu\u00b7 nity waiting. Meanwhile , with appearances on \"Larry King Live\" and a nation\u00b7 wide speaking tour that began this week, Perot has been acting more and more like a presidential candi\u00b7 date. Neither a Perot nor a Buchanan candidacy has much appeal to GOP nominee\u00b7to-be Bob Dole. Perot could siphon votes from the Repub\u00b7 lican ticket just as he did against George Bush in 1992, and Buchanan could cut down on Dole's support from Christian conserva\u00b7 tives. So even though Dole has his par\u00ad ty's nomination wrapped up early, he will have to wait all summer to know who his third-party chal\u00ad lengers will be. Once again, the major parties are waiting for Perot. Easy being treen? While potential Perot and Buchanan candidacies would hurt Dole, another already real, third\u00ad party challenge may hurt Presi\u00ad dent Bill Clinton. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader is running for president in several states under the Green Party ban\u00ad ner. Nader could do the most dam\u00b7 age to Clinton in California -a state the president must win. Some liberal Democrats thought Clinton's State of the Union address sounded too conservative. Civil libertarians did not appreci\u00ad ate Clinton's advocacy of the V-chip for television program blocking and his support of uniforms for school students. Nader may win enough votes from American Civil Liberties Union members and disaffected Democrats in California to jeopar\u00ad dize the key to Clinton's campaign. GUDB and money The U.S. House of Representa \u00b7 tives passed a bill last week to repeal the assault weapons ban, but the vote had more to do with the 1996 campaign than the Can\u00b7 stitutional right to bear arms. Opponents of the ban knew the Senate would not even take up the measure, and a Clinton veto was a guarantee. So why bother with a vote? Because gun control is a popular campaign issue, politicians on both sides of the issue want to let the public know where they stand. It also helps candidates raise cam\u00ad paign contributions from such organizations as the National Rifle Association, an organization oppos\u00ad ingthe ban. As November nears, expect Con\u00ad gress to take more votes on issues that are sure to rile voters and excite political action committees.

'96 season takes the plate You've read all the preseason magazines, now it's time to read the DI, the ultimate authority on the upcoming baseball season. I can see how ~~~==~~ deciphering 1996 can be a difficult task: Free agency, six divisions, no commis\u00ad sioner. All you need is knowledge of the game and familiarity with its histo\u00ad ry and you, too, can make a fool of your\u00ad self. But admit it, that's part of the fun. Let's not forget that last season Hawkeyes attempt to recover at home Shannon Stevens The Daily Iowan It's time for the Iowa baseball team to clean house. After mustering only eight hits in a mid-week split with the Mankato State Mavericks, the Hawkeyes (6-5) are hoping to record their first sweep of the sea\u00ad son when they host Northwestern for a four-game seriea this week\u00ad end at Iowa Field. Northwestern enters the game with a 10-8 record and features two strong hitters in Jake Suffian and Mike Stritch. Suffian is hitting .471 over his last eight games with 17 RBI. Stritch is the team's power source with seven home runs. In addition to strong hitting, the Wildcats possess a strong pitching prospect in junior Brad Brasser (2.45 ERA). The Wildcats were also third in the Big Thn Conference in pitching a year ago, allowing just over three runs per nine innings. The Hawkeyes will attempt to counter Northwestern's pitching with some offensive weapons of their own. Senior Colin Mattiace and junior Ryan Sienko have each homered four times in the first 11 games. Mattiace is also the team's batting leader (.500) followed by junior C. J. Thieleke (.457). Mattiace, who also pitches for Iowa, said he was glad to get in some plate appearances after not taking any at bats in 1995. I picked four-of-six division win\u00ad ners and both Cy Young Award winners. Of course, I also picked the 62-81 Cardinals to take the wildcard and last-place San Fran\u00ad cisco to win its division, but let's not think about that. Instead, let's focus on the pre\u00ad sent. Enough intro, it's time to find who's going to win what and by how much. ALEut Simply put Baltimore is loaded. The Orioles are going to prove that a combination of free agency and a strong farm system is the way to go. Atlanta was the first to prove this little theory.

Nebraska , no stranger to win\u00ad ning it all in football, salvaged what looked like a horrible regu\u00ad lar season by winning the nation's oldest postseason tournament at Madison Square Garden. The Cornhuskers (21-14) looked to be in control with a 41-28 lead with 16:36 to play. But the Hawks (19-13), playing in front of 30 bus\u00ad loads of students who made the 100-mile trip from Philadelphia, tied the game at 47-47. St. Joseph's, which has never won a national title in basketball, used a 14-2 run to draw. even, with reserve Thrrell Myers scoring half the points. The run included an i~tentional foul against Nebras\u00ad ka's Tyronn Lue that turned into a five-point play. But Nebraska didn't let the Hawks go ahead and the 6-foot-11 Moore gave the Cornhuskers a 55- 49 lead when he dunked and was fouled. He missed the free throw for the three-point play, but he grabbed the rebound, was fouled and made two free throws with 5:27 left. Nebraska wouldn't score again until there were 40 seconds left, but Moore was there on the de fen-\"I've been hitting a lot more this year and that keeps me more active,' he said. \"When you're only Associilted Press Nebraska guard Erick Strickland passes during the NIT championship game in New York Thursday.

We had a lot of errors last year and errors to me represent lack of concentra\u00ad tion pitch to pitch and that's something we have to be better with.\" The Hawkeyes hold a lifetime 37-23 advantage over the Wolver\u00ad ines, including a 9-7 win in the second round of last year's Col\u00ad lege World Series. \"They did lose a couple of very big contributors , but their young kids got a lot of experience last year and they got a good recruit\u00ad ing class that are already in the line-up for them,\" Blevins said. \"They're going to be pretty good. It will be a tough series for us.\" The Wolverines won the Big Ten regular season title last year and the Big Ten 'lburnament, beating Iowa twice in the tournament. The Hawkeyes are hoping to turn things around this season. \"There's a lot of excitement going into Big Ten's,\" Reents said. \"Big Ten's are huge. (Winning the Big Ten regular season title is) our main goal this year. That's the title we want. That shows we can be consistent day in and day out.\" The regular season winner is the Big Ten champion, but the tournament champion gets the Big Ten's automatic bid to the NCAA 'lburnament. \"m\"6',;ltitll\"\"#I\" Hawks head for Florida sunshine Chris James The Daily Iowan The Bun and fun of spring break hasn't totally ended for the Iowa women's track team.

McCarty then ended the fall season by recording his season's best finish at the North\u00ad ern Invitational for ninth place, just one stroke behind Brantner . The meet is the first since a fall season in which the Hawkeyes' performance was a disappointing Despite the poor team perfor\u00ad mance this fall, juniors Laine Brantner and Chad McCarty did have strong individual seasons and will look to carry the team this spring. Brantner was the teams leader throughout the season, EVEAT 7:00& 9:00 SAT & SUN MATS 1:30&4:0D OUrER ~ ejgsg~ EVE AT 7:10\u00b7 SAT & SUN SUN'.PG- SPI KE LEE'S 'GI RL 6' -R- EVE AT 9:30.

After losing two-of-three match\u00ad es in California, Iowa women's ten\u00ad nis coach Jenny Mainz decided it was time to shuflle the lineup. Mainz hopes a switch at the No. 1 doubles position will cure the Hawkeyes' Big'Thn Conference woes when Iowa (B-7) travels to Illinois and Purdue (6-3) this weekend. Junior Kristen McCracken and freshman Erin Wolverton (3-6) will move from No.2 doubles to the top spot with Sasha Boros and Krissy Campbell (3-9) taking over the No. 2 position. \"I've always said that people have to earn their positions and Erin and Kris have certainly earned the opportunity to play the No.1 spot,\u00b7 Mainz said. junior Robin Niemeier from a back' ------------- injury should help bolster the. \"I've always said that people have to earn their positions and Erin and Kris have certainly earned the opportunity to play the No. 1 spot. /I Jenny Mainz, Iowa coach on Eri n Wolverton and Kristen McCracken The Hawkeyes have dropped all three of their Big Ten matchups thus far, but Mainz is confident that the losing streak will end this weekend. Mainz said the recent return of Hawkeye attack. \"Robin Niemeier is an impact player for us, even though she's not playing in the top of the lineup,\u00b7 Mainz said. \"She knows how to compete and when it's close I'm\" going to put my money on Robin.\" Mainz said the Hawkeyes should have no problem if they play con\u00ad sistently, but stressed that they must come prepared for the match. \"There are a lot of teams out ;., there that are deceptive, they're .,., scrappy,\u00b7 she said. \"The key is that, - they find a way to win and I think . we have to improve in that area' and say 'Hey, we're not having a great day but it doesn't matter, , we're going to find a way to win anyway.'\" Daily Specials at it's best!

Roger Clemens is impossible to project. Six-foot-five righty Aaron Sele could be a mon\u00ad ster, but only time will tell. And as for the Yankees, they lost team leader Don Mattingly and added one man who will drag New York kicking and screaming to the middle of the pack: Manager Joe \u00b7Thrre. ALCentral Cleveland's going to win. ,-OK, with that out of the way, let's discuss who's going to finish second. Minnesota finished dead Ill;St a season ago. The 'I\\vins also played poor in 1986 and finished last in '90. A year later they won the series. But in those years there was no juggernaut known as the Indians. Come September, Minny will be fighting Seattle tooth and nail for the wildcard while another mem\u00ad ber of the Central -Chicago -will again try to figure out what went wrong. The White Sox offseason add i- : tions were all to protect the best player in the last 15 years, Frank Thomas. Danny Tartabull , Tony Phillips, Harold Baines; it doesn't matter. As a manager, Terry Bev\u00ad ington is pathetic. Associated Press Los Angeles' Hideo Nomo Milwaukee will be decent, but will take fourth by default. Kansas City, behind Oakland, may be the AVs worst team. The Royals lost Gary Gaetti, Wally Joyner and leader Greg Gagne. Who'd they : add? Former Dodger Jose Offer\u00ad man, the worst defensive infielder in the NL over the past four sea\u00ad sOns. ALWeat Seattle couldn't have been more foolish by trading Tino Martinez , and letting Vince Coleman and Andy Benes slip away. Without Martinez' presence, pitchers can work around Jay Buhner, and if he's avoided, Ken Griffey, Jr.'s path Baseball Associated Press Baltimore 's Roberto Alomar, front, and Cal Ripken toward the MVP is seriously impeded. Enter California. A young and hungry Angels lineup will devour money-hungry Seattle. Tim Salmon is ready for superstar sta\u00ad tus, J.T. Snow is solid, but not all\u00ad star caliber and Jim Edmonds is the best-kept secret in the majors. Playoffs Baltimore sweeps Minnesota; Cleveland does the same to the Angels. The Indians dump the Orioles in six games. NLEast See\" AL Central\" -replace \"Cleveland\" with \"Atlanta.\u00b7 After the Braves, the East is a mediocre division. The remaining four squads each have one very sol\u00ad id attribute and a negative that will keep them from the postsea\u00ad son. Florida has youth and talent; and with the addition of Devon White, it now has leadership. What the Marlins don't have is a super\u00ad star, the taste of success and a sol\u00ad id rotation. They did add Kevin Brown, but his 10-9 record last season with Baltimore gives him the highest winning percentage of any Florida starter. The Mets have three amazing young starters: Jason Isring\u00ad hausen, Bill Pulsipher and Paul Wilson are New York's future. Unfortunately, an anorexic lineup is the Mets' present. Montreal has Felipe Alou at the helm, but it takes more than a manager and his son, Moises, to win ball games. And Philadelphia? Well, opposing batters might as well be hitting off tees. NLCentral Contrary to popular belief, the Reds -not st. Louis -will win the Central. The difference between Davey Johnson and new manager Ray Knight is the differ\u00ad ence between Bach and Biz Mar\u00ad quee, but they've got one of the best captains in baseball in Barry Larkin. Reds Larkin, Hal Morris, Chris Saho, Eric Davis and a host of oth\u00ad ers have all tasted the postseason, a major advantage over the other Central clubs. The Cardinals and Cubs -yes, Chicago -will be the front run\u00ad ners for the NL wildcard. St. Louis, playing under new ownership and on natural grass, spent the money on monster free agents Ron Gant, Andy Benes and a cast of seeming\u00ad ly thousands . It also hired 1bny La Russa as manager, which is the reason the Cards will edge out Chicago, emotionally led by Ryne Sandberg . NLWest Give the edge to the Dodgers, but San Diego could surprise. And if you think excluding Colorado was an accident, think again. The Rockies have no pitching staff. Actually, they could sign the ghosts of Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson and still not have a staff. Coors Field is a nightmare for pitchers. The Padres added Rickey Hen\u00ad derson and Wally Joyner to solidify their lineup and give Thny GWYM some help, but L.A. is simply too strong and too well coached. Hideo Nomo won't be as dominant now that major leaguers have had a chance to see him once, but he'll still finish a few games over .500. Playoffs Atlanta drops St. Louis three games to one; Los Angeles over the Reds in five. Lasorda's boys pull off the upset in seven games. World Series Cleveland won't be denied again.

SurViving it might be a better word. Nathan Groepper The Daily Iowan Look out, Babyface . Impressive debuts from artists D'Angelo and Tony Rich have set the world of rhythm and blues on ita ear. Although their sounds a.re dis\u00ad tinctly different, both have com\u00ad bined a feel with today's slick crooning to pro\u00b7 duce two of the most original albums in years. Previously known for writing the Boyz II Men tune \"I Sit Away,\" Rich is on a mission to put the blues back in R&B. On his debut album Words, Rich crafts classy and sorrow-filled songs which seem out of sync with his blatant, sex\u00b7filled counterparts. While Boyz II Men belt out \"I'll make love to you,\" Rich subtly suggests \"I'll make you feel like a woman.\" The insurgent and inventive filmmake r's new movie opened t.o poor reviews and weak sales, a planned Jackie Robinson biography just fell apart when a studio balked over ita price tag and Lee's previ\u00ad ous release, \"Clockers,\" underper\u00ad for.med badly at the box office_ Lee was criticized in Brazil for his participation in making a music video for Michael Jackson earlier this year. Police said a drug lord p1ayed host to Jackson and Lee When they shot the video in his Brazilian slum. Lee said they did npt \"knowingly\" work with drug dealers. AsscxUted Press Spike Lee has just released \"Girl 6, \" another trademark controversial film, which opened to poor reviews and weak sales. Rich establishes this mature, intimate feel which surrounds the entire album through careful, intricate execution. From \"Grass is Green,\" seen from the point of view of a misunderstoo d criminal, to the up\u00b7tempo \"Hey Blue,\" the emphasis is on intelligent lyrics and multi-layere d harmonies _ Spike Lee and controversy is not new. The poor performance of his ~viesis . In its first weekend of national release, \"Gid 6\" fmished seventh oa the box-office charts with $2.5 million_ Tellingly, ita open\u00ad ing weekend per-screen average was worse than that of \"Up Close and Personal,\" playing in ita fourth weekend. Outside of 1992's \"Malcolm X,\" none of Lee's last five films have done spectacularly well at ticket windows . Despite good reviews, \"Clockers\" made mil\u00b7 lion. Lee complains more is expected of him than other filmmakers : because he is an outspoken squeaky wheel, his films must be superior just t.o be judged mediocre . Once a darling of film critics, reviewers have turned particularly nasty, and some of the \"Girl 6\" cri\u00ad tiques were quite personal. \"I can take any shot (any critics) want to take,\" Lee says. \"What I will say is that a lot of times these critics don't do what their job is. And that is review the film at hand: \"A lot of times they review the persona of Spike Lee, what they feel about Spike Lee. I don't know how my being court side at Knicks games can end up in a review of my films. Look at the first movie Woody Allen made after the whole (adoption ) thing. Nobody men\u00b7 tioned (anything )\" Part of the problem might be that Lee is overexposed and does too many TV advertisementa . How can he be taken seriously as an artist, the argument goes, when Lee has gone so corporate -down to his $1,000 basketballseata? \"Girl 6,\" Lee's new film, follows an aspiring actress (Theresa Ran\u00b7 dIe) who dreams of moving to Hoi\u00b7 lywood.

Of all of Lee's films since his first movie, 1986's \"She's Gotta \"Girl 6\" is the \"I my films are depar\u00ad tures, I really do,\" Lee says. \"I think if Bomeone took the time to go see 'Girl 6' Friday night and then rented 'She's ers,' would see a progression. They are all different stories.\" Even for a well-known director, it was a very difficult movie to get made. Lee did not take the script to Universal Pictures, where he had a deal, and then Miramax said it would make it and then backed out. \"Girl 6\" finally was made at Fox Searchlight , an art-film divi\u00b7 sion of 20th Century Fox. This can be clearly experience d on \"Missing You.\" Here, Rich spins his expert craftsmanship into a delicate ballad which is as good as anything you will hear this year from Babyface or anyone else in the R&B industry. With his sparse goatee and black leather jacket, D'AngelQ appears to be Rich's flamboyant, dangerous older brother. On his debut Brown Sugar, D'Angelo sparked interest with his tradi\u00ad tional, bluesy sound. Where Rich uses a drum machine and synthe\u00ad sizer, D'Angelo dazzles on the piano and bass. The result sounds more old-fashioned and removed. D'Angelo accomplishes thjs HUNGRY HOBO Sun. -Thure. 10:30 -10:00 Fri. -Sat. 10:30 -11:00 6 Days Only 1 LARGE PIZZA UNLIMITED TOPPINGS* Load it Up! *No Double Toppings Expires March 31, 1996 bygone feel with the subtle, pow\u00ad erful arrangement of his instru\u00ad ments. On \"Crusin' Hand \"Jonz in My Bonz,\" D'Angelo handles the swing to infectious perfection, melting his voice around the glowing har\u00ad monies. As with Rich's Words, Brown Sugar's gliding vocals and 12.10 ..... rna. ga.. relaxed instrumentals take some getting used to. 'If you are patient, you will Boon find D'Angelo's earthy sound to . transcend the contemporary limi\u00ad tations of his genre and become an engrossing expression of emo\u00ad tion which pleases the heart as much as the head. With his current hit singls \"Lady,\" D'Angelo invades the crowded field where Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men reign supreme. Whether Rich's and D'Angelo 's debuts will impact their contem\u00ad porary rivals has yet to be seen. The duo did combine talents to pay a well-received tribute to Ste\u00ad vie Wonder at this year's Grammy Awards. They may not steal the thunder quite yet, but at this rate, they are making some noise.
