[Show details](#__NBK551727_dtls__) OVERVIEW Introduction Eugenol, also called clove oil, is an aromatic oil extracted from cloves that is used widely as a flavoring for foods and teas and as an herbal oil used topically to treat toothache and more rarely to be taken orally to treat gastrointestinal and respiratory complaints. Eugenol in therapeutic doses has not been implicated in causing serum enzyme elevations or clinically apparent liver injury, but ingestions of high doses, as with an overdose, can cause severe liver injury. Background Eugenol (ue gen' ol) is the major constituent [70% to 90%] in the aromatic oil extract from cloves (Syzygium aromaticum), a spice widely used as a flavoring for meats, stews, cakes and teas. Eugenol is also found in lower concentrations in cinnamon and other aromatic spices. The clove is native to the Moluccas, a chain of small islands that are now part of Indonesia and were formerly known as the Spice Islands. Cloves are now grown in several tropical regions and the spice sold as intact flower buds or as a ground powder. Eugenol is the most abundant ingredient in clove oil and is thought to be responsible for its aromatic as well as both beneficial and harmful effects. In vitro, eugenol has been shown to have antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant and antineoplastic activity. Clove oils including eugenol have been claimed to have gentle local anesthetic and antiseptic activities and previously were commonly used in dentistry. Eugenol and clove extracts have also been purposed to be beneficial for gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and for cough, phlegm and chest congestion (as an expectorant). However, there are no convincing data to support the efficacy for any of these conditions, and neither eugenol or other clove extracts have been approved for use in any medical condition in the United States. Nevertheless, clove extracts are found in many topical creams, lotions and bath oils and occasionally in toothpaste for its possible effect in alleviating toothache or painful gums and in electronic cigarette refills. Vials of clove oil are available in health food and ethnic grocery stores and on the internet. Clove oil is advertised as having powerful antioxidant benefits and being useful for toothache, cleaning teeth and freshening of the breath. Clove cigarettes consisting of 60% to 70% tobacco and 30% to 40% cloves were imported from Indonesia and became popular in the United States in the early 1980's when they were ultimately linked to a dozen cases of severe lung injury and banned from sale in many states. In addition, eugenol in higher doses has been used as an \"organic\" insecticide in households and gardens. Thus, eugenol used in low doses appears to have few side effects other than local irritation, rare allergic reactions and contact dermatitis, while exposure or ingestion of a large amounts, as in overdose, can result in tissue injury and a syndrome of acute onset of seizures, coma and damage to the liver and kidneys. Hepatotoxicity The low concentrations of eugenol and clove extracts used topically and in herbal products have not been convincingly linked to instances of liver injury, either in the form of serum enzyme elevations or clinically apparent liver injury. In high doses, however, eugenol appears to be a direct cytotoxin and several instances of severe acute liver and kidney injury have been reported after accidental overdose of eugenol containing herbal products, largely in children. Overdoses have been marked by the onset of agitation, decrease in consciousness and coma arising within hours on ingestion (10-30 mL of clove oil). There is typically an accompanying acidosis, respiratory depression and severe hypoglycemia requiring ventilation and intravenous glucose. Liver injury arises 12 to 24 hours after ingestion with marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels and early coagulation abnormalities. Signs of hepatic failure arise rapidly, and jaundice can develop and deepen. The overall clinical presentation is typical of acute hepatic necrosis and similar to that of acetaminophen, iron or copper overdose. The liver injury generally worsens for several days but then rapidly improves and ultimately resolves within 1 to 3 weeks. Renal dysfunction may also occur but rarely requires intervention or dialysis. Long term injury or effects have not been described. Cases described in the literature have been in infants who swallowed clove oil being used by parents. [Likelihood score](/books/n/livertox/glossary/def-item/glossary.likelihood-score/): C[H] (probable cause of clinically apparent liver injury in overdoses). Mechanism of Injury In high concentrations, eugenol has cytotoxic activity both in vitro and in vivo, characteristics [along with its aromatic qualities] that support its use as an insecticide. Thus, liver injury from eugenol is likely direct hepatotoxicity. Outcome and Management The acute liver injury of eugenol overdose presents clinically with acute hepatic necrosis, a pattern similar to that of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. For these reasons, N-acetyl cysteamine has been used to treat patients with eugenol or clove oil overdose. While not proven to be effective for eugenol overdose in humans, it has been shown to be effective in preventing hepatic injury in animal models. Also important in management is careful attention to details of medical management including prevention of hypoglycemia and maintenance of electrolyte balance and respiratory support. If patients present early, use of activated charcoal or emetics may be useful.
