These strong hormones oftentimes may cause side effects. Moreover, the dosage of synthetic hormones are commonly of the same amount, but in actual fact, each patient may need a different amount of hormones. To achieve the best treatment results, Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BIHRT) has been found to be the better solution.
