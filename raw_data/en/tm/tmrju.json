Objectives . To describe oral complementary medicine (CM) use in people with in flammatory arthritis, associations with use, and changes in use over time. Methods. Demographic, clinical, and patient-reported outcome data from 5,630 participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) were extracted from the Australian Rheumatology Association Database (ARAD), a national observational database. CM use atentry into ARAD was ascertained for participants recruited between 2002 and 2018. CM was categorised according to theNIH/Cochrane schema (fatty acids, herbs, or supplements). Logistic regression was used to assess associations between demographic characteristics and CM use. Change in CM use between 2006 and 2016 was investigated using a nonparametric test for trend of rate by year. Results . 2,156 (38.3%) ARAD participants in women (OR1.3; 95% CI: 1.13-1.50), those with tertiary education private health insurance (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.05-1.41) but not strong opioids, and less prevalent in current smokers (OR 0.76; 95%: CI 0.63-0.91). CM use was not associated with pain, disease activity, or qualityof life. The most common CMs were sh oils ( N= 1,489 users) followed by glucosamine ( N= 605 ). Both declined in use over time between 2006 and 2016 (27.5% to 21.4%, trend p=0 :85and 15.5% to 6.4%, trend p<0 :01), respectively. Conclusion . Oral CM use is common among Australians with in flammatory arthritis. Its use is greater among women and those with tertiary education. Fish oil and glucosamine, the most common CMs, both declined in use over time. 1. Introduction Inflammatory arthritis comprises a range of conditions that aect joints and other tissues. These conditions include rheu-matoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).In Australia, the prevalence of RA ranges between 0.46%from a systematic review that included doctor-diagnosedHindawi International Journal of Rheumatology Volume 2020, Article ID 6542965, 9 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6542965 RA only [1] to 1.9% according to the 2017-18 National Health Survey which relies solely upon self-report [2].Up to 0.4% of school children are reported to have JIA[3], and AS and PsA have a reported prevalence of0.25% and 0.19%, respectively [4]. Treatment for in flammatory arthritis depends on the type of disease, its symptoms, and severity. When indicated,conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs(csDMARDs) and biologic/targeted synthetic DMARDs to slow or stop the progres- sion of the disease and limit or prevent joint damage [5].Nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and gluco- corticoids are also sometimes indicated to manage pain andinflammation and may also have disease-modifying e ects for some types of in flammatory arthritis [6, 7]. Complementary medicine (CM) is a broad term that encompasses a range of therapies, usually natural products,and also mind and body practices. Natural products includefatty acids (e.g., sh oil, New Zealand (NZ) green-lipped mussels, and evening primrose oil), herbs (e.g., ginger, celery,and Chinese herbs), vitamins (e.g., vitamin C) and multivita- mins, minerals (e.g., magnesium and zinc), complex com- pounds (e.g., glucosamine and chondroitin), and probiotics,all commonly available as dietary supplements [8]. CM mayor may not be recommended by health professionals andmay be used alone or in combination with conventionalmedicine. Di erent forms of CM are frequently used by patients with chronic diseases including in flammatory arthri- tis [9]. Two separate population-based studies performed in Australia reported that over a third of those with arthritisuse oral CM [9, 10]. A national health survey reported that36.1% of 25,906 adults with self-reported arthritis use oral CM [10], while 38.4% of 3,161 participants in the North West Adelaide Health Study with self-reported doctor-diagnosedarthritis reported CM use [9]. Clinic-based estimates varywidely depending upon the setting. For example, 23% werefound to be using oral CM in a hospital-based early in flam- matory arthritis clinic in Singapore [11], while the rate hasbeen estimated to vary from 35% to 63% in RA clinics inJapan [12] and Australia [13], respectively. In an Americangeneral practice study 26.6% of patients with RA were takingsupplements, 20.8% were taking vitamins and minerals, and10.1% were taking herbs [14]. Studies have also shown that oral CM use is common in AS. In a cross-sectional study of 75 attendees of an AustralianAS clinic, 72.1% were taking a dietary CM at the time of thestudy [15]. The prevalence of use is reportedly lower in JIA;17% of 235 attendees of a Canadian arthritis clinic werereported to be using dietary changes or supplements [16],while 29% of 134 patients in US paediatric rheumatologyclinics report current herbal medicine use [17]. No studieshave looked at the prevalence of dietary CM use in peoplewith PsA. The aim of this study was to describe the use of oral CM among people with RA, PsA, AS, and JIA contributing to the Australian Rheumatology Association Database (ARAD), a large national prospective observational registry. Secondaryaims were to determine any associations with oral CM useand the demographic and clinical characteristics of ARADparticipants and investigate trends in types of oral CM usedover time. 2. Methods 2.1. Australian Rheumatology Association Database (ARAD).ARAD is a voluntary national registry that collects longitudi-nal health outcome data from people with in flammatory arthritis. It includes participants with RA, PsA, AS, and JIA[18]. Most participants enroll when they commence ab/tsDMARD. Enrolment is also encouraged for those not starting b/tsDMARDs but active targeting of this group has only occurred on an ad hoc basis. Based on residentialpostcode, demographic and clinical characteristics partici-pants appear to be nationally representative, with rheuma-tologists from all states and territories having contributedpatients [19]. ARAD has received ethical approval fromcommittees and organisations across Australia. All partici-pants provide written permission to be contacted byARAD investigators and informed consent to participatein the registry as well as have their data linked with othernational databases including state and territory cancer reg- istries, death registry, and the pharmaceutical and medical benets schemes. As described previously [18 -20], at enrolment, details of diagnosis, disease status, and b/tsDMARD prescribed (ifapplicable) are obtained from the treating rheumatologist.All ARAD participants complete detailed entry and 6- to12-monthly follow-up questionnaires (paper-based oronline). Data collected from the participants include demo-graphic and socioeconomic details, disease duration andseverity, self-reported past, and current medical historyincluding malignancies and other chronic conditions, use ofantirheumatic drugs with the date commenced and ceased, other medications including CM, and smoking and alcohol history. Details concerning the level of pain experienced (0to 100 scale where 0 is no pain and 100 is as bad as it couldbe) and overall arthritis activity (0 to 100 scale where 0 isnone and 100 is extreme) in the preceding week are alsoascertained. Arthritis-speci c disability is assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (0 to 3 wherehigher scores indicate greater disability) [21], while qualityof life is measured with the Assessment of Quality of Life(AQoL) (0 to 1 where higher score indicates better qualityof life) [22], European Quality of Life (EuroQoL or EQ-5D(UK)) (0 to 1 where 0 is worst imaginable health state and 1 is the best imaginable health state) [23], and the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form (SF-36) (0 to 100 where ahigher score indicates better health) [24]. In the event of missing or ambiguous data, ARAD sta contact the participant, the rheumatologist, and/or othertreating doctor to verify the data. For the purpose of thisstudy, ARAD participants were eligible if they enrolledbetween 1 September 2001 and 31 May 2018. 2.2. Complementary Medication. Self-reported use of oral CM therapy for arthritis treatment is collected at each ques- tionnaire. Current use of ginger, St John 's wort, celery seed,2 International Journal of Rheumatologypennywort, Chinese herbs, glucosamine, sh oil, homeo- pathic remedies, NZ green-lipped mussels, kelp, and shark n are asked about speci cally. The use of other CMs is obtained from two free text elds. For the purpose of this study, we grouped CMs, as dened by NIH [25] and Cochrane [8], into three categories: fatty acids, herbal medicine, and supplements. Fatty acids areanimal and vegetable oils that contain omega-3 (e.g., sh oil and evening primrose oil); herbal medicines are plant prepa- rations (e.g., ginger and Chinese herbs); and supplements are vitamins, minerals (e.g., magnesium and zinc), and complexcompounds such as amino sugars (e.g., glucosamine andchondroitin). We excluded calcium, iron, and vitamin D sup-plements as they are not speci c for in flammatory arthritis and/or could have been prescribed for other reasons, whilefolic acid use was excluded as this is prescribed withmethotrexate. 2.3. Statistical Analyses. Selected baseline characteristics of the ARAD cohort were assessed by disease type using descriptive statistics, frequency, and chi-squared for categor- ical variables, ANOVA, or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continu-ous variables. Analyses were performed with and withoutJIA to assess if the JIA population in fluenced the results. Baseline was de ned as the entry date into ARAD ( rst ques- tionnaire completed). Baseline responses were compared forCM users and those not taking any CMs. Logistic regressionmodels were used to assess associations between baselinedemographic characteristics and CM use. Multivariablemodelling was performed to ascertain independent predic-tors of CM use. Employment was coded as working, not working, and permanently unable to work due to illness. Not workingincludes home duties, student, retired, and others from a freetexteld that includes casual work, volunteer work, and carers. The Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Men-tal Component Summary (MCS) scores of the SF-36 werecalculated using standard algorithms based on populationnorms for Australia. For socioeconomic status (SES), weassigned an Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) score. We coded SESaccording to the Index of Relative Socio-economic Advan-tage and Disadvantage (IRSAD). The location was based onthe participant 's baseline address and classi ed at Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1). SEIFA 1 is the lowest quintile with rela-tively greater disadvantage and a lack of advantage in general;SEIFA 5 is the highest quintile with a relative lack of disad-vantage and greater advantage in general. Potential explanatory variables included in the model were age, sex, disease duration, HAQ, AQoL, EQ-5D (UK),pain level in the last week, overall arthritis activity in the lastweek, education (tertiary/secondary/did not completed sec-ondary), employment (working, not working/home duties/-student/retired/other, or permanently unable/ill), SES,current private health insurance, current smoking status, alcohol status (never, sometimes, or every day), current b/tsDMARD/prednisolone/methotrexate status, opioid, andNSAID use. retained in the multivariable model if they remained signi cant at p=0 :05. Results are expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% con dence interval (CI). CM use between 2006 and 2016, the period with high numbers at baseline, is represented graphically and statisti-cally using a nonparametric test for trend of rate by year. All analyses were performed using Stata 14. 3. Results There were 5,630 ARAD participants were predominantly Caucasian (94.1%). There weresignicant di erences between the disease populations. Compared with RA participants, other disease groups weresignicantly younger ( p<0 :01for each comparison); a higher proportion of females had RA, JIA, and PsA, but alower proportion had AS; and disease duration was shorteron average for JIA than other diagnoses. In addition, a lowerproportion of RA participants had completed tertiary educa-tion and they were less likely to be in current employmentand have private health insurance in comparison to PsAand AS participants, while almost three-quarters of JIA par-ticipants were still students. RA participants also had higher pain levels and greater disability and poorer health-related quality of life comparedwith the other disease groups, as indicated by higher meanHAQ, lower mean SF-36 (PCS and MCS scores), and AQoL scores. The majority of participants across all diagnosis cate- gories were taking b/tsDMARDs at baseline (55.6% overall),while current methotrexate and prednisolone use was higheramong participants with RA. 3.1. Complementary Medicine Use. Overall, 2156 (38.3%) of the cohort were taking at least one CM at baseline (Table 2). Homeopathic remedies ( n=4 7) were included in the overall analysis, but not grouped by category because theyhad many ingredients across categories. Participants withPsA had the greatest use (44.6%), followed by AS (38.2%),RA (37.9%), and JIA (21.1%). Among those with CM use, 57.4% were taking one, 27.7% were taking two, and 14.9% were taking three or more CMs. Table 2 shows the type of CM in use across all ARAD participants at baseline. The most common category of CMwas fatty acids ( of fatty acids). There were 808 supplements, most commonly glucosamine ( n= 605 , 74.9% of supplements), and 296 most commonly ginger ( n= 148 , 50.0% of herbs). Table 3 presents the results of the univariate and multi- variable analysis investigating di erences between CM users and nonusers. In the univariate analysis, CM use was associ-ated with having PsA, older age, being female, having a ter-tiary education, higher SES, having private healthinsurance, better self-reported function (lower HAQ), and3 International Journal of RheumatologyTable 1: Demographic and clinical details of Australian Rheumatology Association Database (ARAD) participants by disease group at baseline and their complementary medicine use, N= 5,630 (N= 185) Mean (SD) Mean (SD) Mean (SD) Mean (SD) Mean (SD) age (years) 56.8 (13.0) 52.3 (12.3) 45.8 (12.7) 13.4 (6.9) Disease duration (years) 12.7 (10.8) 10.7 (9.3) 12.4 (11.1) 5.8 (6.4) HAQ (0-3)a1.2 (0.8) 0.9 (0.7) 0.7 (0.6) 0.7 (0.7) AQoL (0-1)a0.5 (0.2) 0.6 (0.2) 0.6 (0.2) 0.6 (0.3) EQ-5D (UK) (0-1)a0.6 (0.3) 0.6 (0.3) 0.6 (0.3) 0.7 (0.2) SF-36 PCS (0-100)a31.4 (10.7) 35.1 (11.1) 38.2 (10.9) 41.4 (11.3) SF-36 MCS (0-100)a45.5 (12.0) 46.4 (11.8) 46.0 (11.1) 50.3 (9.6) Pain in last week (0-100)a47.4 (26.4) 45.3 (25.9) 39.5 (27.9) 31.8 (27.9) Arthritis condition in last week (0- 100)a 45.2 (26.2) 45.0 (26.7) 39.9 (26.6) 40.2 (26.2) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) Female 2,911 (73.5) 446 (59.5) 247 (33.6) 128 (69.2) Education Not completed secondary 1,096 (28.9) 158 (21.1) 124 (17.2) 133 (79.6) Secondary 1,277 (33.6) 204 (27.3) 199 (27.6) 21 (12.6) Tertiary 1,424 (37.5) 386 (51.6) 397 (55.1) 13 (7.8) Employment Working 1,415 (37.2) 413 (55.2) 482 (67.1) 24 (14.6) Not working/home (50.1) 267 (35.7) 184 (25.6) 139 (84.8) Permanently unable/ill 485 (12.7) 68 (9.1) 52 (7.2) 1 (0.6) Socioeconomic index SEIFA 1 lowest 580 (15.0) 90 (12.5) 76 (10.7) 25 (13.8) SEIFA 2 726 (18.8) 126 (17.5) 114 (16.0) 24 (13.3) SEIFA 3 788 (20.4) 144 (20.0) 150 (21.1) 42 (23.2) SEIFA 4 891 (23.1) 169 (23.5) 165 (23.2) 38 (21.0) SEIFA 5 highest 877 (22.7) 191 (26.5) 206 (29.0) 52 (28.7) Current private health insurance 2,182 (55.1) 489 (65.3) 443 (60.2) 101 (54.6) Current smoker 544 (13.8) 87 (11.6) 121 (16.4) 4 (2.4) Alcohol use Never 1,455 (36.8) 143 (19.1) 144 (19.6) 137 (82.0) Sometimes 2,040 (51.5) 499 (66.6) 484 (65.8) 30 (18.0) Everyday 464 (11.7) 107 (14.3) 108 (14.7) 0 (0.0) Current opioid use (potency) No 2678 (67.6%) 99 (53.5) Prednisoloneb Current 1,756 (44.3) 179 (23.9) 77 (10.5) 44 (23.8) Past 818 (20.7) 225 (30.0) 214 (29.1) 72 (38.9) Methotrexateb Current 2,463 (62.2) 424 95 (12.9) 123 (66.5)4 International Journal of Rheumatologyworse health-related quality of life (higher AQoL and EQ- 5D) but showed no di erence in SF-36 physical and mental function scores, level of pain or overall arthritis activity inthe last week.

Compared to baseline (38.3%), at the six-monthfollow-up questionnaire, out of 4,077/5630 (72.4%) partici-pants with data, 37.9% were taking at least one CM. Thiswas similar to the 38.2% taking at least one CM at 12 months(data for 3,901/5630 (69.3%) participants) (data not shown). Figure 1 shows CM use over time for the most common CMs recorded at any questionnaire between 2006 and 2016. Fish oil, while still the most common form of CM used in this cohort, declined in use over time from 27.5% in 2006 to21.4% in 2016 although the trend was nonsigni cant (p=0 :85). Glucosamine use also declined over this period (15.5% to 6.4%, trend p<0 :01). Ginger remained stable over time (2.9% to 2.6%, trend p=0 :37), calcium trend p= 0:97) both increased. Krill oil started to be used in 2009, peaked in 2013 (3.0%), and has been decreasing since then(0.8% in 2016).

Discussion CM use is common among people with in flammatory arthritis in Australia as evident by the 38.3% of ARAD participants tak-ing at least one CM at entry into the database. This is consis- tent with the prevalence rates reported in the 2004-05 Australian National Health Survey (NHS) [9] and the NorthWest Adelaide Health Study (NWAHS) cohort in 2004-05[10]. Use among JIA participants was much lower comparedto the other disease groups. Of those taking at least one CM,just under half were taking two or more. The most commonCMs were fatty acids, predominantly sh oil, and supple- ments, most commonly glucosamine. However, the use ofboth of these CMs declined over the decade from 2006 to 2016. Similar to other studies, we found that CM use was asso- ciated with being female and being tertiary educated [26 -28]. Other associations which remained in the multivariable anal-ysis included having private health insurance, not currentlysmoking, consuming alcohol sometimes (rather than never),having poorer function, and current low potency opioid andNSAID use. We did not investigate the association with placeof residence although another Australian study found anassociation with living in rural and remote areas [29]. Our results indicate that the use of particular types of CM fluctuates over time. The two most popular CMs, sh oils, and glucosamine have been declining in use over time, while sup-plements (mainly vitamins) have been increasing over time.An Australian study of oral CM use in the general populationof South Australia at three time points (1993, 2000 and 2004)reported that oral CM use rose from 48.5% to 52.2% between 1993 and 2004 [27]. Reasons for use were for general health (70%) followed by for muscle, bones, or joints (21%), for theimmune system (18.2%), for nerves or stress (13.0%), andfor blood or circulation (9.5%). In an Australian population-matched cross-sectional survey of 2,025 Australian adults in2019 the use of CM was found to be 50.3% [30]. High quality and robust evidence to support the use of various oral CMs for RA, PsA, AS, and JIA is lacking. A2017 systematic review based upon 22 trials foundmoderate-quality evidence for a small favourable e ect (SMD -0.21 (95% CI -0.42 to -0.00) translating to <8% improvement) for marine oil supplements in RA [31]. How-ever, the e ects varied depending upon the type of marine oil, dose, and ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosa-hexaenoic acid (DHA).

A strength of our study is that ARAD collects longitudi- nal data enabling us to determine whether CM use has chan-ged over time. Our study is also the rst to provide a population-based estimate of the prevalence of CM useamong people with PsA as well as add to the limited data available for CM use in AS [15] and JIA [16, 17]. A generally high number of ARAD participants complete questionnaireseach year, 12.7% only complete one questionnaire, 87.3%complete 2 questionnaires, and 78.9% complete 3 question-naires. Loss to follow-up may be a potential source of biasfor our trend analyses although those that lled in 6 and 12-month questionnaires had similar rates of CM use(37.9% and 38.2%, respectively) compared to baseline(38.3%). Another strength was the size of our cohort allowingus to investigate the associations of CM use across a largenumber of participants with diverse demographic, disease,and treatment characteristics. Potential limitations include the fact that participation in ARAD is voluntary and therefore our results may not be gen-eralisable to the Australian population overall or by in flam- matory arthritis type. However, overall CM use in ARADwas similar to use in people with arthritis found in two Aus-tralian population-based studies, which is reassuring andstrengthens the case for validity. Although we speci cally ask ARAD participants to specify CMs taken for arthritis,we cannot be certain that this is the case. We also have no dataconcerning the amount or dose of the CMs used. Our studyonly investigated oral forms of CM and did not consider otherCM categories such as alternative medical systems, energy therapies, manipulative and body-based methods, mind- body interventions, or other natural product-based therapies. 5. Conclusion Based upon the ndings from ARAD, a large national pro- spective registry, oral CM use is common among Australianswith all types of in flammatory arthritis including JIA. Over a third of people with in flammatory arthritis were taking at least one CM at the time they entered ARAD and this was mostcommon in people with PsA. The observation that many patients with rheumatic diseases use CM in Australia as a complement to their prescribed medications is importantinformation for clinicians. Obtaining details of patients 'CM use is important particularly in considering adverse eventsand possible interactions with prescribed medicines. CM usewas greater among women and those who are better educated.Trends in which types of CM are used changes over time. Fishoil and glucosamine were the most commonly used CM butthey both declined in use over the period of study.
