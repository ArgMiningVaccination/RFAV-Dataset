The treatments All the people I met at the retreat were awesome, including the chef, the restaurant manager, and \"When diet is wrong, medicine is of no use. When diet is correct, medicine is of no need.\" - Ayurvedic proverb Ayurveda and yoga have long been companions [in India,](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/india) for good reason. The two disciplines are complementary pieces of the puzzle. At a [yoga retreat](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats), you are aligning the body, mind, emotions, and energies to the point where your natural way of being embodies vibrancy, clarity, health and wellbeing. Ayurveda often will do the following 3 things: In-depth prescriptions for regimens to use in your daily routine. The proper way to use food, eating habits, and herbal remedies to support wellbeing. Categorizing and understanding your specific mental, emotional and physical constitution. Often Ayurvedic treatment will include personalized sessions where an Ayurvedic doctor or Ayurvedic practitioner will assess your body type, constitution as well as current situation and determine the appropriate treatments from there. Every person and situation are unique, so there are no blanket ayurvedic principles that apply to every person. We all have all three doshas, but each one will be expressed differently in different parts of ourselves. We might be more Kapha dominant in our mind, but Vata type in our body. In the end, it's all about balancing each of our doshas with Ayurvedic practice in mind. When they are balanced, good health and our purest expression naturally flows forth, and our daily routine in life has the ease of a swan gliding through water. The [Vata Dosha](https://www.dabur.com/blog/doshas/what-vata-dosha) controls basic bodily functions, such as blood circulation, heartbeat, breathing, blinking, and more. When the Vata Dosha is in balance, we are bursting with creativity and vitality. When it is out of balance, however, we may be overcome with fear and anxiety. The [Pitta Dosha](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vata-dosha-pitta-dosha-kapha-dosha) is responsible for the body's metabolic systems, such as digestion, absorption, and the body's resting temperature. When the Pitta Dosha is in balance, we are most content and running at optimal intelligence levels (basically, we can think most clearly). When it is out of balance, however, we can become engulfed by rage, which may lead to ulcers. The [Kapha Dosha](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-kapha-dosha#:~:text=Kapha%20dosha%20is%20the%20Ayurvedic,in%20the%20mind%20and%20body.) runs the growth in the body. It does this by supplying water to the various parts of the body, effectively moisturizing and lubricating our bodies. When our Kapha Dosha is in balance, we are loving and forgiving with those in our lives. When it is out of balance, we can become a watery mess filled with insecurities and envy. All Ayurvedic treatments should begin with an ayurvedic consultation with a professional. Because everyone has a different dosha (and history and DNA!), every treatment method will be different. That being said, your path to total rejuvenation will include at least a few similar treatment methods based on the principles of Ayurveda. [Panchakarma treatment](https://www.ayurveda.com/introduction-to-panchakarma/) entails a set of five therapies that all support ayurvedic healing. These spa treatments will ayurvedic massage, the liberal use of medicated oils, dosha-specific ayurvedic medicine, and certain detoxification methods. If you are especially excited about this immersive healing process, then consider heading to a Panchakarma Retreat. Our doshas will largely determine the sort of meals that we are designed to eat, according to the [Ayurvedic principles](https://www.webmd.com/balance/ayurvedic-treatments). Some doshas will call for warming foods while others will thrive on raw fruits and vegetables. As a part of a holistic treatment approach, every Ayurvedic plan should at least address which meals are best for you.
