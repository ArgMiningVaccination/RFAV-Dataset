BHA. This substance helps prevent oils from becoming rancid and has been found to cause cancer in animals. In addition, the US Department of Health and Human Services has labeled [BHA](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151902894341988&set=pb.20415156987.-2207520000.1372352857.&type=3&theater) as \"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.\" Blue 1.

Maltodextrin. Although maltodextrin is usually a natural substance made from plant starch (e.g., [corn](https://nsavvy.wpengine.com/Eat/gmo-corn-study-finds-tumors-in-rats), rice, wheat), companies typically treat the starch with heat, acids, or enzymes that then makes it impossible for the body to break it down.

It emphasizes that \"consumers expect the term 'natural' to describe products that contain no artificial or synthetic ingredients,\" which obviously is not the case for the four Crystal Light mixes. In fact, Kraft's use of the word [\"natural\"](https://nsavvy.wpengine.com/eat/natural-claims-are-disappearing-from-food-and-beverages) to describe these Crystal Light products not only deceives the public, it also does not meet the Food and Drug Administration's standard for use of that word. Therefore CSPI has invited Kraft to discuss and respond to these concerns and to resolve them in order to avoid legal action. If the Crystal Light maker chooses to ignore this request, CSPI plans to pursue a lawsuit.
