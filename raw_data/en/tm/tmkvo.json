As the weather warms and an unexplainable desire to clean out your closets and declutter your home begins, remember that closets aren't the only thing that might need some spring cleaning. Re -examining your financial situation and getting rid of no longer needed paperwork during this transitional period from winter to spring just might make your summer more enjoyable and stress free. This spring, decide to take control, reevaluate and then, consider the best way to approach your financial situation. To help in the process why not try some of these simple and easy ways to check off your financial spring cleaning list: Organize your records The first priority is to organize your records. Form two stacks: one to keep and one to shred. Disorganization is usually the reason debt gets out of control in the first place. Consider reducing paperwork from entering your home and opt toreceive bank statements and other account information electronically. Nobody enjoys paying bills, but ignoring the bill won't make it disappear. If you decide to receive this information electronically make sure you write down the due date.

Spring cleaning your financial record clutter can assist you in your ability to locate needed financial documents in a more timely manner. Save important documents and shred the rest Start a folder or envelope for next years' annual tax records (paycheck stubs and receipts for items you plan to claim as a deduction) in one place. Billing statements not required for tax filing purposes can be shredded generally once you reconcile payment with your next statement. However, you may opt to shred once a year. Check your credit score Your credit score dictates whether you qualify for new credit and the interest rate you will be charged. Take advantage of www.annualcreditreport.com . which offers one free credit report from each of the three major reporting agencies annually. Nobody enjoys spring cleaning, but in doing so, every mail delivery may bring less bills and more money for you to save. This way you will be able to enjoy a more debt free life and take control of your individual situation. It may be hard work in the beginning, but it is possible\u2014if you are willing to work to get back on track. Bottom line you will feel good to know that your finances are organized and having a clearer understanding of where you stand will help you to put your finances in control, rather than letting them control you. The small amount of work you do this spring will yield high dividends later when you are enjoying that nice vacation or retiring a few years ahead of schedule.

Chart Sources: Consumer Reports March 2010 Keep These Documents \"Skimming\" is a method, by which thieves steal your credit card infor- mation, and all it requires is a little illicit technology and a lot of criminal intent, which experts say is likely to continue to rise in 2016. Skimmers are small devices that scan and store credit card data from the magnetic stripe. Skimming occurs most frequently at retail outlets that process credit card payments\u2014 particularly bars, convenience stores, restaurants and gas stations. Skimmers once were larger devices set atop machines and recognizable as out of place to the discerning machine -user. Nowadays, they have become more sophisticated, are as small as a thumb drive, and much more difficult to detect. Gas pumps, especially those in remote locations, are attractive targets, as their remoteness gives thieves time and privacy to install skimming devices. The pumps most likely to get a skimmer are those off interstate highways, farthest from the cash register. Once the card is run through the skimmer, the data is recorded, and the thieves can sell the information through a contact or on the internet, at which point counterfeit cards are made. The criminals go on a shopping spree with a cloned copy of the credit or debit card and cardholders are unaware of the fraud until a state- ment arrives with purchases they did not make. In our October 2015 edition of Spotlight on Finance, an article was included that discussed EMV -meaning Euro pay, MasterCard and Visa. This is an emerging standard for credit cards equipped with computer chips and other technology features that will be utilized to authenticate chip -card - transactions. Until fueling pumps are outfitted with EMV technology, they will read credit card magnetic stripes which lack layers of protection. If thieves know how to compromise that, that's where they will go. Most ATMS and fueling stations have until October, 2017 to update pumps with EMV technology which accommodates credit cards with electronic chips. A Few Tips to Consider: Given the near -invisibility of the devices, it might not be possible to totally avoid a skimming scam, however, consumers can take several steps to protect their cards at the fueling station such as: Pay inside, with cash or credit card, rather than at the pump Be suspicious if the gas pump has a broken security seal, or the word \"void\" appears on it Choose pumps closest to the physical building, not the ones hidden around the building Use a credit card, not debit card, when paying. If a credit card number is skimmed, you have less risk since it's protected by the card's zero-liability policy. If a debit card gets compromised, and they have your PIN, the thief gains access to your account. A recent story in The Tennessean , from Nashville, confirmed this type of activity is occurring in the state: http://www.tennessean.com/story/ information involving \"Skimming\", please visit http://www.creditcards.com .
