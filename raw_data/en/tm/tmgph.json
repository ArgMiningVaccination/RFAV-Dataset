University of Jamestown is committed to ensuring an environment free from all discrimination and/or harassment based on race, color, national origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation, or other status with respect to which discrimination would be unlawful. Prohibited behaviors include disrespectful and offensive behavior, unwelcome remarks and/or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual's race, color, national origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation, or other status with respect to which discrimination would be unlawful. All students, faculty, administrators, and staff are encouraged to work together to prevent acts of unlawful discrimination and/or harassment of any kind. University staff who observe acts of discrimination and/or harassment should intervene to stop discrimination and/or harassment, unless circumstances would make such intervention dangerous. Any student, faculty, administrator, or staff who believes he or she has been subjected to or witnessed discrimination, harassment, or a hostile environment shall promptly report such conduct to the Affirmative Action Officer in Human Resources (Liechty Center/Taber Hall 216) or the alternate designee, the Dean of Students (Nafus Center), so that the University can timely, fairly, and appropriately investigate, document, and respond to any such reports.

Guidelines for Student Requests for Reasonable Accommodation on the Basis of a Learning Disability 1.

Even when parents are involved in requesting services, it is primarily the student's responsibility to initiate the request. 2. A newly accepted or currently enrolled student whose learning disability requires reasonable accommodation may make a request for accommodation at any time. Because the arrangements for some accommodations take a significant amount of time, the student should make a request as early as possible.Nondiscrimination Policy7University of Jamestown, founded in 1883, is a non-sectarian, independent four-year college known for integrating the liberal arts and the professions in a Christian environment.Nondiscrimination Policy 3. To be considered as a student with a learning disability under the law, the individual is responsible for providing relevant written documentation that substantiates his or her claim.

Homesteading began in 1868, and Texas cowmen moved longhorn cattle to great open-range spreads in that portion of the territory known as \"Little Missouri Country.\" By 1872 the Northern Pacific Railway had reached Jamestown. In the part of the territory that is now western North Dakota, a French nobleman, the Marquis de Mores, ranched and built a meat packing plant; another Frenchman, Pierre Wibaux, started a ranching operation that was to become the largest in the United States; and a young man from New York, Theodore \"Old Four Eyes\" Roosevelt, began a career that was to take him to the White House. Amid this excitement and growth, dedicated Presbyterian settlers met to discuss the founding of a college. The first liberal arts college in the area, University of Jamestown was incorporated in 1883 and chartered in 1884 under sponsorship of the Presbyterian Church, which recognized its responsibility to \"promote the progress of our divine religion and to maintain and improve Christian citizenship, believing that these objects cannot be attained without the proper education of our youth under Christian influences.\" The first classes at University of Jamestown began in September of 1886, three years before North Dakota became a state. By the end of the University's second year, eighty-two students were pursuing degrees under the tutelage of five professors. Physical facilities were meager and circumstances difficult on the open prairie. The college hill had only one building and a barn for horses. Wood stoves furnished heat and oil lamps provided light. The extremely cold winter of 1886 contributed to the onset of economic problems. After closing during the financial panic of 1893, the University was reopened in 1909 by the North Dakota Synod under the leadership of President Barend H. Kroeze. Dr. Kroeze was to set in motion forces that would allow the University to grow and prosper as it \"encouraged the development of an educated Christian citizenship\" and sought \"to offer a liberal culture combined with moral training.\" The current 110 acres of wooded land the campus now occupies bears little resemblance to the bleak site upon which the founders stood and pondered the future of their own lives and that of a fledgling college. Today, University of Jamestown overlooks a progressive city of sixteen thousand people which offers a variety of recreational facilities and warm hospitality. Modern facilities now grace \"College Hill,\" including the architectural prize-winning Raugust Library, which houses more than 150,000 items; Larson Lifetime Sports Center; Seibold and Prentice residence halls; Lyngstad Center, a modern classroom facility; the Reiland Fine Arts Center, with its exceptional concert/performance hall; the state-of-the-art Unruh and Sheldon Center for Business and Computer Science; the Ed and Elaine Nafus Student Center; the Foss Fitness Center; the remodeled Liechty Hall; and the new 21,350 square foot McKenna Thielsch Center. The College has also recently completed a 13,350 square foot building in Fargo to house the Doctor of Physical Therapy Program. Only the University's objectives have remained unchanged. These are reaffirmed in our goal of academic excellence in a Christian environment and in our determination to equip our students to face new problems and challenges in a changing world. Those General Information10objectives are realized not only through a quality faculty and curriculum but also through outstanding facilities and co-curricular programs, such as athletics, choir, and drama. We believe a Christian environment is crucial to the educational process. It provides discipline to the development and freedom of the mind and imparts a spiritual dimension of hope and grace. University of Jamestown and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) have an historical relationship, and they maintain their relationship by a covenant agreement to support one another in their respective missions. Our size and location in a small North Dakota community facilitates our mission to provide students with meaningful individual guidance and support by competent and concerned faculty. That is the essence of the quality liberal arts education. The Mission of the University Throughout its more than one hundred- year history, University of Jamestown has consistently stood for academic excellence and Christian principles in all that it does. Catalogs published by the University from the very earliest years declare the commitment of this institution to the highest and best. The mission statement and current values of the University are included below: Mission Statement We are a community dedicated to the development of wholeness in our students. We adhere to a curriculum of academic excellence which balances the ideals of the liberal arts tradition and sound professional preparation. Our Christian tradition encourages an atmosphere of self-discipline, responsibility, and concern for the continuing growth of the individual.Foundational Values As an institution of higher education in the Presbyterian tradition, we celebrate God through the use of our minds and the exercise of reason, believing that God is the source of all truth. \"You shall love the Lord our God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind\" (Matthew 22:37). Our Christian and Reformed tradition embraces the liberal arts and the ongoing search for knowledge and truth as a way of liberating the human spirit and of understanding the world we share with others. University of Jamestown promotes education as a means to improve lives, search for vocation, and create lifelong seekers of truth and wisdom. We value the life of the mind and the life of the spirit and therefore hold that faith and reason reinforce each other and that through mind, heart, and hands one can honor God and serve humanity. Historically, this strong belief that learning and the search for truth are closely connected to faith formed the basis for the Presbyterian Church's early and significant commitment to higher education. As a result, prior to the Civil War, one-fourth of the colleges in the United States were Presbyterian. In 1883, when the Presbyterian Church extended its mission into the Dakota Territory's frontier, University of Jamestown was founded in a newly incorporated city ninety miles west of Fargo. University of Jamestown is a fully independent, self-governing institution that shares an historic relationship with the Presbyterian Church (USA). We are proudly non-sectarian and welcome students of all faiths and beliefs. Our Latin motto, \"Lux et Veritas,\" proclaims to all that the pursuit of truth lights our journey today as it has since 1883.General Information11General Information Accreditation, Approvals, Memberships, and Affiliations University of Jamestown is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission.

Student Work Programs Federal Work Study Federal Work Study is a need based work program that offers part-time employment to students and is subsidized by the federal government. Work awards may be limited by funds available as well as by individual student need in combination with other financial aid awarded. University of Jamestown Work Program A limited number of part-time positions are available to students who do not qualify for the Federal Work Study program.20Loan Programs Loans allow students and parents to borrow money to meet educational costs at relatively low interest rates. In most cases, repayment is delayed until graduation or an enrollment status of less than six credits. Additional information regarding all loans below is available in the Financial Aid Office and on the college website. Federal Direct Loans Federal Direct Loans are available to all students who have completed the FAFSA and are otherwise eligible. Direct Loans are characterized as subsidized or unsubsidized based on the FAFSA in combination with other financial aid awarded to the student. The federal government pays the interest on a Subsidized Direct Loan during the student's enrollment whereas the student is responsible for paying interest on an Unsubsidized Direct Loan. At the borrower's choice, the interest on an Unsubsidized Direct Loan can either be paid during enrollment or can be capitalized. A borrower must complete Direct Loan Entrance Counseling prior to the disbursement of any loan proceeds. The maximum annual loan amounts for dependent students are: Freshmen $5,500 (maximum of $3,500 subsidized) Sophomore $6,500 (maximum of $4,500 subsidized) Junior and Senior $7,500 (maximum of $5,500 subsidized) Repayment begins six months after the borrower is no longer enrolled at least half time. The annual fixed interest rate is 5.045% for undergraduates in the 2018-2019 award year.Federal Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) Parents of dependent students may borrow funds through the PLUS program. Eligibility requirements include U.S. citizenship and an approved credit rating. Repayment generally begins sixty days after the second disbursement, but may be deferred upon request. Alternative Loans The University of Jamestown will certify any alternative education loan that a student requests (up to the student's cost of attendance). Satisfactory Academic Progress Satisfactory Academic Progress is language set forth in federal guidelines. It specifies the minimum academic progress required for a student to continue to participate in federal and state financial aid programs. The University of Jamestown has adopted similar guidelines for institutionally funded programs. Student progress is monitored by the Financial Aid Office at the University of Jamestown after every semester, including summer school. To demonstrate Satisfactory Academic Progress for financial aid purposes, all students must comply with the following three components: 1. Qualitative: First time students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 1.8 until the end of the second academic year, at which time, they must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. Students transferring into or returning to the University of Jamestown after a period of non-attendance will be required Admission, Costs, and Financial Aid21to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 without regard to number of semesters attended elsewhere. 2. Pace or Quantitative: All grade levels must complete (with a 'D-' or higher) at least 67% of all attempted credits. This ensures that the student will complete the program of study within the maximum timeframe. 3. Maximum Timeframe or 150% Rule: The maximum timeframe for an undergraduate program is measured in credit hours and is a period that is no longer than 150 percent of the published length of the educational program. The usual number of credits required for graduation is 124 credit hours at the University of Jamestown. However, some programs may require extra semesters to complete the degree so will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Financial Aid Officer and/or designated committee. Monitoring Procedure The first semester that a student fails to comply with satisfactory academic progress guidelines by either qualitative or pace calculation, a status of FINANCIAL AID WARNING is assigned. No appeal is required by the student. The otherwise eligible student will be entitled to financial aid for one additional semester. The student will be notified by letter and by email of such action. Should a student fail to make progress after a semester on FINANCIAL AID WARNING but (1) has successfully appealed and (2) has been notified that aid has been reinstated, will be assigned the status of FINANCIAL AID PROBATION and an ACADEMIC PLAN is created for the student. ACADEMIC PLANS will be created by the Financial Aid Office, in consultation with the Registrar, using a standard format and formula to determine how many semesters it would reasonably take any student to regain compliance both qualitatively and quantitatively. The student's advisor will be notified of the plan. If the student's APPEAL is denied after any semester or if a student chooses not to appeal, the student is no longer eligible to receive financial aid until such time as compliance has been regained. Any charges that the student incurs during this period of SUSPENSION are the personal responsibility of the student. Admission, Costs, and Financial Aid22Additional Information A detailed Satisfactory Academic Progress policy is available on the University website or in the Financial Aid Office. Only official forms will be accepted for appeals. All forms may be found on the University website. Attempted credits include all courses taken for which a student receives a grade or 'W'. Attempted credits also include those taken during terms in which the student receives no aid as well as repeated courses and credits transferred into the University of Jamestown from other institutions. Repeated courses will be counted only once for the total number of credits completed. However, both sets of credits will be counted toward the 150% Rule. The highest grade will be used to determine GPA. Incompletes must be finished in a timely manner as determined by the Registrar. Action with regard to Satisfactory Academic Progress will be held until the prescribed period has elapsed.Admission, Costs, and Financial Aid Return of Federal Title IV Aid and Institutional Refund/Repayment Policy The University of Jamestown has adopted a policy for institutional refund/repayment that complies with the federal Return of Title IV Funds regulations. A student is considered enrolled for attendance purposes until he/she has officially withdrawn from the University of Jamestown (see Official Withdrawal page 39) or until the end of the semester, whichever is first. The minimum amounts to be returned to Title IV programs are calculated according to federal guidelines. Detailed information is provided to each student every year and is available on request in the Financial Aid Office as well as on the University website. Consortium Agreement The United States Department of Education requires that a written consortium agreement exists between two federally eligible institutions whereby a student desires to take courses at the student's non-degree granting institution. When a consortium agreement is necessary, the financial aid administrators of the two institutions will sign an appropriate agreement. All transcripts for courses taken on a consortium agreement will be transferred to the University of Jamestown at face value.23Student Activities University of Jamestown strives to offer a wide variety of opportunities for students to become engaged during this time in college. Events include dances, athletic events, convocations, concerts, clubs, and more. Among the major social events are New Student Orientation, Homecoming, Family Weekend, and Jimmie Jive Week.

Student Representatives on Committees Student representatives on faculty committees participate actively in the selected functions of those committees. Students are invited to serve on a number of faculty and administrative committees. Convocations A convocation series gives students the opportunity to attend performances, lectures, and other programs of special interest. University Chaplain Throughout its history, The University of Jamestown has provided for the spiritual as well as the academic growth of its students. A chaplain works with others in providing for spiritual needs on campus. The chaplain, student chaplains, and the Religious Life Committee plan activities that work toward the goal of helping students grow in their relationship with Jesus Christ. Activities are planned by the chaplain and the Religious Life Committee to meet these five primary needs of the Christian community: worship, fellowship, nurture, service, and missions. Regular activities include a weekly chapel service, student ministry teams, student bible studies, retreats, service projects, and mission trips.

Residence Hall Contract All students residing in the residence halls are required to sign a yearly contract. There is a $100 penalty for returning students who cancel their room contract prior to June 1. Cancellations by returning students after June 1 result in a $200 penalty. Cancellation of the housing contract after Aug. 1 will result in a $300 cancellation fee. Students looking to move off campus should review the Campus Residence Requirement Exemption Application on the Residents Life section of our website. Residence Hall Regulations All new students receive a copy of the Student Handbook each fall. The Student Handbook is also available in the Office of Student Life or on the University web site. All residence hall regulations are based on an attempt to balance the concern for the individual with the concern for the community. Each residence hall is staffed by a resident director and/or assistant resident director who oversee general residence hall living and who work closely with the resident assistants to develop optimum living conditions for all residents. Transcripts Transcript requests must be submitted in writing at least one week prior to the date needed. Either a completed transcript request form or a letter bearing the student's signature is acceptable. Federal law does not permit the University to honor requests for transcripts made by telephone or by relatives or friends of the student. A request for a transcript of credits by a student who is in debt to the University will not be honored until the debt has been paid. The first transcript issued is free of charge. Thereafter, a fee of $5 per transcript is charged. The written request by the student, accompanied by a check or money order payable to the University of Jamestown, if applicable, should be sent to the Registrar's Office, University of Jamestown, 6086 College Lane, Jamestown, ND 58405. Transcripts can be requested online through the National Student Clearinghouse for an additional $2.25 per transcript. Each transcript includes the student's entire academic record to date.

Academic Advising The academic advising program allows students to explore and develop educational plans appropriate to their life goals and aspirations. All incoming freshmen are registered in UJ Foundations. The course is designed to familiarize first-year students with University of Jamestown and college life in general. The course places particular emphasis on assisting students to \"look inward\" and to evaluate their strengths in order to help them form clear educational goals and a sense of vocation. After the fall semester of the freshman year, students may declare a major and are then reassigned to a faculty advisor in their major area of interest. This is another opportunity for students to receive personal guidance as they progress in their educational plans. Advisors are available to assist in the planning of class schedules and the selection of concentrations within a department. This also enables students to develop an ongoing relationship with faculty members. Student Success Center The Student Success Center offers assistance to students who have not yet declared a major or who need further help in the development of suitable educational plans, the selection of appropriate classes, or the evaluation of academic progress. The Student Success Center strives to promote student development by helping students to identify and assess alternatives and consequences of their educational plans and decisions. This center also provides students with the unique opportunity to receive peer tutoring free of charge. Peer tutors are available to assist students in most subject areas. Students experiencing academic difficulty may consult with the director of the center to develop a plan to help them achieve their academic goals. Consultation on advising concerns and assistance in reading skills, study skills, and time management are also available. The Student Success Center also provides accommodations for students with documented disabilities. The SSC also offers study groups for a variety of subject areas. Students can find a complete listing of study groups on the SSC website. Students are encouraged to attend a study group first, if the subject area is offered.

Student Conduct Admission to the University of Jamestown constitutes agreement that applicants will abide by the rules and regulations of the University. Policies and programs are directed toward assisting students to develop a maturity that allows them to work and think as free individuals within a community. Specific University regulations may be found in the Student Handbook, which is distributed to each new student in the fall. Additional copies are available from the Student Affairs office or on the University's web site.Student Activities, Services, and Conduct28Smoking and Tobacco Use University of Jamestown strives to provide an atmosphere conducive to the physical and mental well-being of its employees, students and visitors. To support this atmosphere, the University of Jamestown is a Tobacco Free Campus. This policy applies to all employees, students, visitors, and contractors. The policy also applies to external individuals or companies renting space with the University of Jamestown and should be reflected in all agreements/contracts with such individuals or companies. The use of electronic (e-cigarettes) is also prohibited including all types of vaping devices. Alcohol The use of alcohol on campus or at student University functions is prohibited. Under North Dakota law, alcoholic beverages are prohibited to anyone under twenty-one years of age. Procuring alcoholic beverages for a minor is a felony offense. The University and the Law The University upholds municipal, state, and federal laws and cooperates fully with all law enforcement agencies. Violation of public law may result in University disciplinary action. As a part of the larger community, students accept full responsibility for their own actions under federal, state, and local laws. While affording reasonable aid to its members in difficulties with the law, the University provides no immunity from the consequence of illegal acts. Academic Integrity Policy At the University of Jamestown, we operate in an atmosphere of mutual trust between and among instructors and students. Sometimes this trust is violated through the intentional or accidental misrepresentation of facts, ideas, or data by members of the academic community. Such misrepresentations are violations of the Academic Integrity Policy. There are three main types of violations: cheating, inappropriate collaboration, and plagiarism. Cheating involves the misrepresentation of knowledge or experience. For example, if students use unauthorized materials during an examination (for instance, by using crib sheets, looking at other students' exams, obtaining the questions in advance, and so on) they are falsely representing themselves as having recalled material or reasoned correctly, when, in fact, they did not. If students fake the data in a laboratory experiment, they are falsely suggesting that they acquired information in accordance with prescribed procedures. Inappropriate collaboration involves presenting academic work as one's independent effort when it includes significant elements of the work of others. When important ideas or actual phrasings in an academic work belong to an unnamed colleague, misrepresentation has occurred. It is dishonest for one student to write some or all of another student's paper or presentation. It is equally wrong for one student to develop key ideas for a project that is represented as the work of another. Inappropriate collaboration is a violation for which both or all parties will be held accountable. Plagiarism involves both theft and cheating. When someone appropriates, for use in formal course work, the wording, phrasing, or ideas of another, and either accidentally or intentionally fails to acknowledge the debt, it is considered theft. Plagiarism is also cheating in that one is Student Activities, Services, and Conduct29creating a false impression about one's own intelligence, ability, and achievement. If students are unsure about what constitutes plagiarism, they should seek help from their instructors and refer to appropriate handbooks. Disciplinary Process It is the responsibility of every member of the University of Jamestown community to maintain the integrity of the grading system; anyone with knowledge of violations of the Academic Integrity Policy must report this information to a faculty member, a member of the university staff or administration, or the Provost. All cases of academic dishonesty must be reported to the Provost, who will maintain records on each student who has committed a violation of the policy. Students who violate the Academic Integrity Policy of the University of Jamestown will be subject to disciplinary action. A course instructor who suspects a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy should inform the student of his/her suspicion and present him/her with the evidence, allowing the student an opportunity for rebuttal. Upon determination of a violation, the course instructor will decide the penalty to be imposed. Depending on the severity of the infraction, this may involve a requirement to complete the assignment again, failing the student for the assignment, or failing the student for the course. If a dispute arises between a course instructor and a student about whether a violation has been committed, it is to be referred to the Provost for resolution no later than three weeks from the end of the Student Activities, Services, and Conduct semester in which the dispute occurred. If the Provost determines that no question exists, the appeal process is terminated. If any question remains, the Provost may refer it to the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate for a hearing. The decision of the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate about the commission of an offense will be final in all such cases. If a student involved in a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy is not enrolled in a particular instructor's course, as in a case of inappropriate collaboration, the instructor should inform the Provost of the case for appropriate disciplinary action. In the case of multiple violations of the Academic Integrity Policy by a student, the Provost may impose additional sanctions, which may include academic warning, academic probation, academic suspension, or expulsion. If any question remains, the Provost may refer it to the Executive Committee of the faculty for a hearing. The decision of the Executive Committee of the faculty will be final in all such cases.30Classroom and Residential Buildings The University of Jamestown campus offers a unique architectural blend of both old and new.

Class standing: Students taking directed or independent studies must have completed at least twenty-four college semester credits. 4. A student who has received a D or F in a course may not take a directed or independent study in order to replace the grade for that course. International Study For many years, University of Jamestown students have pursued academic programs at approved foreign universities during the summer terms, semesters, or during entire years. The courses are selected by the student with the University's approval and resulting credits are accepted toward a degree and major requirements. The University of Jamestown is a member of the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP), one of the largest student exchange organizations in the world. Students attending an ISEP member institution have access to more than 150 study sites in Africa, Asia, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Middle East, Oceania, South Pacific, and the United Kingdom for a full academic year, a semester, or a summer program. The ISEP program provides the opportunity to become immersed in a foreign culture, earn credit towards a degree at the University of Jamestown, make friends in a host country, and meet students from all over the world. Students involved in the ISEP exchange program pay the same tuition, room and board costs that they would pay at the University of Jamestown. Federal and most other forms of financial aid can be applied toward participation in ISEP. The Irish American Scholars Program, open to all majors, provides semester and full academic year options for study in Northern Ireland. See www.presbyteriancolleges.org/irishamericanscholars.htm for more details. Contact the Career Center in Raugust Library and see www.isep.org for more information on the ISEP program. Experiential Education Experiential Education includes field experience such as internships and cooperative education, job shadows, volunteer work, consulting projects, and practicums. Experiential Education is campus- wide in scope and available to all students regardless of major. Interns are placed with a site supervisor willing to provide training and supervision. Interns receive valuable on-the-job training while earning college credit, and in some cases are also paid. Work assignments must be relevant to the student's major program of study and relate to the student's educational and professional goals. Students may participate in the program in the fall or Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations36spring semesters or during the summer months which would enable them to work full-time at the site. Students have access to on-campus, local, regional, national, and international contacts for internship opportunities through resources in Career Services and the Experiential Education Office, and on the Career Center web site: www.uj.edu/career-center. Internships and other experiential education opportunities may not be available in all states and/or countries. Please see the Career Center Director for more information. The Career Alumni Network, alumni and friends of UJ, provides contacts for job shadows and information regarding careers. F-1 International students seeking curricular and optional practical training should consult the Director of International Admission. For more Career information, contact the Career Center Director located in Raugust Library. Honors The Dean's List of Outstanding Scholars The dean's list of outstanding scholars includes all full-time students who at the end of any given semester earn a grade point average of 3.50 or better with a minimum of twelve semester credits, exclusive of \"Pass\" credits. College Fellows A limited number of outstanding junior and senior students are selected each year by the faculty for the distinction of College Fellow. Recipients are to be of exemplary character and must possess an overall cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or better as well as a grade point average of 3.50 or better in their majors. Fellows may tutor or teach under the direction of their department chair(s) and hold rank just below that of college instructor.Distinction in Degrees Scholastic excellence is recognized with diploma designations as follows: Latin Honor Minimum GPA Summa Cum 3.50 The honors-level grade point average must be maintained on both the University of Jamestown credits attempted and the cumulative grade point average, including all transfer credits. Honor Societies Students who qualify may join honor societies that have chapters at the University of Jamestown. Current honor societies are Alpha Chi (academic), Alpha Mu Gamma (foreign language), Beta, Beta, Beta (Biology), Lambda Pi Eta (communication), Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi Lambda Theta (education), Psi Chi (psychology), and Sigma Theta Tau (nursing). Academic Regulations Academic CreditA unit of credit (one credit hour) is defined as the equivalent of one 50-minute class period per week for one semester with a minimum of two hours of additional work outside of class meeting time for each hour in class, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time. For internships, practicums and student teaching, credits awarded based on average hours per week with 40 hours per 1 credit including 2 or more hours of additional coursework. Measurement for Laboratory courses is equivalent of one credit for each 3 hour lab. For lessons, a credit is earned for each \u00bd hour of lesson time. Attendance The participation of students in all regularly scheduled classes is considered an Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations37important part of the academic procedure. It is assumed that students will conscientiously fulfill this responsibility when classes are scheduled and will contribute to class activities. An instructor may consider irregular attendance in his/her evaluation of students' educational achievement. Students are responsible for ascertaining attendance requirements for each course in which they are enrolled. Specific policies related to excused and unexcused absences can be found in the Student Handbook. Additional copies of this may be obtained by contacting the director of student housing. Grades Tentative grades are reported at midterm to assist students in gauging their effort for the remainder of the term. At the completion of each course the student is given a grade: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, or P for passing work; I for incomplete work; and F for failure. The grade \"incomplete\" is given only at the end of a semester in which the student, for justifiable reasons in the opinion of the professor, is unable to complete the course. If an incomplete course is not completed within four weeks of the next resident semester after the grade was given, or if an incomplete course is not completed within one semester by a student not in residence, the grade will be that which the professor submitted based on the assumption that the student received failing grades or zero points for all uncompleted work. Exceptions to this rule will be made only when there exist reasons clearly beyond the control of the student, and the student, with the professor's approval, has petitioned the office of Provost for an extension of time. The Provost may grant an extension of time or a replacement of the incomplete with a W (Withdrawn).Pass-Fail Option Twelve elective credits may be taken on a pass-fail basis. Courses taken on a pass-fail basis cannot be courses that contribute to major, minor, or general education requirements. No more than one class may be taken on this basis during any given term. No more than twelve semester credits of pass-fail work may be counted toward the satisfaction of graduation requirements (student teaching and internships are the exception). Students taking a course on a pass-fail basis must attend all classes, take all examinations and possess all prerequisites required of students enrolling on a letter grade basis. Performance of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- caliber will be awarded a grade of \"Pass,\" which does not affect the grade point average. Grades of F are included in the computation of the grade point average. Students may elect (or reverse) the pass- fail option until two weeks after mid-term for semester-long courses, and until the fifth week of an eight-week course. Grading of Experiential Education and Internships: All experiential education and internship credits will be graded Pass/Fail. If participation is not a requirement for a major or minor, it will contribute to the twelve-credit maximum for Pass/Fail. If participation is a requirement of a major or minor, it will be exempt from the twelve-credit limit (for example, student teaching.) Appealing Grades and Other Academic Matters Not Pertaining to Academic Integrity IssuesA student may appeal the grade she or he received in a course. Grounds for an appeal are limited to capriciousness, errors of fact, or evidence of bias on the part of the instructor, and it is the responsibility of the student to provide evidence that an appeal is warranted. The belief that an instructor graded in too difficult a manner, assigned too much work for a given course, and the like, are not grounds Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations38for a grade appeal. Grades on individual assignments, tests, or other measures of student learning are not appealable except to the extent that they affect the final grade a student received in a course. Students wishing to appeal grades or other academic matters not related to academic integrity issues should follow this timeline and process:1. Discuss the concern with the faculty member involved no later than two weeks into the beginning of the subsequent semester of the issuance of the final grade to initiate an appeal (into the fall semester for spring semester and summer term courses and into the spring semester for fall semester courses). If the student remains unsatisfied or if the instructor is separated from the University, the student should: 2. Appeal to the department chairperson in writing within five working days of discussing the grievance with the faculty member. Include the circumstances of the grievance, specific concerns, and a possible remedy. The student should make an appointment and meet with the chairperson. It is the responsibility of the department chair to collect evidence from the student and the faculty member, if the faculty member is not separated from the university, prior to making a decision. The student will be notified in writing of the chairpersons' decision within five working days of the meeting. If the student remains unsatisfied or if the faculty member who issued the grade is the department chairperson, the student should: 3. Appeal to the Provost in writing within five working days of notification by the chairperson's decision. Include in the written document circumstances of the grievance, specific concerns, and a possible remedy. The student should make an appointment and meet with the Provost. It is the responsibility of the Provost to collect evidence from the student, faculty member, if the faculty member is not separated from the university, and the department chair prior to making a decision. The student will be notified in writing of the Provost' decision. In all cases, the decision of the Provost is final. In cases where no evidence of capriciousness, errors in fact, or bias exist, the original grade will remain. In cases where evidence of capriciousness, errors in fact, or bias does exist, either the department chairperson or the Provost will administratively change the grade to a more appropriate grade and notify the instructor of the grade change within five business days of the notification. Auditing Students must register for all classes they wish to audit. No credit is given for a class that is audited. Students must observe normal attendance requirements; however, they are not required to take tests or submit term papers. Students have until two weeks after mid-term for semester-long classes and until the fifth week for an eight-week course to elect to take the course for audit. Adding or Dropping Classes Students may drop and/or add classes within the first ten days of the semester without receiving a grade, charge, or a \"W\" on their transcript. The class schedule that is in place after the ten-day drop/add period will be the class schedule charged out by the Business Office. No tuition refunds, other than government-mandated ones, will be paid after that date. Classes that run only eight weeks have a five day rather than a ten day drop/add deadline. A $5 fee is charged for a change made after these deadlines. Classes added Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations39beyond these deadlines require approval of the Provost. Students may withdraw from classes without receiving a grade until two weeks after mid-term or until the end of the fifth week for classes that run eight weeks; however, there will be a $5 fee and a \"W\" will appear on the transcript. After this period a student may not withdraw from a course unless there exist reasons clearly beyond the control of the student, and the student has petitioned the office of the Provost for approval to withdraw. Students who do not withdraw by the deadline will receive a grade for the course in accordance with their performance in the course. Students who stop attending a class without officially dropping will receive a failing (F) grade. Grade Point Average (GPA) The University of Jamestown grade point average (GPA) is used to determine academic standing. The GPA is computed by dividing total grade points earned by the total number of semester credits attempted in which the student received a grade of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, or F. (Exception: If a course is repeated, only the higher grade is included in the GPA calculation; however, the lower grade remains on the transcript as well.) Grade points awarded per semester credit are the following: A+ = 4, A = 4, A- = 3.67, B+ = 3.33, B = 3, B- = 2.67, C+ = 2.33, C = 2, C- = 1.67, D+ = 1.33, D = 1, D- = .67, and F = 0.Grades of P, W, and I (Incomplete) do not affect the grade point average. Two grade point averages are maintained for each transfer student - the University of Jamestown GPA and an overall GPA that includes transfer credit. A minimum overall GPA of 2.00 must be maintained for graduation. The overall GPA is also used in determining eligibility for scholarships and for all academic honors (other criteria beyond GPA may exist in some cases.) Classification of Students Official classification of students is determined by the registrar as follows: Freshman: fewer than thirty-two semester creditsSophomore: a minimum of thirty-two semester credits and a maximum of sixty-three semester creditsJunior: a minimum of sixty-four semester credits and a maximum of ninety-five semester creditsSenior: a minimum of ninety-six semester credits Academic Course Load Undergraduate students registered for twelve or more semester credits during a given semester are classified as full-time students. Students expecting to complete their degree program in four years must successfully complete an average of thirty-two semester credits per year. Students granted permission by the Provost to carry an overload in excess of twenty semester credits will be assessed a fee. Official Withdrawal from College A student who must withdraw from college should obtain an \"Official Withdrawal\" form from the Student Success Coordinator. This form must be completed for official withdrawal from the University. An unofficial withdrawal results in failure in all courses. Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations40Adequate Progress Toward a Degree The GPA levels defined as \"adequate progress toward a degree\" are as follows: Minimum Credits GPA First three semesters of undergraduate education ............................................ 1.80 All others ................................................... 2.00 Academic Warning A student is placed on academic warning when his/her semester GPA drops below the level defined above as \"adequate progress.\" The student will be removed from academic warning status whenever his/her semester and cumulative GPA return to the level required for adequate progress. Academic warning notifies a student that he/she has a GPA that might impede his/her ability to meet graduation requirements. Academic warning status does not restrict course load, eligibility for intercollegiate athletics, or the right to hold student office. It does specifically render the student ineligible for directed/independent studies. Academic Probation A student is placed on academic probation when the student has been on academic warning status for one semester and has failed in the following semester to raise his/her semester GPA to the level required for adequate progress. The University, however, reserves the right to place a student on probation without a previous semester on warning. the student has been on academic warning status for one semester and has failed in the following semester to raise his/her semester GPA to the level required for adequate progress. A student will be removed from academic probation when his/her semester GPA return to the level required for adequate progress. Academic scholarships are reduced by ten percent during the semester in which a student is placed on probation. The reduction is not cumulative and the original scholarship is reinstated when the student returns to good academic standing per the Provost. While on probation, the student is ineligible for intercollegiate athletics, and the course load is restricted \u2014 unless otherwise stated \u2014 to thirteen semester credits. In addition, the student on probation is ineligible for directed/independent studies and may be required to accept academic counseling. Academic Suspension A student is placed on academic suspension after he/she has been on academic probation for one semester and has failed in the following semester to raise his/her semester and cumulative GPA to the level required for adequate progress. The University, however, reserves the right to suspend a student without a prior semester on academic probation. Academic probation may be continued in lieu of suspension if the University of Jamestown cumulative grade point average improves but is below that required for good standing, providing the semester average is at or above adequate progress level. A student who has been suspended may request re-admittance to the University of Jamestown after one semester. His or her status will be reviewed by the Provost and the Dean of Students. The student will be notified whether he or she will be re-admitted on academic probation or denied admission. Incompletes Incompletes must be finished within four weeks of the beginning of the next semester. No final action will be taken until the four-week period has elapsed. Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations41Exceptions to Academic Regulations Academic regulations exist in order to ensure integrity and fairness in the academic programs of the University. Therefore, exceptions to academic regulations will be granted only when there are extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control that justify special consideration. If a student believes that such circumstances exist, he or she may petition for an exception to an academic regulation. The petition process is outlined below:1. The student obtains a petition form from the Registrar's Office. 2. The student fills out the petition, stating clearly the reasons for the request and providing any supporting evidence. 3. The student signs the petition and returns it to the Registrar's Office. The registrar then passes the petition to the Provost. Upon the student's request, the registrar will also make an appointment for the student to speak with the Provost concerning the petition. 4. The Provost considers the petition, and if he/she deems it necessary, consults with the Curricular Council. 5. The Provost approves or denies the petition and returns the petition with an explanation to the registrar who informs the student of the decision.Eligibility Student organization offices are restricted to full-time students who are not on academic probation. Athletic eligibility is granted only to students who are not on academic probation and who meet the standards of the Great Plains Athletic Conference. Student Papers Faculty may dispose of papers, projects, quizzes, exams, or other materials that remain unclaimed or unexamined by the student on the last day of classes of the next semester (excluding summer semester.) Transfer Courses All students enrolled at the University of Jamestown who wish to complete courses at other academic institutions and to transfer those courses for credit to the University of Jamestown must have those courses pre-approved through the registrar's office. Whether a course corresponds in content and quality to a University of Jamestown course will be determined by the registrar in conversation with the relevant department chair and the Provost. A minimal expectation is that the course in question comes from an institution that is accredited by a CHEA approved regional accrediting association of schools and colleges that offers either associate or bachelor degrees. Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations42A minimum of 124 semester credits must be earned. At least 45 credits must be upper-division (300-400) level. A maximum of 64 semester credits will be accepted from a junior college. The credits must include the following: General Education Requirements The general education requirements at the University of Jamestown represent the faculty's best judgment regarding the knowledge and skills that any college-educated person should have. We believe that a broad general education program including exposure to diverse academic disciplines helps students in many ways. For example, such a program: 1. provides students with information that assists them in choosing a major or minor area of study 2. encourages students to interact with faculty members and students outside their own disciplines 3. stimulates students to think about issues and ideas of which they were previously unaware 4. enables students to make cross-disciplinary connections 5. prepares students to better understand written and oral discussions in which they will participate. In addition to supporting these wider goals, however, our general education program is designed to help students meet eleven more specific outcomes that we deem important for college-educated people: Aesthetic Awareness: Graduates will recognize the role of aesthetic expression in daily life. Christian Literacy: Graduates will describe the basic tenets of the historic Christian faith and can explain the implications of those tenets for ethical living.Cultural and Social Literacy: Graduates will demonstrate a basic level of knowledge of the social sciences and humanities. Ethical Literacy: Graduates will describe and compare several major ethical theories and concepts to explain how these theories apply to particular issues, contexts, and communities. Global Awareness: Graduates will develop a broad world view and demonstrate knowledge of global issues and other nations and cultures. Information Literacy: Graduates will identify, evaluate, and apply information resources to specific tasks and use the appropriate citation method for their discipline. Quantitative Literacy: Graduates will perform mathematical computations and identify and draw inferences from relevant quantitative information. Scientific Literacy: Graduates will apply fundamental scientific principles and methods of inquiry and recognize the impact of scientific research and technology on individuals and the world. Oral communication: Graduates will communicate effectively orally.Written Communication: Graduates will communicate effectively in writing. Critical Thinking: Graduates will be able to logically evaluate evidence, analyze and synthesize information from multiple sources, and reflect on varied perspectives.Requirements for the Degree43General Education Requirement (Bachelor of Arts) Moral & Civic Education Credits UJ Foundations 1 Ethics 3 American Government or American History 3 Global Perspectives 6 An Approved International Experience or 31 Semester Credits 10-13 Communication Skills Credits Freshman Composition I 3 (with a grade of C- or higher) Freshman Composition with Literature II 3 (with a grade of C- or higher) Oral Communication 3 (Comm 102 or 201) Semester Credits 9 Cultural & Social Heritage Credits Religion 3 Literature or History 3 Art, Music, or Theatre 3 Psychology, Sociology, Political Science, or Economics 110, 201, or 202 5-6 Semester Credits 14-15 Natural Science & Quantitative Reasoning Credits Natural Science (with lab) 4Foundations of Science 2 2 Computer Science 3 Mathematics 3 Total Semester Credits 12 Personal Wellness Credits Fitness and Wellness/Physical Activity Course 1 Semester Credits 1 Total Semester Credits 45-50 1 The six credits may be satisfied in one of two ways: Students with at least two years of the same high school foreign language with grades of C or better may select six hours from additional foreign language courses or other courses identified as meeting this requirement in the course catalog.

A student who selects a major in any Field of Study may only choose a minor that is in the same Field of Study if at least nine credits are unique to the minor. A student cannot have the exact same major and minor; nor can a student have the exact same major concentration and minor. Fields of Study Accounting Biology, Clinical Laboratory Science Business Administration, Financial Planning and Wealth Management, Health and Fitness Administration, Liberal Arts Business Studies, MISCharacter in Leadership Chemistry, Biochemistry, Science Composite Education Communication, Mass CommunicationComputer science, MIS Criminal Justice Elementary EducationEngineering English, Creative Writing, International Studies Exercise ScienceFine Arts in Theatre Fine Arts in Studio Art French, Global StudiesGerman, Global Studies History, Global Studies Information TechnologyMathematics Mechanical Engineering Music, Fine Arts in MusicNursing Physical Education, Health and Fitness Administration Political Science, International StudiesPsychology Religion/Philosophy, Christian Ministry, Religion, Philosophy Spanish, International StudiesRequirements for the Degree46Major Field of Study At least half of the candidate's major must be completed at the University of Jamestown; modification of this requirement may be made by the department chair with the consent of the Provost. Residence Requirement To fulfill the residence requirement, a minimum of thirty-five semester credits must be earned at the University of Jamestown, including a final full-time semester prior to graduation, unless the final semester or year is completed elsewhere as part of an approved University of Jamestown degree program or a petition is submitted to the Provost. All students enrolled at the University of Jamestown who wish to complete courses at other academic institutions and to transfer those courses for credit to the University of Jamestown must have those courses pre-approved through the Registrar's Office. Whether a course corresponds in content and quality to a University of Jamestown course will be determined by the registrar in conversation with the relevant department chair and the Provost. A minimal expectation is that the course in question comes from an institution that is accredited by a CHEA approved regional accrediting association of schools and colleges that offers either associate or bachelor degrees. Graduation Application A Graduation Intent Form must be submitted to the registrar at least one semester prior to graduation. This is the responsibility of the student. Forms are available in the Registrar's Office.Grade Point Average1. Entry into the various majors of the University of Jamestown requires a grade of at least C- in each prerequisite course. 2. In addition, progression within the major is dependent on maintaining a grade of C- in each course. However, graduation from the University of Jamestown requires a cummulative GPA of 2.0. 3. A grade of D- received in a course at the University of Jamestown will count toward total credits but will not satisfy major or minor requirements. Commencement Graduating seniors are expected to attend and participate fully in graduation activities including baccalaureate and commencement ceremonies. Mid-year or other graduates unable to return for commencement may request their degrees in absentia by writing to the Provost. Requirements for the Degree47Assessment The University of Jamestown has a genuine interest in a continuing assessment of student learning as a way of measuring its success in meeting its mission and enhancing its academic programs. The assessment process is guided by the foundational values and the mission of the University. To clarify this connection, fourteen institutional objectives provide linkage between program outcomes and the university mission. These are listed below: Institutional Objectives: University of Jamestown - a) maintains academic, professional and pre-professional programs that prepare students for entry into the work force or for further education. (Academic Preparation) b) provides students with a general education curriculum rooted in the liberal arts to improve critical thinking skills and increase general knowledge. (General Education) c) provides opportunities for students to learn basic ethical principles and to engage in character-building activities. (Character Building) d) provides support services to assist students in achieving their academic goals. (Academic Support Services) e) manages financial resources to support its objectives and strategies in a manner that ensures the institution' s viability in the short and long-term. (Sound Fiscal Management) f) provides extra-curricular opportunities for students to learn and grow on a personal, social, and civic level. (Student Support Services) g) fosters an appreciation of difference through the integration of curricular and co-curricular experiences that are intentionally developed to help students integrate into a global society. (Diversity) h) operates within a system of shared governance in which the opinions and values of constituents contribute to decisions and responsibility for success is shared. (Shared Governance) i) recognizes and fosters opportunities to connect with, integrate into, and participate with the larger community in which it resides. (Community) j) maintains the infrastructure necessary to support both the academic program and student life. (Infrastructure) k) demonstrates its commitment to continuous improvement through discipline-specific and pedagogical faculty development. (Faculty Development) l) demonstrates its commitment to continuous improvement through staff development. (Staff Development) m) provides opportunities for students to be involved in Christian religious life activities and to explore their faith. (Christian Life/Religious Life Environment) n) uses current technology to enhance student learning, administrative efficiency, and institutional effectiveness. (Technology) A partial list of assessment activities follows: a) administration of the Noel/Levitz Survey of Student Satisfaction and the University of Jamestown Student Survey of Institutional Effectiveness (SSIE); Assessment48b) administration of standardized testing to graduating seniors in selected departments (e.g. MFT, CBE); c) analysis of reported performance on graduate and professional school examinations (including the Graduate Record Examination: General and Subject Tests, the Pre-Professional Skills Test and the Praxis II in Education); the Medical College Admission Test, the Law School Admission Test, and the National Council Licensure Examination in Nursing; d) internal academic program reviews rotating all departments on an every 5 year basis, with periodic external reviews; e) analysis of placement information based on alumni surveys; f) administration of a faculty and staff survey to gain knowledge of the opinion of faculty and staff about the institution; g) analysis of exit surveys from graduating seniors and classroom assessment summaries from every academic department; h) analysis of student retention, experiential education, career planning between education and career; i) linking assessment results to program development, and; j) an ongoing evaluation of our assessment program. While formal and informal reports from alumni, employers, trustees and other constituencies comprise additional information relevant to assessment, student input constitutes the critical source of assessment data. Therefore, all students will be expected at various junctures during their tenure at University of Jamestown to contribute to our assessment program by completing surveys, standardized tests, and exit surveys as required by their curriculum. Tk20 by Watermark The University of Jamestown utilizes Tk20 by Watermark, a web-based assessment system, to capture data from rubrics, course evaluations, satisfaction surveys, field experience binders, and other electronic assessment tools. Reports on these data contribute to our assessment of program outcomes and institutional objectives by providing valuable insight into student learning, faculty performance, campus life, and much more. Tk20 accounts for faculty, staff, and students are accessible at jc.tk20.com. If you have any questions on Tk20, please contact the Tk20 Unit Administrator.

AssessmentTk20 Unit Administratoramunns@uj.edu701-356-2136 ext. 5901Assessment49Harris Widmer Center for Excellence in Information Technology In early 1999, the University of Jamestown launched a major new initiative in information technology for the 21st century with the establishment of the Harris Widmer Center for Excellence in Information Technology. The first venture of the newly established Center was to increase students' access to computers. Each room is networked for access to e-mail, the internet, and other network services. This dramatic enhancement of computer accessibility to students was made at no additional charge to the students. The Center's establishment was made possible with a generous lead gift from Harris and Arlyce Widmer, Fargo, N.D. Mr. Widmer is a graduate of the class of 1958 and a long-time College trustee. The Center's facets include: Studies in Information Technology (See Computer Science section). Software skills certification, which involves training in word processing, spread sheets, databases, e-mail and Internet, web page design, presentation software, graphics, desktop publishing, and networking. Special internship opportunities, which will greatly enhance the resum\u00e9 of University of Jamestown graduates.Roland E. Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business Since its launch in the fall of 2000, the Roland E. Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business has become a premier center for management education with programs that compare favorably with those of any liberal arts college in the country. The Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business was named in honor of Roland E. Meidinger, trustee emeritus and longtime benefactor of University of Jamestown, and the recipient of the honorary degree Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa, from the college in 1976. In order to accomplish its mission of excellence in business education and to achieve its strategic goals, the Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business has implemented several major initiatives that have resulted in the following distinctive program hallmarks: Accreditation and Certification of Programs The following degree programs offered through the Roland E. Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business by its Department of Business, Accounting, and Economics are accredited by the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE): Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration with concentrations in accounting, business communication, financial planning, general management, global business, hospitality and tourism, and marketing Bachelor of Arts degree in accounting Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts Business Studies Bachelor of Arts in Financial Planning and Wealth Management. Center for Excellence50Center for Excellence Strong and Talented Faculty The faculty in the Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business are talented, respected, highly collaborative, committed to excellence in teaching and student learning, and are either doctorally- or professionally-qualified to teach in their particular disciplines. Innovative New Programs An important initiative of the Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business is the development of new programs that expand offerings and widen the range of choices for students. The center has recently developed an option of a concentration in financial planning in the accounting major, a major in liberal arts business studies, liberal arts concentrations in the business administration major, an interdisciplinary major in health and fitness administration, and concentrations in hospitality and tourism management, and information technology.Expanded Opportunities for International Experiences The Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business, through its Department of Business, Accounting, and Economics, currently offers students the following opportunities for international study in business, economics, and/or accounting: IACBE International Partnership for Study Abroad Irish American Scholars Study Program International Student Exchange Program (ISEP) Expanded Internship and Experiential Education Opportunities The expanded opportunities for internships and other types of field experiences developed by the Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business provide students with experiential learning that is vital to the complete education of business students. Nationally Recognized Student Organizations The Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business currently has a very strong and active chapter of Phi Beta Lambda, which is a national student business organization.51 With the first class of their first semester, University of Jamestown students begin a journey\u2014a journey to success. The metaphor of the journey is apt because it reminds both students and those working with them to keep thinking about where the chosen path will lead. We want each student to make the most of his or her four years at the University of Jamestown. And as with any journey, the best way to make the most of it is to keep one's eyes open in order to see as much as possible. Therefore, the Jamestown Journey to Success emphasizes the importance of looking: Students Look Inward through examining their own interests, strengths, goals, and dreams. This begins in UJ Foundations where students meet in small groups each week with a faculty/staff teacher and an upper-class student guide. Teachers and guides provide the students with analytic instruments and hold discussions to help them think carefully about what they want to accomplish both inside and outside the classroom during the next four years. This results in thoughtful choices of major and minor areas of study as well as involvement in co-curricular activities. Students Look Outward by asking how to take the talents and strengths they have identified and use them not only to accomplish their own goals but to serve those around them. All students at the University of Jamestown do community service. Students also have the chance to help others distant from the college through mission trips with groups such as Habitat for Humanity and the Presbyterian Church in Kenya or to serve those in our own community through groups like Students of Service, Champions of Character, and many others.The Jamestown Journey to Success Students Look Beyond in order to learn about people, cultures, and ways of life different than their own. This happens through overseas travel to places like China, Costa Rica, Kenya, or Italy or within the U.S. to cities like Minneapolis, Chicago, or New York. But travel is not the only way to learn about new ideas and diverse perspectives; right on our own campus students can take advantage of International Week, Foreign Film Festivals, or interaction with international students. Students Look Forward as they make use of college resources to prepare themselves for that next step into the world of work or further graduate study. Career Services offers student individual assistance in searching for a job or selecting a graduate school. University programs allow students to choose among a wide range of sessions on topics such as networking, interviewing, business etiquette, resume writing, applying to graduate school, and many more. The Jamestown Journey is our way of ensuring that each student's journey fits his or her needs, helps meet the needs of others, and leads to a successful future. The Journey also includes a four-year graduation guarantee, a guaranteed internship, and a co-curricular transcript for students who want them. * There are very few times in students' lives when they will be surrounded by so many others dedicated to helping them reach their goals as during the years of their journey at the University of Jamestown. *The four-year graduation guarantee and the guaranteed internship are subject to specific conditions. More information is available in the Registrar's Office.Academic Departments53Art Associate Professor Cox (chair) Mission Statement The mission of the Art Department of the University of Jamestown is to prepare students in visual creativity, interpersonal and group communications proficiency, and to provide for them a learning experience that will help develop their personal growth within the college's liberal arts curriculum. We seek to expose students to traditional and innovative art cultures, trends, and media. From these studies and experiences, students will achieve academic excellence through a better understanding of the arts, civilization, religion, languages, literature, philosophy, government, and geography.

Health-Related Majors A bachelor's degree is granted from University of Jamestown to students completing the clinical laboratory science major. The number of credits within this major make the BS degree the best option. Students seeking a BA in this major can expect to exceed the 124 semester credits required for graduation. Clinical Laboratory Science Major Clinical laboratory scientists (medical technologists/medical laboratory scientists) are health professionals who supervise and conduct laboratory diagnostic tests on patients' body fluids and/or tissues, assisting the physician with diagnoses and treatments. An education in this field will prepare the student for a variety of career opportunities. Two options are available in preparing for a career in clinical laboratory science (CLS.) Students can plan programs so that they need not decide immediately which option they will choose. Each includes a year of clinical internship in an accredited medical laboratory science (clinical laboratory science) program and prepares the student for the medical laboratory scientist certification exam from the Board of Registry of the American Society of Clinical Pathologists. As a member of the Western College Alliance for Medical Laboratory Science, a cooperative education program between several universities and colleges in the Midwest, University of Jamestown is affiliated with the clinical laboratory science program at the University of North Dakota (UND). The final professional year begins with a summer semester at the University of North Dakota. Fall and spring semesters are then spent at one of the many possible clinical sites. There are currently more than twenty-five clinical affiliates in North Dakota, Minnesota, and other western states. Option A Students can complete Option A in four years, earning a Bachelor of Science degree from University of Jamestown with a major in clinical laboratory science. Three years are spent on campus at University of Jamestown completing prerequisite course work and general education requirements. During the fall semester of the junior year, the student applies to the affiliated CLS program. The senior year consists of twelve months of specialized clinical laboratory science education, beginning with summer session at the UND campus in Grand Forks. Fall and spring semesters are spent at one of the many clinical sites. Option B Option B is a five-year program. The student spends four years at University of Jamestown completing a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in biology or chemistry before entering the one-year clinical training. During the fall semester of the senior year, the student may apply either to the UND program or to any accredited CLS program nationwide to complete the professional internship. Program note The Clinical Laboratory Science major prepares students to transfer in three years to a CLS/MLS program outside of University of Jamestown. Acceptance into the off campus program is independent from University of Jamestown. Students should consult with the program director, registrar, Business Office, and Financial Aid Office early in their course of study to ensure a clear understanding of the CLS program, application procedure, and financial aid implications for the off-campus portion of the course of study.Biology60Biology There are two prerequisite courses (Hematology and Parasitology) that must be taken online from UND (or another institution) at the student's own expense. In addition to the bachelor of science general education requirements, the following courses are required for students planning a major in clinical laboratory science: At University of Jamestown Dept.

Accreditation Specialized business accreditation by an independent, external accrediting body is a means by which students, parents, the business community, and other stakeholders of the College can be assured that the institution's business degree programs meet high standards of excellence and follow best practice in business education. 65 University of Jamestown has received specialized accreditation for its business programs through the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE), located in Olathe, Kansas. The business programs in the following degrees are accredited by the IACBE: Bachelor of Arts in business administration with concentrations in accounting, business communication, financial planning, general management, global business, and marketing. Bachelor of Arts in accounting Bachelor of Arts in financial planning and wealth management Bachelor of Arts in liberal arts business studies Study Abroad Opportunities The Department of Business, Accounting, and Economics currently offers students the following opportunities for international study:1. In cooperation with the Presbyterian Church (USA), the British Council, and the Department for Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland, the department participates in the Irish/American Scholars Program. This program provides students with the opportunity to apply to study for either one semester or a full academic year at one of our partner institutions in Northern Ireland: Queen's University-Belfast, University of Ulster-Coleraine, University of Ulster, Magee College-Derry, University of Ulster-Jordanstown, University of Ulster-Belfast, or the Belfast Metropolitan College. 2. University of Jamestown is a member of the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP), which is the world's largest network of colleges and universities cooperating to provide international educational experiences for their students. Through the ISEP network, students have access to affordable, high-quality study abroad programs in any discipline, including business, economics, and accounting. The reciprocal exchange program is designed so that students pay all of their normal fees, including tuition and room and board, to University of Jamestown and then study abroad for a semester, a full academic year, or a summer. Programs in business, economics, and accounting are available in more than sixty universities throughout Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, South America, Central America, and North America. Requirements for the Accounting Major At the recommendation of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), state law now requires that candidates who sit for the certified public accountant examination must have completed 150 academic credit-hours with either a major or concentration in accounting. The intent of the AICPA recommendation is to generate CPAs who possess a broader base of knowledge that extends beyond accounting. University of Jamestown currently requires a total of 124 credit hours for graduation with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Therefore, state law requires CPA candidates to complete an additional twenty-two credit hours in order to sit for the CPA exam. The Department of Business, Accounting, and Economics offers two accounting program options. The first option, the accounting major, consists of the sixty-four credit-hour major requirements listed below. The second option, an accounting major with a concentration in financial planning, consists of the sixty-four credit-hour major requirements, plus a twenty-one credit-hour concentration. Students who plan to sit for the CPA exam may complete the recommended courses listed for either option in order to fulfill the additional twenty-two-credit-hour CPA requirement. They may also choose to complete the additional credits through graduate study.

In criminal justice, students are prepared to pursue one of three distinct, though not necessarily mutually exclusive, options. The focus of the major is a solid preparation for entry-level careers in law enforcement, corrections, or adult or juvenile probation and parole. In addition, discipline-specific writing is an explicit student outcome goal to which the department is committed. A grade of C- or above must be earned in all courses that are required in a major or a minor. Intended Student Learning Outcomes for the Criminal Justice Major Students in the Criminal Justice Major will be able to: 1) Demonstrate that they have knowledge of the dominant theories and approaches for understanding deviant and criminal behavior. 2) Demonstrate that they understand the basic structure of the American criminal justice system, which includes policing, courts, and corrections. 3) Demonstrate that they have the writing skills and knowledge of the basic reporting requirements needed to be successful as criminal justice practitioners. 4) Demonstrate basic knowledge of the criminal law and legal procedures sufficient to prepare them for an entry level police position. 5) Demonstrate knowledge of institutional and community corrections sufficient for an entry level position in corrections, probation, or parole.

The program seeks to help students express themselves through widely varied artistic means. The program offers three majors: Fine Arts-Studio Fine Arts-Music Fine Arts-Theatre Students majoring in fine arts are strongly encouraged to work in close cooperation with their respective departments to develop their artistic abilities through participation in the various public outlets available at the College, such as art shows, theatre productions, and musical ensembles. If further concentration in a particular area beyond that required for the fine arts major is desired, students are encouraged to explore the possibility of a concurrent minor in a particular area. The requirement for the fine arts major is forty-two semester credits, including twenty-six semester credits in an area of concentration and two approved courses in each of the other areas. The department chair of an area of concentration may recommend additional courses as electives from among its own offerings or from supporting fields in accordance with the student's educational and career objectives. 122Foreign Language Associate Professor Stevenson (chair); Assistant Professor Lefter Mission Statement The mission of the Foreign Language Department at University of Jamestown is to help prepare the liberal arts student as a citizen of our global community. We seek to expose students to other languages and cultures, thereby broadening their concepts of language, civilization, culture, philosophy, government, religion, geography, art, aesthetics, and literature with a firm anchoring in a Christian perspective and academic excellence. In order to determine student progress toward these ends, the department assesses student learning and departmental effectiveness on a regular basis. Foreign Language Department Overview The Foreign Language Department of the University of Jamestown offers a wide range of language learning opportunities that allow students to continue to learn languages they began in high school or begin to learn new languages they first encounter at the university level. Majors are available in German, French and Spanish to students who pursue a semester or two summers of study abroad; language minors in German, French, and Spanish can be completed on campus by students majoring in other subjects, and the interdisciplinary Italian Studies minor offers a combination of language, history, art and study abroad to students majoring in other subjects as well. Courses in beginning and intermediate-level Mandarin Chinese are offered every fall semester by a visiting scholar from the University's partner Huizhou University in Huizhou City, Guangdong Province, PR China. Courses in Portuguese, Romanian and Latin are also offered on demand. Intended Student Learning Outcomes for the Foreign Language Major Every course offered through the Foreign Language Department is designed to develop language proficiency in reading, writing, speaking and listening in the target language as well as presenting aspects of the cultures where the target language is spoken. The four major skills of language acquisition form the core outcomes for students majoring in German, French and Spanish: 1. Reading: The student will be able to read unedited target language texts in his/her field of interest. 2. Writing: The student will be able to express him/herself in writing in the target language on a wide variety of topics of personal interest and will be able to produce simple to complex academic texts. 3. Speaking: The student will become a more effective oral communicator in the target language and will be able to speak on a variety of personal topics with accuracy of tense usage and will be able to give opinions on abstract topics of personal interest. 4. Listening: The student will be able to follow the gist of conversations among native speakers and will be able to understand broadcasts and films in the target language with adequate help and preparation. In addition, students who complete target-language majors will address the following additional outcomes: 1. Literature: The student will have read and discussed selected poems, novels, short stories, and dramas from a variety of periods and peoples in the literature of the target language. 2. History: The student will be able to discuss important historical events and trends in the country/countries of the target language, including developments in art, music, science, architecture and/or technology.1233. Geography and Culture: The student will be able to identify important geographical, cultural, economic and demographic features of the country/countries in which the target language is spoken. 4. Language Acquisition: The student will demonstrate knowledge about the theoretical challenges inherent in the acquisition of the target language and will demonstrate increased facility in understanding the structure of his/her first language. Placement and Advanced Standing in French, German and Spanish The first semester beginning courses in French, German, and Spanish are aimed at students with no prior instruction in those languages. A student who has completed high school course work in a foreign language is encouraged to consult with foreign language faculty members to receive advanced placement in a course beyond 101. Students who receive advanced placement into French, German, or Spanish 102 and complete the course with an earned grade of C- or higher will also receive three college credits for 101. Students who enroll directly in a 200-level French, German, or Spanish course will receive six advanced placement credits for language courses at the 101 and 102 levels when they complete the 200-level course with a C- or higher. The advanced standing credits count on the student's record but do not count as part of the semester course load. The credits count toward fulfilling general education requirements in the area of Global Perspectives. The advanced standing credits will be awarded at no charge to the student. The Foreign Language Department awards advanced standing credit for the German, French or Spanish 201 course requirement based on student performance on CLEP tests, which are administered through the Career Services. There is a charge for the CLEP exams. Majors in French, German, or Spanish The Foreign Language Department offers majors in French, German, and Spanish that require a minimum of twenty-four credit hours of coursework on campus or the equivalent thereof combined with 12-18 credit hours of advanced language study in the student's major language. The advanced credits will be gained during study abroad or participation in a US-based language immersion program. Students wishing to major in French, German, or Spanish must complete all courses leading to the minor at University of Jamestown, then take additional coursework in their study abroad to complete the major. Credits gained through advanced placement or CLEP exams will be counted as coursework leading to the minor. All external upper-division courses must be approved by the Foreign Language Department prior to the student's study abroad or participation in an immersion program. Courses in the exchange institution that will meet departmental approval include but are not limited to literature of the target language, film, linguistics, grammar and composition, history, communication and media studies, business, music history, and art history. Courses must be taught in the target language in order to be approved for the major. Successful completion of required coursework while enrolled in the exchange institution is a prerequisite for fulfilling requirements for the major. Students are expected to remain in contact with their on-campus language major advisors during the course of their study abroad. Students majoring in French, German, or Spanish may participate in an ISEP-sponsored study abroad program, or they may participate in approved summer immersion or study abroad programs (program list available upon request). Students majoring in Spanish may enroll in two summers of post-minor study in the MLSA-University of Jamestown program at the University of Costa Rica in San Jose. All ISEP participants must present a minimum GPA of 2.75 at the time of application and be accepted into a program that offers the student's major language. The department recommends that students study abroad in their junior year. For more ISEP information, students may consult the ISEP section of this catalog.Foreign Language124 Upon returning from study abroad, the student will be required to present the department with evidence of academic achievement, such as papers, exams, and research projects as proof of fulfillment of the major requirements. An official transcript must be sent from the study abroad institution to the University of Jamestown Registrar's Office. Minors in French, German, or Spanish The Foreign Language Department offers minors in French, German, and Spanish that require twenty-four credit hours of coursework on campus or the equivalent thereof. Of the twenty-four credit hours, at least twelve of the credit hours must be earned in courses at the 300 or 400-level as outlined in the program requirements below. A grade of C- or above must be earned in all courses required for completing the target language minor. Minor in Italian Studies The Italian Studies Minor is an interdisciplinary program that combines language study with selected coursework in Art, Music, Religion & Philosophy and History & Political Science. This program exposes the student to the realities of a different country and provides the language skills that the student can use to seek employment where Italian skills are needed. Additional culture-based coursework in English improves the student's critical thinking skills and/or appreciation for history and the arts. The Italian Studies Minor as a whole exposes the student to sociocultural diversity which facilitates personal growth and linguistic integration in the global society. Courses in Classical and Biblical Languages Courses in New Testament Greek (Rel 301, Rel 302) fulfill the Global Perspectives general education requirement. The Religion Department also offers courses in Biblical Hebrew on request. The Foreign Language Department offers beginning Latin (Flan 300: Special Topics) on request. Special Topics Courses Special Topics courses are offered at the 100 (beginning) and 200 (intermediate) levels in modern foreign languages that are not part of the departmental major or minor language curricula. These currently include beginning and intermediate courses in Mandarin Chinese and beginning-level courses in Portuguese and Romanian. Special Topics courses at the 300 or 400-level can be offered in Spanish, French, or German. These courses are taught in the target language and can used by students to replace any 300-level course for the minor or count toward the major. Special Topics courses in secondary foreign language teaching methods and French, German, or Spanish linguistics are offered on request to students majoring in French, German, or Spanish who are working toward secondary education certification in their teaching majors. These courses are part of a program leading to secondary certification in a foreign language. Any student wishing to pursue secondary certification in French, German or Spanish must consult with the Foreign Language Department Chair as to the current availability of the program. For the academic year 2018-2019, the program is suspended. A grade of C- or above must be earned in all courses that are required in a major or a minor. Requirements for the French Major Dept.

Approved areas for teacher licensure at University of Jamestown include biology, chemistry, English, foreign language, history, mathematics, music, physical education, and elementary education. Since each state has its own licensure requirements and administers its own licensing process, candidates who plan to teach in states other than North Dakota should consult with that state's education department by writing to the specific state(s) that they are considering, or visiting the intended teaching state's web site for licensure requirements. Completion of noted courses in the early childhood concentration, along with a completed major in elementary Education, will qualify the pre- or in-service teacher for preschool or kindergarten teaching in North Dakota. The course Educ 418A: Student Teaching in the Elementary School will be 10 semester credits and taken during the same semester as Educ 417-6: Student Teaching in the Kindergarten (6 semester credits). Changing state/federal standards and common core standards may require program modifications. Candidates for the North Dakota Educator's Professional License in Secondary Education must choose at least one major in a field taught in public schools. Candidates are responsible for meeting the major requirements as well as the professional component requirements. Candidates seeking licensure in secondary Education must confer with an Education Department advisor during registration. Along with the major requirements, forty-seven semester credits in the Education Department are required for University of Jamestown's recommendation for teacher licensure in North Dakota. (ND Licensure: www.nd.gov/espb) Candidates are encouraged to join the Student North Dakota United (SNDU), a professional organization, to gain greater knowledge of their field and to meet other pre-service and in-service Educators. This organization also provides liability insurance during student teaching. Candidates may use other sources for liability insurance if they wish but must provide evidence of insurance to the department. An alternative is the International Christian Education Association. Other professional organizations in early childhood, reading, math, music, science, and special needs also afford opportunities for participation and access to Liability Insurance. Students who meet the eligibility requirements are invited to join Pi Lambda Theta, the International Honor Society and Professional Association in Education. (Programs and requirements are subject to change to meet state approval.)203Other Academic Programs and Courses Minor in Character in Leadership Assistant Professor Hunt; Lecturer Hoke Mission Statement As an academic community dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge in an atmosphere of Christian love, University of Jamestown recognizes the need for leaders of integrity and courage who are actively concerned for the needs of our world.

Students completing the program receive two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from the University of Jamestown and a Bachelor of Science in engineering from the university at which they complete their engineering courses. Recent University of Jamestown engineering students have completed their studies at several universities, including: * Montana Tech (College of Mineral Science and Technology) * North Dakota State University * South Dakota School of Mines * University of North Dakota * University of South Dakota * Washington University, St. Louis, Mo. Pre-Law Law schools do not generally require a specific pre-law program. Those pursuing an undergraduate curriculum in preparation for law school should consult with the director of the Student Success Center and the history-political science faculty . Health-Related Pre-Professional Preparation The University of Jamestown offers pre-professional preparation for a number of health-related fields such as medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatry, osteopathy, chiropractic, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. Traditionally, more than 85 percent of our science (biology and chemistry) majors pursue further study or professional degrees in the health professions, graduate research, and/or teaching. Note: Students preparing for health profession programs should obtain scheduling advice from advisors in biology or chemistry before registering for classes. Pre-Medicine Most American medical colleges select for admission only those applicants with a four-year college degree and prefer students with a well-rounded liberal arts education. Admission to medical school is strongly influenced by two measures: the student's score on the nationally administered Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and the overall grade point average (GPA). The University of Jamestown students historically have received excellent preparation for successful performance on the MCAT. We believe the key to this success is the availability of our instructors to help students. Students' scholastic achievements and their successful attainment of career goals are important to us. Pre-medicine students are not limited to a single set of courses. Students plan their programs in consultation with the pre-medical advisors. Medical schools usually require only a few basic courses. Beyond this minimum, courses may be chosen according to the student's own interests. The majority of the University of Jamestown pre-medical students choose to major in either biology, chemistry, or biochemistry; but a major in a different area may be satisfactory. It should be noted, however, that the first two years of medical school consist of intensive coursework in biology and chemistry .Pre-Professional Preparation210Suggested Biology Courses: Pre-Medicine students should have schedule plans checked by a biology advisor .

United States dental schools require that applicants take the Dental Admission Test (DAT) and schools of optometry require the Optometry Admission Test (OAT). Students interested in these fields should contact advisors in biology or chemistry to prepare a course program to meet their individual objectives. Also, professional schools may differ in what courses they desire applicants to have taken. Pre-Pharmacy The University of Jamestown traditionally has provided a strong background for students pursuing a degree in pharmacy. The Student Success Center and health professions advisors should be consulted when planning a pre-pharmacy schedule.Pre-Professional Preparation211Pre-Professional Preparation Pre-Physical Therapy There are two avenues to be admitted into the University of Jamestown Physical Therapy Program, Freshman Direct Entry and PTCAS (Physical Therapist Centralized Application Service), www.ptcas.org.
