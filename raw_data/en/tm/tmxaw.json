Johnson & Johnson, in close coordination with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has updated its U.S. COVID-19 Vaccine [Fact Sheet](http://www.janssencovid19vaccine.com/) to increase awareness about the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. Language about the risk of TTS has been added to the first page of the Fact Sheet to increase its prominence. Following the update to the Fact Sheet, the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is now authorized in the U.S. for use in individuals 18 years of age and older for whom other FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate, as well as for individuals 18 years of age and older who elect to receive the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine because they would otherwise not receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This is consistent with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) [recommendations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#considerations-Janssen) in December 2021 that express a clinical preference for individuals to receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Data continue to support a favorable benefit-risk profile for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in adults, when compared with no vaccine. Johnson & Johnson continues to collaborate with health authorities and regulators around the world to ensure healthcare professionals and individuals are warned and fully informed about reports of TTS, enabling correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and expedited reporting. The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine plays a crucial role in the global fight to end the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company continues to focus its efforts on ensuring its vaccine is available during the pandemic where people are most in need. # # # AUTHORIZATION OF USE The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is authorized for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for active immunization to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 18 years of age and older for whom other FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate, and in individuals 18 years of age and older who elect to receive the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine because they would otherwise not receive a COVID-19 vaccine. \u00b7 Primary vaccination regimen for the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is a single-dose (0.5 mL). \u00b7 A single Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine booster dose (0.5 mL) may be administered at least 2 months after the primary vaccination with the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. \u00b7 A single booster dose of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (0.5 mL) may be administered as a heterologous booster dose following completion of primary vaccination with another authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. The dosing interval for the heterologous booster dose is the same as that authorized for a booster dose of the vaccine used for primary vaccination. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WHAT SHOULD YOU MENTION TO YOUR VACCINATION PROVIDER BEFORE YOU GET THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE? Tell the vaccination provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: \u00b7 have any allergies \u00b7 have a fever \u00b7 have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner \u00b7 have ever had a low level of platelets (blood cells that help your body stop bleeding) \u00b7 are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system \u00b7 are pregnant or plan to become pregnant \u00b7 are breastfeeding \u00b7 have received another COVID-19 vaccine \u00b7 have ever fainted in association with an injection WHO SHOULD NOT GET THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE? You should not get the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine if you: \u00b7 had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine. \u00b7 had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine. \u00b7 had a blood clot along with a low level of platelets (blood cells that help your body stop bleeding) following Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine or following AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine (not authorized or approved in the United States). HOW IS THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE GIVEN? The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine will be given to you as an injection into the muscle. Primary Vaccination: The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a single dose. Booster Dose: \u00b7 A single booster dose of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine may be administered at least two months after primary vaccination with the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. \u00b7 A single booster dose of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine may be administered after completing primary vaccination with a different authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. Please check with your health care provider regarding timing of the booster dose. WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE? Side effects that have been reported with the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine include: \u00b7 Injection site reactions: pain, redness of the skin, and swelling. \u00b7 General side effects: headache, feeling very tired, muscle aches, nausea, fever. \u00b7 Swollen lymph nodes. \u00b7 Blood clots. \u00b7 Unusual feeling in the skin (such as tingling or a crawling feeling) (paresthesia), decreased feeling or sensitivity, especially in the skin (hypoesthesia). \u00b7 Persistent ringing in the ears (tinnitus). \u00b7 Diarrhea, vomiting. Severe Allergic Reactions There is a remote chance that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received your vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: \u00b7 Difficulty breathing \u00b7 Swelling of your face and throat \u00b7 A fast heartbeat \u00b7 A bad rash all over your body \u00b7 Dizziness and weakness Blood Clots with Low Levels of Platelets Blood clots involving blood vessels in the brain, lungs, abdomen, and legs along with low levels of platelets (blood cells that help your body stop bleeding), have occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. In people who developed these blood clots and low levels of platelets, symptoms began approximately one to two-weeks after vaccination. Blood clots with low levels of platelets following the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine have been reported in males and females, across a wide age range of individuals 18 years and older; reporting has been highest in females ages 30 through 49 years (about 8 cases for every 1,000,000 vaccine doses administered), and about 1 out of every 7 cases has been fatal. You should seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine: \u00b7 Shortness of breath, \u00b7 Chest pain, \u00b7 Leg swelling, \u00b7 Persistent abdominal pain, \u00b7 Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, \u00b7 Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of the injection. Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a disorder that can cause easy or excessive bruising and bleeding due to very low levels of platelets. ITP has occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. In most of these people, symptoms began within 42 days following receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low. If you have ever had a diagnosis of ITP, talk to your vaccination provider before you get the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. You should seek medical attention right away if you develop any of the following symptoms after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine: \u00b7 Easy or excessive bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of the injection, \u00b7 Unusual or excessive bleeding. Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a neurological disorder in which the body's immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis) has occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. In most of these people, symptoms began within 42 days following receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low. You should seek medical attention right away if you develop any of the following symptoms after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine: \u00b7 Weakness or tingling sensations, especially in the legs or arms, that's worsening and spreading to other parts of the body. \u00b7 Difficulty walking. \u00b7 Difficulty with facial movements, including speaking, chewing, or swallowing. \u00b7 Double vision or inability to move eyes. \u00b7 Difficulty with bladder control or bowel function. These may not be all the possible side effects of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. Serious and unexpected effects may occur. The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is still being studied in clinical trials.
