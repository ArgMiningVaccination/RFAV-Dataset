Introduction Reducing neonatal and under-ve childhood mortality and morbidity is a target of the Health Sustainable Development Goal [1]. Immunization in pregnancy provides a promising contributionto achieving this goal [2]. Whilst immunizing pregnant women against tetanus has been practiced for decades, new strategies such as antenatal influenza and pertussis vaccination are now being sys- tematically evaluated and are recommended by WHO [3-5] . Addi- tional promising vaccines are in development for global use in pregnancy such as group B streptococcal (GBS) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines [6-8] . Introduction of these vaccines comes with tremendous poten- tial benet, specically for women and children living in low and middle income countries (LMIC) due to the higher perinatal and http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.07.006 0264-410X/ /C2112016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is much at stake when it comes to immunization of pregnant women. The safety of any product given to primarily healthy mothers and their unborn babies receives intense professional and public scrutiny. First, this is because two lives can be directly affected during a time of vulnerability, yet both are also likely to benet from the preven- tion of serious infections Second, safety concerns are not exclusive to maternal vaccination programs alone since similar concerns are raised with the use of the same vaccines in routine childhood and adult immunization programs (e.g., influenza and pertussis vacci- nes). In turn, a vaccine found to be safe for pregnant women and neonates would likely be well accepted by the general public for other target groups. Thus, the potential benecial and harmful effects of immunization in pregnancy and its ethical implications are augmented by the ramications on routine pediatric and adultimmunization programs. Therefore, thorough assessment of the safety of vaccines during pregnancy is required given the potential for numerous confounding events associated with pregnancy itself in women and the fetus, and in the neonatal period. Particularly challenging for monitoring and communicating the benets and risks of immunization programs in pregnancy is that several common health outcomes may be perceived as both a mea- sure of benet and risk and this assessment may change over time. For example, immunization may decrease the stillbirth rate if a vac- cine decreases infections that lead to stillbirth. However, stillbirths will still occur in pregnancies and may also be perceived and reported as adverse events following immunization. Particularly early during program introduction, the impact of reducing mortality due to immunization may not be detectable on the population level while pregnancy complications, such as stillbirth, are registered. This makes early benet-risk analyses challenging and may compro- mise the viability of an immunization program independently of any causal relationship between the complication and immunization. Therefore, product or program specic safety issues need to be identied to appropriately assess the benet-risk prole of these vaccines and their implementation programs and to protect the target population from unintended harm. On the other hand, unfounded public or professional concerns can jeopardize benecial vaccine programs and need to be rapidly refuted based on rigorous and credible science and globally coordinated decision-making and communication. Addressing these issues requires more than communication strategies. It requires active monitoring and research to enable condent communication with high quality data. As important safety concerns tend to be serious but rare health events, their investigation requires a harmonized approach and needs to be based on large sample sizes to provide satisfactory statistical con- dence of risk estimates and to enable comparison of multiplepopulations and programs. This is best addressed by close global collaboration based on a harmonized approach [9-11] . The general need for a globally concerted approach to actively monitor the safety of vaccines and programs of immunization is recognized by the WHO Global Vaccine Safety Blueprint, the strategic plan of the Global Vaccine Safety Initiative [12]. A recent WHO consultation specically identied the currently fragmented research, the current lack of data comparability as well as the need to improve the quality of safety data to inform decision making and system strengthening [13]. 2. The GAIA project 2.1. Aim and objectives and rst outcomes The GAIA project aims to improve the outcome data quality from clinical vaccine trials in pregnant women with a specic focuson the needs and requirements for safety monitoring in LMIC. GAIA addresses three main objectives to achieving this aim. First, to improve comparability of safety data across products, programs, and populations for effective and efcient strengthening of immu- nization programs in pregnant women. Second, to optimize the value of local investigations by global harmonization of methods. Third, to promote scientic progress by increasing analytic power and options through globally concerted approaches. In a rst step, the GAIA project has established an open and dynamic network of professionals concerned with monitoring the safety of immunization in pregnancy. Together, compiling a shared terminology and developing case denitions for selected obstetric and neonatal outcomes create a common understanding of the out- comes monitored. Consensus guidance is developed for harmo- nized safety monitoring in clinical trials, and tools are created foreffective and efcient data collection, synthesis and pooling, with a focus on LMIC needs and requirements. 2.2. Network The development of a global standard requires the engagement of a large number of stakeholders (e.g. regulatory agencies, public health organizations, academic institutions and health care provi- ders) and experts who will collaborate on a voluntary basis on the development, review and validation of the standards and tools through an iterative process in the framework of multiple stream- lined working groups with a specied task. The GAIA Network is designed as an open and growing forum for professionals sharing the GAIA vision and aim. In the rst year of the project (January to December 2015), the forum of partners, participants and stake- holders has grown to 412 individual professionals. This was achieved by identifying and inviting professionals active in the eld and calling for participation via pertinent professional organi- zations and mailing lists. Table 1 shows their country of origin and the distribution across WHO regions. The formation and coordination of the network and the creation and guidance of the working groups and activities requires adedicated small group of partners driving progress. In the GAIA project, experts from 13 organizations (The US National Institutes of Health, Brighton Collaboration Foundation, World Health Organization, Global Healthcare Consulting, University of Wash- ington, Baylor College of Medicine, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Erasmus Medical Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, St George's, University of London, Public Health Agency Canada, Synapse Research Management Partners and International Alliance for Biological Standardization) collaborate in a carefully designed governance structure to coordinate and guide the activities of the network partners [14]. The GAIA project leverages the unique accrual of expertise in its project partners and the wider network and is designed to achieve its aim by capitalizing on existing methods and infrastructures. In the following sections, we outline the methods and rst outcomes of the GAIA project. 2.3. Standardized case denitions for key outcomes WHO and the Brighton Collaboration (BC) held a consultancy of key stakeholders in July 24-25, 2014 in Geneva to review current practice and advice on a strategic direction towards a harmonized approach for monitoring immunization in pregnancy programs [13]. This meeting highlighted the current lack of harmonization and the missed opportunity of giving added value to individual studies by overcoming fragmented research and diverse approaches through consensus formation and harmonization. For example, there is limited consensus and harmonization across studies and analyses on even the most fundamental terms and5994 J. Bonhoeffer et al. / Vaccine 34 (2016) 5993-5997concepts such as stillbirth or accurate assessment of gestational age[15]. Such differences can signicantly impact interpretation and meaningful data comparisons. The GAIA consortium is developing standardized case deni- tions of key outcomes according to the Brighton Collaboration standard process [16]. Case denition development is prioritized based on the recommendations of the global consultative process held at the World Health Organization in 2014 and by the ad hoc need for monitoring emerging safety concerns [17]. To achieve the need of developing many denitions in a short timeframe, the Brighton Collaboration standard process was expanded to enable ''batch production\" of denitions. Two task forces compris-ing expertise from public health institutes, regulatory authorities,academic and patient care organizations and vaccine manufactur- ers were created, to simultaneously develop ten neonatal and ten obstetric outcome denitions, respectively, in dedicated working groups. These groups are primarily comprised of neonatologists and/or obstetricians while a few coordinating and advising profes- sionals contribute vaccine safety expertise and guided the groups on the Brighton Collaboration standard method of case denition development. Case denitions are developed specically to incor- porate clinical assessment methods commonly used in LMIC to optimize inclusion of cases from all settings. The draft case deni- tions are developed based on literature review and consensus for- mation within the respective working groups. These documents are submitted for peer review by a reference group comprising the GAIA Network of professionals concerned with immunization in pregnancy, the Brighton Collaboration Network of professionalsconcerned with vaccine safety and additional organizations or pro- fessional societies with expertise in the respective outcome. Over- all case denition development was coordinated by Global Health Consulting, the neonatal task force by Baylor College of Medicine and the obstetric task Force by University of Washington. Together with the other partners in the Coordination Team, they were guid- ing the simultaneous activities of over 200 volunteering profes- sionals in the ten working groups, each led by a subject matter expert driving the respective manuscript development. The rst 10 case denitions ( Table 2 ) establishing the proof of principle of this modied approach are published in this special issue of Vac- cine [18-27] . A subsequent set of 10 prioritized case denitions is in development ( Table 2 ). Demonstrating the flexibility, ef- ciency and effectiveness of this established process, an additional working group was formed to develop a case denition of micro- cephaly on fast track in response to the Zika virus epidemic and in preparation of related vaccine development efforts. 2.4. Guidelines and data collection matrix The WHO and the Brighton Collaboration (BC) consultancy also recognized the need for guidance on basic data collection, analysis and presentation of vaccine safety data. This is specically, because no such global consensus guidelines exist to meet the need of con- certed safety monitoring throughout the life cycle of vaccines or for global access in rapidly emerging immunization in pregnancy programs. The GAIA project develops guidelines for harmonized data col- lection, analysis and presentation according to the Brighton Collab- oration standard process [16]. Based on existing Brighton Collaboration guidance documents, St George's, University of Lon- don coordinated the development of the rst GAIA guideline on vaccine safety monitoring in clinical trials, which was nalized fol- lowing wide peer review and feedback from investigators of ongo- ing studies and parallel projects. It is published in this special issue of Vaccine [28]. Table 2 Standardized case denitions developed for the rst 21 obstetric and neonatal outcomes.

Bonhoeffer et al. / Vaccine 34 (2016) 5993-5997 5995St George's, University of London also coordinated the develop- ment of a data collection matrix outlining key variables to be col- lected in different safety monitoring settings during the vaccine and program life cycle. Based on the review of case report forms (CRF) from previous immunization in pregnancy trials and the new case denitions and guidance document a tailored subset was compiled to facilitate harmonized collection of data in CRFs in clinical vaccine trials involving pregnant women where safety is an outcome. It was nalized following wide peer review and feedback from investigators of ongoing studies and parallel pro- jects and is also published in this special issue of Vaccine [29]. 2.5. Tools To further promote a common understanding and shared lan- guage, a list of over 3000 terms comprising obstetric and neonatal outcomes (e.g. stillbirth) and enabling terms (e.g. prematurity) is structured in an ontology catalog demonstrating their hierarchical and conceptual dependencies enriched by synonyms and disease concept descriptions. This is of particular use for the development of multilingual data collection forms. This effort builds on the existing products and expertise at the Enterprise Vocabulary Ser- vices at the National Cancer Institute also in collaboration withthe National Children's Study and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at NIH and will be made available as an dedicated, user friendly, searchable database on the NIH website. The case denitions with the glossary and ontology of terms have enabled creation of a map of disease codes that can be used for retrieval of data on specic outcomes from electronic health care databases (e.g., ICD9, ICD10, MedDRA, WHOArt, and READ). The mapped disease codes will be made available via the same GAIA terminology database described above. A systematic litera- ture search on existing observational studies around pertussis and influenza maternal immunization safety was coordinated by Erasmus Medical Center and will reflect disease codes and algo- rithms that have been used to extract data from electronic health care databases and prepares for further expansion of the GAIA work into observational settings. The existing Automated Brighton Collaboration Case Classica- tion tool (ABC tool) will be expanded to include the newly devel- oped set of case denitions for automated classication of reported events into their level of diagnostic certainty. The rule based tool classies the information and also prompts the investi- gator to the type of information that should be collected (on follow-up) for a given case to meet the highest possible level of diagnostic certainty [30]. All tools will be described in more detail in an upcoming special issue of Vaccine. 3. Dissemination The GAIA project aims to serve different stakeholders in the eld of immunization in pregnancy. To achieve this aim, GAIA is promot- ing review, use and recommendation of its outcomes by key stakeholders in the eld of global vaccine safety research and mon- itoring including national and international public health and regu- latory organizations as well as vaccine manufacturers. Similarly, the wider scientic community and health care professionals are invited to review outcomes early in the process, provide comments and utilize the shared network, standards and tools. This effort is facilitated by engagement and dialogue with stakeholder organiza- tions, presentations and workshops at scientic conferences, regular newsletters and publication in the scientic literature. All outputs are made available through the GAIA website [31]. Immunization in pregnancy is an evolving eld, and adaptationof standards and tools to specic vaccines, protocols, populations, geographic regions, and other factors is necessary when evaluating the safety of vaccines in pregnancy. The Brighton Collaboration is addressing this continuing need and makes available an inven- tory of GAIA standards and related work as part of its online vaccine safety resources for professionals concerned with vaccine safety [32]. Standards and tools should ultimately be applied in clinical tri- als as well as in signal verication and hypothesis testing studies and enable and accelerate multinational collaborative research on immunization in pregnancy. To this end, GAIA inspired an Inter- national Consensus Conference on Harmonized Safety Monitoring of Immunization in Pregnancy in March 2016 at the National Insti- tute of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD, U. S. A. The conference brought together 142 registered participants from regulatoryauthorities, public health institutes, academia and industry to dis- cuss new safety data from immunization in pregnancy studies, to identify converging stakeholder needs and requirements for high quality data, to review GAIA standards and tools for safety moni- toring and to build consensus on the best practice guidance for monitoring vaccine safety in pregnancy in the light of current experience with a focus on LMIC. 3.1. Summary and next steps The GAIA project has established a large and functional network of experts and a purpose infrastructure around rst outputs, which may serve as a platform for continued collaborative improvement of the quality of data generated for strengthening programs of immunization in pregnancy with specic focus on LMIC. The immediate next outputs will be the next set of eleven case deni- tions and the nalized online services and tools. Capitalizing on the initial achievements of the GAIA project and following the recommendations of the consensus conference, GAIA could also be effectively utilized as a platform for capacity building in LMIC, specically for monitoring the safety of immunization inpregnancy. Such capacity building could include the development of specic training modules for data safety monitoring boards (DSMBs) and National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs). Investing in a globally concerted approach will giveadded value to the individual studies/investments and strengthen a multinational platform for immunization in pregnancy. With increasing implementation of immunization in pregnancy programs and research in LMIC, innovative approaches to validate the implementation of classic research methods as well as novel study designs and benet-risk monitoring frameworks will be needed as critical next elements of a global active safety monitor- ing infrastructure, which will ultimately allow rapid evaluation and response to safety signals or concerns related to products and programs for maternal immunization.
