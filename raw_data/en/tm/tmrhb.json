She received her Ph.D. in Sociology from UCLA, and undergraduate degree from University of Texas at Austin. Trained as a sociologist, her teaching and research interests include Chinese Americans, Asian Americans, immigration, and health, with a focus on type II diabetes and obesity. She has published a number of chapters and articles on the struggles and challenges of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in their assimilation and adjustment in the U.S. She has collaborated on publications such as \"Physical Activity in Asian American Populations,\" in Physical Activity in Diverse Populations, edited by Melissa Jean Bopp, (Taylor and Francis, 2018) and \"Festival Foods in the Immigrant Diet,\" Journal of Immigrant Minority Health (2013 Oct). Her family was one of the few Chinese American families in the Dallas -Fort Worth area suburb. Her family's home served as the gathering place for father's graduate students from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. She also spent six months in Shanghai in 2009 teaching Chinese university students. She has previously taught classes on Asian Americans, Food, Culture, and Health at CSUN and UCLA. You can find her regularly teaching AAS 100 (Intro to Asian American Studies) and AAS 340 (Asian American Women). She was a visiting scholar at Asian American Research Center on Health, University of California, San Francisco in 2015. Title of Research Project \u2014 Is Assimilation Costing Asian Americans their Health?: Type 2 Diabetes in Asian American Populations, Funded by the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities, National Institute of Health, Grant Number: 1R15MD011666- 01. Background & Purpose \u2014 The diabetes rates for Asian Americans has been increasing over the last twenty years, with over 1 out of 5 Asian Americans having diabetes, almost twice the rates to their White counterparts (Lee et al., 2011; Menke et al., 2015). More worrisome is that about fifty percent of Asian Americans with diabetes are not aware they have the disease (Menke et al., 2015). Studies have shown that Japanese in Hawai'i, Los Angeles, and Seattle were more likely to have diabetes than their counterparts in Japan (Fujimoto, 1995). A more recent study that collected blo od samples from Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Hmong living in Sacramento found that all had significantly higher diabetes rates than those in their country of origin (Stewart et al., 2016). Additionally, those that had spent more than 50% of their life in the U.S. were more likely to have diabetes than those that spent less time, although the results were not statistically significant. We know little about what are the causes of these health disparities, and why the rates of the immigrants and the growing second - generation segment are more at risk than in their respective Asian countries. Together, these observations suggest that assimilation, or the process of becoming American, may put immigrant minority groups at risk for diabetes and other chronic dis eases (Oza - Frank et al 2011; Popkin & Udry, 1998). This project is interested in understanding the specific social processes underlying the growing rates of Type 2 diabetes in Asian American subpopulations -Chinese American, Japanese, American, Filipino Ame rican, Korean American, Vietnamese American, and South Asian. Method - This summer, the research team conducted focus groups (via Zoom) with Chinese, Filipino and Korean American who live in Los Angeles and Orange County to understand how living in the U.S ., culture impacts food habits and health. Updated: March 2021 Page 2 of 76 The focus group study compa res the dietary food habits of three Asian American groups - Filipino Americans, who have the highest diabetes rates among all Asian American groups; Korean Americans who have concerning growing rates of diabetes in the last 10 years; and Chinese Americans, whose diabetes rates are the lowest among all the Asian American groups and hence provides for a useful comparison group. Collectively, the current project will achieve a bet ter understanding of the social processes that contribute to poorer or better health in California's diverse Asian American populations. Student Roles \u2014 Students can play a role by conducting literature review and helping to conduct qualitative analysis. S tudents will receive training in qualitative data analysis using a cultural insider -outsider approach. Students who speak Cantonese, Tagalog, and Korean are especially encouraged to apply. Expectations \u2014 Students with strong writing skills and interest in learning about Asian American research methods are encouraged to apply. Familiarity with Chinese, Filipino, and Korean populations is highly desirable. Coursework in any of the areas of study is helpful: social sciences, Asian American Studies, ethnic stu dies, public health, epidemiology, and/or health education. Other important qualities include good work ethic, able to meet deadlines, and an ability to collaborate with others. Students will gain training in conducting health research with Asian Americ an populations.

College of Health & Human Development Department of Child & Adolescent Development Tissyana Camacho Mentor Bio \u2014 Dr. Camacho obtained a B.A. in Psychology from CSU Northridge and an M.S. and Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology at the University of Michigan. Her research examines ethnic identity development among students of color across the educational pipeline, with a focus on Latino college students. Research Project \u2014 My research examines the developmental nature of ethnic identity (i.e., how ethnic identity changes over time), how et hnic identity develops (i.e., the experiences that contribute to changes in ethnic identity), and how ethnic identity is related to psychological and academic outcomes. I study these topics using multiple methods (e.g., longitudinal survey data and semi -structured interviews) and with ethnically and racially diverse adolescent and young adult populations. My BUILD PODER research assistants will focus on a mixed- methods project where approximately 30 -40 self -identified Latino/a college students were interviewed regarding their ethnicity -related experiences in college. The purpose of this project was to explore how academic and social experiences in college contribute to how one understands his or herself in terms of ethnic identity. For this project, resear ch assistants will be expected transcribe audio files, code semi -structured interview data, and conduct quantitative and qualitative data analysis under the my supervision. Conferences \u2014 I primarily attend the Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) conference and the Society for Research in Adolescence (SRA) conference. In the future, I expect to attend the Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood (SSEA) conference and the Western Psychological Association (WPA) conference. Publications \u2014 Previous publications can be found on my Google Scholar Page Kandice Grote ** NOT ACCEPTING NEW MENTEES FOR 2021 -2022** Mentor Bio \u2014 The opportunity to mentor students through the research process, at the undergraduate level, is a part of my career that has proved to be an invaluable opportunity. I am a developmental cognitive research psychologist by training. At my previous institution (UC Merced), I mentored 8 student s and 12 students from CSUN who have gone onto successful graduate careers. Title of Research Project - The cognitive flexibility of bilingualism. Lab website - www.csunorangelab.com Background & Purpose \u2014 The current research examines cognitive flexibility and benefits of bilingualism and possible mechanisms related to advanced cognition by which such benefits operate. Although older balanced bilinguals (proficient in two languages) display severa l cognitive advantages (Bialystok, 2001; Hakuta & Gould, 1987) when compared to monolinguals, less is known about when such benefits begin during early development. In an effort to examine potential advantages of early bilinguals, this research utilizes a series of visual -spatial memory (spatial cues to remember where missing objects are located), executive functioning tasks, and growth mindset. In Updated: March 2021 Page 4 of 76 addition, this research investigates the influence of several methodological factors on cognitive performance including socioeconomic status (SES), age, and language group. Research Questions/Hypothesis #1: What possible visual -spatial memory and executive functioning advantages exist among early bilingual children vs. monolingual children? #2: Is there a relation ship between executive functioning and advanced visual -spatial memory? #3: What is the relationship between components of growth mindset and bilingual cognitive flexibility? Method \u2014 Mixed method designs. Tools include: SPSS, experimental designs. Please s ee \"Student Roles\" for more information. Expectations - Mentees should be excited to share their own expertise and apply their on- training. I expect mentees to have an 'evolutionary approach' to their experiences in my lab and be excited to learn and contr ibuted to their own research training. Student Roles \u2014 All students (regardless of school year) will have an opportunity to participate in all aspects of the research process, including literature review (e.g. how to identify relevant articles and summarize findings), experimental design and stimuli creation (e.g. collaborative discussion of experimentation methodology), working with participants (e.g. how to recruit participants, obtaining consent, executing research protocols), and coding/SPSS ana lysis (e.g. how to transcribe, code, and analyze data). All language group performances are coded for success on each task within each experiment.

Title of Research Pro ject \u2014 Social Experiences and Relationships on Cross- Cultural Health (SEARCH) Purpose and background \u2014 Social relationships have a powerful effect on well -being, such that supportive experiences can get \"under the skin\" to affect physical health outcomes ( Guan, Bower, Almeida, Cole, Dahl, Irwin, Seeman, & Fuligni, 2016). Positive social relationships may affect health by buffering against the negative effect of stress on physiological, stress- response systems (e.g., neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, immune). However, individuals from different cultural backgrounds may have different support needs and norms (Guan & Fuligni, 2015). Research Questions or Hypothesis \u2014 The study examines how receiving and providing social support affects stress reduction among young adults from diverse backgrounds within an experimental paradigm. Method \u2014 We use primary quantitative methods. Within the experimental design, we collect survey, behavioral, and physiological data. Student Roles \u2014 Students have opportunities to be involved in many various steps of the scientific method -- from reviewing literature, designing a study, analyzing data, writing up the results in an APA -formatted presentation or manuscript. Expectations \u2014 My research assistants meet with me regularly. They learn to collect, analyze, and interpret empirical data. They practice the craft of research methods in developmental psychology. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 Western Psychological Association (WPA), American Psych ological Association (APA) Publications \u2014 Please check out my faculty page for more publications. Updated: March 2021 Page 5 of 76 Rika Meyer Mentor Bio - Dr. Meyer received her BA in Psychology at UCLA and her MA and PhD in Developmental Psychology at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Her research interests include health, chronic pain, trauma, and stress in children, adolescents, and their families. She explores ways to pr omote academic success and well -being from childhood to emerging adulthood. Title of Research Project - Trauma and Mindfulness Study conducted by the Child and Adolescent Trauma, Chronic Pain, and Health (CATCH) Lab in collaboration with Children's Hospita l Los Angeles (CHLA) Background & Purpose - Children and adolescents who have been exposed to multiple Adverse Childhood Experiences (e.g., child abuse, domestic violence, alcoholic parents) are at risk for developing a number of negative outcomes such as suicidality (Dube, Anda, Felitti, Chapman, Williamson, & Giles, 2001), violent behavior (Duke, Pettingell, McMorris, & Borowsky, 2010), and other negative mental health outcomes (Chapman, Dube, & Anda, 2007). Mindfulness has been shown to be an effective intervention for adolescents who are under stress (Biegel, Brown, Shapiro, & Schubert, 2009; Brown, West, Loverich, 2011; art, Johnson, Magyari, & Ellen, 2011; White, 2012). However, there is currently limited amount of studies that have rigorously examined the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions on children and adolescents with significant traumatic experiences, like child abuse. Therefore, the current study will examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention with children and adolescents who have experienced trauma and a high number of ACEs. Research Aims - The current study will employ a Randomized Control Tr ial comparing two treatment groups: 1) Treatment as Usual (TAU) and 2) Mindfulness Mobile Application + TAU. Standardized measures and qualitative open -ended questions will be collected weekly to determine the comparative effectiveness of the treatment gro ups. Method - Quantitative (Surveys); SPSS Student Roles - Students will complete a variety of research tasks to build their skills by: 1) Conducting literature reviews, 2) Leading data collection (e.g., conducting consent conferences, administering survey s), 3) Taking part in Data Entry, Cleaning and Analysis, 4) Developing individual and group research projects, and 5) Presenting data findings at conferences and assisting with write -ups of publications. Expectations - Mentees in this lab should: Have experience working with children and adolescents; Have experience with data entry in SPSS; Be passionate about learning research processes; Work well in a group setting; Be respectful, punctual, and accountable. I strive for all my mentoring relationships to be a positive and productive learning experience. Therefore, we will check in weekly to make sure that tasks are being completed, but also to make sure that students are getting what they need out of the experience. I work to maintain a comfortable environm ent where mentees feel at home, foster new academic and professional connections, and build their skills in a supportive atmosphere.

April Taylor ** NOT ACCEPTING NEW MENTEES FOR 2021 -2022** Mentor Bio \u2014 Ph.D. 2001, University of California Los Angeles. B.A. 1993, Pomona College Purpose & Background \u2014 Motivational researchers have consistently documented that as students move into middle school many experience a decline in academic achievement and orientation towards school. This is particularly the case for ethnic- minorities who experience disproportionate declines in academic indicators compared to their non- ethnic minority counterparts. Updated: March 2021 Page 7 of 76 Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 Guided by the expectancy -value framework this work examines 1) perceptions of barriers and achievement values as mediators for the relationship between experiences with discrimination and academic outcomes, and 2) how this mediational model may be moderated by ethnicity. Method \u2014 Analyses will include sociometric and nonparametric analyses, multilevel regressions, and multivariat e analyses of variance. Student Roles \u2014 Undergraduates will participate in recruitment, data collection, analysis, reporting, and presentation Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences Vickie Yu Purpose & Background \u2014 The way in which speech sounds are perceived and produced depends on the nature of individual's language experience. My study aims to investigate the acoustic aspect of the speech features in second language (L2) learners of English to better understand how the different phonetic components between their native language and English affect their speech production in English. The findings would provide useful reference for improving efficacy on pronunciation enhancement in the clinic and ESL settings. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 1) What phonetic components affect speech intelligibility in speakers who learn English as a second language? 2) What is the relation between the English speech production and perception patt erns in L2 learners of English? Method \u2014 This study will in volve both auditory perception and speech production tasks. L2 adult learners will complete both tasks. Native English speakers will be also recruited as control. Participants' language background infor mation will also be collected. The analysis of this st udy will involve acoustic analysis on vowels and consonants and s peech intelligibility measures. Student Roles \u2014 Students involved in this study will engage in different types of research activities in line with the progress of the project. The students wi ll learn how to: Conduct literature review (i.e., what to look for in a research article to help them understand and think beyond the article and summarize findings), Understand the process of designing experimental tasks, Conduct data collection (e.g., ho w to recruit participants, obtaining consent, executing research protocols), Perform data analysis (e.g., transfer/backup data, code, and analyze data), Present/Report the results (e.g., learn how to make interpretations based on the results and to relate the current findings to evidence in the literature, how to write a summary of the findings and how to make a scient ific research presentation). Expectations \u2014 Prior knowledge of phonetics is recommended, though all applicants will be considered. The students in this study will receive an intensive training on acoustic analysis for speech sounds (consonants and vowels) using an acoustic tool. Students will be encouraged to create a research project, collect data and present their studies as a poster a t the c onference.

Title of Research Project \u2014 Black Birth Equity Workers: Glowing Through Covid -19 Title of Lab \u2014 Health Opportunities M -health Mamas Equity Background & Purpose \u2014 In the US, burnout among birth equity workers (e.g., peer counselors, ch ildbirth doulas, pregnancy program facilitators is high. This burnout may be exacerbated for birth equity workers that work with black mothers and infants who experience disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality compared to their counterparts. Spec ifically, structural and interpersonal racism and discrimination underlie much of the physical and mental health risk Updated: March 2021 Page 12 of 76 for black, pregnant persons and their newborns. Though research shows that positive birthing outcomes are associated with doula -assisted b irths, birth equity workers such as doulas (non- clinical paraprofessionals that provide informational, emotional, and physical support for pregnant and postpartum families) during the COVID -19 pandemic are not considered essential workers and are not under the same protections as those implemented for hospital staff; yet continue to service their pregnant and postpartum clients. The purpose of the current study is to determine the effects of physiological stress (salivary cortisol, salivary alpha -amylase (sAA), salivary uric (sUA)) on risk of burnout and wellbeing among doulas. Research Questions or Hypothesis Doulas who 1) are black and 2) have primarily black clients will have higher salivary cortisol, sAA, and sUA compared to their counterparts. There will be an interaction between the doula race and client race. Method \u2014 Data are collected via self -reported surveys, anthropometrics (e.g., blood pressure), physiological measures from biospecimens (e.g., saliva), a nd open- ended questions. Student Roles \u2014 Assisting in the field work (working with participants virtually), conducting literature reviews, data management and cleaning, developing research protocols, designing secondary research questions, analyzing data, and drafting results for conferences (local, state, national). Mentees will have opportunities to virtually attend local maternal and infant health meetings with Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, Department of Mental Health, community- based organizations, and medical and mental health professionals. Expectations \u2014 Mentees will be expected to be committed, problem -solvers, think outside of the box, and passionate about health equity. They will be able to identify how research skills are tran sferable in different career paths and how they can make the research relatable. As a mentor, I will provide environmental, current, and historical context to the research and an opportunity to excel in the research field for emerging investigators.

He has produced a video featuring a Mexican -American patient at the end stage of Alzheimer's, along with her primary careg iver, husband, and hospice interdisciplinary team. Appointed as a 2018 CSUN Research Fellow, he has been able to devote his time to disseminating the video to clinics and hospitals in predominantly Latino communities in Southern California to support timel y referrals to hospice (the video can was selected as a health disparities scholar at NIH in 2013. He served as a consultant for the Illinois Department of Public Health from 2002 to 2009, helping to amend Certificate of Need program regulating new healthcare services and facility construction, generating $1 million in research grants. He has published more than 30 peer -reviewed j ournal articles and given more than 60 presentations. One of his recent papers was cited in a Washington Post article (\"Terminal neglect? How some hospices decline to treat the dying\" May 3, 2014). He is working on three projects: 1) looking at state polic ies on hospice providers; 2) analyzing the cancer (SEER) -Medicare joint dataset to investigate the reasons underlying live hospice discharge; and 3) promoting the awareness of hospice care among the Hispanic population. Ph.D. 1999, University of Illinois a t Chicago M.S. 1991, Wayne State University B.S. 1986, Chonnam National University Background & Purpose \u2014 Racial difference in healthcare use pattern is well documented: Minorities are less likely than their white counterparts to use preventive and primary care and more likely to use aggressive inpatient care at the end of life. My recent research has been focused on barriers for Latinos to the use of end of life care options including hospice care. In particular, I look for explanations for low hospice use among beneficiaries of In -Home Support Service (IHSS) program. IHSS is the largest long -term care program with nearly 50,000 low -income individuals with disabilities and another 50,000 caregivers. Half of the caregivers are beneficiaries' own family members who are paid for their care services. Updated: March 2021 Page 13 of 76 Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 Latino IHSS beneficiaries who died without hospice did so 1) because they were mistaken that they would lose IHSS benefit if they enrolled in hospice; 2) because they were not a ware of hospice availability; 3) because they wer e concerned about hospice cost. Method \u2014 Focus group meetings and telephone/in- person interview targeting (1) IHSS caregivers; (2) hospice workers; (3) hospital discharge planners. Data will be analyzed thro ugh qualitative analysis of interviews using Nvivo Student Roles \u2014 Conduct Literature review. Develop a survey questionnaire, Conduct a focus group meeting/phone/in- person interview. Analyze qualitative data collected and identify themes. Write a method/result section for a journal manuscript. Write an abstract to submit for a conference. Expectations \u2014 Students will gain: (1) Opportunities to present/publish research findings at nat ional level conference/journals. (2) A promising career in long- term care research and policy as the old population rapidly incr eases over the next two decades. (3) A n experience with various research methods \u2014for example, students from the CTVA and Journalism departments recently collaborated with me to produce a video featuring a Mexican -American patient at the end stage of Alzheimer's, along with her primary caregiver, husband, and hospice interdisciplinary team.

Bobbie Emetu Mentor Bio \u2014 Dr. Bobbie Emetu's research focus is in sexual transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Her research interests include condom use errors, innovative methods for STI testing, HIV -related stigma, and the association between sexual abuse and sexual risk behav iors. She continues to conduct applied research within the areas of health education, disease prevention, and sexual health. Ph.D. 2014, Indiana University M.P.H 2014, Indiana University M.L.S 2009, University of Wisconsin B.S. 2007, Middle Tennessee State University. Background & Purpose \u2014 Research conducted on male sexual minorities are limited to disease or sexual behavior, even though the definition of sexual health incorporates other dimensions. The aim of this study was to examine the physical, emotional, and mental sexual health components of young men who have sex with men (YMSM) with a previous history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). The data was collected in the Midwest. Participants had to be a male, ages of 18 -29, with a history of CSA, and currently engaging in same -sex behaviors. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 1. What is the meaning of other sexual health components such as physical, emotional, and mental sexual health to YMSM who have experienced CSA? 2. What are the perceived risk factors related to the physical, emotional, and mental components of sexual health among YMSM with CSA histories? Method \u2014 Phenomenology is both a conceptual framework and a methodology (Marton, 1986; Moustakas, 1994). Semi - structured interviews are the p rimary method of data collection for phenomenological studies (Creswell, 2012; Merriam, 2002). The interview guide consisted of questions that covered the comprehensive components of sexual health. During the interview, notes were taken and an audio record er was utilized to assure accuracy of interview responses. The face- to-face interviews lasted approximately an hour. Sixteen (N=16) interviews were conducted. The data collection and transcription are completed for this study. The data will be analyzed and prepared for two journal submissions through the context of the physical, emotional, and mental components of sexual health. A semiotic phenomenological procedure will be used for analyzing the data. The semiotic procedure is the methodological schema of description -reduction- interpretation (Merriam, 2002). As part of thematic and content analysis to develop independent themes, preliminarily themes will be further analyzed by the utilization of NVivo (qualitative data analysis software). The first manuscri pt will focus on the physical components of sexual health, and the second manuscript will highlight the emotional and mental components of sexual health among the participants of this study. Updated: March 2021 Page 14 of 76 Student Roles \u2014 The assistance of one student is needed for this project. Regardless of college level, the selected student will be trained by the researcher on qualitative methods and analysis, including NVivo (qualitative data analysis software). Then, the selected student along with the researcher will analyze the d ata separately, and afterwards will compare results. The researcher and student will reanalysis the data using NVivo. After the thematic analysis, the student will assist with th e manuscript development. Expectations \u2014 This project will provide an opportunity for a student to become familiar with qualitative methods and manuscript development. Also, the student could potentially be included in a publication and an opportunity to attend and present at a conference Conferences Typically Attended \u2014American Pub lic Health Association; American Association of Behavioral and Social Sciences; Ethnographic and Qualitative Research; Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality; Society of Public Health Education Claudia Toledo -Corral Mentor Bio - Claudia Toledo- Corral is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Health Sciences at CSUN and an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the University of Southern California (USC). Dr. Toledo -Corral has a background in biological sciences, health psychology, and anthro pology/cultural studies, and obtained her M.P.H. and Ph.D. in Preventive Medicine from USC. She has a long -standing research agenda in the field of obesity and associated disease risk in minority populations. Dr. Toledo- Corral's past work includes the stud y of the biological underpinnings of pediatric obesity and diabetes risk, assessing the efficacy of clinical diagnostic methods of diabetes, and examining the physiological role of stress on obesity and cardiometabolic risk. Title of Research Project - Met abolism and Stress Assessment (MeSA) pilot study Background & Purpose - Everyday life stressors and community level burdens have been shown to alter brain biology. Psychoendocrinology literature shows compelling evidence that stress- induced changes to the body may contribute to obesity and metabolic diseases. Specifically, psychosocial and environmental stressors can disrupt hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis activity, which in turn will alter cortisol levels throughout the day. Disrupted cortisol pa tterns have been shown to be associated with increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Work in this area of research has implications for public health and health care practitioners by raising awareness of health risks associated with stress and the need for stress- reduction programs and interventions. Research Questions or Hypothesis - The overarching research aim of the MeSA pilot study to understand the complex relationship between various stressors, HPA -axis activity, and body fat. In this effort, we will characterize perceived, community, and biological stress and assess their relationships with body fat measures. Method - Since our lab is grounded in clinical epidemiological design, we only use quantitative methods. Our data are collected via sel f-reported surveys, health behavior assessments, and physiological measures from biospecimens. Student Roles - Depending on the stage of the research project, students may participant in a variety of tasks including: assisting in the field research (workin g directly with the participants), conducting literature reviews, data management and cleaning, designing secondary research questions, analyzing data and writing up results for local and possibility national level conferences. During the period of the Cov id-19 pandemic, student roles will be limited to remote work only. This includes mostly statistical analyses, extensive literature reviews, and writing up data reports. Expectations - Enthusiasm, commitment, and an open mind are three key expectations of potential mentees. As a mentor, I strive to provide context to the research environment and opportunity to excel in the research field for young investigator s.

Title of Research Project \u2014 Behaviors that Influence the Health of College Students Purpose & Background \u2014 College is a critical period of transition when students must balance the demands of obtaining a college degree while adapting to their increasing autonomy and responsibility. Research suggests that college students are an especially vulnerable subset of the population for risky behaviors, such as substance use and misuse. These types of behaviors can threaten students' ability to su ccessfully navigate challenges faced in college and can have lasting implications for future employment and health. Research Question \u2014 Do CSUN students have a high prevalence of risky behaviors (such as substance abuse)? Method \u2014 Data from the American College Health Association - National College Health Assessment (a nationally recognized research survey that is conducted at CSUN periodically and provides precise data about students' health habits, behaviors, and perceptions) will be analyzed.

Department of Kinesiology Sean Flanagan Mentor Bio \u2014 Sean P. Flanagan received a B.S. degree in Exercise Science (emphasis in Athletic Training) from Penn State University, an M.S. in Exercise and Sport Science (emphasis in Exercise Physiology) from the University of Dayton, and a Ph.D. in Biokinesiology (emphasis in Biomechanics) from the University of Southern California. He is certified as an Athletic Trainer (NATA), Strength and Conditioning Specialist (NSCA), and Exercise Physiologist (American College of Sports Medicine). Ph.D. 2004, University of So uthern California M.S. 2000, University of Dayton B.S. 1990, Pennsylvania State University Background & Purpose \u2014 The main purpose of my research is to understand how the various joints of the body work together as an integrated chain. I am particularly interested in how these joints must work together to maintain a healthy and robust locomotor system, and how impairment at one joint may lead to compensatory motion and/or injury at another. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 Which joint motions and torques are necessary for a given task? How do the joints involved in the movement compensate for one another? What are the implications of these compensations? Method \u2014 1) simple models of kinematic chains; 2) experiments; and 3) complex musculoskeletal model s. I use simple models to uncover fundamental principles of multi -joint movement, which are then tested via experiments with human subjects. Some of the experiments involve quantifying coordination and compensation amongst different joints during fundament al movement patterns, while others involve creating an artificial impairment (such as a decrease in strength, range of motion, etc.) and examining the consequences of that impairment. Experiments make use motion capture and force platforms to conduct 3- D analysis of a movement. Since there is a limitation to the extent in which you can create an artificial impairment on people, the next step is to use complex musculoskeletal models to examine the role of an impairment and/or compensatory motion in producing injury. Students work with several types of data, including: motion capture, inverse dynamics, computer simulation, electromyography, and strength and range of motion assessments. Student Roles \u2014 Students are gradually responsible for data collection and computer modeling techniques (sophomore/junior/senior), hypothesis generation and testing (junior/senior), experimental design (junior/senior), and teaching less experienced students (junior/senior). Additionally, seniors have the opportunity to conduct an independent investigation of their own design. Students gain skills that are applicable to research in such diverse fields as biomechanics, motor control, orthopedics, and biomedical engineering. Expectations \u2014 I like to tailor lab experiences to individu al student interests, and hope that by doing so we can learn together and from each other in a dynamic and fun environment. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 Typical conferences I attend include: American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), American Society of Biomechanics (ASB), National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA), and National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA). Updated: March 2021 Page 17 of 76 Danielle Jarvis Mentor Bio - Dr. Jarvis is the director of LEAAP, the Laboratory for Evaluating Athletic & Aesthetic Perform ance. She teaches courses in biomechanics, dance, research methods, and athletic training. Her research interests are in movement coordination during skilled activities. She also regularly choreographs and performs with the Los Angeles -based dance company LA Unbound, and she is an avid football and hockey fan. Background & Purpose - My work investigates the strategies underlying complex movement patterns and compensations in movement patterns that may contribute to or result from injuries. Research Questions or Hypothesis - Some projects I am currently working on include: (1) Determining the effects of different footwear on jumping performance in dancers, as measured by lower extremity joint motion (kinematics) and joint forces (kinetics) (2) Examini ng the differences in movement and coordination patterns during gross motor skills performed by college students with and without Autism Spectrum Disorders (3) Comparing measurement of joint motion using traditional 3D motion capture and portable inertial sensors (4) Comparing the differences in lower extremity dynamics during walking, running, and jumping when using different methods of marking and tracking the foot. Method - My research uses a computer aided video motion analysis system and force plates to collect data regarding kinematics and kinetics. Markers are placed on subjects and video data is collected as movements are performed. Software is then used to process the data and draw conclusions about motion and forces, particularly at lower extremit y joints such as the hip, knee, ankle, and toes. I am also implementing a portable inertial sensor -based system to collect similar data outside of a laboratory setting, in a gymnasium, dance studio, or outdoors. Student Roles - Students will learn how to collect biomechanical data, process the data using specialized software programs, and analyze and interpret the results. Software programs used include Cortex (Motion Analysis), Visual3D (C - Motion), MATLAB (Mathworks), and SPSS. Expectations - Students wil l be exposed to the entire research process, including the presentation of the results in the forms of posters, presentations, and publications. Seniors will also have the opportunity to develop and investigate their own biomechanical research question. I work closely with mentees early on and am looking for students who are interested in taking on more independent projects as they gain the skills to investigate questions. I enjoy spending time in the lab with students and try to create an open, welcoming s pace for all!

Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation, 12, 314- 3 Updated: March 2021 Page 21 of 76 College of Social & Behavioral Sciences Department of Africana Studies Aimee Glocke Mentor Bio \u2014 Dr. Aimee Glocke is a Professor of Africana Studies at CSUN. Her education includes: B.A. in English, Sociology, and Racial and Ethnic Studies from the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse. M.A. in Afro -American Studies from UCLA. Ph.D. in African American Studies from Temple University. Her research interests include African/Black Literature, African/Black History, African/Black Dance, African/Black Psychology . Background & Purpose \u2014 Although there has been research published on how Bla ck Studies (i.e. Black History) positively affects Black students in K -12 (Banks, 1969; Hare, 1969; Roth, 1969; Adams, 1970), most of the studies have focused on the affect Black Studies has on university students (Black and Non Black) because that is wher e Black Studies is most pervasive (Clements, Jr., 1970; Carey and Allen, 1977; Johnson, 1984; Livingston et al, 2010). However, little research has been published on teaching Black Science in grades K -12 or, more specifically, on teaching Black Science in an African Centered Way to Black and Non Black (i.e. Asian, Latino/Chicano, American Indian, European, etc.) K -12 students. Therefore, this project will help to fulfill the original mission of Black Studies by training BUILD students to use their background and experience in science (i.e. Psychology, Sociology, Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Physics, etc.) to teach African Centered lessons on Black Science in grades K-12 in order to increase the students' cultural consciousness, cultural awareness, and c ultural identity. Research Question or Hypothesis \u2014 How does learning about Black Studies, or more specifically Black Science, in an African Centered Way, in grades K -12, increase not only Black students' cultural consciousness, cultural awareness, and cultural identity; but, all students'? Method \u2014 Contact the principals of K -12 schools near CSUN with a significant Black and Non- Black student population and offer to teach lessons in Black Science. Meet with the teachers to discuss ideas for lessons; have BUILD students research, design, and teach the lessons to the K -12 students; test the results using mixed methods; analyze the results to confirm if the research supports our hypothesis that learning about Black Science in an African Centered Way increases the cultural consciousness, cultural awarene ss, and cultural identity of both Black students and Non Black students. We will use mixed methods, both qualitative and quantitative, to measure the results including surveys of the K -12 students (pre and post the lessons); observations of the K -12 stude nts during the lessons; and interviews after the lesson(s) with the K -12 students, teachers, parents, principals, and BUILD students. Student Roles Sophomores and Juniors \u2014 Learn African Centered Pedagogy; conduct research on Black Science topics; develop age appropriate/African Centered lesson plans; teach lessons under student/faculty supervision; learn quantitative and qualitative research design and analysis to assist with surveys and observations. Seniors \u2014 Additionally: review and offer feedback on the lesson plans of the younger students; teach lessons without faculty supervision; help design the survey; analyze survey data; observe students during lessons; analyze observation data; assist in interviews with K -12 students, teachers, parents, principal s, and BUILD students; analyze interview data. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 Conferences usually attended: National Council for Black Studies (NCBS), African Heritage Studies Association (AHSA), National Association of African American Studies (NAAS). Publications \u2014 View select publications & presentations Updated: March 2021 Page 22 of 76 Department of Anthropology Chin -Hsin Liu ** NOT ACCEPTING NEW MENTEES FOR 2021 -2022 ** Mentor Bio \u2014 I am a biological anthropologist specialized in bioarchaeology- the study of human skeletal remains from archaeological context. Paleodietary reconstruction using stable isotope analysis and paleopathology are my main methods. Key geographic foci are Southeast Asia (Thailand, Philippines) , East Asia (Taiwan), and West Mexico (project in development). Ph.D. 2012, University of Florida M.A. 2005, University of Florida B.A. 2002, National Taiwan University Background & Purpose \u2014 Bioarchaeology is the study of human skeletal remains in archaeological context. By observing skeletal and dental pathologies and reconstructing dietary patterns, human skeleton can inform us about past life history, community organization, movement, identity, social structure, and environmental change, just to name a few. These topics are relevant to our current societal discourse as we face impacts of globalization, migration, and climate change. Keywords: Archaeology, human skeleton, bone chemistry, paleopathology, he alth, prehistory Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 This project aims to explore issues of skeletal health disparity, recourse procurement, migration pattern, and regional interaction of the people once lived during the Post -classic period in modern day West Mexico. This area was a key corridor of interaction in terms of material trade, ideology, and biological admixture both before and after the abandonment of major Maya cities (Post -classic Maya). Despite being at the crossroads of cultural and biologic al exchange between North and Central America, this area has received relatively less scholarly attention, especially in bioarchaeology, than other Maya and peripheral sites. Method \u2014 These research interests will be addressed by analyzing the human skelet al remains excavated from five archaeological sites in West Mexico. The collection is currently curated in the Fowler Museum (UCLA). The analytic process has three phases, with heavy involvement of scientific methods and medical concepts. An inventory of t he remains will first be conducted by identifying and recording the skeletal elements available and their state of preservation. Macroscopic observation of paleopathology and health markers (e.g., trauma, congenital abnormalities, development/nutritional s tress markers, infectious diseases, etc.) will follow. Microscopic and histological studies will be conducted to enhance differential diagnosis when warranted. The third phase will involve sample selection and laboratory work to extract collagen and purify hydroxyapatite for stable isotope analysis in the mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses will be performed a fter viable data are collected. Student Roles \u2014 Students have the opportunity to assist in conducting literature research to understand geographic and temporal context of the sites. I will provide training on handling human skeletal remains and laboratory safety before helping with inventory, paleopathological observation, and bone chemistry lab work. Students will learn how to estimate sex and age of a skeletal individual, identify pathology and health markers, and perform basic statistical analyses. Students will also participate in the preparation of manuscripts for publication and have opportunities to present in conferences Expectations \u2014 I welc ome students who are motivated, disciplined, and responsible. Students must be able to follow directions well and are expected to behave professionally when conducting research on human skeletal remains. Students with backgrounds in anthropology, biology, museum studies, or Central American history and culture are preferred but not required. Students who are interested in pursuing higher degrees or careers in anthropology, museum curation and management, forensic sciences, criminal justice, biochemistry, an d medical professions are highly encouraged to participate in this project. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 Western Bioarchaeology Group Meeting, Annual Meeting of Paleopathology Association, Society for American Archaeology, and American Association of P hysical Anthropologists (particularly in the Unde rgraduate Research Symposium). Updated: March 2021 Page 23 of 76 Department of Geography Luke Drake Mentor Bio \u2014 To date, I have conducted research at neighborhood, urban, and national scales through studies in Florida, New Jersey, California, and through a U.S. and Canada national survey. Current projects are located in Southern California and the South Pacific country of Vanuatu. Ph.D. 2015, The State University of New Jersey , M.A. 2010, University of Miami , B.S. 2002, University of North Carolina Title of Research Project \u2014 My research contributes to CSUN BUILD PODER objectives through theoretically -informed and empirically -grounded investigation of urban food systems. Food access and nutrition are two issues that are underscored by geographical disparities. Interventions often include gardens and farmers' markets, whose health benefits have been noted through inter - disciplinary research. However, relatively little knowledge about the geographies in which these interventions are pr oposed and carried out. Background & Purpose \u2014 My research aims to create knowledge on 1) which places should be targeted for interventions such as gardens and markets; 2) how and why these interventions serve the neighborhoods they are intended to serve, and 3) the processes through which garden and markets succeed or fail to deliver health outcomes. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 What are the spatial patterns of food access and distribution that may lead to uneven health outcomes? Where are farmers' markets, gardens, and food retail located, and are they associated with demographic trends? Is the food distributed at the locations consumed by residents of those neighborhoods or elsewhere? Do urban residents acquire food from markets or gardens, and if so, where? Why and how do these spatial patterns form? Why do farmers choose certain farmers' markets over others? How do urban residents become involved in and sustain garden efforts? What processes lead to urban residents taking up or rejecting partici pation in food security interventions? Method \u2014 These research questions require the use of mixed methods. My research has employed qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, participant observation, focus groups, archival research, surveys, spatial statistics, and geographic information systems (GIS). Primary data collection through fieldwork, as well as secondary data collection from federal, state, and local sources is used. I have also developed and used web- based mobile mapping a nd GIS applications. Analytical methods include the identification of themes from coded qualitative data through NVivo software, discourse analysis of archival materials, spatial statistics in GIS and SPSS software. Since my research draws on multiple epis temologies and not just mixed methods, analysis with rely in some cases on statistical significance through large sample size and in others on analytical generalization through the small sample size and context provided by case studies. Student Roles \u2014 Data collection opportunities for students include the selection and pre -processing of secondary datasets using Microsoft Excel and ArcGlS; fieldwork to collect location and attribute data on urban food systems; advanced students can also assist in the collection of qualitative data through interviews and observations. Data analysis opportunities include the processing and management of data; tabulation of descriptive and inferential statistics using Excel, SPSS, and ArcGlS; transcription and coding of qualit ative data using NVivo. Advanced students can assist in many -to-many database design and management, web programming, advanced GIS analysis and modeling, cartography in Adobe Illustrator, and the design and maintenance of web -based data tools such as ArcGlS Online and ArcGlS Collector. Expectations \u2014 This research should be of interest to students interested in the intersection of health and related topics such as urbanization, sustainability, environmental justice, and economy. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 California Geographical Society; Association of Pacific Coast Geographers; American Association of Geographers . Updated: March 2021 Page 24 of 76 Edward Jackiewicz Mentor Bio \u2014 Research interests include Urban, Tourism, and Migration/Transnationalism. Ph.D. 1998, Indiana University, M.A. 1993, Temple University, B.S. 1983, Arizona State University Background & Purpose \u2014 My research is community -based examining the spatiality of health disparities in California, looking not only at racial and ethnic divides, but also socioeconomic and geographical (rural, suburban and urban). I am interested in the inequities in environmental exposure as well as how health services are accessed and delivered. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 Are certain diseases and healt h issues more prominent in certain locations? What are the barriers to a more equitable health system? Which groups are more prone to inferior health treatment? How has the Affordable Care Act altered previously existent health disparities? How can the healthcare experience for undocumented individuals be improved? Method \u2014 Research will be conducted using both existing (secondary) data and by gathering primary data through surveys as well as more in -depth interviews with various stakeholders as well as community members. Student Roles \u2014 Students can participate in this rese arch through various activities from the very early stages of a project such as reading relevant literature, writing literature reviews, designing surveys, manipulating and analyzing data, collecti ng data, mapping geographic phenomenon, and writing publishable articles. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 There are several conferences that I frequently attend, including: The Association of American Geographers (Spring), Association of Pacific Coast Geographers (Fall), California Geographical Society (Spring) , and the National Health Disparities Conference. Regan Maas Mentor Bio \u2014 Ph.D. 2010, University of California Los Angeles M.A. 2005, California State University Northridge B.S. 2001, Iowa State University B.S. 1998, University of Iowa Background & Purpose \u2014 My specific research area is focused within Minority Health Disparities (specifically Hispanic populations), emphasizing Spatial Demography, Urban Neighborhood Dynamics, and GIS applications. This research focuses on both compositional and contextual variables, including socioeconomic measures, health outcomes measures, as well as neighborhood contextual measures such as social networks, residential choice and mobility, and spatio -temporal activity space. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 My research projects test the idea of spatially segmented cultural adaptation as a framework for unraveling the spatial and cultural differences in health outcomes across Hispanic/Latino neighborhood contexts and its relationship to the 'Hispanic health paradox'. Method \u2014 Datasets include cutting -edge geospatial data. S patial and non- spatial statistical techniques as well as geographic information systems (GIS) . Student Roles \u2014 Students would be exposed to working with large datasets including work with cutting- edge geospatial data. Students would be responsible for collecting and analyzing data using both spatial and non- spatial statistical techniques as well as geographic information systems (GIS). Students would gain skills in data collection/manipulation, hypothe sis building, and data analysis for minority health disparities research through the lens of the geospatial sciences Updated: March 2021 Page 25 of 76 Department of Psychology Thomas Chan Mentor Bio - I was raised in a Chinese restaurant by immigrant parents and grandparents. I was always at the intersection between older adults, the community, and technology. My work reflects this intersection by finding ways to leverage community assets and technologies to enhance health and functioning for underserved aging adults and their fa milies. I received my Ph.D. in Positive Developmental Psychology from Claremont Graduate University \u2014where I learned the science of \"the good life.\" Then I have received funding from The National Institute of Health/National Institute on Aging to sponsor m y Postdoctoral Fellowship in Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Mental Health of Aging at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health \u2014where I honed my abilities to develop and evaluate engaging technologies to improve the health and well -being of at -risk aging adults and their families. Title of Research Project - The Positive Aging Research and Development (PAR -D Lab; www.par -d.com), develops and evaluates immersive technologies that aim to enhance health and well -being. We created the World's First Mag icLeap Augmented Reality marriage proposal (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5goSpBuwZY&t=). We are currently teaming with NASA, medical institutions, community organizations, and technology companies on augmented reality and artificial intelligent project s to improve health, functioning, and educational outcomes. Background & Purpose - Augmented reality (holograms) that are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are changing the way we live and go about our day \u2014accelerated by the global COVID -19 Pandemic. The mass of these technologies are designed for people who are privileged enough to afford them. The PAR -D Lab's focus is to flip the script on how these BLEEDING EDGE technologies are designed and developed by creating scalable win -win interventions bas ed on the needs of underserved aging adults and their families. Research Questions or Hypothesis - (a) How do we leverage augmented reality technologies to improve health and well - being of aging adults and their families? (b) How do we create physically an d cognitively engaging activities that boosts mental and functional health outcomes? (c) How do we develop augmented reality solutions to improve the quality of life of people who are suffering from cognitive impairments? (e.g., mild cognitive impairments, Alzheimer's Disease)? Method - I leverage a mixture of applied methodologies (e.g., qualitative, ethnographic, and quantitative methods, along with eye tracking) to answer research questions on user experience, psychological engagement, user buy -in, usabi lity, value, and effectiveness. I also use structural equation modeling and growth mixture modeling to explore mechanisms and subpopulations. Student Roles - Computer science students with experience in coding (e.g., C#, Unity, Java Script) will be trained to develop applications to improve health outcomes. Engineering students with experience with sensors will be trained to create scalable methods of early detection of diseases and disabilities. Psychology students with experience in research and statisti cs will be trained to evaluate community -based interventions and user experiences. Art and design students with experience in animation and special effects will be trained to design characters and animations for augmented reality and mobile platforms. Expectations - Must be able to work in a start -up-like environment \u2014fast -pace, many unknowns, open- minded, willing to learn anything \u2014and be passionate about the PAR -D Lab's mission to improve the lives of people who come from underserved communities.

Stefanie Drew ** NOT ACCEPTING NEW MENTEES FOR 2021 -2022** Mentor Bio - I received my doctorate from the University of California, Irvine in Cognitive Psychology. After getting my Ph.D., I completed post -doctoral work in a neuroimaging lab where I conducted neuroimaging research utilizing functional magnetic resonance imag ing (fMRI) of the human visual cortex. Subsequently, I completed a NIH funded post -doctoral position at Western University of Health Sciences College of Optometry, where I was trained in utilizing oculomotor measurements to examine symptoms of asthenopia, or visual discomfort. After this position, I was delighted to join the faculty at CSUN and now run the Visual Information Sciences and Neuroscience (V.I.S.N.) Lab in the Department of Psychology. I take great joy in teaching, mentoring students, playing video games and training in krav maga. Title of Research Project - An inter -disciplinary investigation of the impact of immersive virtual reality practice on visual abilities. Visual Information Sciences and Neuroscience (V.I.S.N.) Lab (check out the V.I.S.N. lab's website ). Background & Purpose - New virtual reality systems have recently emerged on the commercial market and are being used across a wide variety of disciplines, from job training to physical therapy, biological imaging to psychological therapy. However, little is known about the impact of these new systems on the user. We aim to examine the impact of these systems on the oculomotor and cognitive functions of the user before and after training in virtual environments. Research Questions or Hypothesis - We anticipate a greater negative impact on those trained in virtual reality environments compared to those trained in the real world. Method - We collect quantitative data and analyses o n a variety of measures. These include optometric measurements, eye tracking recordings, neuroimaging output, behavioral responses (i.e. reaction times) as well as self -report survey data. Student Roles - Students in my lab are trained on a variety of techniques that include optometric measurements, eye tracking and neuroimaging. Students will be involved in data collection and analysis, as well as dissemination though poster presentations and possibly manuscripts. Expectations - I am looking for students that are passionate about research and eager to learn and gain experience with neuroimaging, eye tracking or virtual reality. We have weekly lab meetings with my entire team in a collaborative environment where students work together on different project s. Students will have the opportunity to be involved in multiple projects as well as be the lead researcher on projects and design a study with me if they develop their own question of interest in one of our areas of research.

Her current passion is to study the development and prevention of behaviors like aggres sion and disruption in young childre n. Please check out her website . Title of Research Project \u2014 Strategies to prevent the development of severe problem behavior in children Updated: March 2021 Page 28 of 76 Background & Purpose \u2014 The purpose of this research is to design effective tools for the screening of emerging problem behavior and the prevention of severe problem behavior in young children with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 We hypothesize that paying close attention to the immediate consequences of problem behavior in young children will enhance early detection and prevention strategies. These tools ultimately will enhance the quality of life for children and fam ilies of many abilities and backgrounds. Method \u2014 Mixed method (primarily quantitative). Targeted skills will be assessed using direct observation and behavioral measurement systems. Specifically, students will observe children during arranged activities a nd will collect data on functional skills (e.g., communication, play) and problem behavior (e.g., aggression, disruption) using iTouches running ABC DataPro software. In addition, students will record measures of experimenter integrity to identify whether the intervention is being implemented as planned. Data will be analyzed using graphic display of behavior change over time and will be discussed during weekly lab meetings. Student Roles \u2014 All research occurs off site, at established community partnerships . Students will be responsible for traveling to the site of the research, fostering collaborations with the community partner, collecting and analyzing data, graphing results, and discussing data during weekly meetings. Students will gain experience in dir ect observation, behavioral measurement, single- subject experimental design, and visual analysis of data. Expectations \u2014 Students can expect to participate in all levels of my community -based action research. This includes assisting with the: design of the study, implementation of sessions with children, in- vivo and video data collection, data review and analysis, and dissemination (via posters and presentations at local, national, and perhaps international conferences).

Elise Fenn Mentor Bio \u2014 I am a cognitive psychologist and am interested in understanding cognitive mechanisms such as memory and decision -making, broadly. Specifically, I am interested in two main lines of research: (1) how the understanding of cognitive mechanisms can be applied towards improving the legal system (specifically investigative interviewing and detecting deception), and (2) investigating factors that bias judgments of truth when making truth judgments rapidly, such as in a social media environment. I received my PhD in 2015 from Claremont Graduate University. I have been working as a faculty member at California State University Northridge since 2015 teaching Cognitive Psychology of Memory at the graduate and undergraduate level, and Research Methods for Psychology. H ere is a link to my research gate profile page: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elise_Fenn . Project Title \u2014 Cognitive and Social Factors that Impact Truth Biases in a Social Media Environment Background & Purpose \u2014 Human make rapid judgments of truth daily, such as when scrolling through social media feeds. While these rapid judgments of truth may seem meaningless in the moment, the potential long -term consequences may impact meanin gful areas of life, from health choices, to political decisions, to understanding news headlines. During these rapid judgments, the availability of \"non -probative\" information can increase bias to believe the information is true. For example, a series of s tudies found that presenting a related, but uninformative photo (e.g., a photo of a turtle) alongside a trivia statement (\"turtles are deaf\") increased bias to believe that information was true. In this research project, we investigate whether the effect o f nonprobative information persists within a social media environment, and what cognitive mechanisms underlie this effect. Further, we examine methods for reducing the unintended influence of nonprobative information on truth biases. Research Question(s) o r Hypothesis \u2014 In this research project, I am interested in answering the question, \"What cognitive mechanisms underlie the effects of nonprobative information on truth biases in a social media environment?\" and \"What Updated: March 2021 Page 29 of 76 methods can be used to reduce the infl uence of nonprobative information on truth biases in a social media environment?\" A particular emphasis will be places on understanding the influence of nonprobative information in several applied areas, including: health behaviors, political beliefs, memory for news headlines, and jury decision -making. Method \u2014 This research is Quantitative. The method of data collection will most likely be designing an experiment via in-person and online methods. You may develop surveys and also design materials to be adm inistered on a computer screen via programs such as Inquisit or EPrime software. You may also analyze data using SPSS, Excel, or R software. Student Roles \u2014 Students will be responsible for conducting hypothesis -driven literature reviews, collecting data i n- person or online, designing and creating materials using computer software programs such as Qualtrics, Inquisit, or EPrime, analyzing data using SPSS, R, Excel software, presenting and disseminating data at regional or national conferences, and the oppor tunity to publish in peer -reviewed journals pending student contributions to the project. Expectations \u2014 I expect students to have an interest in understanding cognitive psychology, and experimental psychology. Student in lab will gain knowledge on all aspects of the research project, from project creation to project dissemination. I hope to provide students with a supportive lab environment and help them accomplish their goals of becoming psychological scientists. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 American Psychology -Law Society, Association for Psychological Science, Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition, Psychonomic Society, Western Psychological Association Publications \u2014 Please see my research page . Sun-Mee Kang Mentor Bio \u2014 I am a social and personality psychology with expertise on statistical data analyses and research methods. I have been mentoring students at UC Davis, University of Notre Dame, and CSUN for over 20 years. All of my research projects focus on the psychol ogical factors that contribute to social adaptation, including emotion, personality, social working memory, and acculturation strategy. Research Projects \u2014 Three projects are currently undergoing in my research lab. In these projects, my students and I explore fine -grained differences in the brain activities of individuals with depression, social anxiety, or antisocial personality traits when they process emotional information. Background & Purpose \u2014Negatively valenced information attracts more attention than positively or neutrally valenced information, and this greater sensitivity to negatively valenced information is referred to as the negativity bias. B y measuring the late positive potential (LPP), previous studies have reported that the LPP amplitude was much higher in the negative emotion condition compared to the other emotion conditions. The current projects are designed to explore whether individual s with certain psychological disorders would display the same negativity bias while they process emotion informational information using the Electroencephalogram (EEG). Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014Past research has demonstrated that individuals wit h high degrees of psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, or antisocial personality traits show an early processing deficit compared to individuals with low degrees of psychological disorders by focusing on P100 and P300 peaks in the Event - Related brain Potential patterns. However, few studies have explore a lack of the negativity bias using the LPP. The main purpose of the current study is to explore a moderating effect of the psychological disorders on the negativity bias. Based on previous r esearch, it is predicted that individuals with high degrees of the psychological disorders would not display the negativity bias compared to individuals in the comparison groups. Method \u2014 Quantitative method. We are using an experimental design. We presen t study stimuli on a computer monitor using E -prime (by Psychology Software Tools. This is a comprehensive software available for behavioral research) and record brain waves using Brainvision recorder while participants take computerized tests. Updated: March 2021 Page 30 of 76 Student Rol es \u2014 Students who are involved in these projects will receive comprehensive training to be a qualified research assistant including how to run an EEG study and analyze EEG data. They will also learn how to design a study using E -prime to develop study stim uli. Students will learn how to do a literature review and comprehend empirical papers by weekly lab meetings. They will learn how to write an abstract for presentation and how to present their studies at various conferences. They will be also invited to w rite a manuscript together for publication. Expectations \u2014 Our lab is looking for students with strong motivation, persistence, passion, and dependability, and maturity. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 Society for Neuroscience, Association for Psychological Science, American Psychological Association, Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Western Psychological Association Justin Kantner ** NOT ACCEPTING NEW MENTEES FOR 2021 -2022** Mentor Bio \u2014 Most of the decisions we make are based on some form of supporting evidence from memory, yet memory is notoriously faulty. My research examines the biases that help us come to decisions (often erroneously) when evidence from memory is incomplete. My focus is on recognition memory judgments, which entail a decision as to whether a presented stimulus was also encountered earlier in the experimental session (an \"old\" item) or was not encountered earlier (a \"new\" item). In a recognition memory task, participants may exhibit a bias to err on the side of \"old\" responses (a liberal bias), \"new\" responses (a conservative bias), or neither (a neutral bias). My research (Kantner & Lindsay, 2012, 2014) demonstrated that recognition bias is relatively stable within an individual and behaves like a cognitive trait, one with potentially broad significance for cognition and behavior. Ph.D. 2011, University of Victoria M.A. 2005, Indiana University B.A. 2000, Purdue University . Background & Purpose \u2014 A number of studies have examined the relationship of response bias to neural and behavioral pathologies, with strikingly consistent results: compared to appropriate controls, recognition criteria are more lax in elder ly individuals, patients with Alzheime r's disease, patients with dementia, patients with schizophrenia, individuals with mental retardation, and individuals with panic disorder. These findings strongly suggest that interventions aimed at improving decision making in these populations should focus on this lax tendency, which may indicate a degraded ability to engage top-down control mechanisms that normally keep individuals from making memory decisions based on weak evidence. Such individuals may adopt false beliefs (e.g., accepting false claims as true or false memories as accurate) that might be averted with the use of a stricter criterion when evaluating the evidence for those beliefs. Training in the use appropriate decision criteria does not require improvements in memory acuity per se (which may be difficult or impossible in some individuals) and could substantially improve decision making in individuals with these conditions. Such training may also be applied in the domains of eyewitness memory, medical diagnosis, security, and law enforcem ent, settings in which errors due to inappropriate decision criteria can carry disastrous consequences. Method \u2014 Two experiments will test the relationship between decision bias and false memories and false beliefs. Another will use a technique called \"con tent analysis\" to understand the rationale behind the decisions of lax versus strict recognizers. A fourth will test novel procedures for training decision bias when recognition decisions are extremely difficult. Student Roles \u2014 Students have the opportunity to assist in multiple experiments related to understanding decision bias and training it in memory impaired individuals. Students at any level can assist in all phases of the research, from experimental design and gathering of stimuli to running partic ipants in experiments, conducting descriptive and inferential data analyses using common statistical software packages, and, potentially, preparation of manuscripts and presentations at conferences such as the Psychonomic Society and Association for Psycho logical Science annual meetings. Updated: March 2021 Page 31 of 76 Ellie Kazemi Mentor Bio \u2014 I have been privileged to have the opportunity to mentor research assistants at my Ph.D. program at UCLA and as a faculty member in the Psychology department at CSUN for the past 14 years. I aspire to shape my incoming students into skilled scientists a nd effective team -players so that they can contribute in the ways they hope and become leaders. My mentoring style consist of a tiered mentorship model, which means senior researchers provide supervision, support, and training to new researchers. Title of Research Projects \u2014 Behavior Science and Technology Purpose & Background \u2014 Some of our projects are focused on how we can use technology (e.g., robotics, virtual reality, computer -based programs) to develop effective, efficient clinical training for careg ivers, teachers, therapists, and supervisors. We aim to develop high quality training materials to provide our learners hands -on experience, opportunities for practice and making mistakes in safe environments, and individualized timely feedback. For exampl e, we have used a humanoid robot to simulate a child with problem behaviors so that we can study how adults respond under such circumstances. That way, we can provide more effective trainings to such individuals so that they feel better equipped before wor king with real children. We often collaborate with community agencies (e.g., behavior analysis clinics, schools, fire department) for our projects. Currently, we have projects funded by NASA in collaboration with the Autonomy Research Center for STEAHM. Th is is a great opportunity for my mentees to collaborate with students from other departments and JPL scientists. Our research lab is very active. You can see our current members and work by going to our lab website. Research Question(s) or Hypotheses: Some questions we pose in our training research include: Can we use Artificial Intelligence to create real dynamic interactions in simulations to provide hands- on, safe training to practitioners? What is necessary for virtual reality training to go beyond incr easing test -scores and actually increase clinical skills? Why do some parents go back to their old ways of parenting instead of use the skills they learn in training? Does timing of feedback matter? Additionally, our projects funded by NASA look into: what are the strategies for increasing the number of robots a team of human operators can supervise at one time? How can behavior science help improve how autonomy researchers and engineers measure team performance and wor kload? Methods \u2014 We use mixed research designs including group and single -subjects. Most of our dependent variables involve direct observation and recording of data. Student Roles \u2014 Depending on your interests, we will involve you in all aspects of the research process. You will gain experience in developing technology- based trainings for our community partners, observing and recording behavioral data, conducting literary searches, designing studies and experiments, presenting posters or symposia at conferences, and much more! Expectations \u2014 I know that mentorship needs to be a two- way relationship to succeed. I encourage open communication and honesty from my mentees. I allow my mentees to help me guide them and work with me in reaching their goals. I strive to recruit those who are eager to learn, improve, and take advantage of opportunities. That is what makes regularly soliciting feedback from lab peers and myself such an integral part of our lab. Finally, we are a very family -oriented lab. In other words, we maintain a culture of kind, thoug htful, and caring behavior towards one another.

Updated: March 2021 Page 32 of 76 Debbie Ma Mentor Bio \u2014 My research focuses on stereotyping and prejudice. In my lab, we utilize implicit measures of stereotyping and prejudice to reveal unconscious biases that people may have. More recently, we have also been collaborating with Dr. Just Kantner's lab to explor e research surrounding racial categorization of racially ambiguous individuals, such as those who might be low in racial prototypicality or those who are biracial/multiracial. Title of Research Project \u2014 Stereotyping & Prejudice and Biracial Face Perceptio n Background & Purpose \u2014 The aim of our work is to better understand the conditions that promote bias, so that we can ultimately create interventions that might attenuate stereotyping and prejudice. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 What facial features correspond with accurate racial categorization? Why is it difficult for people to correctly categorize biracials as biracial? What are some individual differences that might moderate how a person racially categorizes others? Method \u2014 Q uantitative. In -lab experiments, online experiments. Student Roles \u2014 students can take on a host of responsibilities from data collection, analysis, writing up research, presenting posters, and in some cases coming up with novel research questions and co- authoring papers. Expectations \u2014 I expect lab members to be involved, reliable, and willing to learn. Students should be able to dedicate 5- 10 hours a week to data collection, lab meetings, and other lab- related projects.

Jonathan Martinez Mentor Bio \u2014 Ph.D ., 2013, UCLA (Clinical Psychology) M.A., 2009, UCLA (Clinical Psychology) M.A., 2007, SDSU (Psychology) B.A., 2002, UCI (Psychology) Purpose & Background \u2014 In child psychotherapy, parents' active participation in their child's mental health (MH) treatment is imperative, with children faring bett er when parents are actively engaged in treatment relative to individual child treatment (Dowell and Ogles 2010). Yet, when families - particularly those from ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged backgrounds - initiate services, they often experience significant barriers to therapy engagement (Kazdin, 1996). Knowledge and beliefs about MH problems and treatments, referred to as MH literacy , appear to be among the most common and explanatory barriers (Jorm, 2000). Thus, developing engagement strategies to target MH literacy gaps are needed. Psychoeducation, an evidenced - based practice used to present factual information about MH problems and treatments (Lukens & McFarlane, 2004), may be a successful strategy for targeting MH literacy barriers and engag ing families in care. The proposed research plan has an overall aim of developing and pilot Updated: March 2021 Page 33 of 76 testing a psychoeducation -based enhanced -intake procedure (PEP) for engaging families entering child MH services, with the followi ng specific aims and questions. Research Question(s) or Hypotheses \u2014 (Aim #1) Develop and refine the PEP in collaboration with community partners. Using a collaborative, iterative approach, feedback from community partners is expected to increase the validity, feasibility , and acceptabilit y of the PEP in usual care (UC) settings, and will answer the following: What difficulties do providers encounter in attempting to engage families in care, and what strategies are used? What are potential benefits/challenges to using PEP? (Aim #2) Examine the feasibility and acceptability of the PEP in a small -scale pilot study. The PEP will be evaluated for feasibility, fit, relevance, utility, and will be refined as needed for UC settings. This will answer the following: Do families and providers find the PEP beneficial in promoting family engagement? How can the PEP be modified to increase feasibility, helpfulness, and utility for engaging families, particularly ethnic minority families? (Aim #3) Implement the PEP in a pilot randomized trial. The feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of the PEP will be evaluated, as well as the comparative effectiveness of the PEP vs. UC. This randomized trial will answer the following: Does the PEP promote family engagement in care compared to UC? Are there specific su bgroups of families (ethnic minority status, SES, acculturation) that benefit more/less from the PEP? Student Roles \u2014 1) Observational coding of therapy session recordings. Students will be trained on a coding system to document therapist behaviors/strategies used to engage families, as well as parent/family behaviors that are indicative of engagement. 2) Semi -structured interviews with participants. Students will be trained on providing semi -structured interviews to participants to document participant perspectives on the PEP. 3) Focus groups with participants. Students will assist the focus group facilitator, and when effectively trained, lead their own focus group with participants. Expectations \u2014 Students will have the opportunity to participate in several facets of research, and will be integral to the success of this r esearch program. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 This research will give students the opportunity to present study findings at conferences, such as: American Psychological Association, Western Psychological Association, Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, and UCLA Psychology Undergraduate Research Conference.

Ph.D. 1997, University of California Santa Barbara M.A. 1994, University of California Santa Barbara B.A. 1992, California State University Chico. Background & Purpose \u2014 Jill Quilici studies the relationship between self -regulation and decision -making, focusing on developing and testing interventions to improv e self -regulation capabilities. Difficulties with self -regulation have been implicated in many health issues, particularly obes ity. This topic is of great significance because of the current obesity epidemic in the United States, which is associated with serious health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, and type II diabetes. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 Some questions her lab is exploring include: Is self -regulation a limited resource which can be depleted or are self -regulation failures due to changes in motivation and/or attention? How do we improve self-regulation capabilities? How do we manage decisio n-making when faced with conflicting goals (e.g., choosing what to eat when we want to eat healthy, but we also want to eat something very tasty)? Method \u2014 Most research studies in the lab use an experimental approach. A typical study might involve askin g participants to carry out a task which involves self -regulation (e.g., controlling emotional expression while watching an intense video or holding one's arm in icy water as long as possible). Then, some participants participate in an intervention designed to improve self -regulation, while other students (control group) do not. Finally, participants are asked to complete another self-regulation task (e.g., choosing between a healthy vs. unhealthy snack). If the intervention group outperforms the control group on the second self -regulation task, this would be evidence that the intervention is effective. Data analysis would be primarily quantitative \u2014usually involving analysis of variance or multiple regression. Student Roles \u2014 Students assisting in Dr. Quilic i's lab get experience conducting literature review, experimental design, development of stimulus materials, quantitative data collection, data scoring, data entry, data analysis, and writing up and presenting research findings. Students at the sophomore, junior, and senior levels can partici pate in all of these activities. Expectations \u2014 It is expected that students will become more independent as they progress in the lab and will take on more of a leadership role, eventually mentoring more junior student s. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 Dr. Quilici's lab presents at a variety of conferences, such as Western Psychological Association, Association for Psychological Science, Society for Behavioral Medicine, and Society for Personality and Social Psychology. Jill Razani Mentor Bio \u2014 Dr. Razani has worked with a number of NIH Fellowship students, such as those in MARC, RISE, and COR programs and will be happy to mentor students and/or faculty in the BUILD program. She is currently the chair of the psychology department. http://www.csun.edu/~ljr77544/ Research Projects \u2014 Dr. Jill Razani has two major research projects in the area of health disparities. The first study is to assess the relationship between neuropsychological test performance and everyday functional abilities of patients with early -stage dementia. The purpose of this study is to better characterize and find predictors of functional abilities of pati ents with dementia and those with mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, this study aims to better understand the relationship between patient functioning and caregiver burden. Updated: March 2021 Page 35 of 76 The second study in Dr. Razani's lab is designed to examine cultural and ac culturation factors that impact neuropsychological test performance of individuals from immigrant backgrounds. Factors such as bilingualism and level of acculturation are examined as they relate to neuropsychological performance in first, second and third generation immigrants. Method \u2014 We will assess these factors over a one- year period to understand the rate of decline in neuropsychological and daily functioning, as well as caregiver burden. Student Roles \u2014 Dr. Razani's lab has research assistants at all levels from freshmen to master's students. All students will learn the test battery for each project (i.e., the neuropsychological test battery) and those who master test administration, will be given the opportunity to administer the tests to research p articipants. All interested students will co -author a presentation to a regional scientific conference within their first year in the lab, and those students who continue in the l ab past one year, will most likely present at national and/or international scientific conference. Expectations \u2014 As students gain mastery in the lab, they will work more independently with scoring, data entry, data analysis, and dissemination of the findings (e.g., conference presentations or possibly journal publications).

My scholarship is largely guided b y the minors I completed in Education and Chicana/o studies. I was interested in research that could change the lives of other first -generation students. I then went on to complete my developmental psychology Ph.D. with an emphasis in cultural psychology a t the University of Santa Cruz, California. I am committed to social justice approaches in researching equity in technology contexts. My research approaches focus on an emerging approach known as Intersectional Tech that draws on equity and intersectional focused research approaches. My research tea m and I have recently focused on unlearning approaches that maintain the Updated: March 2021 Page 36 of 76 status quo and learn and implement critical and liberation psychology approaches at the theoretical and methodological level. These are popular methods used by community psychologists . Title of Research Project: Currently, there are two current strands of work I'm focusing on in my lab related to Intersectional Tech: 1. eSports and Video Games - In this line of work, I focus on issues related to equity in experiences during online ga ming. In my research, I have studied women's experiences with harassment during online gaming. My team and I are currently exploring how gender influences the perception of women's gaming abilities and gamer's views of racism in online gaming. I'm explorin g other future study areas, including understanding gaming culture norms and content analysis of the representation of different ethnic and gender groups in video games. 2. Social Justice Issues in University Education and STEM Careers - I am broadly inte rested in first -generation and minoritized students' experiences pursuing tech careers. My previous studies in these areas include: Latinas experiences as part of the tech workforce Mexican American children's engagement in programing Understanding how Latina/o students participate in class and seek help during office hours Interviews with Latinx and Armenian students on how they navigate institutional, family, cultural, and gender expectations and how this relates to mental health.

Background & Purpose \u2014 Caregiving is essential to maintaining close rel ationships, yet it also presents a range of potentially stressful experiences. Most research on caregiving focuses on what has traditionally been called \"burden\" or care that exceeds what caregivers think of as expected help. Yet, increasingly research sug gests that how individuals respond to the day- to- day perturbations they face creates the conditions for health or disease. My current work examines what strains and sustains caregivers through the inevitable unpredictability of caregiving, particularly car egiving during the earliest years when babies, toddlers, and preschool -age children are developing rapidly. To do so, I document daily living for caregivers of young children. The long- term goal is to link this understanding of day -to-day experiences with studies of health and stress. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 What are the day -to-day activities that sustain and/or strain caregivers? What are the values and ideals that underpin their caregiving? Do values and ideals lead caregivers to understand t heir daily experiences differently? Method \u2014 Central to my work is an in -depth semi -structured interview that asks caregivers to talk about their daily life: The Ecocultural Family Interview. I link that with a daily stress method: across 8 days, individuals provide saliva samples and wear an Apple Watch to assess their stress physiology on the same days that they complete a daily \"diary\" of stressful and positive experiences. Analytic process: Using a mixed -method approach, my team and I (a) categori ze caregivers according to how much love and affection are salient in their descriptions of their day- to-day life with children (b) conduct quantitative analyses of daily stressful and positive experiences, and (c) assay saliva for markers of stress (when funding is available). Student Roles \u2014 This research can't happen without a team of dedicated students. Students are involved in every step of the process, from interviewing to monitoring daily stress procedures to analysis and writing. Expectations \u2014 I seek students who are curious about cultural approaches and methods and looking to take advantage of the many resources I've developed to help them learn about quantitative and qualitative methods. Through weekly individual meetings, we'll work together to identify short -term and long -term projects that Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 Society for Research in Child Development, Child Care Policy Research Consortium, International Conference of Infant Studies, Research Conference on Early Childhood.

Yolanda Vasquez-Salgado ** NOT ACCEPTING NEW MENTEES FOR 2021-2022** Mentor Bio \u2014 I grew up in Oxnard, California, and I am proud to be a first -generation college student and daughter of immigrant parents from Mexico. I believe that my background and experiences continue to serve as a strength in my research inquiries of which I am very passionate. My program of research centers on investigating the role of sociocultural forces (i.e., sociodemographic, cultural mismatch) in underrepresented students' health and a cademic adjustment during the transition to college. I received my Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology, with a minor in Culture, Brain and Development, from the University of California, Los Angeles. I am also a proud graduate of the Bachelors and Masters pr ograms in Psychology at California State University, Northridge. Title of Research Project \u2014 Cultural Mismatch, Health and Academic Adjustment During the Transition to College Among Latinx Youth (Culture, Health and Development Laboratory) Culture, Healt h and Development Laboratory Website : https://chdlab.weebly.com Background and purpose \u2014 Cultural mismatch occurs when collectivism learned at home mismatches with the individualism of the university environment. In order to investigate this phenomenon, I have utilized a triangulation of methods (qualitative, survey, behavioral experiment). I have discovered that cultural mismatch varies in form (e.g. , family obligations -academic obligations, peer -peer), impacts health (mental, physical) and academics (inability to concentrate or study, poor grades) and is experienced by Latinx first -generation college youth as well as first -generation college students from diverse backgrounds. More recent pilot data that we have collected has revealed that cultural mismatch relates to biological and clinical markers of health (e.g., diurnal cortisol, body- mass -index). Research Questions: 1. What are the longitudinal trajectories of cultural mismatch over time? 2. Does cultural mismatch play a role in students' health (self -reported mental and physical health; biological and clinical markers of health) and academic adjustment outcomes over time? Updated: March 2021 Page 39 of 76 3. What is the larger mechanism involving associations between cultural mismatch, health and academic adjustment outcomes over time? 4. Are there resilience factors that protect students against cultural mismatch and its associations? Method \u2014 A longitudinal study will be employed. Across 3 separate time -points, Latinx freshmen will complete an online survey that assesses various types of cultural mismatch and health and academic adjustment outcomes, complete an at -home health activity that measures the stress hormone, cortisol, and take part in an in- person session where we will gather additional indicators of health (e.g., heart rate and blood pressure, body- mass- index). Analytic techniques include correlation, regression, mediation and profile ana lysis. There may also be opportunities to conduct more advanced statistical modeling. Student Collaborator Roles \u2014 Students will be expected to aid with literature reviews, as well as the collection, organization and processing of data. They will also lear n how to analyze and interpret data. There will be opportunities for students to present the results of the data in the form of an APA -formatted presentation or manuscript. Expectations \u2014 My office and lab are both located within close proximity in Lilac Hall; given their close proximity, I see my students on a frequent basis. Students in my lab receive a lot of training and mentoring. At the same time, students are expected to take the initiative to extend their knowledge base in theory and statistics by attending workshops and taking advanced courses as these experiences will aid them in making the most of their experience as emerging scholars in the field. It is also highly suggested for students to seek further opportunities for scholarships, awards and programs as these will further aid them in their development. Conferences \u2014 Potential conferences that we may attend are the Society for Research in Adolescence (SRA), Society for Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP), Society for the Study on Emerging Adulthood (SSEA) or the Society for the Psychological Study of Culture, Ethnicity and Race, Division of the American Psychological Association Department of Social Work Allen Lipscomb Mentor Bio \u2014I grew up in the San Fernando Valley and completed my K -12 grade education from LAUSD. Upon completing high school I attended Santa Monica College and earned my Associates of Arts degree in Liberal Studies. I then transferred to UC Santa Barbara where I double majored in both Psychology and Black Studies. Following my studies at UCSB I got accepted at USC where I ultimately earned a master's degree in Social Work. Five years after receiving my MSW degree, I decided to go back to school to get my doctorat e in clinical psychology (PsyD) with an emphasis in marriage, family and child psychotherapy from Ryokan College. In addition, Dr. Lipscomb earned a post -doc. certification in Diversity and Inclusion Practices from Cornell University. If it were not for my mentors over the years who modeled and believed in me \u2014I would not be where I am today as an educator, researcher and practitioner. I am a clinical psychologist by highest degree obtained and a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in the state of California. I n addition, I am a social scientist and my areas of research are centered around the psychiatric epidemiology among racialized and marginalized individuals who have experienced trauma (i.e. complex trauma, traumaticgrief and race- based trauma). Specificall y, I have conducted and advised numerous qualitative research studies (clinical case studies, interviews, ethnographies, etc.) on racialized Black identified men across the Black/African Diaspora (specifically in the United States) exploring their grief, l oss and complex -trauma experiences (i.e. special attention to physical health and mental health). And finally, I am an author and published a book titled: Black Male Grief Reaction to Trauma: A Clinical Case Study of One Man's Treatment. Title of Research Project \u2014 Exploring the Experiences of African American/Black Men Diagnosed with Advanced Stage and Terminal Prostate Cancer. Updated: March 2021 Page 40 of 76 Background & Purpose \u2014 The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the experiences of African American/Black men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer (i.e. both advanced and terminal cases). Utilizing narrative interviews, participants will be asked to share their experiences around being diagnosed with prostate cancer. Specifically, their emotive experiences around having a terminal illness. The information gathered through qualitative inquiry methodology can provide insight and feedback of the unique experiences faced by Black men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer giving special attention to their grief, loss and health related experiences (i.e. pre and post diagnosis). Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 What are the unique experiences of African American/Black who have been diagnosed with advanced stage or terminal prostate cancer? How do African American/Black men navigate their familial relationships, health, spirituality, mental health and loss experiences during this time? How can health and human service professional better assist and provide culturally appropriate services to this population? Method \u2014 Qualitative phenomenological inquiry methodology Student Roles \u2014 Data collection, transcribing data, conducting interviews, submitting abstracts to conferences. Expectations \u2014 I expect students to come ready to learn innovative ways to conduct research with marginalized communities who are often left out within scholarly spaces. In addition, to learn how to be an anti -oppressive researcher.

College of Science & Mathematics Department of Biology Lisa Banner ** NOT ACCEPTING NEW MENTEES FOR 2021-2022** Mentor Bio \u2014 I received my B.S. in Microbiology from San Diego State University. My interest in the nervous system began when I worked as a research technician in the Neurobiology Department at USC. There, I was exposed to and very involved in basic research. In choosing a graduate program I wanted to learn about molecular biology but still be involved in neuroscience. As a graduate student at USC, I studied the molecular biology of Coronaviruses. These large RNA viruses are responsi ble for some common colds but some can also infect the nervous system. As a postdoctoral research fellow at Caltech, I was able to apply my background in molecular biology to the study of the nervous system and began studies looking at the role of cytokine s in the nervous system. I was able to show that the cytokine LIF, functions as a neural -immune molecule following injury to the nervous system. Upon my arrival at CSUN I began a research program aimed at understanding how cytokines regulate the neural -immune axis using a mouse model of diabetes. Research Project Title \u2014 Determine the role of cytokines in the neural damage that occurs in prediabetes. Background and Purpose \u2014 My laboratory is interested in understanding how the nervous system and immune syst em interact. My approach to this question analyzes the regulation of cytokines known to function in both the nervous and immune systems using a mouse model of prediabetes. Diabetes is a major health and economic burden in the United States. According to s tatistics from the American Diabetes Association there are more than 30 million people (9.4% of the population) in the US with diabetes. One of the most common complications is damage to the nervous system, a condition known as diabetic neuropathy. It is becoming clear that the damage to central nervous system (brain) can occur even in a prediabetic state. Diet -induced obesity is an increasingly common occurrence that predisposes individuals to type-2 diabetes and contributes to complications including thos e of the nervous system and the immune system. Increased body mass and type -2 diabetes significantly increases the risk for neurodegeneration and dementia and changes in hippocampal plasticity and spatial learning among others have been documented. While t he exact mechanism has yet to be fully understood, neuroinflammation is thought to be an important factor in impaired cognitive function. Cytokines involved in the inflammatory response are elevated in brains of animals fed a high fat diet and a variety of anti- inflammatory/anti- oxidant treatments can reduce this expression and alleviate the cognitive changes. What is not well understood is how the progressive nature of cognitive defects, such as memory loss, manifests itself early in the process at the pre -diabetic stage and we seek to understand the role that cytokines play in this process. Specifically we are interested in the role of interleukin (IL) -6 because of its known role in inflammation and memory. Updated: March 2021 Page 43 of 76 Research Question/Hypothesis \u2014 Through the use of wildtype and interleukin -6 knockout mice we will test the hypothesis that interleukin- 6 and other cytokines play a role in the nervous system of prediabetic obese mice. Method \u2014 We use a variety of techniques to address our questions. To study learning an d memory we utilize behavioral tests such as the Morris Water Maze and Novel Object Recognition. To understand events at the molecular level we perform techniques such as RT -PCR, Western blots, ELISAs, and Immunohsitochemistry. Student Roles \u2014 Students at all levels are very involved in the experimental process from design through implementation and writing. Expectations \u2014 Students will play an active role in all areas of the lab. Sophomores and Juniors will learn from more senior members of the lab but by their Senior year, if not earlier, students will work on their own independent projects. Students are expected to present their research findings at local and/or national meetings. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 My laboratory attends the annual Society f or Neuroscience meeting.

Key Words \u2014 Diabetes, Neuroscience, Cytokines, Brain, Mice Chhandak Basu Mentor Bio \u2014 My doctoral work involved investigation of foreign gene expression in various plant tissues. In my postdoctoral work, I studied the incorporation and expression of the reporter gene (jelly fish green fluorescent protein or GFP) in herbicide tolerant weed species. Currently I am working in the field of biotechnology based biofuel development. My lab focuses on genetic transformation of plants and bacteria to produce biofuel like compounds. Ph.D. 2003, University of Rhode Island M.A. 1998, Montana State Uni versity B.S. 1996, B.C.K.V Background & Purpose \u2014 The overall goal in the lab is production of genetically engineered plants for trait enhancement and modification. In particular, we are interested in producing biofuel/biodiesel -like compounds in plants and bacteria. We are also interested in differential gene expression plants in various abiotic stressful conditions. Our final goal is cloning abiotic stress induced genes and transforming plants with these genes to produce environmental stress resistant genetically engineered plants Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 1) Overproduction of terpenes lead to production of biodiesel -like compounds in bacteria and plants; 2) Overexpression of abiotic stress induced genes will produce enviro nmental stress toleran t plants. Method \u2014 We use Agrobacterium tumefaciens , a soil borne bacteria to transform plants. We sequence the transcriptome of plants using the RNAseq technique and we analyze the transcriptome using bioinformatics software. Production of biofuel/biodiesel -like compounds will be analyzed by gas chromatograph- mass spectrometer. Global energy crisis (Problem) Overproduction of terpenes lead to production of biodiesel -like compounds in bacteria and plants (Hypothesis) Production of transgenic plants and bacteria (Experiment) Analyze transgenic plants and bacteria for potentials for biofuel production (Data analysis) Optimize best experimental approa ch to produce transgenic plants and bacteria for production of biofuel (Strategy deve lopment to address the problem) Student Roles \u2014 Students will be involved in experiments as described. It is expected that students will present their data in scientific c onferences and involved in writing manuscripts. All students will be expected to learn fundamentals of gene cloning and plant genetic engineering. Expectations \u2014 Students are encouraged to enroll in BIOL 470 (Biotechnology) and Recombinant DNA (BIOL 572) Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 America Society for Plant Biologists, Society for In Vitro Biology, International Plant and Animal Genome Conference Updated: March 2021 Page 44 of 76 David Bermudes ** NOT ACCEPTING NEW MENTEES FOR 2021 -2022 ** Research Focus #1 - Microbiome Background and Purpose \u2014 The primary goal of my microbiome research is to understand the role of secreted bacterial protease inhibitors. It has long been understood that the human microbiome has numerous bacteria that secrete proteases, some of which play roles in inflammation, however, there has been little attention to protease inhibitors that may play a role in stasis and the maintenance of normal skin and gut ecologi es. My lab is employing novel screening methods for isolation and analysis of bacteria p roducing secreted protease inhibitors to determine which bacteria produce them and what types of inhibitors they produce. Student Roles \u2014 Students in my lab learn basic isolation of bacterial strains, analysis of protease inhibitor production, PCR, 16sRN A sequencing, SDS -PAGE, reverse zymography and preparation of protein samples for protein sequence analysis (MALDI -TOF). Students will gain skills in and are responsible for performing PCR, DMA sequencing and analysis, protein and protease inhibitor analys is. Sophomores are expected to be able to plate bacterial samples from human skin to obtain single colony isolates and to screen them by performing protease inhibitor assays. Juniors are expected to be able to identify bacteria by performing PCR and send ing the DNA out for sequencing and analyze the DNA sequence. They are also expected to perform basic microscopy and bacteria biochemical tests used in identification. Seniors are expected to conduct SDS -PAGE gels and reverse zymography, to prepare protein samples for protein sequencing (MALDI -TOF) and to analyze the protein sequence data. Research Focus #2 - Cancer Background and Purpose \u2014 The primary goals of my cancer research are to use bacteria as therapeutic vectors for the treatment of tumors. Salmonella have many of the desirable properties of a cancer therapeutic delivery vector, including targeting of multiple tumors from a distant inoculation site, selective replication within tumors, tumor retardation, and the ability to express effector genes with antitumor proper ties directly within the tumor. My lab engineers genetic modifications to Salmonella and selects for suppressor mutations that are designed to enhance their antitumor properties and/or the ability to kill cancer c ells. Student Roles \u2014 Students in my lab learn basic DNA manipulation, gene expression techniques and microbial genetics in order to generate strains with the potential for enhance anticancer properties. Students will gain skills in and are responsible for designing PCR primers, pe rforming PCR, cloning genotypic and phenotypic changes. Sophomores are expected to be able to screen cloning reactions (ligations and transformations) by performing plasmid minipreps, conducting restriction endonuclease reactions, separation by gel electrophoresis and analysis of the resulting gel. Juniors are expected to be able to design and conduct cloning experiments and work with sophomores. Seniors are expected to be able to design PCR primers, carry out P CR reactions, clone and prepare DNA for DNA sequencing, be able to analyze the DNA sequence, and work with sophomores and/or juniors. Maria Elena de Bellard Mentor Bio \u2014 My passion for science started early, my father was one of the last explorers of Venezuela and our home was more a freeloading zoo than a regular house for 6 children. I went on to do my undergraduate school at a small, Caltech- like University in Caracas ( Universidad Simon Bolivar) then worked for 4 years in a lab studying the Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (which by the way you do not want to get infected with as I was due to a lab accident! But that is another story). I then decided to risk it all and got on plane and came to New York to start a Ph.D. program in biology. I was lucky that because my father's friendships with the Herpetologists at the American Museum of Natural History, I was able to volunteer for one year there helping a renowned herpetolog ist, Janis Roze classify snakes from the tropics. After this fun experience I entered a Ph.D. in Molecular, Cellular & Developmental Biology at the City University of NY and worked under the leadership of an extraordinary Irish woman, Marie T. Filbin. Her mentorship solidified my interest in neural research and from there I moved to Caltech to do a Post -doctoral Fellowship with another extraordinary woman: Marianne Bronner. Finally I began as a Biology Faculty at the Biology department at CSUN on 2005. Updated: March 2021 Page 45 of 76 Research Projects \u2014 \"Look at neural crest markers through evolution in sharks, snakes and lampreys\" & \"Identify molecules that determine the specific migratory pathways decisions by neural crest cells. \" Visit https://mariadebellard.wixsite.com/debellardlab for all projects. Background & Purpose \u2014 My lab focuses on understanding the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying the earliest events in n eural crest cell migration. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis 1) Identify molecules that determine the specific migratory pathways decisions by neural crest cells. The neural crest is a migratory population of cells but we know very little about the migratory clues that guide the neural crest for the rest of their path. It is the goal of this study to find which other molecules are capable of guiding the neur al crest along their migratory routes. For this purpose I had set out to screen a group of neurotrophic factors that are expressed at the same time that the crest is migrating through the embryo and which have been shown to be important in neural crest migration by analyzing the corresponding knockout mice (5). 2) Look at neural crest markers through evolution in sharks, snakes and lampreys. The neural crest appearance in evolution is critical for cranial formation and the development of the peripheral nervous system. The question my lab addresses is: How similar are the migratory routes of neural crest across evolution? We hypothesize that there are more similarities than differences. Method \u2014 My lab is interested in studying neural crest cell migration under many angles. With the help of highly driven undergraduates my lab has been able to develop new methods for studying neural crest cell migration in vitro and has set a reputation as a place to learn cell and neural crest biology/development among colleagues. We carry out classic cell biology experiments (cell migration, cancer analysis, molecular signals for migration), embryology studies (neural crest migration in live embryos, genetic manipulations) and the evo- devo of the neural crest across early vertebr ates (snakes, turtles, geckos, sharks, rays). In chemoattraction project students live image and track cells migrating; then they gather parameters (i.e. velocity and direction) and compare with control or other chemicals. In the evo -devo project, students analyze their data is by comparing their observations (morphological location of their stem cells in embryos) with what is known for other, more common organisms. Student Roles \u2014 Sophomore and junior students are part of the in- training cohort on their fi rst year. Senior students are generally working on their individual project and helping more junior undergraduates.

Robert Espinoza Mentor Bio \u2014 Robert Espinoza earned his BS in Biology at San Diego State University and Ph.D. in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology at the University of Nevada, Reno. He spent a year as a post -doctoral fellow at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and began his academic career at CSUN in 2001. He is cur rently a Professor of Biology and an Associate Dean of the College of Science and Mathematics. His research interests are in the physiology, ecology, and evolution of amphibians and reptiles. Ph.D. 2002, University of Nevada Reno B.S. 1990, San Diego State University Background & Purpose \u2014 Research in our lab is broadly concerned with understanding the physiological mechanisms that underlie animal diversity. In short, we seek to answer the \"how\" questions that pertain to animal function. Although most studies are at the whole- organism level, recent research has drawn on inferences from biochemical properties of cell membranes, to tissue- level processes, to populations and communities. Our research is also integrative and comparative, which means for we draw from several fields of inquiry (physiology, ecology, behavior, evolution) and include multiple species or populations in each investigation. Most of our research focuses on amphibians and reptiles, because these two groups of vertebrates are very dive rse (>7800 and >10,600 species, respectively) and possess many adaptations and specializations that capture the fascination of scientists and the general public alike. The evolutionary relationships are also well resolved for most groups Updated: March 2021 Page 46 of 76 of amphibians and reptiles, allowing us to test broad hypotheses concerning organismal diversit y in an evolutionary framework. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 Current research themes in our lab include: (1) thermal adaptation, (2) diet evolution, (3) the mechanisms underlying successful colonization by invasive species, and (4) the evolution of sociality. As ectotherms (\"cold -blooded\"), amphibians and reptiles are good models for studies of thermal adaptation because most aspects of their biology are closely linked to their abiotic environments. Reptiles are well suited to studies of diet evolution because closely related species often have different diets. This can help us identify the potential forces selecting for diet evolution, while testing the mechanisms underlying those shifts in diet, and the consequences of those shifts on morphology, physiology, behavior, and interactions with other species. Invasive species are ideally suited for testing rapid evolution in behavior, physiology, and ecology, as successful invas ives can become establish in climates that are radically different from their native ranges. Method \u2014 We use a diverse array of methods and analytical tools to address the broad range of studies conducted in our lab, often in collaboration with other labs at CSUN, across the US, and internationally. These include: genetics (currently: multilocus phylogenetic temperature- dependent performance, supercooling an d freeze tolerance, evaporative water loss, digestive efficiency, passage rate, etc.), morphology (gross dissections, histology, SEM/TEM), microbiology (genetically characterizing the microbiomes of host guts), and niche modeling and biogeography. Nearly e very new study brings with it new analytical tools, and we embrace new projects that offer new opportunities for collaboration with other labs and add new tools to our toolbox. Student Roles \u2014 In weekly lab meetings we practice giving presentations, write and review manuscripts and grant proposals, and discuss research papers.

Research Project s \u2014 \"Integrated Studies Into the Genomic, Metabolic, and Cultivable Diversity of the Human Gut SymbiontAkkermansia muciniphila\" & Dietary Driver s of the Human Gut Microbiome. Background & Purpose \u2014 The human gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that collectively are known as the gut microbiome. These microorganisms perform functions that are essential for normal human physiology but changes in the types of microorganisms in the gut have been associated with several diseases including obesity. Although numerous other factors play a role in the development of obesity, the composition of the gut microbiome is now considered an important environmental factor and a potential therapeutic target for tr eatment of obesity. Much of what we know about the association between the gut microbiome and obesity has been gleaned through observational studies of adult humans and from manipulative experiments using model organisms like mice. Given that childhood obe sity has more than doubled over the Updated: March 2021 Page 47 of 76 past 30 years particularly in ethnic minorities in the USA, identifying if an association also exists in children would strengthen our understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 Research in my lab seeks to identify the factors that influence the composition of the gut microbiome in both healthy and overweight/obese children. Factors of interest include both long -term and short - term dietary habits, and antibiotic use. Method \u2014 To address these questions, we utilize cutting -edge genomic techniques coupled with more traditional microbiological methods to characterize the microorganisms at the community and species levels. Student Roles \u2014 Students working in my lab will gain valuab le hands -on experience in both wet -lab (e.g. DNA extraction, PCR, DNA sequencing, bacterial cultivation, etc.) and bioinformatics based methods. Expectations \u2014 Students working in my lab are expected to develop independent projects with my guidance but can also expect to work collaboratively with other graduate and undergraduate students. I also expect students to immerse themselves in the primary literature outside of their designated laboratory times so long as it does not interfere with their coursewo rk. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 Conferences typically attended by students and myself include the American Society of Microbiology General Meeting (every May/June), the International Society of Microbial Ecology Meeting (even years in August), and the ASM Conference on Beneficial Microbes (even years, September). Publications \u2014 To see a full list of Dr. Flores' publications, writings and press coverage, please visit: https://gilbertof lores.weebly.com/publications.html Yoshie Hanzawa Mentor Bio \u2014 A primary goal of my research is to understand the genetic bases of reproductive transition of plants (flowering) in response to environmental signals, and to clarify how these mechanisms have evolved. My research currently focuses on the evolution of the flowering gene network in Arabidopsis and soybean, taking an interdisciplinary approach encompassing molecular genetics, genomics, biochemistry, population genetics and systems biology, wi th an ultimate goal of plant improvement for higher adaptation to diverse and changing environments. Background & Purpose \u2014 Phosphatidylethanolamine -binding proteins (PEBP), also known as Raf-kinase inhibitor proteins, play critical roles in the regulation of diverse signaling pathways controlling cell growth and differentiation in bacteria, plants and animals and affect a range of diseases including cancer metastasis, pancreatitis as well as Alzheimer's disease, which makes PEBP a particularly su itable target for precision medicine and individualized therapy. In plants, FT and TFL1 in the PEBP family govern a unique and simple molecular switch that modulates the activity of the transcription factor FD and determines the fate of meristematic cells in reproductive transition (flowering), offering the novel molecular mechanisms to engineer PEBP signaling cascades for disease- specific therapeutic intervention. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 Both FT and TFL1 bind FD and modulate expression of the floral meris tem identity genes that control development of the reproductive organs. However, FT and TFL1 act i n an opposite manner; the FT-FD complex induces this process, while TFL1 -FD represses. Our preliminary work identified that FD phosphorylation at Threonine 282 in the C -terminus is responsible for the transcription activator action of FD, and that multiple Calcium - Dependent Protein Kinases (CPK phosphorylate FD at T282. We hypothesize that regulated by FT and T FL1. Altern atively, FT and TFL1 may control subsequent cellular actions of FD depending on FD's phosphorylation status. Method and xpressed in protoplast cells of Arabidopsis with FT, TFL1 or control and the biochemical and cellu lar actions of FD and mutant FD will be examined, including phosphorylation by CPKs, interaction with FT and TFL1, organelle localization, stability and transcription activity. The function of FD, mutant FD and CPKs in flowering transi tion will be tested by creating transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing these proteins or carrying mutations using the latest CRISPR/Cas 9 systems available for plants. Data analysis: Protein abundance, phosphorylation and immunoprecipitation will be observed using Western Blotting and quantification by biotin or 32P labeling, and localization and i nteraction using fluorescent or confocal microscope. Updated: March 2021 Page 48 of 76 Transcription of downstream genes will be examined us ing quantitative RT -PCR. Flower ing phenotypes will be assessed by the numbers of days and l eaves produced before flowering and statistical analyses w ill be conducted using Excel or SAS. Student Roles \u2014 All levels of students will participate in cloning, Western, plan t transformation and screening, express ion studies and phenotypic analyses. In addition, junior and senior students will contribute to experimental design and interpretation of results, and senior studen ts to training of sophomore and junior students and presentation of results at conferences and in peer -reviewed journals. Expectations \u2014 Students in this project will learn in -depth knowledge in signaling mechanisms controlling diverse diseases and techniques in emerging molecular genetic, biochemical and genome editing approaches that are exten sively applied to biomedical research including precision medicine solutions.

Mariano Loza-Coll Mentor Bio \u2014 I went to university in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I majored in Biology and specialized in animal physiology. For my PhD, I moved to Canada, and received my degree from the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto, where I studi ed cancer cell biology. Then I came to the United States (first to San Diego, and then Los Angeles), where I trained as a postdoc investigating the genetics basis of asymmetric cell decisions using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as an experimental m odel system. In the Fall 2015 I joined the Department of Biology at CSUN, where my students and I are currently investigating the genetic control of stem cells in flies. You may visit our lab's website at: https://lozacollcsunbio.wordpress.com Title of Research Project \u2014 Genetic regulation of adult stem cells in Drosophila melanogaster Background & Purpose \u2014 In order to remain functional, many of our organs can replace cells that are lost to injury or wear, thanks to the activity of adult stem cells. Like their embryonic counterparts, adult stem cells undergo \"asymmetric self-renewing divisions\", generating a new copy of themselves (to maintain a healthy stem cell pool) and a cell that differentiates into a specific cell type that replaces missing cells in the organ. A long -term objective of my laboratory is to characterize the genetic regulatory mechanisms and networks that control adult stem cells across tissues. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 One of the general hypotheses that we are actively investigating at this time is that systemic stress can affect the genetic regulation of stem cells, impairing the capacity of their host tissues to maintai n homeostasis and/or properly recover from injury. Method \u2014 We normally combine classical Drosophila genetics, tissue dissections and high resolution microscopy to determine how stressful stimuli may affect major genetic pathways controlling the number, activity and responsiveness of diverse adult stem cell populations in flies. We also try to identify new genetic modules and pathways through the bioinformatics, integrating public datasets from genome -wide screens related to stem cells. In a typical experiment, we would subject flies that carry cell -type specific markers and genetic activity reporters to any of a number of forms of systemic stressors (e.g. heat shocks, intoxication, reproductive isolation). After several days, we dissect relevant organs/tissues out of the fly, and analyze the expression of the cell type and activity markers through microscopy, which allows us to not only quantify adult stem cells in a tissue, but also the identity and function of their progeny. Student Roles \u2014 None of the techniques used in our lab (setting up and caring for Dr osophila crosses, dissecting tissues and preparing samples for microscopy) demand any special skills or prior training, nor do they involve hazardous reagents or equipment. Therefore, students at all levels (sophomore, junior and senior) can and will be involved in each and all steps of our experiments. While I encourage teamwork within our group, I also expect that my students can work independently and develop a sense of ownership and pride in their projects. Expectations \u2014 I expect my students to take th e project and themselves very seriously, because I also take them both very seriously. For us to maintain a productive and meaningful mentorship relationship, I mostly need to see that our lab is a top priority for the student. From me, students can expect respect, patience, dedication and a profound passion for doing science. In my lab, students will learn how to set up genetic crosses, predict their outcomes, dissect tissues and carry out fairly sophisticated fluorescence microscopy. But much more importa ntly, they will learn to think independently Updated: March 2021 Page 50 of 76 as scientists, evaluate evidence critically, and formulate testable hypotheses. In addition, I strongly advocate the communication of scientific progress, challenges and approaches to society at large. I have sp earheaded several science communication and outreach projects, including the development of a website for the dissemination of science news to a broad readership (www.science4everybody.com). Regardless of their future career choices, science majors will be our science ambassadors, interpreters and advocates in society. Therefore, besides providing my students with the best experimental genetics training that I can offer, I will passionately mentor them to develop sound communication skills.

My research focuses on understanding the mechanisms by which cancers begin and then later acquire the ability to metastasize. We also study these same mechanisms during tissue regeneration to better understand their normal contexts. By understanding what drives cancer and what prevents complete tissue regeneration, we aim to develop novels therapeutic strategies.

Background & Purpose \u2014 Broadly, we seek to characterize the molecular mechanisms and functions of genes that play critical roles in cancer and tissue regeneration. Our work integrates molecular/cellular biology, signaling biochemistry, animal models of normal development and disease, and microscopy imaging to answer questions in these fields. Ongoing Projects: 1) Switching of TGFbeta signaling outcomes in normal and disease states; 2) Innate and acquired therapy resistance in breast cancer; 3) Tissue regeneration and wound hea ling; 4) Biomarker identification in pancreatic cancer; 5) Influence of the microenvironment on homeostasis and cancer progression. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 How do changes in gene expression and subcellular protein localization coordinately regulate stem cell behavior during tissue regeneration? How do intracellular scaffolding proteins mediate TGFbeta -mitogenic signaling and tumor progression in res ponse to extracellular cues? Questions such as these are at the center of our lab's research efforts. In many cases, genes that are known to perform critical roles during development also have integral functions during cancer initiation and progression. In this regard, cancer may be considered a recapitulation of developmental (or regenerative) processes in an inappropriate temporal and spatial manner. Gene families such as TGF -beta and EGF along with their receptors, co -receptors and intracellular mediator s are central regulators of essential stages during vertebrate development. Notably, however, many of these genes are deregulated in multiple tissue types to induce oncogenesis and are classified as developmental oncogenes. Fluctuations in the genetic and/or epigenetic states of developmental oncogenes are most abundant during embryogenesis in utero and regenerative/healing or cancer initiation/progression processes in the adult. Cripto (TDGF1, tumor -derived growth factor one) and PEAK1 (SGK269) are two dev elopmental oncogenes that our research group is studying with regard to how they control cell proliferation/migration of tumor cells and govern critical steps during stem cell recruitment/differentiation in tissue development/regeneration. We are also inte rested in identifying new Updated: March 2021 Page 51 of 76 genetic/molecular regulators of tumor phenotypes in breast and pancreatic cancers, and further identifying any novel developmental functions that these genes may have.

Keywords: Permafrost, climate change, genomics, genetics, metagenomics, bioinformatics, microbiology. Background & Purpose \u2014 Our lab is broadly interested in understanding microbial populations by integrating next -generation tools such as high -throughput DNA sequencing with traditional microbiology approaches. Our overarching goals are two -fold. Microbial life exists in many extreme env ironments including permafrost, soil in the arctic that has been frozen for thousands of years. Understanding how permafrost microorganisms survive and grow can give us insights into exobiology, global warm ing, and antibiotic resistance. Research Question( s) or Hypothesis \u2014 (1) Exobiology \u2014 A fundamental goal of exobiology is to investigate the boundaries at which life can exist to inform the search for habitable environments and life outside Earth. Since six of the eight other planets in our solar system, as well as their moons, asteroids, and comets are permanently frozen, life \u2014if it exists \u2014on these other celestial bodies is most likely to be found in a sub- zero environment. On Earth, permafrost acts as analogue to Mars and other cryogenic bodies. If we ca n understand how microbial life survives in permafrost on Earth, it will help us understand how life may survive on other planets in our solar system and beyond. (2) Climate change\u2014 One quarter of the earth's terrestrial surface is underlain by permafrost, or perennially frozen soils. Permafrost soils contain approximately 25% to 50% of the total global soil carbon pool. Permafrost carbon is protected from microbial degradation by freezing temperatures. However, rising global temperatures are causing the permafrost to thaw. As the permafrost thaws, it is predicted that microorganisms will become more active and that organic Updated: March 2021 Page 52 of 76 matter will become increasingly accessible for microbial degradation, releasing large amounts of greenhouse gasses into the atmospher e. We study how permafrost microbes degrade carbon in order to predict its contribution to climate change. (3) Antibiotic resistance \u2014Antibiotics were discovered more than 70 years ago and revolutionized medicine. Growing antibiotic resistance due to misuse is threatening the effectiveness of these medications. We study the history of antibiotic resistance by studying antibiotic resistance genes in microbial communities that have not been exposed to antibiotics \u2014 those that have been trapped in per mafrost for thousands of years. Method \u2014 Our lab uses a large number of techniques including standard laboratory procedures (ex: DNA extraction & manipulation, PCR, culturing of bacteria) and computational analysis of large -scale genomic data sets. Students may select lab or computer based studies. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 Members of the lab have attended the following conferences: American Society of Microbiology, International Society for Microbial Ecology, and the Interna tional Conference on Permafrost. Publications \u2014 For a fu ll list of publications, visit her lab website . Cindy Malone Mentor Bio \u2014 Dr. Malone earned her B.S in Biology at Illinois State University and her PhD in Microbiology and Immunology at UCLA. She continued her Post -doctoral work at UCLA in Molecular Genetics. Dr. Malone is the Director of the $6.1M CSUN -UCLA Bridges to Stem Cell Research Program funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Dr. Malone's own research in her CSUN lab is aimed at understanding how genes are regulated through genetic mechanisms that alter gene expression. https://www.csun.edu/science - mathematics/biology/cindy -malone Check out her Elite Gene Team App , E-Portfolio, and Youtube Channel . Background & Purpose \u2014 Appropriately controlling when and where genes are turned on and off is essential for cells to function normally and avoid becoming cancerous or dying prematurely. The expression of a gene is usually controlled by adjacent DNA sequences, called the gene pr omoter that functions essentially as an \"on/off switch\". In a previous study, we linked a set of genes to both an aggressive cancer and non -aggressive/indolent cancer by an analysis of genes expressed (turned on) in an aggressive mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) compared the genes to the expressed non -aggressive small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). We study the promoter regions of these genes to determine why and how they are expressed or not in our lymphoma tumor samples. Our study will provide new insight for how these lymphoma associated genes are controlled and may increase the knowledge of how gene expression is controlled in general. Enhanced understanding from our studies should provide information for why certain cancers are very aggressive and others are les s aggressive and therefore have a higher long -term survival rate. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 We hypothesize that these identified lymphoma -associated genes are dysregulated in these cancers and therefore play a role in their aggressive or non -aggressive natures, respectively. Method \u2014 Promoter analysis of these genes, first in an epithelial cell line and subsequently in MCL and SLL cell lines, will identify how these genes are regulated and will lead to in vivo promoter regulation studies. We use bioinformatics (computer analysis) first, to identify the promoter regions of the lymphoma associated genes we found, then we isolate the promoter DNA region and determine how they are turned on and off. Molecular genetics techniques such as PCR, subcloni ng, restriction digest analysis, gel electrophoresis, directed mutagenesis, transient transfection, and dual luciferase analysis are used. Student Roles \u2014 Students of all levels can run their own project from start to finish. Studen ts choose a gene from the list of lymphoma -associated genes, identify and design PCR primers to the promoter region, PCR and subclone. After they verify their promoter by sequencing, they will perform transient transfections dual luciferase analysis. Site- directed mutagenesis and subsequent transient transfections and analysis will be performed to identify how the promoter is turned on and off. Expectations \u2014 Students present their work at conferences and are integral in the manuscript and publication submi ssion process. Students performing research in my laboratory often go on to CSUN UCLA Bridges to Stem Cell Research Program, PhD programs, industry jobs, and professional schools.

Background & Purpose \u2014 My primary interest is in understanding how cells die. There are multiple forms of cell death; the one I am most interested in is called 'apoptosis' or 'programmed cell death'. It is a form of cellular suicide, where the dying cell activates within itself a series of well-orchestrated events including activation and repression of precise sets of genes, which modulate the execution. Excessive apoptosis, or a defect in the process has been implicated in diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. My long -term goal is to understand the biochemical and molecular basis of apoptosis and to utilize this information to design therapeutic strategies to alleviate or ove rcome human diseases, particularly cancer. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 Using both conventional methods and microarray technology, we have identified a set of genes that may modulate leukemic cell apoptosis. We are testing the hypothesis that these genes play a crucial role in early steps of chemotherapy -induced apoptosis of leukemic cells. The molecular pathway for apoptosis involving each of these genes is being systematically studied, along with po tential cross -talk among them. Method \u2014 We are s tudying the molecular events associated with apoptosis of leukemic cells in response to therapeutic agents such as glucocorticoid hormones, immunosuppressants and anti -proliferative agents, in parallel models of glucocorticoid -sensitive and - resistant huma n lymphoblastic cells. This work involves the use of modern cell and molecular biology techniques such as mammalian cell culture, morphological and biochemical characterization of cells; DNA and RNA isolation and characterization by restriction digestion, Southern and Northern blotting and polymerase chain reaction; protein expression and analysis by Western Blotting; protein -protein interaction and DNA -protein interaction studies etc. Various anti -cancer drugs are being tested in cell culture models of can cer for their ability to alter gene expression, and induce apoptosis. Key gene regulatory events that trigger apoptosis are being identified. Students will perform experiments to generate data on drug -induced cell death, apoptosis and gene regulation. Data will be analyze d through standardized methods. Student Roles \u2014 There are a number of potential projects for undergraduate and graduate students interested in this field of research. Student projects vary depending on the qualifications, background and goa ls of the student. Students obtain training in research methodology, scientific thinking, critical analyses as well as learn diverse techniques including cell culture, SDS -PAGE and Western blotting, DNA/RNA extraction and purification, Restriction enzyme digestions, PCR, DNA cloning, Northern hybridization, reverse transcription, get assays, reporter gene assays, cell proliferation assays, apoptosis assays and flow cytometry. Expectations \u2014 Under my mentorship, students are expected to perfor m experiments, interpret data, and discuss their research outcomes among peers in laboratory meetings, write reports summarizing their data, and present their research findings at local, reg ional, and national conferences.

Spangler Nicholas Prize for best Ph.D. thesis in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale University . Research Interests \u2014 The dimorphic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus is a model organism for studying the bacterial cell cycle. Its asymmetric cell division results in one swarmer and one stalked cell progeny. Motile swarmer cells can not undergo DNA replication until they differentiate into stationary stalked cells. If sufficient nutrients are available, swarmer cells eject their polar flagellum and build a stalk (with adhesive at its end; for attaching to a surface near nutrients) at the same pole formerly occupied by the flagellum. Stalked cells are competent for DNA replication and cell division. During cell division, a flagellum is placed at the pole opposite that of the stalk. Caulobacter's obligate cell cycle is controlled by oscillating master regulators that control different genetic modules in space and time. As a result of this carefully orchestrated process, a flagellum is synthesized only when needed (just prior to cell division) and is placed at the pole opposite that of the stalk. Likewise, a new stalk is synthesized only at the pole previously occupied by a flagellum. Our lab studies the roles of lipid biosynthesis in this process, using pharmacological, genetic, and molecular approaches. Only by further elucidating the control mechanisms of bacterial cell division can we advance the development of new antimicrobial compounds. Lipid biosynthesis is essential for cell viability and bacterial fatty acid synthetic enzymes have been suggested as antibiotic targets. In fact, compounds specific to bacterial fatty acid biosynthetic compounds have been gener ated. Most previous studies on bacterial lipid metabolism have focused on E. coli, a gamma -proteobacteria. Caulobacter in contrast, as an alpha -proteobacteria, is closely related to human pathogenic bacteria, such as Brucella and Rickettsia. Background & Purpose \u2014 The purpose of my research is to study how cells enter and exit the bacterial cell cycle in response to stresses such as starvation or antibiotic treatment. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 My research questions include: 1) W hat genes are differentially regulated during starvation? Methods: RNA will be extracted from starved bacterial cells. cDNA libraries will be created and deep -sequencing will identify changes in transcript abundance in bacterial cultures grown under various conditi ons. CSUN students will analyze the data using bioinformatic computational tools. Murray Lab members will confirm the changes in gene expression using real -time qPCR or transcriptional reporters. 2) Which of the starvation -upregulated genes contribute to persistence during starvation? Methods: A subset of differentially regulated genes identified through deep- sequencing will be selected for gene knock - outs. The gene knockout strains will be tested for survival during starvation. Gene knock- outs will be confirmed using molecular genetic techniques. The strains will be tested for survival during starvation using direct counts, colony formation , and live/dead stains. 3) Do the starvation -upregulated genes contribute to persistence d uring antibiotic treatment? Methods: A subset of differentially regulated genes identified through deep- sequencing will be selected for gene knock - outs. The gene knockout strains will be tested for survival during starvation. Gene knock- outs will be confi rmed using molecular genetic techniques. The strains will be tested for survival during antibiotic treatment using direct counts, colony formation, and live/dead stains. Student Roles \u2014 Sophomores will make bacterial growth media and solutions, culture ba cteria using the aseptic techqnique, and clone PCR products into vectors to create transcriptional reporters. Juniors will confirm gene transcription using transcriptional reporters and create geneknockouts. Seniors will use real -time qPCR to validate differentially - regulated genes during starvation and will test gene knock -out strains for persistence in starved - or antibiotictreated cells.

Research Project Title \u2014 Genomic and behavioral basis of speciation in field crickets Background & Purpose \u2014 Research in the Robertson Lab focusses on the evolutionary processes that mediate lineage diversification specia tion, including the relative roles of gene flow and selection A Build PODER student will examine the evolution of reproductive isolation in two divergent lineages of crickets that co -occur in narrow contact zone, and will determine the extent of hybridizat ion in these two lineages using an integrated field and molecular genetic research approach. The two cricket species are nearly indistinguishable except for color and habitat preference. While G. saxatilis is uniformly black in coloration and prefers rocky outcrops, G. navajo exhibits color polymorphism, ranging from black to red, and occurs on red, sandy substrate. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 Aim 1: We predict that the black color form of G. navajo morphs represent a hybrid cross with G. saxatilis in the contact zone. Aim 2: We expect that natural selection acts on color morph in the contact zone of Goblin Valley, Arizona. Method \u2014 Mixed method. Molecular Ecology & Ecological Field -based research. Aim 1 : A high- throughput sequencing approach (RADseq) will be used to genotype individuals of both G. navajo and G. saxatilis, with a focus on contact zone populations. RADseq data will be filtered through abioinformatics pipeline. We will conduct a suite of analyses including genetic diversity estimates, genetic clustering analyses (e.g., STRUCTURE, PCA) to determine genetic groupings. The program NewHybrids will be used to examine the extent of hybridization; this metric will allow us to estimate the extent of hybridization in the wild and distinguish amo ng multiple hybrid generations. Aim 2: Students will perform field -based measure of natural selection in the contact zone. Enclosures will test for survival of crickets that are both cryptic and conspicuous. We will uncover a signal of strong selection if survival is higher in cryptic color forms. Student Roles \u2014 This research includes both field and molecular laboratory research. At all levels, students will conduct fieldwork in the summers of 2018- 2019 in Utah, Arizona and California (natural selection st udies, field sampling). Advanced students (Juniors/Seniors) will have the opportunity to work alongside a graduate student and PI to perform bioinformatics. Students will be mentored in all aspects of manuscript preparation and submission. Updated: March 2021 Page 56 of 76 Expectations \u2014 The student can expect to gain experience in both field, experimental laboratory, and molecular genetics. In the lab, the student will learn: DNA extraction, DNA quantification and all aspects of library construction for next -generation sequencing. Both the heritability and molecular components of this research will help students develop skills that can be broadly applicable to all biotechnology and medicine fields. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 A BUILD PODER student will present findings at the CSUN stud ent research symposium, held annually and will be expected to attend one of the scientific conferences: Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB); Evolution; and/or the Ecological Society of America (ESA).

Background & Purpose \u2014 Our ultimate goal is to develop novel ways of preventing and treating infectious diseases caused by bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics. These bacteria are major threat to public health worldwide, and in many cases, have become completely untreateable. Our laboratory uses a multidisci plinary approach to: (1) Study the molecular mechanisms of multidrug resistance in order to develop new antimicrobials; (2) Study the role of multidrug efflux pumps in cell physiology and motility; and (3) Study the distribution of antibiotic resistant bac teria and identify novel antibiotic resistance genes. Please see our Research webpage for a more detailed description: https://ruizruedalab.wordpress.com/ Projects in more detail 1) Studying the regulation and physiological role of the AcrAB -TolC multidrug efflux pump. This pump is the main multidrug efflux pump in Escherichia coli and many other pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. The AcrAB effluxes bile salts and other exogenous toxic compounds. A better understanding of its regulation and function is essential to develop novel efflux inhibitors capable of restoring antibiotic efficacy and to uncover the role of this pump in motility and cell physiology. 2) Identification of carbapenem -resistant bacteria and genes. Carbapenems are last resort antibiotics used in healthcare facilities to treat multidrug resistant bacteria. Carbapenem -resistant bacteria, especially Gram -negatives, are often untreatable and are associated with mortality. The CDC has designated them as an urgent threat. Our overall goal is to examine the distribution, frequency and type of carbapenem -resistant bacteria found in different locations to better predict and prevent pote ntial outbreaks in the future. We are especially interested in combining genomics and molecular biology to identify novel genes and genetic mobile elements conferring resistance to carbapenems and other antibiotics. Method \u2014 My laboratory uses a multidisciplinary approach that includes bacterial genetics and biochemistry, molecular biology, gene expression experiments, and \"omics\" to study resistance to multiple antibiotics in bacteria, to ultimately identify new antimicrobials and targets; as wel l as to develop novel detection methods. I organize research so students participate in different projects and learn different techniques such as antibiotic susceptib ility testing, mutagenesis, gene deletion, gene electrophoresis, PCR, LDR, qPCR, RT -qPCR, gene expression, Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatics. As students gain experience, they can then choose on which projects to focus. Updated: March 2021 Page 57 of 76 Student Roles \u2014 By combining global transposon mutagenesis and untargeted metabolomics, s tudents will identify regulatory and metabolic pathways that reduce the expression or activity of multidrug efflux pumps. Students will then use genetics, gene expression and biochemical methods to further characterize these pathways and pinpoint the cellu lar metabolites that affect these pumps. They will also determine their mechanism of action, whether they are pump substrates, and their potential as therapeutics capable of preventing antibiotic efflux. Students will also use this knowledge to develop novel molecular detection methods capable of identifying pathogens and their resistance genes in raw samples or metagenomic DNA. I organize research so students participate in different projects and learn different techniques such as antibiotic susceptibility testing, mutagenesis, gene deletion, gene cloning, DNA and protein electrophoresis, qPCR, RT -qPCR, Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatics. As students gain experience, they can then choose on which projects to focus. Expectations \u2014 My final goal is that my students learn the techniques and develop the critical thinking and communication skills that will make them successful in pursuing their careers in the biomedical and health sciences. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 I encourage m y students to use their results to prepare communications for conferences they will be attending, such as CSUPERB Annual Meeting, the American Society for Microbiology General Meeting, and the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherap y Meeting; as well as to write publications for peer -reviewed journals.

Following my masters, I worked in the diagnostics and lab- on-a-chip industry in Northern California for five years. At that point, I wanted to change industries and foc us more on research, which led me to graduate school at Cornell University. My graduate work was in the field of RNA synthetic biology, where I focused on engineering RNA gene regulators for use in controlling bacteria. I followed up my graduate work with a postdoc at MIT where I again engineered RNA regulators, but this time for use in nucleic acid diagnostics. See my lab website: www.takahashi -lab.org . Title of Research Project - Discovering novel antimicrobial agents that target sRNA regulated antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Purpose and Background - The increase in antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria represents a major threat to human health and necessitates a demand for novel treatment strategies. Parti cularly important is bacteria's ability to adapt to the presence of antibiotics, thus limiting its efficacy. This presents a major challenge because while we can identify effective antimicrobial agents, bacteria can adapt to minimize their effect. One way bacteria adapt to the presence of antibiotics is through regulation of genes by sRNAs. For example, the sRNA MicF modulates antibiotic resistance in E. coli by regulating the production of OmpF, a porin involved in antibiotic uptake. Deletion of micF incre ases susceptibility to the antibiotics cephalosporin and norfloxacin. Therefore, trans -acting sRNAs have the potential to be new targets for antimicrobial compounds. Research Questions/Hypotheses - In this project, we will determine if peptides can be de signed to inhibit sRNAs and used in a combination therapy to counteract bacteria's natural adaptation mechanisms thus increasing the efficacy of existing antibiotics. Methods - We will utilize a cell- free gene expression system to develop a platform to rap idly produce and screen candidate peptides for their ability to interfere with sRNA binding to its target. A fusion of the target mRNA to GFP will allow for simple determination of sRNA function. Specific binding interactions between peptides and sRNAs wil l be determined using designed sRNA mutants. Successful peptide candidates will then be tested for efficacy in E. coli. Updated: March 2021 Page 58 of 76 Student roles - Students will learn all laboratory skills involved in the project including: molecular cloning, PCR, cell-free lysate pr oduction, cell -free experiments, and determining MICs. More experienced students will be encouraged to design and interpret experiments independently. Expectations - Students working in my lab will be set up with their own individual project. This may rang e from smaller sub -projects for newer students to bigger, year -long projects for more experienced students. Students can also expect to work together with other students and are encouraged to help each other in the lab. My goal is to provide my students wi th the tools they need to succeed in their future whether that be graduate school, industry, or otherwise. To that end, I encourage ongoing conversations about goals and what we can do to reach them. Conferences typically attended - Synthetic biology: Engi neering, Evolution & Design (SEED), Gordon Research Conference on Synthetic Biology.

Casey terHorst ** NOT ACCEPTING NEW MENTEES FOR 2021 -2022** Mentor Bio - If you're still trying to figure out what career you want, I understand. I was a History major at USC and was about to set off for law school when I became captivated by science. I came to CSUN to take a few classes before deciding to stay here and work on my Masters degree, and eventually a PhD at Florida State. Being back at my alma mater means that I get the chance to get students as excited about biology as I am. I'm an ecologist, but I'm really interested in understanding how evolution affects how spec ies interact with each other. Predators interact with their prey by eating them, or at least scaring them. What happens if the prey evolve a defense? How does that change their interaction? Often, evolution happens too slowly for us to observe, but by using species with very short generation times, we're able to observe evolution in the lab and test a number of eco- evo questions. Title of Research Project - Does rapid evolution and dispersal alter local bacterial communities? Eco -Evo Lab (ecoevolab.com) Background & Purpose - Research in our lab focuses on evolution that happens so quickly that it affects interactions between species and their environment. Although we often think about evolution on the scale of millions of years, because microbes have such short generation times, they have the potential to evolve over the course of days or weeks. Such rapid evolution may affect their ecological interactions with other species, including competitors, predators, and mutualists. As we understand the role that m icrobes play in human health more and more, understanding the eco- evolutionary dynamics of microbial species is key to understanding how we treat infection and disease. Research Questions or Hypothesis - The current project in my lab seeks to understand h ow eco -evolutionary interactions at the local scale (e.g., within one human body) might be affected by dispersal at the regional scale (e.g., transmission of microbes among people). We hypothesize that a little bit of dispersal might make selection very important, as it will select for or against the new migrants into the population. However, at higher migration rates, this may prevent any effects of natural selection. Method - We are using the community of bacteria and protozoa that live within the leaves of carnivorous pitcher plants as a model system to examine these eco -evolutionary interactions. We conduct experiments in laboratory microcosms in which we manipulate the selection environment on microbial species. The quantitative methods we use are all conducted in the R Statistical environment, a platform being used commonly by most scientists today. Student Roles - Students in the lab will be able to conduct their own experiments using this system, but will also be trained in molecular techniques that w e use to sequence DNA and identify the bacterial species that are present. Students will learn how to culture microbes, how to extract DNA from cultures, and molecular techniques, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Students also have the option to le arn bioinformatics that we use to identify microbial species. Students in the lab will be encouraged to attend and present their research at scientific conferences. Expectations - We look for students in the lab that can work independently and are interest ed in exploring their own individual projects, with sufficient guidance from the faculty and graduate students in the lab. Schedules can be somewhat Updated: March 2021 Page 59 of 76 flexible, but require reliable students. Students can expect to receive all the help they ask for, both in terms of research methods and in mentorship about how to navigate the scientific world. Students are given a fair amount of independence, but guidance is available whenever needed. Most of the people in the lab are first -gen college students from diverse backgrounds, so most people can relate to the experiences of CSUN students. Conferences Typically Attended - Students in the lab will be encouraged to attend and present their research at scientific conferences. Students typically present at the CSUNposium on campus. However, past students have also presented research at the Ecological Society of America annual meeting, the Evolution conference, or more locally, the Western Society of Naturalists annual meeting.

I grew up in Calgary, Canada and received my Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry from the University of Calgary in 1993. I fell in love with genetics thanks to a great teacher, and I've been doing genetics ever since. I went to Princet on to study developmental genetics in Drosophila under Trudi Schupbach, then to Caltech to study behavioral genetics in C. elegans under Paul Sternberg. Here at CSUN I strive to pay forward the inspiration given to me by my professors and mentors along the way. Name of Lab \u2014 FIRE (Full Immersion Research Experience) Background & Purpose \u2014 The purpose of our lab's research is to understand the origin and function of sleep. We do this by studying one of the simpler organisms known to enter a sleep state: the nematode C. elegans. This animal is highly amenable to molecular -genetic analysis, and importantly, shares conserved sleep -regulating pathways with vertebrates. We expect that our work in C. elegans will shed light on the function of sleep in humans. Our lab has recently shown that, in response to stressful conditions such as heat, high salt, and toxin exposure, C. elegans will enter a sleep -like state. Importantly, we have shown that this sleep state enhances survival following extreme stress. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 We posit that perturbations of cellular homeostasis drive sleep behavior, which in turn allows allocation of resources towa rd restoration of homeostasis. Method \u2014 We are testing our hypothesis using mutants that are known to be either defective in, or abnormally good at, restoration of protein folding. We are performing molecular -genetic analyses to characterize the signaling pathway that mediates stress- induced sleep behavior. Student Roles \u2014 Students examining sleep behavior will collect data on the sleep responses animals at various times following various s tressors, and analyze the data using appropriate statistical methods. Students examining the molecular mechanism of cellular stress- induced sleep will examine gene expression, perform molecular cloning, RNA -mediated interference (RNAi), PCR, and other stan dard molecular techniques. Each student has the opportunity to choose from among several projects based on their interests. We perform molecular cloning as well as organismal/behavioral assays, all contributing to our overall goal of understanding the func tion of sleep. Junior students can work as part of a team with more experienced students in the lab, learning techniques and gaining knowledge of the scientific method. More senior students develop independent research projects that often contribute to publications from the lab, which looks very good on their CVs! Expectations \u2014 Undergraduate students involved in my research program have been very competitive for PhD programs, as well as for entrance to health professional schools. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 Students in the lab have presented their work at CSUPERB (each January in California), CSUN symposia, the Society for Neuroscience (SFN) meeting, the Gordon conference on Sleep Regulation, and the international C. elegans meeting (in June of eve ry other year at UCLA).

I use field studies, mathematical models, and genomic data to understand how interacti ng species shape each other's evolutionary history. PhD research with Olle Pellmyr at the University of Idaho Postdoctoral research with Peter Tiffin at the University of Minnesota, and Sally Aitken at the University of British Columbia Lab website: https: //lab.jbyoder.org/ Background & Purpose \u2014Background & Purpose \u2014 Most multicellular organisms host communities of microbes \u2014 symbionts \u2014 that provide nutrients, biological services, even defense against natural enemies. The human gut microbiome is one promi nent example; the mutualism by which soil bacteria help \"fix\" nitrogen from the atmosphere to provide fertilizer for many plants is another. Natural selection can favor the evolution of \"cheater\" symbionts that take the benefits of life with a host but do not provide services in response, and most hosts prevent this using \"sanctions\" that expel or penalize unhelpful symbionts. Nevertheless, symbionts often vary in their helpfulness, and hosts often accept less-helpful symbionts. My research has found that l ess-helpful symbionts can persist when hosts select symbionts via signals separate from the benefit symbionts provide (Yoder and Tiffin 2017, below). This simple model may not fully reflect real -world dynamics, however \u2014 it models host sanctions and symbio nt effects on hosts as simple genetic effects rather than continuously varying quantitative traits, and limits the variation possible in the signals symbionts send to hosts. Demonstrating that host-symbiont signals maintain variation in symbiosis outcomes under more realistic circumstances can help understand how signaling shapes real -world outcomes in medical and agricultural systems. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 We will test the hypotheses that (a) host sanctions against less- helpful symbionts, modeled as a quantitative trait, can select for more cooperative symbionts and that (b) host recognition of symbiont signals, modeled as infinitely varying rather than as a simple genetic system, can maintain variation in host sanctioning ability and symbion t helpfulness. Methods \u2014 We will build and analyze a mathematical model of host -symbiont coevolution extending my earlier research (5), in which symbionts' effect on host fitness varies from negative (antagonistic) to beneficial (mutualistic), and hosts a re able to respond by sanctioning or rewarding symbionts. We will examine this model algebraically, and program a detailed computer simulation to test its dynamics. Student Roles \u2014 Students will learn to develop and analyze algebraic models of dynamic systems; write code for computer simulations and use the simulations to test hypotheses; and contribute to analysis, visualization, and presentation of model and simulation results. Expectations \u2014 Results from this project should be suitable for publication in internationally -recognized journals of ecology and evolution, such as the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , the American Naturalist , or Evolution .

Research Project Title \u2014 Structural Mechanisms of GPCR Signaling and Drug Discovery Background & Purpose \u2014 G protein -coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest superfamily of integral membrane proteins that help a cell to convert extracellular signals into multiple intracellular signali ng cascades. This critical role of GPCRs makes them therapeutic targets for ~40% of all modern drugs. Multiple signaling effects of GPCRs targeted by drugs can cause on -target side- effects, so a molecular understanding of GPCR function is essential for rat ional drug discovery to minimize those side -effects. The conformational flexibility of GPCRs plays a mechanistic role in their function, so the lab is focused on developing and applying methods in computational biochemistry, biophysics and bioinformatics t o provide this mechanistic link between receptor sequence and signaling. Visit Abrol lab's website (http://titin.abrol.csun.edu/abrollab/) for publications and more information. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 How do GPCRs exert their allosteric and pleiotropic effects in signal transduction? What is the structural basis of receptor -G protein selectivity and G protein vs beta arrestin selectivity? How do GPCR paralogs (products of gene duplication events activated by same/similar chemical signals) and other sequence variations map to GPCR function and pathophysiology? How can we utilize structural mechanisms for drug discovery? Method We are developing following methods to answer these questions: Method \u2014 1. Our previous conformational sampling algori thms are being combined with Markov State Models to identify physiological important conformations. Updated: March 2021 Page 62 of 76 2. We are combining evolutionary approaches with conformational methods to understand the evolution of GPCR structural plasticity and their functional diver gence. Methods are validated against available experimental data and then applied to interesting GPCR systems. Using results from our lab and other sources we have created a freely accessible GPCR Knowledgebase (http://www.gpcrkb.org). Student Roles \u2014 The students are trained in computational methods used in the lab and one programming language. After training, each student is assigned a project that they take full ownership of. They interact with me regularly and also with any experimental collaborator as an active participant. The students get to write the manuscripts for publication and they also get to present their research at one of the conferences listed below. Expectations \u2014 I have mentored many undergraduate STEM students (freshman to senior). The computational nature of our research enables both short and long term projects to be designed based on student interests. Our lab has a broad range of resources to get undergraduate s ready for research. The students learn about GPCR signaling, computational methods, programming, and using protein visualization/analysis tools. Students are not required to have any programming experience, however, they need to be open to learning some programming. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 GPCR -Keystone; CSUPERB.

I received Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Chemistry before moving into the field of Biochemistry at the University of Toronto where I completed a PhD in Biochemistry and Biomolecular Structure in the Forman -Kay lab. In 2003 I moved to Los Angeles to join the Mayo lab at Caltech for my postdoc. I started as a tenure -track faculty member at CSUN in 2007.

Crowhurst Lab \u2014 http://www.crowhurstlab.com/ Background & Purpose \u2014 The overarching goals of our research are to study the structure and function of proteins to better understand their mechanism of action and the specificity of their interactions with target proteins. This can lead to improved understanding of specific diseases, and may point toward more targeted therapies than are currently available. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 Of particular interest in the Crowhurst lab is HdeA, a protein that is largely responsible for the successful proliferation of dysentery, in that it aids in the surv ival of pathogenic bacteria as the organism travels through the stomach on its way to infect the intestines. Dysentery disproportionately impacts lower -income parts of the world; research in this area (that improves our understanding of the mechanism of Hd eA activity and might lead to therapies or vaccines) would therefore provide a valuable contribution towards reducing health disparities between different cultural groups. One of the very unique characteristics of HdeA is that it is inactive in its folded form and becomes activated only when it unfolds at the low pH of the stomach. This is in direct conflict with our traditional understan ding of how proteins function. Our primary aims with this project are to use high resolution techniques to investigate th e changes in structure and flexibility of HdeA with decreasing pH. This will shed light on fundamental protein folding questions and provide us with a better understanding of the mechanism by which the protein becomes activated. Method \u2014 The wetlab comp onent of our work primarily involves preparing protein samples for study. This includes recombinant protein expression and purification, as well as some DNA work. Our primary analytical tool is NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy, which permits s tudy of these proteins with atomic resolution. We have numerous specialty techniques such as preparing selectively and uniformly isotopically labeled proteins for NMR analysis, and we may also do some in- cell NMR experiments. Student Roles \u2014 Students will collect many different types of data with their protein samples using the NMR spectrometer. This can include data that provides information on structure, internal flexibility, binding with other proteins, and unfolding processes. Students will learn how to use specialized software for analyzing the data as well as spreadsheet programs for displaying the results. There may also be some computational component work involving molecular simulations t o better visualize our results. Expectations \u2014 Students in t he Crowhurst lab will learn many marketable and translatable skills, including wetlab skills (relating to the techniques and equipment required to make and purify proteins in advance of NMR studies), computer and analytical skills (in processing and interp reting NMR data), and the \"softer\" skills of learning to work with others, recover from setbacks, troubleshoot problems and present scientifi c data in front of an audience.

Ph.D. University of Washington, Seattle Background & Purpose \u2014 Dr. Fischhaber's group is investigating the protein biochemistry of DNA repair in S. cerevisiae (baker's yeast). In human beings, failure to repair covalent modifications to DNA (DNA damage) by the biologic repair pathways results in genetic mutations and cancer, particul arly skin cancer. DNA damage is ubiquitous in living cells and much of it is unavoidable, so DNA repair pat hways are crucial for survival. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 The spatial and temporal relationships of several important DSB Repair proteins from S. cerevisiae will be investigated in vivo using fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy data from the PI's laboratory demonstrate Rad10 is recruited to spatially localized I -SceI-induced DSBs RAD51 -, and SAW1 -dependent fashi on and required for the Synthesis -Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA) pathway. The proposed experiments will build on these findings by investigating the necessity of longer DNA flaps in the requirement of Saw1 for Rad10 recruitment to sites of Single -strand Annealing (SSA) and similarity between yeast and human Rad52 in downstream recruitment. These experiments will determine whether Saw1 and Rad10 recruitment to DSB sites is altered as a function of length of nonhomologous sequence flanking the DSB site. Method \u2014 The PI will create a panel of yeast strains in which the DNA region surrounding an inducible DNA Double - strand Break site is varied so that the amount of DNA between the DNA cut site and the DNA repeats is altered. The strains will be investigated for the ability to observe Rad10- YFP protein being recruited to the DSB site. The experiments will also determine whether yeast and human Rad52 are sufficiently similar that human Rad52 can recruit yeast Saw1 -Rad1 -Rad10 complexes during yeast DSB repair.

I supplemented this background with post -doctoral work in an organic lab pre paring synthetic analogs of oxidation enzymes. My work at CSUN includes the development of catalysts for pharmaceutically important hydroxylation and transfer hydrogenation reactions, preparation of trojan -horse anti -tumor agents, optimization of transition metal electrocatalysts for fuel- cells, and development of synthetic protocols for challenging heterocycle coupling reactions. Ph.D. 1993, California Institute of Technology. B.S. 1988, University of Utah Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 My research is pursuing two important goals: (1) the development of anti -tumor agents that better target tumors and avoid the traditional side -effects of chemotherapy and (2) the design of catalysts for pharmaceutically important reactions to reduce cost and improve drug safety. In project (1), we chemically attach nutrients (such as amino acids and sugars) to a cytotoxic core to make molecules that trick rapidly growing tumors into importing them. We test the toxicity of these new agents against tumor cell cultures an d explore the mechanism of cell death through specialized dyes. In project (2), we specifically prepare catalysts that collect and transfer hydrogen from alcohol solvents to pharmaceutical precursors. These catalysts are chemically modular allowing them to customized for the intended reactions. We hope to find design- to- selectivity rules that will make these catalysts generally useful in drug production. Student Roles \u2014 There are research opportunities in both projects. In project (1), you will have the opportunity to prepare new anti -tumor agents and test their toxicity. As part of this, you will learn to carry out simple air -sensitive organic reactions, culture cancer cells, and test cell viability with specialized dyes. In project (2), you will have th e chance to prepare ruthenium complexes, characterize them spectroscopically, and assess their catalytic activity and selectivity through test reactions and chromatographic analysis of the products. Updated: March 2021 Page 65 of 76 Expectations \u2014 Those who join my group will be trained by myself or fellow students in the techniques needed for the project. As your experience grows, you will have more independence in carrying experiments and eventually your own project. My group has biweekly group me etings to discuss research results and plans for the future. This is a good opportunity to become comfortable discussing your own work and results. I encourage all group members to yearly present their work at one or more local symposium or professional me eting such as CSUPERB or CSUNPosium. By graduation, you will have research and professional skills that will serve you well in a scientific or medical career. Publications \u2014 To view publications, visit my CSUN webpage . Jheem Medh Mentor Bio \u2014 My overall research interest is in the area of lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis. It is well known that abnormal plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels result in cardiovascular disease. We are interested in the molecular and cellular mechanisms that translate an anomalous lipoprotein profile into atherosclerotic lesions. We are studying various components of th e atherogenesis pathway including apolipoproteins, lipases and lipoprotein receptors. The current emphasis is on understanding cellular events that are unique to the vessel wall and may initiate lesion formation. Ph.D. 1990, University of Texas M.S. 1984, University of Bombay B.S. 1982, University of Bombay. Background & Purpose \u2014 The general purpose of our research activities is to understand tissue -specific metabolic activity in pathophysiological conditions such as diabetes and atherosclerosis. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 There are two main research projects in our laboratory. LPL and insulin sensitivity: This project is aimed at understanding the mechanisms and signaling pathways by which down - regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an e nzyme participating in fat metabolism, leads to improved insulin sensitivity in muscle cells. LPL and Cholesterol Efflux: A cholesterol transporter, ABCA1, reverses atherosclerosis by allowing the removal of cholesterol from cells lining the blood vessels (macrophages). This project aims to investigate how LPL inhibits the cholesterol efflux process. Method \u2014 Different cultured cells (muscle, adipose, macrophages, hepatocytes) will be treated with various chemicals and reagents at variable doses and times and various cellular responses, such as insulin sensitivity and cholesterol accumulation will be measured. Quantitative data will be collected to represent glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, cholesterol removal from cells. The data will be analyzed to com pare differences in metabolism between normal and abnormal cells. Excel spread sheets will be used to generate bar graphs an d plots to represent our data. Student Roles \u2014 Students at all levels will design wet experiments with cultured cells, perform the experiment, collect and process data and prepare images and figures for presentation/publication. Expectations \u2014 Students will learn experimental techniques, analytical skills, and the ability to communicate th eir research project and data. Students will b e co-authors on publications describing their work. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 All students usually attend the CSU -wide Biotechnology symposium held in January each year.

Background & Purpose \u2014 The development of cell -permeable sequence selective DNA -binding molecules is a crucial goal in the context of current approaches to disease therapy. Since the vast majority of cellular regulatory proteins interact with DNA primarily or exclusively in t he major groove, the preparation of major -groove binding ligands that can directly compete with these proteins for DNA binding sites is of paramount importance. However, no general paradigm currently exists for the design of sequence- specific major -groove binding small molecules. Updated: March 2021 Page 66 of 76 Method \u2014 This research project involves the synthesis and DNA binding affinity/sequence selectivity evaluation of a series of aryl -C,O-glycosides, molecules hypothesized to interact with the major groove of DNA. Student Roles \u2014 Students at the sophomore and junior levels will be introduced to the techniques of organic synthesis and then assigned specific chemical structure to prepare in the lab. Students at the senior level will also be involved in the analysis of the interaction of their synthetic compounds with DNA by spectroscopic (UV and fluorescence) techniques. Students may join this research project after having taking General Chemistry courses (Chem 101, 102 or equivalent). Expectations \u2014 The synthetic and spectroscopic techniques used in this research can be learned in the lab in hands -on fashion. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 American Chemistry Society National Meetings, Southern California ACS Meetings, and National Sigma Xi Student Research Symposium.

These methods will be applied to undertake efficient syntheses of complex naturally occurring molecules, particularly those with biological activity and potential use in medicine or medical research. One of Dr. Oh's goals is to develop and apply the hetero Diels- Alder reaction to natural product synthesis. The targets of his current interests are indole alkaloids, starting with ergot alkaloids, and histrionicotoxins. A nother project involves the development of chiral Lewis acids that can catalyze and induce asymmetry in organic transformations. The emphasis in on transformations that have been shown to be effective in the synthesis of complex natural products. Ph.D. 1985, University of Virginia B.S. 1980, Juniata College . Research Projects \u2014 Benzimidazole derived compounds are an important class of biologically active small molecules. Their inhibition of a variety of enzymes have made them the focus of anticancer, antiba cterial, anti- parasite, anti -fungal, anti -histamine, anti -malarial, analgesic, anti -viral (HIV), and as treatment and radiological probe for brain imagining particularly Alzheimer's among many other applications. One of the major problems of such an activ e drug is its tendency to have strong side effects; new variations of benzimidazole are constantly needed to develop better specificity and decreased side effect profiles. The biological activity arises from interactions with proteins or nucleic acids. Si nce DNA and proteins recognize chiral \"mirror image\" compounds, this can be used to either enhance or lower the biological effects. One potential way to increase the specificity of the biological effect is to modify the benzimidazole to incorporate a chir al center. We will explore incorporation of chiral axes to enhance the specificity of biological activity of these compounds. Our second project involves benzimidazolium compounds in chemistry of ionic liquids. Imidazolium ionic liquids have been found to possess unique properties that have the potential to solve many other chemical and pharmacological problems. Deeper investigations of Imidazolium ionic liquids are needed to improve drug discovery, (especially in asymmetric methods for synthesis of chiral drugs, catalysis, chiral additives for synthetic transformations), and to the field of biomolecule manipulation in ionic liquid systems. We will explore the synthesis of chiral atrope isomers based on imidazolium compounds capable of catalyzing various synthetic methods, investigate the mechanism that gives high stereoselectivites in ionic liquids at room temperature, and apply this method to asymm etric synthesis of biologically active compounds. Method \u2014 The overall analytic process involves several areas. The first is isolation and purification of compounds that are synthesized. For purification, we use the methods of chromatography and recrystall ization. For structural identification and dynamic investigations, we use spectroscopic techniques, especially nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and polarimetry. For examining the interactions with substrate compounds, NMR and e lectron pair resonance (EPR) are important. The most important part of the analysis is the structure- activity studies, which utilizes computational modeling. Student Roles \u2014 The students participate in research aspects relating to experimental design, sci entific inquiry, synthesis, and data analysis. Students will analyze the experimental data by relating structural/electronic configurations to changes in catalytic activity. Expectations \u2014 Students will develop a wide variety of skills in synthesis, method ology development, purification Updated: March 2021 Page 67 of 76 methods, use of sophisticated analytical instruments, designing -planning chemical research, laboratory safety, communication, and working in a team environment.

Jessica Vey ** NOT ACCEPTING NEW MENTEES FOR 2021-2022** Mentor Bio \u2014 Ph.D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. B.S. (Chemistry), Temple University, Philadelphia, PA. Title of Research Project \u2014 Enabling rational design of the biodesulfurization process: biochemical characterization of dibenzothiophene monooxygenase Background & Purpose \u2014 The Vey laboratory focuses on studying catalysis by selected flavin monooxygenases with the longer -term goal of rationally designing those monooxygenases to modify their substrate -binding properties. Our efforts will center on an ongoing research project in the lab that seeks to help develop bacterial biodesulfurization (BDS) as an industrially useful process for the desulfurization of crude oil. The long- term go al of this work is to produce an engineered BDS pathway capable of desulfurizing the majority of the refractory organosulfur compounds (ROCs) present in crude oil. Sulfur dioxide is an atmospheric pollutant generated by combustion of the sulfur that natura lly occurs in coal and petroleum. Sulfur is currently removed from crude oil by hydrodesulfurization, a costly technique that requires harsh reaction conditions. Certain refractory organosulfur compounds (ROCs) cannot be effectively treated in this manner4 . Researchers have identified several bacterial species that use a simple metabolic pathway to remove sulfur from specific ROCs5. This bacterial capability (biodesulfurization) could be exploited as an effective additional step to employ during the refinem ent process for generating low -sulfur fuels; however, several technical hurdles prevent industrial use of this environmentally friendly pathway. For example, the enzymes involved in biodesulfurization are too slow and too specific to effectively desulfuriz e the wide range of organosulfur compounds present in coal and oil. BDS will not be a viable industrial process until organisms are engineered to desulfurize a wide range of molecules6. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 To address this problem, we will examine the enzymes of the biodesulfurization pathway with the long- term goal of improving the enzymes' functional capabilities. We will first ensure that we have reliable methods to produce the four enzymes of the BDS pathway, and then we will establish methods to study the function of the enzymes using transient -state kinetics and surface plasmon resonance. With reliable methods in place, we will study how these enzymes work by strategically \"breaking\" them (using a proces s called site- directed mutagenesis) and observing whether or not our attempt to break the enzymes has impacted their function. Our results will help guide rational design of the BDS enzymes to improve their enzymatic rates and substrate specificities. Meth od \u2014 Recombinant DNA methods (PCR, subcloning, mutagenesis), recombinant protein expression and purification (E. coli culture, chromatographic purification methods), and a variety of biochemical characterization methods such as HPLC - or UV -Vis-based steady state enzyme activity assays, spectrophotometric titration, protein crystallization and protein X -ray crystallography. Student Roles \u2014 The specific methods each student uses depend on the specific project undertaken and the amount of progress made. Expectations \u2014 Students must maintain a clean and safe lab, keep accurate notes of experiments, and analyze and present their results. They will learn essential biochemical techniques, and will develop critical thinking and c ommunication skills.

Updated: March 2021 Page 68 of 76 Department of Physics & Astronomy Sattar Taheri Antibiotic resistance is an ever -growing global health problem. Over the years, bacteria managed to develop strategies to resist antibiotics, urging us to search for alternative antibacterial options. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are one of the candidates that hold promise fo r combatting the resistant bacteria. AMPs success in medicine, however, relies on new designs that are highly toxic for bacteria, yet, selective enough not to harm human cells. The difficulty is that we still lack a comprehensive understanding of their action mechanisms, which is needed to inspire new designs. My laboratory is utilizing an state -of-the-art imaging platform, named \"mother machine\", to study effects of AMPs on bacteria. We perform video microscopy on individual live bacteria that are treated with AMPs. We then use our custom -designed image -analysis software to extract quantitive information on the life patterns of thousands of bacteria under AMPs treatment. Our data reveal the dynamics of cell death and possible development of resistance in bacteria. Information of these types are only accessible in high -throu ghput single - cell experiments. The long -term goal of our laboratory is to leverage theoretical knowledge and modern experimental techniques to provide a framework to find ways to improve activity and selectivity of AMPs, such that they can be used to fight resistant bacteria. Previously, we developed theoretical models that provide experimentally -testable benchmarks on optimization of AMPs activity. For instance, AMPs activity is predicte d to be a function of its electric charge, being m aximum for charges around +4e. In the lab, students learn how to set up single -cell experiments. The trainings cover four technical areas: (1) standard bacterial culture techniques, (2) fabrication and ass embly of the mother machine, (3) time - lapse microscopy on live cells, and (4) analysis of the microscopy images. The interdisciplinary nature of my research program invites students from various departments. This includes students from College of Science and Mathematics who are interested in quantitative approaches to fundamental questions in biology, and also students from College of Engineering who are interested in technologies used in cutting -edge scientific research. The technical aspects of the rese arch projects cover tasks at various levels of difficulty. Students at different levels in their education (from freshman to graduate students) can have important contributions to our research proj ects. We publish the results of our research in physics, biology and interdisciplinary journals. Students' contribution will be major parts of our publications. Students' will also present posters and give talks in scientific meetings and conferences, including the meetings of the American Physical Society, Biop hysical Society, and American Society for Microbiology. Visit our website for information about our lab Anna Bezryadina Mentor Bio \u2014 Dr. Anna Bezryadina is an Assistant Professor at Physics and Astronomy Department, California State University Northridge (CSUN). Her research interests include bio - photonics, nonlinear optics, optical trapping and manipulation for biological applications, and microscopy. In 2005 she finished her B.S. degree in Physics and Applied Mathematics from San Francisco State University (SFSU). During her Ph.D. at University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) she investigates the reliability and degradation mechanisms in different types of solar cells. After receiving her Ph.D. in 2012, she had two postdocs. At SFSU she developed new optical trapping and manipulation tools to study microorganisms' interactions, as well as demonstrating first -of-a-kind biological waveguides. At the Univers ity of California San Diego (UCSD), she worked on video- speed super -resolution plasmonic structure illumination microscopy to study biological processes with resolution down to 50 nm. Updated: March 2021 Page 69 of 76 Research Lab :\"Quantum & Nonlinear Biophotonics\" Title of Research Project \u2014 \"Development of Bio-photonics Microchips.\" Purpose and Background \u2014 The central topic of the research is light interaction with microorganisms for engineering environmentally friendly bio-optical bio-compatible components for future quantum computers. The laboratory is utilizing optical trapping and biological waveguide formation to transmit light through otherwise highly -scatterin g and/or non-transparent media. Microorganisms in biological waveguides get attracted toward the center of the beam (the highest intensity) due to the optical gradient force. Since living cells usually have a slightly higher index of refraction than the ambient media, the laser beam self-traps due to a self-lensing effect along the beam path, which allows the formation of a biological \"fiber\". By choosing the unique biological properties of cells, the formed biological waveguide can be fixed and used as a structure for the first bio-optical circuits. The main goal is finding a way to grow and fix biological waveguides and structures, which will help to develop a new generation of biological interconnects, bio -optical microchips and biodegradable nanotechnology. Research Questions or Hypothesis 1) Establish optimal parameters of waveguide formation for different biological suspensions. 2) Develop a protocol for fixing biological waveguides 3) Confine waveguides to substrates and other entities. 4) Generate the first simple network of bio-optical waveguides. Method \u2014 This is experimental bio-photonics laboratory, so students will do primarily experimental work. To grow bacteria cultures and prepare biological samples, in the lab students will have an access to biological benches, a fumehood, an incubator, and other biological preparation equipment. To study waveguide formation, students will use multiple high -power CW lasers (green, blue, and, tunable NIR Ti-Sapphire laser), beam detectors/ cameras, a microscop e system, an optical trapping system, and other necessary optical equipment. By creating a waveguide and holding bacteria in a waveguide under the microscope, students will be able to observe how cells respond to environmental cues on individual and colony levels. By simple fabrication of a microfluidic chamber on top of a microscope slides and by delivering a laser beam from a side with a fiber, students will be able to assemble the first simple bio-optical circuits inside the microfluidic chamber. Student Roles \u2014 Since basic research concepts are relatively easy to understand, students at different levels (from freshman to graduate students) and almost no background in physics or biology can participate and meaningfully contribution to the research. After several months of primary training, students will be able to perform bio-photonic experiments by themselves. The training cover four technical areas: 1) laser alignment and laser safety; 2) standard bacteria cultures techniques and bio -sample preparation; 3) imaging under the microscope with optical trapping; 4) data and image analysis. After finishing basic training, students will have a choice to do more biological studies (grow and preparation samples, use laser set-up for image bio-samples), laser stud ies (align and make new laser set-up, use laser set- up for image bio-samples), or both. Expectations \u2014 New undergraduate students will usually work together with senior students from the group or with PI directly, where they can perform his/her independent part of sub-project and receive primary training in experimental optics and biosample preparation. As students get comfortable with what they are doing, PI encourages them to develop their own projects. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 The major confere nces are SPIE: Optics + Photonics meeting in August, Conference on Lasers and Electro -Optics meeting in May-June, and Biophotonics Congress in April (once in two years) by Optics Society of America. Students are strongly encouraged to give an oral presentation or poster at least once a year.

Title of Research Project - Automated Video- Analysis of Behavior Quantification on Human Odor by Mosquitoes Background & Purpose - Mosquitoes and other blood- feeding insects are considered one of the most dangerous creatures on the planet because of their ability to spread deadly diseases. Biologists are trying to find solutions to prevent, control or treat these diseases. Mosquitoes host seeking behavior is important, as it is at the core of the processes involved in the contact between a fly and a human. In laboratory conditions, it is easy to have thousands of mosquitoes under different experimental conditions. One of these experiments aims to discover the reaction of mosquitoes around different odors, for which a special environment is created. These experiments were performed with mosquitoes held in cages with a glass top. A human arm was inserted in a glove containing a window covered with a double -layer of netting. Attraction towards the arm was measured using video recordings, which was done through the glass top. The count of the mosquitoes is used to describe the interest of the mosquitoes to each odor. The current manual analysis on these videos is not sufficient for quantitative analysis and available object counting approaches do not work well. The proposed research project is about creatin g an automated object counting method for counting mosquitoes captured in video. The results of this study would be of considerable biological importance. Method - In this research we are creating automated video analysis software that can count mosquitoes from videos. The framework of the software is going to be comprised of several modules, which are; finding ROI (Region of Interest in each frame of the video), training and testing of a classifier to detect mosquitoes. The proposed framework will design mosquito feature to get the best classification results. Student Roles - Students will get to work on a STEM research project, which blends biology, technology and mathematics. Students will target good conferences and journals in computer science and image processing Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering Bruno Osorno Mentor Bio \u2014I have been running projects on this campus for many years, and I am getting into the 9th year of a mentoring program at the College of Engineering and Computer Science.

Research Question(s) or Hypothesis\u2014Exposure to ele ctromagnetic fields has been discussed in the literature as a source of cancer. We intent to analyze magnetic fields' strengths related to voltage. Furthermore, this research might lead to the study of environmental impacts on carbon dioxide reduction and its impact on health. Method \u2014 The proposed research requires use of quantitative research methods. My background in engineering will allow me to deal with software and hardware as needed to carry on this research. An extensive literature review will be necessary to focus on the exact approach for this research.

In addition, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Yale School of Medicine under the American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2015. Professor Valdovinos has expertise is in the design of circulatory support medical devices for adult and pediatric heart failure patients. In his three years at CSUN, Professor Valdovinos has supervised a various senior design teams and served as a mentor for students participating in programs like BUILD PODER and AIMS2. Professor Valdovinos also serves as the faculty mentor for the CSUN Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) and as a board member of the Diversity Committee for the Biomedi cal Engineering Society. Ph.D. 2014, University of California Los Angeles M.S. 2010, University of California Los Angeles B.S. 2009, University of Southern California . Background & Purpose \u2014 There have been great advancements in the design and implantability of medical devices that can monitor and assist patients with various cardiovascular diseases. While the miniaturization of electronics has enabled these medical technologies to become full y implantable, their lifespan is still limited by the batteries that power them. Often, batteries necessitate eventual re- operation to replace the unpowered devices. The focus of my research at California State University, Northridge is on the development of wireless powering technologies that can improve the implantability of therapeutic cardiovascular devices. This entails utilizing traditional radio -frequency (RF) electrical systems (also known as transcutaneous energy transfer systems, TETs) as well as integrating the use of smart material like piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials to miniaturize and power implantable medical devices. Research Projects \u2014 My research will focus on two thrusts. The first thrust focuses on powering traditionally low -power cardiovascular devices like pacemakers and other stimulators with magnetoelectric structures (essentially piezoelectric and magnetostrictive composites). This technology will allow for miniaturized receivers that can extract power from an outer tran smitter to recharge or continuously power these small Updated: March 2021 Page 72 of 76 devices without sacrificing their small foot print. Magnetoelectric receivers can accomplish this because of their large energy density and excellent coupling between piezoelectri c and magnetostrictive phases. The second thrust will focus on improving the wireless technology for powering higher -power devices like blood pumps for patients with heart failure. The aim of this thrust is to improve current close range wireless powering systems to achiev e higher efficiency and longer range for powering the device. This can have implications on the development of intravascular blood pumps that can eventually be continuously recharged or powered. This will be achieved by utilizing ferromagnetic materials like Me tlgas to increase the efficiency and coupling between a receiving ant enna and transmitting antenna. Student Roles \u2014 Undergraduate students will play a key role in these projects. As sophomores, students will learn about real-world applications of classes they have taken like ECE 240 (Fundamentals of EE). During this time, students will get familiar with the research pro cess, including literature reviews, keeping a laboratory notebook, contributing to group discussions/collaborations and using design software like Cadence and COMSOL Multiphysics. They will also gain some familiarity with the equipment that is used in the lab. I have access to the Printed Circuit Board Lab (JD 1564), which houses my 3D printer (for prototyping) and other equipment like pediatric blood pump, Metglas magnetic core ribbon, and electrical measuring equipment. During their Junior and Senior year s, students will be involved in designing and prototyping devices and test rigs as well as planning and carrying out experiments.

Research Projects : (1) Numerical Inv estigation of Transport through Biological Media (2) Cooling of Biomedical Devices Employing Conductive Porous Substrates Research Lab - Thermofluid Research and Design Lab Background & Purpose - Biohe at transfer is the study of heat transfer through biological tissue. It is one of the important research topics to understand how heat penetrates through tissues and organs during medical thermal therapeutic applications. Knowing accurate temperature distr ibution within tissues and organ provides a great opportunity to avoid any damages to healthy tissues and to develop new medical devices or treatments to reduce the pain and side effects. One of the principal issues in medical thermal therapeutic applicati ons, such as hyperthermia cancer treatment, is to properly predict temperature variation within biological tissues and body organs subjected to thermal treatment. Hyperthermia treatment is one of the four main cancer therapy techniques following surgery, c hemotherapy, and radiation techniques. In hyperthermia, the tumor cells will be overheated to a high value of around 40-45 \u00b0C to kill or damage the cancer cells. There are different techniques to provide heat in hyperthermia cancer treatment, including mic rowave ablation (MWA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), ultrasound, hot water blankets, and thermal chambers. In this work, modeling of bioheat transport through the tissue/organ will be carried out during microwave and radiofrequency ablation process. The effects of several parameters such as applied hyperthermia heat flux intensity, volume fraction of the vascular space, blood and tissue matrix thermal conductivities, tissue matrix permeability and size, blood pressure and velocity and metabolic heat genera tion on blood and tissue phase temperatures and thermal Updated: March 2021 Page 74 of 76 transport during the treatment will be investigated. In addition, heat transfer in biomedical devices and in advanced heat management devices for cooling of biomedical devices will be investigated. Research Questions or Hypothesis - A principal issue in medical thermal therapeutic applications, such as hyperthermia treatment, is modeling and understanding the heat transport and temperature variation within biological tissues and body organs. Biologic al media generally consist of cells, blood vessels, and interstitial space that categorize as vascular and extra- vascular regions. Biological structure can be modeled as a porous matrix, including cells and interstitial space, called tissue in which the b lood flows through. Utilizing the porous media theory, non -thermal equilibrium between the blood and the tissue is addressed and the blood- tissue convective heat exchange is taken into account. In this work, numerical modeling will be performed utilizing C FD (computational fluid dynamic) commercial software. Both local thermal non -equilibrium and local thermal equilibrium models in porous media will be employed in the studies. Experimental and numerical studies are also performed to develop cooling techniques for biomedical devices. Method - Commercial CFD software such as ANYSY FLUENT will be employed for numerical modeling and advanced techniques in porous media will be utilized. In addition, experimental and numerical studies are performed for development of cooling techniques for biomedical devices. Student Roles - The sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduate students may assist the graduate students and the PI for developing the experimental set -up, performing experimental measurements, data collectio n, and post-processing of data while doing literature review, getting involve in numerical simulations and preparing the reports and papers. Expectations - Enthusiastic students interested in thermofluids sciences, bioheat transfer and cooling of biomedica l devices are encouraged to join the lab to perform hands on experimental or computational thermofluid projects. Undergraduate students can gain research experience and assist graduate students to perform research and have research publications or conference presentations. The students should follow all lab regulations and be responsible, on time, self motivated, honest, detail oriented, good listener and reader, and should collaborate properly with other students.

These peaks due to dysfunctional fee dback system from their mechanoreceptors may lead to complex problems such as amputation if they are not identified and treated in timely manner. Our main objective is to protect the foot by sensing these abnormal peaks and redistribute the pressure fr om e xcessive pressure regions. Research Question(s) or Hypothesis \u2014 The foot anatomy and its mechanical loading effects the loading pattern which is very critical to determine the pressure distribution. The research is to create a study of anatomy, and connec t the analysis to the foot pressure distribution. The main goal is: Measurement of the plantar pressure and shear forces actively using foot insert and examine the interrelationship of these forces. Method \u2014 In this research we are developing a design pro totype for an adaptable shoe insert useful for diabetic foot care and comparing to the existent diabetic foot wears. The proposed design will consider human anatomy and anthropometry of the foot to properly sense the sensory regions during standing and wal king. The developed design will be evaluated to the existent diabetic foot care available to val idate and for market analysis. Student Roles \u2014 This research will include the pros and cons of the existent technology. It is indeed an STEM multi - disciplinary research opportunity, which gives our undergraduate students a good knowledge and experience of how to integrate the science (biology, physics), technology, engineering and mathematics fundamentals into a biomechanical footwear design for diabetic foot ca re. The students who are in junior level with understanding of system design and modeling will get a hands -on experience developing and simulating a real world biomedical problem. This will not only help them understand how to relate the mechanical design concepts into biomedical modeling but also use modern computing tools such as Solid works and Matlab to simulate and show the pressure pattern. Expectations \u2014 The students will get an opportunity to present in such organizations giving them a great opport unity to connect with the scientific network. The results will also be published in poster to share the research with the CSUN community. The primary deliverable will be a comprehensive report that provides the detailed design, mo deling, and simulation res ults. Conferences Typically Attended \u2014 The research results will be disseminated to promote the findings to peer reviewed conference proceedings and journals in American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) societies.
