Crystals are programmed and charged prior to being placed on or around the body enabling the energy field that emanates from the crystals that can heal your body, mind and soul. Crystals heal through their presence, they do not enter the body - they simply are placed in particular areas to balance the chakras and promote healing of the whole person. Crystal healing helps bring about subtle changes through easing physical and mental pain, relieving emotional stress and bringing clarity to thoughts. At Hypnotherapy-Rotherham we offer deep whole body healing and use crystals to balance the chakras. A crystal chakra balance treatment will heal not only the body but the aura too, leaving you feeling invigorated and refreshed. THE SESSION The session will take up to one hour and you will remain fully clothed at all times. After completing a consultation and signing for permission for the therapist to work with you, you will be asked to lie on the therapy couch, however if you are not able to do this - you may sit in a comfortable chair. The therapist will use a pendulum to help identify chakras that are blocked, sluggish or not spinning in the correct way. You will be asked to either hold appropriate crystals in your hands or they will be placed upon your body. For specific areas, crystal wands may be used to aid the healing process. You will remain awake throughout and the therapist will ask you questions pertinent to the healing process, if a crystal is too powerful the therapist will remove it and replace it with an alternative. The therapist will commence at the root chakra and work up the body to the crown chakra at the top of the head. She will also conduct an aura cleansing to remove any negative energies that may have been released during the session.
