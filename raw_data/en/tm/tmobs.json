Hospital workers often get less than the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep per night and may need to work around-the-clock hours. Increased demand on healthcare systems will alter schedules further. Sleep and circadian disruption can have negative health and safety consequences including impaired immune function and increased accidents and errors. Sleep is a tool that you can utilize to help your body fight off infection, maintain health and perform at its best, which will have a positive impact on the health and well-being of your patients. As a hospital worker, you can take steps to ensure healthy sleep from the moment you wake up by following the guidelines below: Make Sleep a Priority Upon waking, get at least 15-60 minutes of bright light. Natural sunlight is best, or any bright or blue- enriched light source (e.g., light box, bright indoor lights). This signals to your biological clock that it's time to start the day. Exercising closer to wake-time can signal daytime and improve sleep quality . Avoid intense exercise close to b edtime and when you are sick. Take naps and consider \"banking\" your sleep. Even short naps (<20 minutes) can improve alertness, performance, and memory. Longer naps (>60 minutes)or extending sleep can make up for lost sleep or prepare you for anticipated sleep loss with a difficult shift. Use caffeine judiciously . It can help keep you awake when tired, but those effects remain for hours and can interfere with your ability to fall sleep. Therefore, try not to consume caffeine within ~6 hours of your desired bedtime. Also, caffeine may become less effective when consumed too often, which means it won't be as useful at times when you really need it. Limit alcohol before bed . It may be sedating at first, but i t disrupts your sleep quality. Keep a regular sleep and wake-time schedule as much as possible, even on your days off. This helps keep your sleep and circadian systems in sync and minimizes a p hysiological \"jet-lag. \" Create a regular bedtime routine of quiet activities, like taking a warm shower, reading, brushing your teeth and ending with relaxation exercises, to get your mind and b ody ready for sleep. Limit alerting activities close to bedtime , especially lig ht (e.g., screens), caffeine, exercise & work. Optimize your sleep environment. Keep it DARK, cool, quiet & comfortable. Use eye masks or dark-out curtains, and turn your screens off to foster a biological night.

Pharmacies may be closed or their supply chains interrupted, resulting in patients not receiving their medications. Problems with transportation infrastructure may make it difficult to get to appointments. Loss of hospitals and care facilities. Many chronically mentally ill live in supported environments, including psychiatric hospitals or other skilled facilities, group homes or shelters. In the aftermath of a disaster, these facilities may close or be understaffed; residents may be f orced to either relocate and/or be underserved. Increased demand for mental health services. Demand for mental health services often increases inthe wake of a disaster due to the mass trauma that has occurred. This greater need for services for many new people may result in a diversion of resources away from care for the chronically mentally ill. Disaster prepar edness and planning. Assist those with chronic mental illness and their families to develop a disaster plan including emergency contact i nformation a nd a supply of m edications. Identify group residences and shelters that house serious and chronically mentally ill persons in order to facilitate evacuation, rescue or safety check at the time of a disaster. 6This information is also available online at opss.org/article/ nutrition-and-dietary-supplements-immunity . STAY FUELED AND WELL HYDRATED Drink water! VITAMIN C Buffered L-ascorbate (1,000-5,000 mg), divided throughout the day, can be used to boost your im-mune system. As a powerful natural anti-oxidant and anti-viral, vitamin C can help protect you when you're under stressful conditions. Goats and other animals that make their own vitamin C can make up to 13 times their normal amount when under stress. VITAMIN D Vitamin D (400-4,000 IU) is especially important when you can't go outside into the sunshine. Vita-min D can strengthen your immune system and help reduce the rates of respiratory infections (400 IU is likely the maximal dose for children). It is important to note that, across the nation and among Military Service Members, blood vitamin D levels are typically below the recommended levels. Upper limits of intake are controversial, but 4,000 IU is reasonable. ZINC Zinc (20-30 mg) is essential for optimum immune function. Zinc supplementation might protect against respiratory tract infections, so it can only help at this time. The upper limit for zinc is 40 mg.MAGNESIUM Magnesium (200 mg)\u2014as magnesium citrate, glycinate, participates many immune-response pathways. Also, magnesium helps maintain an optium pH balance, which helps protect cells from viral invasion. Average magnesium intakes across the country are less than recommended, so supplemental magnesium can only help. The upper limit for supplemental magnesium is 350 mg. MULTIVITAMINS Taking a multivitamin can be useful when you aren't eating a well-balanced diet. Multivitamins often contain vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and magnesium, so it's important to check how much of each nutrient is in a product. If you combine a multivitamin with a single-nutrient supplement, make sure the combined amount of each ingredient doesn't exceed daily upper limits. (Look for %DV on the label.) We also suggest you look for a product that has been third-party certified by NSF or verified by USP. Remember: More isn't necessarily better\u2014and might be worse! And avoid taking other supplements you don't normally use. HOPE for those on the COVID-19 frontline HONESTY | O PTIMISM | P ROFESSIONALISM | E MPATHY NUTRITION & DIETARY SUPPLEMENT SUGGESTIONS TO SUPPORT IMMUNITY 7COVID-19 Getting good sleep is essential for both physical and emotional healing. While sleep is often disrupted following a stressful event (like being dispersed and providing care during a pandemic), there are strategies to help you get back on track. Practicing good sleep hygiene now may help you avoid larger health problems later. Get back to a regular sleep schedule. Maintain a consistent wake and bed time. You may not feel entirely rested in the morning initially, but resist the urge to lounge i n bed or doze. Keeping a consistent schedule helps your body r eset it s circadian rh ythm. If you can, avoid naps as you readjust to your regular schedule. If you must nap to avoid fatigue on the job, limit it to 30 minutes or less. Be careful with your caffeine intake. Avoid the urge to increase your caffeine use and stop drinking it after lunch. The half-life of caffeine is 5-6 hours and can therefore i mpact your sleep even 10 hours after you last ingested i t. Be mindful of drinking alcohol. It's a good idea to keep an eye on alcohol use after any stressful event, and i t's important to recognize that it can disrupt your sleep hours after you drink it. Although some people find that alcohol helps them fall asleep faster, the quality of your sleep suffers as the al cohol is metabolized. Stay within healthy guidelines for alcohol consumption and avoid drinking after dinner to reduce the impact of alcohol on your s leep. Exercise can both reduce stress and contribute to healthy sleep. Initiate or return to a regular exercise routine as part of your healthy lifestyle, whether that includes yoga, jogging, or tai chi. But be mindful of your timing: avoid exercising within 2-3 hours of bedtime, as it will increase your core body temperature and interfere with good sleep. Develop a wind- down routine. Devote the last 2 hours of your day to relaxing and preparing for bed. Discontinue activating behaviors such as watching the news or reviewing finances. Instead watch a comedy or practice a relaxation exercise. Develop a nightly routine that includes things like brushing your teeth, activating the \"do not disturb\" feature on your phone, and/or changing into pajamas. Having a nightly routine will train your mind a nd b ody t o prepare f or sleep. Don't worry in bed. In the weeks i mmediately following a stressful event, i t's normal to feel anxious and revisit the event. Allow yourself to process those thoughts and feelings, but avoid doing so in bed. Over time, this will condition you to feel and think anxiously in bed. Only get in bed when you're ready to sleep, and get out of bed if you are feeling anxious or stressed. Practice a relaxation exercise before you get back into bed. Allo w yourself some time to process your experience and readjust to your \"normal\" life. Remember that it's common to feel on edge for a few weeks after a stressful event and don't judge or criticize yourself for this. But if you continue to experience t rouble sleeping for more than a few weeks, reach out to your medical provider for help.

Since the highly lethal pandemic outbreak of influenza in 1918, there have been few global threats from infectious agents. SARS outbreaks in Asia and Canada, as well as H1N1, MERS, Ebola virus and Zika virus have provided important lessons to inform preparedness and response. Like many crisis and disaster events, pandemics result in a predictable range of distress reactions (insomnia, decreased perceptions of safety, anxiety), health risk behaviors (increased use of alcohol and tobacco, work/life imbalance manifested by extreme over-dedication in the workplace to alleviate distress), and may also result in psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Infectious outbreaks have unique characteristics that increase fear and uncertainty, due to the imperceptibility of the infectious agent, uncertainty about infection, and early stage symptoms that are often easily mistaken for more well-known, benign illnesses. As a result, pandemics manifest unique individual and community responses, including scapegoating and blaming, fear of infection, and high levels of somatic (physical) symptoms. Community response to outbreaks is governed by perception of risk (not actual risk) with a variety of factors impacting community distress, including: fear of infection, concerns about adequate supplies and efficacy of prophylactic and treatment medications, and the emergence of pathogens that are difficult to detect or treat, spread in novel ways, or cause unfamiliar or extreme symptoms will increase community distress. Most large-scale community disasters result in predictable phases of community behavior that unfold over time. After an event such as an earthquake or hurricane, community members typically come together to help with rescue efforts and bond over the shared adversity caused by the catastrophe. This \"honeymoon\" phase is often helpful for people to begin the process of recovery. In contrast, recommendations during infectious outbreaks include avoiding public places, social distancing, limiting contact with potentially infected individuals and other measures that diminish social connections and amplify feelings of isolation. In some cases, the requirement for quarantine furthers feelings of isolation for individuals directly effected as well as their families, friends, and community members. Front-line health workers are particularly vulnerable to negative mental health effects of treating outbreak victims, and may experience high levels of traumatic stress reactions, including depression, anxiety, hostility and somatization symptoms. They are directly exposed to the illness and resultant community distress, typically working long hours due to high rates of patients presenting compounded by illness in some providers, and the need to balance the duty to care for patients with concerns about their own well-being and that of their family and friends. Effective public mental health measures will address numerous areas of potential distress, health risk behaviors, and psychiatric disease. In anticipation of significant disruption and loss, promoting health protective behaviors and health response behaviors will be imperative. Areas of special attention include: (1) the role of risk communication; (2) the role of safety communication through public/private collaboration; (3) psychological, emotional, and behavioral responses to public education, public health surveillance and early detection efforts; (4) psychological responses to community containment strategies (quarantine, movement restrictions, school/work/other community closures); (5) health care service surge and continuity; and (6) responses to mass prophylaxis strategies using vaccines and antiviral medication. The first step in pre venting undesirable psychological, emotional, and behavioral response is an effective public health program of risk assessment and communication, public health prevention, and consequence management. These Mental Health and Behavioral Guidelines for Preparedness and Response to Coronavirus and other Emerging Infectious Outbreaks Community response to outbreaks is governed by perception of risk (not actual risk) with a variety of factors impacting community distress... 10are necessarily premised on having effective political and community leadership, appropriate pre-event organization, and staffing and funding. Being alert to the interrelationship between psychological, emotional, and behavioral responses and their effect on other elements of the response plan must also be emphasized. While planning can be based on assumptions that public health efforts to stop an outbreak will be successful, the importance of managing the consequences of failure and the subsequent behavioral response to failure is crucial. This can extend from failure to deliver support and services, to failure of a vaccine to prevent illness, to failure of therapies to work. Recommended steps in response to a pandemic flu outbreak are divided into four phases: preparedness, early outbreak response, later response and recovery, and mental health intervention planning. PREPAREDNESS 1. Education. Public education must begin immediately, before a pandemic occurs, and be embed into existing disaster public education campaigns, resources, and initiatives (e.g. HLS's www.ready.gov , Red Cross, CDC public education flu/p andemic-resources/planning-preparedness/national- strategy-planning.html, and HHS https://www.cdc.gov/ flu/pandemic-resources/index.htm). This should focus on facts, to include what is known, what is not known, and how individuals, communities, and organizations can prepare for a potential outbreak. As we know from the SARS and other outbreaks, public education impacts threat awareness, threat assessment, and preparedness behaviors in every phase of an event. Public education in advance of an outbreak should be inclusive of the varying degree of threats, to include those of reasonably low t hreat potential to those with the highest potential. 2.Leadership preparation. Leadership preparation includes ensuring that public officials understand which members of the population will be most vulnerable and who will need the highest level of health services, including mental health services. This includes identification of those groups who may be at greatest risk for problems related to contagion, such as those with psychiatric illness, children, elderly, homeless, and those with losses. Ongoing negative life events also increase one's risk for mental health for negative mental health impact of an outbreak. In addition, health risk behaviors such as smoking, drug use, and alcohol use may increase in times of stress, putting some people at increased risk. 3.Sustaining preparedness measures. Maintenance of motivation, capital assets, equipment, and funding to continue preparedness efforts over the long term must be considered, not just to focus on immediate needs. It is also important to remember that if responses are under- supported and fail, the community anger and lowered morale may complicate the ability of a community torespond to an outbreak, as well as the recovery process once an outbreak has ended. 4.Leadership functions. Leadership functions require identification of community leaders, spokespersons, and natural emergent leaders who can affect community model protective health behaviors. Special attention to the workplace is imperative as corporations have public education resources to potentially reach large populations. The media and celebrity groups constitute important leaders in most modern societies and have a critical role in providing leadership in communication. EARLY PANDEMIC RESPONSE 1.Communication. Wide dissemination of uncomplicated, empathically informed information on normal stress reactions can serve to normalize reactions and emphasize hope, resilience, and natural recovery. Recommendations to prevent exposure, infection, or halt disease transmission will be met with skepticism, hope, and fear. These responses will vary based on the individuals' and the local community's past experiences with government agencies. In addition, compliance with recommendations for vaccination or medication treatment or prophylaxis will vary greatly and will not be complete. The media can either amplify skepticism or promote a collaborative approach. Interactions with the media will be both challenging and critical. The public must clearly and repeatedly be informed about the rationale and mechanism for distribution of limited supplies (e.g., prophylactic or treatment medications). Leadership must adhere to policies regarding such distribution, as abuses of policy will undercut public safety and public adherence to other g overnment risk reduction recommendations. 2.Tipping points. Certain events, known as 'tipping points', will occur that can dramatically increase or decrease fear and helpful or health risk behaviors. Deaths of important or particularly vulnerable individuals (e.g., children), new unexpected and unknown risk factors, and shortages of treatments are typical tipping points. The behavioral importance of community rituals (e.g. speeches, memorial services, funerals, collection campaigns, television specials) are important tools for managing the community wide di stress and loss. 3.Surges in demands for health care. Those who believe they have exposed (but have not actually been) may outnumber those exposed and may quickly overwhelm a community's medical response capacity. Planning for the psychological and behavioral responses of the health demand surge, the community responses to shortages, and the early behavioral interventions after identification of the pandemic and prior to availability of vaccines are important public health preparedness activities. LATER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY 1.Community structure. Maintenance of community 11Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress Department of PsychiatryUniformed Services University4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799www.CSTSonline.orgis important. Community social supports \u2014 formal and informal \u2014 will remain important. In-person social supports may be hampered by the need to limit movement or contact due to concerns of contagion. Virtual contact \u2014 via phone, web, and other remote resources \u2014 will be particularly important at these times. At other times local gathering places \u2014 places of worship, schools, post offices, and grocery stores \u2014 could be points of access for education, training and distribution. In as much as allowed, instilling a sense of normalcy could be effective in fostering resiliency. In addition, observing rituals and engaging in regular activities (such Providing tasks for community action can supplement needed work resources, decrease helplessness and instill optimism. Maintenance and organization in order to keep families and members of a community together is important (especially in event of relocation). 2.Stigma and discrimination. Under conditions of continuing threat, the management of ongoing racial and social conflicts in the immediate response period and during recovery takes on added significance. Stigma and discrimination may marginalize and isolate certain groups, thereby impeding recovery. 3.Management of fata lities. Mass fatality and management of bodies, as well as community responses to this, must b e p lanned for. Containment measures related to bodies ma y a lso be in conflict with religious beliefs, rituals of burial , a nd the usual process of grieving. Local officials shou ld b e aware of the potential negative impact of disruptin g n ormal funeral rituals and processes of grieving in or der t o take safety precautions. Public health announcemen ts s hould include (if known) how long the virus remain s in t he corpse and what should be done with the bodies. I n a p andemic, funeral resources can be overwhelmed an d m ortuaries may not want to handle contaminated bo dies. C areful identification of bodies must be ensured an d a ppropriate, and accurate records maintained. MENTAL HEAL TH INTERVENTION PLANNING 1.Efforts to increase health protective behaviors and response behaviors. Individuals under stress will needreminders to take care of their own health and limitpotentially harmful behaviors. This will include takingmedication, giving medications to elderly and children,infection prevention measures, and when to go forvaccination. 2.Good risk communication following riskcommunication principles. The media can eitheramplify skepticism or promote a collaborative approach. Interactions with the media will be both critical and challenging. 3.Good safety communication. Promoting clear, simple,and easy-to-do measures can be effective in helpingindividuals protect themselves and their families. 4.Public education. Educating the public not only informsand prepares, it enlists them as partners in the process andplan. Education and communications will need to addressfears of contagion, danger to family and pets and mistrustof authority and government. The tendency to expect oract as if these are not present can delay community widehealth protective behaviors. 5.Facilitating community directed efforts. By organizingcommunal needs and directing action toward tangiblegoals, this will help foster the inherent communityresiliency toward recovery. 6.Utilizing evidence-informed principles of psychologicalfirst aid. These basic principles include: x Establish safety; identify safe areas and behaviors. Provide accurate and updated information. x Maximize individuals' ability to care for self and family and provide measures that allow individuals and families to be successful in their efforts. x Teach calming skills and maintenance of natural body rhythms (e.g., nutrition, sleep, rest, exercise). Limit exposure to traditional and social media as increased use enhances distress. xMaximize and facilitate connectedness to family and other social supports to the extent possible (this may require electronic rather than physical presence). x Foster hope and optimism while not denying risk. Encourage activities that restore a sense of normalcy. 7.Care for responders and healthcare workers to maintaintheir function and workplace presence. This will requireassistance to ensure the safety and care of their families.First responders will be comprised of a diverse population,to include medically trained personnel to bystanderswith no experience. Healthcare personnel will experienceincreased stress while having to manage concerns abouttheir own safety and, potentially, stigma from family,friends and neighbors. 8.Mental health surveillance. Ongoing population levelestimates of mental health problems in order to directservices and funding. Surveillance should addressPTSD, depression and altered substance use as well aspsychosocial needs (e.g., housing, transportation, schools,employment) and loss of critical infrastructure necessaryto sustaining community function. 12CSTS | Department of Psychiatry | Uniformed Services University | 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799 | www.CSTSonline.org Continued Described here are the psychological effects of quarantine, as well as strategies for how healthcare providers can care for their patients' and their own mental well-being during periods of quarantine. Psychological Effects of Quarantine During the Coronavirus Outbreak: What Healthcare Providers Need to Know Quarantine is defined as the separation of individuals who may have been exposed to an infectious disease from the rest of the population to determine if they are ill and to reduce their risk of infecting others. During the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, quarantine has been used as a public health strategy to reduce disease transmission. COVID-19 quarantine efforts have ranged from the mass quarantine of entire cities in China, to isolation in government-run facilities, to self-isolation at home. While quarantine can broadly serve the public good, it is also associated with psychological challenges for those quarantined, their loved ones, and the healthcare workers caring for them. Described here are the psychological effects of quarantine, as well as strategies for how healthcare providers can care for their patients' and their own mental well-being during periods of quarantine. Stressors of Quarantine and their Psychological EffectsStressors during quarantine include: 1.Frustration and boredom related to the isolation of quarantine , which involves loss of one's usual routine (e.g., regular home and work activities, shopping fornecessities) and limited social and physical contact withothers. 2.Inadequate supplies and access to regular medicalcare , including food, water, or change of clothes as well as masks, prescriptions, and thermometers. 3.Insufficient information, such as lack of, or delayed,information from public health authorities, often dueto poor coordination among health and governmentofficials; unclear guidance; confusion about reasons forquarantine; and perceived lack of transparency. 4.Longer durations of quarantine (i.e., 10 days orlonger), as well as extension of quarantine length. 5.Fears about becoming infected and/or infectingothers, which can manifest as increased attention to andworry about one's health and physical symptoms, andmay be particularly concerning for pregnant womenand parents of young children.Stressors following quarantine include: 1.Financial loss. Absence from work, healthcare costs, and other unanticipated financial burdens can result insocioeconomic distress, particularly among those withlower incomes. 2.Stigma from others. Stigmatization and rejectionby neighbors, co-workers, friends, and even familymembers can manifest as being treated differently orwith fear and suspicion, being avoided or excluded fromleisure, workplace, or school activities, and experiencingstigmatizing comments. Stigma can be exacerbated ifquarantined individuals are members of a particularethnic or religious group. 3.Getting back to one's \"normal\" routine. Returning tousual work and social routines may take anywhere fromseveral days to several weeks or even months. Knowingthat it might take time to get back into regular routinescan help with concern, anxiety, and frustration. Promoting Psychological Wellbeing During Quarantine 1.Use communication as an intervention. Clear, understandable, and practical communication canreduce adverse psychological responses and increasebehavioral adherence. Provide rapid, repeated, 13Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress Department of PsychiatryUniformed Services University4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799www.CSTSonline.organd developmentally and culturally appropriate communications about the nature of the disease, the reasons for quarantine, and other essential information. 2.Facilitate communication with loved ones . Knowledge of loved ones' conditions can have a powerful impacton the emotional health of quarantined individuals andimprove adherence to recommended quarantine. Forexample, knowing that loved ones are safe, healthy, andwell-cared for can reduce stress, while increased stressshould be anticipated when information is lackingor in cases of worrisome news. Before quarantine,allow sufficient time (within the limits of public healthconcerns) for patients to make arrangements, reassuretheir loved ones, and say goodbye. During quarantine,facilitate the use of technology (e.g., phone and videocalls, social media) to keep loved ones in contact witheach other. 3.Prepare for quarantine . Households and facilities under quarantine will need adequate food, householdsupplies, and medications to last for the duration ofthe quarantine. Once quarantine is imposed, there maybe limited ability to move about and shop as usual.Obtain necessary resources in advance of quarantineif possible, e.g., by making this part of a family's ororganization's disaster preparedness planning. 4.Reduce boredom and isolation. Planning foractivities during quarantine can help reduce boredomand lessen the focus on symptoms and feelings ofbeing isolated from family and friends. As above,facilitating access to the internet and social media isimportant to maintaining social networks and remotecommunication while in quarantine. However, mediaexposure should be monitored, as too much exposureand exposure to unreliable sources can increase stress.5.Take care of yourself. Healthcare providers are alsovulnerable to experiencing the psychological effectsof quarantine, and this can be compounded by thestress of caring for sick and distressed patients. Makesure your own basic needs are met, including: eating,drinking, and sleeping; taking breaks at predeterminedintervals; checking in with colleagues and loved ones;and ensuring that your family and organization are safeand have a plan in place for possible quarantine. If youare likely to work with infected individuals, have frankdiscussions with your family about the risk to you andto them and steps being taken to minimize that risk.Plan for the possibility that you may be quarantinedseparately from them if they are not exposed. 6.Keep quarantine as short as possible. When advisingpatients on length of time in quarantine, restrict thelength to what is scientifically reasonable and take carenot to adopt an overly cautious approach. In addition,do not extend quarantine length unless absolutelynecessary, and if this occurs, provide patients with up-to-date information as soon as possible.

Reactions may include combinations of confusion, fear, hopelessness, helplessness, sleeplessness, physical pain, anxiety, anger, grief, shock, aggressiveness, mistrustfulness, guilt, shame, shaken religious faith, and loss of confidence in self or others. A variety of helpful interventions can assist individuals and communities to recover. Following a disaster, governments and relief organizations play an important role in reducing distress for both victims and the broader society. Ensuring equitable distribution of resources (such as food, clothing and shelter) and prompt access to healthcare increase trust and improve outcomes. Adhering to ethical principles when providing interventions and relief efforts enhances community well-being. When interacting with individuals affected by a disaster event, there is consensus among international disaster experts and researchers that Psychological First Aid (PFA) can help alleviate painful emotions and reduce further harm from initial reactions to disasters. Y our actions and interactions with others can help provide PFA to people in distress, by creating and sustaining an environment of (1) safety, (2) calmness, (3) connectedness to others, (4) self-efficacy\u2014or empowerment, and (5) hopefulness. Considerthe following suggestions: DO: Help people meet basic needs for food & shelter, and obtain emergency medical attention. Provide repeated, simple and accurate information on how to obtain these(safet y). Listen to people who wish to share their stories andemotions; remember there is no wrong or right way tofeel (calming). Be friendly and compassionate even if people are being difficult (calmin g). Provide accurate information about the disaster or trauma and the relief efforts. This will help people understand the situation (calmin g). Help people contact friends or loved ones(connectednes s). Keep families together; keep children with parents orother close relatives whenever possible (connectedness). Give practical suggestions that encourage peopletowards helping themselves and meeting their ownneeds (self-efficacy). Direct people to locations of available government andnon-government services (hopefulness). If you know that more help and services are on the way, remind people of this when they express fear or worry(hopefulnes s). DON'T: Force people to share their stories with you, especiallyvery personal details (may decrease calming). Give simple reassurances like \"everything will be ok\" or\"at least you survived\" (often diminishes calmness). Tell people what you think they should be feeling, thinking or doing now or how they should have actedearlier (decreases self-efficacy). Tell people why you think they have suffered by givingreasons about their personal behaviors or beliefs (alsodecreases self-efficacy). Make promises that may not be kept (decreases hope). Criticize existing services or relief activities in front ofpeople in need of these services (diminishes hope andcalming). 15CSTS | Department of Psychiatry | Uniformed Services University | 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799 | www.CSTSonline.org Especially in the early stages of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, there is frequently a great deal of uncertainty about the nature of the disease, its spread, and its scope and impact. Caring for Patients' Mental Well-Being During Coronavirus and Other Emerging Infectious Diseases: A Guide for Clinicians As our world becomes increasingly interconnected, the potential for rapid and far-reaching spread of new infectious diseases is a growing threat. Especially in the early stages of an emerging infectious disease outbreak such as Coronavirus (COVID-19), there is frequently a great deal of uncertainty about the nature of the disease, its spread, and its scope and impact. This may lead to significant and understandable emotional distress, even among those who have not been, and don't know if they will be, directly exposed to the disease. During emerging infectious disease outbreaks, both medical and mental health clinicians are likely to encounter patients who are experiencing various levels of emotional distress about the outbreak and its impact on them, their families, and their communities. Providers should acknowledge uncertainty about emerging diseases and help patients understand that there is often an emotional component to potential health concerns. In addition, providers should consider the following recommendations for promoting patients' mental well-being during emerging infectious disease outbreaks: 1.Stay informed. Obtain the latest information about theoutbreak from credible public health resources, such asthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),in order to provide accurate information to yourpatients. 2.Educate. Healthcare providers are on the front lines of medical intervention and in a position to influencepatient behaviors for protecting individual, family, andpublic health. Patient education plays a critical role inboth containing the disease and mitigating emotionaldistress during outbreaks. Depending on the nature ofthe outbreak, this can range from education about basichygiene such as hand-washing and cough etiquetteto more complex medical recommendations forprevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Let patients knowwhat you, your office, or your organization is doing toreduce the risk of exposure. 3.Correct misinformation. In this age of social media,misinformation can spread quickly and easily, causingunnecessary alarm. If patients present you withinaccurate information related to the outbreak, correcttheir misconceptions and direct them to vetted publichealth resources.4.Limit media exposure. Today's 24-hour news cyclecan make it difficult to turn away from the TV , radio,or news feed, but research has shown that excess mediaexposure to coverage of stressful events can result innegative mental health outcomes. Use trusted mediaoutlets to gather the information you need, then turnthem off\u2014and advise your patients to do the same. 5.Anticipate and counsel about stress reactions.Emotional distress is common in the context ofuncertain and potentially life-threatening situations,such as outbreaks. a.A good first step for mitigating your patients'stress is to acknowledge that it exists and helpnormalize it (\"I see that you're stressed, and that'sunderstandable. Many people are feeling this wayright now. \") b.Teach patients to recognize the signs of distress,including worry, fear, insomnia, difficultyconcentrating, interpersonal problems, avoidingcertain situations at work or in daily living,unexplained physical symptoms, and increased useof alcohol or tobacco. This will help them becomemore aware of the state of their mental health 16Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress Department of PsychiatryUniformed Services University4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799www.CSTSonline.organd head off distress before it becomes harder to manage. c.Discuss strategies to reduce distress, which caninclude: i.Being prepared (e.g., developing a personal/ family preparedness plan for the outbreak). ii.Taking everyday preventive measures (e.g., frequent handwashing). iii.Maintaining a healthy diet and exercise regimen. iv.Talking to loved ones about worries and concerns. v.Engaging in hobbies and activities you enjoy to improve your mood. d.If a patient is experiencing severe emotionaldistress or has a diagnosable mental illness, refer forspecialized mental health care.6.Take care of yourself and your loved ones. Healthcareproviders are not invulnerable to experiencing theirown emotional distress during outbreaks, and thisdistress can be compounded by caring for sick anddistressed patients. Make sure your basic needs are met,including: eating, drinking, and sleeping; take a breakwhen you need one; check in with loved ones; practicethe strategies to reduce distress listed above; andmonitor yourself for stress reactions too. Make effortsto ensure that your office and/or organization has aviable plan to monitor the course of the outbreak andtake rapid and appropriate action if needed.

Leaders play critical roles in the recovery of communities and individuals after disasters. Leaders identify the way forward, and hear and understand the present emotions and needs of their community. They communicate and reflect the community's feelings and shared experience in order to lead the community in recovery. Understanding how people react to tragic events and the roles leaders play in recovery is critical to effective leadership. In the aftermath of traumatic events, many children and their parents, even those not living in close proximity to the event, want to hear guidance from their community's leaders. In this acute phase, leaders must attend to many responsibilities, including effective communication to people who have questions, seek reassurance, and want to take action. As shock and horror turn to sorrow and mourning, leaders are responsible for identifying the timing of when a community is ready for the next step forward and how best to speak the language of each community to help individuals, families and care providers. Understanding Traumatic Grief People vary in their reactions to experiencing or learning about traumatic losses. Most will do fine over time, while for some the immediate reactions can last longer than normal and interfere with their return to their work and families. In the short term, many people experience transient, but powerful, grief symptoms. Early grief can include: Waves of sadness Intrusive images of the traumatic event and lost lovedones Withdrawal from close relationships with family andfriendsAvoidance of activities that arereminders of the event For some people, grief can be delayed. For others grief may not ever be evident. Communicate Effectively with Y our Community Worry and distress can spread within and among communities, resulting in rumors and distortion of the facts of the event. Therefore, special attention should be given to optimizing communication with members of your community and with those outside of your community. Formal and informal leaders can be role models for the importance of sharing grief, communicating hope, identifying facts, managing rumors and providing support to others as needs change over time. Immediate Responses Be visible \u2014 Make public announcements and appearances By providing useful and accurate information, leaders can re-establish a sense of safety and enhance the community's trust in leadership. Provide Accurate, timely information on whatis known, what is not known, and when moreinformation will be communicated Press briefings, use of social media and community meetings can reassure families and dispel rumors. Always say when more information will be available. Understand that people process informationdifferently in high stress situations Keep messages as simple as possible, repeat frequently, and emphasize positive messages (people tend to focus on negative information when stressed). Use multiple channels of communication People Seek information from multiple sources depending on culture, ethnicity, geography, community composition and history. TV , newspapers, radio, ministers, teachers, firefighters and local places of gathering (e.g. post office, grocery, PTA) provide channels for communication. 18Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress Department of PsychiatryUniformed Services University4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799www.CSTSonline.orgSpeak calmly and encourage working together Leaders promote calmness, empathy, optimism, a can- do attitude and collective healing and recovery. Direct communication between parents and children is important. Return to school nearly always calms children but can be stressful for parents. Know the status of existing and available resources Monitor emerging needs, support fellow community leaders and structures (such as schools, health, public safety). Provide policy and guidance withoutmicromanagement Provide support to workers and volunteers with a framework for organizing and communicating policy. Recognize you cannot be \"at the front\" everywhere and others must make the tactical decisions. Foster initiative and cooperation. Organize memorial services and sites recognizing thediversity within the community Respect the desires and needs for families who have sustained losses. The timing of services is important. Attending funerals is important Tears and grieving in public by leaders gives permission to others to express grief and humanizes unthinkable tragedies. Recovery Focus on future goals Reorient the community to future objectives, enhanced preparedness, and \"we can do it. \" Acknowledge those from within and outside the community who want to and do help Establish a climate of healing and community support. Provide common goals for future direction Redirect energy into needed recovery projects and respectful remembering and rebuilding efforts. Avoid blaming Blame directed towards groups or individuals leads to stigma, anger, and desire for retribution. Redirect energy to providing support and future needs. Growing Work to return community activities to normal, but tolerate if recovery is slow. Recovery takes time, is not linear, and is influenced byfuture events that are always unknown. Set and celebrate achievable goals. Community rituals provide an opportunity forindividuals and families to heal and reflect on theirexperience in their own style. These can cross racial, cultural and socioeconomic divides. Beware of identifying a \"we and they\" . Be alert to the fault lines such as racial orsocioeconomic differences of the community. Thesetend to expand and become areas for conflict. Expect community disappointment and anger afterthe initial sense of togetherness. Help the communityunderstand the changing trajectory of recovery.

Strategies to Help Stay Calm Uncertainty and concern about catching an infectious disease, and protecting oneself and one's family, can increase feelings of stress. There are effective ways for individuals and families to manage stress and concern: Stay up-to-date about developments related to theinfectious disease outbreak by using a reliable andaccurate source of health-related information, such asthe CDC or the Red Cross. Stick to your usual daily routine. Focus on positive aspects of your life and things thatyou can control. Seek social support from family members and/orfriends and maintain social connections. Engage in relaxation techniques for stress reduction. Engage in physical activity and other enjoyableactivities. If you or a family member is feeling overwhelmed,seek support from your health care provider orreligious leader.Ways to Involve Y our Children in Family Health Care Including your children in your family's health care plan will lead to better understanding, counter fear of the unknown, and help children and adolescents feel a sense of control. Ask children what they have heard about infectiousdisease. Provide age appropriate, accurate information andclarify any misinformation or misunderstanding theymay have. Encourage children to share their concerns, and letthem know that parents and teachers are available todiscuss thoughts and feelings. Parents' behaviors have a significant effect on children.Keep conversations calm and focused on the facts.Emphasize efforts that are being taken to contain theinfectious disease. Model health-promoting behaviors for your children.For example, teach them to wash their hands with soapand water, reciting a nursery rhyme (e.g., HumptyDumpty) that helps them understand how long theyshould wash. Educate the entire family about good health habits. Talkabout what each family member can do to help othersoutside of the immediate family.

STRENGTHENING STRESS MANAGEMENTSKILLS BEFORE AND DURING ADISASTER RESPONSE The ideal time to strengthen stress managementskills, both for you and your employees, isbefore a disaster occurs. These skills are alsoimportant for employees who stay behind whentheir coworkers are engaged in offsite disasterresponse work. You can offer the followingself-care tips to your employees, and practicethem yourself, to prevent and manage stress inyour workplace both before and during disasterresponse and recovery efforts: \u0083Maintain a healthy diet, and get routine exercise and adequate rest. \u0083Spend time with family and friends. \u0083Pay attention to health concerns, andschedule routine checkups to ensure you areready when called for an assignment. \u0083Keep up with personal tasks (e.g., pay bills,mow the lawn, shop for groceries). This canhelp you avoid having to complete last-minutetasks that can take away from time spentpreparing for your response assignment. \u0083Think about your goals for upcomingassignments, and how you can applylessons learned from past assignments tofuture situations. \u0083Reflect upon what your disaster responseexperiences have meant personallyand professionally. \u0083Get involved in personal and family disasterpreparedness activities. 1 222 Toll-Free: 1-877-SAMHSA-7 (1-877-726-4727) | Info@samhsa.hhs.gov https://store.samhsa.gov| TIPS FOR SUPERVISORS OF DISASTER RESPONDERS: HELPING STAFF MANAGE STRESS WHEN RETURNING TO WORK PREPARING YOUR ORGANIZATION FOR RETURNING EMPLOYEES Supporting your returning employees starts withorganizational policies and priorities. You canwork with other leaders of your organization to: \u0083Create an atmosphere where people can be open with supervisors about theirexperiences, feelings, and concerns. \u0083Create structured forums for respondersto present their lessons learned orrecommendations for organization-widepreparedness activities. \u0083Optimize liberal or flexible leave policies forreturning employees. \u0083Be candid about the complex and potentiallydifficult job that supervisors and managersface\u2014meeting both individual needs and theneed to maintain ongoing work. HELPING YOUR RETURNING EMPLOYEES TRANSITION TO ROUTINE WORK Upon returning to their duties, some employeesmay face difficulties readjusting. Many of thesechallenges typically subside over time as staffreturn to previous routines. If these difficulties donot subside, refer to the When To Suggest That Your Staff Seek Help section of this tip sheet. A few potential difficulties are described below,along with some tips on how you can help. Unrelenting fatigue. Sometimes excessive stress results in never feeling rested. Some employeesmay experience extreme fatigue, even whenthey are getting a sufficient amount of sleepeach night. Encourage your employees to get amedical evaluation if the problem persists. Pace change. Disaster responders grow accustomed to the rapid pace of the disasterenvironment, and for some employees, returningto a more typical rhythm of work may bechallenging. It may appear as though peopleare moving at a much slower pace than theyremember. Encourage returning responders torefrain from judging colleagues or criticizing thedifference in the pace of work in your organizationcompared to their disaster work. Cynicism. During disaster work, responders often see the worst in individuals and systems,and it is easy to become cynical. These feelingsare expected, and they typically diminish overtime. Try to help your team members regainperspective by reviewing the successes andpositive results from their assignment. Dissatisfaction with routine work. Saving lives and protecting our fellow citizens' health andsafety can be rewarding and energizing, but most work does not provide such dramatic and immediate reinforcement. As a result, some returning team members may perceive their daily work routine as lacking in meaning and satisfaction. Ask about the positive things your employees learned and experienced during the disaster response, and find ways to incorporate these things into their work. For example, you may consider giving them a role in your company's emergency response planning. Easily evoked emotions. Sometimes the combination of intense experiences, fatigue, and stress leaves disaster responders especially vulnerable to unexpected emotions. For example, they may cry easily, be quick to anger, or experience dramatic mood swings. These are fairly common reactions that typically subside over time. You can help responders cope with their emotions in the following ways: \u0083Provide support and education to all yourstaff members, and allow them to discusstheir experiences with you in order todetermine the best way to decrease thesereactions in the workplace. \u0083Encourage returning employees to be awareof and monitor their reactions. 233 Toll-Free: 1-877-SAMHSA-7 (1-877-726-4727) | Info@samhsa.hhs.gov https://store.samhsa.gov| TIPS FOR SUPERVISORS OF DISASTER RESPONDERS: HELPING STAFF MANAGE STRESS WHEN RETURNING TO WORK \u0083If strong emotions become disruptive in the workplace, consider the following strategies: -Discuss the options of additional leave. -Help disaster responders locate astress management or responder stresstraining course. -Encourage them to seek professionalhelp. Some disaster responders areconcerned about being stigmatized whenseeking mental health or substancemisuse support services, so it is importantfor you to create a \"safe place\" withoutjudgment for employees to discussaccessing support services if needed.Check out the Helpful Resources section of this tip sheet for more information onfinding support services. Sharing experiences. Though returning employees may want to share their experiences with others, some may feel uncomfortable doing so. You can help ease team members' worries by taking the following actions: \u0083Consider facilitating group meetings thatprovide a structured opportunity for youremployees to share experiences, especiallycoping skills, with others who have hadsimilar experiences. Encourage returningemployees to reflect on their experience interms of the following: -How did they function in the environment? -What unrecognized skills or talents didthey discover? \u0083Caution staff to take care when discussingdisturbing scenes. Others may be upset bygraphic descriptions of the disaster environment. Difficulties with colleagues and supervisors. Returning employees may not experience a\"welcome back\" from their colleagues that meets their expectations. Some coworkers may resent the additional workload they had to carry as a result of employees' absence, or they may resent the recognition that the disaster responders receive upon their return. Consider taking steps to avert these difficulties: \u0083Be sure to show proper appreciation forthe impact that everyone feels when oneor more employees are on assignment andothers are not. \u0083Remind staff that everyone is a part of theresponse effort, not only those directlydeployed but also those who remain in theirregular posts providing coverage for those inthe field. \u0083Be aware that, if the returning staffwere exposed to potentially contagiousillnesses while on the disaster assignment(or coworkers believe this to be the case), returning staff may be isolated orstigmatized. Accurate information, deliveredto the entire team by an unbiased source(such as a local medical expert), can helpease this type of situation.

If this was lacking for the current disaster response, after action review should include a plan to address for the future. Organizational policies and priorities to support redeployment Create an atmosphere where responders can be open with supervisors about their experiences, feelings, and c oncerns. Create structured forums for responders to present lessons learned/recommendations for future preparedness activities. Give specific advice regarding co mmonly faced readjustment issues such as sleep, coping with emotions related to disaster response, ways to find support and support others, and managing conflicts. Optimiz e liberal or flexible leave policies for returning employees. What to expect from the workforce Returnees may experience: Extreme fatigue - encourage extra rest for all responders; medically evaluate if fatigue is persistent. Adjustment period - as they return to the normal pace versus crisis response pace, normalize and va lidate. Reflect on the different demand characteristics of the situation. Cynicism -d isappointment, l o ss and blame are common responses and there are always examples of people and organizations at their worst. Help workers regain perspective by focusing on successes and positive outcomes. Ask about lessons learned and experience s endured. Incorporate lessons learned in collaborative, transparent way, when planning for the future. Emotional sensitivity, intense emotions - expect it, provide support and norma lize this reactio n as typical and temporary. Help workers cope and contain. Offer extra leave if necessary, and/or stress management learning opportunities. Create safety for those who need additional support, including professional help. Characterize appropriate help seeking as a positive community value. Provide opportunities for sharing experiences - those with similar roles often feel validated discussing shared experiences. Sharing across roles is important as well and can engender empathy, understanding, and cohesion. Nevertheless, sharing across roles must be strategic and it is vital to ensure that both types of disclosure are given adequate support and space. Be mindful of graphic discussion, which m ay cause distress for some. Difficulties with colleagues and supervisors - b e aware of the \"we\" versus \"t hey\" between those who responded and those who stayed behind. A ppreciate the impact of the crisis on everyone. Identify and discuss important roles played b y both sides. Remind staff that everyone is a part of the response effort. If present, address/quell misinformation directed at returnees regarding fears of contagion by providing info rmati on from an unbiased, truste d sour ce.Redeploying Healthcare Workers 26For Leadership Be prepared with resources and referrals for those who may require additional help. Have a plan for managing counterproductive responses (e.g., degrading help seeking, or criticizing/judging another's role in the crisis response). Be su re to apply self-care recommendations to yourself, especially if you are starting to identify with returning staff members' descriptions of stress symptoms, such as sleep problems, stomach ailments, or irritability. 27About NCDMPH MISSION: The mission of the National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health is to improve our Nation's disaster health readiness through education and science.
