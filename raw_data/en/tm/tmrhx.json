The University of Pittsburgh Office of Technology Management (OTM) and its affiliate office, the Office of Enterprise Development Health Science s (OED) is a service of the Office of the Senior Vice chancellor and acts as resources for health science faculty pursuing entrepreneurship and interactions with industry. ( http://www.oed.pitt.edu ) OED is a central link bringing the University of Pittsburgh's world class researchers together with the life sciences business community. The OTM serves as the hub of all technology commercialization activities at the university. The OTM assists in fulfilling the Univer sity's mission of education, research and public service by facilitating the development of products and processes from University technology for the benefit of the University, its faculty and staff, and the community. OTM provides an Inventors Handbook t o researchers to help them become well informed, effective participants in the process of transferring University inventions to the commercial sector. The OTM has a comprehensive web site http://www.otm.pitt.edu designed to assist investigators in all aspects of technology management, including licensing. To manage the commercialization activities for staff, the OTM employs intellectual property experts, specialized licensing managers, business development and techn ology marketing professionals, education and outreach teams and reporting and compliance personnel. The OTM and OED continue to focus on engaging more faculty, staff and students in the innovation commercialization process; educating them about such endea vors; and building a community of \"Pitt Innovators,\" who are defined as those who enter the process officially by submitting invention disclosures for commercial consideration. _______________________________________________________ ______________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2010 -2011 Annual C.U.R.E.

Report Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh - Research Development Report - 3 A specific function of the Office of Technology Management is education and training opportunities to faculty, s taff, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students related to commercialization of research. Additionally, the Office of Enterprise Development offers customized seminars to department s and centers on issues related to commercialization, such as Intellect ual Property , Corporate Collaborations , Funding for Commercial Development and Starting a Company . During this reporting period, the Office of Technology Management (OTM) and Office of Enterprise Development, Health Sciences (OED) engaged in a series of activities to provide training opportunities to faculty, staff, pos tdoctoral fellows, and students related to the commercialization of research. Activities included the following : In fall 2010, OTM and the Office of the Provost once again hosted a seven -week course, \"Academic Entrepreneurship: The Business of Innovation Commercialization\" for faculty and their research students. The course focuses on the early stages of commercial innovation development and teaches participants how to transform their ideas and research into commercially viable business opportunities The OED, in February 2011, hosted its own 10 -week commercialization course, called \"From Benchtop to Bedside: What Every Scientist Needs to Know.\" The course focuses on the innovation developme nt/commercialization process, but with particular emphasis on life sciences -related technologies, regulatory issues, and topics such as business models based on insurance reimbursement. OTM/OED conducted six introductory presentations in departments across campus, as well as to student classes. The OTM distributed its \"Pitt Innovator's Guide to... Technology Commercialization at the University of Pittsburgh\" throughout the year. OTM/OED have been working closely with the Swanson School of Engineering for t he past year in the development of a new Medical Innovation Center that would bring students and faculty together as teams to develop and commercialize new innovations. OTM/OED has been working to educate the development team and prepare for educating stud ents who will join the innovation development teams. In October 2010, OTM hosted its sixth annual Celebration of Innovation before an audience of more than 150 innovators, as well as both University and external supporters. OED hosted several lecture pro grams in FY 2011, including a well -attended program that featured Robert Langer, a famous technology -based innovator and entrepreneur from MIT who talked about how to turn unique innovations into successful companies. An estimated 300 people - mostly facul ty and students -- attended the lecture.
