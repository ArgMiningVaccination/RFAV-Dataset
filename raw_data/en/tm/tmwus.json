Lack of adequate data supporting effectiveness implicates compounded products as well. This policy provides coverage information about the use of injectable (both intramuscular and subcutaneous) 17-alpha- hydroxyprogesterone caproate, commonly be referred to as 17P. Intramuscular and subcutaneous injection of 17P, including but not limited to compounded 17P, is not proven nor medically necessary for prevention of spontaneous preterm birth due to the approval for the drug being withdrawn by the FDA. Note: Oral and intravaginal formulations of progesterone are not addressed in this policy and should be obtained through the member's pharmacy benefit.

Deliveries that are early by five weeks or more are the leading cause o f infant morbidity and mortality in the United Stat es. Asymptomatic women can be considered to be at high risk of spontaneous preterm delivery due to various risk factors, incl uding previous preterm delivery, preterm labor, multiple pregnancy, or sho rt cervix. Progesterone is known to have an inhibit ory effect on uterine contractility and is thought to play a key role in the maintenance of pregnancy until term. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Makena is hydroxyprogesterone caproate, a synthe tic progestin. Benefit Considerations The UnitedHealthcare standard Certificate of Coverag e excludes coverage for non-injectable medications administered in a physician's office. Oral and intravaginal progester one formulations are administered as a pharmacy ben efit. Some Certificates of Coverage allow for coverage of e xperimental/investigational/unproven treatments for life-threatening illnesses when certain conditions are met. The memb er specific benefit plan document must be consulted to make coverage decisions for this service. Some states mandate ben efit coverage for off-label use of medications for some diagnoses or under some circumstances when certain conditions are met. Where such mandates apply, they supersede language in the benefit document or in the medical or drug policy. Benefit coverage for an otherwise unproven service for the treatment of serious rare diseases may occur when certain conditions are met. Refer to the Policy and Procedure addressing the t reatment of serious rare diseases. Clinical Evidence Unproven Singleton Pregnancy Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Based on the available evidence, Makena is no longe r shown to be effective for its approved use\u2014either for its indicated population or any subset of that population.13 The randomized, placebo-controlled trials specific ally designed to evaluate Makena's approved use in the intended population\u2014Tr ials 002 and 003\u2014provide the most rigorous and rele vant evidence to evaluate Makena's efficacy for its approved use. Ma kena's accelerated approval was based on one adequa te and well- controlled trial (Trial 002). The treatment effect shown in Trial 002 on the intermediate clinical end point of delivery < 37 weeks gestation appeared independent of race, number of p rior preterm deliveries, and gestational age of the prior preterm birth (PTB). Trial 003, which was almost four times large r than Trial 002, failed to show that Makena reduce d the proportion of women delivering prior to 37-, 35-, or 32-weeks' ge station. Furthermore, exploratory subgroup analyses of Trial 003 did not provide evidence of a treatment effect in any ident ified subgroup analyzed, including those with risk factors that differed between Trials 002 and 003. There was no consistent evidence of treatment effect within an identified subpopulation across Trials 002 and 003 [e.g., by race, number of prior spontaneous preterb birth (sPTB)]. The FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has generally interpreted the substa ntial evidence of effectiveness standard as requiri ng clinically and statistically significant findings from at least tw o adequate and well-controlled trials. A single pos itive trial, even if well- conducted, may have biases or may reflect a chance finding. If the collective findings of Trials 002 a nd 003 were submitted at the same time in an NDA seeking approval, CDER would conclude that there is not substantial evidence of effectiveness of Makena for reducing the risk of recurrent PTB\u2014for e ither the overall population of women with a single ton pregnancy and a 17 -Alpha -Hydroxyprog esterone Caproate (Makena \u00ae and 17P) Page UnitedHealthcare Commercial Medical Benefit Drug Po licy Effective 08/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyri ght 2023 United HealthCare Services, Inc. history of singleton sPTB, or for any identified su bset of that population. Lastly, review of publishe d evidence potentially relevant to the efficacy of Makena did not demonstr ate Makena was effective in reducing the risk of PT B. CDER thoroughly explored all available evidence of effectiveness. CD ER's analysis included other available data, in add ition to Trials 002 and 003, on the effect of HPC (the active ingredient in Makena) on singleton sPTB. These data included CDER' s review of (a) the EPPPIC metaanalysis,12 (b) five observational studies with HPC in Makena's indicated population, (c) three randomized, placebo-controlled trials described by the manufact urer Covis as supporting safety of HPC in other group s at high risk for PTB, and (d) three additional studies Covis points to as supporting the Trial 002 results. After review, CDER concluded these studies do not support a finding that Makena is effective i n reducing PTB, as enumerated below. EPPPIC (Evaluating Progestogens for Preventing Prete rm birth International Collaborative) is an individu al participant data meta-analysis of RCTs that evaluated the effect of v arious progestogens (vaginal progesterone, oral pro gesterone, and injectable HPC) compared to control (placebo or no-i ntervention) or to each other administered during p regnancy in preventing PTB (first occurrence or recurrent PTB). EPPPIC incl uded a total of 31 11,644 women with singleton or multifetal gestations, with or without a history of prior PTB, and with or without a short mid-trimest er cervical length.12 Among EPPPIC's 31 clinical trials, CDER focused on the fiv e trials (two of which were Trials 002 and 003) in the EPPPIC meta-analysis that have some relevance to Makena, because these t rials evaluated HPC in singleton pregnancies and wer e placebo- controlled. Other than Trials 002 and 003, two of t he five trials included non-Makena indicated patien ts, such as pregnant women with a shortened cervix in the current pregna ncy but no prior birth, or dosing different than th at of Makena (HPC 500 mg rather than the HPC 250 mg in Makena). The remain ing trial had known drug quality issues potentially impacting drug potency and efficacy. In addition, CDER's review ide ntified important issues in data analysis and resul ts interpretation of the EPPPIC study. Specifically, the investigator's concl usion of beneficial effect in reducing PTB < 34 wee ks was based on an effect estimate that was not statistically significant (HR = 0.83, 95% C I = 0.68-1.01). Second, the claim of treatment effect among \"high-risk\" women (those with short cervix) is not evident because the analyses were based on a small subset (n = 81, 2.7%) of total study populations in five trials, with 70% of them treated with an HPC dose regimen twice that of the approved Makena dose, and without suitable statistical adjustment f or multiplicity after assessing multiple subgroup a nalyses. Even given these caveats, the meta-analysis of these five HPC trials did not show a statistically significant finding on the main outcomes of delivery prior to 37-, 34-, or 28-weeks' gestation, perinatal deaths, or serious neonatal complication s. CDER also identified five observational studies that provided exploratory evi dence about HPC's effect for its approved use using keyword searches132 of the PubMed database. Although noting that observ ational studies have limitations in drawing causal inferences, CDER resolved that the lack of evidence of effectiveness across these 5 studies provides further support fo r the conclusion that Makena is not effective in the indicated population . Multiple Gestations Intramuscular Administration Schuit et al. (2015) conducted an individual ipant data meta-analysis (IPDMA) to assess the effe ctiveness of progestogen treatment in the prevention of neonatal morbidity o r preterm birth (PTB) in 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17Pc) or vagina lly administered natural progesterone, compared wit h placebo or no treatment were included in the analysis. The primar y outcome was a composite of perinatal mortality an d severe neonatal morbidity. Thirteen trials included 3,768 women and their 7,536 babies. Researchers found neither 17Pc nor vaginal progesterone reduced the incidence of adverse perin atal outcome (17Pc relative 95% CI 0.77- 1.2). Therefore, in unselected women with an uncomp licated twin gestation, treatment with progestogens (intramuscul ar 17Pc or vaginal natural progesterone) does not i mprove perinatal outcome. Awwad et al. (2015) conducted a randomized, control led, double-blind trial to assess whether alpha-hyd roxyprogesterone caproate (17OHPC) prolongs gestation beyond 37 week s (primary outcome) and reduces neonatal morbidity (secondary outcome) in twin pregnancy (PROGESTWIN).3 Pregnant women received weekly injections of 250 m g 17OHPC (n = 194) or placebo (n = 94), from 16-20 to 36 weeks of gestati on. Intramuscular 17OHPC therapy did not reduce PTB before 37 weeks of gestation in unselected twin pregnancies. However, 17OHPC treatment reduced neonatal morbidity paramete rs and increased birthweight. Short Cervix Winer et al. (2015) conducted an open-label, multic enter, randomized controlled trial in 105 women wit h asymptomatic singleton pregnancies from 20(+ 0) through 31(+ 6) weeks of gestation with a cervical length less than 25 mm and a history of 17 -Alpha -Hydroxyprog esterone Caproate (Makena \u00ae and 17P) Page UnitedHealthcare Commercial Medical Benefit Drug Po licy Effective 08/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

The primary outcome was time from randomizat ion to delivery. After an interim analysis demonstr ated the lack of efficacy of 17OHP-C in prolonging pregnancy, the stu dy was discontinued because of futility. 17OHP-C did not prolong pregnancy in women with singleton gestations, a son ographic short cervix, and other risk factors of pr eterm delivery (prior history, uterine malformations, cervical surgery, o r prenatal DES exposure). Professional Societies American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists In April 2023, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published a Practice Advis ory to serve as an update to Practice Bulletin No. 234, Prediction and Prevention of Spontaneous Preterm Birth, originall y published in 2021.14 This Practice Advisory was provided to address the April 6, 2023, decision by the FDA to withdraw appr oval of Makena and its generics (17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate [17 -OHPC]). Additionally, the Practice Advisory served to update the current evidence and recommendations for the use of progest erone for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth . The ACOG guidance regarding the use of progesterone for the preventio n of preterm birth is included in ACOG Practice Bull etin No. 234, \"Prediction and Prevention of Spontaneous Preterm Birth\". Updat ed recommendations are: Vaginal progesterone may be considered as a treatme nt option for patients with a history of preterm bi rth, singleton gestation, and a shortened cervix. However, vaginal progesterone has not been proven effective in the absence of a shortened cervix and should not be considered as an alternative to 17-OHPC. Intramuscular 17-OHPC is not recommended for the pri mary prevention of preterm birth in patients with a history of spontaneous preterm birth. Dependent upon cervical length measurement, prior p regnancy history, and past treatment, a discussion of the range of interventions available to prevent a recurrent pret erm birth should occur and a collaborative action p lan should be developed. In 2016, ACOG published a practice bulletin (No. 16 9) regarding Multifetal Gestations that included th e following statement on progesterone therapy:7 Progesterone treatment does not reduce the incidenc e of spontaneous preterm birth in unselected women with twin or triplet gestations and, therefore, is not recommend ed. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) This section is to be used for informational purpos es only. FDA approval alone is not a basis for cove rage. Makena was approved under an accelerated approval p athway in 2011.13 As a condition of this approval, the sponsor was required to conduct a confirmatory clinical trial t o demonstrate the predicted clinical benefit to new borns. On April 6, 2023, the FDA announced the final decision to withdraw approv al of Makena.13,15,16 Makena and its generics are not shown to be effect ive for reducing the risk of preterm birth in women wit h singleton pregnancy who have a history of singlet on spontaneous preterm birth. Additionally, Makena and its generics have n ot been shown to be effective for any subgroup of t his population, including in women at high risk of preterm birth. The benefit s of Makena do not outweigh the risks. References 1. United States Pharmacopeia: 2008-2009 USP Pharmacis ts' Compounding-Sterile Preparations.
