A B S T R A C T Background Immunization rates for children and adults are rising, but coverage levels have not reached optimal goals. As a result, vaccine-preventable diseases still occur. In an era of increasing complexity of immunization schedules, rising expectations about the performance of primary care, and large demands on primary care providers, it is important to understand and promote interventions that work in primary care settings to increase immunization coverage. One common theme across immunization programs in many nations involves the challenge of implementing a population-based approach and identifying all eligible recipients, for example the children who should receive the measles vaccine. However, this issue is gradually being addressed through the availability of immunization registries and electronic health records. A second common theme is identifying the best strategies to promote high vaccination rates. Three types of strategies have been studied: (1) patient-oriented interventions, such as patient reminder or recall, (2) provider interventions, and (3) system interventions, such as school laws. One of the most prominent intervention strategies, and perhaps best studied, involves patient reminder or recall systems. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate and compare the eectiveness of various types of patient reminder and recall interventions to improve receipt of immunizations. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to January 2017. We also searched grey literature and trial registers to January 2017. Selection criteria We included randomized trials, controlled before and a/f_ter studies, and interrupted time series evaluating immunization-focused patient reminder or recall interventions in children, adolescents, and adults who receive immunizations in any setting. We included no-intervention control groups, standard practice activities that did not include immunization patient reminder or recall, media-based activities aimed at promoting immunizations, or simple practice-based awareness campaigns. We included receipt of any immunizations as eligible outcome measures, excluding special travel immunizations. We excluded patients who were hospitalized for the duration of the study period.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Cochrane Eective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. We present results for individual studies as relative rates using risk ratios, and risk dierences for randomized trials, and as absolute changes in percentage points for controlled before-a/f_ter studies. We present pooled results for randomized trials using the random-eects model. Main results The 75 included studies involved child, adolescent, and adult participants in outpatient, community-based, primary care, and other settings in 10 countries. Patient reminder or recall interventions, including telephone and autodialer calls, letters, postcards, text messages, combination of mail or telephone, or a combination of patient reminder or recall with outreach, probably improve the proportion of participants who receive immunization (risk ratio (RR) of 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 1.35; risk dierence of 8%) based on moderate certainty evidence from 55 studies with 138,625 participants. Three types of single-method reminders improve receipt of immunizations based on high certainty evidence: the use of postcards (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.30; eight studies; 27,734 participants), text messages (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.44; six studies; 7772 participants), and autodialer (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32; five studies; 11,947 participants). Two types of single-method reminders probably improve receipt of immunizations based on moderate certainty evidence: the use of telephone calls (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.54; seven studies; 9120 participants) and letters to patients (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.38; 27 studies; 81,100 participants). Based on high certainty evidence, reminders improve receipt of immunizations for childhood (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.29; risk dierence of 8%; 23 studies; 31,099 participants) and adolescent vaccinations (RR 1.29, 95% CI to 1.42; risk dierence of 7%; 10 studies; 30,868 participants). Reminders probably improve receipt of vaccinations for childhood influenza (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.99; risk dierence of 22%; five studies; 9265 participants) and adult influenza (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.43; risk dierence of 9%; 15 studies; 59,328 participants) based on moderate certainty evidence. They may improve receipt of vaccinations for adult pneumococcus, tetanus, hepatitis B, and other non-influenza vaccinations based on low certainty evidence although the confidence interval includes no eect of these interventions (RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.78; four studies; 8065 participants). Authors' conclusions Patient reminder and recall systems, in primary care settings, are likely to be eective at improving the proportion of the target population who receive immunizations. P L A I N /uni00A0 L A N G U A G E /uni00A0 S U M M A R Y Do strategies to remind people to have vaccinations increase the number of people who receive vaccinations? Aim of this review The aim of this review is to determine whether strategies to remind people to receive vaccinations increase the number of people who receive vaccinations. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Key messages Reminding people to receive their vaccinations increases vaccination rates across dierent populations. What was studied Vaccinations are used to prevent a number of diseases but there is wide variation in vaccination coverage across dierent regions and countries. This can lead to diseases that are otherwise preventable by vaccines, having a large eect on individuals and communities. Informing people of an upcoming vaccination or telling them that they have missed a vaccination might help to increase coverage and reduce the eect and impact of disease preventable by vaccine. We reviewed 75 studies to evaluate whether reminding people to get vaccinated worked. The studies we looked at were from dierent settings, such as rural areas, schools, private practices, and state health departments. Most studies were done in the USA. The studies included a range of dierent groups: infants and children, adolescents and adults requiring routine vaccination, as well as adults who required the influenza vaccine. In most of the studies reminders took the form of person to person telephone calls, automated calls, letters or postcards. In few recent studies text messaging was used. Main results of the review Our review found that reminding people to have vaccinations likely increases the number of people who receive vaccinations by an average of 8 percentage points, although there was variation in the results of the studies. Reminding people by telephone and autodialer calls, sending a letter or postcard, or sending a text message increased vaccinations. Combinations of reminders were also eective.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Global coverage of routine immunizations varies widely (Hill 2016 ; European CDPC 2014; WHO 2016a ). The global rate for three doses of diphtheria tetanus pertussis (DTP3) vaccine was estimated to be 86% in 2014, an increase of 66 percentage points since the 1980 level of 20% (WHO 2016a ). However, approximately 18.7 million children did not receive DTP3 during 2014 (WHO 2016b ). Rates vary by geographic area or country, with high levels of DTP3, ranging from 91% to 94% in the Americas, Europe, and the Western Pacific in 2014 ( WHO 2016b ). In 2014, the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and African regions had lower coverage rates of 73% to 84% ( WHO 2016b ). In the United States, immunization rates remain high and stable for infants and children, but coverage levels have not reached national goals for a number of vaccines, including the newer vaccinations introduced (Hill 2016 ; Seither 2016 ). Immunization rates remain nowhere near national coverage goals for influenza, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, and adult vaccinations against herpes pneumococcal disease (Lu 2013; Reagan-Steiner 2016; Stokley 2014). Vaccination rates also vary by state, race, and ethnicity (CDC 2016a ; Hill 2015 ; Reagan-Steiner 2015; Seither 2015 ; Williams 2015 ). For example, influenza immunization rates during the 2013 to 2014 influenza season varied by race or ethnicity, with reports of 46.7% among whites 19 years and older, compared with 36.5% among blacks, and 33.2% among Hispanics or Latinos (Williams 2016 ). Burden of vaccine-preventable diseases As a result of unmet immunization goals, vaccine-preventable diseases still have a significant eect in a number of countries (Clemmons 2015 ; European CDPC 2014; Williams 2016 ). This is evidenced by the continued occurrence of measles outbreaks, for example in Disneyland in California during 2015 (Clemmons 2015 ). In the European Union and three European Economic Area countries, 11,316 cases of measles were reported during 2012 ( European CDPC 2014). The burden of vaccine-preventable illnesses has also included approximately 226,000 influenza- related hospitalizations, 3000 to 49,000 influenza-related deaths, and 13,500 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease that occur each year in the US (Williams 2016 ). In Europe, an estimated four to 50 million symptomatic cases of influenza occur each year, and 15,000 to 70,000 deaths have been attributed to influenza annually ( European CDPC 2016). Further, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in the US and in some other nations are far lower than optimal, leading to many new cases of HPV infection and ultimately HPV-related cancers (Viens 2016 ). Each year, 6.2 million persons are newly infected with HPV, and 26,000 new HPV-related cancers are diagnosed in the US (Jemal 2013 ; Weinstock 2004). Cancers attributable to HPV infections lead to more than USD 4 billion in annual medical expenses in the US (Markowitz 2014). Description of the intervention Patient reminders notify populations, patients, or their parents or legal guardians of vaccines that are due because of age or other risk factors (AHRQ 2015 ; Jacobson 2016; Jacobson Vann 2005). The notification is delivered to populations or patients. Patient recalls refer to notifications of vaccines that are past due. For example, a letter sent to a patient at 60 years of age, informing her that she is now due for the shingles vaccine, is a patient reminder (Hales2014 ; Jacobson Vann 2005). The patient who receives a notice at age 61 years about the shingles vaccine is getting a recall because the patient is past due, but would still benefit from receiving a shingles vaccination. Reminders and recalls require the source of the notification, whether a care provider, health services organization, public health authority, or community organization, to have access to the patient's contact information to facilitate the notification. The notification may be delivered by letter, postcard, telephone call, computerized telephone call, or text message (AHRQ 2015 ). The process would require the source of the notification to have determined the individual patient's status, in terms of being recommended for the vaccine by nature of the patient's age or risk condition or both, and not being vaccinated at the time of the notification. How the intervention might work Patient reminder or recall interventions work by addressing the common reasons that immunizations may be missed, such as forgetting or missing appointments, not knowing immunization schedules ( Ahmed 2013 ; AHRQ 2015 ), and having concerns about vaccinations. The success of the patient or reminder recall intervention depends upon several factors, such as accuracy or currency of contact information, accuracy and completeness of vaccination records, viability of contact medium, readability or comprehensibility of the contact medium or message by the patient or patient's parent or legal guardian or caretaker, beliefs and attitudes about vaccinations, and access to health services or vaccinations (Esposito 2014; Pereira 2012; Thomas 2014 ). Why it is important to do this review In an era of increasing complexity of immunization schedules (CDC 1999a ), rising expectations about the performance of primary care, and large demands on primary care physicians, it is important to understand and promote interventions that work in primary care settings. One strategy involves patient reminder or recall systems, which was recommended by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (CPS Task Force 2016) and the Standards for Immunization Practices (National Vaccine Advisory Committee 2014 ). Despite the successes made in vaccinating populations under-vaccination still occurs, resulting in vaccine-preventable deaths and illnesses (Clemmons 2015 ; European CDPC 2014; Williams 2016 ). Experts recommend that care providers utilize reminder or recall systems (CPS Task Force 2016; National Vaccine Advisory Committee 2014); however, there is evidence to suggest that few primary care providers actually use immunization reminder or recall systems, or both (Kempe 2012c; Pereira 2012; Tierney 2003). In a national survey of pediatric practices, only 16% of responding practices utilized them (Tierney 2003). A range of dierent types of reminders and systems of recall are being implemented. Ten countries, including a number in Europe, have adopted computerized immunization information services or registries (Groom 2014). Immunization registries oer the potential to become the backbone of patient reminder or recall systems by identifying the populations at risk, providing algorithms to determine who is eligible based on vaccination recommendations, and providing systems to send postcards, letters, autodialer messages, and text message reminders (Kempe 2012c).

M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies We included randomized trials, controlled before and a/f_ter studies, and interrupted time series studies. We included good quality, controlled, non-randomized studies to provide a suiciently large number of studies to assess each intervention sub-type. We excluded observational studies in which participants self-selected to intervention groups. We reviewed the methods of each study to determine the study design, not relying on the authors' specified designs. We accepted a study that randomly selected intervention participants and selected matched controls in a non-random fashion as a controlled before-a/f_ter design if pre-intervention and post-intervention immunization data were collected. Due to limited resources, we excluded non-English language publications. Types of participants We included as participants children, from birth to 18 years, or adults who receive immunizations in any setting, including academic or non-academic, and developed or developing countries. We excluded studies of patients who were hospitalized for the study duration. Types of interventions We included patient reminder or recall interventions, or both, that either reminded patients of upcoming immunizations or immunization visits that were due (reminders) or overdue (recall). Reminder and recall systems could be delivered by telephone, letter, postcard, text message, automatic electronic telephone calls (autodialer), within a secure online patient portal system, or in person, for example, a care provider giving a face-to-face reminder during a home visit, but not a clinic visit. Reminder and recall cues could also vary in specificity, number, and whether combined with other interventions, such as provider reminders or outreach. Specificity may vary from generic immunization reminders to personal reminders that address patient-specific immunization needs. Frequency may be one-time or multiple reminders. We included studies with multiple interventions if at least one study arm included immunization patient reminders or recall. We added text messages and messages occurring within patient portal systems in the current update.Control activities We included no-intervention control groups, standard practice activities that did not include immunization-focused patient reminder or recall interventions, media-based activities aimed at promoting immunizations, and simple practice-based immunization awareness campaigns. Types of outcome measures Our primary outcome measure was receipt of immunizations. We selected this outcome measure over other possible outcomes because of certain limitations, for example: the total number of vaccines would vary based on country, age group, and other factors; the proportion of the population that received all vaccines would depend on the specific population, such as age group; and on-time vaccination is restrictive and is not expected to support clinicians' eorts to optimize receipt of vaccinations. We accepted outcomes for individual vaccinations or standard combinations of recommended vaccinations, such as all recommended vaccinations by a specific date or age. If outcomes for a study were measured at multiple time points, we selected the outcomes designated as primary by the study authors. If unclear, we averaged outcomes over time periods. We excluded immunizations that were sought for purposes of traveling to a destination where the disease may be widespread, and immunization orders or visits that did not also measure immunization status. Search methods for identification of studies We conducted searches of electronic databases, references lists of articles and reviews, grey literature, clinical trials websites, and identified articles from our team members, those already in use by our team for other clinical, teaching or project work, and experts in the field. Electronic searches For this update, we conducted a series of searches between February 2013 and 31 January 2017. We revised all our search strategies in January 2017 in order to reduce excess retrieval of papers and update the study design filter. We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Eects (DARE) for related systematic reviews and the following databases for primary studies on 31 January 2017: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library; Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA; 2016, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library; NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED; 2015, Issue 2) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE Ovid, including Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process Non-Indexed Citations: 1946 to 31 January Ovid: 1974 to 30 January 2017; CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature): 1981 to 31 January 2017. The search strategies are presented in full in Appendix 1 . Details of the previous search strategies are available in Jacobson Vann 2005 and Jacobson Vann 2008.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.9Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Searching other resources We searched the reference lists of articles and reviews, and the files of study collaborators, for additional studies. Potentially relevant studies were also identified by experts in the field and by prior knowledge. We conducted a grey literature search utilizing the sources below: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality website (www.ahrq.gov): searched March 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov): searched to February 2017; World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch): searched 31 January 2017. We also: screened abstracts and conference proceedings (e.g. handsearching); reviewed the reference lists of included studies, relevant systematic reviews, and primary studies; contacted researchers with expertise relevant to the review topic or EPOC interventions. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies One review author (JJV) screened all titles and abstracts, and two review authors (RMJ, TCB) independently reviewed half of all titles and abstracts. Data extraction and management Two review authors (JJV, RMJ, TCB) independently read and abstracted each potentially relevant study to assess for inclusion using a checklist developed by the Cochrane Eective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) (EPOC 2017 ), and a supplemental form to collect new data elements to meet revised Cochrane guidelines. For each included study, we collected information on study design, study duration, intervention description, outcome measures, study findings, study setting, provider characteristics, participant characteristics, unit of allocation, unit of analysis, ethical approval, power or sample size calculations, and risk of bias assessments (EPOC 2017 ; Higgins 2011 ). We attempted to contact study authors when the data presented were not suiciently detailed to include them in the analyses. One review author (JJV) compared both abstracts for each study and identified disagreements on inclusion and abstraction results. We resolved disagreements between review authors on study inclusion and abstraction results by a formal reconciliation process to achieve consensus. We tracked the review process and status of each article and managed the study-level data using Excel spreadsheets (Excel 2005 ). We assigned unique study identification numbers to support the tracking process. In the current update, we further tracked the major study activities and timelines in a project management system. We entered dichotomous data from included randomized trials into RevMan 5 analysis data tables for intervention type, an overall summary measure, and participant-immunization category:routine childhood, child influenza, other adult, adult influenza, and adolescent vaccinations. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (Higgins 2011 ). We scored each criterion, for each study, as low risk, unclear risk, or high risk of bias. We assessed the risk for the following. Selection bias: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and baseline measurement. Performance bias: blinding of participants and personnel. Detection bias: blinding of outcome assessment. Attrition bias: incomplete outcome data. Reporting bias: selective reporting. Other bias: other sources of bias. The results of our assessment are reported in the 'Risk of bias' tables (Characteristics of included studies), and are summarized by type of bias in our results (Risk of bias in included studies). Measures of treatment eect We used RevMan 5 to analyze data from randomized trials using risk ratios (RRs). We also computed absolute changes in immunizations received, as percentage point dierences between pre-intervention and post-intervention measures because absolute changes are clinically meaningful to practitioners who make decisions about the types of interventions to adopt in their clinical practices. We computed absolute dierences as post-intervention immunization proportions minus pre-intervention immunization proportions for each study group. We compared dierences between study groups. Unit of analysis issues We did not combine data from randomized trials that allocated families, households, practices, or other clusters with trials that allocated individuals. Dealing with missing data When the reported data were insuicient to conduct our meta- analyses, we attempted to contact study authors to obtain additional data, and analyzed all the available data (Pigott 2001 ). We excluded studies from the review if no relevant data were reported, based on the study protocol and minimum methodological inclusion criteria. Assessment of heterogeneity We used random-eects models if Cochrane's Q test detected significant heterogeneity across studies. This test has low sensitivity, so we used a 0.1 significance level. Assessment of reporting biases We assessed for possible reporting biases, including publication bias, using a funnel plot (Egger 1997b). We created a funnel plot for the patient reminder or recall summary measure using the metafor package in R version 3.2.3 (Viechtbauer 2010), and also in RevMan 5 (Analysis 1.1 ), plotting the standard errors of log RRs against RRs (Sterne 2001). We also included a 95% confidence region based on a random-eects model, where absence of bias is indicated by the Patient reminder and recall interventions to improve immunization rates (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.10Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews inclusion of approximately 95% of the studies within this region (Sterne 2004). Data synthesis We combined published data using random-eects meta-analysis for the number of people receiving immunizations. We grouped trials by population, including routine childhood, child influenza, other adult, adult influenza, and adolescent vaccinations, and the type of intervention. For studies with more than one patient reminder or with similar intervention types, such as two postcards groups with dierent messages, we combined intervention group data. For randomized trials with outcomes reported in multiple outcome categories, we reported each outcome separately by reminder type and combined data for the summary measure. For randomized trials with interventions delivered over time and multiple data collection points, we used average sample sizes. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in RevMan for individual studies or study comparisons to assess the eect of patient reminder or recall interventions on receipt of immunizations. We computed pooled RRs and risk dierences for each intervention type, and stratified the results within each intervention type by the five participant-immunization categories. For example, we computed an overall pooled random-eects RR for letter interventions, then stratified relevant study comparisons for participant-immunization category. Summary of findings We summarized the findings of the main intervention comparison(s) for the most important outcome(s), specifically receipt of immunizations for each intervention type and participant-immunization categories in two 'Summary of findings' tables. Two review authors (JJV, JKAA) independently assessed the certainty of the evidence or confidence in the estimate (high, moderate, low, and very low) for each outcome and intervention type using GRADE (BMJ 2016 ; Ryan 2016; Sch\u00fcnemann 2011 ). Our assessment included study design, risk of bias, inconsistency of eect size, indirectness, imprecision, and other considerations, including publication bias (EPOC 2017b ). We present the certaintyof evidence assessment results in GRADE evidence profiles (Appendix 2 ) and the 'Summary of findings' tables (Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary of findings 2). Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity We structured the table of comparisons in RevMan 5 to examine study results, using RRs, by type of patient reminder or recall intervention and created subcategories within each intervention type, to perform subgroup analyses by each of the five participant- immunization categories. Sensitivity analysis We conducted sensitivity analyses for the patient reminder or recall summary measure to assess the eects of two separate methodological decisions in this review. First, we assessed the eect of including versus excluding studies from our analysis with a high risk of bias rating for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and/or incomplete outcome data. Second, we assessed the eect of defining our primary outcome as receipt of any needed immunizations, whether one or all needed immunizations, by omitting studies from the patient reminder or recall summary measure that defined outcomes as up-to-date with all needed immunizations. R E S U L T S Description of studies Results of the search We reviewed 4966 studies for potential inclusion in this review update and retrieved and screened 271 full texts (Figure 1). We included 75 studies, 28 of which we identified during this update (Bangure 2015; Brigham 2012 ; Brown 2016; CDC 2012 ; Chao 2015 ; Daley 2002; Dini 2000 ; Dombkowski 2012; ; Winston 2007) (Characteristics of included studies). /uni00A0 Patient reminder and recall interventions to improve immunization rates (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Figure 1. /uni00A0 Study flow diagram. /uni00A0 Included studies See Characteristics of included studies for full details.Study designs Of the 75 included studies, five used a controlled before and a/f_ter design ( LeBaron 1998; Lemstra 2011; Lieu 1998 ; Margolis 1992; Patient reminder and recall interventions to improve immunization rates (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.12Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Stockwell 2012a). The remaining studies used a randomized trial design. One controlled before-a/f_ter study randomized intervention participants to four study groups; control participants were not randomized (Lieu 1998 ). Fi/f_teen studies allocated participants by area, practice, provider, or family and analyzed data at the patient level. Three studies clustered allocation by local government area, community, practice, or provider and analyzed at the individual person level (Brown 2016; Buington 1991; Ornstein 1991). Twelve studies clustered families, including married couples or siblings, and conducted analyses at the patient level (Dini 2000 ; Frame 1994; Haji 2016 ; One of the 12 studies also analyzed data at the family level; however, it did not present specific family-level data (McDowell 1986 ). Settings Studies were performed in diverse settings, ranging from urban to rural, and public to private to university-based. Examples of study settings are state health departments, health maintenance organizations (HMO), public health departments, urban teaching facilities, private practices, senior centers, rural practices, and schools. Fi/f_ty-eight studies were performed in the US. The remainder were conducted in Australia (two) (Ferson 1995; Puech 1998 Zealand (two) (Satterthwaite 1997; Soljak 1987), the UK (two) (Hull 2002 ; Mason 2000 ), Spain (one) (Roca 2012), Zimbabwe (one) ( Bangure 2015), Kenya (one) (Haji 2016 ), and Nigeria (one) (Brown 2016). Participants We classified participants into five categories based on the types of immunizations received and broad age groups: infants and children needing routine immunizations, children needing influenza vaccination, adolescents, adults needing routine immunizations, and adults needing influenza vaccination. Twenty-nine of the included studies examined routine vaccinations of infants and children (Alto 1994; Bangure 2015; Brown 2016; Campbell 1994 ; CDC 2012 ; Daley 2002; Daley 2004b; Dini 2000 2011; Lieu 1997 ; Lieu 1998 ; Linkins ; Young 1980); and five studied influenza vaccinations among children and infants (Daley 2004a; Dombkowski 2012; Kempe 2005 ; Kemper 1993; Szilagyi 1992). Twenty-four studies assessed the eectiveness of patient reminder or recall interventions on receipt of adult influenza immunizations (Baker 1998; Becker 1989 ; Brimberry 1988; Buchner 1987 ; Buington 1991; Carter 1986 ; Hogg 1998 ; Hull 2002 ; Humiston 2011; Larson 1982; Lukasik 1987 ; Margolis 1992; McDowell assessed the eectiveness of patient reminder or recall on receipt of any or all of adult vaccinations, including tetanus, pneumococcal, hepatitis B, diphtheria tetanus pertussis (Hib), 2007). Twelve studies examined the eect of patient reminder or recall on receipt of adolescent immunizations (Brigham 2012 ; Chao 2015 ; Marron 1998; Szilagyi 2013). The total number of studies described by target population-immunization category exceeds the 75 included studies because several studies examined more than one category. Interventions Fourteen studies examined the eect of immunization reminder person-to-person telephone calls on receipt of immunizations (Brigham 2012 ; Brimberry 1988; Brown 2016; Ferson ; Vivier 2000 ; Winston 2007). Thirty- two studies examined the eect of immunization reminder or recall letters to patients or parents on receipt of immunization (Brimberry 1988; Campbell 1994 ; Carter 1986; CDC 2012 ; Chao 2015 ; Daley 2004a; Dini 2000 ; Dombkowski 2012; Dombkowski 2014 ; Hogg 1998 ; Kempe 2005; 1993; Lieu 1997 ; Lieu 1998 ; Marron 1998; Mason 2000 ; McCaul 2002 ; Mullooly 1980). Ten studies assessed the eect of immunization reminder or recall postcards on immunization receipt (Baker 1998; Buchner 1987 ; Campbell 1994 ; Irigoyen 2006; 1991). Six studies examined the eect of text messages on immunization receipt (Bangure 2015; Haji Stockwell 2012a). Seven studies assessed the eect of immunization reminder or recall autodialer interventions on immunization receipt (Dini 2000 ; Lieu 1998 ; Linkins 1994 ; Rand 2017 ; Stehr-Green 1993; Szilagyi 2006; Szilagyi 2013). Nine studies examined the eect of some combination of letter or postcard plus telephone or autodialer on immunization receipt (Alto 1994; Daley 2002 ; Daley 2004b; Dini 2000 ; Kempe 2001; LeBaron 1998; Lieu 1998 ; Suh 2012 ; Vivier 2000 ). Seven studies examined the eect of some combination of patient reminder or recall with outreach on immunization receipt (Hambidge 2009; LeBaron 1998 ). included six randomized trials that examined the eect of provider reminders, combined with patient reminder or recall interventions, on immunization receipt (Becker 1989; Buington 1991 ; Frame 1994; Humiston 2011; Ornstein 1991; Rodewald 1999), and one controlled before-a/f_ter study (Margolis 1992). The duration of the intervention, per participant, ranged from a momentary reminder or recall at a point in time to interventions delivered intermittently over an approximate one-year time period for multiple vaccinations. The total number of studies sorted by intervention type exceeds the 75 included studies because many studies had more than one intervention arm. Excluded studies We briefly describe the reasons individual studies were excluded from our review in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.

Allocation concealment We classified the potential risk for selection bias, based on concealment of allocation, as low risk in 44.0 per cent (33 studies) (Bangure 2015; Brigham 2012 ; Brimberry 1988; 1993; LeBaron 2004 Lieu 1997 ; Linkins 1994 ; Mason 2000 ; Moniz 2013 ; O'Leary 2015 ; Puech 1998 ; 2000 2007; Wood 1998 ). We classified allocation concealment as unclear risk in 42.7 per cent (32 studies) (Alto 1994; Baker 1998; Becker 1989; Brown 2016 ; Buchner 1987 ; Buington 1991; Campbell 1994 ; Carter 1986; Chao 2015 ; Daley 2004b; Dini 2000 ; Ferson 1995; Frame and we classified it as high risk in 13.3 per cent (10 studies; Stockwell 2012a; Tollestrup 1991). Baseline measurement We classified the risk for selection bias, based on baseline measurement of outcomes and participant characteristics, as low risk in 69.3 per cent (52 studies) (Alto 1994; Baker 1998; Bangure 2015 ; Becker 1989; Brigham 2012 ; Brimberry 1988; Campbell 1994 ; Carter 1986; CDC 2012 ; Chao 2015 ; Daley 2002; Daley 2004a; Daley 2004b ; Dini 2000 ; Dombkowski 2012; Dombkowski 2014; Frame 1994 ; Humiston 2011; Kempe Wood 1998 ). We classified the risk as unclear in 24.0 per cent (18 studies) (Buchner 1987 ; Buington 1991; Hambidge 2009 ; Irigoyen 2006; Lieu 1998 ; Margolis 1992; Mason 2000 ; Moran 1992 ; Stehr-Green 1993 ; Young 1980), and we classified it as high risk in 6.7 per cent (five studies) (Brown 2016; Ferson 1995; Hogg 1998 ; Larson 1982; Ornstein 1991). Blinding We classified the potential risk for performance bias, based on blinding of participants and personnel, as low risk in 28.0 per cent (21 studies) (Brimberry 1988; Campbell 1994 ; CDC 2012 ; Daley 2002; Daley 2004a; Daley 2004b; Hull 2002 ; Kempe 2001; 2013; Winston 2007). We classified the risk of performance bias, based on blinding of participants and personnel, as unclear in 66.7 per cent (50 studies) (Alto 1994; Baker 1998; Bangure 2015 ; Becker 1989; Brigham 2012 ; Brown 2016; Buchner 1987 ; Buington 1991; Carter 1986; Chao 2015 Dini 2011; Lieu 1997 ; Lieu Linkins 1994 ; Margolis 1992; Marron 1998; ; Wood 1998 ; Young 1980), and we classified it as high risk in 5.3 per cent (four studies; Kemper 1993; LeBaron 1998; Lukasik 1987; Rosser 1992). We classified the potential risk for detection bias, based on blinded assessment of primary outcomes, as low risk in 29.3 per cent (22 studies) (Baker 1998; Brigham 2012 ; CDC 2012 ; Daley 2002; Daley 2004a; Daley 2004b; Winston 2007). We classified the risk of detection bias as unclear in 68.0 per cent (51 studies) (Alto 1994; Bangure 2015; Buington 1991; Campbell 1994 ; Carter 1986; Chao 2015 Lukasik 1987; Margolis 1992; Marron 1998; Mason 2000 Wood 1998 ; Young 1980), and we classified it as high risk in 2.7 per cent (two studies; Humiston 2011; LeBaron 2004). Incomplete outcome data We classified the potential risk for attrition bias, based on the degree of participant follow-up and complete outcome data, as low risk in 58.7 per cent (44 studies) (Bangure 2015; Brigham 2012 Dombkowski Wood 1998 ). We classified the risk for attrition bias as unclear in 38.7 per cent (29 studies) (Alto 1994; Baker 1998 ; Becker 1989; Chao 2015 ; Daley 2002; Daley 2004b; Dini 2000 Ferson Lemstra 2011; ; Margolis 1992 ; Marron 1998; McDowell 1986; Moniz 2013 ; 2015; Young 1980), and high risk in 2.7 per cent (two studies) (Buchner 1987 ; Frame 1994).

Eects of interventions See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Overview: Patient reminder or recall interventions for receipt of immunizations - any kind; Summary of findings 2 Summary: Patient reminder or recall interventions by type of immunization Patient reminder or recall See Summary of findings for the main comparison and Summary of findings 2 . Patient reminder or recall interventions, which are patient-focused, probably increase the number of immunizations (risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 1.35; 55 trials; 138,625 participants) with moderate certainty evidence (Summary of findings for the main comparison; Analysis 1.1 ). Fourteen studies were included in the review but not included in the meta-analyses because these studies generally randomized families, households, practices, or communities (Brown 2016; Dini 2000 ; Frame 1994; Haji 2016 ; Lukasik 1987; McDowell In seven of these 14 studies, the proportion of intervention group participants receiving immunizations was at least 20 percentage points higher than among controls (Brown studies intervention eects ranged from at least 10 to less than 20 percentage points (Buington 1991; Haji 2016 ; McDowell 1986 ; Ornstein 1991; Spaulding 1991; Szilagyi 2011); and in four studies the intervention eect sizes were less than a 10 percentage point increase over controls (Dini 2000 ; Ornstein 1991 ; Puech 1998 ; Szilagyi 2013). Three additional studies are also analyzed separately because they are controlled before-a/f_ter studies (LeBaron 1998; Lemstra 2011; Margolis 1992). Dierences in improvements, among controlled before and a/f_ter studies, inpre-intervention to post-intervention immunization rates between intervention and control groups did not exceed 15 percentage points. Three studies were not included in the summary meta- analyses because they combined patient and provider reminders (Becker 1989; Buington 1991; Humiston 2011). Dierent types of reminder or recall systems Patient telephone reminder or recall interventions Fourteen included studies evaluated the eect of telephone reminder or recall interventions on receipt of immunizations. Of these studies, seven (9120 participants) were included in the meta- analysis ( Brigham 2012 ; Brimberry 1988; Ferson 1995; Hull 2002 ; Sansom 2003 ; Vivier 2000 ; Winston 2007). The RR was 1.75 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.54) (Analysis 2.1 ). One study was not included because it had a controlled before-a/f_ter study design with unequal baseline immunization levels (Lemstra 2011). In all seven studies not included in the meta-analyses (Brown 1992), receipt of immunizations was higher among participants in the intervention group compared with control participants. In the five studies with adult participants (Frame 1994 ; Lukasik 1987; McDowell 1986; Rosser 1991; Rosser 1992), influenza, tetanus diphtheria (Td), and tetanus immunization rates were 20.0 to 27.2 percentage points higher among intervention participants compared with controls. In one controlled before-a/f_ter study of children who had not received two MMR vaccinations by two years of age, pre-intervention to post-intervention increases in immunization receipt was 3.9 percentage points higher among children in the telephone reminder group compared with controls (Lemstra 2011). Patient telephone reminder or recall interventions probably improve receipt of immunizations based on moderate certainty evidence (Summary of findings for the main comparison). Patient letter reminder or recall interventions Letter reminder or recall interventions were evaluated in 32 included studies and more than 40 per cent of the comparisons overall. Of these, we included 26 studies (81,100 participants) in the meta-analyses (Brimberry 1988; Campbell 1994 ; Carter 1986 ; CDC 2012 ; Chao 2015 ; Daley 2004a; Dombkowski 1997 ; Lieu 1998 ; Marron 1998; Mason 2000 ; McCaul 2002 ; Moran 1980 ). Intervention participants in letter reminder or recall groups were 1.29 times more likely to receive immunizations than control group participants (95% CI 1.21 to 1.38) (Analysis 3.1 ). Six studies were excluded from meta-analyses because they allocated families, households, clinicians, or practices (Dini 2000 ; McDowell 1986; Ornstein 1991; Rosser 1991; Rosser 1992; Szilagyi 2013). The eectiveness of letter reminder and recall interventions in improving receipt of immunizations varied between and within target population and immunization categories. All five comparisons for letter reminder or recall interventions increased child influenza vaccination rates (Daley 2004a; Dombkowski 2012; Kempe 2005; 1.08 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.12) to 4.60 (95% CI 1.66 to 12.74).

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews immunization rates (Campbell 1994 ; CDC 2012 ; Lieu 1997 ; Lieu 1998 ; Mason 2000 ; Oeinger 1992; Vivier 2000 ; Young 1980); RRs for letter interventions and childhood vaccinations ranged from 0.85 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.90) to 5.07 (95% CI 1.14 to 22.60). Nine of 11 comparisons involving adult influenza vaccinations increased immunization rates (Baker 1998; Brimberry 1988; 1985); risk ratios ranged from 0.91 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.19) to 3.11 (95% CI 1.16 to 8.36). Studies recruiting adults increased other immunizations (RR 3.13, 95% CI 1.44 to 6.84) (Hogg 1998 ; Siebers 1985). Those recruiting adolescents also increased immunizations (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 5.11) (Chao 2015 ; Marron 1998 ). One randomized trial evaluated the eectiveness of a mailed informational letter on hepatitis B vaccination rates among freshman college students (RR 3.31, 95% CI 1.81 to 6.05) (Marron 1998 ). The letter was sent to both students and parents; the mailing also included a reminder card with a hepatitis B logo and the appointment telephone number. Vaccination rates for the first hepatitis B dose were 8.1 percentage points higher among participants compared with controls and 10.1 percentage points higher for the second dose. However, control group hepatitis B vaccination rates were very low: 3.6 per cent and 1.9 per cent for the first and second doses respectively. In the six studies that we excluded from meta-analyses because they allocated families, households, clinicians, or practices, receipt of immunizations was higher among participants in intervention groups compared with control groups (Dini 2000 ; McDowell 1986; Ornstein 1991; Rosser 1991; Rosser 1992; Szilagyi 2013). In the three studies and four comparisons with adult participants, influenza and tetanus immunization outcomes were 25.3 to 27.4 percentage points higher among intervention participants compared with controls (McDowell 1986; Rosser 1991; Rosser 1992). In one study of adolescents routine vaccination outcomes were 6 percentage points higher among comparison participants compared with controls (Szilagyi 2013). In one study of childhood vaccinations outcomes were 7.3 percentage points higher among intervention participants compared with controls (Dini 2000 ). For studies of letter reminder or recall interventions, we assigned a GRADE of moderate when assessing the certainty of evidence (Summary of findings for the main comparison), because of inconsistency in the findings, variation in the delivery and content of letter reminder or recall interventions, and imprecision attributable to wide confidence intervals for several studies (Appendix 2 ). Patient letter reminder or recall interventions probably improve receipt of immunizations. Patient postcard reminder or recall interventions Postcard reminder or recall interventions were evaluated in 10 included studies. Of these, we included eight in the meta-analyses (27,734 participants) (Baker 1998; Buchner 1987 ; excluded two studies from meta-analyses because they allocated couples or families (Puech 1998 ; Spaulding 1991). Participants in postcard reminder or recall intervention groups, for the seven studies, were more likely to receive immunization (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.30) (Analysis 4.1 ). Two studies that we excluded from meta-analyses reported an increase in adult influenza immunization rates of 9.5 and 16.1 percentage points higher in the intervention groups comparedwith controls, respectively (Puech 1998 ; Spaulding 1991). Patient postcard reminder or recall interventions improve receipt of immunizations, with a high certainty of evidence (Summary of findings for the main comparison). Patient text message reminder or recall interventions Seven studies with text message interventions were included, and data from six contributed to the meta-analysis (7772 participants) (Bangure 2015; Rand 2017; Stockwell 2012a). Participants in the text message groups were more likely to receive immunizations than control group participants (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.44) (Analysis 5.1 ). Patient text message reminder or recall interventions improve receipt of immunizations based on high certainty evidence (Summary of findings for the main comparison) (Appendix 2 ). Patient autodialer reminder or recall interventions Seven studies evaluated the eectiveness of autodialer reminder or recall interventions on receipt of immunizations. Among the five studies included in meta-analyses (11,947 participants), participants in the autodialer intervention groups were more likely to receive immunizations than control group participants (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32 (Analysis 6.1 ) (Lieu 1998 ; Linkins 1994 ; Rand 2017 ; Stehr-Green 1993; Szilagyi 2006). All five studies reported positive findings. Two autodialer studies were not included in the meta-analyses and are reported qualitatively because they allocated families or households (Dini 2000 ; Szilagyi 2013). One study assessed the eect of autodialer reminder and recall messages on immunization coverage during the first two years of life for children who had received the first dose of DTP or poliovirus vaccines (Dini 2000 ). One reminder message was sent before a scheduled immunization visit; a weekly recall message was sent a/f_ter the scheduled date for up to four weeks. Immunization receipt, at 24 months of age, was 8.4 percentage points higher among the autodialer group compared with the no notification control group. A second study evaluated the eect of centralized autodialer reminder and recall interventions on immunization receipt among low-income adolescents (Szilagyi 2013). Messages were sent at 10- week intervals for Tdap vaccine, MCV4 and the first dose of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, and at five-week intervals for HPV-2 and HPV-3. Immunization receipt at the end of the study was 3 percentage points higher among autodialer participants compared with controls. Patient autodialer message reminder or recall interventions improve receipt of immunizations based on high certainty evidence (Summary of findings for the main comparison) (Appendix 2 ). Patient portal-based reminder or recall interventions No studies with immunization reminder or recall interventions within secure online patient portal systems met our inclusion criteria. Combination patient mail and telephone reminder or recall interventions ('mail and phone') Interventions that included a combination of postcards or letters and telephone or autodialer messages were evaluated in nine included studies. Of these studies, we included eight in meta- analyses (6506 participants) (Alto 1994; Daley 2002; Daley 2004b; Patient reminder and recall interventions to improve immunization rates (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.20Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Kempe 2001; LeBaron Lieu 1998 ; Suh 2012 ; Vivier 2000 ). We excluded one study from analyses because it allocated children within a household ( Dini 2000 ). Intervention participants that received this combination intervention were 1.28 times more likely to receive immunizations than control group participants (95% CI 1.14 to 1.45) (Analysis 7.1 ). The study not included in meta-analyses evaluated the eect of autodialer messages, followed by letters, on receipt of all needed immunizations at 24 months of age (Dini 2000 ). Immunization receipt was 9.3 percentage points higher among intervention children compared with controls. A combination of patient mail and telephone reminder or recall interventions probably improves receipt of immunizations with moderate certainty of the evidence (Summary of findings for the main comparison). Combination patient reminder or recall with outreach interventions Seven studies examined the eect of combined patient reminder and outreach interventions on immunization outcomes. Of these studies, we included three in meta-analyses (2701 participants) (Hambidge 2009; LeBaron 2004; Wood 1998 ). We excluded two from analyses for allocating families or households (Rodewald 1999 ; Szilagyi 2011). We excluded two studies with controlled before and a/f_ter study designs (LeBaron 1998; Lemstra 2011). Intervention participants for three studies included in the meta- analysis were more likely to receive immunizations than control group participants (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.35) (Analysis 8.1 ). Three of four studies not included in meta-analysis reported pre-intervention to post-intervention increases in receipt of vaccinations that were 12.3 to 21.0 percentage points higher among intervention participants compared with control participants (LeBaron 1998; Rodewald 1999; Szilagyi 2011). The fourth study not included in analyses compared telephone reminders combined with an oer to have a public health nurse vaccinate the child during a home visit to a telephone reminder only control group (Lemstra 2011). A combination of patient reminder or recall with outreach interventions improves receipt of immunizations based on high certainty evidence; however, the small number of studies in this subgroup is a potential concern (Summary of findings for the main comparison) (Appendix 2 ). Combination patient reminder or recall and provider reminder interventions Six studies assessed the eect of patient reminder or recall combined with provider reminder interventions on receipt of immunizations (Becker Rodewald 1999). We included three comparisons from two of the six studies in the meta-analyses (4120 participants) (Becker 1989; Humiston 2011). Intervention group participants were more likely to receive immunizations than control group participants (RR 2.91, 95% CI 2.67 to 3.19) (Analysis 9.1). We excluded four studies from analyses: three randomized trials because they randomized practices, providers, families, or households ( Buington 1991; Ornstein 1991; Rodewald 1999), and one controlled before and a/f_ter study (Margolis 1992). The three randomized trials not included in the meta-analyses reported increases in immunization receipt that were 13.4 to 21 percentage points higher among intervention groups compared with control groups. The controlled before and a/f_ter study reported mixedresults that varied by clinic, with the following pre-intervention to post-intervention changes in immunization outcomes: a 16 percentage point increase in one intervention clinic; a 5 percentage point decrease in a second intervention clinic; a 3 percentage point increase in one control clinic; and a 4 percentage point decrease in a second control clinic (Margolis 1992). A combination of patient reminder or recall with provider reminder interventions probably improves receipt of immunizations based on moderate certainty evidence (Summary of findings for the main comparison) (Appendix 2 ). Patient reminder or recall interventions in dierent immunization types and patient populations Childhood immunizations Childhood immunizations, excluding influenza vaccinations, were the focus of 29 included studies. In the 23 studies included in the meta-analysis (31,099 participants), children in reminder or recall intervention groups were more likely to receive routine immunizations than children in control groups (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.29) (Analysis 1.1 ). We excluded four eligible randomized trials from the meta- analyses because they allocated households, families, practices, or geographic areas (Brown 2016; Dini 2000 ; Haji 2016 ; Rodewald 1999 ). In one of these studies immunization receipt at 24 months of age was 7.3 to 9.3 percentage points higher in the intervention groups than in the control group (Dini 2000 ). In the second study, immunization receipt was 21 percentage points higher in the intervention groups compared with the control group (Rodewald 1999). Two controlled before-a/f_ter studies were not included in the meta-analysis (LeBaron 1998; Lemstra 2011). One reported a 15 percentage point increase in immunization rates among intervention participants and no change in the control group (LeBaron 1998). The other controlled before and a/f_ter study enrolled children who had not received two MMR vaccinations by two years of age; the pre-intervention to post-intervention increase in MMR vaccination receipt was 6.6 percentage points in the intervention group and 2.7 percentage points in the control group (Lemstra 2011). Patient reminder or recall interventions improve receipt of childhood vaccinations based on high certainty evidence (Summary of findings 2) (Appendix 2 ). Childhood influenza immunizations Five included studies (9265 participants), focusing on childhood influenza vaccinations, reported an increase in immunizations (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.99) 2012 ; Kempe 2005; Kemper 1993; Szilagyi 1992). In three studies improvement in receipt of influenza immunization was 17 to 26 percentage points higher among intervention groups compared with controls (Daley 2004a; Kemper 1993; Szilagyi 1992). One study examined the eect of patient reminder and recall letters on receipt of influenza vaccination for healthy six- to 23-month old children (Kempe 2005), in contrast to the previous studies, which targeted children with high-risk conditions. This study reported the lowest RR (1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12) of this subgroup analysis and reported several limitations, including a vaccine shortage, a pandemic with extensive media coverage, and the use of a telephone survey prior to the intervention to assess attitudes and intentions regarding Patient reminder and recall interventions to improve immunization rates (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.21Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews influenza vaccination (Kempe 2005). Another study tested the eect of letter reminders on increasing influenza vaccination rates among children, aged 24 to 60 months, with chronic conditions and served by local health departments (Dombkowski 2012). The post-intervention immunization rates were higher among the intervention group compared with the control group (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.46; risk dierence of 6.5%). Patient reminder or recall interventions probably improve receipt of childhood influenza vaccinations with moderate certainty of evidence (Summary of findings 2) (Appendix 2 ). Adult immunizations - other than influenza or travel ('other adult') Eight included randomized trials (8065 participants) examined the relationship between patient reminder or recall interventions and routine adult immunizations, including tetanus, pneumococcal, hepatitis B, DTP, Hib, MMR, 2003 ; Siebers 1985 ; Winston 2007). The RR for the four studies included in the meta-analyses was 2.08 (95% CI 0.91 to 4.78) (Analysis (Hogg 1998 ; Sansom 2003 ; Siebers 1985; Winston 2007). We excluded four of the eight included randomized trials from meta-analyses because they allocated families or providers (Frame 1994 ; Ornstein 1991; Rosser 1991; Rosser 1992). In three of these studies the tetanus or Td immunization rates among participants in the letter or telephone intervention groups were at least 20 percentage points higher than for controls (Frame 1994; Rosser 1991 ; Rosser 1992). The fourth study evaluated the eect of a computer-generated letter, alone or combined with provider reminders, on rates of adult tetanus vaccination rates (Ornstein 1991 ). The post-intervention vaccination rates were 3.6 percentage points higher in the letter only group compared with controls; this increased to 13.4 percentage points when the letter was combined with provider reminders (Ornstein 1991). Patient reminder or recall interventions may improve receipt of adult vaccinations other than influenza and travel based on low certainty evidence (Summary of findings 2) (Appendix 2 ). Adult influenza immunizations Twenty-four included studies examined the relationship between patient reminder or recall interventions and receipt of adult influenza immunizations. Of these, we included 15 studies in the meta-analysis (59,328 participants) (Baker 1998; Brimberry 1988; Buchner 1987 ; Carter 1986; Hogg 1998 ; Hull 2002 ; Larson 1982;McCaul 2002 ; Moniz 2013 ; 1985). We included two studies in the patient reminder or recall combined with provider reminders analysis (Becker 1989; Humiston 2011). We excluded six randomized trials from analyses because they randomized households, families, clinicians, or practices (Buington Spaulding 1991 ), which could not be adjusted for in our analyses. We excluded one controlled before and a/f_ter study from meta-analysis. The pooled random-eects RR for the 15 studies in this subgroup analysis was 1.29 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.43) (Analysis 1.1 ). Among the 15 analyzed studies, risk ratios ranged from 0.91 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.09) to 3.11 (95% CI 1.16 to 3.86). The median OR for the six studies that allocated households, families, clinicians, or practices was 3.08 (Buington 1991; Lukasik 1987; McDowell 1986; Puech 1998 ; Rosser 1991 ; Spaulding 1991). Patient reminder or recall interventions probably improve receipt of adult influenza vaccinations based on moderate certainty evidence (Summary of findings 2) (Appendix 2 ). Adolescent immunizations Twelve included studies evaluated the eect of patient reminder or recall interventions on receipt of immunizations among adolescents (Brigham 2012 ; Chao 2015 ; Marron 1998; O'Leary Of these, 10 (30,868 participants) are included in the patient reminder or recall subgroup meta-analysis (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.42) (Analysis 1.1 ) (Brigham 2012 ; Chao 2015 ; ; Szilagyi 2006). We excluded two studies from the subgroup analysis because they allocated households or families (Szilagyi 2011; Szilagyi 2013). All 12 studies of adolescents reported higher percentage point changes in receipt of immunizations among intervention groups compared with control groups; these dierences ranged from 0.6 to 18 percentage points. Patient reminder or recall interventions improve receipt of adolescent vaccinations based on high certainty evidence (Summary of findings 2). Assessment of reporting biases There is no evidence of reporting bias, as suggested in the funnel plot (Figure 3), based on the inclusion of approximately 95% of the studies within the 95% confidence region (Sterne 2004). /uni00A0 Patient reminder and recall interventions to improve immunization rates (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Figure 3. /uni00A0 Funnel plot of comparison: Patient reminder or recall summary measure versus control /uni00A0 Sensitivity analysis Both sensitivity analyses tend to support the robustness of our primary analyses. In our first sensitivity analysis, we examined the eect of excluding studies from our patient reminder recall summary measure analysis with a high risk of bias rating for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and/or incomplete outcome data. We removed eight studies (Buchner 1987 ; Hogg 1998 ; Lieu 1998 ; Oeinger 1992; Sansom 2003 ; Soljak 1987 ; Stockwell 2012a; Tollestrup 1991), recalculated the pooled random-eects RRs, and compared these results with the RRs calculated prior to deleting the eight studies. The RRs were nearly identical for the overall summary measure, childhood, adult, adult influenza subgroup, and adolescent subgroups; and were identical for the childhood influenza subgroup (Table 1). The overall patientreminder recall RR was 1.28 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.3) when including all studies, versus 1.29 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.36) a/f_ter excluding studies with a high risk of bias rating for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and/or incomplete outcome data. In our second sensitivity analysis, we examined the eect of our decision to define our primary outcome as receipt of needed immunizations, whether one or multiple. We computed RRs and CIs a/f_ter removing nine studies from the patient reminder or recall summary measure that defined the primary outcome as 'up-to- date' with all needed immunizations 2000 ; Wood 1998 ).

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews nine studies from the meta-analyses ('a/f_ter'), the before and a/f_ter RRs were very similar for the overall measure, and childhood immunizations and adolescent immunization subgroups. The other subgroups were unchanged. The overall patient reminder recall RR was 1.28 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.35) when including the full set of articles, versus 1.32 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.39) a/f_ter excluding studies with primary outcomes measured as receiving all needed immunizations. D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results We found that reminder and recall systems were eective for children, adolescents, and adults, in all types of medical or health settings, including private practices, academic medical centers, and public health department clinics, and for universally recommended vaccinations such as routine childhood vaccinations, as well as targeted vaccinations, such as influenza vaccine. In addition, all types of patient reminder and recall were found to be eective, with increases in immunization rates tending to range from 5 to 20 percentage points higher in the intervention groups compared with controls. Telephone reminders were the most eective single intervention type, followed by letter reminders, which were somewhat more eective than text message, postcard, and autodialer interventions. In general, combinations of patient reminder or recall interventions, including patient reminder or recall combined with outreach or some type of mailing combined with telephone calls, were not observed to be as eective as the telephone or letter intervention studies included in the meta-analyses. However, some single type reminder or recall interventions used repeated contacts, which may have provided them the same expected advantages as combination interventions. Patient reminder or recall combined with provider reminder systems were the most eective intervention category in this review; however, the number of studies was small. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence Our systematic review is comprehensive in terms of including all known types of patient reminder or recall interventions and all routine immunization types. We focused primarily on strategies to increase immunizations in non-institutional settings because provider-based interventions may be more applicable than patient reminder or recall interventions in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. This study has several potential limitations. First, the scope of the review was limited to studies published in English. The potential eect of limiting included studies to English language is mixed. At least one study has found that randomized trials published in English were more likely to have positive findings than studies published in German journals (Egger 1997). However, such language bias was not noted in another study (Heidenreich 1999 ). A study of meta-analyses, which included five or more trials with binary outcomes and used comprehensive literature searches, found English-language trials were more likely to have more study participants, be of higher quality methodologically, and be less likely to produce positive results (Juni 2002 ). The estimates of treatment eects were, on average, 16% more beneficial in non-English language trials compared with English language trials (Juni 2002 ). A second systematic review, focusing on systematic reviews of conventional medical care, found that none of thestudies showed major dierences in reported treatment eects when comparing those that included versus excluded non-English language studies (Morrison 2012 ). Second, it is possible that the eect of some types of reminders might diminish in the current world in which phone calls, autodialer calls, and even email and text messages are widespread. Some of these interventions may be included as 'standard practice' in the control groups, leading to attenuated findings. Or, as use of technologies changes, it may alter the way in which people respond to dierent message delivery modes. A third potential limitation is publication bias, because the majority of studies in this review were located from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, other bibliographic databases, and references from other studies. Publication bias typically results in failure to publish studies with negative or null findings (Chalmers 1990 ; Dickerson 1992; Easterbrook 1991), therefore it is possible that our findings of positive outcomes in the majority of reviewed studies is partly aected by publication bias, and that the eect of reminder and recall is lower than noted in this review. We attempted to minimize publication bias by searching the files of the review authors and immunization experts, searching references of published reviews for abstracts, and reviewing abstracts or proceedings of major scientific meetings. In addition, funnel plot analyses did not detect publication bias, thereby increasing the plausibility of our positive findings. We conducted searches of grey literature and a clinical trials register to try to identify unpublished studies. A fourth limitation resulted from omitting studies from the meta- analyses that allocated families, households, clinicians, practices, or communities. Fi/f_teen generally well-designed studies, included in the initial review and meta-analyses, were omitted from the current analyses because they randomized families, households, providers, practices, or communities and analyzed patient-level data. While studies of health practice interventions, such as reminder or recall, can minimize contamination by randomizing at the practice level rather than the individual level, and many of these studies did that, reminder or recall of vaccines cannot avoid the eect on household members who may undergo vaccination as a result. That behavior may aect the measured outcomes of the study, but our meta-analysis could not control or adjust for this eect on household members. Most of the studies in this review were performed in health systems of developed countries in settings in which the potential recipients generally have primary care providers who they see on a regular or as-needed basis and are followed over time. The providers could be public or private, physicians, nurse practitioners, or other health services experts, generalists, or more specialized providers, such as pediatricians in the US. The cornerstone is that there is a population of potential recipients who would need annual influenza vaccinations, or periodic vaccinations on some schedule, in the case of children. In many developing countries or regions, such a situation does not exist and although health services providers do serve patients, there is little ability to determine the population of eligible vaccine recipients. Thus reminder or recall interventions are found primarily in higher-income countries (WHO Working Group 2014). However, a few studies have been done which, while not eligible for inclusion in our systematic review, show promising results in terms of acceptability, including Guatemala (Domek 2016 ), and Nigeria (Brown 2015). Furthermore, Patient reminder and recall interventions to improve immunization rates (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.24Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews a few studies, while of low quality, have been conducted in low- income countries and found an overall positive, albeit relatively low, eect of reminders or recalls on immunizations (Muehleisen 2007 ; Usman 2009; Usman 2011; WHO Working Group 2014). More recently, a randomized trial in Zimbabwe found positive eects of reminders or recalls on immunization (Bangure 2015). However, in virtually all settings in which patient reminder and recall interventions were rigorously evaluated, and these settings were generally those in which patients were connected with a health system, the reminder and recall systems were found to be eective in improving immunization rates. Our review does not include cost data to address questions of cost- eectiveness. The costs of patient reminder or recall interventions were reported in 16 studies, including eight pediatric studies (Campbell 1994 ; Lieu 1997 ; Lieu 1998 ; Linkins 1994 ; Rodewald 1999; Stehr-Green 1993; Wood 1998 ; Young 1980), and six studies of adults (Baker 1998; Buchner 1987 ; Hull 2002 ; McDowell 1986; Nexoe 1997 ; Rosser 1992). Eight studies estimated the cost-eectiveness of reminder and recall systems (LeBaron 2004; Lieu 1997 ; Lieu 1998 ; McDowell 1986; Rodewald 1999; Rosser 1992; Young 1980). Costs varied widely across studies, due to variability in methods of calculating costs and items included in analyses, such as existing sta or computer programming; dierent types of reminders used; dierent levels of intensity of interventions, from single postcard reminders to repeated reminders plus home visits; and dierent study time periods. As a result of the limited cost data reported and variations in the methods, the cost information is of limited use and is not reported. We did not track studies reporting cost data in the current review. Finally, it is important to note that even relatively small eect sizes for interventions aimed at increasing immunizations are clinically meaningful because vaccinations are recommended for virtually every individual at some point. Therefore, even a small eect of a patient reminder or recall intervention, if scaled to a population level, might have a large beneficial eect on public health. Certainty of the evidence We assessed the certainty of the evidence in the estimate for each outcome and intervention type in our review using GRADE (Appendix 2 ). The GRADE assessment for our overall patient reminder recall summary measure was moderate (3; Appendix 2 ) rather than high because of some inconsistencies in the findings, with a few eect size outliers in each direction, and variation in the type of reminder or recall delivery mechanisms and messages, and because of some imprecision for several included study arms (Appendix 2 ). However, we consider the results to be of moderate certainty because of consistency of the estimates of eect for this outcome from our previous reviews, and the positive findings for all patient reminder or recall intervention types individually. We rated the certainty of the evidence as high in four intervention subgroups (postcard; text message; autodialer; combination patient reminder or recall with outreach) and moderate for four subgroups (telephone; letter; combination of mail and phone; combination patient reminder or recall and provider reminder). We rated the certainty of the evidence as high in the childhood and adolescent vaccination subgroup analyses, moderate in the childhood and adult influenza vaccination sub-analyses, and low in the other adult vaccination sub-analysis. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for other adult vaccinations because onlyfour studies were included in this subgroup, risk ratios ranged from 1.08 to 3.61, and some imprecision was observed in two studies. In general, the risk of bias was not serious for the majority of our 75 included studies, with one of eight risk of bias criteria rated as high in 11 studies, two criteria rated as high in nine studies, and three criteria rated as high in three studies. Fi/f_ty-two included studies had ratings of low or unclear risk of bias for all nine criteria. Potential biases in the review process Our review process has potential limitations with respect to our method of pooling data, particularly in light of heterogeneity of some of the data, which is o/f_ten present in meta-analyses (Gottlieb 1982 ; Thompson 1991 ). These reminder or recall studies were performed in a variety of populations, using dierent interventions, in multiple settings, targeting dierent types and numbers of immunizations, and across five decades; therefore it is not surprising that there is between-study heterogeneity in the results. Indeed, we found heterogeneity in study components. Populations ranged from infants due for their well-child visit vaccinations, to adolescents past due for the human papillomavirus vaccine, to older adults due for influenza or pneumococcal vaccines, and adults who had not received the influenza vaccination during the prior year. Some study populations represented the general public, while others targeted those at high risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Some populations represented practice panels, whereas others a specific geographical region. The interventions varied by mode, including telephone, letter, postcard, text message, and autodialer, and intensity, in terms of number as well as perhaps tone, and complexity, from single to step-wise interventions. Text messages, as a medium, introduce another source for heterogeneity across studies - that is, self-selection - because these studies required patients or their parents to provide their cell phone numbers and specifically approve text messaging for this intervention. By necessity, our investigation could not separate high-intensity interventions from low-intensity interventions. Studies that employed more than one study arm, where one arm used a high-intensity intervention and a second used a low-intensity intervention, contributed to the meta-analysis with the average of their eect. Similarly, the control groups diered somewhat in terms of the types of other practice, media, and community- based interventions that may have influenced immunizations. In general, we excluded studies that implemented interventions in the control groups that were expected to have a substantial influence on immunization rates. However, we chose to include a few studies with lower-intensity interventions in the control group if they were standard practice, thereby potentially diminishing the observed eect (Carter 1986; Ferson 1995; LeBaron 2004). Some concerns with control group exposure are not very amenable to change, such as external media campaigns, however, some of these factors may have exerted similar influences on intervention and control participants. Our outcomes also varied in terms of the number of immunizations needed per participant and types of immunizations. We defined our primary outcome as receipt of any needed immunizations. In some studies, participants were targeted to receive only one immunization, such as one dose of the influenza vaccine. In some studies participants were targeted to receive a series of the same vaccine, such as human papillomavirus (HPV). In others, especially for children, participants were targeted to receive a series of Patient reminder and recall interventions to improve immunization rates (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

We addressed this, in part, by conducting sub- analyses by participant and immunization type, such as adult influenza, child influenza, and other child vaccinations, which tended to group similar types of outcomes. In addition, we conducted sensitivity analysis to assess whether omitting studies that defined outcomes as up-to-date for immunizations changed our findings; however, our results were very similar a/f_ter removing studies with outcomes defined as up-to-date. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews The findings of our systematic review are similar to other published reviews of patient and parent-focused interventions aimed at increasing receipt of immunizations (Groom 2015; Harvey 2015; Niccolai 2015; Odone 2015 ; Thomas 2014 ; Watterson 2015 ; Williams 2011 ). Groom 2015 examined the eectiveness of immunization information systems in supporting interventions aimed at increasing immunization rates. Of the 240 included studies, 30 focused on client reminder and recall systems. All but one of these were US studies. Thirteen studies measured the eect of intervention on immunization rates; the median absolute percentage point improvement in immunization among these studies was 6 percentage points. Harvey 2015 assessed the eect of parental reminder and recall and education interventions on early childhood immunizations. All intervention types were found to be eective, with mailed and telephone reminders being the most eective, with a risk dierence of 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.19). Niccolai 2015 specifically focused on HPV vaccination among adolescents. Of the 14 included studies, seven examined the eect of reminder and recall systems, four using randomized designs. Interventions included letters, telephone calls, text messages, and outreach visits. Each of the seven studies reported increases in at least one HPV vaccination outcome attributable to the intervention. Odone 2015 focused on the eect of 'new media' interventions, such as text messaging, smart-phone applications, YouTube videos, Facebook, targeted websites and portals, so/f_tware for health professionals, and emails, on vaccination coverage. Most of the 19 included studies were conducted in the US; both text messaging and patient-held web- based portals were found to be somewhat eective in increasing immunization rates. Oyo-Ita 2016 examined the eect of several intervention types on improving immunization coverage among children in low- and middle-income countries. Of the six included studies, one examined the eect of patient immunization cards on immunization rates. This intervention type is not considered to be patient reminder or recall in our review because of the passive nature of the card. Thomas 2014 assessed the eect of patient-focused and other interventions on older adult influenza immunization rates. Of the 57 included randomized trials, four examined the eect of letters, postcards, or telephone calls in immunizations. Odds ratios for patient reminder or recall studies were positive; however, the comparison groups tended to include similar interventions. Last, Williams 2011 studied the eect of interventions aimed at improving immunizations among children in developed countries. Fourteen of 41 intervention arms among 22 studies of parental reminders and recalls showed positive outcomes. The overall median change in immunizations was 11 percentage points, with a range of -11 to 19 percentage points. Positive results were reported for telephone only and combined telephone and mailed interventions (Williams 2011 ).These reviews are briefly outlined in Appendix 3 . It is important to note that some of the systematic reviews had considerable overlap with our review in terms of included studies (Williams 2011 ). Some of these reviews focused on multiple interventions and did not exclude studies with interventions received by control group participants. Our systematic review was the most comprehensive of those examining patient reminder and recall interventions. A U T H O R S ' /uni00A0 C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice The findings from this updated systematic review continue to show that implementing patient reminder and recall systems improve immunization coverage levels in primary care. Evidence from our review is supportive of recommendations from a number of bodies (AdHoc Working Group; Shefer 1999; Task Force 1999; Udovic 1998). In all settings that were evaluated, patient reminder and recall systems appear to be eective for improving immunization rates. As such, methods to incorporate reminder and recall systems into practices should have a positive eect on vaccine-preventable diseases. Dierent types of reminder and recall systems can be tailored to suit specific provider or practice needs. While person- to-person telephone reminders are most eective, they may also be more costly than other methods, and have not been studied extensively in children, except for the use of autodialers, which were found to have smaller but positive eects. However, for this update we identified five new studies that assessed the eect of letter reminder or recall interventions on immunization rates, and one new study focused on childhood influenza vaccination. Practical issues relevant to choices of reminder and recall systems include: characteristics of current computer systems, staing, perceived accuracy of patient telephone numbers or addresses, availability of computer programmers, and estimated patient responsiveness to dierent types of reminders. These factors vary widely across nations or geographic regions; therefore immunization leaders will want to interpret the findings in this review with respect to their own setting. For example, settings with widely used computerized immunization registries could adopt postcard reminders sent by the registries. Practitioners today can tailor their own billing systems to function as reminder and recall systems for simple procedures, such as selecting all patients over 65 years of age for reminders about influenza or pneumococcal vaccination. Many billing systems have recently incorporated separate modules that can track immunization status. A critical issue involves the complexity of 'rules' required for a reminder or recall system. The simplest scenario involves older adults, because no special immunization algorithm is needed, and eligible patients can be selected by birth dates. A slightly more complex scenario involves 'flagging' adult patients with problems such as end-stage renal disease, including those receiving hemodialysis, with HIV infection, or with chronic liver disease that may require hepatitis B vaccinations. More sophisticated algorithms are required to track prior immunization status, particularly for the complicated pediatric immunization schedule. A very promising approach involves vaccine providers recording the administered vaccines in computerized immunization registries shared across the region. These have been developed in many European countries (Johansen 2012 ), as well as Australia (Chin 2012 ), Canada ( Canadian 1998 ), New Zealand (Wansbrough 2009), and the United States (CDC 1998c ; NVAC 1999; USDHHS 2000), and are being developed in various forms in developing nations (Bosch- Patient reminder and recall interventions to improve immunization rates (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.26Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Capblanch 2009 ). These registries already contain the necessary algorithms to assess the up-to-date status of children, and could be modified to deliver patient reminders. Finally, databases of managed care organizations and accountable care organizations can be modified to become reminder and recall systems. For practitioners, the usefulness of such databases depends on the proportion of a practice's patients covered by the managed care plan and the accuracy of the database information. Overall, the technology exists, in the developed world, to incorporate patient reminder and recall into routine primary care practice. There are additional benefits to the patient and practice, beyond improving immunization rates. Studies have shown that patients behind with immunizations are also behind in other measures of preventive care (Fairbrother 1996; Rodewald 1995), and that reminder or recall systems targeting immunizations can also have \"spillover eects\" to improve other aspects of preventive care (Rodewald 1999), if they are used within primary care practices. The use of patient reminder and recall systems provides the primary care practitioner with real-life experience at practicing population-based care, by improving the care for the entire population served by the practice (Halpern 2000 ). Although medicine is traditionally taught and practiced one patient at a time, and preventive services such as immunizations are delivered to individual patients, the measures of success, such as immunization rates, are population-based. Such population-based primary care, while not easy to do in a busy practice, has the potential to improve the quality of care and performance of primary care providers (Halpern 2000 ; OConnor 1998 ; Rivo 1998). Implications for research This study also has implications for research. Again, this updated systematic review includes 28 new studies and addresses two new technologies not addressed previously. They include electronic simple-message system text messages and electronic medical record messages in secured patient portals. As these technologies mature, researchers should consider how they can enhance reminder and recall interventions and what improvements in their eect can be achieved. We suspect that additional new technologies will also debut and researchers should test those platforms as well. Indeed, the Ericsson Mobility Report, published in 2015, reported 7.1 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide in 2014 ( Ericsson 2015 ). That number included 2.6 billion smartphones, telephones with data plans that perform many of the functions of a computer, typically having Internet access and capable of running downloaded applications or apps. Ericsson predicts that in 2020 these numbers will increase to 9.2 and 7.7 billion respectively. That means that in 2020 Ericsson predicts that 70 per cent of the world's population will have a smartphone. Much of the growth will occur in the Middle East and Africa and parts of the Asia Pacific region. Thus the growth of smartphone availability, even in the next five years, promises new opportunities for reminder and recall innovation. With the plethora of studies showing that patient reminder and recall systems improve immunization rates in all types of settings, future researchers should consider not simply repeating prior studies but rather building on them and addressing gaps. For example, only six included studies focused on text message interventions (Bangure 2015; Four of these studies examined text reminders and the eect on Rand 2017; pregnant women and influenza vaccinations (Moniz 2013 ), and one focused on childhood immunizations (Bangure 2015 ). None of these included studies examined the eect of text messages on childhood influenza or other adult vaccinations. The eect sizes were generally positive, with only two demonstrating a relatively strong eect size (Rand 2017; Stockwell 2012a). There is a need to explore the characteristics and intensity of the interventions, target populations, and target immunizations to identify the most eective use of text message reminder and recall interventions. This need to learn more about characteristics of the most eective text message interventions was also a conclusion in a review of systematic reviews (Hall 2015 ), which found text messages to be generally eective in improving several types of health behaviors, such as diabetes, weight loss, physical activity, and smoking cessation. Much of the focus, so far, with reminder and recall interventions is the evaluation of the eect on vaccines received. Reminders, rather than recalls, also have the theoretical ability to maintain a patient with on-time vaccinations, i.e. receipt of vaccinations by the recommended age or time, as opposed to up-to-date, i.e. the number or proportion of the population who have received the vaccine at a certain point in time, whether or not they received the vaccine by the recommended age or time. Researchers should consider testing the eect of patient reminders on on-time vaccination as a particular outcome. Only five included studies examined the eect of reminder and recall interventions on childhood influenza five studies used letter reminders and one used a combination of letter and postcard (Daley 2004a). No included studies examined the use of telephone calls, autodialer, text messages, or other combination interventions on influenza vaccination among children. With approximately 40 percent of children, ages six months to 17 years, not having received the influenza vaccination during the 2014 to 2015 influenza season (CDC 2016b ), it is important to better understand how to improve these rates. Previously we had identified a single study that reviewed adolescent immunization delivery in an urban setting (Szilagyi 2006 ). This study did not demonstrate significant improvement with use of autodialer reminders. However, we have now identified 11 additional studies that examined the eect of reminder and recall interventions on immunization rates among adolescents. These studies examined the eect of letters (Chao 2015 ; Marron 1998 ; Szilagyi 2013), telephone (Brigham 2012 ), autodialer and autodialer (Suh 2012 ), and a tiered reminder or recall with outreach (Szilagyi 2011) on immunization outcomes. With the rising importance of adolescent immunizations and the multiple settings in which adolescents receive care, additional studies of adolescents would be useful for determining which strategies may be most eective. The rapid implementation of computerized immunization registries presents opportunities for research in implementing, on a community-wide basis, reminder and recall interventions Patient reminder and recall interventions to improve immunization rates (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews that appear to be eective in single practice settings. In addition, managed care plans have databases that could be used as the backbone of reminder and recall interventions; studies incorporating such linkages would be helpful. The relatively recent implementation of patient portal systems and secure messaging with patients within these systems is another area to be further explored. None of the patient portal studies we reviewed met the inclusion criteria for this review. Patient portals linking the electronic health record systems, for example, could support reminders and recalls for additional vaccinations based on high- risk indications. Studies about 'fine-tuning' patient reminder and recall interventions would be helpful, such as investigations of the degree to which dierent combinations improve outcomes, or the degree to which combinations of patient reminder and recall and other types of interventions improve outcomes. Finally, because the majority of reviewed studies of patient reminder and recall interventions found positive eects, any studies that do not find improved immunization uptake should carefully investigate the reasons for lack of improvement. Such detailed investigations may uncover important barriers to care delivery that are likely to be useful in better understanding how to improve services for patients.

Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Footnotes aThis can also be referred to as 'quality of the evidence' or 'confidence in the estimate.' The 'certainty of the evidence' is an assessment of how good an indication the research provides of the likely eect; i.e. the likelihood that the eect will be substantially dierent from what the research found. By 'substantially dierent' we mean a large enough dierence that it might aect a decision. bIndirectness includes consideration of: indirect or between-study comparisons; indirect or surrogate outcomes; applicability: study populations, interventions, or comparisons that are dierent than those of interest. cOther considerations for downgrading include publication bias. Other considerations for upgrading include a strong association with no plausible confounders, a dose response relationship, and if all plausible confounders or biases would decrease the size of the eect, if there is evidence of an eect, or increase it if there is evidence of no harmful eect (safety). dOverall score: 4 (high): This research provides a very good indication of the likely eect. The likelihood that the eect will be substantially dierent** is low. 3 (moderate): This research provides a good indication of the likely eect. The likelihood that the eect will be substantially dierent** is low to moderate. 2 (low): This research provides some indication of the likely eect. However, the likelihood that it will be substantially dierent** is high. 1 (very low): This research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely eect. The likelihood that the eect will be substantially dierent** is very high. ** Substantially dierent = a large enough dierence that it might aect a decision.

Because of this change, the current RRs are not comparable to our previously published ORs. However, when we compared the updated patient reminder or recall summary measure, using a random eects OR, with the previous findings the results were nearly identical. We updated the risk of bias criteria from previous standards to current standards; expanded descriptions in the Characteristics of included studies tables; added 'Risk of bias' tables for each included study; added GRADE assessments; added 'Certainty assessment of evidence for each outcome' methods and tables; added 'Summary of findings' tables for each intervention; added funnel plots to assess for reporting bias; conducted sensitivity analyses; and added text messages as a new intervention type. Since the last published version we have added three authors: Drs. Robert Jacobson, Tamera Coyne-Beasley, and Josephine Asafu-Adjei, respectively, two pediatric and adolescent physicians and one biostatistician.
