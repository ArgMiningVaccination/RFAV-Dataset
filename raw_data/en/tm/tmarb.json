Anthroposophy is a Spiritual Science. It firmly believes in the balance between matter and spirit. It also believes that a human being is made up of both physical and spiritual or subtler aspects which cannot be measured but which can definitely be experienced (Example: dreams, consciousness). Anthroposophy is in stark contrast to other common natural science philosophies and theories. Those theories rely heavily on the five senses to study and engage with the environment. Any belief in the manifestation of the spiritual realm is dismissed as pure coincidence. Anthroposophy believes in something inherently deeper, something spiritual present in the human soul, by which the world can be understood. Anthroposophy was founded by Rudolf Steiner who was an Austrian philosopher, social reformer, esotericist, and clairvoyant. Rudolf Steiner suggested psychotherapy may be most valuable when treating physical illnesses, while mental illnesses generally require medical treatment. Our understanding and conservative way of practices are to use medicines for physical ailments and in mental disorders (in cases of severe mental health issues, interfering with day-to-day functioning). But we need to look at the underlying emotional and psychological causes of a physical illness or disease. Only then can psychotherapy become a mode of healing. Medical treatment needs to be given importance while dealing with mental health issues. This revolutionary viewpoint makes us reconsider the complete system of medicine and healing. "}
