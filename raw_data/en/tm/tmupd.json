But there's one thing, or rather one very itchy child, that makes these toddler gatherings different from others. These parties, known as chickenpox parties, are organized by parents who want their children to catch [the virus]('http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=6403984) naturally rather than getting [vaccinated. ](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Germs/story?id=5703895&page=1) Carrie, a mother from Atlanta, Ga., who asked that her last name not be used for privacy reasons, is one of those parents. \"My 7-year-old daughter has been to six of these parties,\" said Carrie, who also runs an online forum that helps parents organize and find parties in their neighborhoods. \"Unfortunately, we have not caught the pox yet, but I'm keeping my eye out for more parties.\" Carrie described these parties as \"no different than a typical playdate.\" She said some parents might have the kids share a snack or a cup that could encourage the spreading of the highly contagious virus that has symptoms including a red rash, blisters, fever and headache.

Exceptions, including proof that the child has contracted the virus on his or her own, as well as parents who refrain from getting their children vaccinated because of religious reasons, vary from state to state. Carrie said that her beliefs regarding [vaccines and their possible link to autism](http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=5910264), as well the instances she has seen when children who, despite getting vaccinated, still end up with the virus, have all played roles in her decision to hold off on vaccinating her daughter.
