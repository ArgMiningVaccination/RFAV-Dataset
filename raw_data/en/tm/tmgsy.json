Some, such as iron, zinc and cobalt are nee ded by the body in trace amounts, but are toxic in higher amounts. Others, such as mercury, lead, arsenic and aluminum have no purpose in our bodies. Since they have entered our bodies throughout evolution, we have mechanisms for their elimination. However, many modern industries either utilize the se metals or they are released as a byproduct. For exa mple, China's increased burning of coal releases higher a mounts of mercury into the air. These particles then settl e in the Pacific ocean and accumulate in the muscle of fish such as salmon. As larger fish eat smaller fish, this me rcury accumulates and becomes more concentrated. In addition, this biologic form of mercury in musc le-- called methyl mercury--is far more toxic than pure mercury, the silver liquid that used to be in therm ometers. The effect of mercury in tooth fillings and vaccinations remains a huge political issue. Though it is slowly and quietly being removed from biological products, there has still not been a governmental acknowledgment of the damage it has caused; and is still present in certain vaccines and other products. While we can now detect heavy metals in a person, it is rare that we can determine when and where they w ere exposed, since we (usually) don't know the source o f our water, the history of our soil, and the materials i n our older homes. Symptoms of Heavy Metal Toxicity Heavy metals are toxic because they poison numerou s chemical processes in the body. The most vulnerable sites are nerves, hormones, and energy production. Becaus e of the magnitude and pervasiveness of their effects, h eavy metal toxicity can manifest as a host of conditions . They can be the primary cause of a condition, such as au tism, ADD, developmental delays, multiple sclerosis, chro nic fatigue, neuropathy and dementia; and they can precipitate or exacerbate a co-existing condition, such as allergy, insomnia, depression and cancer. Symptoms can vary from week-to-week due to other factors such as stress, hormonal changes, diet, exposure to other t oxins, ant other illnesses. Variability of Vulnerability One major source of confusion about heavy metal toxicity is that some people are affected more than others. This variability is due to a number of factors--suc h as genetics, other toxins, and quantity of exposure ov er time. For example, a person may not be toxic if only eati ng a can of tuna fish a week; but if a few old metal fil lings are replaced, it might overwhelm the body's detoxificat ion mechanisms, producing various symptoms. As discussed in prior articles on detoxification, while a single toxin or two might be adequately handled b y the body, the sum of all the toxins in the body, acting in concert, called \"the cocktail effect\", may be exces sive. When toxins are studied, they are studied one at a time, and therefore the effects of hundreds (most of us h ave at least 300 different modern toxins in our body) is v irtually immeasurable, and varies from person to person. Therefore, when large populations are studied, suc h as the effect of mercury amalgam (silver fillings i n the teeth) on health, the very toxic effects on a few p eople may be washed out by the relative health of the maj ority. Heavy Metal Testing Testing of heavy metals remains confusing and controversial. However, a standard is emerging in h olistic medicine. Blood testing remains the standard for the government and conventional medicine. Clearly, a bl ood test that finds heavy metals is meaningful. However , the nature of heavy metals, to bind to various tissues such as nerve and bone, will only allow the blood test to b e positive if there has been a recent or overwhelming exposure. Also, while there are lower limits in the blood that are deemed \"safe\", many experts feel that any levels in the blood are signs of toxicity. Indeed, the lev els deemed toxic continue to be lowered, even by governmental agencies such as the CDC. Hair testing , while convenient and relatively inexpensive, when looked at logically, is not very helpful. This is because a positive test can mean that the b ody is appropriately excreting small amounts of heavy meta ls (such as after eating seafood) through the hair, de fending against toxicity. A negative test does not rule out toxicity because the heavy metals tend to be sequestered in the body. The only value of the hair test, if positive, is to confirm heavy metal exposure; but it does not quant ify exposure, toxicity, or timing. Urine testing by itself has the same limitations as the blood and hair test. However, if done \"with provoc ation\", by using a chelating agent, a meaningful result can be obtained. \"Chelate\" means claw, and a chelating age nt grabs onto heavy metals in the body and then passes out through the kidneys into the urine. In the provocat ive test, the patient takes a small amount of chelating agent , and the urine is collected for a certain period of time . If the chelating agent finds heavy metals in the body, it will carry them into the urine. If the test is positive and over a certain level, this is the most reliable validation of heavy metal toxicity and can quantify the problem. If there are questions about the effect of the che lating agent itself, then the test can be performed twice, without and then with the chelating agent. If the test find s little without the agent, and then much more with the agen t, then clearly the chelating agent found a deep sourc e within the body. If the test finds significant leve ls without the chelating agent, this can mean that there is cu rrent exposure, or very high level of prior exposure. The difference between the two levels is called the \"bo dy burden\", the level that came from deep within the b ody. Performing the urine test both with and without provocation is the most meaningful and valid method . There are several technical and safety issues regarding this test that require the supervision of an experienced practitioner. Getting Rid of Heavy Metals The body has many natural ways to capture or chela te 4/8/11-6 hmt_af.doc \"Heavy Metal Toxicity\" M Cheikin MD Page 2 these metals and excrete them. Natural chelators in clude vitamin C, cilantro, chlorella, garlic, alfalfa and others. In addition, EPA/DHA (fish oils), anti-oxidants and ot her supplements help displace the heavy metals from the tissues. There are known cases of autism that began after vaccination (due to mercury preservatives) that hav e been were greatly improved with the addition of such supplements. Again, depending upon the totality of toxic load of the body, these gentle agents can be effect ive or not. Certain metals, such as cadmium, are difficult to chelate. Chelating agents are used by conventional medicine when there are positive blood tests, such as when c hildren eat lead paint chips or are exposed to dust from remodeling of an old home. In this case, intravenou s (\"IV\") chelation is performed until the blood level s come down to \"acceptable\" levels. However, using chelation when blood tests are negative, or for other medical conditions remains controversial (and will be discussed in future arti cles). There are essentially three ways to perform chelat ion: IV, oral and others methods. In IV chelation, the c helating agent is dripped into the bloodstream over an hour or so. The frequency and duration of treatments is determi ned by the treating physician. It is the quickest, most expensive, and most controversial of treatments. Al so, if the heavy metals are mobilized too quickly, they ca n re- deposit in the body rather than being excreted, cau sing increased toxicity. Also, getting to deep deposits , such as lead in bone, may require a slower steadier strateg y. In oral chelation, agents are taken by mouth. This technique takes longer, but is more gentle, and can be supported with other nutritional measures. A downsi de may exist if there are problems with absorption or constipation. Other techniques for chelation include clay foot b aths, sweating, energy techniques (acupuncture and NMT) a nd other detoxification measures. While even more controversial than traditional chelating agents, th ese methods have their place when there is sensitivity to chelating agents or other issues. Since all chelating agents bind all metals (with different \"affinities\") taking a multi-mineral supp lement is important during a chelation process. Most protoco ls give the body specific recovery periods between treatmen ts As with testing, the treatment of heavy metal toxi city should be done with the guidance of an experienced practitioner. Concurrent Conditions Heavy metals, by impairing the immune system, can enable chronic infection such as Yeast (Candida), L yme, Herpes and recurrent sinusitis. In turn, chronic in fection and related dysfunctions (such as leaky gut) can so overload natural detoxification systems that the bo dy can not eliminate heavy metals that it could otherwise handle. This circular situation should be explored before embarking on a course of action. Treatment of one condition can provoke the other. Coordinating and sequencing strategies is sometimes very challenging and requires a combination of science and art 5, 6 . Ongoing Toxicity The reason we all should take a multi-vitamin (eve n recommended by the conservative AMA) is because we can't get all we need from our foods. We are assumi ng that we all have low-level deficiencies. Applying the same logic to heavy metals and other toxins, it is reasonable to assume that they are ge tting into our body every day, through the air, food, water, a nd perhaps electromagnetic media. Even when completing a chelation/detox process, there remain toxins in the body and in the environment. Adding chelation/detox supp ort to our daily nutritional program is a reasonable pl an. Moving toward organic foods, verified clean water, air filters, and daily yoga practice (to clear our mind s, bodies and spirits) is a goal that we need to establish, n ot only for ourselves, but to increase the chances of our proge ny being healthy (through epi-genetics, see above). Because of the pervasiveness of heavy metals, and their continued use due to political issues, we mus t take a proactive stance. Compared with all the other thing s we can or should do to protect the health of ourselves , our families and our children, investing the time and e nergy to satisfy the heavy metal question is extremely cost effective.
