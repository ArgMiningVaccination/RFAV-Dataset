Bown\u0084, Christopher M. Snyder , Robert W. Staiger\u00a7 Preliminary June 1 2022 1 Introduction Accelerating the pace of vaccine development and manufacturing was crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic. In record time, multiple COVID-19 vaccines were invented, proceeded successfully through clinical trials, and began to be produced at commercial scale. Yet, an open question is whether elements of that sequential process, especially investment in production capacity, could have been started earlier so that more vaccine doses would have arrived sooner. Potentially millions of lives, as well as trillions of dollars of economic activity, could have been saved.1Why governments did not intervene more to accelerate and expand vaccine production capacity remains a puzzle. Heading into the pandemic, much of the pharmaceutical industry was char- acterized by a fragmented production process, relying on outsourcing to contract manufacturers, often also with o shoring to rms located abroad. A plant to manufacture the drug substance for a vaccine, for example, might be located in one country, while a second country would host a second and di erent type of facility to then formulate that vaccine and place it into vials for distribution. Furthermore, specialized inputs for the industry may only have been available through imports. A vaccine manufacturer in India or Germany might require variable inputs only supplied, at least in the very short run, by a rm at arm's length located in the United States or United Kingdom. This paper provides a theoretical framework to investigate a number of po- tential implications of these issues. It provides one justi cation for why most of the early vaccine supply chains to emerge during the COVID-19 pandemic *We thank Teresa Fort, Matthew Grant and seminar participants at Dartmouth for helpful feedback. \u0084Peterson Institute for International Economics; and CEPR.

Summers (2020) and Agarwal and Gopinath (2021). 1were national and concentrated in only a few countries, despite the possibil- ity for much greater geographic diversi cation of that fragmented production process. The framework also allows for an examination into whether an indus- trial structure characterized by o shoring and imported inputs, where it did arise, may have contributed to the failure of governments to align private and social incentives for early investment in vaccine manufacturing. Finally, we use the framework to investigate the possibility of potentially novel motivations for international economic policy cooperation - in the form of coordinated, expan- sionary subsidy policies along a supply chain - to ensure the resilience of that supply chain during a pandemic. We begin by developing a simple theoretical model of a vaccine producer in a closed economy, motivated by the insights of Athey et al. (2022).2We characterize a pandemic as imposing a per-period cost on society that can be mitigated with a vaccine. The model's rm is endowed with a promising vaccine technology and faces the decision over when to invest in costly production ca- pacity, capacity that takes time to install. We focus on the possible divergence between private and social incentives to undertake \\at-risk\" investment in ca- pacity for vaccine production, as emphasized by Snyder et al. (2020a,b), Ahuja et al. (2021), Castillo et al. (2021), Athey et al. (2022) and Bown (2022b). Following these authors, by at-risk investment we mean investment in vaccine production capacity during the period in which clinical trials for the vaccine are in progress, and hence before it is known whether the vaccine is safe and e ective and will be granted approval for use to inoculate the population against the virus. When the installation of capacity takes time, the bene t of at-risk investment { as opposed to the alternative of investment in capacity only once the vaccine has been approved for use { is the added speed with which it would allow a successful vaccine to be used to inoculate the population; the cost of at- risk investment is that this investment in capacity may turn out to be wasteful if the vaccine is not approved for use and the capacity cannot be repurposed. In our benchmark model, a single vaccine dose protects an individual against the virus for only a single period, and the pandemic is assumed to end exoge- nously at some xed future date, independent of vaccination status in the popu- lation; the implication is that the total demand for vaccine doses going forward declines through time as the end of the pandemic draws near, providing the rm with one possible reason for urgency when considering the timing of capacity investments. The question is whether the degree of urgency demonstrated by the rm matches that of the government/social planner. Our benchmark model yields an intuitively appealing answer to this question: since a pro t-maximizing rm does not consider the social costs of the pandemic in its decision-making, it invests too little in at-risk production capacity relative to the social optimum if and only if the price at which it expects to be able to sell the vaccine is below the vaccine's social value. In this light, we show that the rst-best policy to align private and social incentives for at-risk investment involves the government 2Athey et al (2022) provides the most complete summary of a series of research put forward over the course of the pandemic through the Accelerating Health Technologies (AHT) project. 2o ering the rm a price per vaccine dose equal to the social value of the dose. However, we also show that if e\u000ecient contracting directly over price is not an available policy option, then the government can replicate the rst-best policy with an optimal subsidy for at-risk capacity investment. In the appendix, we consider a number of alternative modeling frameworks to con rm the robustness of this baseline result. Estimates from Ahuja et al. (2021) put the social value for an individual course of COVID-19 vaccines at $5 ;800, whereas the prices paid by governments were between $4 and $60 through 2021. Evidently, real-world governments found that a commitment to pricing vaccine doses anywhere near their social value was not feasible, suggesting according to our baseline result that subsidies to at-risk capacity investment could be an important tool. We therefore assume that the price of a vaccine dose is set (for exogenous reasons) below its social value, allowing us to focus on the role of subsidies to at-risk investment in aligning social and commercial incentives.3 We then turn to the core contribution of our analysis by considering the role of o shoring and imported inputs. To do so, we begin by adapting our model to a setting in which the domestic vaccine manufacturer can also potentially source inputs via imports from a foreign supplier. We draw from the framework intro- duced by Antr\u0012 as and Staiger (2012) and model input trade as resulting in input prices which are determined by Nash bargaining between the domestic vaccine producer and its foreign input supplier after the foreign input supplier has sunk its capacity investments, on account of the lack of internationally enforceable complete contracts. We rst show that the presence of o shoring induces a unilateral policy choice by the domestic government that results in less at-risk capacity investment by the rm than would result under the government's uni- lateral policy choice if the input supplier were located in the domestic economy, due to a combination of the hold up problem faced by the foreign input supplier and the \\leakage\" of subsidy payments made by the domestic government to foreign entities. And all else equal, with less at-risk production capacity the expected health costs of the pandemic are then larger when the government makes unilateral policy choices and contracts with such an o shoring rm, rela- tive to when it contracts with a vertically integrated rm or one that outsources domestically. To consider the role of international cooperation over vaccine supply chain policy, we then introduce a second, symmetric country with a parallel market structure. We assume that each of the vaccine-producing rms can either source inputs locally or o shore inputs from the other country, and we focus on the at- risk capacity investment choices of input suppliers. We allow each government 3Of course in reality there also may be important frictions that our benchmark model misses and that would make a commitment to setting the price of a vaccine dose equal to its social value undesirable even if it were feasible, such as the frictions discussed in Athey et al., 2022, pp 6-8. In Appendix 9 we analyze one such friction that would arise with incomplete information in a linear-cost model, and there we allow governments to optimally choose the vaccine price in addition to the at-risk capacity subsidy. Our analysis con rms that while the details are altered, the main insights that derive from our benchmark model continue to apply in that setting. 3to set its own vaccine policy, either unilaterally or possibly under a negotiated international agreement, maintaining our focus on the case where the price of a vaccine dose falls below the social value of the dose so that subsidies to at-risk capacity investments are desirable. We show that our model's parameters can be partitioned into those under which the model exhibits o shoring of vaccine inputs as an equilibrium out- come when governments choose vaccine supply chain policies noncooperatively, and those under which the model exhibits local sourcing of inputs as an equi- librium outcome. And we show that the nature of the case for international cooperation over vaccine supply chain policy hinges critically on which of these noncooperative outcomes obtains. If the noncooperative outcome features o shoring of vaccine inputs, the at- risk capacity installed by each input supplier in the noncooperative equilibrium will be ine\u000eciently low, due to the international subsidy leakage that keeps unilateral subsidy choices for at-risk investment at ine\u000eciently low levels. In this case an international agreement that implements free trade in vaccine inputs and commits each government to increase its per-unit subsidy to the at-risk capacity installed by its own input-producing rm can achieve the e\u000ecient level of at-risk capacity installed by each input supplier, and provides mutual gains for each country. For this case it is the positive externality generated by subsidies to at-risk capacity investment when o ered to o shored input suppliers that drives the need for an international agreement covering vaccine supply chain policy. We argue that the absence of any such agreement, combined with the necessity of having to o shore certain inputs from abroad that was a binding constraint during the COVID-19 pandemic for a number of countries, may help to explain why some governments did not subsidize production capacity at risk with vaccine companies. If instead the noncooperative outcome features local sourcing of vaccine in- puts, then there may be no role for an international agreement on vaccine policy, but we show that it is also possible that a role for an international agreement on vaccine policy exists. Moreover, when there does exist such a role, we show that (i) the task of the agreement is to facilitate a switch to e\u000ecient o shoring of vaccine inputs, and (ii) while it is still the positive externality generated by sub- sidies to at-risk capacity investment when o ered to o shored input suppliers that drives the need for the agreement, in this case the international externali- ties are o -equilibrium and the observed subsidies to at-risk capacity investment may either rise or fall under the international agreement. Our results therefore suggest that a role for an enforceable international agreement on vaccine supply chain policies may arise, especially when the o - shoring of inputs is a potentially attractive way to reduce costs. And while we show that this role arises as a result of international externalities associated with vaccine supply chain policy, it is important to note that the international ex- ternalities featured in our setting are all pecuniary; non-pecuniary externalities, such as cross-border transmission of a disease, are ruled out in our model by construction. This suggests in turn that the World Trade Organization (WTO), rather than the World Health Organization (WHO), is the appropriate forum 4for the negotiation of such an agreement. At the same time, since our results indicate that increases in subsidies could be a prominent feature of such an agreement, the agreement might be best interpreted as a potential carve out from existing WTO rules, which are generally focused on disciplining national use of subsidies, not cooperatively increasing them to globally e\u000ecient levels.4 As far as we are aware, our paper is the rst in the economics literature to provide a formal analysis of government supply chain policies directed to at-risk investment, and to consider the role of international cooperation in the design of such polices. Grossman, Helpman and Liu (2021) is related, but their focus is on supply chain resilience more generally rather than attaining the optimal level of at-risk investment in pandemic situations, and they do not consider the possibility of international policy cooperation; and given their di erent focus, their modeling approach is of course quite di erent as well. In the operations research literature, Sun, Toyasaki and Sigala (2021) is closer to our paper in terms of focus, but their analytical approach is quite di erent and they do not consider international policy cooperation either. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides the institu- tional background, describing the key empirical patterns of COVID-19 vaccine supply chains and the policies that emerged during the pandemic. Section 3 introduces our benchmark model of vaccine manufacturing in a closed economy that is experiencing a pandemic and examines optimal government policies for at-risk investment. Section 4 allows for the possibility of o shoring and assesses its impact on the equilibrium policy choices and outcomes relative to the social optimum. Section 5 introduces a second symmetric country, examines noncoop- erative policies, and describes key characteristics of the international agreement to deliver globally optimal cooperative policy in the presence of o shoring. Sec- tion 6 concludes. An appendix includes a number of model extensions that explore the robustness of our ndings. 2 Institutional Background COVID-19 vaccines were completely new products. This section draws from Bown and Bollyky (2022), which tracks both the emergence of the supply chains (from scratch) needed to manufacture the new vaccines and the government poli- cies announced over 2020-21 that potentially impacted their formation as well as subsequent production. That research catalogs the vaccine supply chains to arise from P zer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca-Oxford, Johnson & John- son (Janssen), Novavax and CureVac. Through 2021, the only other COVID-19 vaccines with sizeable production were from China (Sinovac and Sinopharm) Russia (Sputnik V, from Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Mi- crobiology), and an additional one in India (Bharat Biotech).5In addition to 4That said, this feature of WTO subsidy rules poses something of a puzzle for the economic analysis of trade agreements. See, for example, Bagwell and Staiger (2001, 2002, 2006, 2012) and Sykes (2005). 5India's main COVID-19 vaccine output was the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine produced locally by the Serum Institute of India (SII). Even though Novavax and CureVac announced 5these vaccine candidates, governments provided support for a number of others over 2020-21, including some that were not authorized for distribution to the general public. 2.1 Vaccine supply chains This section brie y summarizes key features of the COVID-19 vaccine supply chains that emerged over 2020-21. First, there was geographic diversity at the national level regarding where these vaccines were invented. The Moderna and Novavax vaccines, for example, originated in the United States; the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was co-invented between scientists at its Janssen lab in the Netherlands and scientists at a hospital in Boston. The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine was invented in the UK, and vaccines from BioNTech and CureVac originated in Germany. Second, the vast majority of vaccine production would ultimately be con- ducted via subsequent outsourcing arrangements in which the vaccine sponsor contracted at arms length with third parties to handle manufacturing. In part, this was because the inventors of the vaccine technology were often either a biotech rm (BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, CureVac) or a university (Oxford), and thus without access to their own production facilities, at least at the onset of the pandemic. However, even Johnson & Johnson hired a number of \\con- tract development manufacturing organizations\" (CDMOs) for its production needs, as did AstraZeneca (despite having its own production facilities globally) when it was hired to coordinate the manufacturing and global distribution of the Oxford vaccine. The primary exception was P zer, which retro tted its own plants in the United States to manufacture the BioNTech vaccine. (The Euro- pean supply chain for the P zer-BioNTech vaccine involved a network of plants from P zer, plants that BioNTech purchased that eventually came online, as well as other CDMOs.) Third, the manufacturing process for each of these COVID-19 vaccines ex- hibited considerable fragmentation, with its core being two distinct plants. The vaccine drug substance was manufactured in one facility, and almost always a separate plant would receive that drug substance, add more ingredients to formulate it into the vaccine's drug product, and then \\ ll and nish\" it into tens of thousands of sterile glass vials, assembly-line style, for distribution.6For COVID-19, each of these plants had to be retro tted with specialized capital equipment, and their manufacturing processes would then also become subjected to strict regulatory oversight. Fourth, those drug substance and ll-and- nish plants for any given vaccine's supply chain were typically located in the same \\country\" (with the European full supply chains, Novavax had minimal global production through 2021 as it was slow in being authorized by regulators, and CureVac's initial COVID-19 vaccine candidate reported poor phase 3 trial results in June 2021 and was subsequently abandoned. 6The main exception was the complex mRNA vaccine of P zer-BioNTech in which there were multiple plants involved in an even more fragmented process of manufacturing the drug substance. 6Union counting as one country).7This arose even with considerable opportunity for further geographic diversi cation, especially given that the fragmentation of the manufacturing often resulted in two di erent CDMOs handling the two dif- ferent production steps, even for the same vaccine. Furthermore, to sell to di er- ent markets, most vaccine sponsors chose to set up parallel supply chains, with drug substance and ll-and- nish plants rarely in separate countries. With the exception of CureVac, each of the major vaccines set up parallel supply chains in at least the United States and European Union. (AstraZeneca and Novavax set up additional parallel supply chains in other regions of the world.) One im- plication of such a choice is that vaccine sponsors did not set up an alternative \\hub and spoke\" supply chain structure with, say, one plant manufacturing all of the drug substance for its vaccine at greater scale, the output of which could then be sent to multiple plants in di erent countries to be formulated, lled, and nished. Fifth, virtually all rms complained of input shortages. In addition to in- su\u000ecient availability of (the capital embodied in) entire ll-and- nish facilities, for example, rms also complained about access to variable inputs from their other, arms-length suppliers. Examples ranged from the lipid nanoparticles that were essential for the new mRNA vaccine technology platforms used by P zer- BioNTech and Moderna, to the bioreactor bags, lters and other \\consumable\" inputs used up in their part of the production process at the plants making vaccines for other rms. 2.2 Government policies impacting vaccine manufacturing Governments pursued a variety of contracting approaches with the vaccine com- panies beginning in 2020. However, relatively few wrote at-risk (push or pull) contracts to accelerate vaccine manufacturing, and fewer still subsidized any rms beyond the initial vaccine sponsor - i.e., there were few subsidies allocated directly to input providers elsewhere along the supply chain. The United States was the major exception. Through its Operation Warp Speed initiative begun shortly after the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, the federal government initially supported seven vaccine sponsors and provided the largest amount of total funding. It started by funding a number of clinical trials, including the lengthy, costly, and pivotal phase-3 trials. Then, in the summer and fall of 2020, it contracted with ve di erent vaccine sponsors to accelerate vaccine production in advance of (still ongoing) phase-3 trials and committed to purchase 100 million (or more) doses upon emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration. While the public versions of the contracts with these companies contain considerable redactions, according to the Government Accountability O\u000ece, the agency tasked under the CARES Act with oversight of Congressional funding for COVID-19, the contracts included at least some push (guaranteed funding for inputs, regardless if the vaccine 7One notable exception was Moderna's European supply chain where the drug substance facility was in Switzerland, whereas the ll-and- nish plants were in Spain and France. 7received regulatory approval) and pull (bonus payments for early delivery of doses) incentives to accelerate the production capacity capable of producing at least 100 million doses. On push funding, for example, the government agreed to pay Moderna \\in- crementally for meeting certain milestones without requiring Moderna to rst obtain an EUA\"; furthermore the government funding assisted the company \\with cash ow by providing interim payments.\" Each of the ve contracts also included the right for the government to terminate the agreement and only have to pay \\for work performed in accordance with the agreement terms\" (GAO 2021, p. 19). Given that the government had the right to terminate the contracts, the total amount of funding each rm would receive was unknown. Finally, on pull funding, the initial contract with Moderna had a rm- xed price of $12.50 per dose for the rst 100 million doses, but it also included a bonus payment of $3.00 per dose for meeting a regulatory authorization deadline of January 31, 2021. (The FDA authorized Moderna's vaccine for emergency use in the United States on December 18, 2020.) The US government had a completely di erent, procurement-only contract with P zer. The United States negotiated a $1.95 billion contract in July 2020 for 100 million doses of its vaccine, thus providing it a relatively higher price ( $19.50 per dose). However, the payment would only be made upon regulatory approval and delivery of doses. Thus, in this case, P zer retained the risk of failure.8 Finally, the United States also provided contracts directly to a number of input providers beginning in the summer of 2020 so that they could install additional capacity at risk. This included at least one contract with a ll- and- nish facility to be used as part of a COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing process, as well capacity-enhancing contracts to other rms providing variable inputs essential to vaccine production (e.g., bioreactors, bioreactor bags, cellular material) as well as vaccine dose delivery (e.g., vials, needles, syringes).9 No other government matched the scale or scope of the US at-risk contracts to vaccine sponsors or to input providers. In Europe, the United Kingdom was closest, committing a mostly nonrefundable $914 million in ve contracts with vaccine sponsors \\prior to any vaccine being approved by the regulator...to start manufacturing and to support clinical trials\" (UK NAO 2020, pp. 24-25). The UK government payments were also to be credited against future purchases of any vaccines authorized by regulators. Germany and the European Union (European Investment Bank) provided at-risk nancing to BioNTech and Cure- Vac to allow them to expand production capacity. CEPI provided some at-risk funding to the Serum Institute of India to manufacture the AstraZeneca vac- cine for allocation to COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access), the facility aiming to procure and distribute COVID-19 vaccines to low-income countries globally.10 8According to GAO (2021, p. 18) \\To minimize nancial risk to the government, the parties agreed that the government would pay P zer only after its vaccine received authorization\". 9See Bown (2022, Table 6 and Table 7). CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic 8Even in major vaccine manufacturing economies, some governments took a di erent approach. For example, aside from minor at-risk subsidies to help BioNTech and CureVac access additional manufacturing capacity, the European Union focused on negotiating procurement agreements collectively for the EU member states, at low prices, and also on ensuring that EU member states did not ght over supplies once they became available.11India, the country with the largest vaccine manufacturing company (Serum Institute of India) heading into the pandemic, did not o er subsidies to get its vaccine companies to expand capacity until April 2021, 8-10 months later than many of the contracts were agreed in the United States, for example. Not surprisingly, at a broad level the vaccines that received early regulatory approval (after good phase-3 trial results) with manufacturing facilities sup- ported by at-risk funding tended to be the \\success\" stories. Upon regulatory approval, they got more vaccine output from their plants than the manufactur- ing plants in other countries, or the manufacturing plants in the same countries where contracts were not provided at risk (Bown 2022b,d). Finally, and as ex- pected, some of the at-risk investments were lost because some vaccines did not make it out of phase-3 trials and thus were not authorized for use by regula- tors.12 3 Vaccine Production with Local Inputs We consider the problem of a government/benevolent social planner who seeks to minimize the overall expected cost to its country of a viral outbreak, and who deals with a single, domestic, pro t-maximizing (risk neutral) rm that is in possession of a promising vaccine technology. We assume in this section that, if clinical trials show that the vaccine technology is \\safe and e ective\" and the vaccine is approved for use, the rm can produce the vaccine with locally sourced inputs: the vaccine-producing rm either sources inputs com- pletely within its rm boundaries (i.e., it is a vertically integrated rm), or it can outsource domestically all needed inputs for vaccine production in an envi- ronment of perfect contract enforcement. Since these two possibilities for rm structure will lead to identical outcomes for the results we emphasize here, in the formal analysis of this section we will treat the vaccine-producing rm as vertically integrated. We abstract from the impacts that a government's policy toward vaccine production might have on the distribution of income across its citizens, and implicitly assume that the government has lump-sum instruments that it can use to redistribute to its citizens any undesired rents that its vaccine Preparedness Innovations, is a foundation that received donations from public, private, phil- anthropic, and civil society organizations to nance independent research projects to develop vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. 11This may have been motivated in part by EU member states imposing export controls on PPE trade with each other in March 2020 (Bown, 2022a). 12For US regulators and the vaccine candidates that received at-risk funding under Opera- tion Warp Speed, this included AstraZeneca, Novavax and Sano -GSK. 9policies create for its vaccine producers. This will allow us to make our main points with a minimum of formal complexity.13 We focus on the divergence between private and social incentives to under- take \\at-risk\" investment in capacity for vaccine production, as emphasized by Snyder et al. (2020a,b), Ahuja et al. (2021), Athey et al. (2022) and Bown (2022b). Following these authors, by at-risk investment we mean investment in vaccine production capacity during the period in which clinical trials for the vaccine are in progress, and hence before it is known whether the vaccine is safe and e ective and will be granted approval for use to inoculate the population against the virus. When the installation of capacity takes time, the bene t of at-risk investment { as opposed to the alternative of sequential investment in capacity only once the vaccine has been approved for use, which we refer to as \\not-at-risk\" investment { is the added speed with which at-risk investment would allow a successful vaccine to be used to inoculate the population; the cost of at-risk investment is that this investment in capacity may turn out to be wasteful if the vaccine is not approved for use and the capacity cannot be repurposed. In this section we seek conditions under which the (vertically integrated) rm has insu\u000ecient incentive to make at-risk investments relative to the social optimum, and therefore conditions under which a government program of subsi- dies to at-risk investment would be optimal. Our perspective is that of a closed economy. In the next section we allow the possibility of international trade, and consider how such a program of subsidies would be complicated if the vaccine- producing rm o shores its inputs from foreign sources. In this and the next section we assume that the government designs its vaccine policy unilaterally. We consider the possible role that an international agreement on vaccine policy could play in section 5. Throughout we abstract from the R&D phase of vaccine development and focus solely on the question of optimal at-risk investment. We undertake our analysis in several related but distinct models, featuring in this section and throughout the main body of the paper a single, simple modeling approach that we will refer to as the Benchmark Model, and relegating to the appendix our analysis under alternative modeling approaches. In all of our models the outbreak is assumed to exogenously end after a xed length of time. The end of the outbreak could re ect the emergence of a highly contagious but benign variant of the virus which dominates other variants, precluding serious harm from the disease after that point. Alternatively, the end of the outbreak could re ect the date after which a repurposed generic drug is discovered to eliminate harm from the virus at very low cost. We take the outbreak to be of moderate enough duration that it is reasonable to abstract from discounting, 13Many interesting and important issues of vaccine policy design arise as a result of the desire of policy makers to achieve public health goals with a minimum of rents transferred to supplying rms (see, for example, Snyder et al., 2020a,b). By abstracting from these issues in the main body of the paper we are able to simplify the analysis and better highlight our main points, which we view as complementary to this wider set of design issues. In Appendix 9 we consider the speci c possibility that incomplete information would limit the ability of the government to eliminate rents associated with its policy intervention at will. 10setting the discount rate for all players to 0. Critically, in each model that we consider the social value of installing an additional unit of vaccine production capacity declines through time. Thus, each model features a hallmark of viral outbreak situations: for purposes of public health and when it comes to the installation of vaccine production capacity during the outbreak, speed is of the essence. This feature sets the stage for an analysis of the commercial versus social incentives for at-risk (i.e., early) investments in capacity installation. But across the models that we consider, speed matters for di erent reasons. In the Benchmark Model that we feature throughout the main body of the paper, the social value of an additional vaccine dose is constant through time as long as the outbreak continues, because the health bene t provided by a single vaccine dose is non-durable. But the social value of installing an additional unit of vaccine production capacity nevertheless declines through time, because production capacity is durable and the number of doses that society can make use of { and that installed, durable production capacity can make possible { declines through time as the end of the outbreak draws near. In the model that we consider in Appendix 7, by contrast, the social value of installing an additional unit of vaccine production capacity declines through time, because the health bene t provided by a vaccine dose is now durable, and so while the number of doses that society can make use of before the outbreak ends is xed by the size of its population, it is now the social value of an addi- tional vaccine dose itself that declines through time, a re ection of the fact that the time-span that the dose serves to prevent illness becomes truncated as the end of the outbreak approaches. In Appendix 8 we present an extension of these two modeling approaches in which the social value of installing another unit of vaccine capacity declines through time for an additional reason, namely, because the susceptibility in the population is now assumed to be heterogeneous, and the rst vaccine doses are given to those who are most in danger of severe illness from the virus. And nally, in Appendix 9 we introduce the possibility that the government operates in a setting of incomplete information when designing its vaccine policy interventions. Our goal in presenting the analysis in these alter- native settings is to extract the general policy insights that apply across the disparate model environments. 3.1 Potential vaccine demand that declines through time We consider a country that is populated by a continuum of citizens with mass L. At timet= 1 a new virus begins circulating in the country. We assume that, absent an e ective vaccine, the virus circulates in the population for Tperiods and then disappears; hence period Tmarks the last period of the outbreak. We assume as well that in every period when the virus is circulating each unvacci- nated individual will be infected by the virus with probability \u000e2(0;1] and, if infected, will be sick for the period and then recover (infected individuals do not die, and hence the population is constant through time); we therefore abstract from the dynamics of contagion and assume that an unvaccinated individual's 11chances of infection are independent of how many others in the population are infected or vaccinated, and that an unvaccinated individual who has been infected in a previous period has the same chance of being infected again in a future period as long as the individual remains unvaccinated and the virus is still circulating. An individual who is infected by the virus becomes ill and imposes a one-period health cost on society which we denote by h>0. This cost re ects both the private cost (economic, physical, psychological) borne by the individ- ual and also the wider social costs associated with becoming ill (overcrowding in hospitals, disrupted supply chains). Finally, we abstract from discounting (by either the rm or society) over the Tperiods of the outbreak. With these assumptions, in the absence of a safe and e ective vaccine the expected cost imposed on the country by the virus amounts to LT\u000eh . We assume that clinical trials for the vaccine begin at time t= 1, the period that the new virus begins circulating in the population, and that these trials take a total of Mperiods to complete.14Hence, at the beginning of period M+1 it becomes known whether the vaccine is safe and e ective, and we assume that the vaccine will be deemed safe and e ective with probability s2(0;1]. If the clinical trials fail to show that the vaccine is safe and e ective, then the vaccine will not be approved for use and no sales of the vaccine can be made in any period. On the other hand, if the vaccine is found to be safe and e ective, then it is immediately approved for general use in the population beginning in periodM+ 1 and until the virus stops circulating at the end of period T. We assume that one dose of the vaccine is 100% e ective in preventing an individual from contracting the virus during the period that the dose is administered, and provides no protection thereafter. Hence, for a vaccine that is found to be safe and e ective at the beginning of period M+1, the number of vaccine doses that an individual requires to remain protected from the virus through to the end of the outbreak is T\u0000M; therefore to inoculate the entire population beginning in periodM+ 1 and until the virus stops circulating at the end of period Twould requireL(T\u0000M) doses. The upshot is that in period t=M+ 1 the potential total demand for safe and e ective vaccine doses through the end of the contagion period is equal toL(T\u0000M), but this potential demand declines with each passing period: in periodtfort2[M+ 1;T] it is given by L(T\u0000(t\u00001)). As we will see, for this reason the potential total demand faced by the vaccine-producing rm depends on the capacity investment choices that the rm makes { and in particular on whether at-risk capacity investment is undertaken and, if so, at what level. We model vaccine production as a two-step process. An input (say the vac- 14In the context of the COVID-19 vaccines, phase-3 clinical trials took roughly 5 months to complete. We assume that the trials themselves are su\u000eciently small relative to the population that they are costless to run (re ecting the reality that clinical-trial costs are eclipsed by capacity and production costs for vaccines supplied at pandemic scales; see the cost estimates in Snyder et al., 2020), and that they have no measurable impact on population-wide health outcomes. Also, we take the completion time for clinical trials to be exogenous, but this may also be an important margin for policy intervention (indeed, the US and UK provided some funding for clinical trials, as described in section 2), and possibly for international policy cooperation. 12cine's active ingredient) produced in an upstream facility is shipped to a down- stream facility that lls a vial with the input and other additives constituting a nished dose. As mentioned, in this section we assume that the two facilities are located domestically and (without loss of generality) integrated in the same rm. In any period t, input production cannot exceed the input supplier's in- stalled capacity. We assume that after it is installed, one unit of capacity can produce the input requirement for one vaccine dose each period thereafter, and that capacity is sunk and cannot be repurposed to manufacture other pharma- ceuticals or products. Besides the capacity cost, each unit of input involves a marginal production cost of \u0014, with\u0014<\u000eh so that the social bene t of another dose of the (safe and e ective) vaccine for use during the outbreak exceeds the marginal cost of producing it. We abstract from capacity and production costs involved in transforming the input into a nal vaccine dose, assuming that is done costlessly and is not capacity constrained.15 In principle, the rm can invest in any amount of input capacity vt\u00150 at the beginning of any period tin as many tranches as it wishes, and as we have noted, we assume that, once installed, this capacity is durable. But installation takes time. In particular we assume that capacity investments made at the beginning of period twill not be fully installed and ready for deployment in production until the beginning of period t+m. We further assume that the cost of investing in capacity at the level v, which is incurred in the period when the investment in that capacity is made, is given by the increasing and convex cost function c(v), withc(0) = 0 and c0(0) = 0. The convexity of the capacity cost function provides a technological reason for spreading the investments in capacity across periods, and in particular across the at-risk ( t2[1;M]) and not- at-risk (t2[M+1;T]) phases of the outbreak; and if speed means concentrating these investments into a short, early time span, then the convex cost assumption ensures that speed cannot be had for free. But the question still remains whether the pro t motives of the rm will lead to the socially optimal choices in this regard. Finally, for simplicity we assume that the shelf life of the input expires at the end of the period in which it is produced, and we thereby abstract from the possibility of using at-risk capacity to build a stockpile of the input for later use should the clinical trials be successful.16To avoid uninteresting taxonomies, we also assume that T >M +mand thatm<M .17 In order to focus on the at-risk capacity margin, we introduce the following assumption that will simplify the analysis of the government's preferred at-risk 15Of course in reality there are bound to be important at-risk capacity investment choices that have to be made for both inputs and nal production of vaccines, and a more realistic model would consider the problem of at-risk capacity at each stage along the production process and the complications for policy that this might introduce. We leave this extension to future work. 16Stockpiling vaccine doses at risk is a theoretically interesting possibility, but it does not appear to have been particularly relevant in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. In any case, allowing for this possibility is beyond the scope of the current paper. 17If alternatively we were to assume that m>M , then it is easy to show that investments in at-risk capacity would speed up the availability of vaccine doses by Mperiods (rather than mperiods) should the vaccine be deemed safe and e ective. 13investment level: max[c(L) (T\u0000(M+m))L;c0(L) s]<(\u000eh\u0000\u0014): (Assumption I) The restriction thatc(L) (T\u0000(M+m))L<(\u000eh\u0000\u0014) indicated by Assumption I is easy to interpret. This restriction ensures that even if the capacity necessary to inoculate the entire population ( L) had to be installed in the single period t=M+ 1, the social bene ts of installing this capacity (assuming the vaccine has been found to be safe and e ective) in terms of the inoculations it would make possible (( T\u0000(M+m))L\u0002(\u000eh\u0000\u0014)) would still exceed the cost ( c(L)). The restriction that c0(L)< s(\u000eh\u0000\u0014) implied by Assumption I is more subtle, but can be understood as follows. The term c0(L) can be interpreted as the maximum capacity cost savings (de ned positively) that could ever be had by delaying a small increment of capacity investment by one period and thereby achieving some investment smoothing. This maximum would occur if the initial level of capacity investment in some period were L, and if there were initially no capacity investments planned for the following period. From that (maximum-bunching) starting point, the removal of a small increment of capacity investment from the period where it was initially planned would save an amount equal to c0(L) in capacity costs for that period, while adding the small increment of capacity investment to the following period where there was initially zero investment would add the amount c0(0) = 0 in capacity costs. That this is the maximum capacity cost savings that could be had by such investment smoothing follows from the convexity of the capacity cost function c(\u0001). The term s(\u000eh\u0000\u0014) is the (minimum expected) social cost of the one- period delay in vaccine delivery that would be associated with this incremental reallocation of capacity investments across the two periods. Assumption I states that the social cost of the delay in vaccine delivery created by this reallocation exceeds the capacity-cost savings from the achieved investment smoothing, and so ensures that such a reallocation would never be socially desirable. Assumption I a ords two simpli cations to our characterization of the gov- ernment's preferred timing of capacity investments. First, for any level of at-risk investment below L, Assumption I implies that if at the beginning of period M+ 1 it is announced that the vaccine has passed the clinical trials and is deemed to be safe and e ective, then the government will choose to \\top o \" the at-risk investment with not-at-risk investment in period M+ 1 to bring operational capacity all the way up to the level Las quickly as possible (i.e., beginning in period M+ 1 +m), in order to be able to vaccinate every citizen in every remaining period t2[M+ 1 +m;T]. Denoting by Va\u0011PM =1v the stock of at-risk capacity accumulated by the end of period M, it follows from As- sumption I that the government's investment choices for the not-at-risk periods t2[M+ 1;T] will correspond to vM+1=L\u0000Vaandvt= 0 is then Vn=vM+1=L\u0000Va: (1) 14Figure 1: E ective Time Line And second, Assumption I implies that under the government's choices there will be no at-risk capacity investments made in periods t2[M+ 2\u0000m;M ], because relative to making these investments instead in at-risk periods t2[1;M+1\u0000m] such investments would be trading o investment smoothing for delayed health bene ts which we know under Assumption I is never desirable. Moreover, it is easy to see that it will be optimal to spread any at-risk investments made in periodst2[1;M+ 1\u0000m] evenly across those periods so that vt=vt0\u0011vafor ft;t0g2[1;M+ 1\u0000m]. Together these last two features imply that Va=M+1\u0000mX =1v = (M+ 1\u0000m)\u0002va: (2) We record the implications of Assumption I in Lemma I Under Assumption I, the socially optimal level of at-risk investment involves investing va\u00150in periodst2[1;M+ the stock of at-risk 1\u0000m)\u0002vaat the end of investment for t2[M+ 2\u0000m;M ]; the socially optimal level of not-at-risk investment involves the investment vM+1=L\u0000Vain periodM+ 1, and no investment for t2[M+ 2;T]. According to Lemma I, we can cast the government's optimal choice of capacity investment as its choice of the constant ow level of at-risk investment vathat will be maintained over the periods t2[1;M+1\u0000m], or equivalently as simply its choice of the stock of at-risk capacity Vaat the end of period M+ 1\u0000 m. Schematically, the e ective time line of the government's choices and their implications for delivery of vaccine doses is illustrated in Figure 1. We can now write down the objective of the government (who is taken to be a benevolent social planner). The government chooses vtfort2[1;T] to 15minimize the expected overall cost to its country of the viral outbreak. However, as noted, by Lemma I we can think of the government as simply choosing the stock of at-risk capacity Vathat it wants to accumulate by the end of period M+ 1\u0000m. To express the government's choice in this way, we rst de ne C(Va)\u0011(M+ 1\u0000m)\u0002c(va(Va)), whereva(Va)\u0011Va (M+1\u0000m). The variable C(Va) represents the capacity costs associated with Va, the stock of at-risk capacity accumulated by the end of period M+1\u0000m, where it is acknowledged that this stock of capacity is achieved through a ow of capacity investments at a constant level over the periods t2[1;M+ 1\u0000m]. The expected cost to the country of the viral outbreak may then be written as E[Cost right-hand side of (3) is easy to interpret. The rst two terms in the rst line are respectively the cost of investing in at-risk capacity at the level Va, before it is known whether the vaccine will be approved for use, and the expected cost of the additional capacity investment Vnin periodt=M+ 1 in the (probability s-) event that the vaccine is found to be safe and e ective, with Vn=L\u0000Vaensured under Assumption I as noted in Lemma I. The third term in the rst line re ects the expected marginal cost of producing the (safe and e ective) vaccine up to capacity given the at-risk capacity level Va. Together these terms give the expected economic cost of the vaccine program itself (recall that we are abstracting from the R&D phase of vaccine development). The expected bene ts of the vaccine program accrue from the possibility that the program will reduce the health costs that the country incurs as a result of the virus from what these costs would have been in the absence of the program, which as noted above would amount to LT\u000eh . These expected bene ts are re ected in the two terms in the second line of (3). If the vaccine is found not to be safe and e ective, which occurs with probability (1 \u0000s), then the vaccine program has no impact on the virus and the country will su er the health costs that arise when all individuals are unvaccinated over all Tperiods, namely, the cost LT\u000eh . On the other hand, if the vaccine is found to be safe and e ective, which occurs with probability s, then for the rst Mperiods prior to vaccine approval the country will still su er the health costs that arise when all individuals are unvaccinated, namely, the cost LM\u000eh , but the health costs of the virus during the remaining T\u0000Mperiods will be di erent: a portion (L\u0000Va) of the population will remain unvaccinated for another mperiods after the clinical trials are over while they wait for the additional capacity ( L\u0000Va) to be installed, and during this time the country will su er the additional health costs (L\u0000Va)m\u000eh; beyond this point, everyone is vaccinated in each period, and there is no further health cost as a result of the virus. Using (3), the rst-order condition that determines the socially optimal choice of at-risk capacity investment { that is, the at-risk capacity investment level ^Vathat minimizes the expected overall cost to the country of the viral 16outbreak { is given by @E[Cost (Va)] @Va=C0(^Va)\u0000s[c0(L\u0000^Va) +m(\u000eh\u0000\u0014)] = 0; (4) with the second-order condition guaranteed by the convexity of the cost-of- capacityc(v) function. According to (4), the socially optimal level of at-risk capacity investment ^Vais determined where the marginal cost of the last unit of at-risk investment, C0(^Va), is equal to the expected marginal bene t, where the marginal bene t of the last unit of at-risk capacity is non-zero only when the vaccine is shown to be safe and e ective (with probability s) and is then the sum of two terms, the cost savings c0(L\u0000^Va) associated with the smaller level of Vn needed to top o the shortfall between ^VaandL, and the net savings on health costsm(\u000eh\u0000\u0014) that the last unit of at-risk capacity generates by speeding up the delivery of a vaccine dose by mperiods (and hence facilitating the provision ofmadditional doses, each with a social value of \u000ehand a marginal production cost\u0014). Notice that according to (4) and with C0(0) = 0, ^Vaapproaches zero as sap- proaches zero, because as the possibility of vaccine success becomes vanishingly small, investing in at-risk capacity is purely wasteful. On the other hand, as s approaches one and vaccine success becomes virtually guaranteed, the bene ts of spreading vaccine capacity investments over time to minimize capacity costs (which follows from the convexity of c(v)) becomes important; indeed, in this case and as (4) con rms, but for the net savings in health costs m(\u000eh\u0000\u0014) asso- ciated with at-risk capacity, it would be optimal to spread capacity investments evenly across at-risk and not-at-risk periods, and the savings in health costs associated with at-risk capacity then pushes in the direction of greater at-risk capacity investments. These are the tradeo s that determine the socially op- timal level of at-risk capacity ^Va. Finally, for future reference we record the level of expected welfare achieved by the government under next consider the capacity investment choices of the vaccine-producing rm. To this end, we take as exogenous the price Pthat the rm receives for each dose of a vaccine that is deemed to be safe and e ective, and in analogy with Assumption I we assume max[c(L) (T\u0000(M+m))L;c0(L) s]<(P\u0000\u0014): (Assumption II) Assumption II has exactly the same interpretation as Assumption I, but with the expression on the right-hand side of the inequality in Assumption II now re ecting the operating pro ts rather than the social bene ts generated by one more vaccine dose. We record the implications of Assumption II in 17Lemma 2 Under Assumption II, the pro t-maximizing level of at-risk invest- ment involves the investment va\u00150in stock of at-risk 1\u0000m)\u0002vaat the end of investment for t2[M+ 2\u0000m;M ]; the pro t-maximizing level of not- at-risk investment involves the investment vM+1=L\u0000Vain periodM+1, and no investment for t2[M+ 2;T]. According to Lemma 2, under Assumption II we can cast the rm's optimal choice of capacity investment as its choice of the stock of at-risk capacity Vaat the end of period M+1\u0000m, just as we did for the government problem analyzed above, and focus on any di erences across the rm and the government in the choice ofVa, assured that the rm and government incentives for not-at-risk investment Vnare aligned. The rm's expected pro ts be written as E[\u0019(Va)] =s[Vam+ (T\u0000(M+m))L]\u0002(P\u0000\u0014) \u0000[C(Va) +sc(L\u0000Va)]:(6) The rst line of (6) gives the expected operating pro ts for the rm when it investsVain at-risk capacity. With probability (1 \u0000s) the vaccine will fail the clinical trials and the rm will earn zero revenue from vaccine sales. But with probability sthe vaccine will be found safe and e ective and will be approved for sale at the beginning of period M+1, and in that case the rm will earn vaccine sales operating pro ts in the amount of Vam\u0002(P\u0000\u0014) o of its at-risk capacity, and in period M+ 1 it will invest in the additional capacity Vn= (L\u0000Va) and then, once this additional capacity comes on line, earn vaccine sales operating pro ts in the amount of ( T\u0000(M+m))L\u0002(P\u0000\u0014). The second line of (6) gives the expected costs of the capacity investment levels VaandVn= (L\u0000Va). Using (6), the rst-order condition that determines the pro t-maximizing choice of at-risk capacity investment for the rm, ~V1, is given by @E[\u0019(Va)] @Va=sm(P\u0000\u0014)\u0000[C0(~Va)\u0000sc0(L\u0000~Va)] = 0; (7) with the second-order condition again guaranteed by the convexity of the cost-of- capacity function c(v). According to (7), the pro t-maximizing level of at-risk capacity investment ~Vais determined where the expected marginal operating pro ts generated from the vaccine sales made possible by the last unit of at- risk investment, sm(P\u0000\u0014), is equal to the expected marginal cost of the last unit of at-risk capacity investment, [ C0(~Va)\u0000sc0(L\u0000~Va)], which in addition toC0(~Va) includes as well the possibility (with probability s) of reduced cost in topping o capacity in period M+ 1 that the last unit of at-risk capacity a ords (\u0000c0(L\u0000~Va)). Finally, for purposes of comparison with (4), it is helpful to rewrite (7) in the equivalent form @E[\u0019(Va)] @Va=\u0000fC0(~Va)\u0000s[c0(L\u0000~Va) +m(P\u0000\u0014)]g= 0: (8) 18Armed with (4) and (8), we are now in a position to determine the conditions under which the at-risk capacity investment chosen by the rm will be lower than that chosen by the government/social planner. As a comparison of (4) and (8) con rms, if the price Pat which each vaccine dose can be sold is equal to \u000eh, the expected per-period health cost associated with an unvaccinated individual, then ~Va=^Vaand the choice of the rm will coincide with the choice of the government. On the other hand, if Pis less than \u000eh, then (4) and (8) imply ~Va<^Va. We may now state: Proposition 1 Absent additional policy intervention and relative to the social optimum, in the Benchmark Model at-risk capacity investment will be under- supplied by a vaccine-producing rm that locally sources inputs and can sell vaccines at a price Pper dose if and only if P <\u000eh . Proposition 1 points to a simple solution to the problem of under-investment in at-risk capacity: Why not maintain a price per dose of safe and e ective vaccines that is equal to the social value of that dose, \u000eh? That is, by setting ^P\u0011\u000eh; (9) the government would ensure that the rm's incentives for investing in at-risk capacity would align with the social incentive, delivering ~Va=^Va. An alterna- tive and equivalent intervention suggested by Proposition 1 when P <\u000es would be to o er a subsidy \u001bper unit of at-risk capacity investment de ned so as to insure that18 @E[\u0019(Va)] @Va=\u001b+sm(P\u0000\u0014)\u0000[C0(^Va)\u0000sc0(L\u0000^Va)] = 0: (10) As a comparison of (4) and (10) con rms, when P <\u000eh this implies a subsidy in the amount ^\u001b(P)\u0011sm\u0002(\u000eh\u0000P): (11) That is, by adding the term sm\u0002(\u000eh\u0000P) to the right-hand side of (8), such a subsidy to the investment in at-risk capacity would bring social and commercial incentives in line. It is interesting to compare these policy prescriptions to the discussion in Athey et al. (2022): Given the large expenditures involved in the recommended policy, mea- sures should be taken to ensure the expenditures are spent e\u000eciently, not wasted. Section 6 discusses some of these design features, including com- bining some of both \\push\" funding (contributing toward capacity costs) and \\pull\" funding (paying a bonus price for approved vaccines produced on an expedited schedule) and contracting on capacity rather than doses. (Athey et al., 2022 p 2) 18It can be con rmed that introducing such a subsidy cannot cause Assumption II to be violated and so we may continue to focus on the expression for E[\u0019(Va)] in (6) when calculating the rst-order condition that de nes ^Vain the presence of the subsidy. 19According to Athey et al., the natural policy options for addressing insu\u000ecient private incentives to invest in at-risk capacity are to either contribute toward capacity costs or pay a bonus price for approved vaccines produced on an expe- dited schedule (see also their discussion of commercial versus social incentives on pp 6-8, and their discussion of push versus pull funding on pp 14-15). In the model above, the former would correspond to o ering the subsidy ^ \u001bde ned in (11) to investment in at-risk capacity, while the latter would correspond to o ering a higher price for vaccines delivered in period M+ 1 than for vaccines delivered in period M+m+ 1. But Proposition 1 suggests that if the vaccine price is xed at the social value of a dose ^Pde ned in (9), neither of these policy alternatives would be needed. How might our analysis make more contact with the discussion in Athey et al. (2022) and the related literature? Recall that we have assumed that the outbreak will end in Tperiods, regardless of vaccine status, and that to prevent illness e ective vaccines must be renewed with additional doses every period. These two assumptions are important for the speci c result reported in Proposition 1, because as we have observed they imply that the social value of a vaccine dose is constant through time but the potential demand for vaccine doses declines with each passing period, and these assumptions therefore ensure that the faster the rm can deliver vaccines, the more doses it can sell. It is this feature of our model that, when combined with a xed price per vaccine dose set at the social value of a dose, aligns commercial with social incentives to invest in at-risk capacity as Proposition 1 reports. In Appendix 7 we develop an alternative model that re ects instead the fea- ture that the number of vaccine doses needed to end the contagion is xed, so that the number of vaccine doses the rm can sell is independent of its speed of vaccine delivery. As we establish and as might be expected, this alternative model does generate the need for a declining price of vaccine doses over time if the rm is going to deliver the socially optimal level of at-risk capacity in- vestment, much as Athey et al. (2022) indicate. However, it turns out that in this alternative model the social value of a vaccine dose is now declining over time, and as a result the more general insight from Proposition 1 { that the rm will make the socially optimal investments in at-risk capacity if it faces a price per vaccine dose that re ects the social value of the dose { is preserved in this alternative setting as well. In the appendix we also present variants of these two models in which the social value of investing in an additional unit of vaccine capacity declines through time because the susceptibility in the popula- tion is now assumed to be heterogeneous, and the rst vaccine doses are given to those who are most in danger of severe illness from the virus. We show that the insights from Proposition 1 apply equally well in those settings. Together, these results suggest that, if a government can commit to a price schedule for vaccine doses, then committing to set the price per dose at the social value of each dose would be a natural policy intervention for ensuring that socially optimal at-risk capacity investment is made by a vaccine-producing rm that locally sources its inputs. However, if commitment to such a price schedule is not feasible, then a subsidy to investment in at-risk capacity is an 20appropriate alternative that may be able to achieve the same result. We will therefore henceforth assume for our Benchmark Model that commitment to pricing doses at their social value is not feasible (or, for unmodeled reasons, not desirable) for the government, so that the implied policy from Proposition 1 is taken to be a subsidy to at-risk capacity investment. In the next section, we consider how such a policy would work (or would not work) if the vaccine producing rm is o shoring some of its inputs abroad. Of course in reality there also may be important frictions that our model has missed and that would make commitment to such a price schedule undesirable even if it were feasible, such as the frictions discussed in Athey et al., 2022, pp 6-8. In Appendix 9 we analyze one such friction that would arise with incomplete information in a linear-cost model, and there we allow governments to optimally choose the vaccine price in addition to the at-risk capacity subsidy. Our analysis con rms that while the details are altered, the main insights that derive from our Benchmark Model continue to apply in that setting. 4 Vaccine Production with O shored Inputs In this section we consider how the presence of o shored inputs complicates the optimal design of vaccine policy. We do so in the simplest way, by contin- uing with the Benchmark Model but now assuming that the domestic vaccine producer sources its inputs from a single foreign input supplier.19We focus on the at-risk capacity investment chosen by the foreign input supplier, who we assume faces a cost of capacity investment c\u0003(v\u0003) with the same properties asc(v), and who can produce inputs at a marginal cost of \u0014\u0003up to installed capacity. The domestic vaccine producer converts each unit of input acquired from the foreign input supplier into a vaccine dose, a conversion process which we continue to assume is done costlessly and is not capacity constrained. For now we also continue to assume that the government designs its vaccine policy unilaterally, postponing consideration of the possible role that an international agreement on vaccine policy could play until section 5. The capacity choice of the foreign input supplier v\u0003 tin each period tpro- ceeds in an identical way to that described for the domestic rm's choice of vtin section 3.1, except that in each period where there exists the capacity to produce inputs, the price and quantity of inputs exchanged between the foreign input supplier and the domestic vaccine producer are now determined by bilat- eral Nash bargaining similar to Antras and Staiger (2012), with capacity costs incurred up to that point in time taken as bygones and each party's outside op- tion being zero and with the bargaining power of the domestic vaccine producer denoted by 2[0;1]. And with the input price and quantity determined for the period, the input supplier then produces the contracted level of inputs at the marginal cost \u0014\u0003up to its installed capacity. 19Our analysis assumes that the foreign input supplier is not owned by the domestic vaccine producer, which as we describe in section 2 seems empirically to be the most relevant case. 21It is convenient in this section to begin with the analysis of the capacity investment choices of the foreign input supplier, and then turn to the choices of the domestic government. As in section 3.1, we continue to take as exogenous the pricePthat the domestic vaccine producing rm receives for each delivered dose of the vaccine that is deemed to be safe and e ective, and in analogy with Assumption II we now impose max[c\u0003(L) (T\u0000(M+m))L;c\u00030(L) s]<(1\u0000 )(P\u0000\u0014\u0003): (Assumption II') The di erence between Assumption II' and Assumption II is the presence of the term (1\u0000 ) on the right-hand side of Assumption II', re ecting the fact that in its Nash bargain with the domestic vaccine producer the foreign input supplier receives the bargaining share (1 \u0000 ) of the operating pro ts ( P\u0000\u0014\u0003) for each dose of the vaccine sold in the domestic country. Under Assumption II' we can cast the foreign input supplier's optimal choice of capacity investment as its choice of the stock of at-risk capacity V\u0003 aat the end of period M+1\u0000m, just as we did for the local-sourcing analysis of section 3.1. The foreign input supplier's expected pro ts can therefore the rst-order condition that determines the pro t-maximizing choice of at-risk capacity investment for the foreign input supplier, ~V\u0003 a, is given by @E[\u0019\u0003(V\u0003 = 0;(13) with the again guaranteed by the convexity of the cost- of-capacity function c\u0003(v\u0003). As a comparison of (13) with (7) con rms, if \u0014\u0003=\u0014 and if the foreign input supplier has all the bargaining power (i.e., if = 0), then its at-risk capacity choice ~V\u0003 ais identical to ~Va, the at-risk capacity choice of the vaccine-producing rm of section 3.1 that locally sources its inputs; but if the domestic vaccine producer has any bargaining power (i.e., if >0), then ~V\u0003 a<~Vare ecting the hold-up problem that the foreign input supplier faces. This marks one new dimension of the policy environment faced by the domes- tic government when it confronts an o shoring rm rather than the vaccine- producing rm analyzed in section 3.1 that was assumed to locally source its inputs. However, a more consequential di erence in the policy environments arises from the di erence in the government's own objectives across the two settings. Recall that in our analysis of section 3.1 we abstracted from the distributional impacts that government policy toward vaccine production might have, and implicitly assumed that the government has lump-sum instruments that it can use to redistribute to its citizens any undesired rents that its vaccine policies 22create for its domestic vaccine producers. This allowed us to adopt the view that the objective of the government/benevolent social planner is to minimize the overall expected cost to its country of a viral outbreak, without regard to the size of the rents transferred to vaccine producers. In the present setting where these rents will accrue to foreign input suppli- ers, this objective would still be reasonable for a global social planner who takes the interests of both domestic and foreign countries into consideration, and in the next section we will consider the role that an international agreement on vaccine supply chains might play in helping to implement the outcome preferred by a global social planner. But here we maintain our focus on what unilateral interventions a domestic government would pursue, and for the domestic gov- ernment any rents paid to foreign input suppliers cannot be recouped through lump-sum taxation. Hence, the objective of the domestic government/domestic social planner will be to minimize the overall expected cost to its country of a vi- ral outbreak, where any rents transferred to foreign input suppliers are counted as part of that cost. To write down the domestic government objective function, we rst use (13) to de ne ~\u001bas the subsidy per unit of foreign at-risk capacity investment that would induce the foreign input supplier to invest in at-risk capacity at in V\u0003 aand decreasing in P\u0000\u0014\u0003and also in- creasing in the severity of the hold-up problem as captured by the bargaining power parameter . We will adopt the convention that the domestic govern- ment uses a subsidy policy de ned by ~ \u001b(V\u0003 a;P\u0000\u0014\u0003; ) to achieve any desired level of at-risk capacity investment by the foreign input supplier V\u0003 agiven the (exogenously xed) price of vaccines in the domestic market, though it is clear that the government could in principle achieve the same ends by setting the vaccine price appropriately. Finally, we impose the analog of Assumption I for the setting where the vaccine input is sourced o shore, namely (1\u0000 )(P\u0000\u0014\u0003)\u0014(\u000eh\u0000\u0014\u0003): (Assumption I') Under Assumption I' and Assumption II', the foreign input-producing rm and domestic government incentives for not-at-risk investment Vnare aligned, be- cause if the clinical trials of the vaccine are declared a success at the begin- ning of period M+ 1 then under Assumption II' the rm will always top o its at-risk capacity investments to achieve capacity level Lin periodM+ 1, and the government will approve of this choice because the payment per dose that the domestic vaccine-producing rm makes to the foreign input supplier is 20As before, it can be con rmed that introducing such a subsidy cannot cause Assumption II' to be violated and so we may continue to focus on the expression for E[\u0019\u0003(V\u0003 a)] in (12) when calculating the rst-order condition that de nes the foreign input supplier's choice of Vain the presence of the subsidy. 23(1\u0000 )(P\u0000\u0014\u0003) +\u0014\u0003, which is less than the expected health bene t per dose \u000ehaccording to Assumption I'. Hence, as in the analysis of section 3.1, the only remaining question is whether the incentives of the foreign input supplier and the domestic government are also aligned with regard to the level of at-risk investment, or whether instead the domestic government will want to intervene with an investment subsidy to alter the foreign input supplier's choice of at-risk investment according to the subsidy function ~ \u001b(V\u0003 a;P\u0000\u0014\u0003; ).21 To explore this possibility, we proceed as before and cast the government's problem as simply its choice of the stock of at-risk capacity Vain periodMthat will minimize the expected overall cost to the country of the viral outbreak, where the government will orchestrate this choice with an appropriate subsidy to the foreign input supplier's at-risk capacity investment according to the function ~\u001b(V\u0003 a;P\u0000\u0014\u0003; ). The expected overall cost to the domestic country of the viral outbreak can be written as between the government's objective in the presence of foreign o shoring (contained in (15)) and in its absence (contained in (3)) appears in the terms that capture the economic cost to the domestic country of acquiring the inputs. In (3), where the inputs are domestically produced, the expected cost of capacity investment c(Va) +sc(L\u0000Va) captures the economic cost to the country of the vaccine program. In (15) by contrast, where the inputs are o shored, the economic cost to the country of the vaccine program now comes in two parts: the subsidy payments made by the domestic government to the foreign input supplier for at-risk capacity investment, ~ \u001b(V\u0003 a;P\u0000\u0014\u0003; )\u0002V\u0003 a, and the expected payments made by the domestic vaccine producer to the foreign input supplier for the inputs exchanged between the two, s(1\u0000 )[V\u0003 am+ (T\u0000 (M+m))L]\u0002(P\u0000\u0014\u0003) +s[V\u0003 am+ (T\u0000(M+m))L]\u0002\u0014\u0003. (15) and also using (14), the rst-order condition that de nes the domestic government's preferred level of at-risk capacity investment in the presence of foreign o shoring, which we denote by \u0016V\u0003 a, condition guaranteed by the convexity of the cost-of- capacity function c\u0003(v\u0003). The subsidy o ered by the government to the at-risk capacity investments of the o shore input supplier is then given by ~ \u001b(\u0016V\u0003 a;P\u0000 \u0014\u0003; ). 21With Assumption II' guaranteeing supplier will choose V\u0003 awith V\u0003 n=L\u0000V\u0003 a, and with the government's choice of capacity subsidy not altering this property (see note 20), Assumption I' does not require the additional condition that is included in Assumption I where, in e ect, with local sourcing of inputs the government is able to choose the levels of capacity investment directly. 24Notice that if the domestic government had the ability to tax as well as subsidize the at-risk capacity investment of the foreign input supplier { that is, if ~\u001bcould be negative { then it might be possible that the tax revenue collected from the foreign input supplier would dominate the choice of vaccine policy, and a negative ~ \u001bmight be chosen. We will restrict our attention to non- negative choices of ~ \u001b, re ecting the fact that while the domestic government could reasonably o er a subsidy to the at-risk capacity investments of foreign rms operating abroad, it would not have the authority to unilaterally tax these investments. Formally, we will assume that if the (unconstrained) rst-order condition (16) implies a negative value of ~ \u001b, then this simply means that the domestic government's choice of ~ \u001bis driven to a corner solution with ~ \u001b= 0. Comparing (16) with (4) and noting that the last term in (16) is strictly positive according to (14) and is absent from (4), it is clear that if \u0014\u0003=\u0014and when = 0 so that the foreign input supplier has all the bargaining power and hence faces no hold-up problem, \u0016V\u0003 ais smaller than ^Vaprovided that the vaccine price Pis xed at a level which lies strictly below the social value of a vaccine dose (i.e., provided that P < \u000eh ). The reason is that the domestic government has to concern itself with lost subsidy payments to foreign interests when it is attempting to use subsidies to achieve the right level of at-risk capacity investment for a domestic vaccine-producing rm that o shores its inputs. And when > 0 and the foreign input supplier is subject to hold up from the domestic vaccine producer, the vaccine price Pneed only be lower than\u000eh 1\u0000 to ensure that \u0016V\u0003 a<^Va, because hold up provides its own reason for under- investment. We summarize with: Proposition 2 When the domestic government designs its vaccine policy uni- laterally and faces a domestic vaccine-producing rm that o shores its inputs, the government's preferred level of at-risk capacity investment \u0016V\u0003 ais smaller than the level ^Vathat it prefers when facing a domestic vaccine-producing rm that locally sources its inputs from a supplier with the same marginal cost, pro- vided thatP <\u000eh 1\u0000 so that the vaccine price is xed at a level strictly below the social value of a vaccine dose adjusted for the degree of hold-up that the foreign input supplier experiences in its relationship with the domestic vaccine producer. The fact that \u0016V\u0003 a<^Vaalso means that, all else equal and when the gov- ernment designs its vaccine policy unilaterally, the expected health cost of the pandemic, which for any level of investment in at-risk capacity Vais given by E[H(Va)]\u0011(1\u0000s)LT\u000eh +s[LM\u000eh + (L\u0000Va)m\u000eh]; will be lower if the government can work with a vaccine-producing rm that locally sources its inputs than if the government must work with a domestic vaccine producer that o shores its inputs: that is, \u0016V\u0003 a<^Vaimplies E[H(Va=^Va)]<E[H(Va=\u0016V\u0003 a)]: 25This follows because when the government faces a domestic vaccine producer that o shores its inputs, it has to weigh the expected health bene ts of inducing additional at-risk capacity investment against the higher subsidy payments that are needed for this inducement and which are accruing to foreign rms. We record this in the following: Corollary All else equal and when the government designs its vaccine policy unilaterally, the expected health cost of the pandemic will be lower if a govern- ment can work with a vaccine-producing rm that locally sources its inputs than if the government must work with a domestic vaccine producer that o shores its inputs. Our discussion above has focused on the case where \u0014\u0003=\u0014and so has ig- nored the possible cost savings that might come from o shoring rather than locally sourcing vaccine inputs (i.e., the case where \u0014\u0003<\u0014). But at this point it should be clear that if the cost advantage achieved by the domestic vaccine- producing rm in o shoring its inputs is not too large, the domestic government can achieve a higher level of welfare by prohibiting imports of vaccine inputs and forcing its vaccine-producing rm to \\reshore\" and either domestically out- source the inputs or produce the inputs in house (vertically integrate), because this would allow the domestic government to then subsidize at-risk capacity in- vestment to achieve the level ^Vawithout losing the subsidy payments to foreign rms. However, as we detail in the next section, a policy to promote reshoring would be (at best) a second-best response. The real problem that the domes- tic government must confront when it faces a domestic vaccine-producing rm that o shores inputs is the positive international externality created by the government subsidy program, which can be addressed in a rst-best way by an international agreement to encourage subsidies to o shored inputs for vaccine production. 5 Vaccine Policy and International Cooperation Bown (2022c) observes that there may be a new role for the WTO in helping its member governments to cooperate on policies that can encourage vaccine supply chain resilience during a pandemic. In this section we consider the role for international cooperation over vaccine supply-chain policy that is suggested by our results of the previous sections. To this end, we add to the o shoring model of section 4 a second vaccine- producing rm, where this second vaccine-producing rm is located in the for- eign country. We assume that each of the vaccine-producing rms can either source inputs locally or o shore inputs from the other country, with Assumption I-Assumption II and Assumption I'-Assumption II' applying. And we allow each government to set its own vaccine policy, either unilaterally or possibly under a negotiated international agreement, maintaining our focus on the case where P <\u000eh 1\u0000 as emphasized in Proposition 2. To keep focused on the main points, we assume that vaccines themselves 26cannot be internationally traded, and that vaccine inputs can be freely traded. Moreover, to introduce a meaningful choice between o shoring and the local sourcing of inputs, we assume that the vaccine inputs produced in the foreign country may (or may not) be ideally suited for use in vaccine production in the domestic country, and that the vaccine inputs produced in the domestic country may (or may not) be ideally suited for use in vaccine production in the foreign country. We capture this by assuming that, for each of the vaccine-producing rms, the marginal cost of an input produced o shore is given by \u0014Offwhile the marginal cost of a locally sourced input is given by \u0014Loc. When\u0014Loc>\u0014Off, the marginal cost of vaccine inputs can be lowered by o shoring; when \u0014Loc\u0014\u0014Off, the marginal cost of vaccine inputs is lowest under local sourcing. The di erence [\u0014Loc\u0000\u0014Off] (which we allow to be positive or negative) therefore re ects the degree of cost-saving that can be achieved through the o shoring of vaccine inputs. Finally, we assume that if an input-producing rm were to produce inputs for both local sales and export, it would install separate capacity to produce the inputs destined for each market and would therefore face separate convex capacity costs for each market. This assumption ensures that the capacity decisions of each input-producing rm are separable across the two markets. We have in mind, for example, an environment where in each country, exports must be shipped from a port that is situated far way from the geographic center of local demand, and where internal transport costs in each country are high. The high internal transport costs would then create a reason for the input- producing rm to locate production capacity for exports at the port and to place production capacity for serving local demand at an interior location that coincides with the geographic center of local demand. As before, we abstract from any international health rami cations of a country's vaccine policies and assume that the health outcomes in each country are determined entirely by the country's own vaccine policy choices. Notice that with these assumptions the foreign country is now a mirror image of the domestic country, and that the mirror-image vaccine problem for each country is separable. With each country's input producer facing a separable capacity installation problem across its local and export market, the policy choices of the two governments are therefore strategically independent. This is not necessary for any of the results we emphasize below, but it allows us to make direct use of the results from sections 3 and 4 in deriving these results. 5.1 Noncooperative outcome Consider rst the situation faced by each government if there is no possibility of negotiating an agreement over vaccine supply chain policies. In keeping with our assumption that governments have lump-sum instruments that they can use to redistribute to their respective citizens any undesired rents that their vaccine policies create for their vaccine producers, in what follows we assume that each government can use these instruments to ensure that the organiza- tion of its rm's supply chain { vertical integration/domestic outsourcing versus 27o shoring { is chosen by its vaccine-producing rm in accordance with the gov- ernment's preferences. So in e ect, each government chooses (noncooperatively) whether its vaccine-producing rm will o shore inputs or rather source the in- puts domestically, and then selects (noncooperatively) the subsidy to at-risk capacity investment that it will o er. Given the strategic independence of the policy decisions made by each government and the symmetric features of the two countries, we can without loss of generality focus on the policy decision of the domestic government. If the government induces its vaccine-producing rm to o shore, then it faces the situation modeled in section 4 (with the marginal cost parameter \u0014Off now replacing \u0014\u0003), and as we have shown there it would o er to the foreign input supplier a subsidy to investment in at-risk capacity in the amount ~\u001b(\u0016V\u0003 a;P\u0000\u0014Off; ), inducing the at-risk capacity level \u0016V\u0003 aand achieving a welfare level implied by its own noncooperative policy choices notation E[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a)] to denote the expected overall cost to the country of the viral outbreak when the government induces o shoring and selects noncooperatively the subsidy that it o ers to at-risk capacity invest- ment. On the other hand, if the government induces its vaccine-producing rm to \\re-shore\" inputs and either produce them itself or outsource them domestically, then it faces the situation modeled in section 3 (with the marginal cost parame- ter\u0014Locnow replacing \u0014), and as we have shown there it would o er to the local input supplier a subsidy to investment in at-risk capacity in the amount ^ \u001b(P), inducing the at-risk capacity level ^V\u0003 aand achieving a welfare level implied by its own policy choices that when \u0014Loc=\u0014Off\u0011\u0014, Proposition 2 and its Corollary apply and so ^Va>\u0016V\u0003 a. And with ^Vadeclining in \u0014Locand \u0016V\u0003 adeclining in \u0014Off, it follows that for \u0014Loc\u0000\u0014Offpositive but below a threshold level Proposi- tion 2 and its Corollary continue to apply as well. On the other hand, if the marginal cost reductions associated with o shoring are su\u000eciently large in the sense that \u0014Loc>> \u0014Off(with both Assump- tion I-Assumption II and Assumption I'-Assumption II'), then the results of Proposition 2 and its Corollary will be reversed: the implied e\u000eciency loss from reshoring (\u0014Loc\u0000\u0014Off) would be so high that this alone would lead to a smaller level of at-risk capacity preferred by the government under reshoring, despite the avoidance of subsidy leakage that reshoring a ords. 28In any event, armed with (17) and (18), we can now partition the noncoop- erative outcome into two cases. If E[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a)]\u0000E[CostN Loc(^Va)]<0, then with noncooperative policy choices the expected overall cost to a country of the viral outbreak will be lower under o shoring than under local sourcing, and each government will induce its vaccine-producing rm to o shore inputs, and it will o er the subsidy ~ \u001b(\u0016V\u0003 a;P\u0000\u0014Off; ) to the at-risk capacity investment of o shore input producers in order to achieve for its vaccine producers the at-risk capacity level \u0016V\u0003 afor their o shored inputs. And if E[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a)]\u0000E[CostN Loc(^Va)]\u00150, then the opposite choice will be made, and in the noncooperative equilibrium each government will induce its vaccine-producing rm to reshore inputs, and it will o er the subsidy ^ \u001b(P) to the at-risk capacity investment of domestic input producers in order to achieve for its vaccine producers the at-risk capacity level ^Vafor their locally sourced inputs. To gain insight into the conditions under which either o shoring or reshoring occurs in the noncooperative equilibrium, it is useful to write E[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a)]\u0000 expected pro t earned by the domestic vaccine-producing rm under local sourcing, which is given by E[\u0019Loc(^Va)] =s[^Vam+ (T\u0000(M+m))L]\u0002(P\u0000\u0014Loc) \u0000[C(^Va)\u0000^\u001b(P)\u0002^Va+sc(L\u0000^Va)]; and whereE[\u0019Off(\u0016V\u0003 a)] is the expected pro t earned by the domestic vaccine- producing rm under o shoring, which is given by E[\u0019Off(\u0016V\u0003 a)] =s [\u0016V\u0003 am+ (T\u0000(M+m))L]\u0002(P\u0000\u0014Off); its share of the bargaining surplus with the foreign input supplier. Accord- ing to (19), for any level of the di erence in expected net-of-subsidy pro ts earned by the domestic rm under local sourcing relative to its pro ts un- der o shoring\u0010\u0010 E[\u0019Loc(^Va)]\u0000^\u001b(P)\u0002^Va\u0011 Loc(^Va)]\u00150, and therefore more likely that in the noncooperative equilibrium each government will induce its vaccine- producing rm to reshore inputs, the larger is the equilibrium subsidy leak- age under o shoring \u0016V\u0003 a\u0002~\u001b(\u0016V\u0003 a;P\u0000\u0014Off; ), and the larger is the discrep- ancy between the social and commercial value of any increased at-risk ca- pacity that comes with reshoring [ that ^Va>\u0016V\u0003 aprovided below a critical threshold. If ( \u0014Loc\u0000 \u0014Off) is above this threshold, the statement in the text still applies, with the phrase \\the smaller in magnitude is the discrepancy between the social and commercial value of any decreased at-risk capacity that comes with reshoring\" replacing the phrase \\the larger is the discrepancy between the social and commercial value of any increased at-risk capacity that comes with reshoring\" that appears in the text. 29\u0010\u0010 E[\u0019Loc(^Va)]\u0000^\u001b(P)\u0002^Va\u0011 its e ects on the expected pro ts of the domestic rm and all else equal, a larger [ \u0014Loc\u0000\u0014Off] (higher marginal cost under local sourcing as compared to o shoring) and/or a larger (higher domestic rm bargaining power under o shoring) tends to tilt government preferences toward o shoring. We summarize in: Proposition 3 In the noncooperative equilibrium and for any level of the dif- ference in expected net-of-subsidy pro ts earned by the domestic rm under local sourcing relative to its pro ts under o shoring, it is more likely that each gov- ernment will induce its vaccine-producing rm to reshore inputs: (i) the larger is the equilibrium subsidy leakage under o shoring; and (ii) the larger is the discrepancy between the social and commercial value of any increased at-risk ca- pacity that comes with reshoring. Moreover, through its e ects on the expected pro ts of the domestic rm and all else equal, a higher marginal cost under local sourcing as compared to o shoring and/or a higher domestic rm bargain- ing power under o shoring tends to tilt the noncooperative equilibrium toward o shoring. Proposition 3 partitions the noncooperative equilibrium outcomes into those that exhibit o shoring of vaccine inputs and those that exhibit local sourcing of inputs. In the next section we allow for the possibility of international co- operation over vaccine policy, and we establish that the nature of the case for international cooperation hinges critically on which of these noncooperative out- comes obtains. 5.2 Cooperation over vaccine supply chain policies In section 5.1 we considered the situation faced by each government when there is no possibility of negotiating an agreement over vaccine supply chain policies. We now ask whether governments could nd an international agreement that could o er joint bene ts to the governments over the noncooperative outcomes described in section 5.1. Again given the symmetry of the model, we can focus on the payo s of the domestic government. We organize our analysis in this section around the partition of noncooperative outcomes characterized in section 5.1. When the noncooperative equilibrium features o shoring Consider rst the case where E[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a)]\u0000E[CostN Loc(^Va)]<0, and therefore where the noncooperative outcome features o shoring of vaccine inputs and a subsidy 30to investment in at-risk capacity o ered by the government to its o shore in- put supplier in the amount ~ \u001b(\u0016V\u0003 a;P\u0000\u0014Off; ), inducing the at-risk capacity level \u0016V\u0003 aand achieving for the government the welfare level implied by its own noncooperative policy choices it was su\u000ecient to focus on the welfare level implied by a govern- ment's own noncooperative policy choices, given separability and the strategic independence of the policy choices of the two governments and the fact that we were simply interested in characterizing noncooperative policy choices. But to assess the possibility of government welfare gains from international coop- eration over vaccine policy, we now need an expression for the overall welfare that a government experiences in the noncooperative equilibrium, including the welfare implications of the other government's policy intervention. The overall welfare of the domestic government in the noncooperative equi- librium when o shoring prevails, as measured by the expected overall cost to the country of the viral outbreak at home and abroad, and which we denote by E[CostN the rst two lines are simply E[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a)], the welfare level im- plied by the domestic government's own noncooperative policy choices, while the terms in the third line represent the economic surplus captured by the domestic input producer. The expression after the second equality follows from observ- ing that \u0016V\u0003 a=\u0016Va. Notably, with the noncooperative subsidy payments made by both governments to their o shore input suppliers o setting each other, and with direct consequences of the division of bargaining surplus over the exchanged inputs cancelling out as well given that each country has a rm that plays each role in the bilateral bargain, this expression is identical to E[Cost (Va=\u0016Va)] for\u0014=\u0014Off, whereE[Cost (Va)] is de ned in (3) and gives the expression for the expected overall cost to a country of the viral outbreak in the local sourcing model of section 3.1. But it is now immediate that the two governments can gain from an interna- tional agreement over vaccine supply chain policies that implements free trade in inputs and has each government agree to o er to its own input-producing rm 31a subsidy to at-risk capacity investment at the level ~ \u001b(^Va;P\u0000\u0014Off; ), thereby achieving for the input producer in each country the level of at-risk capacity ^Va. This follows because, as established in section 3.1, the level of at-risk capacity ^VaminimizesE[Cost (Va)] by (4), and by Proposition 2 (and with marginal costs held xed at \u0014=\u0014Off)^Vais strictly greater than \u0016V\u0003 a, (\u0016Va)] =E[CostN Off;Off (\u0016V\u0003 a;\u0016Va)]; with symmetric arguments holding for the foreign country. Intuitively, the subsidy ~ \u001b(^Va;P\u0000\u0014Off; ) induces the level of at-risk capacity ^Vade ned by (4) in section 3.1 that a government would choose for its locally sourcing vaccine-producing rm { where there is no hold-up problem and where the government has no concern over subsidy leakage { and with the marginal cost of producing vaccine inputs \u0014set equal to \u0014Off. The subsidy ~ \u001b(^Va;P\u0000\u0014Off; ) is designed to solve the hold-up problem that arises for > 0 (as in Antras and Staiger, 2012), and given free trade the vaccine-producing rms in each country will be able to achieve the full e\u000eciency gains from o shoring and face marginal costs \u0014Offof vaccine input production. And nally, given the symmetry between countries there will in fact be no net subsidy leakage under this arrangement, since each government is o ering the same subsidy payments to at-risk capacity investments for inputs used by the other country's vaccine producers.23 With this agreement the two governments would therefore have found a way to enjoy the full e\u000eciency bene ts from o shoring while neutralizing the subsidy leakage problem that in the absence of an agreement would have led them to choose ine\u000eciently low subsidies to at-risk capacity in the presence of o shoring. We summarize with Proposition 4 If the noncooperative outcome features o shoring of vaccine in- puts and provided that P <\u000eh 1\u0000 , the at-risk capacity chosen by each input supplier in the noncooperative equilibrium, \u0016V\u0003 a, will be ine\u000eciently low. An in- ternational agreement that implements free trade in vaccine inputs and commits each government to o er a per-unit subsidy in the amount of ~\u001b(^Va;P\u0000\u0014Off; ) to the at-risk capacity investments of its own input-producing rm can achieve the e\u000ecient level of at-risk capacity for each input supplier, ^Va, and provides mutual gains for each country. We have characterized the international agreement on vaccine supply chain policy described in Proposition 4 as an agreement under which each govern- ment commits to o ering the subsidy ~ \u001b(^Va;P\u0000\u0014Off; ) to the at-risk capacity investment of its local input-supplying rm, even though under the free-trade policies dictated by the agreement each country's local input-supplying rm produces inputs only for export. This particular design of the e\u000ecient sub- sidy commitments seems the most natural in the context of an international 23Symmetry is not required for this result, as long as the international agreement allows countries to exchange transfers, but symmetry obviates the need for international transfers in our interpretation of the agreement described above. 32agreement because under this design each government provides direct subsidy payments only to local rms. But we could have alternatively and equivalently characterized the agreement as involving a commitment by each government to subsidize the at-risk capacity of its vaccine producer's o shore input supplier at the level ~ \u001b(^Va;P\u0000\u0014Off; ), more closely mirroring the geographical pat- tern of subsidy payments that would be suggested by the results of section 4 if governments were committed to free trade in vaccine inputs but did not have an agreement on subsidies to investment in at-risk capacity and therefore chose these subsidies unilaterally. With this equivalence clari ed, a second point is now also apparent: the subsidy commitment described by Proposition 4 represents a commitment to a higher subsidy than each government would choose unilaterally. This follows from the fact that the subsidy function ~ \u001bis increasing in the level of at-risk capacity to be induced by the subsidy, and that the unilateral subsidy choice would induce \u0016V\u0003 awhich is smaller than ^Vaas con rmed in section 4. The implied subsidy ~\u001b(^Va;P\u0000\u0014Off; ) called for in the agreement is therefore larger than ~\u001b(\u0016Va;P\u0000\u0014Off; ), the noncooperative subsidy when the noncooperative out- come features o shoring of vaccine inputs. Intuitively, the underlying feature that creates the ine\u000eciency of unilateral at-risk capacity subsidies is the positive international externality created by each government's subsidy program and as- sociated with the subsidy leakage that occurs when it is e\u000ecient for vaccine producers to o shore their inputs and when those input suppliers must make important at-risk capacity decisions. An international agreement can internalize these positive externalities, and thereby raise to the rst-best level the subsi- dies that governments o er to at-risk capacity investment for the production of o shored vaccine inputs. We summarize this point with the following Corollary When the noncooperative outcome features o shoring of vaccine in- puts and provided that P <\u000eh 1\u0000 , it is the positive externality generated by sub- sidies to at-risk capacity investment when o ered to o shored input suppliers that drives the need for the agreement characterized in Proposition 4. When the noncooperative equilibrium features local sourcing Con- sider next the case where E[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a)]\u0000E[CostN Loc(^Va)]\u00150, and therefore where the noncooperative outcome features local sourcing of vaccine inputs and a subsidy to investment in at-risk capacity o ered by the government to the lo- cal input supplier in the amount ^ \u001b(P), inducing the at-risk capacity level ^Vaand achieving for the government the welfare level implied by its own noncooperative policy choices In contrast to the case of o shoring, the magnitude of E[CostN Loc(^Va)]does re ect the full measure of welfare for the domestic government when the nonco- 33operative outcome features local sourcing, since in this case there is no interna- tional trade related to vaccine supply chains in either direction. And conditional on local sourcing, the level of at-risk capacity achieved under noncooperative policies ^Vais in fact e\u000ecient, because it is the minimizer of E[CostN Loc(Va)] as con rmed by (4). Hence, to determine whether there is a role for an international agreement on vaccine supply chains in this case, the only remaining question is whether local sourcing is in fact the e\u000ecient arrangement of the supply chain when E[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a)]\u0000E[CostN Loc(^Va)]\u00150: if it is, then there is no role for an inter- national agreement, because conditional on local sourcing the unilateral choices that each government makes related to vaccine policy will be e\u000ecient; but if local sourcing is not the e\u000ecient arrangement, then an international agreement that facilitates a switch to e\u000ecient o shoring can provide mutual gains to the two governments. Denoting by E[CostC Off;Off (^Va;^Va)] the overall welfare of the domestic government in the cooperative equilibrium under o shoring, as measured by the expected overall cost to the country of the viral outbreak at home and abroad and de ned as E[CostC Off;Off (^Va;^Va)] =C(^Va)+sc(L\u0000^Va)+s[^Vam+(T\u0000(M+m))L]\u0002\u0014Off therefore state: Lemma 3 A role for an international agreement on vaccine supply chains will arise when E[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a)]\u0000E[CostN Loc(^Va)]\u00150if and only if it is also true that E[CostC Off;Off (^Va;^Va)]\u0000E[CostN Loc(^Va)]<0: (Condition I) According to Condition I, if each country's o shore input suppliers were to invest in the e\u000ecient level of at-risk capacity ^Va, then each country would expe- rience a lower expected overall cost over the period of contagion than it would under local sourcing with the at-risk investment level ^Va. Lemma 3 therefore simply points out that even if governments would choose local sourcing of vac- cine inputs over o shoring when they expect noncooperative vaccine policies, it is still possible that under cooperative vaccine policies they would prefer o - shoring. An interesting feature of the case for an international agreement on vaccine policies identi ed in Lemma 3 arises when = 0 and there is no holdup problem associated with o shoring. Using (4) and (14), both evaluated at \u0014Off, it follows that ~\u001b(^Va;P\u0000\u0014Off; ) =sm\u0002(\u000eh\u0000\u0014Off\u0000(1\u0000 )(P\u0000\u0014Off)), so when = 0 we have ~ \u001b(^Va;P\u0000\u0014Off; = 0) =sm\u0002(\u000eh\u0000P) = ^\u001b(P). That is, in this case the level of the subsidy to at-risk capacity o ered to o shore input suppliers under the international agreement (~ \u001b(^Va;P\u0000\u0014Off; = 0)) remains unchanged from the level of the subsidy to at-risk capacity o ered to locally sourced input suppliers in the noncooperative equilibrium (^ \u001b(P)). Nevertheless, while the international agreement does not alter the observed subsidy level to 34at-risk capacity in this case, it is still the positive externality generated by such subsidies when o ered to o shored input suppliers that drives the need for an international agreement to internalize these externalities: it is just that in the case identi ed in Lemma 3, these international externalities are o -equilibrium. Finally, to con rm that there are model parameters under which the con- ditions of Lemma 3 hold, we x \u0014Locand consider di erent values of \u0014Off, and we de ne !\u0011[\u0014Loc\u0000\u0014Off] as the marginal cost savings that is asso- ciated with o shoring (for ! > 0) or local sourcing (for ! < 0) of inputs. It is easy to see that for !negative and su\u000eciently large in magnitude, (i) E[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a(!))]\u0000E[CostN Loc(^Va)]>0 is assured so that the noncooperative equilibrium features local sourcing, but (ii) Condition I will be violated so that no mutually bene cial international agreement on vaccine supply chains is pos- sible. To see that it is also possible to nd a range of !for which Condition I will be satis ed, note that for != 0 and xing all other model parameters, we must haveE[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a(!= 0))]\u0000E[CostN Loc(^Va)]>0 while E[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a(!= \u0016!))]\u0000E[CostN Loc(^Va)]<0, so that, conditional on these other model parameters, there exists ~ !2(0;\u0016!) such thatE[CostN Off(\u0016V\u0003 a(!= ~!))]\u0000E[CostN Loc(^Va)] = 0:But for ~!(and a left neighborhood of ~ !) Condition I is surely satis ed, last inequality is an implication of Proposition 4. We may therefore state: Proposition 5 If the noncooperative outcome features local sourcing of vaccine inputs and provided that P <\u000eh 1\u0000 , then there may be no role for an international agreement on vaccine policy, but it is also possible that a role for an international agreement on vaccine policy exists. Moreover, when there does exist such a role, (i) the task of the agreement is to facilitate a switch to e\u000ecient o shoring of vaccine inputs, and (ii) while it is still the positive externality generated by subsidies to at-risk capacity investment when o ered to o shored input suppliers that drives the need for the agreement, in this case the international externalities are o -equilibrium and the observed subsidies to at-risk capacity investment need not rise under the international agreement. 6 Conclusion Potentially millions of lives and trillions of dollars of economic activity could have been saved with accelerated production of COVID-19 vaccines. Why gov- ernments did not intervene with the sorts of policies needed to align private and social incentives for at risk investment in vaccine manufacturing during the pandemic remains a puzzle. 35This paper presents a theoretical framework to help investigate that puzzle. It begins by providing a closed economy model to illustrate a rst-best role for government policy to induce the socially optimal level of at-risk vaccine pro- duction capacity. Motivated by the industry's production structure - which is characterized by considerable outsourcing and o shoring - it then investigates the role of trade. In the presence of production o shoring or imported inputs, a benevolent government may induce its rms to under-invest in at-risk capac- ity, leading to larger pandemic-related health costs for its economy than if its vaccine manufacturer had set up a purely domestic supply chain. Nevertheless, even in the presence of production o shoring, governments can induce the so- cially optimal level of capacity investment, but doing so requires international cooperation. The form of policy cooperation involves commitments to greater at-risk-capacity-enhancing subsidies for input-providers along the supply chain. And the role for international cooperation may extend as well to situations where absent that cooperation vaccine-producing rms would eschew o shoring and source their inputs locally, pointing to the possibility that o -equilibrium inter- national externalities associated with subsidies can also underpin the need for international cooperation. Since the international externalities in our setup are all pecuniary by construction, the WTO is the natural institution to facilitate this novel form of international policy cooperation. We are not the rst to suggest a possible role for international cooperation on vaccine supply chains. For example, in a September 21 2021 Opinion Piece for the New York Times , Jeneen Interlandi, a member of the editorial board, put the point this way: Pharmaceutical companies generally know how to coordinate their global supply chains. They also know how to work together to secure the resources they need to make their products. But when the situation requires changes to national and global policy, world leaders need to step in. So far, they have not. For all its successes, the race to vaccinate the world against Covid has unfolded like a symphony without a conductor. The corralling of manufacturing sites has been haphazard. The channeling of equipment and ingredients has been messy and at times wasteful. And the ow of vaccines has been recklessly uneven: More than 80 percent of the four billion vaccine doses that had been distributed as of early August went to high- and upper-middle-income countries. . . . Boosters for the wealthy and scraps for everyone else will neither get us out of this pandemic nor prepare us for the next one. But nearly a year since the rst shots were administered, world leaders have yet to put forth a bolder or more comprehensive plan. \\Nobody is saying unequivocally, `Here is what we need, and here is how we are going to get it,\"' said Zain Rizvi, a health law expert at the consumer advocacy nonpro t Public Citizen. \\We were promised a war e ort, and instead we got a pillow ght.\" (Interlandi, 2021) Our ndings provide some guidance for this general call to action, by suggesting 36that a focus speci cally on international e orts to cooperate over subsidies to at-risk capacity investments could be especially fruitful. Given the public health and economic costs of the pandemic, our ndings also raise a number of questions for future research. The rst and most important is clearly empirical. While our model is consistent with a number of stylized facts on vaccine supply chains and the policy environment to emerge from COVID-19, the question remains: How important are the channels identi ed here relative to other economic, political, and public health factors impacting at-risk investment and vaccine production decisions? Second, while the results here suggest a novel form of international policy cooperation - coordinated, expansionary subsidy policies along a supply chain - are there other WTO principles that might inform policy makers on how to negotiate such an agreement in practice? Third, given the prisoner's dilemma nature of the problem, how might the agreement be enforced to prevent unilateral defections and increase the chance of compliance in its time of need during the next public health emergency?24We leave answers to these and other related questions to future research. 24The di\u000eculty of enforcing international commitments during a pandemic is emphasized, for example, in Staiger (forthcoming, chapter Discussion Note 2021/04, May.

In Appendices 7 and 8, we focus on the case of local sourcing and show that Proposition 1 extends to a setting where demand for vaccine doses is not time-sensitive and where susceptibility to the virus is heterogeneous in the population. In Appendix 9 we con rm that all of the results of the Benchmark Model extend to a setting with a linear cost-of-capacity function, and there we also extend the analysis to the presence of incomplete information. 7 Potential Vaccine Demand Not Time-Sensitive In the Benchmark Model developed in the main body of the paper, we assume that absent an e ective vaccine the virus circulates in the population for T periods and then disappears. As we observed there, this assumption might be rationalized on the grounds that a highly contagious but benign variant of the virus emerges at the end of period Tand becomes dominant, inoculating the entire population in period T+ 1 without causing serious illness. Together with our assumption that one vaccine dose can protect one individual for one period against the virus, this meant that the faster the rm could deliver vaccine doses to the population, the more vaccine doses it could sell. We now consider an alternative to these assumptions, which lies at the other extreme. We assume that one dose of the vaccine is su\u000ecient to permanently inoculate an individual, and that the benign variant arrival date period Tis su\u000eciently far out in the future that in e ect, as long as the vaccine turns out to be safe and e ective, the contagion ends only when everyone in the population has been vaccinated.25This implies that the rm will be able to sell Ldoses of the vaccine, regardless of the speed with which it delivers doses to the population. Reality probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes but, as we now demonstrate, there is a sense in which the design of optimal vaccine policy does not hinge on which extreme is closer to the truth. In particular, we show that the insights from Proposition 1 apply equally well in this setting. Relative to the Benchmark Model, this change in assumptions alters the optimal at-risk capacity choice both for the government and for the rm. For the government, this is so because a single dose of the vaccine is su\u000ecient to permanently inoculate an individual, and so a vaccine dose has greater social value in terms of preventing multiple periods of illness when it is administered earlier in the contagion period: in other words, the social value of a vaccine dose now declines through time as the world approaches period T. In particular, the social value of a vaccine dose administered in period t\u0014T, in terms of the health costs avoided as a result of the administration of this dose net of the 25The role of the benign variant arrival date is then simply to ensure that the cost to society of the virus remains nite even if the vaccine turns out not to be safe and e ective. 41marginal cost of producing the dose, is equal to [1 + ( T\u0000t)]\u0002\u000eh\u0000\u0014. For the rm, the optimal at-risk capacity choice is altered because at-risk capacity will no longer provide the rm with any advantage in terms of greater overall vaccine dose sales; what investment in at-risk capacity could do instead is provide the rm with greater revenues due to early sales of vaccine doses at higher prices, but only if the price per vaccine dose declines through time. Notice that the social value of a dose delivered in period t=M+ 1 +m, the period that capacity investments made in t=M+ 1 could rst be deployed in production, is equal to [1 + (T\u0000t)]\u0002\u000eh\u0000\u0014= (T\u0000(M+m))\u0002\u000eh\u0000\u0014fort=M+ 1 +m: This means that the analog of Assumption I that we imposed in the Benchmark Model can be stated for the present model as max[c(L) +L\u0014 (T\u0000(M+m))L;c0(L) s]<\u000eh: (Assumption AI) Assumption AI delivers the same properties in the model we develop here as does Assumption I in the Benchmark Model: namely, we can cast the government's optimal choice of capacity investment as its choice of the constant ow level of at-risk investment vathat will be maintained over the periods t2[1;M+1\u0000m], or equivalently as simply its choice of the stock of at-risk capacity Vaat the end of periodM+ 1\u0000m. Similarly, the analog of Assumption II that we imposed in the Benchmark Model can be stated for the present model as c(L) +L\u0014 (T\u0000(M+m))L<P(t=M+ 1 +m);andc0(L) s<\u0000[P0(t)] fort2[1;T]: (Assumption AII) Assumption AII delivers the same properties in the model we develop here as does Assumption II in the Benchmark Model: namely, we can cast the rm's optimal choice of capacity investment as its choice of the constant ow level of at-risk investment vathat will be maintained over the periods t2[1;M+1\u0000m], or equivalently as simply its choice of the stock of at-risk capacity Vaat the end of periodM+ 1\u0000m. Notice that the second condition in Assumption AII, which ensures that the maximum possible capacity-cost savings associated with a one-period delay in a small amount of capacity investment would not be worth it because this delay would cause the price at which the vaccine can be sold to fall by a su\u000eciently great amount, is guaranteed to be violated if the vaccine price is constant (or rising) through time. On the other hand, if the price is set equal to the social value of a dose so that P(t) = [1 + (T\u0000t)]\u0002\u000eh\u0000\u0014, then P0(t) would amount toc0(L) s< \u000eh , the same as the second condition in Assumption AI. With these assumptions, we can proceed to characterize the capacity invest- ments chosen by the government/social planner and by the rm as we did in 42the Benchmark Model. The expected overall cost to the country of the viral outbreak can be written as in writing (A1) we have implicitly assumed that the parameters sand mare su\u000eciently small so that the government's choice of ^Vasatis esL > (m+ 1) ^Va.26The interpretation of (A1) is analogous to that of (3) for the Benchmark Model. Using (A1), the rst-order condition that determines the socially optimal choice of at-risk capacity investment { that is, the at-risk capac- ity investment level ^Vathat minimizes the expected overall cost to the country of the viral outbreak { is given by @E[Cost (Va)] guaranteed by the convexity of the cost- of-capacity-installation c(v) function. We next turn to the capacity installation choices of the vaccine-producing rm. Again we take as exogenous the price that the rm receives for each dose of a vaccine that is deemed to be safe and e ective, but we now allow this price to be a function of time, P(t). The rm's expected pro ts can be interpretation of (A3) is analogous to that of (6) for the Benchmark Model. Using (A3), the rst-order condition that determines the pro t-maximizing choice of at-risk capacity investment for the rm, ~Va, (A4) with the again guaranteed by the convexity of the cost- of-capacity-installation function c(v). Finally, for purposes of comparison with (A2), it is helpful to rewrite (A4) in clear below, for any value of m,^Vawill approach zero as sapproaches zero and this assumption must be satis ed. 43We are now ready to compare the social and commercial incentives to install at-risk capacity in this modi ed model. We con rm for this setting the central message of Proposition 1 for the Benchmark Model, namely, that what is needed to align commercial and social incentives for investment in at-risk capacity is simply that the price per dose be set at the social value of the dose. To establish this, we set the vaccine price equal to the social value of a vaccine dose. That is, suppose the government could commit to purchase vaccine doses from the rm at the price ^P(t)\u0011[1 + (T\u0000t)]\u0002\u000eh\u0000\u0014fort\u0014T: (A6) Facing the price schedule in (A6), with (A2) con rms that the government can induce the rm to invest in the socially optimal level of at-risk capacity { that is the government can ensure that ~Va=^Va{ if it can commit to allow the rm to earn the social value of every vaccine dose that it sells. We summarize with: Proposition A1 In the model of this appendix, the timing of the rm's ca- pacity investments do not impact the total number of vaccine doses it can sell. Nevertheless, if the price per vaccine dose is set at the social value of each dose, ^P(t) = [1+(T\u0000t)]\u0002\u000eh\u0000\u0014, then commercial and social incentives for investment in at-risk capacity will be aligned, and ~Va=^Va. Together, Propositions 1 and A1 suggest that, if a government can commit to a price schedule for vaccine doses, then committing to set the price per dose at the social value of each dose would be a natural policy intervention for ensuring that socially optimal at-risk capacity investment is made by a vaccine-producing rm that locally sources its inputs. Notice that this policy intervention could be designed to take the form of an up-front commitment to pay the amount ^P(M+ 1)Lfor delivery of Ldoses of a safe and e ective vaccine at the beginning of periodt=M+1, combined with an appropriate \\penalty\" for late delivery (i.e., if fewer than Ldoses are delivered at the beginning of period t=M+ 1, then the lower price ^P(M+ 2) will be paid for each dose delivered at the beginning of periodt=M+ 2 up to the maximum total delivery of Ldoses, and so on 44applying the price schedule ^P(t) for any deliveries that occur at even later dates t=M+ 3 all the way until the nal possible delivery at date T). By design, in equilibrium a series of late deliveries would occur and penalties would be paid, re ecting the vaccine delivery and declining price schedule described by Proposition A1. This is reminiscent of the bonus payments for early delivery of vaccine doses observed in some of the US contracts as described in section 2. 8 Heterogeneous Susceptibility In this appendix we show that the main results from the Benchmark Model of section 3.1 and the model of appendix 7, as summarized in Propositions 1 and A1 respectively, are preserved when heterogeneity in susceptibility to the virus is introduced into the population. To proceed, we introduce one new assumption: rather than assuming that in every period when the virus is circulating each unvaccinated individual will be infected by the virus with probability \u000e2(0;1], we now assume that the sus- ceptibility to contracting the virus di ers across the population. We introduce this feature by assuming that the country under consideration is populated with a measure Lof citizens indexed by z2[0;L], and we assume that the prob- ability that individual zwill contract the virus in any period when individual zis unvaccinated is \u000e(z), where the function \u000eis strictly decreasing (by the convention of indexing citizens in order of decreasing susceptibility to the virus) and continuous (by assumption).27We can then de ne \u0001( V) forV2[0;L] as the measure of citizens z2[0;V] that, if unvaccinated, would contract the virus in any period, where \u0001( V) is given by \u0001(V)\u0011ZV 0\u000e(z)dzforV2[0;L]: (A8) This implies that, in the absence of a safe and e ective vaccine the expected cost imposed on the country by the virus amounts to \u0001( L)Th(rather than LT\u000eh as in the Benchmark Model and the model of appendix 7). Observe that (A8) implies that \u00010(V) =\u000e(V)>0 and \u000100(V) =\u000e0(V)<0, so that \u0001(V) is an increasing and concave function. This property ensures that the optimal allocation of Vvaccine doses for V <L in terms of maximizing the country's health bene ts of the Vdoses is to allocate doses to the most sus- ceptible citizens, i.e., to citizens z2[0;V]. The introduction of heterogeneous susceptibility therefore provides an additional reason, absent from the Bench- mark Model and the model of appendix 7, that capacity installed at an earlier date generates higher social value than additional capacity that is installed at a later date: the rst installment of capacity will be used to produce vaccine doses for those who are most susceptible to the virus and who therefore provide society with the greatest health bene ts from inoculation. Nevertheless, as we 27We could alternatively assume that the severity of illness hassociated with contracting the virus varies across the poulation, and derive identical results. 45next establish, it is still the case in each model that setting the price per vaccine dose equal to the social value, appropriately de ned, is su\u000ecient to provide the rm with the incentive to choose the socially optimal level of at-risk investment. 8.1 Heterogeneous susceptibility in the Benchmark Model We rst consider the Benchmark Model, augmented with the assumption of het- erogeneous susceptibility to the virus across the population as de ned above. Our Assumption I and Assumption II are su\u000ecient to deliver the same impli- cations in the present model as they do in the Benchmark Model, provided that\u000e(L)\u0015\u0016\u000efor some \u0016\u000e2(0;1) and with \u0016\u000ethen playing the role of \u000ein the statement of Assumption I, which we assume is the case henceforth. With these assumptions imposed, and with all other assumptions of the Benchmark Model in place, it is straightforward following the steps in section 3.1 to derive the objectives of the government and the vaccine-producing rm. For the government, under Assumption I and using ZL Va\u000e(z)dz=ZL 0\u000e(z)dz\u0000ZVa 0\u000e(z)dz\u0011\u0001(L)\u0000\u0001(Va) forVa\u0014L; the expected overall cost to the country of the viral outbreak is now E[Cost (Va)] =C(Va) +sc(L\u0000Va) + (1\u0000s)\u0001(L)Th+s[\u0001(L)Mh+ (\u0001(L)\u0000\u0001(Va))mh]; and the by +m\u000e(^Va)h] = 0; (A9) with the by the convexity of the cost-of- capacity-installation c(v) function and the concavity of \u0001( V). And for any xed price per dose ^Pthat satis es Assumption II, the expected pro ts of the vaccine-producing rm are now E[\u0019(Va)] =s[Va(T\u0000M) + (L\u0000Va)\u0002(T\u0000(M+m))]\u0002^P \u0000[C(Va) +sc(L\u0000Va)]; and the associated de convexity of the cost-of- capacity-installation function c(v). It is now immediate from (A9) and (A10) that, if the price of a vaccine dose is set equal to the social value of the last dose produced under the optimal level of at-risk capacity, that is, if ^P\u0011\u000e(^Va)h; (A11) then ~Va=^Va. Hence, relative to the result reported in Proposition 1, the only di erence here is that the social value of the marginal vaccine dose is no longer a constant\u000ehbut is rather a decreasing function \u000e(V)hof the number of doses that can be produced, V, and the price per dose must be set at the social value of the last dose that would be produced under the optimal level of at-risk capacity ^Va. 8.2 Heterogeneous susceptibility in the model of appendix 7 We next consider the model of appendix 7, augmented with the assumption of heterogeneous susceptibility to the virus across the population as de ned above. Here our Assumption AI and Assumption AII are su\u000ecient to deliver the same implications in the present model as they do in the model of appendix 7, provided that \u000e(L)\u0015\u0016\u000efor some \u0016\u000e2(0;1) and with \u0016\u000ethen playing the role of \u000ein the statement of Assumption AI, which we assume is the case henceforth. With these assumptions imposed, and with all other assumptions of the model of appendix 7 in place, it is straightforward to derive the objectives of the government and the vaccine-producing rm. For the government, and using ZL tVa\u000e(z)dz=ZL 0\u000e(z)dz\u0000ZtVa 0\u000e(z)dz\u0011\u0001(L)\u0000\u0001(tVa) fortVa\u0014L; the expected overall cost to the country of the viral outbreak is now E[Cost (Va)] =C(Va) +sc(L\u0000(m+ 1)Va) + (1\u0000s)\u0001(L)Th+s[\u0001(L)Mh+mX given by @E[Cost (Va)] @Va=C0(^Va)\u0000s[(m+1)\u0002c0(L\u0000(m+1)^Va)+mX t=1t\u000e(t^Va)s] = 0;(A12) with the second-order by the convexity of the cost-of- capacity-installation c(v) function and the concavity of \u0001( V). Similarly, the expected pro ts of the vaccine-producing rm facing a by the convexity of the cost-of- capacity-installation function c(v). As in the model of appendix 7, it is immediate from a comparison of (A12) and (A13) that if the price per vaccine dose is xed at its social value, where the social value of a vaccine dose in period tis evaluated at the socially optimal level of at-risk capacity and is de ned for period tas the social value of the last dose produced in period tgiven the socially optimal level of at-risk capacity, then we would have ^P(t)\u0011[1 + (T\u0000t)]\u0002\u000e((t\u0000M)^Va)h\u0000\u0014fort2[M+ 1;M+m];(A14) 1)\u00111 mmX \u0013=1[^P(M+\u0013)\u0000\u0013\u000e(\u0013^Va)h]\u0000\u0014; (A15) and facing the price (A14)-(A15), the rm's rst-order ~Va=^Va. 9 Linear Costs and Incomplete Information This appendix provides a fresh analysis of many of the major results of the paper but in a model with a simpler form for capacity costs, assuming linear 48rather than convex. This simpler functional form allows us to extend the anal- ysis in several directions. We endogenize the prices in procurement contracts o ered by the government. We extend the model to allow the rm to have pri- vate information about its productivity. This extension has a major advantage. Without private information, it turns out that the government can obtain the second best if allowed su\u000eciently rich procurement contracts. With private rm information, we show here that the government cannot obtain the second best under private information. We show that the best the government can do with optimal contracts involves more distortion dealing with a foreign input supplier than domestic. This provides a role for international cooperation that is robust regardless of how rich is the contracting space. Some of the longer proofs are relegated to the end of the appendix. 9.1 Model A country with a continuum of citizens with a mass normalized to 1 faces a viral outbreak. Absent a vaccine, the virus circulates in the population for teperiods, at which point the outbreak ends. The end of the outbreak could re ect the emergence of a highly contagious but benign variant of the virus after period tewhich dominates other variants, precluding serious harm from the disease after that point. Alternatively, period tecould re ect the date after which a repurposed generic drug is discovered to eliminate harm from the virus at very low cost. We take the outbreak to be of moderate enough duration that it is reasonable to abstract from discounting, setting the discount rate for all players to 0. We adopt a very simple model of the disease's epidemiology. Each period during the outbreak, an unvaccinated individual receives an independent and identically distributed (iid) draw of a Bernoulli random variable indicating their infection status, with 2(0;1] denoting the probability they are infected. An infected person is sick during the period and recovers by the period's end. Let h>0 denote the social harm from sickness. This factor re ects the individual's physical harm from illness as well as possible wage and education losses. It may also re ect broader social costs including the provision of medical services and economic output losses beyond the wage. To avoid the complication of changing population size over time, we assume (somewhat counterfactually for Covid-19) that infection does not result in death. This model abstracts from the dynamics of contagion, assuming an individual's chance of infection is independent of time and disease prevalence. Recovery does not confer immunity: a recovered person can be reinfected the next period, possibly capturing the circulation of new variants that escape antibodies generated by previous infections. A government Gseeks to maximize social welfare in the country by op- timizing the procurement of a vaccine. The government deals with a single, domestic, pro t-maximizing rm, which develops a promising vaccine candi- date in period 0. We initially analyze the case of integrated domestic supply, shown in one panel of Figure A1. In this case, the rm produces the vaccine with domestically sourced inputs produced completely within the rm bound- 49aries. Later, we will analyze cases, shown in other panels of the gure, in which the vaccine producer ( D) obtains inputs from a separate rm ( U), located in the same or a di erent country in depending on the case analyzed. Clinical trials for the vaccine take time, spanning periods t= 1 through periodta\u00001. We abstract from clinical-trial costs, re ecting the reality that they are eclipsed by capacity and production costs for vaccines supplied at pandemic scales (see cost estimates in Snyder et al. (2020)). After receiving the data on safety and e\u000ecacy after the completion of clinical trials, in period ta, a regulator determines whether to approve the vaccine for use. The vaccine cannot be used unless and until it is approved. The regulator is non-strategic, basing its decision on an objective analysis of the clinical-trial data. Let s2(0;1] be the probability that the vaccine candidate succeeds in clinical trials and is approved. The vaccine o ers only non-durable protection: a dose only protects a person vaccinated at the beginning of the period against infection for the duration of that period. One interpretation, re ective of th is that continual protection requires an individual to receive a booster each period. A vaccinated person receives a draw of a Bernoulli random variable, iid across people and periods, indicating the e\u000ecacy of the dose, with \u00122(0;1] denoting the probability that the dose is e ective. We model vaccine production as a two-step process. An input (say the vaccine's active ingredient) produced in an upstream facility Uis shipped to downstream facility Dthat lls a vial with the input and other additives con- stituting a nished dose. As mentioned, we begin by assuming the two facilities are located domestically and integrated in the same rm. In any period t, input production cannot exceed U's capacity Qt. Capacity costs kper unit to install. After it is installed, one unit of capacity can produce the input requirement for one vaccine dose each period thereafter. Capacity is sunk and cannot be repurposed to manufacture other pharmaceuticals or products.28Besides the capacity cost, each unit of input involves a marginal production cost of c. In sum, input production involves linear capacity and production costs. We ab- stract from capacity and production costs involved in transforming the input into a nal vaccine dose, assuming that is done costlessly and is not capacity constrained. The rm can choose to install any amount of capacity in any period in as many tranches as it chooses. Without further assumptions, it is evident that it is both pro table and socially e\u000ecient to hold o investing until after regulatory approval to avoid sinking capacity investment for a candidate that ends up failing. However, we assume that installing capacity takes time: in particular, capacity installation begun in a certain period is not completed and cannot begin producing until t`periods later. The lag of t`periods provides a rationale for investing before period the ta, while clinical trials are still underway, referred to as \\at-risk\" investment. At-risk investment trades o of wasted capacity 28An equivalent alternative assumption is that capacity is fungible but only imperfectly so, withkcapturing the value lost in repurposing. 50Figure A1: Organization and Trade Structures Analyzed Integrated domestic supply input vaccineUnintegrated domestic supply Unintegrated foreign supply 51investment if the vaccine candidate fails against earlier availability of capacity allowing production of doses with less of a lag to if the candidate succeeds. Once installation process is underway, we abstract from any option value from abandoning it; the kcapacity cost per unit of the capacity installation begun then is expended in any event. It turns out to be convenient to adopt the accounting convention associating capacity investment with the period in which it is started. Thus, we let xtdenote new capacity investment started in period t, which will not be productive until at least period t+t`(later if approval does not come until later). To avoid a taxonomy of uninteresting cases, assume that t`,ta, andteare natural numbers ordered as t`\u0014ta<ta+t`<te: (A17) The rst inequality implies that capacity can be installed at least as quickly as clinical trials can be completed, opening up the possibility of starting at-risk ca- pacity installation early enough that it is ready for production immediately upon vaccine approval in period ta. The last inequality implies that the pandemic lasts long enough after the approval date that there will be positive demand in some periods for capacity installed on or after that date, which we will refer to as capacity installed \\not at risk.\" If at-risk capacity provides has too much of an advantage over not-at-risk capacity, the analysis becomes uninteresting because the rm's private incen- tives will favor at-risk capacity without any need for external inducement. The following condition turns out to be necessary and su\u000ecient to rule out that uninteresting case: 1\u0000s>t` te\u0000ta: (A18) In words, the condition says that the probability of failure must exceed the pro- portion of the post-approval period that can only be served by at-risk capacity. LettingXrdenote total at-risk capacity installed and Xntotal not-at-risk capacity installed, we have Xr=Pta\u00001 t=1xtandXn=Pte t=taxt. Since there is no discounting and capacity cost is linear, it is immediate that, rather than spreading each of XrandXnout in tranches, the capacity strategy that is both weakly pro table and weakly socially e\u000ecient is to undertake each investment all together as early as possible. Installation of Xrshould start in period 1, and installation of Xnshould start in period ta. By de nition, installation of Xn cannot start before taor else it would be classi ed as at-risk capacity. The rm can pursue one of two strategies for utilizing at-risk capacity Xr. It can delay utilization until period tawhen it learns whether the vaccine has been approved, or it can utilize Xrwhile clinical trials are being run to build a stock- pile ready to augment supplies rolled out after period ta. The advantage of the delay strategy is that it avoids wasting production costs for the stockpile if the vaccine candidate fails to be approved. On the other hand, stockpiling allows a given quantity of vaccine to be produced using less capacity. We acknowl- edge that stockpiling is both a theoretically interesting strategy and practically 52Figure A2: Timeline for Model Vaccine developedRegulatory completed1doses each period ...2doses each period relevant in the Covid-19 pandemic; but to simplify the analysis, we abstract from stockpiling, assuming either that the vaccine has a limited shelf life, pre- cluding the storage of a stockpile, or that the lag between the start of capacity investment and its completion is roughly the same as that between a vaccine's development and regulatory approval, i.e., t`\u0019ta. Either assumption would preclude utilization of at-risk capacity before period tato build a stockpile. The simplicity of the capacity-investment strategy allows for a simple de- piction of the model's timing, shown in Figure A2. The vaccine is developed in period 0. Clinical trials last from period 1 to period ta\u00001. The regulator makes the approval decision in period ta. At risk capacity Xrthat was installed in period 1 is the only capacity available from period tatota+t`\u00001. In period ta+t`, the lag between when installation of not-at-risk capacity Xnstarts, in periodta, and when it becomes available for production is over. From period ta+t`to the last pandemic period te\u00001, combined capacity Xr+Xnis available. The amount of available capacity is the only di erence among the periods after regulatory approval. Given that infected individuals recover by the end of the period and immunizations only provide one period of protection, the consumer population looks identical at the start over every period between ta andte. LetQ1denote the output produced with capacity Xreach period from timetatota+t`\u00001 (a time interval indicated by the rst shaded box in Figure A2). Let Q2denote the output produced each period with capacity Xr+Xnfrom period ta+t`tote\u00001 (a time interval indicated by the second shaded box in the gure). Since supply and demand conditions are identical across periods within each shaded interval, specifying a constant output per period in each shaded interval is without loss of generality. In the subsequent analysis, we will see that various organization and trade structures generate the same equilibria for some parameter vectors, only re- vealing distinctions for other vectors. Similarly, equilibria \\tie\" the rst best for some parameter vectors, only revealing ine\u000eciencies for other vectors. To 53smooth out comparisons, we will introduce the device of a distribution of pa- rameter vectors from which the one under consideration is drawn. This device will allow us to conduct the analysis for a single, representative parameter vec- tor while still allowing us to make coherent statements comparing structures such as at-risk investment being more likely or welfare higher on average in one structure than another. Capacity cost kturns out to span the relevant outcome space, so for concreteness we will specify just that parameter being a random variable drawn from a distribution having probability density function (pdf) f(k) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(k) on support [0 ;K], where Kcan be in nite. Assume F(k) is logconcave, a property exhibited by most commonly used distributions in practice (Bagnoli and Bergstrom 2005). We will initially assume the draw of kis publicly observed ex ante, so the game remains one of complete information. 9.2 Integrated Domestic Supply In this section, we analyze the case of integrated domestic supply, adhering to the model introduced in the previous section, corresponding to the structure depicted in the lower left panel of Figure A1. We begin by characterizing the rst best, maximizing domestic social welfare. We then solve for the rm's equilibrium capacity and output levels for an arbitrary per-dose price o ered by the government. Finally, we solve for the optimal procurement policy for a government that faces a social cost of public funds or that discounts producer relative to consumer surplus. 9.2.1 First Best To characterize the rst best, we will solve for the optimum chosen by a social planner that internalizes consumer and producer surplus, that faces no social cost of public funds, and that controls all the operations of the integrated rm. The planner controls all rm operations, including the rm's capacity de- cisions, which, as argued in Section 9.1, can be reduced to two choices: the amount of at-risk capacity Xrand not-at-risk capacity Xn. The planner also controls the rm's output path over the post-regulatory-approval time inter- val. In general, this output path could be quite complicated; but as we saw in Section 9.1, simplifying features of the model reduced it to two quantities, Q1, produced from period tatota+t`\u00001 using at-risk capacity Xr, andQ2, produced from period ta+t`toteusing combined capacity Xr+Xn. Expected consumer harm over the pandemic is given in equation (A20) re ects the disease harms experienced over the pandemic in the absence of a vacine, equal to the mass of infected consumers 54each period , times the harm h, times the pandemic duration te. The next term re ects the expected reduction in harm from the Q1doses supplied each period when only at-risk capacity is available times the duration of that interval. The bene t of those doses are scaled by the probability of success sand e\u000ecacy \u0012. The last term re ects the expected reduction in harm from the Q2doses supplied each period after not-at-risk capacity comes online to supplement at- risk capacity. Expected total production cost over the pandemic is given by ta+t`\u00001X t=tascQ1+te\u00001X t=ta+t`scQ2=scQ1t`+scQ2(te\u0000ta\u0000t`): (A21) Production costs are only expended if the vaccine is approved, so all terms in (A21) are scaled by the probability of success s. Expected total capacity cost is given by kXr+skXn: (A22) The investment cost associated with at-risk capacity is expended with certainty, but that associated with not-at-risk capacity is only expended conditional on successful approval, with probability s. The rst best minimizes three sources of cost in (A20), (A21), and (A22). Adding the three equations, rearranging, and recasting the minimization of costs as the equivalent maximization of its negative (to facilitate later comparison to the rm's pro t-maximization problem), the rst-best problem can be expressed is no bene t from vaccinating more than the total population mass, normalized to 1. Constraints (A25) and (A26) ensure output cannot exceed available capacity in the relevant periods. The maximization problem in equations (A23){(A26) is a linear program. Linear programs typically involve corner solutions, and that is the case here. Both optimal capacity and optimal output are corner solutions. If the optimum involves positive output, it can be implemented soley with at-risk capacity, or if not, soley with not-at-risk investment. Su\u000ecient capacity is installed to vacci- nate the entire population each period. Optimal output fully utilizes available capacity. Formally, we have the following lemma, where two stars added as subscripts indicate rst-best values of endogenous variables. 55Lemma A1 The maximization problem in (A23) solution is X\u0003 r=Q\u0003 1=Q\u0003 2= 1andX\u0003 n= 0. The proof of the lemma, provided at the end of this appendix, is based on the Kuhn-Tucker conditions from the linear program (A23){(A26). The lemma streamlines the search for the rst-best solution when k < \u0016k\u0003 down to a comparison of two alternatives, investing in population-level capacity at risk or investing in that capacity level not at risk. Substituting X\u0003 r=Q\u0003 1= the planner's expected surplus from fully investing at (A23), the planner's expected surplus from fully investing not at risk is \u0000 hte+s(\u0012 h\u0000c)(te\u0000ta\u0000t`)\u0000sk: (A29) Setting (A28) equal to shows that the planner is indif- ferent between the two investment strategies if and only if s(\u0012 h\u0000c)t`= (1\u0000s)k: (A30) The left-hand side re ects the advantage from shifting a unit of capacity from the not-at-risk earlier to the at-risk tranche. The shift allows another individual to be vaccinated during the lag t`it takes for not-at-risk capacity to start producing after initial approval. The advantage only materializes if the vaccine candidate is approved, with probability s. The right-hand side of (A30) refects the option value of waiting to install the unit of capacity. If the vaccine fails to be approved, with probability 1 \u0000s, the rm can save the social cost kof investing in that unit of capacity. Rearranging equation (A30) gives a threshold capacity cost in the rst best ^k\u0003=s 1\u0000s(\u0012 h\u0000c)t`; (A31) such that the planner strictly prefers at-risk investment if and only k<^k\u0003. The planner nds at-risk investment more attractive the higher the probability of successs, the higher is e\u000ecacy \u0012, the more infectious and harmful the disease andh, the longer the lag in capacity installation t`, and the lower is production costc. Figure A3 provides a schematic diagram of rst-best capacity investment askvaries. For k2[0;^k\u0003), the rst-best involves investing in enough at- risk capacity to serve the population. For k2(^k\u0003;\u0016k\u0003), the rst best involves 56Figure A3: Optimal Capacity Investments as Functions of k 0At-risk capacity = 1() =()()Not-at-risk capacity No capacityFirst best 0At-risk capacity = 1 1+ = 1+()Not-at-risk capacity No capacitySecond best investing in enough not-at-risk capacity to serve the population. For k>\u0016k\u0003, the rst best involves no investment. The interval of at-risk investing has positive measure if and only if \u0012 h>c; (A32) ensuring that a dose's social value exceeds its production cost, a minimal condi- tion to justify any capacity investment.29The interval of not-at-risk investing is nonempty if and only if, in addition to condition (A32), condition (A18) holds. 9.2.2 Procurement from Nationalized Firm We next turn to the optimal vaccine procurement policy for the government. Assume the government maximizes domestic social welfare, the sum of the sur- pluses of domestic consumers and producers. Government expenditures must be nanced with distortionary taxation. Let \u0015 > 0 denote the social cost of public funds. Each dollar of government spending reduces its surplus by 1 + \u0015 dollars. We start with the case of a nationalized rm, allowing the government con- trol over all the rms operations including capacity and output decisions. The government's objective function is the same as the planner's in the rst-best problem (A23) except that everywhere cost parameters korcappear, they need to be scaled by 1 + \u0015since the government now directly covers those costs with tax revenue. We will sometimes refer to this outcome as the second best: \\best\" in the sense that the principal has full control of the agent's operations, just as the planner in the rst best did; only \\second\" best, however, because 29We will not introduce (A32) as a maintained assumption here, waiting to introduce a slightly stronger version of the condition (integrating consideration of the social cost of public funds, to be de ned) in the next subsection. 57of the distortion involved in making transfers. Whereas rst-best values of vari- ables were distinguished by one star, second-best values will be distinguished by two stars. It is straightforward to see that identical analysis to the previous subsection applies here except with cost parameters candkmultiplied by 1 + \u0015. For example, a lemma equivalent to Lemma A1 holds, except that the cuto capacity cost above which there is no investment is now given by (1 +\u0015)\u0016k\u0003\u0003= [\u0012 h\u0000(1 +\u0015)c](te\u0000ta\u0000t`): (A33) Dividing through by 1 equivalent expression \u0016k\u0003\u0003=\u0012\u0012 h 1 +\u0015\u0000c\u0013 (te\u0000ta\u0000t`): (A34) This is identical to the threshold for a social planner facing no social cost of public funds except that the marginal social bene t of a vaccine dose \u0012 hhas to be discounted by 1 + \u0015to re ect the fact that that surplus is generated with distortionary taxation. The same logic suggests that the threshold capacity cost determining whether investment is at-risk or not-at-risk is given by ^k\u0003\u0003=s 1\u0000s\u0012\u0012 h 1 +\u0015\u0000c\u0013 t`: (A35) Fork<^k\u0003\u0003, the government \u0000 hte+s[\u0012 h\u0000(1 +\u0015)c](te\u0000ta)\u0000(1 +\u0015)k: (A36) Fork>^k\u0003\u0003, the government providing surplus \u0000 hte+s[\u0012 h\u0000(1 +\u0015)c](te\u0000ta\u0000t`)\u0000s(1 +\u0015)k: (A37) As expected, these expressions for second-best surplus are identical to the rst best in (A28){(A29) except that all cost parameters have been scaled up by 1 +\u0015. It is immediate that the rst best is recovered from the second best in the limit as \u0015#0. Figure A3 provides a visual comparison of rst-best and second-best invest- ment policies. We see that the second-best threshold ^k\u0003\u0003between investing at risk and investing not at risk has been shifted down relative to its rst-best analogue ^k, shrinking the interval of at-risk investment. The second-best cuto \u0016k\u0003\u0003down above which there is no investment has also been shifted down relative to\u0016k\u0003, enlarging the no-investment interval. An increase in \u0015would exaggerate the shifts shown. As the gure makes clear, on average across the distribution ofk, there is too little at-risk investment and too little investment overall in the second best compared to the rst best for all \u0015 > 0. It is also clear from inspecting the axis labels in the gure that the interval in which there is at-risk investment in the second best is nonempty if and only if \u0012 h> (1 +\u0015)c: (A38) 58This condition says that the marginal social value of a dose justi es the produc- tion cost even if that cost has to be paid with funds raised with distortionary taxation. We will maintain assumption (A38) throughout the remainder of the paper to avoid a taxonomy of trivial cases. 9.2.3 Procuring from Privatized Firm Via Linear Price We next study the optimal government policy toward a privatized rm. In this structure, the rm operates independently of the government, undertaking capacity and output decisions to maximize pro t. Even though the government does not control the operations of the rm, we continue to assume that the government internalizes its pro ts. Still, the government seeks to limit transfers to the rm because the social cost of public funds generates deadweight loss \u0015 for every dollar transferred. In principle, the government and rm might bargain over the terms of the bilateral deal. To simplify the analysis and to give this structure the best chance of generating a socially e\u000ecient outcome, we will have the government move rst, making a take-it-or-leave-it o er. For now, we restrict the government to o ering a simple linear price p, as observed in many bilateral deals during the Covid-19 pandemic. These assumptions set up a sequential game of perfect information between the government and the rm. The government moves rst, o ering price p. The rm moves second, basing its capacity and output decisions on p. We solve for the subgame perfect equilibrium using backward induction, starting by determining the rm's best response to any p. Firm's Best Response As was the case with the social planner, the rm has two relevant capacity choices, XrandXn, and two relevant output choices, Q1 andQ2. The rm chooses these variables to maximize its pro t max Xr;Xn;Q1;Q2\u00150[sQ1(p\u0000c)t`+sQ2(p\u0000c)(te\u0000ta\u0000t`)\u0000kXr\u0000skXn];(A39) subject to the same constraints, (A24){(A26), faced by the planner. One can show that the characterization of the planner's optimum in Lemma A1 as one of three corner solutions also applies to the rm's pro t-maximization problem. The proof, based on Kuhn-Tucker conditions, uses nearly identical logic as the proof of Lemma A1 and so is omitted. Determining the rm's best response thus boils down to a comparison of the alternative of investing in population-level capacity at risk, yielding expected pro t \u0019r=s(p\u0000c)(te\u0000ta)\u0000k; (A40) versus investing in population-level capacity not-at-risk, yielding expected pro t \u0019n=s(p\u0000c)(te\u0000ta\u0000t`)\u0000sk; (A41) versus not investing at all, yielding zero pro t. 59The rm's pro t from investing at risk (A40) weakly exceeds its pro t from investing not at risk (A41) if p\u0015c+(1\u0000s)k st`: (A42) One can show that (A42) ensures that (A40) is positive when assumption (A18) holds. Thus, the rm is willing to invest at risk when (A42) holds. If the price is in the intermediate range p2\u0014 c+k te\u0000ta\u0000t`;c+(1\u0000s)k st`\u0015 ; (A43) then the rm is willing to invest not at risk instead of investing at risk or not investing at all. One can show that assumption (A18) ensures that the interval in (A43) has positive measure. If the price is below the interval in (A43), then the rm prefers not to invest. Government Price Setting Fold the game back to the government's rst- stage choice of p. By varying pover the intervals de ned in (A42) and (A43), the government can induce one of three rm strategies. First, suppose the government wishes to incentivize at-risk investment by setting a psatisfying (A42). The rm installs producing Q\u0003 1=Q\u0003 2= 1 each period surplus \u0000 hte+s[\u0012 h\u0000(1 +\u0015)p](te\u0000ta) +\u0019r: (A44) The rst two terms re ect health losses and distortionary expenditures paying for the vaccine. (Both can be appropriately categorized as aspects of consumer surplus supposing that consumers pay for expenditures through taxes.) The last term re ects domestic rm's pro t, which the government internalizes. Substi- tuting for\u0019rfrom hte+s[\u0012 h\u0000c\u0000\u0015p](te\u0000ta)\u0000k: (A45) This objective is decreasing in psince transfers involve a distortion due to the social cost of public funds. Thus, the optimal price inducing at-risk investing is the lowest price satisfying (A42), i.e., p=c+(1\u0000s)k st`: (A46) Substituting Since @M(k;\u0015)=@\u0015 =M(k;\u0015)=\u0015, assumption (A18) ensures @M(k;\u0015)=@\u0015 > 0 as well. Comparing (A47) to (A36), we see that the government obtains less surplus when it inducing at-risk investment from a privatized rm than from a national- ized rm. The surplus di erence is equal to M(k;\u0015), re ecting the government's loss due to the moral-hazard problem, requiring it to pay a premium to induce at-risk investment. The price premium would net out of social welfare if \u0015= 0 and there were no social cost of public funds but is socially costly when \u0015>0. Next, suppose instead that the government wishes to incentivize not-at-risk investment by setting a psatisfying (A43). The rm installs X\u0003 r= 0 andX\u0003 n= 1, producing Q\u0003 1= 0 in the period during which capacity is ramped up andQ\u0003 2= 1 each period from ta+t`on, surplus \u0000 hte+s[\u0012 h\u0000(1 +\u0015)p](te\u0000ta\u0000t`) +\u0019n: (A49) As before, the rst terms re ect health losses and distortionary expendi- tures to pay for the vaccine, and the last term represents the domestic rm's pro t, which the government internalizes. Substituting for \u0019nfrom (A41) and simplifying, (A49) can be written \u0000 hte+s[\u0012 h\u0000c\u0000\u0015p](te\u0000ta\u0000t`)\u0000sk: (A50) This objective is decreasing in p, so is maximized subject to (A43) by setting a price equal to the lower bound of the interval: p=c+k te\u0000ta\u0000t`: (A51) Substituting (A51) into (A50) and rearranging yields the same expression for government surplus as it obtains in the second best, given in equation (A37). Equating the government's continuation payo from inducing at-risk to its continuation payo from inducing not-at-risk investment (A37) and solving for kyields the threshold capacity cost ^kp=^k\u0003\u0003\u0000M(^kp;\u0015) (1\u0000s)(1 +\u0015); (A52) where the superscript indicates an optimal variable in the case of a privatized rm o ered a price contract. The equilibrium involves at-risk investment if k<^kpand not-at-risk investment if k2(^kp;\u0016k\u0003\u0003). Comparing (A35) and (A52), we see that ^kpand^k\u0003\u0003di er only by the last term in (A52), which is proportional to M(^kp;\u0015). SinceM(^kp;\u0015)>0, we have ^kp<^k\u0003\u0003, implying that there is less at-risk investment in equilibrium than in the second best. This establishes the following proposition. Proposition A2 Under maintained assumptions, ^kp<^k\u0003\u0003, implying the gov- ernment induces less at-risk investment on average across the distribution of k 61when procuring vaccine via a linear-price contract from a privatized rm com- pared to the second best in which the government controls the operations of a nationalized rm. Counterfactual Control over Investment Timing As a counterfactual exercise to build intuition, we will imagine that the the government has one additional lever of control over the privatized rm, the power to control the timing of investment, perhaps choosing to ban at-risk investment or to ban not- at-risk investment. Even with this additional authority, the government still has less authority than it has over a nationalized rm. There, the government can control capacity and output levels directly at extensive and intensive margins. In the counterfactual exercise here, the government has no direct authority over intensive-margin decisions and cannot force the rm to invest. It can only incentivize those decisions indirectly via the price, with one additional lever of control over when capacity can be installed. That limited additional authority to control investment timing is all the government needs to attain the second best. We propose that the following government policy will deliver the second best. If the conditions are such that the second best involves at-risk investment, i.e., k<^k\u0003\u0003, the government bans not-at-risk investment and o ers the rm a price allowing it to just break even under at-risk investment, p=c+k s(te\u0000ta); (A53) found by setting at-risk pro t (A40) equal to 0. Similarly, if the conditions are such that the second best involves not-at-risk investment, i.e., k2(^k\u0003\u0003;\u0016k\u0003\u0003), the government bans at-risk investment and o ers the rm a price allowing it to just break even under not-at-risk investment. This price was computed above in equation (A51). To verify that the proposed policy delivers the second best, rst suppose k < ^k\u0003\u0003. The rm breaks even at the o ered price (A53) so has no strict incentive to deviate to not investing. Given it is forbidden from investing not-at- risk, it invests at risk in equilibrium. Substituting price (A53) into the relevant surplus function for the government (A45) yields the expression for second- best government surplus in (A36). Supposing, next, that k2(^k\u0003\u0003;\u0016k\u0003\u0003), similar arguments can be used to rule out deviations by the rm from the desired not-at- risk investment strategy and to show that the government earns the second-best surplus. The proposed policy has the government banning at-risk investment k2 (^k\u0003\u0003;\u0016k\u0003\u0003). In fact, this ban is unnecessary. The discussion following equation (A43) showed that the rm earns negative pro t from investing at risk if paid the break-even price for investing not at risk. Proposition A3 Suppose that the government, in addition to o ering a linear- price contract to a privatized rm, also has the authority to forbid not-at-risk 62investment. This limited amount of additional authority is su\u000ecient to allow the government to attain the second-best surplus. In the language of contract theory, we can think of incentive-compatibility constraints ensuring that the rm undertakes the desired form of investment (at- risk or not-at-risk) and individual-rationality constraints ensuring that the rm at least breaks even under that form of investment. Incentive compatibility only binds for at-risk investment. For not-at-risk investment, if individual rationality binds, incentive compatibility is slack. The analysis in this subsection has pinpointed the source of moral hazard with a privitized rm. The linearity of costs eliminates the problems of under- capacity and undersupply; the government can obtain the second best without controlling those as shown in Proposition A3. The moral-hazard problem re- gards the timing of capacity installation: the rm has too little private incentive for at-risk investment. If the government could (counterfactually) ban later in- vestment, it could eliminate moral hazard entirely and obtain the second best. 9.2.4 Procuring from Privatized Firm Via Richer Contracts The government can improve upon the surplus obtained from its deal with a privatized rm by moving to richer alternatives to the linear-price contract. Capacity Subsidy One alternative is to combine a linear price with a sub- sidy for at-risk capacity investment. The government can observe when the investment is made and agree only to subsidize capacity installed before period ta. Let\u001bdenote the per-unit subsidy. Assume \u001bis paid at the start of period tafor each unit of capacity completed by then whether or not the vaccine is successful. We claim that a contract of this form can attain the second-best surplus. In particular, the per-dose price can be set to cover production cost, pr=c, and the at-risk capacity subsidy can be set to cover the per-unit capacity cost,\u001br=k, where the superscript indicates the optimal provisions of a richer alternative to a linear-price contract. By construction, this contract allows the rm to just break even if it invests at risk. It would earn negative pro t from investing not at risk because capacity investment undertaken later would not be covered. Thus, the contract induces the rm to invest at risk. It is immediate that the government can attain the second-best surplus with this contract for all ksuch that the second best involves at-risk investment, i.e., k <^k\u0003\u0003. The contract induces the same investment strategy as in the second best in that case. The contract only transfers enough to the rm to allow it to break even in expectation, so economizes on the social cost of public funds to the extent possible. Fork2(^k\u0003\u0003;\u0016k\u0003\u0003), the second best involves investing not at risk. The con- tract with capacity subsidy \u001br=kandpr=cworks for these parameters as well. But the richer contracts are not needed for these parameters. We showed in the previous subsection that there is no moral-hazard problem in inducing not-at-risk investment with a linear price. The goverment can attain the second 63best o ering a simple linear-price contract to the privatized rm. No additional capacity subsidy is needed. In sum, for all k>0, some combination of a capac- ity subsidy and a linear price allows the government to obtain the second-best surplus. Bonus Price for Early Doses Another alternative contract that allows the government to attain the second-best surplus rm involves two prices, a bonus pricep1for doses sold in periods tathroughta+t`\u00001, which could only have been produced with at-risk capacity, and a second, potentially lower price p2 covering production cost for doses sold after that. One can check that setting pr 1=c+k=st`and allows the rm to just break even if it invests at risk. If the rm invests not at risk, it earns negative pro t under this two-price contract because it would not earn any bonus. Only its production costs, not its capacity costs, would then be covered and no bon. The contract with bonus for early delivery thus works to induce at-risk investment, and provides the government with the second-best surplus. Again, the rm can use the bonus-price strategy if k<^k\u0003\u0003, and default back to a single linear-price contract that induces investment not at risk if k2(^k\u0003\u0003;\u0016k\u0003\u0003). A single-price contract can be viewed as a trivial special case of a two-price contract. In this way, the government can attain the second-best surplus for all k>0. Comparing Alternative Contracts The alternative contracts are more closely aligned than might rst appear, as revealed by a comparison of the total govern- ment expenditure entailed beyond the constant linear price. The government's total expenditure on the capacity subsidy (at least in states in which it is opti- mal to induce at-risk investment) is \u001br=k. We envisioned this amount being paid in a lump sum in period tawhether or not the vaccine is approved. Equiva- lently, the payment could be prorated over the t`periods starting from taduring which vaccines were only available due to at-risk investment. The prorated pay- ment, again made whether or not the vaccine is approved, would be k=t`per period. Equivalently, the prorated payments could be promised only conditional on success. To keep the expected payment constant, the conditional payment would need to be scaled up by the reciprocal of the probability of success s, in which case the per-period capacity payment would become k=st`. But note this is exactly the markup over cost paid for early doses in the bonus-price scheme. In our simple model, therefore, the capacity subsidy is isomorphic to the bonus-price scheme. They both provide the same extra incentive payment in expectation. The capacity payment is an example of what the innovation lit- erature calls \\push funding,\" covering investment cost unconditional on the project's success. While push funding is sometimes criticized for dulling incen- tives, here push funding is only provided for the type of investment desired; strong, direct incentives for at-risk investment are provided. The bonus-price scheme is an example of what the innovation literature calls \\pull funding,\" paying the bonus conditional on success. Conditioning on success is not the source of incentives for at-risk investing here. Rather, it is that the bonus is 64only paid for early doses, providing incentives for the only type of investment that can produce them. Since the prorating of the payment and the condition- ing on success are irrelevant to at-risk investment incentives, we can specify the the formulas can convert from one to the other without changing the power of the incentive scheme. 9.3 Unintegrated Input Supply In this section, we consider an alternative organizational structure for the rm. Instead of taking input supplier Uand vaccine manufacturer Dto be two di- visions within the same rm as done in the previous section, in this section we will take them to be separate rms, each maximizing their individual pro ts. A variety of models have been proposed for transaction costs and/or con- tractual frictions between rms, and it is hard to say which is the leading one. To avoid having a speci c transactions-cost model drive the results, perhaps limiting their generality, we will suppose that UandDengage in e\u000ecient con- tracting, arrived at via Nash bargaining. Assume bargaining takes place early enough ex ante to allow them to contract on the e\u000ecient capacity decision and the e\u000ecient production decision. In our partial-equilibrium setting, it is natural to focus on pro ts earned from sales to the government under consideration and abstract from external operations. This is accomplished in our Nash-bargaining protocol by setting rm's threat points to 0. Let 2[0;1] denoteU's bargain- ing share and 1\u0000 denoteD's. When we move to a structure in which Uis located in a foreign country, will represent the foreign rm's bargaining share, a useful mnemonic device. 9.3.1 Domestic Input Supplier It is obvious that a move from an integrated to an unintegrated supplier does not change the rst-best outcome if the planner is allowed full control over both rm's operations. Nothing about the rm's production technology is changed, and the contractual relationship between rm divisions is irrelevant to planner control. Similarly, the move from integrated to unintegrated supplier does not change the outcome with nationalized rms if the government is allowed full control over both rm's operations. With a moment's re ection, one can see that the move from integrated to unintegrated supplier does not change the equilibrium with privatized rms. Whatever contract the government o ers Dwill pass through to Uvia e\u000ecient bargaining to induce joint-pro t-maximizing capacity decisions, the same as the integrated rm. 9.3.2 Foreign Input Supplier In this subsection, we continue to suppose that Dis a domestic, downstream rm but now move U's location to a foreign country. The structure is depicted in the right panel of Figure A1. 65The previous section argued that changing the rm's organizational struc- ture without changing its location has no direct e ect on rm operations|by construction since we assumed rms bargain e\u000eciently. Moving Uto a foreign country has no direct e ect on rms' operation because of e\u000ecient bargain- ing between them. However, we will uncover an indirect e ect of the combined organization and location change. The combined change will change the govern- ment willingness to let rents ow to the rm. Assuming that the government internalizes the surplus of domestic consumers and domestic producers only, transfers owing to foreign rms will not be credited to the government's \\sur- plus ledger.\" Rather than subtracting only the \u0015per dollar transferred, as the case with a domestic rm, the government subtracts o 1 + \u0015for each dollar transferred to a foreign rm. This will provide the government with stronger incentives to economize on transfers, leading it to induce less at-risk investment, reducing social welfare. Suppose for now that the domestic government procures vaccine from D using a linear-price contract. The analysis of a linear contract o ered to an integrated, domestic rm provided in Section 9.2.3 carries over with little mod- i cation here. Firms best respond to a given price pwith the same investment and output decisions as before. E\u000ecient bargaining leads the unintegrated rm to operate as joint-pro t maximizers, and their location in di erent countries is irrelevant to their interaction. The expressions for government surplus change. Government surplus from prices inducing at-risk investment and not-at-risk investment, respectively, given by by equations (A44) and (A49) when the government procures from identical to their analogues except that the pro t terms are scaled by 1\u0000 to re ect the fact that the government internalizes domestic but not foreign rm pro t. This small change to the speci cation of government surplus does not a ect the logic of the analysis in from Section 9.2.3. Sparing the details, one can show that the threshold capacity cost below which the government induces at-risk investment and above which it induces not-at-risk investment is given by ^kf=^k\u0003\u0003\u0000M(^kf; +\u0015) (1\u0000s)(1 +\u0015); (A56) This is identical to the analogous threshold when the government procures from an integrated domestic supplier except that the second argument of the moral- hazard term M(k; +\u0015) re ects a greater disutility from making transfers to the rm. In addition to the social cost of public funds \u0015, the share of pro ts leaking to the foreign rm is an additional factor pushing the government further toward economizing on the price premium needed to induce at-risk investment. 66We showed above that M(k;\u0015) is increasing in its second argument. Since it is being subtracted o , it is immediate that > 0 implies ^kf<^kp, so equilibrium with a foreign input supplier involves less at-risk investment than with an integrated domestic supplier as long as the foreign supplier has some positive bargaining weight. The amount of at-risk investment with a foreign input higher falls the higher is . Proposition A4 Under maintained assumptions, ^kf\u0014^kp, with strict inequal- ity when >0. Thus, the government induces less at-risk investment on average across the distribution of kwhen procuring vaccine via a linear-price contract from an unintegrated privatized rm with foreign input supplier than from an integrated domestic rm. If instead of just the input supplier, both rms (or the whole integrated rm) is located in a foreign country, at-risk investment would be lower still. Instead of +\u0015, the second argument of the moral-hazard term M(^kf; +\u0015) in (A56) changes from +\u0015to 1 +\u0015, an increase for all <1, increasing the moral-hazard term, reducing the at-risk investment threshold. If the government is able to use richer contracts like those analyzed in Sec- tion 9.2.4, then the location of the input supplier may no longer matter. For example, suppose it o ers a capacity subsidy \u001br=kand linear price pr=c. As we saw, this works to induce the second-best investment strategy. But it also allows the government to attain the second-best surplus. To see, this, note that the contract with capacity subsidy just allows the rm to break even. Hence the pro ts\u0019rand\u0019nequal 0 in equilibrium, so the fact that they have lower coef- cients in the surplus function facing a foreign rm is irrelevant. The surpluses are the same as in the second best. 9.4 Incomplete Information The irrelevance of the foreign rm location when the government can o er ca- pacity subsidies is an artifact of the simpli ed economic environment we have studied to this point. The simpli ed environment involved so few frictions that the government can solve the moral-hazard problem and obtain the second best with a domestic or foreign rm. To detect nuances between the performance of domestic or foreign rms requires su\u000ecient frictions that the second best is not so easily attained. We have already seen this in the analysis restricting to linear-price contracts. With that friction, the domestic government was more inclined to sacri ce global e\u000eciency to extract rent from the rm with a foreign rm whose surplus the government does not internalize. We will obtain the same avor of a result in this section in a model introducing private information on the side of rms. The advantage of the approach here is more rigor, obtaining the looked-for results by suitably enriching the economic environment, not placing exogenous restrictions on contractual forms. The disadvantage is that the analysis is more complex, requiring the tools of mechanism-design. The disadvantage is mitigated by the 67fact that the ultimate results delivered by the mechanism-design tools are not any more complex than earlier ones. Instead of having a moral-hazard term distorting the investment thresholds, we will have an adverse-selection term that looks quite similar. As before, we will suppose unit capacity cost kis a random variable drawn from a distribution having pdf f(k) and logconcave cdf F(k) on support [0 ;K]. We now suppose that the draw of kis private observed by the integrated rm or by both UandDin model variants with unintegrated rms. The govern- ment moves rst, o ering a procurement contract. Appealing to the revelation principle, we will look for the optimal contract in the set of revelation contracts, which have rm announces its type ~kand receive the provisions speci ed in the initial contract o er for that announcement. As an analytical device, we will allow rich contractual provisions, perhaps unrealistically rich, but end up show- ing that a quite simple contract not varying along many of those dimensions is optimal, proving that we could have restricted contracts to that simple form without loss of generality. To that end, consider the following contractual provisions as functions of the rm's announced capacity cost: at-risk and not-at-risk capacity required to in- stallXr(~k) andXn(~k), output from those respective capacities Q1(~k) andQ2(~k), bonus price p1(~k) withint`periods after approval and sustained price p2(~k) af- terwards, and per-unit subsidies for at-risk and not-at-risk capacity \u001br(~k) and \u001bn(~k). Rather than solving for the optimal contract separately rst for an in- tegrated domestic rm and then for a foreign input supplier, we will dive right in to analyzing the latter case by including the variable for the foreign rm's bargaining share and note as before that setting = 0 nests the case of a fully domestic rm. Despite the richness of potential contracts, a simple mechanism attains the optimum, as the proof of the next proposition shows. The contract speci es two cuto s ^kand\u0016k. Fork < ^k, the contract requires the rm invest in su\u000ecient at-risk capacity to serve the whole population each period|and produces up to this capacity each period|in return for an up-front capacity subsidy of \u001br. Fork2(^k;\u0016k), the contract requires the rm to invest in su\u000ecient not-at-risk capacity to serve the whole population each period|and again produces up to this capacity each period|in return for an up-front capacity subsidy of \u001bn. Assume the investment and subsidy payment in the not-at-risk case are only made conditional on approval. The rm receives price of cper unit for all doses delivered for either investment form. The rather extensive proof, provided in the appendix, establishes that re- stricting the contract to this simple form is without loss of generality. Having done so, we can progress to deriving the optimal contract of this form. Let \u0019r(k) and\u0019n(k) denote, respectively, the rms' joint pro t from investing at risk and not at risk. Given the per-dose price equals c, satisfy incentive-compatibility constraints, ensuring types that are supposed to invest at risk do so instead of investing not at risk, and vice versa: \u0019r(k)\u0015\u0019n(k)8k2[0;^k] (A60) \u0019n(k)\u0015\u0019r(k)8k2(^k;\u0016k]: (A61) The contract must also satisfy earn nonnegative expected pro t: \u0019r(k)\u001508k2[0;^k] (A62) \u0019n(k)\u001508k2(^k;\u0016k]: (A63) As usual, incentive compatibility binds only for the more not less productive types, so we can ignore constraints (A61). Also as usual, individual rationality binds only for the less not more productive types, so we can ignore constraints (A62). In view of the pro t expressions in (A57){(A58), one can show that a necessary and su\u000ecient condition for the suite of constraints to hold is that they hold at the upper boundary: \u0019r(^k)\u0015\u0019n(^k) (A64) \u0019n(\u0016k)\u00150: (A65) These constraints bind at an optimum. Treating the constraints as equalities, substituting from (A57){(A58), and solving the system of equations for the capacity subsidies yields \u001br= (1\u0000s)^k+s\u0016k Substituting from (A66){(A67) into rearranging yields a new expression threshold between the types that invest at risk and not at risk. Taking the rst-order condition of (A68) with respect to ^k, rearranging, and the ^kidenote the optimal threshold between the types that invest not at risk and do not invest. Taking the rst-order condition of (A68) with respect to\u0016k, rearranging, and We sketched the following proposition. Besides providing more rigorous derivations, the formal proof, provided at the end of this appendix, veri es that the simple contractual forms we posited as optimal are indeed optimal when an unrestricted set of contracts is allowed. Proposition A5 The following is an optimal procurement mechanism for the domestic government under incomplete information. For k2[0;^ki], the rms (or rm) invest in su\u000ecient at-risk capacity to serve the whole population each period, produce up to available capacity each period, are paid a per-dose price cand a capacity subsidy \u001bi r= (1\u0000s)^ki+s\u0016ki. Fork2(^ki;\u0016ki], the rms (or rm) invest in su\u000ecient not-at-risk capacity to serve the whole population each period, produce up to available capacity each period, are paid a per-dose price c and a capacity subsidy \u001bi n=\u0016ki. It is straightforward to compare the thresholds under incomplete information for at-risk investment ^kiand for any investment \u0016kito their analogues in the second best, respectively, ^k\u0003\u0003and\u0016k\u0003\u0003, since they di er only by the last term in (A69) and (A70), which has an intuitive form. Incomplete information leads the government to distort the thresholds downward, involving less at-risk investment and less investment overall. The distortion is greater the greater the pro t share that leaks to the foreign rm and the greater the social cost of public funds \u0015. The distortion term is inversely proportional to the ratio f(k)=F(k) at the respective threshold, re ecting the relative likelihood of being near the threshold where the bene t of expanding the threshold is experienced versus being among the inframarginal rm types away from the threshold. An expanded threshold requires a greater capacity subsidy for the marginal type to break even, raising the rents earned by inframarginal types. Incomplete information is a friction on the optimal-contracting problem, and it causes a similar distortion to the amount of at-risk investment as restriction to a linear price caused in the complete-information setting. To see this, compare equation (A69) to (A56). 709.5 International Cooperation The formulas for the threshold ^kifor at-risk investment and the cuto \u0016kifor any investment suggest a clear role for international cooperation. When the input supplier is located in a foreign country, the domestic government o ering the vaccine procurement contract distorts the capacity subsidies downward to extract more rent from the rm, reducing the probability of at-risk investment relative to the second best as well as the probability of any investment relative to the second best. The domestic and foreign governments can cooperate to increase the subsidy for at-risk investment from \u001bi r= (1\u0000s)^ki+s\u0016kito (1\u0000s)^k\u0003\u0003+s\u0016k\u0003\u0003. They can increase the subsidy for not-at-risk investment from \u001bi n=\u0016kito\u0016k\u0003\u0003. This cooperative move would allow the countries to attain second best level of global surplus. Proof of Lemma A1 The maximization problem (A23){(A26) is a linear program for which the Kuhn- Tucker conditions are necessary and su\u000ecient for an optimum. Letting 1, 2, \u00161, choice variables, nonnegativity of the choice variables, and constraints (A24){(A26) themselves. The proof proceeds by analyzing an series of exhaustive and mutually exclu- sive cases. Case where the rst step follows from the de nition of \u0016k\u0003in (A27), the second step from (A75), the third step from \u0016\u0003 2= 0, and the last step from (A73). Hence, k\u0015\u0016k\u0003. The reader can verify that setting choice conditions and thus provide a solution. Cases (ii){(iv) Having provided a solution for k\u0015\u0016k\u0003, for the remainder of the proof suppose k<\u0016k\u0003. We step follows from (A75), the second step from (A77), and the third step from k<\u0016k\u0003, and the last step from (A27). But \u0016\u0003 2>0 together with (A83) implies Q\u0003 2= 1: (A92) We will use this fact in the analysis of the cases below. Case (ii) SupposeX\u0003 follows from X\u0003 n= 0, the second from (A81), and the third from (A92). We have shown X\u0003 r\u00141 whether \u0003 1>0 or from (A74), the second step from \u0016\u0003 1= 0, and the third step from r+X\u0003 nis pinned down in an optimum, not the two capacity tranches separately. We showed in the previous paragraph that X\u0003 r+X\u0003 n= 1. The optimum can be achieved by a linear combination of capacity tranches, includingX\u0003 r= 0 andX\u0003 n= 1, which does not involve at-risk investment. Summary Combining cases (i){(iv) together, we have shown that, across an exhaustive set of cases, the optimum can be attained by setting Q\u0003 1=X\u0003 r= 0 andQ\u0003 2=X\u0003 1 andX\u0003 n= 0. Q.E.D. Proof of Proposition A5 We will refer to a single integrated rm for brevity but the analysis also nests unintegrated rms and both domestic and foreign input supply. Consider a general contract specifying that the rm announces its capacity-cost type ~k. The contract requires the rm to install capacity Xr(~k) at risk and Xn(~k) not (A101) required to produce Q1(~k) withint`periods after approval and Q2(~k) in withint`periods after approval and sustained price p2(~k) afterwards. The rm is paid per-unit subsidies for not-at-risk capacity\u001br(~k) and\u001bn(~k), respectively. Let\u0019(k;~k) denote the rm's expected pro t from the contract when its type iskbut it announces ~k. We have \u0019(k;~k) =R(~k)\u0000X(~k)k; (A106) de ning expected to the rm R(~k) =\u001br(~k)Xr(~k) +s\u001bn(~k)Xn(~k) +s[p1(~k)\u0000c]Q1(~k)t`+s[p2(~k)\u0000c]Q2(~k)(te\u0000ta\u0000t`) investment is nontrivial, X(~k)>0, then either Xr(~k)>0 orXn(~k)>0. In that case, the government can deliver arbitrary revenue R(~k) to the rm via one or the other of the capacity subsidies \u001br(~k) or\u001bn(~k). Without loss of generality, prices can be set to production cost: p1(~k) =p2(~k) =c: (A109) The government designs the contract to maximize its expected surplus, which upon substituting from (A109) for the prices can \u0019(k;k)\u001508k\u00150: (A112) 74An increase in each of Q1(k) andQ2(k) increases the objective function while leaving constraints (A111){(A112) unchanged. To see this, note that Q1(~k) and Q2(~k) enter\u0019(k;~k) only through R(~k), which is independent of Q1(~k) andQ2(~k) when (A109) holds. Hence, we can take (A104) and (A105) to bind without loss of generality. Subsituting for Q1(k) andQ2(k) treating (A104){(A105) as equalities techniques that are standard in mechanism design, we can express R(k) in terms of Xr(k) andXn(k) to reduce the number of controlled functions. De \u0005( k) =\u0019(k;k). implies \u0005(k) implies \u00050(k) because it is optimal not to leave rents to the least productive type. Then R(k) = \u0005(k) Using integration by parts to evaluate the rst integral on the 0F(k)[Xr(k)+sXn(k)]dk+ZK 0[Xr(k)+sXn(k)]kf(k)dk: (A123) We can then use (A123) to substitute out for the term in R(k) in this objective function incorporates the information from constraints (A111){(A112). We will demonstrate this by maximizing (A124) ignoring those constraints and verifying at the end that the solution satis es them. Constraints (A111){(A112) are the only place where di erent realiza- tions of the random variable kare linked. Ignoring (A111){(A112) severes this linkage, allowing the problem to be maximized pointwise. The problem becomes one of nding Xr(k) andXn(k) maximizing the inte- grand in (A124) for each ksubject to (A99){(A101). This is a linear program in the choice variables, implying that the Kuhn-Tucker conditions are necessary and su\u000ecient for a maximum. multiplier on constraint (A101). The Kuhn-Tucker conditions include nonnegativity of the choice variables, and constraint (A101) itself. We have added superscript ito variables Xi r(k),Xi n(k), and isatisfying the Kuhn-Tucker conditions to distinguish the optimum in this model of incomplete information from optima in other settings. The proof proceeds by analyzing an series of exhaustive and mutually exclu- sive cases. Case (i) SupposeXi r(k) =Xi i= 0 by (A130). Substituting i= 0 into (A126){(A127), dividing by (1 + and of the values of ksatisfying (A132) with equality. The derivative of the right-hand side of (A132) with respect to kis 1 +\u0012 +\u0015 1 +\u0015\u0013\u0014f(k)2\u0000f0(k)F(k) f(k)2\u0015 : (A133) The second term is positive if and only if F(k) is logconcave. Since F(k) is logconcave by assumption, derivative (A133) is positive, implying that (A127) is satis ed for all k\u0015^ki. By (A18), (A131) is a weaker condition than (A132). Hence, (A131) is satis ed for all k\u0015^ki. Thusk\u0015^kiis su\u000ecient condition for solution n(k) = 0. By (A34), the ^kisatisfying (A132) with equality here is the is same ^kigiven in equation (A70) in the text. Case (ii) andXi (A128){(A129) both (A126) and (A127) must be satis ed with equality. Since both equal 0, the left-hand sides must be equal. Setting the left-hand sides of (A126) equal to the left-hand side of and rearranging yields s(te\u0000ta) =te\u0000ta\u0000t`; (A134) the values of ksatisfying (A138). The positive sign on the derivative (A133) implies that the left-hand side of (A138) is increasing ink. Hence, (A138) is satis ed for all k\u0014^ki. By (A35), the ^kisatisfying (A138) with equality here is the is same ^kigiven in equation (A69) in the text. Case (iv) SupposeXi r(k) = 0 andXi n(k)>0. By process of elimination, this solution is optimal for all k2(^ki;\u0016ki). Ignored Constraints Satis ed Combining cases (i){(iv) together gives the optimal contract in the statement of the proposition. As a nal step, we need to verify that this solution satis es ignored constraints (A111){(A112). Consider a rm with type k02[0;^ki] that invests at risk in equilibrium according to the optimal contract. The rm's expected pro t equals \u0005( k0) = (1\u0000s)^ki+s\u0016ki\u0000k0 in equilibrium. The rm earns the same expected pro t by deviating to any announcement ~k2[0;^ki], because the contractual provisions are the same for all types in that interval. If the rm deviates to announcement ~k2(^ki;\u0016ki], its expected pro t equals \u0019(k0;~k) =s(\u0016ki\u0000k0)\u0014\u0005(k0) for allk0\u0014^ki. If the rm deviates to ~k>\u0016ki, its expected pro t equals 0, which is strictly less than \u0005( k0) fork0\u0014^ki. Thus the incentive-compatibility constraint (A111) is satis for allk0\u0014^ki. We also just veri ed that individual-rationality constraint (A112) is satis ed for them as well. The reader can similarly verify that constraints (A111) and (A112) are satis ed for other types as well. Q.E.D. 78 "}
