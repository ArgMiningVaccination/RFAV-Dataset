HOWEY FRANKLIN - Wednesday's endorsement of Dan Coats by U.S. Rep. Mike Pence may have sealed up the Republican U.S. Senate nomination. Pence not only heads the House Republican Conference, but is extremely popular with Hoosier Repub- licans, having addressed the party's state dinner earlier this month to a rousing reception. He is also considered a favorite should he jump into the 2012 Indiana gubernatorial race, and many Hoosiers have urged him to seek the presidency in 2012. Pence talked with Coats shortly after Tuesday night's WFYI-TV debate. In a statement released mid-day Wednesday, Pence said, \"Dan Coats' integrity and conservative record make him the best candidate for the job. Dan is a proven conservative leader who is trusted by Hoosiers. I know Dan Coats well and I have long admired his personal faith, his devotion to family and his service to the people of Indiana.

HOWEY INDIANAPOLIS - When it comes to the Republican U.S. Senate race, Curt Smith has had vivid relationships /g90/g76/g87/g75/g3/g73/g82/g88/g85/g3/g82/g73/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g191/g89/g72/g3/g70/g68/g81/g71/g76/g71/g68/g87/g72/g86/g17/g3 He helped launch Richard Behney's campaign and he's worked with State Sen. Marlin Stutzman on marriage legislation with the Indiana Family Institute. He's also been Dan Coats' Senate state director and congress- man John Hostettler's chief of staff. As a reporter for the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette, Smith covered the environment received a gigantic endorsement from U.S. Rep. Mike Pence on Wednes- day, which gives him a tremendous boost toward the nomination. Coats is shown here with former congressman John Hostettler at the Franklin College debate on Monday.

He met Hostettler in 1994 at a Promise Keepers convention at the Hoosier Dome, then became his chief of staff in January 1995 after Hostet- tler had upset U.S. Rep. Frank McClos- key. He considers himself to be friends with both. But when it comes to the Senate primary, Smith is making it clear who he supports: Dan Coats. \"When Dan called me and said he was getting back in the race, I was very excited because I know a little bit about the Senate having worked there for six years,\" Smith told HPI. \"I know how senators interact with one another. I am thoroughly convinced that Dan Coats would be the best possible senator from Indiana. That's not to take anything away from John Hostettler. John is a smart guy. But the House of Representatives is whole- sale where groups and blocks come together to advance legislation. The Senate is retail. You've got to have Triple A people skills on legislation to get votes on your things. I just don't think John Hostettler is as well suited for the Senate as Dan Coats.\" The stories coming from former Hostettler staffers are similar. They describe long car rides with the congressman across the sprawling 8th CD where there was no conversa- tion. At times, Hostettler can become very introverted. He is described as an \"ideologue\" with an engineer mind- set. \"John's used to putting coal in there and getting electricity out of here and that's not always how the legislative process works,\" Smith said in describing the congressman who graduated from Rose-Hulman Insti- tute and his career at Vectren. \"A lot of times you need to bring the people skills in. You have to advance the con- versation.\" \"It's not only because Dan's been there before and served years in the Senate, it's just his people skills, his ability to reach out to folks, who can do something with someone as far to the left as Ted Kennedy and not compromise his principles and not give the store away,\" Smith explained. \"Usually in those days there was a pretty strong Democratic majority, as there is today. His conclusion was: this bill is going to move, I'm going to HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics /g60/g80/g93/g90/g91/g76/g73/g97/g20/g3/g41/g88/g90/g81/g84/g3/g26/g26/g20/g3/g26/g24/g25/g24 /g56/g73/g79/g77/g3/g27 make a bad bill better. He has the skills to negotiate with people who think differently; to blur the ideological lines and look for consensus.\" \"It's tough seeing John Hostettler having those kind of people skills,\" Smith continued. \"I think John has /g87/g75/g76/g86/g3/g81/g82/g87/g76/g82/g81/g3/g87/g75/g68/g87/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g54/g72/g81/g68/g87/g72/g3/g76/g86/g3/g90/g75/g72/g85/g72/g3/g92/g82/g88/g3/g74/g82/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g85/g72/g192/g72/g70/g87/g17/g3 Because you have a six-year term it's the longest horizon in government; it's not a delibera- /g87/g76/g89/g72/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g85/g72/g192/g72/g70/g87/g76/g89/g72/g3/g69/g82/g71/g92/g3/g68/g86/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3 Jimmy Stewart movies would suggest. The reality is the United States Senate is as reac- tive as the House, it just reacts differently. I just don't see John as the best suited candidate in there to get the job done for Indiana.\" The term \"ideological\" kind of has a negative connota- tion these days, Smith acknowl- edged. \"I would say that John is very idealistic,\" he continued. \"He is committed to and guided by a set of principles that are not that different from Dan's. The way they go about it is re- ally very different. John asserts them and wants to argue or use logic to get you to agree. Dan Coats will make the logical argument and establish the principles, but he knows that the art of persuasion includes a human dimension. Dan is going to connect with people.\" Asked for examples, Smith pointed to Coats' work to revamp the U.S. tax code in 1986 and his pioneer efforts on what he called the Project for American Renewal that eventually formed the structure for President George W. Bush's faith-based initiatives. Coats, Smith explained, began the \"notion that it's appropriate for a secular government to work with faith- based communities; that those communities are going to provide services and provide a special dimension for solving human problems. It was kind of a surprise to people in the late '80s and early '90s. He's really the author of President Bush's faith-based initiative. The senator's staff was the core of what Bush took into the campaign. The kernels and nuggets of that came from Dan.\" Smith remembers when Coats pressed President Reagan to double the dependent deduction from $1,000 to $2,000 during the last major Internal Revenue Service rewrite. \"Dan secured a promise from President Reagan in a meeting with House Republicans,\" Smith recalled. \"Dan almost single handedly was responsible for doubling the dependency exemption.\" As for Hostettler, Smith explained , \"I just see John as a guy who makes the case and then he says, 'You decide.' Sometimes you've got to do more than that. You have to stay with it, be passionate and make the message. It was hard to get him to return media calls. He did not want to do fundraising. He did not want to meet with some of the constituent groups who came in to see him and that's a tough thing to do.\" \"Now John could argue, 'Hey we're a re- public. You elect someone to make decisions for us.' /g60/g82/g88/g3/g70/g68/g81/g3/g191/g81/g71/g3/g87/g75/g68/g87/g3/g76/g81/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3 Federalist Papers and you can argue that, but that's not how people see their members of Congress today,\" Smith said. \"They want him to be respon- sive, to be receptive. They want the sense that they've been heard and are accessible.\" There's another element to Smith's perception that Coats would be the better Republican nominee, and that has to do with the 2006 election that Hostettler lost to U.S. Rep. Brad Ellsworth by 22 percent. HPI reported in October 2006 that Hostettler essentially gave up on that race, citing several high level Evansville Republicans who were told that by the congress- man. \"I chastised you about that,\" Smith said. \"I sent you an e-mail saying you were crazy.\" But in retrospect, Smith explained, \"I don't really know what happened in 2006. I do know that in politics you accumulate enemies and they don't go away. I just think over 12 years things kind of came home to roost in 2006. I did not see him as giving up. I saw him as being fatalistic about a lack of a memory in the public. He didn't have the passion to convince people about his positions. He made the case but I didn't see him /g191/g74/g75/g87/g76/g81/g74/g3/g68/g69/g82/g88/g87/g3/g87/g75/g68/g87/g3/g70/g68/g86/g72/g17/g180 But the 2006 loss, the biggest by an incumbent that year, is in Smith's mind Hostettler's greatest liability. \"The really tough question for John Hostettler to answer in his Senate campaign is, why should he be the one to carry the Republican Party's banner when he lost to Brad Ellsworth by 22 points?\" Smith said. \"That's a question for which I don't think John has a good answer.\" /g89 Curt Smith has worked for both Sen. Coats and Rep. Hostettler, but says that Coats is better suited for forging legislation in the Senate. (HPI Photo by Brian A.

Most observers saw Coats as the frontrunner, since he is the only candidate with statewide name ID, but he hasn't been on a ballot since 1992. However, he is well known in Republican women's clubs and other such organiza- tions around the state and with older voters most likely to turn out. At the Franklin College debate on Monday, the candidates acknowledged the youthful audience and were wistful. \"We haven't had much participation from young people,\" Coats lamented. But that could be to his advan- tage. He didn't raise the kind of money needed to fuel 3,000 to 4,000 gross rating points that would sew this thing up. Lost in all the \"loser\" commentary on Coats' FEC report is all the money pouring into the contested 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th CD primaries with 40 candidates all pressing the GOP donor base. Plus, a number of Republican donors will jump on the nominee's bandwagon. Coats needs only to be talking to likely Republican /g89/g82/g87/g72/g85/g86/g15/g3/g86/g82/g3/g75/g76/g86/g3/g72/g68/g85/g79/g92/g3/g179/g86/g87/g68/g87/g72/g90/g76/g71/g72/g3/g55/g57/g3/g69/g88/g92/g180/g3/g90/g68/g86/g3/g70/g82/g81/g191/g81/g72/g71/g3/g87/g82/g3 Fox News. But campaign sources told HPI that anyone who hasn't seen a Coats TV ad will, and \"will see it often\" in the coming hours. The endorsements from Pence - truly a national rising star - and Dr. James Dobson will help solidify support on both the macro and micro levels. The Pence endorsement will serve as a clarion call to Republicans in general. Coats is using the endorsement from Dobson to hit conservative talk and Christian radio, though it came after the initial radio buy. The Dobson endorsement only strengthened the impact of the ad. Dobson, the emeritus chair of Focus on the Family, explains, \"You may know my conviction that strong families are fundamental to a healthy society. It's also critically important for government to do no harm and to stay out of the way so that families can focus on what matters most. That's why, speaking as a private individual and not representing any organization, I urge you to vote for Dan Coats in the Indiana primary election on May 4th. I've always respected Senator Coats' commitment to families and I admire his determination to live out his Christian faith in public and private. I also appreciate his passionate defense of unborn babies. If /g80/g92/g3/g90/g76/g73/g72/g3/g54/g75/g76/g85/g79/g72/g92/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g44/g3/g90/g72/g85/g72/g3/g43/g82/g82/g86/g76/g72/g85/g86/g15/g3/g90/g72/g182/g71/g3/g71/g72/g191/g81/g76/g87/g72/g79/g92/g3/g89/g82/g87/g72/g3 for Dan Coats in the May 4th primary. Again, this is Jim Dobson asking you to join us in supporting strong families, limited government, lower taxes, and less spending by vot- ing for Dan Coats.\" In addition to the Pence and Dobson endorse- ments, the other candidates simply don't have enough name ID to get traction. And the window - from today through next Thursday - is rapidly closing as the broadcast environment begins to clutter up with the four congressio- nal district primaries and the various independent buys. John Hostettler has the evangelical network and his 8th CD base, but he was completely evasive about his FEC report, leading observers to conclude he raised the kind of money he used to in the Bloody 8th, which infuriated the /g49/g53/g38/g38/g17/g3/g58/g75/g72/g81/g3/g75/g72/g3/g86/g68/g76/g71/g3/g68/g87/g3/g41/g85/g68/g81/g78/g79/g76/g81/g3/g38/g82/g79/g79/g72/g74/g72/g3/g75/g72/g3/g90/g82/g88/g79/g71/g3/g191/g81/g76/g86/g75/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3 campaign with yard signs, bumper stickers and some radio, it sounded like a county commissioner campaign.

It had links to three videos that the campaign can't afford to use in broadcast or cable. Hostettler's networks with the Right to Life, 2nd Amendment, Tea Party and 9/12 groups should not be underestimated. His problem is that all that support is splintered. Indiana Right to Life, for instance, endorsed all /g191/g89/g72/g3/g83/g85/g76/g80/g68/g85/g92/g3/g70/g68/g81/g71/g76/g71/g68/g87/g72/g86/g17/g3/g55/g75/g72/g3/g55/g72/g68/g3/g51/g68/g85/g87/g92/g3/g89/g82/g87/g72/g3/g16/g3/g72/g86/g87/g76/g80/g68/g87/g72/g71/g3/g69/g92/g3 Hostettler and Susan Martin of a Valparaiso Tea Party cell to be about 20,000 based on movement e-mail lists - is expected to be split by Hosettler, Stutzman and Richard Behney. Hostettler was endorsed by the Liberty Caucus on Wednesday. \"He's not a perfect candidate, as he opposes a Balanced Budget Amendment and term limits, supports a closed border, and is too conservative on most hot-button social issues (but doesn't usually believe the federal gov- ernment should be involved),\" the caucus said on its web- /g86/g76/g87/g72/g17/g3/g179/g51/g72/g85/g75/g68/g83/g86/g3/g75/g76/g86/g3/g80/g82/g86/g87/g3/g86/g76/g74/g81/g76/g191/g70/g68/g81/g87/g3/g89/g82/g87/g72/g3/g90/g68/g86/g3/g75/g76/g86/g3/g21/g19/g19/g21/g3/g89/g82/g87/g72/g3 to oppose the War in Iraq. Hostettler favors the dissolution of the Department of Education, and voted against the No Child Left Behind Act because he believes education was a state matter. He also voted against most federal health care bills with the view that health care is a private or state matter. He maintains that many federal environmental laws and regulations infringed on individuals' property rights. He is active in promoting issues of freedom of religion and expression. He supported repeal of the estate tax, capital gains tax, and marriage tax penalty. Hostettler was recently endorsed by Congressman Ron Paul, and his supporters are having a MoneyBomb tomorrow.\" Stutzman and Bates Then there are Stutzman and Don Bates Jr., both with minuscule name ID. Stutzman seems to be everyone's second choice. By mid-week, he had secured the endorsement of the American Conservative Union and U.S. Sen. James DeMint. The South Carolina Republican said of Stutzman, \"Marlin Stutzman is the conservative outsider in the Indiana Sen- ate race who will take on the Washington establishment. Stutzman is exactly the kind of leader Americans are look- ing for this year. He's young, he's principled, and he's ready /g87/g82/g3/g87/g68/g78/g72/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g191/g74/g75/g87/g3/g87/g82/g3/g58/g68/g86/g75/g76/g81/g74/g87/g82/g81/g17/g3/g48/g68/g85/g79/g76/g81/g3/g54/g87/g88/g87/g93/g80/g68/g81/g3/g85/g72/g80/g76/g81/g71/g86/g3 me of Marco Rubio in Florida. He has the same passion, the /g86/g68/g80/g72/g3/g79/g82/g89/g72/g3/g73/g82/g85/g3/g75/g76/g86/g3/g70/g82/g88/g81/g87/g85/g92/g15/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g86/g68/g80/g72/g3/g70/g82/g88/g85/g68/g74/g72/g3/g87/g82/g3/g191/g74/g75/g87/g3 for it.\" Stutzman also began running a pretty good TV ad that moves from his LaGrange County farm to a graphic placing Coats and Hostettler in Washington. The ques- tion with Stutzman is, can he muster up enough money to hammer home the endorsements in this rapidly closing window? The Rasmussen Reports poll shows his postive/ negatives at a tiny 6 and 7 percent. Those are minuscule numbers that show he's not very famous.

Dan Coats, former U.S. Rep. John Hostet- tler and state Sen. Marlin Stutzman in the race for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate. The seat will be vacated by Sen. Evan Bayh, who has chosen not to seek reelection. Bates attacked the poli- cies of President Barack Obama, which partly /g76/g81/g192/g88/g72/g81/g70/g72/g71/g3/g75/g76/g80/g3/g87/g82/g3/g72/g81/g87/g72/g85/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g71/g72/g69/g68/g87/g72/g17 \"Barack Obama has launched an unprecedented assault on the American dream and for the past 13 months, I've been running to stop him,\" Bates said. Bates, and all the other candidates at the debate, vowed to repeal the health care reforms Obama signed into law last month. \"[Healthcare reform is] radical because it doesn't meet the needs that we're facing today, and that is an eco- nomic crisis that we need to address,\" he said. Among the other topics candidates took up in the debate were the current wars in the Middle East, balanc- ing the budget, the green energy sector and qualities they would look for in a Supreme Court nomination. The major challenge Bates said the Republican Par-ence, he has none and it's time for a fresh face and a fresh perspective in Washington. But Bates' problem is similar to Stutzman's: he lacks the money to pound the message home. And Bates' lone TV wasn't nearly as impressive as Stutzman's. Bates is mostly anonymous and it's hard to envision him breaking out. So we have the political volcano, with Pew Re- search pointing out that only 22 percent of Americans have much trust in their government. The Rasmussen Reports poll shows that only 28 percent of Hoosiers believe the health reforms will be good, and 58 percent say they will be bad. Some 65 percent favor repeal. Just 39 percent ap- prove of President Obama's job performance. But in the Franklin College/WFYI-TV debates, Coats' opponents did little to make a distinction and grab headlines. After both debates, the headlines were along the lines of \"GOP Senate Candidates Largely Agree on Issues.\" The upstarts missed their best opportunities to go on the attack and make a case for a new generation of leadership. And we have the ash cloud. We don't have a single credible snapshot of where this race stands. Inexplicably, /g53/g68/g86/g80/g88/g86/g86/g72/g81/g3/g53/g72/g83/g82/g85/g87/g86/g3/g71/g76/g71/g3/g75/g72/g68/g71/g16/g87/g82/g16/g75/g72/g68/g71/g86/g3/g90/g76/g87/g75/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g42/g50/g51/g3/g191/g72/g79/g71/g3 against U.S. Rep.

There were no head-to-head polls in the Repub- lican primary. That probably was the biggest element leading to a perception that no one had forged a consider- able lead. Given the general anger and the lack of other state primaries testing the anti-incumbency fervor, Indiana /g69/g72/g70/g82/g80/g72/g86/g3/g82/g81/g72/g3/g82/g73/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g191/g85/g86/g87/g3/g83/g72/g87/g85/g76/g3/g71/g76/g86/g75/g72/g86/g3/g82/g81/g3/g87/g75/g68/g87/g3/g73/g85/g82/g81/g87/g17/g3/g38/g82/g68/g87/g86/g3 is viewed as a virtual incumbent. A loss by Coats or U.S. Reps. Mark Souder (very unlikely) or Dan Burton (possible, but we have the race leaning his way) would lend con- siderable credibility to a potential throw all the bums out mentality. But with the GOP Senate race, that became in- creasingly unlikely on Wednesday. /g89 Don Bates Jr. greets Franklin College student panelists.

Richard Behney is best known for popu- larizing the Tea Party movement in Indiana, and he said that group still believes in the American free market system. \"It's not a Re- publican or a Democrat thing,\" said Behney. \"It's a freedom-loving thing. I feel like the [Republican] party has left me.\" Behney also blasted Democrat Barack Obama for keeping healthcare as a hot button issue while the nation was torn by a failing economy. He said that a drastic change in the recently passed bill was needed and that \"healthcare in America is not a right.\" He said that the American healthcare system was the best in the world, and many patients from foreign countries seek treatment here. As solutions, he suggested more competition and letting individual states deal with issues such as the cost of malpractice insurance for doctors that has driven costs up. However, there were some costs he would not reduce. If anyone out there deserved \"Cadillac healthcare,\" it is the families of men and women serving in the military, Behney said. Going on to attack the spiraling national debt, Beh- ney suggested that the government return to sound busi- ness practices such as those he has used to build a thriving plumbing business, the Atta Boy Plumbing Company. \"It's really a question of business 101 and common sense, which seems to be lacking greatly in D.C.,\" he said. /g3/g3 /g37/g72/g75/g81/g72/g92/g3/g86/g68/g76/g71/g3/g87/g75/g68/g87/g3/g191/g85/g86/g87/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g73/g82/g85/g72/g80/g82/g86/g87/g3/g36/g80/g72/g85/g76/g70/g68/g3/g80/g88/g86/g87/g3stop spending. He suggested that energy reform would be a good place to start saving money, and advocated less U.S. dependence on foreign oil and using the nation's ample coal and oil resources. While insisting America needs to defend its shores, he said that as a businessman, he favors befriending other countries and opening up the United States to more trade. During a question-and-answer portion of the debate, an activist from Lebanon, Ind., posed a question on family life regarding the importance of children hav- ing divorce-free extended families. Behney said this was a value of his but that he was against having federal intru- sion in people's lives. \"Hoosier families can take care of Hoosiers,\" he said. In his closing statement Behney concluded that the economic times were grim, but there was hope. /g3/g3 /g179/g58/g72/g3/g68/g85/g72/g3/g76/g81/g3/g89/g72/g85/g92/g3/g71/g76/g73/g191/g70/g88/g79/g87/g3/g87/g76/g80/g72/g86/g15/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g90/g72/g3/g68/g85/g72/g3/g76/g81/g3/g68/g3 deep hole.

John Hostettler did not intend to run for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, yet he found himself on the campaign trail debating with four other candidates at Franklin College Monday afternoon. Hostettler said he decided to run after the 2008 election. \"Our country is going in the wrong direction very fast, and we must do something in order to change that,\" Hostettler said. Hostettler said that he was discouraged by the direction his own party was going until he was invited to a Tea Party event. \"My discouragement melted away when I saw about 200 people show up in the middle of the day...that were there willing to take time out of their busy schedules and bring their children, in many cases, to talk about the issues,\" Hostettler said. When asked about the recent healthcare reform, Hostettler said that healthcare was legislated by a Congress which has \"gone beyond the constitutional boundaries set by the numerated powers and others in the U.S. Constitu- tion.\" Hostettler said that purchasing health care needs to expand across state lines along with the creation of tax credits for 100 percent of health insurance and cost, instead of the proposed health care reform. /g3/g3 /g43/g82/g86/g87/g72/g87/g87/g79/g72/g85/g3/g86/g68/g76/g71/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g7/g20/g17/g25/g3/g87/g85/g76/g79/g79/g76/g82/g81/g3/g71/g72/g191/g70/g76/g87/g3/g76/g86/g3/g68/g81/g3/g179/g82/g89/g72/g85/g16 arching issue,\" and the country is passing on to the next /g74/g72/g81/g72/g85/g68/g87/g76/g82/g81/g3/g68/g3/g179/g70/g85/g76/g83/g83/g79/g76/g81/g74/g3/g71/g72/g69/g87/g180/g3/g87/g75/g68/g87/g3/g90/g76/g79/g79/g3/g69/g72/g3/g71/g76/g73/g191/g70/g88/g79/g87/g3/g87/g82/g3/g82/g89/g72/g85 - come.

Stutzman said he was against government-run healthcare, and he would support repealing the bill. \"Is it even the federal government's responsibility to take over such a massive portion of our industry, heath care system, and our economy?\" he asked. \"I think they're focusing on the wrong issue to begin with.

He argued that the federal government has over- reached its boundaries on the healthcare bill. Another thing Stutzman would like to see changed is the amount of spending in Washington. \"One thing I've learned as a small business owner is that you can't spend more money than you take in, and you can't borrow more money than you can afford.

Republican candidates Todd Rokita and Brandt Her- shman seem to have pulled ahead in the polls, hoping to take the seat of Rep. Steve Buyer who will retire next year.

Horse Race Status: Leans Burton 5th District: Messer assails Burton ad As campaigns across Indiana ramp up advertising leading to May 4, a television advertisement promoting Dan Burton has caused a stir in the 5th District.

Burton spokesman John Donnelly said the ad was one of seven that have aired and was \"just to mix things up and get the same message out, but in a different way.\" Opponent Luke Messer, whose wife researched the commercial and discovered its out-of-state stars, said he understands that in some ways it may seem ridiculous to point out the commercial's shady background, but in other ways it's just sad. \"It really isn't a trivial matter. It's wrong to use paid actors, especially ones that aren't Hoosiers. Af- ter 28 years of leadership I wouldn't think you would have to pay someone to say nice things,\" Messer said. \"What this really does is highlight how detached (Burton) is from the district and how much he's become part of the Washington culture. If he thinks this is OK, he's been in Washington too long.\" Messer, however, is still running his initial bio ad.

Alas, no buses serve the residents of Jackson, Scott or Washington Coun- ties. And the government consolidation pundits claim that much of the government services business can now be handled on-line. But unlike the metropolitan areas where residents can have a choice of high speed internet (a necessity) to do business with government on-line) only portions of rural Indiana have the needed high speed inter- net connection.

Much more. No wonder the return of Census forms is slow, snail-paced in parts of Texas, where they take these threats more seriously than we sometimes do in Indiana. Beware, Indiana. FEMA concentration camps have been established at Indiana sites, at a faux rail repair yard at Indianapolis and in Fort Wayne and near LaPorte. For- eign troops are there already, training to guard American patriots who will be imprisoned in the New World Order take-over. And here you thought FEMA was just an agency created to bring misery to New Orleans hurricane survivors. Maybe Brownie really was doing a heck of a job, getting government priorities right, ignoring Katrina in order to concentrate on concentration camps. Internet warnings don't pinpoint a South Bend concentration camp. Aren't you suspicious, however, about all that construction around Notre Dame? Something called a nanotechnology center. Yeah, right. And an Innovation Park. Innovation for concentration? Did Barack Hussein Obama, he for whom there is no proof of birth, come to Notre Dame commencement last May to honor the graduates and Father Ted Hesburgh? Or, more likely, to plot with and honor the conspirators devel- oping a nanoconcentration camp? Beware. Even if no South Bend concentration camp is yet operational, law-abiding Americans from the area could be sent on a forced march on the Toll Road toward LaPorte or Fort Wayne, herded by foreign troops hired by the foreign operators of the Toll Road. Some of you will scoff at reports of concentra- tion camps. But as renowned a journalist as Glenn Beck conducted a fair and balanced investigation of their exis- tence and said: \"I can't debunk them.\" Later, under duress from critics of conspiracy truth, Beck did pull back from the claim. Luckily, he had already given widespread national publicity to the conspiracy. Raising conspiracy theories raises ratings. Raising conspiracy theories raises campaign funds. Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota raised bundles of campaign money by warning that the Census could be groundwork for concentration camps and declaring that she would not answer all the questions. Bachmann would not be intimidated by critics blabbering that she was encouraging people to violate the law. Beware. Don't let intimidation force you to answer. Not when targeting your address, with Census workers using GPS devices, is part of the reported plan to place unobtrusive colored dots on our mailboxes. Why? To help the foreign troops rounding us up. A blue dot means you're off to a FEMA concentration camp.

By CHRIS SAUTTER WASHINGTON - Dan Coats' campaign to reclaim his former U.S. Senate seat has been such a struggle you almost feel badly for him. What most observers assumed would be a slam-dunk primary election has turned into a slow bumpy ride. Is former Senator Dan Coats in danger of being denied the Republican nomination? I put that question to a prominent Republican friend from Fort Wayne, who told me there was absolutely no enthusiasm for Coats in what is the heart of his old congressional district. My friend - who supports the former Senator - predicts that Coats will win the primary, but adds somewhat ruefully that Coats' likely nomina- tion will give Democrats a real shot in November. Another Hoosier Republican told me Coats might even fail to carry his former congressional district in northeast Indiana. Marlin Stutzman, a state Senator from LaGrange County in the northeast section of his district, is giving Coats a run in his old home territory, though a Coats loss there seems unlikely. Why has Coats' campaign generated so little enthusiasm? There are several explanations, some more obvious than others. /g3 /g41/g76/g85/g86/g87/g15/g3/g38/g82/g68/g87/g86/g3/g75/g68/g86/g3/g68/g3/g83/g82/g82/g85/g3/g83/g85/g82/g191/g79/g72/g3/g76/g81/g3/g68/g3/g92/g72/g68/g85/g3/g90/g75/g72/g81/g3/g89/g82/g87 - ers are angry with establishment Washington.

Secondly, Coats' voting record has caused problems for him in the primary. His vote for the Brady bill and for /g87/g75/g72/g3/g70/g82/g81/g191/g85/g80/g68/g87/g76/g82/g81/g3/g82/g73/g3/g45/g88/g86/g87/g76/g70/g72/g3/g53/g88/g87/g75/g3/g37/g68/g71/g72/g85/g3/g42/g76/g81/g86/g69/g72/g85/g74/g15/g3/g76/g81/g3/g83/g68/g85/g87/g76/g70/g88 - lar, have created so much hostility that conservative blogs are boiling over with anti-Coats rhetoric. Third, Coats never developed a solid grassroots statewide base. He made his way up the ladder by hanging on to Dan Quayle's shirt. When Quayle beat Birch Bayh, Coats - an aide to the Congressman - succeeded him. When Quayle became Vice President, Coats was appointed Senator. He then defeated an underfunded Baron Hill and an over-ambitious Joe Hogsett. There has been an impres- sion among some that Dan Coats never quite earned the Senate seat, a feeling reinforced when he declined to run for re-election against the popular Evan Bayh. Finally, more than a few Hoosier Republicans re- sent that Washington insiders recruited Coats to run. There was never any clamor in Indiana that Dan Coats come back /g68/g81/g71/g3/g85/g72/g86/g70/g88/g72/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g53/g72/g83/g88/g69/g79/g76/g70/g68/g81/g3/g51/g68/g85/g87/g92/g3/g73/g85/g82/g80/g3/g68/g3/g90/g72/g68/g78/g3/g191/g72/g79/g71/g3/g82/g73/g3/g70/g68/g81/g71/g76 - dates. Even before Bayh bowed out-of-the-race, there was a sense of \"who needs him?\" among many Republi- cans. In fact, many Democrats are rooting for Coats be- cause the baggage that goes with being a lobbyist provides an easy target. In addition, the conservative Ellsworth could have an advantage over Coats with gun owners. Coats' lackluster fundraising is a clear sign of his rustiness as a candidate. His inability to keep pace with expectations in fundraising and his inability to generate excitement underscores a feeling among some that his time has passed. Even the Mike Pence endorsement could be inter- preted as a sign of Coats' weakness. The last thing Pence, /g90/g75/g82/g3/g75/g68/g86/g3/g71/g72/g86/g76/g74/g81/g86/g3/g82/g81/g3/g75/g76/g74/g75/g72/g85/g3/g82/g73/g191/g70/g72/g15/g3/g81/g72/g72/g71/g86/g3/g76/g86/g3/g87/g82/g3/g83/g88/g87/g3/g75/g76/g80/g86/g72/g79/g73/g3/g76/g81/g3 the middle of a primary battle at home. Why else would he weigh-in unless Coats needed the endorsement? Washing- ton Republicans pushed Pence to endorse Coats because they don't want to risk the chance of a John Hostettler nomination. That Coats is still likely to prevail on May 4 in spite of these obstacles speaks to the weakness of the /g53/g72/g83/g88/g69/g79/g76/g70/g68/g81/g3/g191/g72/g79/g71/g17/g3/g3/g43/g82/g86/g87/g72/g87/g87/g79/g72/g85/g3/g75/g68/g86/g3/g85/g68/g76/g86/g72/g71/g3/g68/g81/g3/g68/g81/g72/g80/g76/g70/g3/g7/g22/g26/g15/g19/g19/g19/g17/g3 Stutzman's statewide name recognition is so low and his fundraising so poor ($125,000 raised) he will literally have to bet the farm to run a competitive television campaign.

One wonders why he would relinquish the easy life to go back to the Senate, a place Evan Bayh is leaving because of the lack of civility and inability to accomplish important things. Coats says he was called back to service to help steer his country in the right direction. If the Senate is a different place from the one he left in 1998, the world of politics is a different world. But if he survives the volatility of the 2010 cam- paign, no one can say didn't earn it. /g89 HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics /g60/g80/g93/g90/g91/g76/g73/g97/g20/g3/g41/g88/g90/g81/g84/g3/g26/g26/g20/g3/g26/g24/g25/g24 /g56/g73/g79/g77/g3/g25/g28 Privatization is not a substitute for competence By MORTON J.

The road needed lots of moderniza- tion and massive expenditures were needed for highways throughout the state. The governor knew the legislature did not want to raise tolls or taxes for these legitimate purposes. So he got the money by leasing the toll road and letting the private operator raise the tolls. With that lease money Major Moves was established. Now our high- ways statewide are in better shape and the toll road has seen major im- provements. Tolls have increased only slightly (so far) and highway taxes have held steady. This success has provided an example for Indianapolis' mayor, Greg Ballard. He wants to avoid raising /g87/g68/g91/g72/g86/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g73/g72/g72/g86/g3/g87/g82/g3/g191/g91/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g70/g76/g87/g92/g182/g86/g3/g71/g72/g87/g72/g85/g76/g82/g85/g68/g87/g72/g71/g3/g90/g68/g87/g72/g85/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g86/g72/g90 - er systems by transferring ownership to Citizens Gas, the /g79/g82/g70/g68/g79/g3/g81/g82/g87/g16/g73/g82/g85/g16/g83/g85/g82/g191/g87/g3/g74/g68/g86/g3/g70/g82/g80/g83/g68/g81/g92/g17/g3/g43/g72/g3/g90/g68/g81/g87/g86/g3/g68/g79/g86/g82/g3/g87/g82/g3/g83/g85/g76/g89/g68/g87/g76/g93/g72/g3 the city parking meters.

But why would it be better to have Citizens gas run these functions? There are a few possible cost savings since gas, water and sewer lines run beneath the city streets. But Citizens has no special set of skills or knowledge to create /g80/g68/g77/g82/g85/g3/g72/g73/g191/g70/g76/g72/g81/g70/g76/g72/g86/g3/g76/g81/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g82/g83/g72/g85/g68/g87/g76/g82/g81/g3/g82/g73/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g90/g68/g87/g72/g85/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g86/g72/g90/g72/g85/g3 systems. What Citizens has is immunity from election when they raise rates. The parking meters and their rates are a minor part of an inadequate commitment to public transit in Indianapolis. Mayor Ballard does not tell the electorate that neither he has nor did his predecessors (Democrat and Republican) have a working transportation plan for Marion County, despite years of repetitive work by blue ribbon committees and distinguished commissions. Now the approach has become regional which guarantees more delay and more discord because there is no public will to proceed. Conseco Field House (like Lucas Oil Stadium) is a monument to the desire of Central Indiana to be taken se- riously, to have a place of prominence among the nation's metro areas. The Pacers want $15 million annually from the public sector to operate Conseco. Otherwise ... Farewell? Perhaps there could be a public subscription to Pacer stock. But that would not work.

The collapse taught us that the system was built on unsustainable leverage, irresponsible risk taking, /g86/g75/g82/g85/g87/g86/g76/g74/g75/g87/g72/g71/g3/g83/g85/g82/g191/g87/g3/g76/g81/g70/g72/g81/g87/g76/g89/g72/g86/g15/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g68/g3 lack of accountability. All involved, from the lenders, to borrowers, to those responsible for oversight bear some blame for the crisis. That's why it is absolutely essential for Congress to develop a comprehensive plan to modernize our overly complex and outdated regulatory system.\" Five Key Principles for Reform: 1) End Taxpayer Bailouts & Hold Wall Street Accountable: If a big bank or insti- tution fails, the federal government would break it up, sell off its assets to investors and companies and protect taxpayers by requiring Wall Street to pay the bill. 2) Eliminate Unfair and Deceptive Practices: Institute strong protections to prevent big banks who made billions selling investors a product they knew would fail and then bet on that failure. 3) Streamline Enforcement of Consumer Protec- tions: Consolidate consumer protec- tion agencies into a single regulator to /g80/g68/g78/g72/g3/g74/g82/g89/g72/g85/g81/g80/g72/g81/g87/g3/g80/g82/g85/g72/g3/g72/g73/g191/g70/g76/g72/g81/g87/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3 eliminate the ability of bad actors to hide between the cracks of a frac- tured regulatory system. 4) Increase Transparency for \"Shadow /g71/g72/g191/g81/g76/g87/g76/g82/g81/g3/g82/g73/g3/g68/g3/g69/g68/g81/g78/g3/g75/g68/g89/g72/g3/g68/g89/g82/g76/g71/g72/g71/g3 /g86/g70/g85/g88/g87/g76/g81/g92/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g79/g72/g71/g3/g88/g86/g3/g76/g81/g87/g82/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g191/g81/g68/g81/g70/g76/g68/g79/g3 crisis. Reform must bring transpar- ency to the unregulated and secretive derivative business and other shadow banking practices. 5) Protect Respon- sible Banks & Credit Unions: Ensure local community lenders aren't lumped in with the Wall Street banks.
