For those seeking Ayahuasca Retreats USA need to understand after years of stress, damage or substance abuse, along with poor nutrition, the brain's neural-pathways and neurotransmitters have suffered significant damage. This damage in the brain is one of the main reasons why individuals relapse, and requires significant healing to occur to return the person to a pre-addicted state. When people use benzodiazepines for an extended period of time, the GABA receptor becomes significantly saturated. Upon cessation of the medication they become anxious, irritable, depressed or a combination of the above due to the lack of GABA production. [The Holistic Sanctuary](https://www.theholisticsanctuary.com/) powerful proprietary IV formulas, promotes neurogenesis within the hippocampus creating stimulation and reproduction of natural GABA production. Basically the IV's will reset and repair the function of GABA and glutamate in the brain responsible for brain shocks and anxiety while coming off medication. READ MORE HERE [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4773875/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4773875/) It has been documented that the adult brain is capable of neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to repair itself through formulating new neurons. Our [Pouyan Method](https://www.theholisticsanctuary.com/) propriety IV formulas promote neuroplasticity by giving the brain all the vital peptides and amino acids for the brain, vitamins, minerals, micronutrients it needs to thrive and continue to heal itself from years of abuse. Through promoting neurogenesis, neuroplasticity and resetting neurotransmitters, the Pouyan Method IV drips will also create new neural pathways that are responsible for sending signals from one region of the brain to another. Ayahuasca Ceremonies can help by re-balancing the brain chemistry and enabling individuals to think clearly and put together logical thought patterns is a important element towards true healing. Without clearing the individual's mind they will continue to maintain a mindset which is convoluted and dominated by medications such as Prozac, Xanax, Suboxone, Methadone, Valium and many others. Once the brain is clear of toxic medications, able to function can retain information and has cognition, then it's a good time to teach a spiritual and healthy lifestyle change. This is time for the awakening of the soul and activation of the God molecule. Why Do People Seek Ayahuasca Ceremonies? People seek retreats that offer Ayahuasca Ceremonies more than ever before.

Ayahuasca Tea -Ayahuasca has been used in traditional medicine and in Amazonian Shaman practices for centuries. The ancient tea is prepared and extracted known as the \"God Molecule\" dimethyltryptamine, aka DMT. Ayahuasca is used for its healing properties and sometimes used to explore dreams, inner thoughts, fears, hopes and spiritual guidance. What Does It Feel Like While You Are On Ayahuasca- Ayahuasca Ceremonies is known to give its users strong and intense audio and visual hallucinations. Ayahuasca is a word derived from Quechua meaning the \"vine of the soul\". It is known to cure many different illnesses: cancer, depression, anxiety and drug addictions. It is non-addictive and a safe digestible remedy. Traditional Ayahuasca Retreat Theory- It is believed by the locals that grew up around this potent healing remedy that the plants used to concoct it retain the capability to release their spirits to guide them through invigoration. Through the use of this remedy people believe they can gain clarity from their own self-destruction from other-world spirits. People who undergo these experiences believe to have gained the ability to conquer their hardships, as well as a new found self-worth. Ayahuasca Treatment Effects -The Ayahuasca experience can last from 3-6 hours after consuming the powerful brew. This is all determined by the potency and amount taken. Typical symptoms after consumption are as follows: Optical and hearing hallucinations. The potency of the concoction will determine how intense the experience will be. Illusions that stem from the medicine are surreal and emotional. Ayahuasca Retreat with our Shamans will guide an individual through these emotional states, to face and conquer their trauma that's stuck in the subconscious mind. Individuals who have already gone through the experience encourage first time users to undergo the trials and to face their realities as a key part of the ayahuasca retreat. Only then will the individual achieve true clarity and be rid of physical and psychological ailments. Traditional Ayahuasca Retreats Centers - Experienced Shamans and their assistants provide guidance through a traditional Ayahuasca Ceremony USA or in South America. Users are expected to refrain from certain activities such as sex, certain foods before and after undergoing the experience. While under the effects of this potent remedy the Shaman will use totems, music, rituals, chanting and other ceremonial tools to guide and protect them. Ayahuasca Mental Health or Addiction Remedy - People looking for an alternative addiction remedy have turned to Ayahuasca Retreats for its ability to change thought patterns, they hope that the intense experience will help them conquer their psychological hurdles. Users that have overcome their PTSD, Depression and Addiction, praise it for ridding them of cocaine, meth, pills, and alcohol abuse. Ayahuasca Retreat Centers that provide this healing treatment have prerequisites before undergoing treatment, patients are to undergo a psychological and psychic detoxification and healing sessions that may last many months. Ayahuasca Alternative Approach- When Ayahuasca is used as an alternative for mental health and addiction option, it fits into the domain of Psychedelic Therapy. This type of regimen enables the user to help identify the root of their mental health issue and emotional pain. It allows one to explore and deal with unpleasant memories, or feelings in a non-compromising manner that decreases uneasiness and anxieties. Ayahuasca Reconnect to the Soul- This consciousness-changing drug is used to assist the healing aspect of substance abuse since the remedy is not a symptom-driven approach, the results are long lasting. The objective is to conquer the burdens, obstacles and self-destructive tendencies that came with substance abuse. Ultimately helping one find their self-worth, allowing them to reconnect with friends, family, other loved ones, and most of all reconnect to the soul. Different Types of Ayahuasca Retreats USA The Choice is Yours When you're seeking the truth on a deep level as what happens with Ayahuasca, you can find the truth in a number of places that offer this plant teacher medicine. Many of them are located in the Amazon jungle. This would be an adventurous trip and one that is life-transforming but there may be things you may not realize before you go: - You have to be physically able to walk for a long time - sometimes about an hour - to get to the destination as they are quite remote. - Along the way, you may be faced with high humidity, poisonous spiders, humongous insects and deadly snakes. - Your visit for the 7 - 14 days often doesn't have any modern day amenities like clean water or basic toilets, and often the accommodations may be a tent or a hut on stilts that involves climbing up and down. - If you need any type of medical attention, it could be hours before you are transported to an appropriate medical facility, usually on a moped or bicycle w/engine. There is a \"Safe Ayahuasca Retreat\", a total alternative to random underground Aya centers.

How To Prepare for an Ayahuasca Ceremony in the Safest Way Once the brain has been reset and healed from medication dependency, we start the pretreatment and Ayahuasca prep. Along with brain repair IV drips, we have figured out that accessing parts of the brain we can't access is crucial. The human brain can only be accessed roughly 5%, but with this approach we believe we can access much more of it. We have witnessed miraculous transformations with patients that are treatment resistant to standard western medicine and prescription drugs. These plants are known to expand spiritual consciousness, the reconnection to the soul, the awakening of the inner core of the human being. But these sacred plant medicines must be done correctly, they cannot be done by fly by night wanna be shamans or anyone.

PROVEN RESULTS FROM OUR AYAHUASCA CEREMONIES Before & After Before & After Luxury Ayahuasca Ceremonies for Depression, PTSD Healing Center [Ayahuasca](https://www.theholisticsanctuary.com/treatment-centers/ayahuasca-retreat/california/), pronounced \"iowaska,\" is a sacred vine that is native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. Its name means \"vine of the soul,\" and it has been used for hundreds of years by the Indigenous peoples of Amazonia in healing ceremonies. The plant's bark is typically brewed with the Banisteriopsis caapi line and leaves from the Chacruna plant to create a powerful healing tea, which also goes by the name Ayahuasca. We have used it for almost 10 years to help cure our patients from drug addiction, alcoholism, depression and much more. Everyone knows Ayahuasca drug rehabs can't offer a 100% cure, but since it is common knowledge its not a panacea, we decided to perfect the cure for most if not all addictions by adding it to our Pouyan Method. Our Ayahuasca Retreats USA Can Help Cure Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Other Mental Illnesses Ayahuasca Ceremonies can cure post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental illness as it can cause powerful psychological effects to the user. Some call it a drug while others consider it a medicine. For many veterans who have tried and tested Ayahuasca, they considered it as a real treatment for giving them relief from PTSD after returning from combat. It does not work like a band-aid. Rather, it cleans the user's system by purging it until he/she is thoroughly reset and clean. Its spiritual effects make this treatment a popular alternative to the traditional method of treating mental illnesses. In fact, Lindsay Lohan has spoken about her treatment with Ayahuasca. She said that it opened her eyes about the things of the past that she did not want to let go. Ayahuasca Retreats Must Do The Following If They Want To Maximize Results with PTSD, Depression, Trauma and Medication Use and Abuse First off, this is not cheap, The Ayahuasca Ceremony we deploy at [The Holistic Sanctuary](https://www.theholisticsanctuary.com/) are very pricey. Example the HBOT machines we have are cost $300 per hour and the NAD IV drips are $1000 per day per patient.

Also we offers the most powerful proprietary IV formulas that can repair the damaged brain's ability and capacity to create neural pathways and neurotransmitters, thus promoting neurogenesis within the hippocampus. Its extremely effective at healing the nervous system and endocrine system because its creating stimulation and reproduction of natural Dopamine Serotonin and GABA production within the brain.

[SEE TESTIMONIALS CLICK HERE. ](/video-testimonials/) We use a variety of therapies like HBOT, Amino drips, Massage, Reiki, Yoga. Why Almost 100% of Our Patients Have Visions During Ayahuasca Ceremonies. It's pretty simple to explain why close to 100% of our guest have visions and 40% -/+ other places have people complain they saw no visions? We have the only Iv drip in the world that repairs and decalcifies the pineal gland, yes you heard correctly, the only Ayahuasca Retreat Center in the world with such IV drips. We invented it, we created it, perfected it, it's ours and you will not find it at any Rehab or Treatment Center or Ayahuasca Retreat. And we, meaning the Inventor of the Pouyan Method The Holistic Healer in charge \" [Johnny Tabaie\"](https://www.theholisticsanctuary.com/about-us/meet-johnny-tabaie/). At least 50% of clients prior to enrollment into The Holistic Sanctuary complain of lack of sleep this is due to the GABA receptor saturation. When the Gaba receptors become damaged, it becomes significantly impossibly to function and less sleep. So due to the lack of GABA production the brain cannot shut itself off. Basically the Pouyan Method IV's will reset and repair the function of GABA and glutamate in the brain responsible for brain shocks and anxiety while coming off medication. Johnny Tabaie saw this problem for many years and decided to take the task on and spearheaded it, like he does everything in the company. Most if not all adult brain are capable of neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to repair itself through formulating new neurons. The Brain Repair Pouyan Method propriety IV formulas promote \"natural\" neuroplasticity by giving the brain all the vital amino acids for the brain, vitamins, minerals, micronutrients it needs to thrive and continue to heal itself from years of abuse. Through promoting neurogenesis, neuroplasticity and resetting neurotransmitters, the Pouyan Method IV drips will also create new neural pathways that are responsible for sending signals from one region of the brain to another. Ayahuasca Retreats - Luxury or not, Should always Use Safety First It is vital that we only organically heal and balance the brain to help and enable the individual's ability to feel, function, and to think clearly. This will allow the patient to put together cohesive thought patterns which is a massive element towards true healing. Without clearing the individual's mind they will continue to maintain a mindset which is convoluted and they will be dominated and rely on medications such as Lexapro, Prozac, Xanax, Suboxone, Methadone, Valium and many others. However, Once the brain is healed, reset, and clear of all toxic medications, and he or she is able to function and can retain information, then it's a good time to teach a spiritual and healthy lifestyle change. This is time for the awakening of the soul and activation of the God molecule with an Ayahuasca Ceremony.
