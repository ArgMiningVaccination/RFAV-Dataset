Vaccine Efcacy Against Omicron Variant INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ( 1). Since the rst reported case in December 2019, in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread through China and many other countries worldwide in a short period of time ( 2). The COVID- 19 pandemic has changed the lives of billions of people all over the world and has signicantly weakened the global economy. Approximately 400 million people worldwide have been infected by this virus, resulting in around 6 million deaths (3). Consequently, there is an urgent need and of great importance to prevent COVID-19 infections with the implementationofasafeandeectivevaccinationprogram. Internationalresearchesproceededatanunprecedentedspeed in the pursuit of an eective and safe vaccine against COVID- 19. In this regards, a variety of dierent types of vaccines is currentlybeingadministeredtopeopleofvariousagesallaro und the world ( 4,5). It is commonly recognized that the mRNA vaccineisthemosteectivetypeofvaccine,followedbythevir al vectorvaccinesandinactivatedvirusvaccines( 6,7).Nonetheless, all vaccines are eective tools in preventing severe COVID-19 symptoms,hospitalization,anddeath( 4). COVID-19 has become increasingly virulent due to the emergence of variants ( 8,9). Recently, a new variant of SARS- CoV-2 was reported from South Africa. On November 26th, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated this mutant as a variant of concern\u2014Omicron (line B.1.1.529) ( 10). TheB.1.1.529Omicronvarianthasenhancedtransmissibili tyand immune evasion, and has been observed in over 77 countries (11). This raises a concern regarding the ecacy of existing COVID-19 vaccines against the Omicron variant ( 12), and also stimulates the debate for a booster vaccine ( 13). Our study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the eectiveness of the existing COVID-19 vaccines and whether the booster provides additional protection against the B.1.1.529 Omicro n variant. Clinically, our ndings will help to develop vacci nation strategiesagainsttheOmicronvariant. METHODS Study Design That Contains Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Human studies were included and studies with specically targetedparticipants(e.g.,patientswithseveresystemicdi seases, patients with prolonged antibiotic therapy, pregnant women, cancer patients, frontline workers, nursing home employees) were excluded. Studies focused on the eectiveness of COVID- 19 vaccines against the Omicron variant, and the eectivenes s on vaccinated participants vs. unvaccinated participants were included. No restrictions were applied to the age of participant s, thetypesofvaccination,orthenumberofparticipants. Search Strategy A comprehensive search was conducted for academic research studies that reported the eectiveness of COVID- 19 vaccines against the B.1.1.529 Omicron variant published FIGURE 1 | Steps of the study selection procedures. from inception to June 5th, 2022 by searching the following electronic bibliographic databases: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The following search terms were used: (\"Covid19 variant\" OR \"Elasomeran\" OR \"TAK-919\" OR \"M-1273\"). Data Collection and Analysis Two independent investigators (Y.Z., D.H.) assessed the art icles and extracted data according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These two independent investigators (Y.Z., D.H.) also assessed the methodological quality of the trials included in this review. A Microsoft Excel database was created to record all available information, including vaccine type, doses, a nd vaccination rate in infection and control groups.

The Newcastle- Ottawa assessment scale was used to assess the quality ofevidence. Statistical Analysis Stata version 16.0 (Stata corp., college station, TX, USA) was used to perform the meta-analyses. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% condence intervals (CI) were calculated by the random- eects model to accommodate heterogeneity across studies. HeterogeneitywasassessedbyI2statistics. RESULTS Description of Included Studies Thesearchofdatabasesyielded6,413results,ofwhich13st udies (12,14-25) met the criteria and were included in this study. Andrews et al. ( 26) also reported eectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Omicron variant in 2021, but the includ ed cases could be reported in his another article published in 202 2 according to the timetable and the inclusion criteria. Figure1 shows the detail selection procedures to identify the includ ed studies. Among them, ve included studies have low risk of bias and eight have high risk of bias ( SupplementaryTable1 ). The included studies had a total sample of around one hundred million (N =148260342) participants and of these, 74.2% werefully vaccinated ( n=110076947) with at least two-doses of COVID-19 vaccines ( Table1). Among the 13 studies, 1 study reported the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines ( 24); 3 reported BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and mRNA-1273 vaccines ( 12,21,22); studies of the BNT162b2, and mRNA-1273 vaccines ( 14,16,17,20,23); 2 reported the eectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine (18,19),and1studyreportedtheeectivenessofthemRNA-1273 vaccine(15). Effectiveness of the COVID-19 Vaccines Against the Omicron Variant To evaluate the protective role of COVID-19 vaccination, we rst compare fully vaccinated (at least two standard doses) an d unvaccinated populations. Figure2A shows the eectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines against the Omicron variant after at least two doses of the vaccination. All ( 12,14-23,25) but one study (24) showed that vaccines played a signicant role in reducing the risk of B.1.1.529 Omicron variant infection am ong the fully vaccinated population (two doses with or without boosters),comparedtotheunvaccinatedpopulation.Thepoolin g of 13 studies showed that no signicant dierence between ful ly Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 940956Zou et al.

After excluding the one study ( 24) looking at the long term eectiveness of the vaccinated population, the pooling of the remaining 12 studies showed that full vaccinat ion signicantly lowered the of infectionagainsttheOmicronvariant( Figure2B ). This data prompted us to examine the eectiveness of the booster vaccination. The eectiveness of the standard two- dose vaccination plus one booster (total three doses) agains t the Omicron variant is shown in Figure3. The pooling of 11 studies showed that two-dose vaccination plus booster signicantly lowered the risk (OR =0.44, 95% CI: 0.37-0.51; I2=99.7%,p<0.001) of infection against the Omicron variant compared to the unvaccinated group ( Figure3). The pooling of these same studies also showed that the standard two-dose vaccination plus a booster signicantly lowered th e risk (OR =0.60, 95% CI: 0.52-0.68) of infection against the Omicron variant compared to the two-dose vaccination without booster ( Figure4), with a signicant heterogeneity =99.8%,p<0.001). Collectively, these analyses reveal that full vaccinationbuildsaprotectiveeectagainsttheOmicronvar iant, and booster vaccines provide additional protection against t he Omicronvariant. SincemRNAvaccineswerecommonlyrecognizedasthemost eective vaccines ( 6,7), we then studied the of mRNAvaccines against lowere d the risk of infection against the Omicron variant compared to no vaccination( Figure5). In summary, our data clearly indicated the eectiveness of vaccination and the promoter role of booster vaccination against the Omicron variant. The results also conrmed the eectiveness of the mRNA vaccines in preventing the Omicron variantinfections. DISCUSSION The recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has attracted worldwide attention and became a global concern (11).AmongthedierentvariantsofSARS-CoV-2,theOmicron variant has a remarkably increased transmissibility ( 27,28). It is also dicult to evaluate the eectiveness of the currently available COVID19 vaccines against the Omicron variant in the absence of strong data ( 29). Besides, there are a lot of debates about the necessity of the boosters, and the new emerging Omicron variant with the signicantly increased transmissibility supercharges the debates ( 13). The goal of this Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 940956Zou et al. Vaccine Efcacy Against Omicron Variant FIGURE 4 | Effectiveness of the three doses COVID-19 vaccines against t he Omicron variant compared to the two doses only vaccinatio n. study is to investigate the roles of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing the Omicron variant infections. The results show ed the eectiveness of full vaccination against the Omicron var iant was signicantly but waned over time. The booster dose could induce higher levels of eectiveness compared to the standard two-dosevaccination,whichmayberelatedtotheshorterle ngth of time between the last dose and the study data collection since the vaccination eectiveness wanes over time. These ndings will facilitate vaccination strategies and help de velop boosterschedules. Fullvaccinationwiththecurrentlyavailablevaccinesprov ides a (OR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.56-0.69) within a period of time, but it is not as eective as it is against the Delta variant (RR=0.15, 95% CI: 0.07-0.31) ( 30). The Omicron (OR =0.44, 95% CI: 0.37-0.51); however, it is also less eective compared to the reported protection eectiveness against Delta (OR =0.065, 95% CI: 0.059-0.071) ( 16). It is expected that new variants will continue to emerge as viruses mutates. Although the eectiveness of the currently available vaccin es against new variants may decrease, vaccination still provid es protection against severe COVID-19 caused by dierent variants ( 31,32) and may also decrease the emergence of newvariants.While Omicron has been less virulent than the Alpha and Delta variants, which was likely related to higher vaccinati on rates and thus reduced disease severity ( 33), it has still caused tremendous morbidity and mortality ( 14). In the absence of an Omicron variant-specic vaccines, the current ly existing vaccines remain the best option to reduce infection and disease severity against the currently circulating SARS - CoV-2 Omicron variant. The booster is also recommended given the increased transmissibility of the Omicron varian t and reduced protective eectiveness of the standard two- dose vaccination compared to the three-dose vaccination with booster, especially for the high-risk populations. Additionall y, those who received the two-dose vaccination plus booster were also reported to have fewer hospitalizations and lower disease severity compared to the unvaccinated population (14,15). Several COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, mRNA- 1273,andJNJ-78436735)wereincludedinthisanalysissincet he availability of dierent types of vaccinations were varied ac ross the world. Dierent vaccines may have various protective eects againCOVID-19variants.Anadditionalanalysiswasperform ed to assess the eectiveness of mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273), which are recognized as the most eective ( 6, 7) against the Omicron variant. Although the results showed both the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines signicantly Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 940956Zou et al. Vaccine Efcacy Against Omicron Variant FIGURE 5 | Effectiveness of fully mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-12 73) against the Omicron variant compared to the unvaccinati on. lowered the risk of infection against the Omicron variant, interpretation of the results must consider the small number of included studies (3 for mRNA-1273 and 4 for BNT162b2). These studies did not evaluate the time between the second or third vaccinated doses and symptom onset, which might influence the results as the vaccine eectiveness decreased w ith time(15). In this analysis, the eectiveness of the vector vaccine (ChAdOx1) was reported by in ve studies ( 12,21,22,24,25). The pooled eectiveness of the vector vaccine was unable to be evaluated as most of these studies did not report the eectiveness of each vaccine individually. The ChAdOx1 vector vaccine followed by boosting with a mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) is currently recommended in Germany. This vaccination strategy is reported to induce higher or comparable humoral and cellular immune responses than homologous mRNA vaccines ( 34). More studies are needed in the future to assess the eectiveness of a specic vaccine and vaccination strategy. Moreover, the misclassication of disease status could be a potential source of bias. Several studies ( 12,15,18,21,22,25) used highly specic and sensitive PT-PCR tests, which minimizedmisclassication and is recommended for future studies in thiseld. Except for the vaccinated doses, type and time, the intrinsic host factors (age, sex, genetics, comorbidities and so on), and extrinsic factors (preexisting immunity, microbiota, infe ctions, antibiotics and humoral and cellular vaccineresponsesinhumans( 35).Besides,vaccineadjuvantand administrationfactors(schedule,site,route,andcoadmi nistered vaccines and other drugs) are also influential ( 35). Additional research will provide more information about these factors to helpcreateeectivevaccinationstrategies.
