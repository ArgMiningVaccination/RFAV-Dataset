Sometimes our energy can become blocked or out of balance due to stress, anxiety or other external triggers impacting our internal wellbeing such as loss, conflict, or fear. This can cause us to feel irritable, drained, hyper, shut down or even cause illness in the body. Our Private Energy Healers can help to identify the area(s) in the body where you're feeling the blockage/impact and can work to restore energy flow, nervous system restoration, and help with deeper relaxation, stress reduction, and overall balance. Energy Practitioners Laurie Markowitz, E-RYT 500, began connecting with energy as a young child through meditation. She reconnected again during iRest Yoga Nidra training in 2013 and soon after pursued her Reiki 1 and Reiki 2 Certifications before opening Balancing Owl Yoga in 2016. Throughout her training, she was able to further explore the emotional balance that energy healing brought to her own life and those around her. Laurie shares energy healing in all yoga classes and also works with family, pets and friends. During a session with Laurie, she will begin with a conversation to help connect and gain an understanding of your needs. She will then assess where your energy may be blocked and help to restore movement and flow. Janis Whipple earned her Master/Teacher Reiki certification and has been practicing Reiki for many years. She loves blending the Reiki gift of healing, stress relief, and relaxation. Janis' favorite quote is \"nature does not require that we be perfect, it requires that we grow\". (Liebman). A certified personal fitness trainer through the American Council on Exercise since 1995, Janis has made it her mission to guide others to find optimum health through personalized programs. Janis also very passionate about teaching Nia technique classes at the studio, a mind, body, spirit practice that teaches us each to move our own body's way. Melinda VanKirk is a Reiki Master/Teacher trained in the traditional Japanese form of Usui Shiki Ryoho Reiki (rather than the more common Western or Modern version). She began her Reiki training in 2020, where her first Reiki class changed her entire perspective on how we exist as spiritual and energetic beings. After that class, she began to dive deep into the healing powers of Reiki - completing her Reiki Master training and apprenticeship in just two years. Melinda's style of energy healing is very intuitive, and focuses on releasing energy blockages, rebalancing the chakras, and releasing energetic attachments. As an empath and energy healer, she guides those seeking alternative and holistic healing to prioritize their wellbeing through Self-love and self-care.
