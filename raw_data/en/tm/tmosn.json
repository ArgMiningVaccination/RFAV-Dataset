Care facility allegations unfounded,say oHicials By TOM DRURY Staff Wnter - Charges of resident abuse and staff harassment at the Johnson County care Facility for retarded and emotionally disturbed persons are unfounded, county officials have reportedly been told by the chainnan of the County care Review Board. However, two facillty employees say the board, investigating the recent allegations made against facility co\u00ad administrators Richard and Doris Kelley, has not yet done an adequate job. \"I don't have any evidence of anybody looking into the problem. Nobody has called me,\" facility recreation director LInda Harrold said Wednesday. Harrold, facility ward attendant Kathy Peck, and fanner head nurse Betty Ockenfels all made specific charges against the Kelleys at a Review Board meeting Oct. 2l. Since then, the board has not talked to any of them. But board Chalnnan Joe Kauffman has told the chairwomen of the County Board of Supervisors, Loreda Cilek and Doris Kelley, on separate occasions, that the board' has found \"nothing wrong\" at the facillty, according to CiJek. Reached Thursday evening, Kauff\u00ad man would not comment on whether he made such a statement. Peck, Ockenfels, and Harrold stand by their previous charges, including: -The facility went for two days without attendants on the men's ward over Labor Day Weekend (Harrold). -Two residents have worked at the Kelleys' private home in Montezuma (Peck). -A woman was dragged, on Doris Kelley's order, to a tuberculosis test she didn't have to take (Peck). -Residents have been harassed into signing documents (Ockenfels). Harrold and Peck both feel the charges are not receiving sufficient Investigation. \"It seems they should have contacted somebody by now. I'd be more than willing to talk to board members,\" Harrold said. \"It doesn't seem like they're interested. \"I think they're just trying to let it die down,\" she continued. \"The care Review Board should meet personally with the people (making the charges). I had expected to at least hear from them over the phone, but they haven't done that either.\" Peck, also contacted Wednesday, doubts the worth of the Review Board's investigation. \"I don't see how the investigation can be probing into them (the charges) very far If they're not going to be asking anyone about them,\" she said. \"I don't. know what they are doing. If they're just sitting there and not doing anything, that's not right. \"I don't know what to think of the investigators anymore,\" she said. Referring to the turnout of citizens, reSidents, and employees at the Oct. 21 meeting, she added, \"Obviously more people than just us are discouraged.\" Peck said facillty conditions could improve if facillty employees elect to join the Staff Employees Collective Organization (SECO). The union election, to be held today, was made possible by a State Public Employees Relations Board (PERB) decision that facillty employees are a separate collective barRaining unit. , Winter forecast: lots-of snow By KELLY ROBERTS Writer .. Editor', note: Thia ja part one of/our on the coming winter and how to live through it. \"If you want an idea of what this winter is going to be like, my snow tires are on and there is a shovel in my car.\" Paul Waite, Iowa's state cUmatologist, said this winter will be \"decidedly dif\u00ad ferent from last winter.\" His long range prediction calls for more snow, but higher temperatures, although they will still be below nonnal. \"It will be cold, but the cold periods will be shorter, not as persistent as they were last year,\" he said. Waite's prediction calls for between 30 and 40 inches of snow this year, with more falling in the north and less in the south. Iowa City should receive about 35 Inches. This total would be a large Increase over the two previous winters. The state average snowfall last winter was 21.1 inches and In the winter of 197f1..'76 the state received an average of 18.3 Inches. The annual long tenn average is 32.4 inches. \"There will be a few good stonns this winter,\" he said. \"There is also a possibility of a blizzard and perhaps some ice stonns. One other thing we'll see this year that we didn't last year is winter fog. \"These conditions will all combine to make this winter a hazardous one for motorists,\" he said. Jack Percival, an assistant main\u00ad tenance engineer with the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT), said the state will spend about $10 mUllon to clear the streets of snow this year, If this is a nonnal winter. Last year, when there was little snow, the state paid only $U million, but three years ago, when the snowfall was heavier, the cost was $13.8 mUllon. The DOT's fleet of 1,025 snow-equipped trucks and 1,800 employees are called out an average of 50 times each winter, Percival said. Many times the trucks will be called out several times in the same day. Percival said the goal of the depart\u00ad ment is to have all Priority 1 roads, which include the interstates and major !X)mmuter routes, cleared within 10 .hours after a stonn. Priority 2 roads, all other state-owned roads, are cleared within 24 hours. Equipment used by the DOT includes medlum\u00b7~iuty trucks and heavy-duty four-wheel-drlve trucks. These are equipped with snow blades and spread a mixture of sand and rock salt on the roads. Percival said a mixture of half sand and half salt is effective down to a temperature of 23 degrees. In tem\u00b7 peratures lower than that, more sand is used. Waite said that although this winter will see a lot of snow, there probably won't be as much as in the winter of 193$\u00ad '36. That winter, which is said to be Iowa's worst, received 51 inches of snow. The cold and high winds combined for a very low wlnd~hill factor and many people were forced to burn com for fuel because nothing else was available. The lowest recorded temperature, however, came In another year, 1912. That winter, 47 degrees below zero was recorded at Washta, in northwest Iowa. Waite bases his predictions on the patterns that develop In the weather, the jet stream and, for very long-range forecasts, the sun-spot correlation. Using these methods, he said he has been right more than 70 per cent of the time. \"In long-range forecasting, 65 to 70 per cent is considered to be not too bad -It's better odds than flipping a coin. I like to think that even with 2-1 odds, we're giving an advantage to fanners and others who must plan on long-range forecasts,\" he said. 'owa City's \u00b7Morning newspaper Despite criticisms;Sadat firm CAIRO, Egypt (UPI) -President Anwar Sadat, denounced by his allies and deserted by members of his own cabinet, Friday accepted an Invitation to go to Jerusalem this weekend to address the Israeli parliament. \"I am going,\" Sadat said upon his return from Damascus and futile talks to win approval of the trip from Syrian President Hafez Assad. \"I always mean what I say.\" (In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin told a group of visiting U.S. congressmen that Sadat would arrive Saturday night, spend two nights in the KIng David Hotel, pray at Al Aqsa mosque Sunday morning and address the Knesset Sunday afternoon In either English or Arabic. MaSSive security precautions were\u00b7ordered.) Within an hour of Sadat's return from Damascus, Ismail Fahmi, Sadat's pro\u00ad American foreign minister, resigned \"because I feel that I can no longer carry out my duties and share the respon\u00ad sibilities under these circumstances.\" Sadat first named Mohammed Mah\u00ad moud Riad, minister of state for foreign affairs, to succeed Fahmi, but Riad resigned as well in apparent protest over Sadat's visit. Sadat then named a former professor and current executive on the AI Ahram newspaper, Butros Ghali, a Coptic Chris\u00ad tian, to fill both posts. Within hours of Sadat's acceptance, a bomb exploded at the Egyptian Embassy in Damascus. The Syrian government denounced the attack as a \"cowardly Boyd's constant worries: state, federal funding; fac.u/ty wages By NEIL BROWN Assoc. News Editor Editor's note: This is the last In a series 0/ interviews with seven 0/ the most powerful administrators at the UI. The series focuses on a.number 0/ im\u00ad portant issues lacing students and VI decision malters. Maintaining a strong faculty is the \"heart of educational programming,\" according to UI President Willard Boyd. \"People, not structures, make up a quality university. This is why main\u00ad taining our operating budget is a higher priority than getting capital funds for expanSion,\" Boyd said. Boyd, who has been UI president since 1969, said UI faculty salaries are com\u00ad petitive with the other Big Ten schools. He added that it is reflection on the quality of ~e UI faculty when other universities recruit UI professors. \"We have an excellent faculty and sometimes we lose faculty to other in\u00b7 stitutlons. We are hurt by this but it is Tho Deify lower>'Thom Oowtr sort of a tribute to the quality of the faculty we maintain. \"Faculty ~laries are always a serious problem, and we have a strong salary commitment,\" Boyd said. Working to obtain state and federal funding for the UI is one of Boyd's top responsibilities. He said Iowa Is \"financially sound\" but added that the spending tradition of the legislature forces some financial restraint. \"Iowans generally are not willing to spendmorethan they take in. They're not in favor of deficit spending, but I think that's wise. This has, however, forced a belt-tightening In requesting funds,\" he said. Although the UI took a cut in federal funding last year, Boyd said the UI has . been relatively successful in receiving federal money, because of educational programming. President Carter has not directly addressed educational issues but has a strong commitment to higher education,\" according to Boyd, who said attitudes toward higher education have remained fairly stable from the Ford to Carter administrations. Boyd said that although Carter has made a strong case in favor of national health insurance, he would be opposed to it if it would force a cut in funding for health education. ... lOYD, .,... \",.., act.\" There was no immediate report of damage or Injuries. Assad said after his meeting with Sadat he was \"deeply hurt\" over the Egyptlan President's decision. A Syrian government statement later said, \"We categorically r e j e c t Sadat's announcement and decision to visit Israel and we hold him personally responsible for the repercussions of his decision. \"During Sadat's visit to Damascus, the Syrian government tried to convince the Egyptian leader to change his mind, pointing out the dangers of his Intended visit and its negative effects on the Arab cause,\" the Syrian statement said. The Fatah Palestinian guerrilla group, issuing its first reaction to Sadat's visit, joined the denunciation. Thus far,. only , The Sudan, Egypt's Mrican neighbor to the South, has voiced support for Sadat's trip to Israel. (In Jerusalem, Begin said Sadat's visit would not interfere with efforts to reconvene the Geneva Mideast peace talks. Begin also touched on the op\u00ad position to Sadat's visit by Egypt's Arab allies. \"There have been some suspicions in the Arab world that we are trying to drive a wedge but this is not true,\" Begin said. \"We shall be very glad to meet all the representatives of the neighboring Arab countries.

Reagan LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (UPI) - Republican Ronald Reagan accused President Carter Thursday of distorting history and using \"a fonn of blackmail\" by raising the threats of Panamanian liots to sway Ute Senate into ratifying the Panama Canal treaties. He made the charges at a news con\u00ad ference prior to thl! opening of a three\u00ad day Southern Republican Conference. The Republican meeting will hear speeches by fonner TelBS Gov.

Bob Dole, R-Kans., 1976 candidate for vice president In President Ford's un\u00ad successful bid for re~lection. Reagan said public sentiment is overwhelmingly against the Panama Canal treaties, but the WhIte House is stalling a Senate vote until it can con\u00ad vince enough members that a pro-treaty vote would not hurt their re-election chances. EnellJY WASHINGTON (UPI) -A Pentagon official said Thursday the Defense Department has cut the amount of energy It uses by almost one-third since 1973, and cannot do more without en\u00ad dangering operations. Deputy Asst. Defense Secretary George Marienthal told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee that although the Pentagon still is the largest single energy user in America, further cuts would be \"detrimental to military readiness.\" He said the department projects it will increase its energy use in the next eight years by a lltUe more than 3 per cent. Subcommittee Chalnnan Gary Hart, D-Colo., told Marienthal the Defense Department could take the lead in demonstrating ways to conserve energy through solar devices and other \"unusual\" el\\ergy~urces. But Marienthal said he thinks the department Is a leader In energy con\u00ad servation because it recognizes that American dependence on foreign oil supplies is hazardous.

Asked when he thought a SALT II accord might be ready for signing by President Carter and Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, Warnke replied, \"It would not be unreasonable to look toward the first half of 1978 \" The pact would ~n need ratification by the Senate, where it faces opposition from conservatives who believe, on the basis of leaked reports on the negotiations, that the United States is giving away too much In its drive to limit U.S. and Soviet strategiC missiles and bombers. Mideast in turmoil over Sadat Warnke said Congress has a legitimate role in advising him on the negotiations, but added, \"It would be unwise to be In a position where Congress directs your negotiations. I don't deny the Senate's legitimate interest in the negotiations, but they can't take them over.\" His prediction on when the pact may be concluded would also mean the Senate ratifica\u00ad ton 'process could take place in the midst of congressional election campaigns. lJNITED NATIONS (UP!)\u00ad The rapid.fire developments in UIe Middle East have thrown ~' nonnally placid diplomatic p sses of the United Nations ahnost frantic disarray - arid Arab solidarity appeared to ~ straining at the seams. jEgyptian U.N.

Criteria for letter grades will be different for the lecture courses and the clinical-setting courses, said Logan. It is more difficult to grade a student on patient contact in the clinics, so the possible criteria for this would be how well the student identifies the treatment needed and carries it out. Better grades would be given when a student correctly treats a dif\u00ad ficult patient and does an ex\u00ad ceptional job. HERMIT CRABS ARE ONE OF NATURE'S MOST INTERESTING AND DEUGHTFUL CREATURES.

'TIL 9:00 II, Pile City, Io .... Friday, November 18,Im ~: Health care \u00b7 . In an effort to reduce the staggering rise In health care costs for Americans, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) Is investigating a proposal that will curtail funds to hospitals that faU to meet certain statistical standards. Included among these standards are provisions requiring lewpoln s Iowan Friday, November 18, 19n Vol. 110, No. 102 I 'hospitals to contain no more than four beds per 1000 requ1rlng hospitals to average an IKI per : . cent occupancy rate and requiring hospitals' obstetrical units to \u00b7 handle at least 500 such proposals are com- mendable. HEW'! Idea Is to prevent duplication of hospital services by urging consolidation of hospitals. Consolidation of services, HEW argues, makes for more efficient service to patrons. But HEW's proposal, which has engendered considerable bostillty In rural areas, especially Iowa, needs sharp recon- sideratlon. Rep. James Leach, R.-Iowa, has accused HEW of ~ . \"turning its back on rural America If these provisions are ap\u00ad I proved.\" At a community forum in Mount Pleasant on Wed\u00ad t nesday, Leach pointed out that HEW's proposal could severly C affect health care for the elderly. Seventy ol)e per cent of Iowans [ ~ ~ver 65 live in rural areas, compared to a national average of 32 Venezuelan paternalism emphasizes relative nature of freedom of the p\u00b7ress per cent. If the HEW plan is implemented, many rural hospitals would lose their HEW support, resulting In hospital closings, which can scarcely be interpreted as an improvement in health \u00b7 . care. Of course, services in metropolitan hospitals might ;. correspondingly be enlarged, but that can be slim consolation to I' those who depend upon local hospitals for life-sustalning '. medical aid. . The real issue ought to be quality of services provided patrons, . and one is at a loss to think of quality in a statistical sense. L Further, the HEW proposal seems likely not to reduce health .. care costs as the department believes. Dr. R. Tam of ~ Washington County Hospital points out that closing of rural hospitals In Iowa would necessitate patients' patronizing Iowa ~ City hospitals, \"where they charge almost three times as much I. for a bed as we charge at our county hospital.\" HEW seems to have applied uniform guIdelines to a health , care situation that is decidedly individual in nature. Rather than ~ . seeking to determine specifically whether hospital con\u00ad solidations would benefit a local area, HEW has made a blanket assumption for all hospitals and all areas of America. , Further, HEW has failed to consider that one of a hospital's ; principal functions is to provide emergency treatment, not just to sustain patients during lenghthy illness. It also seems to be a , truIsm that the location 'of doctors depends strongly upon their being able to practice at a hospital. Reducing the number of rural hospitals, which will be the ultimate effect of the HEW measure, would correspondingly mean fewer doctors establishing practice in rural areas. That, too, could hardly be interpreted as improved health care. ~ The HEW proposal would be especially perniciOUS to Iowans. Iowa State Department of Health Director Norman Pawlewski has estimated that demanding Iowa hospitals to attain an IKI per cent occupancy rate would require 70 of Iowa's 150 hospitals to close. Pawlewski further asserts that HEW is restricting a citizen's freedom to choose the source of her-his medical treatment. Pawlewski notes, \"If you close all small hospitals, you say, in effect, that you can't go to a hospital 10 or 15 miles away; you have to go to one 50 or 60 miles away. II By almost any standard of evaluation, HEW's proposal is ill\u00ad I,considered, and its implementation '!Vould contradict any conception of public health and welfare. However well intended, the measure must not be approved. DON NrCHOLS Assoc. Editorial Page Editor As Americans of the northern variety, we aU have our favorite freedom of the press stories. You know, the guy who's rotting in a south Texas jail for not telling about his sources, or the real stOry behind the headlines; but glances abroad sometimes lend a real perspective on such tales. For two years I worked on a small English language newspaper in Caracas, Venezuela, called the Daily Journal. The paper was and is reputed to be the best such newspaper In Latin America. One of the reasons for this reputation is Digressions dave albert simply that the Journal is based In a country called \"the last bastion of the free press in Latin America\" by the Inter\u00b7American Press Association. However, a recent incident in\u00b7 volving that newspaper demonstrates what a , relative quality press freedom is. It seems that after months of trying (they were trying when I left last January) the Journal got an interview with a local prisoner, Orlando Bosch. Bosch, for those who haven't beard of him, is a former Cuban doctor who, upon losing a lucrative practice when the revolution occurred in his homeland, embarked upon' a career as a telTorist. Among his more notorious ac\u00ad complishments was a bazooka attack on a Polish freighter in Miami harbor, an attack that landed him in the pokey for awhile. Somehow, and that somehow leads to the highest levels of the Venezuelan secret police staffed with Cuban exiles, Bosch made it to Venezuela on a Costa Rican passport with. an alleged guarantee of safe harbor. But when the convicted terrorist set foot on Venezuelah soil, he was promptly alTested. He has since languished in jail, speaking to no representative of the media until the local harmiess gringo newspaper got an interview. The interview led to some complications. As far as I have been able to discern with clippings and phone calls, the paper published a remark by Bosch to the effect that he thought he had received a guarantee from the highest levels of the Venezuelan government not to be harassed or arrested if he came to Venezuela, a country where anti-Castro terrorism is reputed to be the going thing. The Journal published this remark and was promptly sued ... by the President of Venezuela, Carlos Andres Perez. The ground for the suit? Offending the dignity of the President of the Republic. In \"the last bastion of the free press in Latin America\" there is a law that states that one cannot publish anything the president might find offensive. The suit was settled out of court, much to my relief, as the reporters named In the suit are two good friends. But that incident demonstrates what the concept of free press can mean to some. When I worked as a journaUst in Venezuela, I heard of presses being smashed by the police, front pages being changed by the police and publishers being told that If they published something that displeased the Foreign MInIatry they would be shut down. A television ataUon WII closed down for three days when It ran an In\u00ad terview with a person claiming to be from a PD& of kidnappers. . A radio station was shut down for broadc:utin& \"tendentious and misleading II reports ... 88 far IS the government was concerned. All this in I country proclaimed by International organizations as being the last free press In Latin America. The llne of thinking behind this concept of I free press is that the government is responsible for making sure that the media do not get out!i hand and pubUsh anything they damn well please. After all, this line of reasoning goes, If the government does not protect its. citizens em irresponsible journalists and a pack of lies foisted upon the public by those who control the media, who will? In short, that line of thinking reflects a group of'people deciding that they know what's best for the masses, and acting accordingly , And If DDt believes this kind Of thinking only occurs ill underdeveloped nations, one is fooling one's sell. It's a very common argument around newsrooms and living rooms alike in this country. I've heard it hundreds of times, if not more. We all feel that what is best for us must be for everyone else; it's human to believe that everyone else is like you. However, some of us are In a position to act upon this assumption, and the results can be disastrous. If we are to continue as a nation!i individuals, we must respect each person's iJI. dividuality to the fullest possible extent. 11IIt means that we cannot make up someone else', mind for them. Once we begin doing that, we II! no longer a free society ... and we have been doing that for years. Dave Albert. who i. the DT'.

I wish to thank the reporters who questioned me about my campaign promises that are as yet unfulfilled. Reminders help. One major campaign statement was that students are being ripped off by the UI by paying for recreation facilities that they often can't use. A report on this problem was presented at the senate meeting on Nov. 7 ... The issue on which I have expounded most 'often is certainly that of sexism in the Dr. I have drafted a bill that would enable the Student Senate to subsidize the Dr in return for cuts in offensive advertising. I feel that such a system is half a loaf, but is the best available in a capitalistic setting. Under the bill, the editor-in\u00ad chief would be responsible for screening ad\u00ad vertising for the ad department. The inevitable loss of revenue that would result would be made up by the UISAS, i.e., the students. The increasing conservatism of the UISAS has convinced me that such a bill hasn't got a snowball's chance in hell. The Student Senate recently couldn't even get it together to admit , that discrimination against gays occurs in Iowa City -and that was planned before some very conservative new student senators were ap\u00ad pointed by ARH. I write this letter then to inform my con\u00ad stituents that I have not forgotten one of the , major issues of my campaign. Rather, I am unable to take any direct action on that issue. I \u00b7 feel that it would waste the time of the UlSAS and myself to introduce the sexist advertising bill. Don Doumalles student senator some sweatshirts. The guard wouldn't let us in with the bag of popcorn but didn't seem to mind the backpack. The guard suggested we try to smuggle the popcorn in another gate, so we did.

The guards didn't stop us. Then came the Indiana game. At the first gate we tried the guard wouldn't let us in with my backpack. We then gave the backpack to a friend to smuggle In and went to another gate to try to get in with the bag of popcorn. The guard spotted the popcorn and in a surly voice told us we couldn't get In with it. We then successfully smuggled the popcorn In another gate.

As for those students who voted for the Tenant\u00ad Landlord Ordinance, I'm sure you're disap\u00ad pointed, but let me just say that all the problems that the Tenant-Landlord Ordinance intended to solve will be be cured just as soon as we cure the housing shortage that has beseiged this town for the last four years. The solution to the housing shortage is very simple. Get some apartments built. Unfortunately, as students we must contend with a community that is often hostile to our needs, especially housing. For those of you who want to solve the very real problems confronting us, as students I urge you to join with me in support of the effort by individual housing contraJtor.s to secure city approval to build more cheaiMlnd decent apartments, which will cure our housing shortage and hence other problems confronting us as students and as tenants.

WASHINGTON (UPI) - President Carter made no specific deals to win the shah of Iran's support fot an 011 price freeze, but he is detennioed to keep Iran rnllitarlly strong, press secretary JOOy Powell said Thursday. The shah, who left for Paris Wednesday after a two-day state visit marred by demon\u00ad strations, announced he would support a one-year price freeze among oil exporters even though Carter did not guarantee him the wea~nry he wants. But he expressed confidence he would eventually get the jet fighters, radar planes and other armaments on his list, and Powell's remarks suggested he has good reason to think so. At a briefing, the press secretary said Carter had given no specific \"quid pro quo\" - meaning no final arms sale agreements in return for the shah's change of heart on the 011 price issue. But he added: \"We consider our relationship with Iran to be extremely im\u00ad portant. We recognize their strategic importance to this country.

Abzug, a leading feminist who wID preside over the four-day meeting beginning today, said she hopes to a void any disruption between the opposing factions -femlnlsll and con\u00ad lle!'Vatives. But she emphasized : \"We are not afraid of controversy.\" Conservatives, portraying themselves as a \"pro-famUy\" coalition, meanwhile declared in a newspaper advertbement that the conference will recom\u00ad mend aUowlng homosexuals to adopt children. The ad began: \"Mommy, when I grow up, can I be a lesbian?\" Eleanor C. Smeal, president ri the National Organlzaton for Women, denoWlced the ad as InfIamatory and irresponsible propaganda . Smeal said leaders of the Mormon Church and right wing groups such as the K1u Klux klan and John Birch Society are recruiting women to attend a protest rally In an effort to lleceive the public Into thinking ERA does not have majority support. \"They're on the outside because they were rejected In their own states where the people know them. They lost In 40 of the 50 states (in elections to select convention delegates),\" Smeal said. Abzug told a news conference that the $40,000 In federal funds wID be spent for security at the conference, including \"per\u00ad sonnel and equipment.\" She noted some special measures are needed to protect Rosalynn Carter and two predecessors - Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson. The security force will in\u00ad clude a corps of 150 off.auty policewomen . Some 2,000 dele\u00ad gates and 6,000 observers will attend the meeting, with more than 10,000 other women ex\u00ad pected In the city for related meetings.

The conference, where femi\u00ad nists will outnumber conserva\u00ad tives 4-1, was expected to adopt a platform calling on Congress, the president and the nation to support the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion and lesbian rights. Abzug said polls show these ideas have the support of a majority of Americans . \"There are those who oppose any kind of change, but I don't think that is reflective of what American women want,\" she said. Noting the convention dele\u00ad gates represent women of all political views, religions and marital status, Abzug insisted the conservatives do not have a monopoly on \"family, God and country.\" The \"pro-family\" newspaper advertisement sought support for a coWlter-rally Saturday where Schlafly will be the main speaker.

The department's views were outlined to a llouse Judiciary subcommittee looking Into al\u00ad ternatives for payment of legal fees and the possibUity that such costs could become so burdensome that Justice in court may be priced out of reach for many people. \"We are very concerned ... the high costs of bringing or defending civil actions may have \\lle effect of denying ac\u00ad cess to the courts for persons whose means do not permit the payment 0( substantial attor\u00ad neys' fees,\" Paul Nejelski, deputy assistant attorney gene\u00ad ral, told the panel. He said the department is not totally against \"modification\" of current rules to cope with the problem of costly litigation, and In some cases, perhaps one party to a dispute should be awarded funds to pay legal expenses. But NeJelsld said legislation to allow that must be very limited. \"What we do oppose are broad-brush departures from the traditional American rule that requires litigants to pay their own attorneys' fees whether they win or lose,\" he said. \"It Is our view that the American rule is generally sound and that the burden of attorneys' fees should be shifted only in order to effectuate Before ... specific and compelling public Interests, and only then if the monetary and other costs of fee shifting are reasonable .\" Susan Gross, speaking for the CoWlcil for Public Interest Law, also urged the subcommittee not to enact a bill that would \"radically depart from the Amel\"ican . rule and generallJ permit fee awards to the win\u00ad ning party\" in a civil case. \"Few citizens or citizen groups could affOrd the risk 0( bringing a lawsuit, losing and then having to pay their op\u00ad ponent's attorneys' fees,\" she said. But she said legal costs should be recoverable In some cir\u00ad cwnstances because Supreme Court decisions on the awarding of attorney fees and related issues have threatened \"a dangerous narrowing of the rights of private citizens\" to judicial relief. water beds YOVARE WELCOME TO WORSHIP WITH US 10:30 Sunday Morning' St. Paul Lutheran Chapel 404 East Jefferson Thanksgiving Specials: 12 Pak Cold Pabst Blue Ribbon $3.29 Old Style $2.29 Anti-Freeze $2.89 Self Serve Gas Saves Ca$h ,VJS4\" 933 S.

District Judge Keith Hayes, admonishing the five-man, ee-woman panel and four temates not 10 discuss the case among themselves or read or listen 10 reports of the trial, 1o1d the jury: \"I don't want 10 slop this case and start all over again because someone fouled up.

Dummar bas testified of finding an envelope containlng the will shorUy after Hughes' death in AprU, 1976, and of following Instructions from a mystery courier 10 drop the will off at the Mormon church headquarters in Salt Lake City. One of Dummar's claims is that he met a bleeding old man -who Identified himself as Hughes '-In the desert outside Las Vegas In late 1967 and gave him a lift in his truck back 10 town. Opponents of the will, who believe the document Is a crude forgery, will present numerous handwriting experts, security personnel and doclors hoping to prove that Hughes did not write the will and never left the Desert Inn Hotel while he lived in the gambling capital from 1966-70, except under tight security.

Although the congressional visit had been planned for a month, the trip took on added significance In light of Som1la' s announcement Sunday that It was ordering out several Ibousand Soviet military and civilian advisers and closing Soviet bases. The first group of Russians left Wednesday. Even as the congressmen arrived at the airport to leave after seven hours of talks with Barre, several busloads of Soviet advisers and technicians were waiting for a Oight from Moscow to take them home. Somalia also broke diplomat\u00ad ic relations with Cuba and expelled the 44 Cuban advisers in the country. They left Tuesday. The eight-member group from the House Armed Services Committee met with Barre for 90 minutes of \"frank\" discus\u00ad .ions about the military balance In the region, the Indian Ocean and the Middle East. Rep. Melvin Price, D-Ill., who chairs the committee, said Barre showed \"openness\" in the talks. He said the Somali leader did not give them any message for President Carter. Price called the visit a \"fact finding\" mission and said his group does not speak for the U.S. government. Following Sunday's announ-cement, there was speculation that the United States had been asked to assist the Somalis, at least in some indirect fashion. Most speculation centered on the possibility of a third country giving Mogadishu assistance with the consent of the U.S. government. Iran was men\u00ad tioned as a strong possibility as the shah of Iran has just completed a visit to Washington . Price said the Somali decision to oust the Soviets \"came as a surprise to us and a surprise to Lawyer cites cover-up in Biko \u00b7death PRETORIA, South Africa (UPI) -A white lawyer charged Thursday that initial reports that Steve Blko died in jail on a hunger strike were part of a \"cover-up\" by police responsible for the black leader's safety. Lawyer Sydney Kentridge, acting on behalf of Bileo's family. grilled Col. Piet Goosen, head of security police In Port E1lzabeth. where Biko was kept naked, chained and handcuffed until hours before his death, for the second straight time In All illquest into the black leader's death. At e time of Biko's death in a police ceD in Pretoria Sept. 12, Pollce Minister Jimmy Kruger said the black leader had been on a hunger strike. An official autopsy showed later Biko died of brain injury and kidney failure. Kentridge asked Goosen Thursday: \"The minister was misled. Who misled him, and why? The story of the hunger strike was obviously an excuse and a cover-up. \"How high did the cover -up go?\" Ken\u00ad tridge asked. Goosen, sweating profusely under the questioning, did not answer. Kentridge also hammered away at Goosen's earlier testimony that Biko had hit his head following a scuffle in Port Elizabeth. Goosena said B' had one \"berseck\" and It too five po cemen to restrain the black leader and during the fight Biko hit his head, possibly accounting for the brain injuries. Questioning Goosen Thursday, Ken\u00ad tridge asked him whether after the struggle with the policemen he thought Biko feigned illness, to avoid being questioned further. \"At that stage, yes,\" the policeman answered. Goosen said he was not certain that Biko had suffered a bump on his head during the struggle. Kentridge : \"You knew very well he had a head injury but you wanted to draw the doctors' attention away from it?\" Goosen: \"That is not so.\" Kentridge then quoted from an affadavit signed by Goosen concerning the Biko death in which the police chief said everything had been done to make Biko comfortable.

IPBN director fires staffer, resigns Shortly after the verdict, defense attorney Richards \"Racehorse \" Haynes said the verdict proved his faith In the jury system. DES MOINES (UPI) -The executive director of the Iowa Public Broadcasting Network Thursday submitted his im\u00ad mediate resignation and just before doing so, fired a staffer who had provided allegations of network mismanagement to a legislator investigating Its oper\u00ad ations. Thomas M. Ditzel, who announced in September he would resign as IPBN's top administrative officer at the end of the year, told the network's supervisory board he was stepping down immediately to prepare for a new job opportunity, .. which he declined to identify in a four\u00ad line letter to the state Educational Radio and Television Facility Board. The board unanimously accepted the resignation and immediately hired Hugh Kordier to assume Ditzel's position on an interim basis until a permanent suc\u00ad cessor is found. Kordier is on the faculty of the VI and served as acting executive director of IPBN from late 1973 through June of 1974. Grand Illusion The board then went into executive session and discovered Ditzel-in one of his last actions as executive director - had given employee Michael Feld his ~ day notice of termination . The letter from Ditzel to Feld was not released and board Chairman Gary Koerselman refused to comment on the action, saying he had not reviewed the record of Feld's employment , which has lasted only several months. Feld, who was hired as a fundraiser at $16,500 per year, was informed of Ditzel's action by UPI and claimed it was a reprisal by network officials who were angered by his comments to legislative investigators. \"When you're supposed to tell the truth in government and then you have sonething like this happen, It really makes you wonder,\" Feld said. \"This place is run like a dictatorship ... I'm just shocked to hear Ditzel would go ahead and do that, but it doesn't surprise me, knowing how the place is run.\" Near the top of any list of the world's greatest films musl come Jean Renoir's antl-war classic, Grand Illusions.

He said he and La80nla have not gotten along since he was hired and portrayed LaBonla as a power-hungry administrator , contending Ditzel went along with him, fearful of the con\u00ad sequences had he refused. However, staff sources said Feld was fired because of his disruptive activities in passing along allegations of miscon\u00ad duct to legislators , many of them viewed as unfounded by IPBN officials. \"Feld has ~n nothing but trouble since he got here,\" said one IPBN staffer. \"He's followed me around, hoping to get the goods on us.\" LaBonia earlier Thursday told the board an in-house investigation had disclosed evidence that tapes of por\u00ad place is run like a dictatorship ...

But there were few reminders of the elaborate equlpment bought by Admiral R.E. Peary for his successful North Pole expedition in 1909 or author Ernest Hemingway and Presi\u00ad dent Theodore Roosevelt for their African hunts.

(UPI)\u00ad A high-level shakeup left this Dormally placid farming hamlet with just one police officer to protect Its 1,600 residents, but don't expect lDybody to declare a state of emergency. Police Chief Ted Blue was suspended by the Village Council this week, deputy Richard Fuller promptly re\u00ad signed and officer Jim Land suddenly became a one-man police department. No one panicked. Mayor Wavne Fulton went deer hunting. City Manager Nick Spencer went fishing. And Blue's wife stayed at her post as police dispatcher. \"This is deer hunting season,\" a woman who an\u00ad swered the telephone at the village offices said Thursday. \"There's only us ladies here.\" The council suspended Blue because of his alleged heavy\u00ad handed tactics with barroom tiplers and his selective lenien\u00ad cy with traffic violators. Following the meeting, Blue and Fuller handed in their badges. Fuller had planned to quit anyway. \"We hardly have any crime anyway,\" said Mrs. Blue, who was mum on her husband's whereabouts. \"I think we've had a couple of burglaries, but they were both solved. \"Armed robbery? I think we had one years and years ago. \"Mainly, we handle traffic violations and drunk driving.\" Those are the violations at the heart of the flap. Citizens complained that traffic offenses are zealously prosecuted - except when prominent resi\u00ad dents are Involved. \"We've also had a little misuse of the five-cell flash\u00ad lights,\" said police commlsslon member LatTy Shroyer. He said the past few years \"a half dozen or so\" citizens have complained of being clubbed by police outside the town's three saloons. All major Iowa towns fail to meet air tests Owners and patrons of the bars also claimed they were harassed by frequent bar checks and patrol cars lying In walt outside for drunken drivers. The chief was suspended on the weight of petitions bearing the names of ~ residents and village officials called In a special state police investigator to look for possible criminal violations.

A beer stein in one hand, a cigarette in the other, she Is defiance in\u00ad carnate. In another photograph, a modern malden in a see\u00ad through gown crouches against a tree. The two photographs are pari of the \"Women Look at Women\" photography exhibit on display at the UI Museum of Art through Dec. 18. The liberated woman of the Gay Nineties is a self-portrait by Francis Benjamin Johnston done about 1895; the nymph in the negligee is Judy Dater's \"Twlnka\" from 1970. The 75 photos in the exhibit show women in a variety of roles: welding and mothering, applying cosmetics and protesting war. Subjects range from the anonymous to the notorious: Gertrude Stein. John and Jackie Kennedy, Liz Taylor and Susan B. Anthony. Among the 30 photographers represented are Dorothea Lange, Marjory Collins, Diane Arbus, Margaret Bourke-White and Toni Frlssell. Although all the photos are of women and by women, the show illustrates more than the changing role of women. It can't avoid depicting the changes in our society, especially the changing role of illusion. In the Vietnam era and after, more cherisbed illusions have been stripped away. Margaret Thomas photographed a grisly scene of Intlwar protest. Drenched with a liquid meant to resemble blood, protesters carry chunks of raw meat. \"Stop the KJ.lIIng\" they cry. A Diane Arbus photograph portrays t\"o old people outlandishly arrayed in royal costumes. \"Their names \"ere pulled out of a hat,\" the caption reads. \"They were just chosen King and Queen of a Senior Citizen dance in New York City ... They have never mel before.\" The people in these final photographs seem to have 00 illusions left. Without them, the people are so exposed, so \"real\" that they become unreal. The situations are again artificial, and we have come full circle.

Memories of embarrassing scenes can make 111 shudder but we can also revel in the pleasant thoughts our minds conjure up from the past. Fully aware of the fruitful nature of juvenile experiences, III actors' workshop class has created a play dra\"\" from the members' childhood remem\u00ad trances. The production Is aptly named Us by Us and Is a series rt vignettes concerning such Theater IIDiversal experiences as nightmares, puppy love, first grade, and the special tricks all kids use to remember crucial things. Bruce Levitt, who teaches the workshop, explained that Us by U. rose spontaneously {rom improvisational skits done in \\he class. the por\u00ad trayal of youngsters is an ef\u00ad fective tool for developing acting talent. \"It's the same ability that children possess to play cowboys and Indians that makes acting exciting.\" He added that choosing Itlds as a subject matter \"was partially an attempt to recapture the spirit, energy and innocence with which children enter into a make-belieVe\" experience.\" Although the plot is not ab\u00ad stract, Us by U. is still a piece of experimental theater because its production situation is vasUy different from that of most other plays. There is no script, only minimal scenery and the actors are playing roles they have created and nurtured themselves.

Gruenewald painting a fake .~ MUNICH, West Germany (UPI) -A Bavarian back\u00ad woods artist said Thursday he produced the painting \"SI. Catherine of Alexandria\" which a Cleveland museum bought in 1974 in the belief it was a 16th century masterpiece. The C1evetand Museum of Art removed the painting three weeks ago, after spectrographic tests showed it was painted in this century. Hubertus von Sonnenberg, bead of the Doerner Institute for authenticating works of art, said his organization helped determine that \"St. Cath.erioe\" ns not ~inted by Matthis GruenewaJ<1 as previously thought. He said the Cleveland museum is giving the Institute the painting in return for its assistance. \"Of course, I painted Cath\u00ad erine,\" said painter Christian Goller when reached by tele\u00ad phone at his home in the Bavarian woods, \"But all I collected was 4,500 marks back in 1974.\" That would equal about $2,000. Goller, 34, lives In a converted grist mill in Laemmersdorf, east of 'Passau, near the Czechoslovakian border and said he has been painting in the style of the 16th century for the Postscripts Utility bills A Pttition Uldng trie riaing be Iigned at the Campus Information Certer In lit Union.

He said that for this r-----------, reason he has never had trouble with the law. But Sonnenberg said art I experts had attributed the \"St. Catherine\" to Gruenewald mainly because of an inscrip\u00ad tion on its back. \"Th~ ~script~on obviously was affixed ~ll the intention of faking an old i master ,\" Son\u00ad nen.berg said. \"I will visit Goller sometime next week, to see whether he put the inscription there or not.\" \"I don't know what inscrip\u00ad tion he is talking Goller said when informed of Sonnen\u00ad berg's statement. \"When the painting left my studio, there wasn't anything on the back as far as I can remember. But I'd have to look at the painting to be sure.\" The Cleveland museum bought the painting from Frederick Mont, a New York art dealer, who was acting as agent for an American lawyer Mont will not identify.

International The scenario is strangely familiar. The Dallas Cowboys undoubtedly are worried. Last year Dallas was regard. ed as the NFL's strongest team through the first half of the season. Last year the Cowboys were handed their first defeat by the st. Louis Cardinals. Last ~ear an Injury to Roger Staubach in the seventh game hampered the quarterback's throwing and the offense began to sputter. That led to an opening-round playoff loss 10 Los Angeles In which the Cowboys scored only 12 points. This year? The Cowboys won their first eight games and had all of Dallas talking Super Bow\\. Then the St. Louis Cardinals handed the Cowboys their first defeat. Meanwhile, St&ubach is nursing a badly broWsed hip and a sore thumb on his throwing hand. The Cowboys' offense has fallen off considerably in the last two games. week the Cowboys' sluggish offense will require more liberal use of Dorsett. The coach also hinted he may start the talented rookie for the first time Sunday when Dallas travels to Pittsburgh for a rematch of the 1976 Super Bowl teams. Although Dorsett is Dall~' leading rusher, Landry has been starting veteran Preston Pearson, a good pass receiver without the e%ploslve running ability of Dorsett, who has been averaging only 12 c81Ties per game. But the Cowboys, w~o are averaging 344.6 total yaros per game, manqed only 236 against St. Louis and 254 the week before against the New York Giants. \"I don't really kno\" what Coach Landry is going to do from week 10 week, but it would be a big thrill for me,\" Dorsett said about the possibility of !\\tarting against the Steelers. \"I always want to do well, especially there ... Playing back in my hometown, In front of my family and the many, many friends I made there in four years.\" The fonner University of Pittsburgh star was born and raised In Aliquippa, Pa., an hour's drive from Pittsburgh. He ho~ to be drafted by the Steelers and Is trying to get 80 to 100 tickets for his first return to Pittsburgh as a professionli. \"We haven't played good for the last three or four weeks and a loss was inevitable,\" Landry said. \"The Cardinals have made things Interesting again In the diviSion, particularly with us going to Pittsburgh next week.

In commemoration of \"Jackie Robinson Day in Brooklyn,\" a portrait of the infielder was unveiled to be placed in a lobby of the nearly all\u00b7 black school, celebrating its 10th aMiversary. Nevertheless, he earned at most about $40,000 a year, Abrams said, far short of the six-flgure salaries common in major league baseball today. \"We were born 20 years too early,\" he said. Robinson was active In business, politics and drug prevention programs after his retirement from baseball in 1956. But for students at the school which bears his name, his greatest mark was on the advances with ease \"He gave so many other youngsters something they can look forward 10 if they have the ability 'and the know-how,\" said ex-Dodger catcher Roy Campanella, who received a standing ovation. \"Before he played, it was an Impossible thing for blacks to do,\" said Joseph Williams, a bespectacled 12 year old. \"He did the Impossible and many others followed.\" LONDON (UPI) -Topseeded Swede Bjorn Borg blasted his way to a 6-2, 6-3 win over Andy Pattison of Rhodesia Thursday to advance to the quarter-finals of a $135,000 International tennis championship.

McGuire fights pressure ~ full-range, no-compromise stereo systeDl for only $ 719 COLUMBIA, S.C. (UPI) - Frank McGuire, admitting he has been under pressure from some circles to retire as head basketball coach at the Univer\u00ad sity of South Carolina, said Thursday the situation has seriously affected his reo cruiting. McGuire declined to specify where the pressure was coming from, but House Speaker Emeritus Solomon Blatt, a strong influence on university activities, has been linked to the situation. Blatt's grandson, Greg, recently resigned as one of McGuire's assistants to take a similar job at The Citadel. \"The most difficult thing to do is keep quiet,\" McGuire told a meeting of businessmen . \"Thank God the people are saying It for me.\" McGuire said he was on the verge of signing a highly respected &.(oot-ll high school player from the New York area when the youth read about the turmoil in the program. \"It's difficult to tell him what's going on when he reads they want me to retire,\" McGuire said. \"It does hurt your program something awful.\" Dr. James B. Holdennan, university preSident, asked McGuire recently to step down as basketball coach and become athletic director for the university's regional campuses but the offer was later with\u00b7 drawn. McGuice said he did IlDt initiate the idea. \"I t used to be nice to come to speak to a group. and never worry about what you have to say, but when you've been under the pressure I've been under the last two years, each word has to be measured,\" he said. McGuire, who has compiled \\ six 2O-game-win seasons and a 236-107 record in his 13 years at South Carolina, said some persons came to him last year after the team went 14-12 and asked him how old he was. \"What has age got to do with not winning 20 games?\" he asked. \"I feel the same.

Miller is the leading all-tlme rusher In the Big Eight with 4,802 yards and is the only player In conference history to top the I,OCJO.yard mark three straight seasons. He set a school slngle-game record with 246 yards against Missouri last Saturday, currently ranks as the nation's leading rusher and wt11 carry a string of 18 100 yard games into the Iowa State contest. There are only two remaining pinnacles for Miller to reach this year: the Big E~ht single\u00ad season rushing record and the Helsman Trophy. He needs 141 . yards against the rugged Cyclones to put a cla1m on the rushing record, but that task will be easy compared with what he faces in ~g the Heisman. Miller has run for 1,525 yards this year to trail Greg Pruitt's Big Eight \u00b7record 1,66$ yards. But Miller has rushed for 150 or more yards four times this season, and with nothing else to play for In a frustrating ~ season, the Cowboys can be expected to keep giving their flashy tailback the ball until he sets the record. Miller was the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy after leading all underclassmen in the balloting in 1976 with a fourth place finish. But the Reisman has not gone to a player from a losing team since 1958 when Paul Hornung won it while playing for a z..a Notre Dame team. \"I wouldn't call it an injustice if I didn't win it,\" said Miller. \"I Intramurals By RON DUNGAN Sial!

(UPI) -Wolverine Coach Bo Schembechler, who was put on probation for criticizing officials earlier this IU8On, said Thursday he hopes \"everybody Is playing well -including the officials\" In the Ohio me now,\" Schembechler said. \"I jll8t said that In this game, I hope everybody Is playing well -including the officials.\" The outspoken coach of the Wolverines, no stranger to diScipline for his frankness, was placed on probation by Big Ten Commissioner Wayne Duke after he criticized the solit crew that worked the Duke-Michigan game the second weekend of the season. - Schembechler charged the Atlantic Coast Conference officials who worked the game favored their team while the Big Ten officials \"stood around like goons\" and didn't work to COITeCt the situation. \"The players come In for criticism after a game, the coaches get criticized, the officials should be subject to criticism, too,\" Schem\u00ad bechler said 48 hours before Michigan and Ohio State were to clash to deCide which will represent the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 2. \"I can't say a tb1ng about the officials,\" he said. repeating one of his favorite refrains. \"That Isn't right. \"There should be more pressure put on the Commissioner (Duke) and more pressure on the officials to do a good Job,\" he said, adding something new to his lecture. \"They can walk around the nert day and say, 'Ha, Ha, I made a mistake in a game,' and nobody can do anything about it.\" An innocent \"What's your biggest worry?\" question started Schembechler down a winding trail of words that led to his comments about the men who will keep the game from geWng out of hand. \"The unexpected mistake,\" he said eully. \"The fumble, the Interception, the key penalty ... Are the officials going to be good... . \"We've got to do something about it (the of\u00ad ficiating situation),\" Schembechler said. \"The level of officiating has been down overall this season. We've lost a lot of good ones to the pros and to retirement. \"I don't want any more (on the field),\" he said. \"We've got enough.

Only two teams, lhIrd-ranked Alabama and 11th-ranked Arizona State, have clinched bowl spots but most of the top 19 ranked clubs are expected to be heading for post-season action. Alabama, the Southeastern Conference champion, will be the host team in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 2 and Arizona State, the Western Athletic Conference titlist, is the host club for the Fiesta Bowl on Dec. 25. pass altl)gether . Last year Michigan did not gain an inch passing yet won easily, 22~. In the five previous meetings, however, the game was decided by seven points or less. Among the remainder of the top 10, Notre Dame, Arkansas, Penn State and Pittsburgh are virtually assured of getting a bowl bid Saturday. Sixth-ranked Noire Dame, if it beats Air Force as expected, probably will accept a bid to the Cotton Bowl where it hopes to meet top-ranked Texas on Jan. 2. Texas, however, is not yet assured of winning the Southwest Conference. The Longhorns, who play Baylor Saturday, must beat Texas A&M on Nov. 26 to earn the host spot in the Cotton Bowl. Notre Dame, though, is likely to take its chances on Texas winning the SWC and accept the Cotton Bowl bid over one from the Orange Bowl. Rod Gerald, Ohio State's crafty junior quarterback, will be boping to pull a few tricks off on Michigan when the Buckeyes travel to Ann Arbor Saturday in bopes of avenging last sea\u00ad son's Z%-f defeat. The biggest game on Satur\u00ad day's schedule in terms of bowl interest will be the battle at Ann Arbor, Mich., between fourth\u00ad ranked Ohio State and fifth\u00ad ranked Michigan for the Big Ten Conference championship. The winner of that contest advances to the Rose Bowl where it will meet the Pacific Eight champion on Jan. 2. The loser is expected to get an in\u00ad vitation to the Sugar Bowl. The Pac Eight winner won't be decided until Southern California meets UCLA on Nov. 25. Washington, UCLA and Stanford are still In contention but UCLA needs only to defeat Southern Cal to lock up the Rose Bowl berth. Arkansas, ranked No.7, remains a leading candidate for the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl and will probably get the bid if 11 beats Southern Methodist. Eighth-ranked Penn State and ointh-ranked Pittsburgh, both of whom are idle this week, are each hoping to play in the Or$llge Bowl opposite the Big Eight cbampion . - On The Line with the 01 Sports Staff l'be Big Eight champion Our readers have expressed a lack of confidence in the Hawks this week, as they pick Michigan State to end Iowa's chances for a ~ season.

And there isn't a clear-cut favorite in either game. Pittsburgh is the home tearn in its clash with Penn State. This rivalry is probably the c10sesl of any long\u00b7slandng rivalry . in the country. Over a period of 76 years, the Nittany Lions have won 37 limes, the Panthers , 36, and there have been just three ties. During the 1977 season, each team has lost only once, Penn State to Kentucky, Pittsburgh to Notre Dame. The Panthers were also lied by Florida. They faced three oommon opponents, Syracuse , Temple, and West Virginia. Syracuse gave both powers the most difficulty, losing by just seven points to each of them. Pitt bombed Temple, 76-0, while the Lions beat Temple this past weekend , 44-7. And against West Virginia, the Panthers showed a much better defense, beating the Mountaineers, 44-3. Penn State whipped West Virginia, 4~28 . What's it aU prove? Nothing! It's a whole new ball game when these two square off against each other. Our winner: Pittsburgh by seven points. The last lime that a team other than Ohio Slate or Michigan represented the Big Ten Conference in the Rose Bowl was in 1968 .. Southem Cal beat Indana, '14-3. So for the tenth straight year, the Buckeyes and the Wolverines wilt decide who goes west The only blot on Michigan's record -and who -can forget it--is the 16-0 upset by Minnesota. Ohio State was beaten by Oklahoma in an outstanding college classic, 29-28, so the Bucks are the only undefeated team in league play. Michigan leads in the series, 40 to 28, zipping Ohio State last fall, 22'(). The Wolverines are the hosts, but we think Ohio State win sNp by the hosts by just one point. After demolishing T.C.U. last Saturday , the Texas Lon\u00ad ghorns will make Baylor their tenth straight victim and their seventh in the Southwest Conference. The spread: 19 points. And Texas A & M will warm up for its date with Texas next week by whipping the same Texas Olristian by 26 points.

'!be opponents ran, passed, waltzed and giggled their way to touchdowns -floods of 'em. GoaJ-line stands were: a) a place to sit, or b) when the other team was farced to punt. FollowiDg the exodus of Frank Lauterbur as the head man after the '73 season, in\u00ad coming Coach Bob Commings made defense a top priority in the rebuilding program . Commings named Larry Coyer, his top defensive assistant at Massillon (Ohio) Washington High Scbool. as the man to get the job done as defensive coordinator. Four years later people don't laugh at the Iowa defense anymore. \"No.1, pride was lacking when we first got here:' Coyer said of that first season. \"We knew that we had to start on the defense because you can't win without it.\" TIle biggest test came in a goal-line effort against Ohio state earlier this season. From the Iowa one-yard line, Buckeye fullback Joel Payton, the nation 'sleading scorer, cracked into the middle of the Hawkeye defense four times. Four times he was stoPJ?ed. \"I think plays like that are an indication of two things,\" Coyer said_ \"One, we're recruiting better players, and two, there's been a change in the players' The Hawkeyes \"\u00a2 to ~ baD.\" 93 ONFM Stereo Rock 24 hours a day ANNOUNCING!

The kids didn't think they could do it before, but we're not going to tolerate anything but the best. We're as.king them to make a com\u00ad mitment. and we expect them to do their best. \"Once you get that com\u00ad mitment, you apeal to a player's pride. The tough hours are a great investment. After tha t, it's harder to play and lose.\" Much of that time and effort for Coyer (surprisingly, he was a quarterback in his college days at Marshall, W. Va.) is spent on the practice field, preparing the members of the defense, both physically and mentally . \"On defense, once a kid gets a basic understanding of wbat you're trying to do theory-wise, he'll have the ability to execute based on emotion and intensity so he can get to the football. Defense is a reaction; you have to know where you're sup~ed to be and get to the ball.\" Get to the ball. It's a phrase Coyer used often on the practice field. It sums up his approach to defense. \"You can't play defense just by thinking,\" he said. \"It has to be reaction, and played with emotion. It fits the tem\u00ad perament of players like Moore, Harty, Vazquez, Molini ... they don't like to stand around.\" The unit plays a wild, emotional defense based on an all-out eUort from every player on every play. Coyer is not pleased when he doesn't get that effort, and he lets the of\u00ad fender know about it -loudly. \"We try and put more pressure on them in practice than they'll get in the games,\" he explained . \"I believe that can realistically be done. Practice is an intense situation -it has to be. Tbe better you do the job in practice, the better you'll do it in the game.\" Despit~ that intensity, recent losses had the team reeling emotionally before last weekend's win over Wisconsin . \"It's very galling when you play well enough to win, but don't quite pull it off,\" Coyer admitted before the 24-8 triumph over the Badgers. \"It's a depressing situation, and il drains you mentally and emotionally. \" But the schedule of recent years, dOtted with the like of naUonal powers Southern Cal, Penn State and UCLA, in ad\u00ad dition to a steady diet of Ohio State and Michigan, doesn't allow for any head dragging. Supposedly \"lesser\" teams on the schedule make up for that. \"We may play well against Michigan and Ohio State, but people forget that Indiana, Purdue and the others are tough teams, too,\" Coyer said. \"Our schedule is unbelievably tough but I believe that we can play any team in the nation at, or near even.\" Coyer backs that claim up with the Hawkeyes' per\u00ad formance against Michigan. \"I thought it was the best defensive game we've played since I've been at Iowa,\" he said. \"They played tough and aggressive, and it's saying something about the program when you can say you had the best player on the field -and there was no question that Tom Rusk was the top player out here that day.\" Still, Coyer sees a few more hurdles to clear before the Iowa program turns the corner on meidocrity. \"We need more quality recruiting, which Coach Commings is certainly doing,\" he said, \"and we need more team speed. I've seen a great back like Terry Miller (Oklahoma State's Heisman Trophy candidate) on a play where nobody blocked for him, and he still ran for a TD. \"TIlen again, you also have to have an equally talented defensive ba~k who can win his percentage of battles during a game. We need those type of players to take us from the middle ground over the top.\" For now, Coyer sees all the possibilities that come with hard work, and his enthusiasm betrays the oeaceful at\u00ad mosphere created by the curling smoke from his pipe. \"Right now, we are very close to being good,\" he said. \"Statistics are one thing, but I really believe that we have one of the two top defenses in the Big Ten. ' \"We want to be tops in the conference, and I think that we can realistically achieve that goal. The No. 1 thing now is to grit our teeth and stick to it and get it done -nobody said it would be easy.\" The Doily 1_ Ff1Inco Coach Larry Coyer Mahmens makes transition from imitator to intimidator By BECKY DAV'S staff Writer For most of the 1977 football season, sophomore defensive tackle Mark Mahmens has imitated the Hawks' Big Ten opponents -now he intimidates them. Mahmens was a member of the demo squad until he got a chance to play in the closing minutes of the Ohio State game. The fonner first team all\u00ad state linebacker from Goose THt: Lake explained that he made a good showing against Ohio State and was given his first 0p\u00ad portunity to start against Purdue. Mahfnens didn't just appear on the. starting line-up, however, as he says it was a gradual move with a lot of hard work involved . \"This position is a tough one to work your way up to. With guy:; like Joe Hufford and John Harty, there's always the pressure to do better and work Get there anyway you ean: ClINTON STII(ET MAti harder,\" Mahmens explained. The 6-2, 245-pounder says his toughest game so far has been Indiana, not Purdue, Michigan, or Wisconsin, \"Purdue and Michigan had much bigger guys than me, but since I was shorter I could get underneath and control them,\" Mahmens added. He explained tha t Indiana had shorter, quicker players who posed more of a problem for him. Mahmens described one such Indiana player as being \"built like a firestump.\" In last week's victory Mah\u00ad mens found himself badgered hy one of the Wisconsin of\u00ad fensive guards, and when words didn't settle the disupute, a black eye did. Unfortunately for Mahmens, the black eye belonged to him. He said it was worth it, however, as he went on to shine with four solo tackles and two assists during the game, in\u00ad cluding twe quarterback sacks. Mahmens said he sees this week's game with Michigan State as \"a big one for us.\" \"They're real quick and our job will be to keep going after them,\" he said. \"We want to end the season on a winning receiving end of HStNkeye -passing attack By STEPHEN STOLZE Staff Writer Every time Iowa recruits another receiver some fan may scoff that the ends at Iowa get about as much action during the season as the Hawkeye football team does on New Year's Day. But one receiver wbo might help change that situation is sophomore Brad Reid. Reid, from Linn-Mar High School in Marion, came to Iowa this fall from Iowa Lakes Junior College In Estherville, after leading the nation in pass receiving last year. He caught 56 passes for 992 yards in only 10 games. That was quite a change for Reid from his days at high school. \"In high school, we weren't really \"8 passing team,\" Reid said. \"We had a good running game, and used the pass more for the big play.\" Even though Reid was a major factor in his Linn-Mar team finishing fourth in the state class 3A tourney in 1976, there weren't a large number of major schools after his ser\u00ad vices. \"Iowa did recruit me, but they were the only big school that did,\" he said. \"Iowa initially said they had a scholarship for me, but later they changed their minds and wanted me to be a walk~n . I didn't really go for that idea.\" Instead, Reid decided to go the junior college route and chose Iowa Lakes. \"I decided on Iowa Lakes because they had a reputation for passing the ball. I figured that if I was on a passing team, I might have a better chance of getting noticed. I went there to get what I didn't get in high school,\" Reid ex\u00ad plained. Reid admitted that his sudden success at Iowa Lakes was a little unexpected, \"I was sur\u00ad prised at IU'st, but once we started throwing the ball a lot, I began to imagine how many passes and yards gained were possible,\" be said. \"I started setting goals and tried to reach 40 passes and 1,000 yards.\" People began to take notice of Reid very quickly after the word went out on the kind of season he was baving. \"Other schools started recruiting me, and a lot of different op\u00ad portunities came up last year that I never had before,\" Reid said. \"Iowa State recruited me, but I guess I always bad Iowa in the back of my mind. \"I knew au the coaches at Iowa well, got along with the players on visits, plus the university was closer to bome, and now I had a name in the state, and I wanted to keep it there.\" One asset that helped Reid lead the junior conege ranks in receptions is his exceptional speed. At !)O10 and 170-p0unds, speed and quickness more than make up for any lack of size. He is as fast as anyone on the 10wa team, and the swiftest of the receivers, having been timed at 4.5 seconds in the (O.yard dasb this Jall. 'Only two other Hawteyes, both running backs, could match that time. With that kind of speed, it's no surprise that Reid's favorite pass route is \"the deep pat\u00ad tern.\" But the long pass is a difficult one to complete when a team is behind and is forced to play catch-up as Iowa has had to do several times this susoo. \"We try to run the short patterns the mCll!rt,\" Reid said. \"We like to make the defense think that we're going to pass short, and then we'll try and run the deep pattern and hope to catch them out or posUion.\" 11 someone didn't know Reid's jersey number, he still wouldn't be hard to spot on the field as he is more than likely to be the one doing the footbaD version of Pete Rose's head-firsl dives OIl the basebaD fieJd. But the only thing Reid dives for are passes. \"I just react on a pass when I dive for a ball,\" he said. \"I don't particularly like the synthetic turf because it's so hard, but I guess I'D just keep doing it and hope I don't get hurt.\" Although be splits playing time llVith Mike Brady as they bring in the plays from the sideline, Reid said be doesn't mind the set up ... I did the same thing in high school because we didn't pass much. The recetvers need some time to rest after blocking downfield every play,\" he said. \"My main goal this year was to learn the offense as weD as possible,\" Reid said. \"We run the same pass patterns here as we did at Iowa Lakes which makes it easier. \"I didn't expect to be reaJ productive this season_ I have to learn the tricks of the trade. It's hard to come into the Big Ten and have the kind of year I bad last season.\" 500 Iowa Avenue Iowa City, lowa.52240 (319) 353-7111 Hours: Monday 9:00 am -6:00 pm Tuesday -Friday 9:00 am -4:30 pm By HOWIE BEARDSLEY Staff Writer When discussing the past history of Iowa football with Jerry RlDlta, the look on his face alone gives you an in\u00ad dication that the times have been disappointing. Not because the Hawkeyes must search back to 1961 to find their last winning season, but because the senior signal caller must retrace his own steps hack to 1974 in order to recall his last experience of playing in a game situation. Runta is a ..... , 226-p0under from Gillespie, m. He came to Iowa with credentials that could speak for themselves - a four year high school letterman, starting quarterback his junior and senior years on squads that captured a pair of state football championships, not to mention allofitate recognition. Yet Runta bad never been a part of the collegiate battles that occur on football Saturdays. Four years and not even one snap from center. \"I received a lot of offers from other schools,\" recalls Runta. \"But after ~g with Coach Commings (following the Hawkeyes 6-11 nightmare in 1973) I thought that I could fit into the plans.\" Whether Runta could have been part of those plans is a question he has had four long :Vf'ar\" to an\"Wer. A quelltion that he feels he bas paid the price for. And an answer that many times has him looking back to wbat could have been. \"I spent the first two years on the demo teams,\" said Runta, ''paying my dues. Last year I thought things would be dif\u00ad ferent. I guess it just didn't work out. \"I feel that J could have played. There were times when the guys playing ahead of you had their problems They weren't performing as well as you feel you could. And it really eats at your. guts. \" But Runta is not fed up with the football program here at Iowa. After all, football is not just the donning of a helmet and shoulder pads in his eyes. \"I'm not disappointed that I came here,\" he admits, \"because I've met a hell of a lot of wonderful people. Friends that I'll have the rest of my life. And that's vitaJ.\" Being a member of the team has given Runta the opportunity to learn, not only in -regard to football, but also in the form of life and an education as well. Ingredients which added together, have given him the chance to do some growing up. 'Many times players come to college thinking only of foot\u00ad ball,\" Runta said. \"I grew up in the last couple of years. Getting an education is more important than football. And I'm very, very happy about my education .\" Runta is a perfect example that. it takes an entire team to make a good team. He is an asset to the Hawkeyes not only in regard to helping the other quarterbacks, but also in the form of a powerful throwing arm that has gained the respect of many of his teammates. \"I throw a lot during one on one drills and to receivers against the defense, allowing the other quarterbacks to be able to work on game plans. I like to throw because I feel that that is my asset to the team.\" When a person performs day in and day out only to become just another spectator come game time, you can't help but wonder why he sticks to it. . Runta admits that he has asked himself that same question on more than one occasion. \"But I've gone this far, why quit now? I'm not a quilter. I've never quit at anything.\" As for the future, Runta has hopes of being accepted into graduate school to continue his education in the field of wildlife and management. He will look back on Iowa football with mixed emotions. Emotions that he says were at times frustrating and disappointing . But at the same time, remembering the unforgettable friendships, and the respect he earned from more than just his teammates. Havvk Gilbaugh hurdles 6no sports' program By MIKE O'MALLEY Staff Writer It seemed like things would be easy (or Greg Gilbaugh after his junior year of high school. After aD, GDbaugh \u00b7 had just been named tile outstanding athlete in his conference while at East Rockford (ID.) High School, after being selected to all\u00ad conference teams in football, wresUing and track. His size (6- ., ~2.o pounds) as an offensive guard would be raising the eyebrows of college football coaches throughout the nation, all atempting to get his signature on the dotted line of a letter of intent.

You name an extra-ctlITicuiar activity, and the Rockford schools dropped it. And you are not wrong if you guessed money was the cause. \"They-just didn't have enough funds for all the extra\u00ad curricular activities,\" Gilbaugh explained. \"Rather than decide on which activities to give up, the whole program was drop\u00ad ped.\" Empty fields and gym\u00ad nasiums are not exactly good news to young athletes intent on eamil!g college scholarships. \"Some people just quit working out and just said, 'What's the use?'\" GDbaugh explained. \"There was a negative attitude. Two other players moved to other cities to play, but most guys just gave up the idea of trying to get scholarships. Most of them were content to go to Rock Valley (an area junior college), and some people tried to walk\u00ad on at other schools. I didn't want to hurt my chances, because there's a lot of com\u00ad petition between guys for scholarships.\" . The family solved the problem by moving to nearby Loves Park, where Gilbaugh participated in athletics at Harlem High School. \"I was the last child in the family, soit wasn't that much of a problem to move,\" be said. \"It was more of an emotional thing to get over, moving to a new place. In a way, it helped me adjust to the transition of going to college here.\" His play that senior season showed enough promise to bring former Iowa offensive coor\u00ad dinator Kent Stephenson on the recruiting trail, and Gilbaugh was invited to see the Iowa team in action. That could have ended the Hawkeyes' recruiting chances right there. \"Everytime I came to see them play, they lost,\" Gilbaugh smiled. \"I saw them play Indiana (a 14-7 Homecoming loss) and Purdue (a 21-0 whitewashing) last season, and Michigan State (a 27-231085) the year before.\" . Regardless, Gilbaugh liked what he saw in both the athletic program and the school itself. 328 S.

I also wanted to stay somewhere close so my parents could see me play.\" Tbe choices were finally narrowed down to Minnesota, lliinois and Iowa. \"Minnesota was a nicer school, but it was too big,\" he said. \"People here and the facilities are nice. People are down on it right now, but the program's great. I had that feeling when I was recruited, and I feel it now.\" The transition from high school to college \"ball has been quickly hurdled, as Gilbaugh worked his way to a starting position against Michigan. Surprisingly, after startmg m his freshman year, Gilbaugh doesn't have any professional football ambitions. \"This (college) is it for football,\" he said matter-of\u00ad factIy. \"It's T-minus three years and counting. I have no ambitions to go into the pros, I just want to set up my dentist shop. Why go into pro football and lose all my teeth; what kind of dentist would that be? I could say, 'Ya like my teeth? -I made 'em myself.' \" Joking aside, Gilbaugh is serious when discussing the future of Iowa football. \"I realize this has been a disappointing year because we haven't won as many games as people thought we might. We've gone out and smacked people hard yet come up short. Next year, though, we'll remember Purdue, Arizona, Indiana and the others. We'll go into those games with a little more fire in our eyes.

Hawks, Spartans play for high stakes By ROGER THUROW Sports Editor If the Hawkeyes think they have a big stake riding on the last game of the season, they ought to take a look at the chips Michigan State is throwing on the. table in the 1977 finale. While Iowa will be battling for pride and respect, needing a win to match last season's :H; record, the Spartans will be trying to crash the exclusive Big Two club of Michigan and Ohio State. A victory over Iowa Saturday, coupled with an Ohio State win over Michigan, would leave the Spartans with a 6-1-1 conference record and sole possession of the Big Ten's runner-up spot. No small feat for a team that at the beginning of the season had more question marks than a final exam. But the Hawkeyes, who at one time had bopes of recording the fIrst winning season at Iowa in 16 years, aren't lacking for incentive either. \"There are two motivating factors in this game,\" said Iowa Coach Bob Commings . \"Pride, of course, is paramount, but it would also be nice to win the last game of the year, especially for this team, which has played better than its record indicates. It's nice to be able to say we are still im\u00ad proving this late in the year. We have played good tough football the last three weeks. Micbgan State is an awfully good team, but we are not intimidated. We'll be ready.\" And so will the Spartans, who are on a\u00b7 four-game winning streak. Under the direction of Ed Smith's golden passing arm, Michigan State has outscored its opponents '238-1.s, rolling up 131 points in the last four outings. The Spartans have played everybody tough this year, even Notre Dame and Michigan. The No.6 rated Irish barely escaped with a 16-6 win, while the fifth-ranked Wolverines squeezed past their crOSS-f>tate rivals 24-U. The aerial circus out of East Lansing, Mich., has gotten most of the publicity since Spartan Coach Darryl Rogers arrived on the scene last year with his passing philosophy. But the most dramatic aspect of Michigan State football has been the rapidly improving defense. \"Last year we had the No. 2 offense in the Big Ten as we averaged S.S yards per play. But our defense couldn't stop anyone,\" Rogers was saying at the beginning of the season. \"We also gave up an average of 5.S yards per pLay last year.\" But that was last year. This season the Spartan defenders are rated third best in the conference against the run and in overall point stinginess - behind only Michigan and Ohio State in both catergories. \"The defense has to be the most improved part of our team,\" Rogers said. \"The stats may not be that impressive, but we are better than last year. We don't have a tremendous amount of stars. It's a team defense more than an individual one.tt Rogers' defense may be a team effort, bllt there are players that make their presence felt more than others -especially guys like tackles Larry Bethea and Mel Land, linebacker Paul Rudzinski and safety Tom Graves. \"Michigan State has the best defensive tackle combination in the league with Bethea and Land. Some say that Bethea will be the No. 1 defensive draft choice in the conference,\" Coromings said. But getting back to the of\u00b7 fense, Rogers has been able to complement his aerial attack with a solid ground threat this season. Last year quarterback Smith led the Big Ten in total offense, but this season he's dropped to seventh because he's got the league's fifth and sixth leading runners in the same backfield . Fullback Jim Earley has been averaging 63 yards per game while tailback Leroy McGee has chewed up ground at 351-5209 a 72-yard P.ef\" game clip. When he wants to pass, however, Smith has three ftrst\u00ad rate receivers as targets. Flanker Kick Gibson, split end Edgar Wilson (who also plays baskethall) and tight end Mark Brammer have all accounted for more than 300 yards with their receptions. With the return of tailback Dennis Mosley, who has picked up 155 yards in the last two games, the Hawkeye offense has perked up, and the defense showed signs of returning to early season form in Iowa's 24-a win over Wisconsin last week.
