Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the NWCCU is not partial , but applies to the institu tion as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution.

All activities not sponsored by NUNM must be preapproved by the patient services and outreach manager or the student 's school/ college director (or designee) , and must have a designated NUNM faculty or staff advisor/supervisor. A tracking form must be signed and filed with the Registrar's Office upon completion of the event. Activities that qualify for community education hours must be designed to enhance the student's ability to present oneself professionally to the public or other professionals outside of their respective fields while increasing the awareness of naturopathic and classical Chinese medicine in the community. Community education opportunities are plentiful and may be of the student's own design, or may be preplanned events such as health fairs, community events and professional association activities where students are educating the public about natural medicine. Projects that educate the NUNM campus communi ty are also appropriate, as long as the skills gained are applicable to becoming a naturopathic physician or a practitioner of Chinese medicine. In addition to public speaking, students may earn community education hours for conducting research and/or producing written materials that increase community awareness of naturopathic and classical Chinese medicine. These events are not to be used as foru ms in which students practice medicine, give specific medical advice or diagnose disease. Twenty -four total hours of community education are required to meet ND and DSOM requirements for graduation.

Transfer credit po licies and course descriptions are outlined in the university catalog. There must be a difference in hours between a transfer course and the university's course and/or a question of equivalency of material covered in order for a challenge exam to be given. After the challenge exam has been administered, the grade is recorded and the student is notified of the results. If the student fails the exam, they must register for the course and pay the appropriate tuition. To be considered for a challenge exam, th e student must: Complete transfer credit review during the admissions process to identify which courses may be eligible for challenge. Students who are applying for transfer credit reviews must sign the \"NUNM Transfer of Credit Agreement\" form upon admission to the university. Transfer credits will not be considered after matriculation. Submit a \"Transfer/Challenge Exam\" form (obtained from the registrar) to the director of the academic program and the instructor ( for which the challenge exam is related) for approval. Once permission is obtained, the director (or designee) will facilitate arrangements for the student to take the challenge exam. Pay the appropriate fees and submit an \"Exam\" form, available from the pro gram 's academic coordinator , to the instructor before taking the exam. See the Financial Policies section in the catalog for information on fees. Take the challenge exam prior to the offering of the course that is being challenged; the exam must be taken, graded, and the grade submitted to the registrar no fewer than two weeks prior to the start of the quarter in which the course is offered.

Earning graduate credits as an underg raduate is not a guarantee of future admission into any graduate program at National University of Natural Medicine. 2.13 Auditing Students may audit a lecture course, space allowing, if they have met the prerequisites, have obtained the instructor's sig nature, and have registered for the course. The course will appear on the student's official transcript as an audit, even though auditing means that a student will not be evaluated or receive credit. Classes taken as an audit must be declared by the end of the quarter's second week. Audited courses are not eligible for challenge exams. See the Financial Policies section in the catalog for information on fees. 2.14 Educational Enhancement Registration Current students who wish to repeat a course they have previously passed at NUNM may do so, space allowing, with the permission of the instructor and school/ college's director . The \"Education Enhancement Registration\" form must be filed by the end of the q uarter's first week. No credits or grades will be given. See the Financial Policies section in the catalog for up -to-date information on fees. 2.15 Adding/Dropping Academic Courses Students are registered for all core courses and may not deviate from the established curriculum unless they have submitted and received approval via the Petition to Deviate process (see Deviation Policy) . Student s will self -register for electives. During week one of each quarter, students may change sections in courses for which this is applicable. During this same period, they may also register for elective courses, and must submit an \"Add/Drop\" form with proper signatures to the Registrar's Office . For ND students, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) may not be added once the quarter has begun (they must b e registered for prior to week one ). Courses may be officially dropped only by submitting an \"Add/Drop\" form with proper signatu res to the Registrar's O ffice. No core course can be officially dropped without the school/ college director's signature and/or an approved \"Petition to Deviate \" (see Deviation Policy) . In addition, students who are on federal financial aid and reduce course loads that result in a change in enrollment status from full time to part time must meet with the director of financial aid. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 27 Week 1 - Students may add/drop/change sections/ change to audit and receive a 100% refund with a grade of \"W\" (withdrawal) on the transcript. Change to audit requires instructor signature. Week 2 - Students may add/drop/change sections/ change to audit, instructor signature required. Students may drop/change sections and instructor must indicate the grade of \"W\" (withdrawal). A refund will be administered at 75%. Week 3 - Students may drop with instructor and (corresponding program) director signature required, and instructor must indicate the grade of \"W\" (withdrawal). A refund will be administered at 50%. Week 4 - Students may drop with instructor and director signature required, and instructor must indicate the grade of \"W\" (withdrawal) or \"WF\" (withdrawal failing). A refund will be administered at 25%. Weeks 5 -12 - Course can't be dropped. Failure to attend a registered course will result in the grade of \"F.\" No refund given. All courses starting after week one of the term will follow the same add/drop policy as outlined above. Non-attendance in any course will earn a grade of \"F.\" All grades are included on student transcripts. For courses that do not run the full 12 -week term ( i.e., weekend and short -term courses) , students may use the \" Add/Drop\" form with appropriate signatures to add or drop a weekend /short -term course up to one week before the course begins. See the catalog for corresponding refund policy. Lab and retreat fees are non -refundable once the term begins, even when the course occurs later in the term. Students who are withdrawing from the institution will receive a grade of \"W\" regardless of the w eek they withdraw. See the NUNM catalog for more information on the withdraw process and corresponding refund policy. Adding/Dropping Clinic Rotations To add or drop a clinic al rotation, students must contact the associate registrar. Students have a 3-5 day period after the clinic assignment schedule has been posted to make any changes to their clinic schedule (add or drop rotations) without being charged. This period is known as the \"clinic adjustment period.\" The final deadline date to make changes is i ndicated on the clinic schedules. Students who request any changes in their clinic rotations after the deadline must request approval through the d eviation process (see Deviation Policy ). The student will be notified of the decision by the associate registrar. Students are responsible for attending their current clinic shifts until decisions are finalized. All fees concern ing clinic rotations will apply ( see catalog for fees). The NUNM enrollment census date is the Monday of week three. SECTION 3: ACADEMIC PROGRESS AND ACADEMIC STANDING 3.1 Satisfactory Academic Progress The Academic Progress Committee meets each academic term to determine students' academic progress. Financial aid recipients who fail to make satisfactory academic progress in any term will be subject to the terms and conditions outlined in the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policies in place for that office (see c riteria for Continued Stud ent Eligibility in the student 28 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 handbook). These policies are separate from the institution's satisfactory academic progress policies. If a student is not making satisfactory academic progress during a course prior to the end of the term, the faculty memb er may request the student to access tutoring; and may share concerns with the school/college director and/or the Center for Academic Success. This may include, but is not limited to, classroom attendance, performance on examinations, as well as any other factors that may impact the student's success in the course. Students who have \"reached maximum timeframe status,\" as outlined in the Academic Progress section of the catalog, are considered not to be making satisfactory academic progress and will no longer be eligible for federal financial aid. Undergraduate Programs \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" is defined as: Meeting and maintaining the minimum grade point average requirements (2.00); and Having a completion rate of 67% of courses attempted per term ; and Having less than the maximum of 1.5 times the number of credits required to graduate, i.e., students cannot enroll in more than a cumulative of 136 attempted credits; and o Multiple withdrawals from courses will impact a student's eligibility to make satisfactory academic progress. Degree completion within the maximum length of study (defined as 1.5 times the length of the longest undergraduate program); and Taking a minimum of 12 credits each term (excluding summer, unless applicable), unless on an approved deviated track. Students are considered not making satisfactory academic progress who: Earn a term GPA of less than 2.00 and have a cumulative GPA below 2.00, or Earn a term GPA of less than 1.50 Master Degree Programs \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" is defined as: Passing grades in all academic courses and clinical rotations (for clinical students); and Passing all program requirements within one and one -half (1.5) times the length of the longest published enrolled program, generally between 3-5 years (with the MSOM being 6 years); and Maintaining a minimum number of credits each term (excluding summer, unless applicable), unless on an approved deviated track. o For SGS degrees, the minimum number of credits per term equals 8 credits per term. o For the MSOM degree, the minimum number of credits per term equals 11 credits. Students who earn a term GPA of less than 2.50, and have a cumulative GPA below 2.65, are considered not making satisfactory academic progress. MSOM and MSiMH clinical studen ts who receive two or more failing grades in clinic rotations or entrance/exit exams are considered not making satisfactory academic progress in a 12 -month period. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 Degree Programs \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" is defined as: Passing grades in all academic courses and clinical rotations (for clinical students); and Passing all program requirements within one and one -half (1.5) times the length of the longest published enrolled program, generally between 5- 7 years; and Maintaining a minimum number of 11 credits each term (excluding summer, unless applicable), unless on an approved deviated track. Students who earn a term GPA of less than 2.60, and have a cumulative GPA below 2.75, are considered not making satisfactory academic progress. Clinical students who receive two or more failing grades in clinic rotations, or entrance/exit exams are considered not making satisfactory academic progress in a 12 -month period. 3.2 Academic Standing The Registrar's Office monitors student GPAs (both ter m and cumulative) for academic standing and credit completion at the end of each term (including summer) to determine sufficient progress toward degree completion. The Registrar's Office will notify the student and the Center for Academic Success when the student is not making satisfactory academic progress. Students receiving financial aid should review the financial aid satisfactory academic progress requirements for continued eligibility in the catalog. Incomplete grades are not calculated as a part of a student's GPA. Academic standing and insufficient credit completion are evaluated separately, as described below. The following categories are used to describe a student's academic standing when unsatisfactory: Undergraduate Programs Academic Warning Academic warning status occurs when a student earns a term GPA of 2.95, and/or a cumulative GPA of 2.85, or receives two or more grades of \"C\" in a term . While on a warning status, a student is expected to meet with an academic advisor to develop a plan to address the concern. Academic Probation Students are placed on academic probation when they: Earn a term GPA of below 2.75 and have a cumulative GPA below 2.80; or Earn a failing grade of \"D\" or \"F,\" including clinical rotations; or Fall below full- time status for more than one term (unless on an approved deviated track) When placed on academic probation, a student must meet with an academic advisor in the Center for Academic Success to sign an academic contract within one week of notification. The academic contract will identify needed resources, including but not limited to remedial work, additional coursework, tutoring, or repeating course(s); and requires that the student improve their GPA and not fail any other courses during the probationary pe riod. Students who fail to complete an academic contract will be withdrawn from any courses in which they are currently enrolled. Students are advised to meet with their university advisor(s) to discuss strategies for successful completion of their progra m. 30 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Students are removed from academic probation once they have earned a minimum term GPA of 2.80 and have a cumulative GPA of 2.85; any failed courses or clinic shifts are repeated and passed; and the terms of the academic contract are met. Students ma y not register or receive financial aid until a current academic contract is on file in the Registrar's Office. See the Criteria for Continued Student Eligibility for Financial Aid SAP policies in the catalog. Students who fail to complete an academic cont ract within one week may be withdrawn from any courses in which they are currently enrolled and/or placed on registration hold. A student who does not meet the criteria to be removed from the current level of standing, and who does not escalate to the ne xt level of standing, will continue on in the current standing and be subject to the same requirements. Academic Suspension Students are placed on academic suspension when they: Earn a GPA below 2.60 and cumulative GPA below 2.75; or Earn two or more fa iling grades of \"D\" or \"F\"; or Fail two or more clinic rotations, entrance exams, or exit exams; or Fall below full- time status for more than one term (unless on an approved deviated track) Academic suspension occurs when a student is ineligible to enr oll at the university for a specified period of time. Suspended status is noted on the student's official transcript. A student has the right to appeal an academic suspension to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee, as outlined in the student handbook. Master Degrees Academic Warning Academic warning status occurs when a student earns a grade of \"C.\" While on a warning status, a student is expected to meet with an academic advisor to develop a plan to address the concern. Academic Probation Students are placed on academic probation when they: Earn a term GPA of below 2.70 and have a cumulative GPA below 2.75; or Earn failing grades of \"D\" or \"F,\" including clinical rotations; or Fall below full- time status for more than one term (unless on an approved deviated track) When placed on academic probation, a student must meet with an academic advisor in the Center for Academic Success to sign an academic contract within one week of notification. The academic contract will identify needed resourc es, including but not limited to remedial work, additional coursework, tutoring, or repeating course(s); and requires that the student improve their GPA and not fail any other courses during the probationary period. Students who fail to complete an academ ic contract will be withdrawn from any courses in which they are currently enrolled. Students are advised to meet with the Center for Academic Success to discuss strategies for successful completion of their program. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 31 Students are removed from academic pro bation once they have earned a minimum term GPA of 2.75 and have a cumulative GPA of 2.80; any failed courses or clinic shifts are repeated and passed; and the terms of the academic contract are met. Students may not register or receive financial aid unti l a current academic contract is on file in the Registrar's Office. See the catalog for Criteria for Continued Student Eligibility for Financial Aid SAP policies. Students who fail to complete an academic contract within one week may be withdrawn from any courses in which they are currently enrolled and/or placed on registration hold. A student who does not meet the criteria to be removed from the current level of standing, and who does not escalate to the next level of standing, will continue on in the c urrent standing and be subject to the same requirements. Academic Suspension Students are placed on academic suspension when they: Earn a term GPA of below 2.60 and have a cumulative GPA below 2.75; or Earn two or more failing grades of \"D\" or \"F\"; or Fail two or more clinic rotations, entrance exams, or exit exams; or Fall below full- time status for more than one term (unless on an approved deviated track) Academic suspension occurs when a student is ineligible to enroll at the university for a specifie d period of time. Suspended status is noted on the student's official transcript. A student has the right to appeal an academic suspension to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee, as outlined in the student handbook. Doctorate Degrees Academic Warning Academic warning status occurs when a student: Earns a term GPA of 2.95 and/or a cumulative GPA of 2.85; or Earns two or more grades of \"C\" in a term While on a warning status, a student is expected to meet with the Center for Academic Success to develop a plan to address the concern. Academic Probation Students are placed on academic probation when they: Earn a term GPA of below 2.75 and has a cumulative GPA below 2.80; or Earn failing grades of \"D\" or \"F,\" including clinical rotations; or Fall below full- time status for more than one term (unless on an approved deviated track) When placed on academic probation, a student must meet with an academic advisor in the Center for Academic Success to sign an academic contract within one week of notific ation. The academic contract will identify needed resources, including but not limited to remedial work, additional coursework, tutoring, or repeating course(s); and requires that the student improve their GPA and not fail any other courses during the probationary period. 32 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Students who fail to complete an academic contract will be withdrawn from any courses in which they are currently enrolled. Students are advised to meet with their university advisor(s) to discuss strategies for successful completion of t heir program. Students are removed from academic probation once they have earned a minimum term GPA of 2.80 and have a cumulative GPA of 2.85; any failed courses or clinic shifts are repeated and passed; and the terms of the academic contract are met. Students may not register or receive financial aid until a current academic contract is on file in the Registrar's Office. See the catalog for Criteria for Continued Student Eligibility for Financial Aid SAP policies. Students who fail to complete an acade mic contract within one week may be withdrawn from any courses in which they are currently enrolled and/or placed on registration hold. A student who does not meet the criteria to be removed from the current level of standing, and who does not escalate t o the next level of standing, will continue on in the current standing and be subject to the same requirements. Academic Suspension Students are placed on academic suspension when they: Earn a term GPA of below 2.60 and have a cumulative GPA below 2.75; or Earn two or more failing grades of \"D\" or \"F\"; or Fail two or more clinic rotations, entrance exams, or exit exams; or Fall below full- time status for more than one term (unless on an approved deviated track) Academic suspension occurs when a student is ineligible to enroll at the university for a specified period of time. Suspended status is noted on the student's official transcript. A student has the right to appeal an academic suspension to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee, as outlined i n the student handbook. Naturopathic students who fail only the Structure & Function I lecture, in their first year first - term, will be placed on a cademic probation due to the balance of credits. However, more than one failing grade and/or not raising GPA s in the second term may result in suspension. 3.3 Maintaining Active Enrollment for Satisfactory Academic Progress To maintain an active enrolled student status, a minimum enrollment of one credit is required. Any student who does not enroll in a minimum of one credit each quarter will be considered withdrawn and must reapply, and will be subject to the graduation requirements in the catalog specific to the year of reapplication (this does not apply to standard summer breaks). Master and Doctorate Degrees Students who have met all course requirements but have outstanding graduation requirements such as a thesis/capstone, clinical hours, clinical proficiency objectives (CPOs), preceptor hours, or other graduation requirements, must register for eit her one credit of \"Thesis/Capstone Completion\" or one credit of \"Graduation Completion\" each term until all graduation requirements are met. Students also must adhere to the maximum length of program requirement. Students are not eligible for financial aid while registered for a thesis/capstone or graduation completion credit. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 33 Master's degree students have a maximum of one academic year to complete their thesis/capstone. ND students have a maximum of two academic terms to finish all outstanding requirement s. Failure to register each term for thesis/capstone/graduation completion credit will constitute a withdrawal. If a student wants to continue beyond the maximum length of program timeline, they will be required to meet with the director of academic suc cess and access and their program 's director to determine if they may continue at NUNM. The director of academic success and access and program 's director will assess if the student can demonstrate knowledge retention and skills of their program. If it is determined that the student has gaps of knowledge and/or skills, the student will be required to complete additional academic and/or clinical work. Students who are granted an extension to continue their program beyond the maximum length of program deadlin e may then be matriculated under the university catalog of the year of their extended program, and are subject to the graduation requirements of their program listed in that catalog. Students will be required to sign an academic contract. 3.4 Academic Review and Appeals Committee Meetings of the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC ) are not legal proceedings , but are an institutional process with a degree -program specific outcome. The committee is composed of four faculty members (appointed each year by s chool/ college director ), dean of students, and chaired by the registrar (who convenes the meetings). ARAC hears grade appeal petitions ( see Grade Appeal Policy) as well as appeals from suspended students. A suspended student wil l have three business days , from the date of the sanction notification , to submit an intention to appeal to the registrar/ARAC chair . The student then has seven calendar days to submit the written appeal and supportin g documentation to the registrar/ARAC chair . An appeal should include the following materials if applicable: Letter explaining any extenuating circumstances (including but not limited to health issues, death of family member, etc.) Unofficial NUNM transcript Copies of exams and/or quiz score s Copies of emails between student and instructor if relevant Copy of syllabi for failed courses Written plan for what you will do differently to succeed Essential elements reviewed by ARAC during student hearings include, but are not limited to: Student progress in courses Failure of courses, clinic shifts or OSCE/entrance/exit exams if applicable Failure to maintain minimum level GPA Failure to complete an academic contract in a timely manner Failure to comply with the terms of an academic contract Failure to follow approved and/or published curriculum layout Failure to make satisfactory progress in a required capstone or research project The committee will review the appeal and make a decision. The d ecision may be, but not limited to, any of the following regarding the student's change of status : The ability to continue in the program under academic probation status 34 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 If concurrent degree, suspension from one program Requirement of personal counseling or support for the conduct in question Develop and sign a revised academic contract with the Center for Academic Success that outlines a timeline for resolving GPA concerns. This may include additional restrictions on new coursework undertaken by the student until the probation status is lifted. Suspe nsion from NUNM A student who is academically suspended a second time will be expelled from NUNM, and will forfeit the opportunity to enroll at NUNM. See the handbook for expulsion details. 3.5 Record of Academic Review and Appeal Committee Proceedings An audio recording of the committee proceedings and confidential deliberations will be made, and individual members and/or the chair may take notes during the hearing. The recording and any notes are prepared by and for the committee members to aid in review of the hearing and any appeal of the committ ee's decision. To protect confidentiality and the integrity of its process, neither the recording nor the notes are available for student review. The official record will include: Written submissions by the student, including supporting documents Evidenc e received or considered, including written statements and exhibits by other students, faculty and others; and summaries of any witness testimony at the hearing or meeting Statement of the matters officially noticed Findings and conclusions by the committe e Written summary of the hearing Final decision letters, including any appeal decision letters Stipulations and agreements Documentation of the fulfillment of, or failure to fulfill, any sanction These documents will become a part of the student's academi c records file, and will also be part of the student's permanent record. 3.6 Appeal of Academic Suspension A student may appeal the decision of ARAC. Students suspended will have three business days, from the date of the sanction notification , to submit an intention to appeal to the appropriate school/ college director. The student then has seven calendar days to submit the written appeal and supporting documentation to the director. The director (or designee) will respond to the written appea l with a final decision within 10 business days, not including weekends and published holidays that the university is closed, based on assessment of the information presented by the committee, the student, and a review of the investigation process and proc edure. In an unusual circumstance, the director (or designee ) may request an extension beyond the 10 business days to the chief academic officer if there is additional information that must be taken under consideration. The director or designee, will notif y the student with an approximate decision date if it appears that the appeal will take longer than 10 business days. An appeal must contain the basis for the appeal limited to one or more of the following issues: Failure of the Academic Review and Appeal s Committee (ARAC) to follow the procedures set forth in the policy on unsatisfactory academic progress 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 35 The sanction is grossly out of proportion/alignment with the offense Information relevant to the decision that was not available to the committee for consideration at the time of the hearing The director (or designee) may elect to uphold the decision of ARAC; reverse the decision; request a different resolution; or refer the case back to ARAC if there is new information that was previously not available to ARAC for consideration. The director's (or designee's) decision is final and no further appeals are available. 3.7 Reapplication and Readmissions Policy Undergraduate Programs Undergraduate students who have been academically suspended cannot submit an application for readmission to NUNM until the following criteria have been met: Demonstrated success of a minimum of 12 credits from an accredited college or university with a GPA of 2.50 or higher ( submit transcript to the Office of Admissions); and Submission of a reapplication to the Office of Admissions. The student should include a personal assessment of their poor performance, and a plan of action for successful completion of their NUNM degree. NUNM may impose the following requirements upon read mission for a student who was academically suspended: 1. Student must meet with the Center for Academic Success to sign and comply with all conditions of an academic contract; and 2. Return on academic probation until the student earns a minimum term GPA of 2.5 0 and has a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. Expelled students are ineligible for reapplication or readmission to NUNM. Completing these steps does not guarantee readmission to NUNM. These are the criteria for consideration for reapplication. Questions re garding this policy may be directed to the director of admissions, director of the School of Undergraduate and Graduate Studies , or dean of students. Master and Doctorate Programs Students who have been suspended cannot submit an application for readmission to NUNM for a minimum of one calendar year from time of suspension, unless noted differently in the suspension letter. A suspended student who wishes to apply for readmission to NUNM must meet one of the following criteria at the time of suspen sion: The student had a serious illness or medical issue An event, or series of events, occurred that prohibited the student's academic performance due to high levels of stress. Examples include but are not limited to a death in the family, divorce or separation from a long -term partner, or assault Documentation of a disability that can be, but has not been previously or reasonably, accommodated The student experienced any other serious problem that significantly affe cted academic performance 36 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Documentation may be required to prove that the situation leading to suspension has been remedied. NUNM may impose the following requirements upon readmission for a student who was academically suspended: 1. Complete remedial work p rior to readmission, repeating some courses and/or clinic shifts. 2. Meet with the Center for Academic Success to sign and comply with all conditions of an academic contract. 3. Return on academic probation for a minimum of one academic year, and until all previously failed courses have been resolved. Students who have withdrawn, either administratively or voluntarily, from NUNM must wait one application cycle to apply for readmission. Withdrawn students are required to follow the application process as outline d by the Office of Admissions. NUNM may impose one or more of the following requirements for a student who applies for readmission, and has been separated from NUNM for more than one year: 1. Take an entrance exam prior to entering the clinic to assess skill level. 2. Complete remedial work, which may include repeating some courses and/or clinic shifts. 3. Meet with the Center for Academic Success to sign and comply with all conditions of an academic contract if on academic probation when withdrawn. The student will remain on academic probation until all previously failed courses have been resolved. 4. Submit and pass an additional drug screening and/or background check. Expelled students are ineligible for reapplication or readmission to NUNM. Completing these steps does not guarantee readmission to NUNM. These are the criteria for consideration for reapplication. Questions regarding this policy may be directed to the director of admissions, school/ college director (s) or dean of students. SECTION 4: ATTE NDA NCE AND EXAMINATIONS 4.1 Eligibility to Attend Classes and Clinical Rotations Students are authorized to attend only those classes, sections or a clinical rotation for which they have registered. Students may only be enroll ed in Moodle course s for which they are registered ; this enrollment is automatic when enrolled in SONIS. Students who are absent without permission from the program 's director (or designee) the first day of class, or the first shift of a clinical rotation , without permission from the direct or (or designee ) may be dropped from that course, especially if there is a waiting list. 4.2 Attendance and Participation NUNM fosters a rigorous and engaging academic educational environment. Students are encouraged to attend all classes, tutorials and labs. Students are responsible for learning the content from any classes that they miss. Due to the nature of practicals classes (e.g ., tutorials, labs, etc.), attendance, preparation and active participation are imperative and cannot be made up. NUNM expects a minimum attendance of 80% for all courses. Each syllabus will define the course attendance requirements and will stipulate the number of permitted class absences. Students absent more than the permitted number may be subject to a reduced grade or failure of the course. Faculty may take into account the level of participation and habitual tardiness when calculating a course grade. Students are responsible for being aware of, and for meeting, their faculty's attendance expectations, which are deta iled in each course 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 37 Students who believe they have a disability that inhibits their attendance and participation in class or clinic are encouraged to contact the Center for Academic Success to discuss potential accommodations. 4.3 Absence Polic y Within the context of an adult learning higher education environment, NUNM understands that life events outside of student control happen occasionally. Possible reasons for missed courses include , but are not limited to , minor or major illness of students or their dependents, family emergency, bereavement , religious holiday/observation , and preapproved attendance to academic conferences. In an effort to reduce undue burden on students, supporting documentation is not required as long as the absence does not exceed the attendance threshold set by faculty. Faculty will exercise discretion on absences within the established attendance requirements for their course as outlined in their syllabus. Faculty may require the stude nt to make up missed sessions, establish make -up assignments, and/or expect that the student will independently study the material that they missed. Faculty decisions on absences can be appealed to the appropriate program 's director . Students who are expecting a longer absence for factors outside of their control (i.e., military deployment, hospitalization) should contact the Center for Academic Success to discuss a leave of absence or w ithdrawal. 4.4 Examination s and Completion of Assignment s Students are required to complete all examinations and assignments on schedule. An unapproved absence from an examination will generally be granted a grade of zero. Please note that NUNM does not accommodate a student's desire to take final ex aminations early due to travel arrangements or other reasons that are not outside of reasonable control. Students who miss an examination for reasons outside reasonable control must contact the instructor (ND students contact the course director) in charge of the course within 24 hours. The faculty /course director may approve or deny this request. If approve d, students will provide documentation of the approval to the Center for Academic Success when schedul ing any make -up exam s. There may be asso ciated costs with make -up examinations. Students whose applications are denied will not be allowed to take a make -up examination which may result in failure of the course. Students whose missed examination applications are denie d may submit an appeal to the school/ college director (or designee ) along with supporting documentation. The director (or designee ) may grant or deny this appeal at their discretion. If the appeal is granted , the student will be required to make up an equivalent examination. This e xamination will be equivalent in content but may be different in structure and style than the originally scheduled examination. Assignments submitted after the deadline will be graded according to the policy stated on the course syllabus. Students who b elieve they have a disability that inhibits their ability to complete examinations or assignments should contact the Center for Academic Success to discuss potential accommodations. 38 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 4.5 Testing Center The NUNM Testing Center, managed by the Center for Academic Success, is for students with eligible academic and/or disability accommodations and those with approved absences. An accommodation letter or approved absence notification from faculty must be on file with the Center for Academic Success for the exam to be administered. The Testing Center administers tests for didactic courses only, and does not administer remediation, practical or proctored examinations (exceptions may be made for students with registered testing accommodations). Students will receive instructions on how to schedule their exams; notification and confirmation of a reservation should be made no less than three business days prior to the time reserved. Exams scheduled less than th ree full business days in advance may not be available at the Testing Center, and therefore may not be administered at the time of reservation. Students with approved absences should schedule their exams upon receiving written permission from faculty; thos e with academic and/or disability accommodations are encouraged to reserve the entire term at once to ensure priority stations. Tests should not be scheduled to overlap with another class; including students taking exams with an academic and/or disability accommodation , unless previously approved. Students are only allowed to reserve a station for the allotted time, per exam, as allowed by faculty. Additional time is only granted to those with approved academic and/or disability accommodations. Students who are late for their scheduled appointment may not be given extra time, and may need to reschedule their test. Failure to take an exam, without prior approval, will be communicated to the faculty member and may be considered as a failed grade. The follo wing may be considered violations of the Academic Integrity Policy and/or Honor Code: going over allotted time, not taking an exam within a deadline, and/or violations of the Testing Center Rules and Expectations. 4.6 Online Testing Verification Some NUNM courses have exams and quizzes that are administered in an online learning format. For those quizzes and assignments, students may need to complete a \"Statement of Authentication\" attesting that they completed their own quiz and/or assignment and foll owed the directions provided by the faculty member. 4.7 Proctored Online Exams There are times when an online course may require a proctored midterm and/or final exam. Faculty can offer no more than two proctored exams per quarter. Dates or date ranges f or the proctored exams will be provided by the faculty member on the syllabus, which is posted on Moodle at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the term. For on -campus students, pre -arranged time(s) will be arranged by the faculty member when students may take exams in -person/in -class. If the student is unable to attend the exam at the pre - arranged time, the student must arrange for a volunteer proctor or arrange to take the test with a proctor. Online students must arrange for a volunteer proctor o r arrange to take the test with a proctor if the test is not administered within the online course scheduled time. Students who are using an exam proctor must complete and submit the \"Online Proctored Exam\" form by the end of the 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 39 week of the course, declaring which method of proctoring (on- campus or on -line proctoring) they will use to complete testing requirements. For on -campus proctored exams, students are requested to do the following: 1. Open the \"Proctored Exam\" form. 2. Enter \"NUNM\" as the proctor, first and last name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. 3. Check their university- assigned email for the scheduled exam times. An academic administrative staff member will schedule group times for the exam. 4. Proctored exams on the NUNM campus ar e not offered on a \"walk -in\" basis. 5. To take the exam, students must present a photo ID such as a NUNM student ID or driver's license. For off -campus proctored exams, students submitting an \"Online Proctored Exam\" form are requested to do the following: 1. Find an off -campus proctor and seek approval by an academic program support administrator from your program. Friends, relatives, co -workers, or work supervisor may not proctor an examination. Proctored exams may not be taken at the student's home or proctor's home. No proctor fees are authorized. NUNM academic directors or chairs reserve the right to reject any proctor. 2. The following individuals may serve as a volunteer proctor: A high school superintendent, principal, counselor or teacher A clergy member A faculty member (not teaching assistants) or administrator of an accredited university or college A head librarian A corporate education director Selected offices at NUNM, including t he applicable program 's director 3. Contact a volunteer proctor to request services, and submit the \"Proctor Identification\" form to an academic support administrator with the contact information, including the proctor's first and last name, title, business mailing address, business email address, and daytime phone number. 4. Once approved, the proctor will receive the student's examination(s) via email at their business location (a password is emailed to the proctor if the exam is taken online). 5. Exams must be taken within the date range specified and the student must arrange with the proctor a scheduled time to take the exam within the allowed block of time. 6. To take the exam, the student must present a photo ID such as a NUNM student ID card or driver's license , etc. 7. After the exam is complete, the proctor will authenticate the exam and then upload it for grading. To take an exam off campus: 1. A student may take an exam at a testing center, such as the National College Testing Association site: www.ncta -testing.o rg/cctc/find.php or proctoru.com. A test may have an additional charge. This is covered by the student. 40 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 2. Students may also find a volunteer proctor. The following individuals may proctor exams: A high school superintendent, principal, counselor or teacher A clergy member A faculty member (not teaching assistants) or administrator of an accredited university or college A head librarian A corporate education director Selected offices at NUNM, including the applicable program 's director The student will only need to identify a proctor once, unless the student needs to change proctors. If the student is registered for more than one online course requiring a proctored exam, a separate form for each course will be completed. 4.8 Religious Observance Policy The NUNM community is enriched by individuals of many faiths who have various religious observances, practices and beliefs. The university recognizes that, on some occasions, classes, exams, clinic shifts or other required academic activ ities may conflict with a student 's religious holiday observance. NUNM will work with the student to develop a reasonabl e accommodat ion. The following guidelines apply to all students who wish to miss or be excused from a clinical or academic requirement for a religious observance or restriction : 1. A student requesting to be exempt from requirements, or who seek s an academic modification , for religious observances must submit a written request to the Center for Academic Success the term prior to the requir ed academic activity that conflicts with the student 's religious observance. The Center for Academic Success will consider whether the requested accommodation would result in an undue hardship for staff, faculty, students or others in the NUNM community. 2. A student who is requesting to be absent from clinic rotations due to a religious holiday observance must follow the clinical excused absence policy in the Student C linic section , which includes notifying the faculty member, the associate registrar , and finding a substitute. See the Clinic Attendance and Absence Policies in the Student Clinic section for more information. 3. Requests to reschedule OSCE exams for religious observation purposes must be submitted the term prior to the quarter in which the OSCE is being held, due to the difficult nature of scheduling these exams. 4. Students requesting time off from classes to observe a religious holiday should refer to the corresponding absence policy. Students are encouraged to contact the director of academic success and access or the dean of students if they have any questions about religious holiday observance and these guidelines. Please see the absence policy in this handbook. An absence does not negate the student's responsibility for material o r assignments due during the period of absence. 4.9 Weeks 11 and 12 Policy During fall, winter and spring terms, instruction at NUNM is delivered in 12 -week quarters. As outlined in the course syllabi, faculty have the discretion to either hold classes during weeks 1 -10, reserving weeks 11 and 12 for review/testing \u2014OR deliver new material during all 12 weeks of 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 41 the course. If new material is delivered in all 12 weeks of the term, the final exam will be given on the last day of the course. If a class is c anceled during the first 10 weeks due to inclement weather, faculty illness, or other acceptable reasons, students should expect that missed material will be presented weeks 11 and 12. As material may need to be delivered during weeks 11 and 12, students a re expected to be available for makeup classes held during those weeks, even if all of their course syllabi denote week 11 and/or 12 as optional. SECTION 5: GRADING AND PROMOTION 5.1 Grading NUNM maintains high standards of scholarship and recognizes its responsibility to provide each student the best opportunity to complete their program(s) successfully. At the beginning of each course, the instructor is required to define clearly for class members the objectives of the course and the s tandards and methods by which student achievement will be measured. Students are responsible for regularly checking their grades online in Moodle and their final grades in SONIS. Courses that are graded using the \"P/F\" grading system are not included in a student's GPA. For students enrolled in the ND or CCM programs prior to fall 2015 , at the end of each course, each student's performance is repo rted to the registrar using a pass/fail grading system. For students enrolled in any program (fall 2015 or later) , at the end of each quarter, each student's course performance is reported to the registrar using the following letter grading system. A student's grade -point average will be calculated using the following chart: Grade Percentage Points A 90-100 4.0 B 80-89 3.0 C 70-79 2.0 D 60-69 1.0 F 59 or less 0.0 W/WF N/A Not calculated A (SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE): passing B (SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE): passing C (MARGINAL PERFORMANCE): passing D (UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE): not passing for graduate -level courses, passing for undergraduate F (FAILURE): not passing, permanent grade FR (FAIL REMEDIATE): marginal performance (temporary grade) . (Not available in the School of Undergraduate or School of Graduate Studies .) P (PASS): satisfactory performance ; equivalent to \"B\" or \"C\" H (HONORS): superior performance , equivalent to \"A\"; not available for all courses and only for those who started before 2015 W (WITHDRAWAL): student withdrew from course 42 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 WF (WITHDRAWAL, FAILING): student withdrew from course while failing I (INCOMPLETE): course requirements not yet completed, due only to serious illness or bereavement (temporary grade) T (TRANSFER): course received approved transfer credit. Tran sfer credit does not apply toward overall GPA calculation AU (AUDIT) IP (IN PROGRESS) R (REMEDIATION REQUIRED): marginal performance (temporary grade) - ND and CCM programs only RP (REMEDIATED PASS): grade given for a passed medical clinic rotation, bu t with required skills remediation - ND and CCM programs only RC (REMEDIATED C): pass remediation exam - ND and CCM programs only CMP (COMPLETE): used for courses that are not graded, but attendance is required and a specified number of hours need to be completed, such as preceptor hours NC (NOT COMPLETED): hour requirement or attendance not met 5.2 Grade of \" R/FR\" \u2014 ND/CCM only \"R\" (remediation required) or \"FR\" (fail remediate) is a temporary grade. Students who fail a course may receive an \" R/FR\" grade rather than an \" F\" (fail) , if they meet the criteria , and have the opportunity to take a remediation exam to pass the course. \"R\" grades are converted to either a n \"RC\" (remediated \"C\") if the remediation exam is passed or a \"D/F\" if the remediation exam is failed . \"FR\" grades are converted to either a n \"RP\" (remediated pass) or \"F\". A grade of \"R\" or \"FR\" cannot be converted to a \" P\" or an \"H.\" Grades of R/FR are not eligible for grade appeals. An R/ FR grade that has not been remediated by the end of the second week of the following term (for a spring term course by the end of the third week of summer term) will automatically be converted to an \"F.\" 5.3 Grade of \"RC/RP\" \u2014 ND/CCM only Students who pa ss a remediation exam will earn a permanent grade of \"RC (remediated \"C\") only ND: A permanent grade of \"RP\" will be given when an ND student passes a clinical rotation, but is required to attend a clinical skills enhancement course to attain an adequate level of clinical proficiency. An \"RP\" grade will also be given if a student receives a passing grade on a clinic rotation but was recommended for remediation more than once. CCM: Grades of \"RP\" are given when a supervisor believes a clinical weakness exists and has not been adequately improved upon by the end of the rotation. The CCM student will be required to remediate with either the director or the supervisor in order to attain an ad equate level of clinical proficiency. 5.4 Grade of \"D/F\" \u2014 Graduate Level For graduate -level students, a letter grade of \"D\" or \"F\" is considered a failing grade. A failing grade in a required course (including clinical rotations), requires the student to repeat the course/clinic rotation the next time it is offered, usually the next year. The student is prohibited 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 43 from continuing in any courses for which the failed course is a prerequisite. The student will repeat the course at the current per -credit rate. Any naturopathic student failing a clinical rotation will be required to register for and attend skills- building. If it is an elective course that is failed, the student is not required to retake it \u2014however, the student is strongly encouraged to do so as they will remain on probation and/or can trigger an academic suspension if further courses are failed. Grades received in repeated courses replace the grade originally obtained and are used to recalculate cumulative grade point average. 5.5 Grade of \"F\" \u2014 Undergraduate Level When an undergraduate -level student receives a fa iling grade, the course/rotation must be repeated the next time it is offered, usually the next year. The student is prohibited from continuing in any courses for which the failed course is a prerequisite. The student will repeat the course at the current per -credit rate. Grades received in repeated courses replace the grade originally obtained and are used to recalculate cumulative grade point average. 5.6 Grade of \"I\" When a student cannot complete a course in the term in which it begins, an incomplete (\"I\") grade may be considered. The granting of an \"I\" grade is at the discretion of the faculty member and used in exceptional circumstances. Faculty may consider the grade of \"I\" petition when the following criteria have been met: The student has satisfa ctorily completed a minimum of 80% of the course requirements; and The student is passing the course; and The student is unable to complete the course during the term the course is offered. While these criteria must be met, their fulfillment does not entitle students to an incomplete grade. The instructor of a course has the final decision regarding appropriate award ing of an \"I\" grade and may make exceptions to the above criteria. To request an incomplete grade, the student is responsible for contact ing the faculty of the course (ND students should contact the course director for that block) to discuss the circumstances around why the student is unable to complete the course during the term the course is offered. If approved, the student is responsible for submitting to the Registrar's Office an approved \"Grade of Incomplete Petition\" form, which can be obtained from the Registrar's Office or the Center for Academic Success. To complete the form, a student must: Meet with the faculty member to complete the form and discuss the remaining course assignments to be submitted to change the grade of \"I\"; and Use the supplemental worksheet attached to the \"Grade of Incomplete Petition\" form to create a timeline for completion of course requirements; and Return the completed petition form to the Registrar's Office. A grade of incomplete should be completed within the first two weeks of the next term in which the student is enrolled, with an extension of no more than two quarters. Failure to complete the required co urse work by the timeline on the contract will result in a failing grade. 44 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 When the student completes the work required to change the \"I\" grade, the faculty member will submit the \"Grade Change\" form to the Registrar's Office. If a grade of \"I\" extends beyond two (2) quarters due to ongoing circumstances, the student may be required to take a leave of absence and will be allowed to complete the course material upon return from leave. Students who apply for a leave of absence and have not completed 80% of the coursework will receive a grade of \"W\" for the class, and will need to repeat it upon return from leave. A withdrawal will affect the student's ability to continue in certain course sequences in subsequent quarters. Multiple \"I\" grades in one quarter may result in the inability to petition for incomplete grades the subsequent quarter. A student requesting a grade of \"I\" in a course that is a prerequisite for a subsequent course may not enroll in the subsequent course until the grade of \"I\" is resolved or complete a petition to deviate (see the Deviation Policy ). Registration may be denied for a student's final professional field experience (e.g., fieldwork, internship, capstone, etc.) if an \"I\" grade has not been resolved. Incomplete grades are not i ncluded when calculating GPA or total credits completed; however, \"I\" grades may affect a student's satisfactory academic progress. Students requesting \"I\" grades should meet with the Financial Aid Office to examine the effects on their financial aid award . An incomplete will not be awarded when a student is failing a course for the purpose of giving additional time to complete late assignments. Any student who is failing a course after week eight is not eligible to request an \"I.\" Students who beli eve they have a disability in class or clinic are encouraged to contact the Center for Academic Success to discuss potential accommodations. Grade of \"I\" - Graduate -Level Clinical Rotations A grade of \"I\" will be given to students who are passing a clinical r otation but have missed up to 2 shifts (8 hours) during an 11 - or 12- week term. Students must make up any missed shifts by the end of the following term in order to convert an \"I\" grade to a \"P.\" If missed shifts are not made up by the deadline, an \"I\" gra de will convert to an \"F.\" See the Clinic section of the student handbook for more detail. Students who beli eve they have a disability in class or clinic are encouraged to contact the Center for Academic Success to discuss potential accommodations. 5.7 Grade of \"CMP\" This grade (complete) is used for courses that the student is required to attend, but no evaluation is given. Examples of such courses include, but may not be limited to, ND Preceptorships, community education or new student orientation, for which the student is required to complete a certain number of hours. 5.8 Grade of \"IP\" This grade designates a course is in progress; temporary grade. Once the faculty member submits the grades, the \"IP\" grade will be cha nged to the appropriate rating. 5.9 Grade of \"W\" \"W\" ( withdrawal) is a grade used to indicate that a student has withdrawn from a course. A \"W\" is recorded on a student's transcript but not included in GPA calculation. A \"W\" grade is, 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 45 however, considered part of the courses attempted c alculation as per the satisfactory academic progress policy. 5.10 Remediation \u2014 ND and CCM Students who receive an \"R/FR \" are eligible to sit for remediation exams and/or projects . All remediation exams and/or projects must be completed and grade changes submitted to the Registrar's Office by the end of week two (2) of the following term (spring term grades have until week three of summer term). For students who receive an \" R/FR \" grade in spring quarter and have already made verifiable travel plans that interfere with this remediation schedule, they may, with the approval of the ir progra m's director , be allowed to complete the remediation by the last week of the summer term. ND Program ND students who earn a 67 -69% ( \"D\" range or \" R/FR \" grade) in lecture courses are eligible to remediate a final exam. Labs and tutorial courses may offer remediation exams at instructor discretion, based on the course material and the feasibility of offering a remediation exam. An \"R\" grade will be recorded on their transcript until a remediation exam has been taken and a permanent grade is entered into SONIS. In order to have the \"R\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus. CCM Programs CCM students who earn a 60 -69% (\"D\" range) for their final grade may be eligible to remediate a final exam if, in the judgment of the instructor, it is likely that the student could pass the course by successfully taking a remediation exam. An \"R\" or \"FR\" grade will be recorded on thei r transcript until a remediation exam has been taken and a permanent grade is entered into SONIS. In order to have the \"R\" or \"FR\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus. 5.11 Clinical Remediation Students who require extra support in meeting minimal levels of clinical competency are counseled and referred for additional instruction by their clinical supervisors or the school/ college director . ND Clinical Skills Enhancement Tutorial Clinical skills enhancement courses are generally scheduled over a nine -week period of time; students may be referred to this course at any point during the term. The clinical skills enhancement instructor carefully assesses each student's abilities and wo rks with them directly throughout the duration of the course. At the end of the course, the instructor reassesses the student's abilities and determines if the student should continue with the course. A faculty member may require or recommend a clinical sk ills enhancement course, even if a student receives a passing grade, if the faculty member feels the student needs additional help to remain on track in their clinical education. When a ND student receives two or more grades of \"Pass with Clinical Skills Enhancement Recommended\" during their academic career, the clinical skills enhancement course becomes a requirement and the student will be registered for it the n ext term. ND Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) Tutorial An ND student who f ails an OSCE exam twice will be referred to an OSCE Skills Tutorial for three sessions, and a failing grade will be recorded on their transcript. Upon successful completion of the OSCE Tutorial, the student must then register to retake the OSCE exam. 46 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Any student who fails an OSCE exam three times will be placed on academic suspension. CCM Clinical Skills Remediation Clinic al evaluations of CCM student performance are done during week six (6) of the term to provide feedback and identify areas of weakness, including those that must be remediated before the end of term in order for the student to pass the clinic rotation. The clinical supervisor, in collaboration with the CCM director , can assig n remediation work, which can include attendance at weekly clinical skills tutorial labs run by a CCM resident. CCM Clinical Entrance Examination All CCM students take a practical point location examination at the beginning of the winter quarter prior to starting their internship year. Students failing this examination are given the opportunity to remediate this exam later in the same term. If the student fails the remediation exam, they must enroll in the Advanced Point Location course in the spring quart er. CCM students also take a written clinic entrance examination during the first half of the spring term prior to becoming an intern. The written examination covers the foundational course material needed to assume responsibility for direct patient care. Students who fail this examination are given the opportunity to remediate the exam later in the same term. A remediation fee is applied. Should a student fail the written examination for a second time, their entrance into the clinic is delayed for a term, during which the student will have time to address weak areas. Another written exam will be given toward the end of this term. 5.12 Grade Appeals Students have the right to appeal a failing grade if they perceive that there has been an error in the grading procedure, or if there is a perceived lack of clarity about the faculty member's expectation for passing a course. The appeal must be made within two weeks of receipt of the grade . Grades of \"B\" or better cannot be appealed to receive a higher grade or a grade of \"honors. \" A student may request a review of a grade given in an exam or a final grade for a course only in the following manner : A written request by the student, for a review of the grade, must be submitted to the faculty member. This appeal must be within two weeks of the posted grade. The faculty member will advise the student in writing of the decision within seven days of rece ipt of the request. The student may appeal the faculty member's decision in writing via a \"Grade Appeal \" form. The completed appeal form will be submitted to the registrar . This appeal must be made within seven days of the faculty member's written notice to the student regarding the decision. The written appeal to the registrar must be accompanied by appropriate written documentation as to why the student feels the grade is in error, and what the outcome was of the discussion and appeal with the faculty m ember. The registrar will forward the appeal to the Academic Appeal and Review Committee (ARAC) . ARAC will review the documentation , may have a discussion with the faculty member , and issue a recommendation to the appropriate academic director (s) or designee . The recommendations from ARAC may include upholding the grade as submitted or requiring the student to remediate an exam. ARAC may not recommend a passing grade to be substituted in place of a failing grade. The director (s) or designee will revie w the recommendations and make a final decision. The student and faculty member will be notified in writing of the final decision. The decision is final and may not be appealed to higher authority. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook Exam Appeals students who have a non -passing f irst OSCE exam result may not appeal , since a failing grade is not given until the second exam attempt is unsuccessful . A failed second attempt OSCE exam grade appeal must b e submitted to the director of the College of Naturopathic Medicine within two (2) weeks of the posted grade , and will be referred to the Clinic Promotions Committee f or review . The c ommittee will notify the student in writing of the decision within 14 days of receipt of the request. SECTION 6: TECHNICAL STANDARDS AND STUDENT PRACTICE 6.1 NUNM Technical Standards NUNM Technical Standards and Expectations Health sciences programs have a societal responsibility to train competent graduates, healthcare providers and scientists that demonstrate critical judgment, extensive knowledge and well honed technical skills. Students and graduates are engaging in a career in a profession that requires the highest standards of ethical conduct , honesty , and professionalism. NUNM students are expected to conduct themselves in accord ance with the high ethical standards expected of professionals who may be required to assume responsibility for the life , health, and wellbeing of others. Every student is expected to demonstrate a level of competence consistent with these professional responsi bilities and NUNM has the right to discipline, suspend or expel, at any time, any student considered unfit for a career as a professional , in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in in the university student handbook.

These skills req uire the use of vision, hearing and touch, or the fun ctional equivalent. Professional Responsibilities Demonstrate the ability to meet the ethical and legal standards of the profession. 6.2 Academic Freedom NUNM faculty and students are free to question, discover and test all knowledge appropriate to their discipline as judged by the academic community in general. 6.3 Student Practice Policy Being a student of medical student carries with it a professional responsibility. To the general community, students are a representative of NUNM and the professi on. To maintain high standards for quality, the following policies apply to each student enrolled at NUNM: NUNM defines \"practicing medicine without a license\" as diagnosing, treating, advising and advertising without licensed supervision or licensure. For professions that are regulated by Oregon state licensure (including medicine, acupuncture, massage, etc.): No NUNM student shall practice, advertise to practice, or accept compensation of any type for practicing these professions unless the student has obtained the required license in the state of Oregon. For healing modalities that are not licensed in Oregon (iridology, herbalism, homeopathy, etc.): No NUNM student shall practice medicine, advertise to practice, or accept compensation of any type for prac ticing any unlicensed healing or diagnostic modality. Students shall not offer their status as an NUNM student as a qualification to perform healthcare modalities, except within the scope of university -approved programs under the direct supervision of prof essionals recognized and appointed as supervisors by NUNM. Students are allowed to practice skills enhancement of techniques learned as part of their curriculum. 50 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 A violation of the above policies will subject the student to sanctions set forth in the Stud ent Conduct Code, including suspension from NUNM. 6.4 Students as Patients Policy Students as Patients\u2014ND and Nutrition Programs In the event of down time on a clinic shift, students who are registered on that shift may act as a patient in the following circumstances. The foundational principle is that students at NUNM should not feel pressured or receive inducement to participate a s a simulated or actual patient, and may only \"opt in.\" 1. Scenario 1 - Role Playing a. If the student is portraying a case/condition/presentation that is not their own (i.e., they are role -playing), the case may be taken in a non -private/group setting. b. A stude nt who opts in to participate may change their mind at any time without having to explain themselves. c. Even in this situation, there is risk of harm; for example, if the scenario is similar to a student's past experiences or triggers past trauma. This risk of harm cannot be anticipated in advance, thus a standard participation consent must be completed prior to commencing. This consent form will stipulate that there are potential harms and that the student accepts this risk and may cancel their opt -in withou t cause and without fear of negative consequence. 2. Scenario 2 - Portraying Own Case a. If the student has a medical condition and opts in to having a real visit, they may be added to the clinic schedule; and must be treated as an actual clinic patient, with al l HIPAA, informed consent, and medical documentation policies in place. The doctor -patient relationship must be clear and established, and discussion of the dual roles/power differential this creates (doctor and supervisor) should occur. Students as Patients\u2014CCM A student participating in a clinic rotation may serve as a patient on that rotation on an as -needed basis according to the following parameters: 1. All students must be informed that when a supervisor of a shift treats them as a patient on the same shift, the nature of their relationship fundamentally changes in a manner that the student may not anticipate and in ways the student cannot always understand at the time. 2. The student must be reminded of this change in relationship prior to any formal treatment being delivered, and must sign an informed consent in which this information is included. 3. The student may not schedule the visit in advance, but rather during the shift when there is an open slot or patient no -show. The student will sign a relea se of information form stipulating: a. The extent of treatment (e.g., general/extensive vs. limited/condition -specific) b. The condition to be treated (if condition -specific), e.g., back pain c. That the student is aware they are under no obligation to divulge information they are uncomfortable sharing. 4. That the student knows they may elect to end the interview and/or treatment at any time. The visit will be formally scheduled at the clinic front desk and charted in EPIC using the dot phrase for abbreviated visits. The dot phrase includes billing for one unit of acupuncture (97810) and no more. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Note: a \"point lab,\" in which an instructor demonstrates how to needle one or more points, is not considered a formal treatment and is not subject to the same stipulations as a formal treatment as described above. 5. A student volunteering to be treated on shift in a formal capacity cannot be seen for a new patient visit. The student's case will be discussed, as long as the above is observed, according to the shift structure, as follows: a. For observation rotation shifts, the case will be discussed by all participants. b. For clinical mentoring rotation shifts, the case will be discussed by all participants. c. For intern shifts, the case will be discussed by the treating intern(s) and t he supervisor. Students as Patients\u2014MSiMH Students in the MSiMH program may not serve as patients during MSiMH clinic shifts. 6.5 Human Models for Instruction As part of the education of our students, there are various times when genital examinations or other sensitive examinations must be performed. NUNM will hire models for the learning exercises from fees paid by all students. 6.6 Intellectual Property and Copyrights NUNM policy states that copyright remains with a student author or creator unless th e work is a work -done -for-hire. A work -done -for-hire is one that is supported by direct allocation of funds by NUNM for the pursuit of a specific project; is commissioned by NUNM; makes significant use of university resources or personnel; and/or is otherw ise subject to a contractual obligation. NUNM does not claim ownership in pedagogical, scholarly or artistic works, regardless of their form of expression, including the works of students created in the course of their education, such as dissertations, pa pers and articles. NUNM claims no ownership for nonfiction, novels, textbooks, poems, musical compositions, pictorial and graphic works, software or other original works that are not university works, and which make no significant use of university resourc es or of the services of NUNM staff working within the scope of their employment. Students also retain copyright ownership for their contributions to online and/or hybrid courses that use Moodle as a tool for classroom participation. However, NUNM reserves the right to archive technology mediated course materials (Moodle courses, for example) and preserve the contributions of NUNM students. It is expected that students will agree to the practice of archiving their contributions to Moodle courses whe n they have signed and agreed to the Honor Code. All use of notes, audio and visual recordings are for students' personal learning purposes and professional reference only, and cannot be redistributed in any format. This policy applies to written, audio, visual or any electronic materials, including when a student makes a personal recording of a faculty member or lecture. Written, audio, visual or any electronic materials may not be used for marketing, teaching or publication without written permission fro m the faculty member. Notes from a faculty member cannot be published in a book, manuscript, blog or in any other form. If materials are used outside the course, express written permission must be granted from the lecturer or faculty member. Audio or visua l recordings of a faculty member or guest lecturer require written permission, received in advance, from that individual each term. 52 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Permission forms are available on the NUNM website and Moodle. Signed permission forms will be kept in the student's academi c file. If a student uses phrases, graphs, logos, photographs or drawings from published material, it must reference the original source o r it will be deemed plagiarism. Violation of copyright and/or plagiarism will be subject to disciplinary sanctions as described in the Code of Conduct (refer to the student handbook). SECTION 7: CHANGE OF TRACK , CHANGE OF DEGREE, AND GRADUATION 7.1 Change of Track Students are admitted to a specific program and on a specific track ( i.e., 2-year MScN , 5-year ND, 4 -year Students are required to follow their e ducational track and are not allowed to drop required courses and/or take required courses ahead of schedule. After matriculation, students may request to change tracks to any of the standard educational tracks by contacting the Center for Academic Success. Once processed, students must follow their new educational track. All track requests must be completed by week eight of the quarter prior to the quarter in which the change takes effect. Due to the timing of some deviations or track changes, a student may lose their full -time status. Adjustments to individual tracks may be required due to course conflicts. Students who deviate from their approved educational track may be required to take a leave of absence or fall under a new course catalog curriculum. 7.2 Deviation A student may request to deviate from a standard educational track for the following reasons: 1. Pre-approved and documented disability accommodation (co ntact the director of academic success and access for more information) 2. Leave of absence/withdrawal 3. Transfer credits 4. Failure of a required course 5. Adding a second program 6. Scheduling conflicts between required courses (including, but not limited to, a previous deviation, failed courses, being enrolled in multiple programs, etc.) Future adjustments to individual layouts may be required due to course conflicts created by the original approved curriculum modification(s). Some deviations or curriculum mod ifications may also r esult in the student not meeting full-time status; therefore , a Petition to Deviate also requires a signature from the Financial Aid Office, since there is a likelihood of award mod ification . Students petitioning curriculum modifications or deviations fr om policy must submit their requests no later than the end of week two of the term before the request would take effect. Exceptions to this will be made if: A course is cancelled that was previously confirmed by the institution A request is based on infor mation that was not known prior to the deadline (additional documentation may be required) 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 53 A situation that is deemed an emergency by the director of academic success and access and/or designee Requested changes may not compromise established curriculum p olicies or affect minimum or maximum required numbers (i.e., clinical rotations, preceptorships/internships, electives). Deviation requests must be accompanied by the appropriate documentation before approval can be given. Students seeking to deviate from their standard educational track are required to meet with the Center for Academic Success to discuss options and approval; if the reason for the request is outside the identified areas, students may appeal to the Petition Review Board Students approved for deviations must maintain institutional and financial aid Satisfactory Academic Progress within their program (s) and the institution (see the catalog for details ). Deviations or modifications to curriculum may also delay advancement in courses, qualifi cation for licensure board exams, OSCE, etc. NUNM is not liable for delays or financial implications. 7.3 Change/Addition of Degree(s) Students who wish to add an additional degree (i.e., become a concurrently enrolled student in two degree programs) or change the degree in which they are enrolled must formally apply through the Office of Admissions. If admitted, the Office of Admissions will inform the student, the Center for Academic Success, and the Registrar's Office. The student will work with the Center for Academic Success to establish a new curriculum layout , if needed . Students must meet with the Office of Financial Aid, since there is likelihood of award modification. Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress in their origi nal program may not be aid eligible for their new program. Students who matriculate into a second degree program will do so under the catalog corresponding to the year in which the student begins the new degree. See the handbook sections regarding challenge exams and transfer credit petitioning . Students may pursue no more than two degrees concurrently. Students who wish to change their degree (i.e., not become a concurrently enrolled , but switch entirely) will also be required to formally withdraw through the Center for Academic Success. 7.4 Graduation Requirements Candidates for graduation must complete the following within the same calendar year as the commencement ceremony they participate in : Satisf y all courses in the degree program curriculum Satisfy clinic requirements, if applicable to the student's degree program Demonstrate competence in all t echnical standards For clinical degree students, d emonstrate satisfactory professionalism for a health professional If a transfer student enrolled in a clinical program , at least three years of professional training must be completed as an enrolled as a student at NUNM If a second professional degree stu dent, complete at least two years of professional training enrolled as a student at NUNM Satisfy thesis or capstone project if required for degree 54 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Satisfy all financial obligations to NUNM A diploma will not be issued to students until all clinical, academic and financial requirements have been met.

Any student who completes , or is projected to complete , their degree requirements in the same calendar year may participate in the commencement ceremony . All students mus t submit a \"Petition to Graduate\" form by end of fall term prior to the calendar year they anticipate graduating. Participation in a commencement ceremony does not indicate a fulfil lment of all degree requirements resulting in a diploma . A diploma will no t be issued to students until all clinical, academic and financial requirements have been met \u2014regardless of participation in a commencement ceremon y. ND students are ineligible to sit for clinical licensure examinations until all required work is completed. MSOM and DSOM students are not eligible for licensure until all required work is completed. All Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements, as noted in the handbook, are in effect for students who are participating in commencement but have not yet completed all requirements for degree completion . Students who do not complete their graduation requirements by the end of spring term must submit a \"Status Change\" form to extend beyond spring term. Students who fail to complete graduation requirem ents by the end of the spring term must remain registered for a minimum of one credit to maintain student status. Students who have registered and paid for all required courses and electives will need to register each term for a graduation completion cours e (one credit) or thesis /capstone completion ( one credit) until they have completed their requirements (students will not be aid -eligible at this point). Students may take one additional year to complete their degree requirements from projected date of gra duation. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 55 Any student who does not enroll in a minimum of one credit each quarter will be subject to an administrative withdrawal and the reapplication process through the Admissions Office. Any student who is reapplying will be subject to all degree requi rements in place at that t ime if readmission is granted. SECTION 8: ADVISING, LEAVE OF ABSENCE, WITHDRAWAL 8.1 Academic Advising The Center for Academic Success administers academic advising for all students. Students who are pursuing any track other than the standard published tracks must confer with the Center for Academic Success to ensure all requirements are met. Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress are required to meet with the Center for Academic Success. The Center for Academic Success is responsible for advising students on the following: Academic probation (meet with all students on academic probation) Changing tracks (four - to five -year, etc.) Leave of absences or withdrawing from a program Questions regarding concur rent track options Assistance with the grade appeals process General questions regarding academic progress and success 56 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 8.2 Advising and Support Chart The Advising and Support Chart is a guide to what departments, specific contacts and further description of resources to students on campus.

Students wishing to take less than a full academic year off may not be allowed to continue with a full class load due to the sequencing of courses and prerequisites. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track that must be approv ed by the Center for Academic Success and/or their school/ college director. The Center for Academic Success will guide students through the new curriculum requirements. Students who take a leave of absence or withdraw during the term will earn a grade of \"W.\" If the student withdraws with 80% or more completion of the course, the student may be eligible to petition the faculty member for an incomplete grade ( see the Incomplete P olicy) . Students who are on a leave of absence or withdrawn cannot participate in any academic activities, including remediating incomplete grades or exams, and/or participating in clinical rotation shifts, including preceptor rotations . For students concurrently enrolled in two programs, who wish to take a leave from their primary program only and to continue the series of courses in their secondary program for the remainder of the academic year, the following conditions apply: There may not be an option of continuing in their secondary degree program at a full - time status, nor adding core (required) courses due to prerequisites and requirements of the program Concurrent students who elect to continue in their secondary degree program while on a leave of absence from their primary program may continue to receive Title IV financia l aid, however their eligibility may change and students will need to meet with the Office of Financial Aid to discuss these changes. The Center for Academic Success must be advised of a student's intention to return to NUNM prior to 30 days of intended r eturn, and before the beginning of the quarter for which the student plans to register. If a student does not return within one year, the student will be considered administratively withdrawn from NUNM and will be required to submit a new application for admission. The student will need to satisfy admission requirements in effect at the time of reapplication, but may request that the application fee be waived. Students are not allowed to take more than one year (four quarters) of absence from NUNM durin g their academic career. 8.4 Involuntary Leave of Absence This policy is designed to maintain the health and safety of all campus community members. A student may be restricted from campus or subject to an involuntary leave of absence when, due to a menta l, emotional, physical or psychological health disorder, their continued presence at the university poses a significant risk of substantial harm to themselves or others, or is creating a substantial disruption to the educational environment . A significant risk is based upon an individualized assessment and constitutes a high probability of substantial harm that cannot be mitigated by reasonable means. If a student has taken actions that are identified as being a significant risk to the health or safety of oneself or others, or is creating a substantial disruption to the educational environment; the 58 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 dean of students (or designee) acting on behalf of NUNM and in consultation with the Crisis Assessment and REsponse Team (CARE Team), may initiate the ILOA proce ss as set forth below. The significant risks may include, but are not limited to, acute danger/loss of life, inability to independently manage daily tasks, or inability to cooperate with necessary support services, etc. If the decision is made to place th e student on an ILOA, the student is prohibited from participating in any academic or non -academic NUNM activities, including remediating incomplete grades or exams, and/or participating in clinical rotations and preceptor rotations. The student may be sub jected to actions including, but not limited to: A temporary ban from campus; Withdrawal from class attendance or experiential learning (i.e., preceptor rotations, community education, university- sponsored travel, etc.); An interim suspension of participat ion in any campus or off -campus NUNM activities; Completion of a mental health, substance abuse, or other necessary evaluation conducted by an appropriate off -campus licensed health provider Students will receive a written description of the details of the ILOA pertaining to them, including the appeal procedures as outlined in the student handbook. The letter regarding the ILOA will be placed in the student's file with a copy sent to the student's school/ college director(s), director of academic success and access, registrar, director of financial aid, administrative dean, and the office of the chief academic officer . The Registrar's Office will notify course instructors of the student's leave status. A student who wishes to return from an ILOA must provide to the dean of students ( or designee) adequate documentation as outlined in the initial letter from the attending physician or mental health professional demonstrating the student's fitness for returning to NUNM. Students taking less than a full academic year off may find, upon their return, that the appropriate course load required to stay on track will not qualify them for full- time financial aid. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track, which must be appr oved by the Center for Academic Success. Students who are placed on an ILOA will earn a grade of \"W\" for enrolled courses at the time the leave is instated. If the student has completed at least 80% of the course at the time of the withdrawal, they may be eligible to petition the faculty member f or a grade of \"Incomplete.\" See the grading policy in the student handbook. 8.5 Withdrawal from School Students may initiate formal withdrawal by meeting with the Center for Academic Success. Students withdrawing from school at any time during the school year must complete an exit interview with the Office of Financial Aid and submit a completed \"Leave/Withdrawal\" form to the Registrar's Office. Failure to attend for any quarter is considered a withdrawal, and the student will need to submit a new applica tion and application fee for readmission. Students who withdraw from NUNM during the course of a term will earn a grade of \"W.\" A student facing an alleged violation of the Code of Conduct or Honor Code may be permitted to withdraw from NUNM, however, proc eedings will continue in their NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 59 Withdrawals - Federal Title IV Aid Recipients If a student ceases attendance (drops or withdraws) from all Title IV eligible courses in a payment period or a period of enrollment, the student is considered withdr awn for Federal Title IV aid purposes; and may not take a leave of absence to complete additional programs. 8.6 Federal Loan Exit Interviews Federal regulations require that any student who has received a federal loan while attending NUNM and who leaves for any reason, including official leaves of absence, must participate in a loan exit interview. Exit interviews are conducted online at : studentaid.gov/app/counselingInstructions.action?counselingType=exit . Additional information may be obtained by calling the Financial Aid Office. SECTION 9: DRUG -FREE CAMPUS 9.1 Observance of Acts, Laws and Rules NUNM is committed to prov iding a drug -free environment. Alcohol and/or drug abuse compromises the student's ability to learn and to practice as a health provider and thus is considered unprofessional conduct. In compliance with the Drug- Free Schools and Communities Act, as amended by Public Law 100-297, and the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, Public Law 103- 382, the federal Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Administrative Rules 409- 030-0100, NUNM is legally required and professionally committed to prevent illicit or recreational drug use and the abuse of alcohol by both students and employees. 9.2 Illicit Drug and Alcohol Policy Students are prohibited from unlawfully possessing, using or distri buting , or be under the influence of or inebriated by alcohol or drugs, whether prescribed, illicit, or used recreationally , or any other intoxicant on university property or at any university event. The sale or transfer of prescription and look -a-like dru gs is also a violation of university policy. Students and employees are also prohibited from consuming alcohol or drugs on campus or at NUNM -sponsored events, (except when the event i s authorized by special permit; s ee the Exemption Request for Alcohol at University Events and Receptions Policy ) or from being on university- controlled property while under the influence of alcohol or intoxicants . In addition, students may not attend class or clinic under the effect of alcohol or drugs. Violation of this policy by a student will result in sanctions up to, and including, suspension or expulsion from NUNM and referral for prosecution for violation of local, state and federal laws. If state and federal law differ in establishing which drugs are illegal, NUNM follows federal law in determining whether a substance is illicit. Any s tudent found in violation of this policy may be subject to sanctions as set forth in the Student Conduct Code. 9.3 Drugs/Intoxicant Violation Any student believed to have any detectable amount of alcohol or drugs in their system , whether prescribed, illicit , recreational, and/ or any other intoxicant , may be required to undergo a rapid urinary drug screen (RUDS). If the RUDS is found to be positi ve, the results will be confirmed by a second testing method completed at a DHHS -certified lab. If this testing also shows \"positive,\" the student will be removed from class or clinic shift and subject to sanctions as set forth in the Code of Conduct. 60 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 If the RUDS demonstrates the presence of a prescription drug, a valid prescription for the drug must be provided, and disciplinary measures may be invoked if the student is visibly inebriated or suffering cognitive impairment while on the medication. The university 's initial and foremost response to reported or observed violation is counseling in and conjunction with other disciplinary actions. 9.4 Alcohol Violation Any student whom NUNM has reasonable grounds to believe is intoxicated will be required to undergo a blood alcohol test that will be administered at a facility designated by NUNM . Refusal to take this blood alcohol test can result in immediate suspension from NUNM . If the student is working a clinic shift, having a test that show s any alcohol in the student 's system will result in immediate removal from the clinic shift and subject to sanctions as set forth in the Code of Conduct. 9.5 Legal Consequences There are both state and federal sanctions regarding the possession or distribution of illegal drugs. Oregon has strong laws that allow the seizure and forfeiture of vehicles used to transport illegal drugs by law enforcement agencies. Alcohol is an illegal drug for those under age 21. For drivers under age 18, any detectable amount of alcohol is grounds for losing an operator's license until age 18. Most \"recreational\" drugs are illegal , and criminal conviction may bar a student from their chosen career path. 9.6 Education and Rehabilitation Students who may be having difficulty with alcohol and/or drugs are encouraged t o seek appropriate counseling. In addition, in compliance with federal law, NUNM is prepared to educate and inform its students and employees of the health risks associated wit h the use of various illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol. NUNM is also prepared to refer students to counseling and treatment resources, and to inform students of legal penalties of noncompliance. Students are encouraged to avail themselves of an approp riate counseling, treatment or rehabilitation program. NUNM aims to share concern for those struggling with substance abuse and support their decision to enter counseling or recovery programs. Even so, drug and/or alcohol use and abuse is not tolerated on campus because of the inevitabl e effects on others. Resources concerning treatment and rehabilitation programs are available in the Office of Student Life. University officials may consider a student's participation in such a program when applying sancti ons for violations of this policy. 9.7 Drug Testing In compliance with the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Administrative Rules 409- 030- 0100, as of July 1, 2015, all incoming graduate students (campus- based) are required to undergo a drug screen prior to matriculation at NUNM . Students enrolled prior to July 1, 2015, are required to undergo a drug screen prior to any clinical rotations or field -work experience. Incoming students must submit a urine sample a t a Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) -certified lab in the 30 days prior to the beginning of their NUNM matriculation date. Refusal to take the required substance test may result in a revocation of the offer of admission to NUNM . The student w ill forfeit the enrollment deposit. Students are responsible for paying for the drug screening when they arrive at the lab. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 61 Currently enrolled students may be required to undergo a drug screening prior to their first clinical rotation or field work exper ience. Refusal to take the required substance test may result in an interim suspension from NUNM and a referral to Honor Council, and will prohibit the student from participating in clinical rotations or fieldwork at NUNM or any of its affiliates . The 10-panel urinary drug screen must include t he following eight substances: a mphetamine hencyclidine. incoming students, a refusal to take the req uired substance test may result in a revocation of the offer of admission to NUNM . For current students, a refusal to take the required substance test may result in an interim suspension from NUNM , which prohibits the student fr om participating in courses, clinical rotations, or fieldwork at NUNM or any of its affiliates. Drug Screening Results for Current Students Students who receive a urinary drug screen that is \"dilute -positive ,\" \"dilute -negative ,\" \"positive \" or \"invalid\" in any way, are sent to a Medical Review Officer (MRO), an independent third -party licensed physician who is responsible for receiving and reviewing lab results generated by the urinary drug screen process. The MRO will contact only student s with a test result other than a negative screening result. A prescription for any medications that may appear on the 10 -panel urinary drug screen can be submitted to the MRO. NUNM does not accept medical prescriptions for marijuana. Any urinary drug scre en result that is ,\" -negative ,\" \"positive \" any way\u2014 is considered void /invalid . The student is responsible to take a subsequent drug test within 30 days of the void /invalid result. The student will be put on interim c linical suspension until a negative drug result is received. Failure to complete a subsequent urinary drug screen within this time period will result in clinical suspension and a referral to Honor Council. Students who have had a void or invalid drug scr een may be required to undergo a rapid urinary drug screen (RUDS) at any point during their academic or clinical career, with or without cause. If the RUDS is found to be positive, the results will be confirmed by a second testing method completed at a DHH S-certified lab. If this testing also shows \"positive,\" the student will be removed from class or clinic shift and subject to sanctions as set forth in the Code of Conduct. Refusal to take the required substance test may result in an interim suspension fr om NUNM and will prohibit the student from participating in classes, clinical rotations, or fieldwork at NUNM or any of its affiliates. Possession of marijuana, in any quantity, on any NUNM property or during classes, clinical rotations, or fieldwork is against NUNM policy and federal law. In addition, failure to comply with federal laws and regu lations on marijuana possession and use on campus jeopardizes the university's continued receipt of federal funds. Thus, NUNM does not accept medical prescriptions for marijuana. Costs Students will be financially responsible for all drug screening fees. For current students, the lab fee for the urinary drug screenings will be added to each student's account. 62 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Record Retenti on The Office of the Chief Medical Officer will maintain a database recording that the student has complied with all clinical entry requirements stipulated in OAR 409 -030-0100. This information can be shared with affiliated hospitals, clinics, and fieldw ork sites that request this information to prevent students from having to comply with further drug testing at their facility and to assure affiliated hospitals, clinics, and fieldwork sites that the student has complied with the policy. Students who wish this information to be released to affiliated hospitals, clinics, and fieldwork sites can submit a \"Release of Information \" form to the Chief Medical Officer's Office. If a student receives a positive result from the confirmatory drug screening, the repo rt will be forwarded to the d ean of student s for review and referral to the Honor Council. 9.8 Exemption Policy for Request for Alcohol at University Events and Receptions NUNM complies with the Drug -Free Work Act of 1988 , the Drug- Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989 , and State of Oregon laws. NUNM prohibits the consumption or distribution of alcohol on university properties, whether or not it is an NUNM -sponsored event , and at off -site university sponsored events . A student organization or department that would like to request an exemption to the no alcohol policy for an event , may petition the appropriate office for exemption by submitting a n \"NUNM Alcohol Exemption\" form. This applies to all university- sponsored events on- or off -campus. Exception for special consideration for exemption to this policy must be made no less than two weeks prior to the event date to the appropriate office, and if approved, all delineated requirements must be met. Any person or or ganization who wishes to have an event with alcohol , and petitions for exemption , must designate an e vent host.

The event host shall read, understand and agree to all policies and procedures, as well as submit the \"NUNM Alcohol Exemption\" form for approval a minimum of two weeks prior to the event. All requests for exemption for alcohol require at least three sign atures for final approval. In cases of events at which students are present, approval is required by the dean of students (or designee ); in cases of institutional or departmental events at which staff or faculty are present, approval by the director of hum an resources is required. If students and employees are present, both the director of human resources and the dean of students (or designee ) must approve the form. In cases of non -NUNM events, approval is by the vice president of finance and administration (or designee ). The Office of Security and the Office of the President must also sign off on all petitions for final approval.

Servers will not consume alcohol while working, nor serve more than one alcohol beverage to a single person at one time. 10. NUNM employees shall not c onsume alcohol unless they have completed their normal work schedule. This is in compliance with the Drug- Free Workplace Act. 11. Sponsoring groups who wish to provide alcohol at events sponsored by the university or on university property must designate an e vent host. The e vent host is responsible for the submission of the \"NUNM Alcohol Exemption\" f orm for approval to the approving body no fewer than two weeks prior to the event. Failure to comply with the deadline may result in denial of permit. 12. The event host may not consume alcohol during the event to ensure all policies, procedures, regulations and laws are being followed. 13. No alcohol will be sold on university properties unless the events are catered through food service and have been approved through the NUNM process. NUNM does not hold a liquor license. The food service provider must apply for and receive a Temporary Sales License through the Oregon Liquor Control Commission office (OLCC).

All members of the NUNM community participate by committing to, and agreeing to, uphold the Honor Code. The Honor Code charges all community members to assume responsibility for the privileges and benefits associated with self -regulation. This agreement aims t o maintain a high standard of honor in all academic matters, decorum at all times, and the recognition of the Honor Council as the body responsible for self -regulation. All community members are responsible for maintaining optimal conditions for scholarly and clinical endeavors by acting honorably and reporting dishonorable behavior. Honor is an acknowledgement and acceptance that our own personal actions help to define our community. Participation in the NUNM community requires being honorable and expecti ng such veracity from fellow students, faculty, staff, clinic staff, administration and board of directors. An honorable community upholds a standard of excellence when individuals are engaged in honesty, responsibility, fairness, respect, integrity and tr ust. Honesty means being truthful, straightforward and following through with agreements. Responsibility means taking action against wrongdoing even in the face of peer pressure, fear, loyalty or compassion. Fairness evolves from respecting and protecting the fundamental rights, dignity and worth of all people. Respect is accepting that other individuals have the right to hold beliefs, attitudes and opinions that differ from our own. Respect holds and exhibits regard for all members of our community. Integrity is consistency in thought, word and behavior. Integrity is a commitment to function from the highest ethical standards of the community, the profession and ourselves. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 67 Trust occurs when members of our community o perate from a place of integrity. Trust naturally flows when there is a commitment to honesty, accountability, participation, expression and respect. To live by this Honor Code requires a personal commitment to integrity, authenticity and self - growth. To this end, a primary responsibility of all community members is to encourage honorable behavior from each other, report a known violation, and work toward resolution. As each community member is accountable for these values, we have a common ground upon which to meet and engage one another, to commit to this learning opportunity, and to maintain high standards of competence. 10.5 Honor Council The Honor Council is a standing committee composed of faculty, residents, students and staff representatives. A m inimum of one faculty member (including residents), one student representative, and one staff member is considered a quorum for an Honor Council hearing board. Hearing board members will be pulled from the members of the standing committee. The committee m eets monthly when necessary to review written complaints and performance reports referred to them from the dean of students that reflect failure of a student to maintain behavioral standards according to the Honor Code and Code of Conduct. Behavior standar ds include, but are not limited to, honesty, respect, interpersonal skills, deportment and demeanor, learning skills, professional behavior, and communication skills. The committee reviews reports that may be submitted by faculty, staff or students. The Ho nor Council, depending on the nature and severity of the report, may request the dean of students to conduct a formal Code of Conduct investigation. The committee does not accept anonymous reports. After reviewing all information, the committee will sche dule a meeting with the student to discuss reported problems. The committee makes recommendations to the dean of students who then makes the final determination and notifies the student, in writing, of the outcome. The dean of students reviews all reports submitted for Honor Council review, and on occasion, may choose to expedite the process and make a determination without submitting the information to the Honor Council for review. If the Honor Council determines that the frequency of reports, an accumulat ion of non -academic violations, or the seriousness of a report demonstrate a problem, they may recommend a more severe sanction such as probation, suspension or expulsion, which may interfere with a student's ability to complete their academic program. The reafter, any reports forwarded to the Honor Council may serve as a basis for the committee to recommend suspension. Meetings of the Honor Council are not legal proceedings. No attorneys may be present at any meeting of the committee. A student may bring a faculty member or a member of the Office of Student Life as an advisor or advocate. Advisors sole purpose during the investigative process is supportive in nature. Advisors are not allowed to speak or otherwise participate in the proceeding or participate in the investigation. After reviewing a student file, the committee may recommend disciplinary sanctions that include, but are not limited to, any of the following sanctions to the dean of students: The student is found not in violation. No further action is required. A letter of reprimand or warning outlining policy, with a reminder to adhere to the policy or procedure. Referral for required areas of deficiency, and remedial work may be required. T his may include, but is not limited to, counseling, tutoring, meeting with an advisor or mentor, repeated course work, or restricted enrollment in certain courses. 68 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Restitution Community service or educational programming Disciplinary probation for behavioral reasons. The student does not currently demonstrate the appropriate behaviors, attitudes, skills or knowledge required for the program. A student placed on disciplinary probation for behavioral reasons may be required to perform remedial work, which ma y alter their course of study. In this case, any additional reports forwarded to the committee showing concern may result in suspension from the program. A recommendation for suspension or expulsion from NUNM The committee may provide any additional recommendation it believes is suitable to address the issue at hand. Reports and letters outlining decisions made by the Honor Council , and/or dean of students, are maintaine d in the student's files in the Office of Student Life and with the school/ colleg e director . Honor Code reports do not affect a student's academic record unless the outcome is suspension or expulsion from NUNM. Copies of reports and letters are maintained in compliance with NUNM's record retention policy, as noted in the student handbo ok. 10.6 Patient Safety Monitoring Board The purpose of the Patient Safety Monitoring Board (PSMB) is to apply a systematic, objective review process to adverse clinical events, and to provide formative feedback about clinical policies, procedures and edu cational practices with the goal of improving patient care and clinical quality. The PSMB serves as a subcommittee of the Honor Council. Once a student has been referred to the Honor Council for a clinical violation, the PSMB conducts a root cause analysis using the fishbone/cause and effect method to audit NUNM systems. The information is presented to the Honor Council, which deliberates as to whether there was a patient safety issue, as well as makes recommendations for the prevention of future similar pr oblems. 10.7 Honor Council and Student Appeals Committee Recusal Policy All Honor Council and/or Student Appeals Committee (collectively, \"committee\") members shall, prior to each hearing, disclose to the committee all actual or potential conflicts of interest that may impact any committee members' ability to provide an impartial determination. A committee member has an actual conflict of interest with respect to a hearing whenever: The individual appearing before the committee is a family member or busine ss partner; Committee member was directly impacted, in any manner, by the actions causing the individual to appear before the committee; or A committee member has accepted any gift, entertainment or other favor where such acceptance creates the appearance of influence on the committee member. A committee member has a potential conflict of interest with respect to a hearing whenever an action or association of a committee member may give the appearance of a conflict of interest described above. Students sh ould bring all perceived conflicts of interest to the committee's attention prior to the commencement of the hearing. If, in its sole discretion, the committee determines that a committee member's actual or potential conflict of interest prevents the commi ttee member from providing an impartial determination, the committee member will be recused from the hearing and the remaining committee will render a decision. 10.8 Class Behaviors Guidelines NUNM faculty expects students to behave in a professional manner while in the classroom. Specifically, they expect students to: 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 69 1.

Sharing of answers is not permitted and could be a violation of the Academic Integrity policy as outlined in the handbook. 10.10 Academic Integrity Policy As stated in the Honor Code, participation in the NUNM community requires being honorable and expecting such veracity from fellow community members. An honorable community upholds a standard of excellence when individuals are engaged in honesty, responsibi lity, fairness, respect, integrity and trust. Academic integrity then becomes a cornerstone of the educational commitment of its members.

Sanctions are intended to challenge students' moral and ethical decision - making and to help them bring their behavior into accord with our community expectations. When a student is unable to conform their behavior to community expectations, the student 72 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 conduct process may determine that the student should no longer share in the privilege of participating in this community. Students should be aware that the student conduct process is quite different from criminal and civil court proceedings. Procedures and rights in student conduct procedures are conducted with fairness to all, but do not include the same protections of due process afforded by the courts. Due process, as defined wi thin these procedures, assures written notice and a hearing before an objective decision -maker. No student will be found in violation of NUNM policy without information showing that it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred and any sancti ons will be proportionate to the severity of the violation and to the cumulative conduct history of the student. Any student, faculty or staff member of NUNM may present a written allegation to the dean of students if they believe a student has engaged in conduct proscribed by this code. Allegations may not be anonymous unless it is associated with behaviors outlined in the Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation, and Title IX section of the studen t handbook . A student facing an alleged violation of the Code of Conduct or Honor Code is not permitted to withdraw or take a leave of absence from NUNM until all allegations are resolved . Procedures 1. The dean of students reviews the incident report and determines if it should be referred to the Honor Council or will be heard administratively . 2.

If referred to the Honor Council, the student handbook outlines the proceedings. 3. The dean of students shall investigate the facts underlying the allegation. The investigation shall include contact with the student that allows the student to present a written and/or oral explanation of the facts and circumstances underlying the alleged conduct. 4. All physical evidence, written statements, and notes of oral statements taken in any investigation shall be maintained in the case file relevant to the matter. 5. If the dean of students does not find probable cause to believe that conduct constituting a violation of this code has occurred, the charge shall be di smissed with a written finding of lack of probable cause. 6. The finding of suspension shall be placed in the case file, with copies delivered to the student, and a notification sent to the complaining party. Status of Affected Student Pending Proceedings During the investigation related to charges and while pending resolution, a student shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of a student in good standing; except that the dean of students (or designee ) may find that the student's presence at NUNM constitutes an unreasonable threat to the safety, health or welfare of the NUNM community, and suspend the student from NUNM pending resolution of the charges. An interim suspension from NUNM Health Centers does not permit the student to attend clinic shi fts pending resolutions of the charges. Investigation If the dean of students finds probable cause to believe that conduct occurred constituting a violation of this code, the dean of students will further investigate the allegation. A determination of responsibility is based on preponderance of evidence that conduct constituting a violation occurred or that it did not occur . The dean of students will provide written findings and conclusions to the accused student .

If, after the initial 30 -day probationary period, the student has not demonstrated improvement, the dean of students, director , or chief medical officer may elect to either ex tend the student's probation for an additional 30 days or to suspend the student from clinic. In the circumstances of probation, NUNM 's absence policy still applies. If a student has more than two absences while on probation, then a grade for that rotation may not be earned. In addition, current add/drop policies and fees may be applied. Clinic al Suspension Clinical suspension is an involuntary removal from all clinical rotations, patient care, or contact. During the clinical suspension, the student will be referred through the conduct hearing process, which could include additional sanctions, including by not limited to, suspension. In the circumstances of clinical suspension, NUNM 's absence policy still applies. If a student has more than two absences wh ile on probation, then a grade for that rotation may not be earned. In addition, current add/drop policies and fees may be applied. Clinical suspensions are not appealable. Interim Suspension This sanction imposes actions that can include separation from the institution or restriction on participation in the community for no more than 10 business days pending the scheduling of a campus hearing on alleged violation(s) of the Code of Conduct , Honor Code , or is exhibiting a serious threat to harm others . A student who receives an interim suspension notification may request a meeting with the d ean of students (or designee ) to discuss the reason(s) and terms for the interim suspension. This meeting does not supersede the conduct hearing process. During an int erim suspension, as determined by the dean of students, a student may be denied access to NUNM campus/facilities/events and the NUNM Health Centers. This restriction may also include classes, university activities, and/or privileges for which the student might otherwise have been eligible. At the discretion of the dean of students and in collaboration with and 76 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 approval from the appropriate academic director (s), alternative coursework options may be allow ed to minimize some impact on the student's academic progress. Suspension Suspension is an involuntary dismissal from NUNM and terminates the student's rights and privilege at the university . Suspensions take effect immediately and may include the current term of enrollment. During the suspension period, the student is banned from university property, NUNM Health Centers , functions, events and activities without prior written approval from the dean of students. This sanction may be enforced with a trespass action as necessary. Eligibility to return from a suspension or reapply to NUNM may be contingent upon satisfaction of specific conditions no ted at the time of suspension. If the suspensio n is for one calendar year or more, reapplication for admission is required. Readmittance is considered by NUNM , based upon consideration of the nature of the underlying incident and the circumstances of the student's actions since suspension, relevant to the ability for readmittance to contribute to the NUNM community without detrimental behavior. The student, in addition, will need to comply with all admissions procedures and requirements established by NUNM , including applying for admission. If sanctions a re imposed as a condition of readmittance, the student must also comply with any stipulat ions of that sanction before reapplying to NUNM . Readmission to NUNM is not guaranteed. See the student handbook for the Re admission p olicy. If a student is readmitted to the university, the student is placed on disciplinary probation for the remainder of their NUNM career. Upon suspension, fees will be refunded in accordance with the refund schedule. Expulsion Expulsion terminates the individual's rights and privileges as a student of NUNM permanently. The individual may not apply for re admittance to NUNM . The student is banned from university property, functions, events and activities. This sanction will be noted as a Conduct Expulsion on the student's official academic transcript. In addition to the above , any of the following sanctions may also be imposed upon student groups or organization found to have violated the Code of Conduct or Honor Code: Deactivation, de -recognition, or loss of all privileges (including status as a university registered group/organization) for a specified period of time. Parent Notification As outlined in FERPA, the university has the right to contact parents of students who are under the age of 21 when there is an extreme first offen se or multiple offen ses relating to alcohol or drug issues. By informing parents, the hope is that the university will get additional support for the student in addressing issues around substance use and providing a healthy and safe experience for the student. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 77 10.15 Appeal of Conduct Decision; Suspension or Expulsion Students have the right to appeal a suspension or expulsion from NUNM for Honor Code or Code of Conduct violations.

Any act of retaliation that is directed against a 82 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 person filing a complaint, the accused person, witness or participant in the process, by any party, will be treated as a separate and distinct charge. If the university determines that a student has engaged in retaliation, appropriate corrective or disci plinary action will be taken, up to and including expulsion. In addition, the university will not retaliate against anyone who brings forth a complaint with the school, or any state or federal agency, or for participating in a n investigation or proceedin g. SECTION 11: POLICY AGAINST DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION , AND TITLE IX NUNM is committed to providing a healthy learning and work environment for its students, staff and faculty. Discrimination, harassment and retaliation fundamentally compromise the integrity of human relationships, affect morale and performance, and threate n an individual's sense of security and well -being. They may also violate the law. NUNM works to prevent such occurrences, and to remediate discrimination, harassment and retaliation that occurs. All persons who are employed by, or enrolled at NUNM, sho uld be able to work in an environment free from all prohibited forms of harassment and discrimination including (but not necessarily limited to) harassment or discrimination based on sex or gender, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, s exual orientation, gender identity and expression, veteran or military status, or any other category protected under federal, state or local law. NUNM is committed to the prohibition of discrimination in the workplace, as covered under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. No NUNM student, faculty, staff, administrator or board member is exempt from this policy. NUNM also prohibits behavior that violates this policy by visitors, business invitees, vendors, community partners, and all other individuals who impact NUNM's educational programs and activities; NUNM will address policy violations by those individuals to the extent reasonably possible given NUNM's control over them. 11.1 Definitions Discrimination is excluding from participation, denying ben efits to, or otherwise subjecting a person or a group of people to negative differential treatment based on the person's protected class. For the purposes of this policy, a \"protected class\" includes gender, race, color, religion, national origin, age, dis ability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran or military status, pregnancy status, or any other status protected under federal, state or local law. Harassment is unwelcome conduct based on a person's protected class. Harassment c an include verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive that it has the effect, intended or unintended, of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work or academic performance , or it has created an intimidating, host ile or offensive environment and would have such an effect on a reasonable person. Sexual Harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature where such conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive that it has the effect, intended or unintended, of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work or academic performance , or it has created an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment and would have such an effect on a reasonable person. It includes q uid pro quo sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. NUNM will analyze and may have an obligation 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 83 to respond to any complaint of sexual harassment i t receives, regardless of whether the incident occurred on the cam pus of the institution or elsewhere. Title IX Sexual Harassment is conduct on the basis of sex that includes one or more of the following: Quid pro quo sexual harassment Hostile environment: The perpetrator engages in unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to NUNM's education program s or activities ; and/or Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and s talking To qualify as Title IX s exual harassment, the behavior must also meet other requirements, including: Occurring in the United States, In an NUNM educational program or activity, At a property owned or controlled by a recognized NUNM student organization, and/or Other requirements as described in the Department of Education's regulations interpreting Title IX. Consent occurs when each person participating in sexual interaction voluntarily, knowingly, affirmatively, and clearly gives verbal permission for a sexual activity. Consent may be given and withdrawn at any point while a sexual interaction is occurring. If consen t is granted for some sexual activity, and the sexual interaction exceeds the extent of the consent, then there is not consent for the additional activity. Silence or absence of resistance does not imply consent. Consent cannot be given in circumstances wh en the person is incapable of giving consent due to intoxication or other reason, nor can consent be given when the person is subject to coercion, force, threat or intimidation. Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment (\"this for that\") occurs when an NUNM employee conditions the provision of an NUNM aid, benefit or service on a person's participation in unwelcome sexual conduct. Sexual Assault is any offense classified as a forcible or nonforcible sex offense under the uniform crime reporting system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. These offenses include but are not limited to the following: Sex Offense: Any sexual act directed against another person, without the consent of the person, including instances where the person is incapable of giving conse nt. Rape (except s tatutory rape): The carnal knowledge of a person, without the consent of the person, including instances where the person is incapable of giving consent because of their age or because of their temporary or permanent mental or physical i ncapacity.

Retaliation means any adverse treatment that is taken because a person has opposed discrimination or harassment, made a complaint, given information, assist ed, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this policy that would discourage a reasonable person from engaging in those activities. Stalking is a form of sexual harassment when there is behavior directed toward a specific person over time (repetitively and menacing) by a specific individual, which is both unwelcome and would cause a reasonable person to feel fear. Complainant : A person who reports experiencing d iscrimination, harassment, or s exual harassment. Reporter : A person who reports discrimination, harassment, or s exual harassment experienced by another person.

Title IX requires specific procedures for addressing Title IX sexual harassment. Title IX Coordinator : An NUNM official authorized to receive reports of s exual harassment and provide corrective action. NUNM has identified the dean of students as the Title IX coordinator. NUNM has identified two deputy coordinators: the vice president of human r esources, and the director of security. In this policy, the functions of the Title IX c oordinator may be performed by the coordinator or a deputy coordinator. 11.2 Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Harassment, and Retaliation Prohibited NUNM strictly pro hibits discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, and r etaliation in all its forms. NUNM is committed to responding promptly to concerns about these behaviors, to investigating appropriately, and to taking steps to end these behaviors and prevent their recurrence. 11.3 Reporting and Resources Reporting and Resources Inside NUNM NUNM will promptly respond to any report or complaint of d iscrimination, harassment, or s exual harassment that it receives, regardless of whether the incident occurred on the ca mpus of the institution or elsewhere. This includes all forms of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and s talking. Any person may make a report of discrimination, harassment, or s exual harassment at any time. Any student or employee who believes that they are or may being subjected to d iscrimination, harassment, or s exual harassment should immediately report it to any one of the following: dean of students (Title IX coordinator), vice pre sident of human resources (Title IX deputy coordinator), director of security (Title IX deputy c oordinator), or a school/college director . Any person may make a report on behalf of a c omplainant with the intent to safeguard the community. Reports may also be made anonymously. However, it may be more difficult for NUNM to address anonymous reports or reports without a complainant. The contact information for the Title IX coordinator is as follows: Rachael Allen 49 South Porter St reet, Portland , OR 97201 rallen@nunm.edu 503.552.1607 Reports can also be filed online at nunm -advocate.symplicity.com/public_report/ . This reporting form can also be found on the page footer of the NUNM website: \"Community Reporting.\" The Title IX c oordinator or a designee will promptly provide resources and referrals provided to any person who reports experiencing s exual harassment. Upon receipt of the r eport, the Title IX coordinator will determine if there is a campus safety issue and act accordingly, as well as determine next steps of action. Reports are kept private as much as possible, while still responding appropriately to the complaint. NUNM will consider the c omplainant's individual wishes regarding 86 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 inquiries/investigations to the greatest extent possible.

However, repo rting criminal behavior to the Portland Police is always an option. The Portland Police Bureau's non -emergency phone number is 503.823.0000. Any person experiencing or observing an emergency should call 911. Employees of NUNM are mandatory reporters of ch ild abuse and abuse of elders or vulnerable adults. There are no exceptions to this policy. Mandatory reports should be directed to the Oregon Department of Human Services hotline at 1 .855.503.SAFE (7233). Any person experiencing or observing an emergency should call 911. If an order of protection or a restraining order is filed with a local law office, NUNM encourages the person protected by the order to notify the Office of Safety and Security, Office of Student Life, and/or Human Resources, regardless o f whether the order is against an NUNM community member. This allows NUNM to assist in the enforcement of the order within NUNM property. Off-Campus Resources Portland Police Bureau: 911 or 503.823.3333 Call to Safety (former Portland Women's Crisis Line): 888.235.5333 Sexual Assaul t Resource Center: 503.640.5311 Multnomah Emergency Room: 503.494.7551 Multnomah County Victim Assistance: 503.988.3222 11.4 Amnesty Provision In order to encourage proper and timely reporting of s exual harassment, NUNM will not adjudicate or sanction the victim of the alleged s exual harassment for the admitted use of alcohol or drugs in the course of events of the alleged interaction, which other wise may have been found in violation of campus policies, if the person reports being a victim of s exual harassment as described in these policies. 11.5 Report Intake and Analysis When the Title IX coordinator receives a report under this policy, they will consult with the reporter and/or the complainant to determine the nature of the matter, the desired response, and whether the matter requires a more comprehensive investigation. Title IX Sexual H arassment Cases If the Title IX c oordinator determines that the report is alleging Title IX sexual harassment, they will address the alleged Title IX s exual harassment under the Title IX -specific procedures that 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 87 apply to the respondent. If the r espondent is a student, f aculty member or staff member, the Title IX coordinator will address the matter through the student Title IX hearing process. More information can be found at nunm.edu/about/title -ix/. If the respondent is neither student, faculty, nor staff, the Title IX c oordinator will assist the complainant in accessing whatever procedures are available (including procedures outside NUNM) to address the matter. All Other Cases If the matter alle ged does not involve Title IX sexual harassment, then NUNM will address it through its ordinary procedures that govern cases of discrimination, harassment and retaliation. If the respondent is a student, the Title IX c oordinator will refer the matter for resolution through the Student Code of Conduct . If the respondent is an employee, the Title IX c oordinator will refer the matter to Human Resources for resolution through its grievance procedures. If the respondent is neither student, faculty, nor staff, t he Title IX coordinator will assist the complainant in accessing whatever procedures are available (including procedures outside NUNM) to address the matter. 11.6 Title IX Sexual Harassment Procedures This is a summary of NUNM's Title IX hearing process that applies to student respondents . For further detail, please consult the full process at nunm.edu/about/title -ix/. Supportive and Remedial Response In some cases, a complainant may prefer not to have a formal process, but to receive supportive measures from NUNM and remedies to assist them in continuing to access NUNM's education programs and services. NUNM will provide supportive measures and remedies when requested. NUNM will honor a complainant's wishes concerning a formal investigation whenever possible, given the Title IX coordinator's assessment of the safety needs of the community. In some cases, the Title IX coordinator may need to file a complaint on behalf of the institution to ensure that the community's needs are addressed. Informal Resolution If the Title IX c oordinator deems an informal resolution appropriate, they will offer the parties the opportunity to pursue such a resolution. Informal resolution is always voluntary, and either party may elect to terminate it at any time and pursue a formal grievance process. Formal Process Complaint and Investigation If the complainant or the Title IX coordinator proceed with a formal complaint, the Title IX coordinator will begin with a formal investigation by selecting a trained i nvestigator. The Title IX coordinator will vet all investigators to ensure that they are free of bias or conflict of interest. At all times, NUNM proceeds with presumption that a respond ent is not responsible unless and until the formal Title IX process concludes with a determination of responsibility. The assigned i nvestigator will promptly investigate the complaint in a fair and equitable manner. Although complete confidentiality cann ot be guaranteed, reports will be handled as discreetly as practicable. NUNM takes into consideration the stressful nature of an investigation and attempts to conclude investigations within a 60 -calendar -day period. Delays may occur if good cause requires it; if a delay occurs the investigator will let the complainant and r espondent know about the delay and the reason for it. The investigator will provide the r espondent with a written notice describing the complaint with specificity, including relevant dat es and times, how the accusations would violate NUNM's policies if true, and describing the parties' rights throughout the process. The complainant will 88 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 receive a copy of that notice. NUNM will not restrict the complainant or respondent from discussing the complaint with others. The complainant and r espondent may have an advisor of their choice during the interview process, who may or may not be an attorney. Advisors' sole purpose during the investigation process is supportive in nature. Advisors are not allowed to speak or otherwise participate in th e investigation. NUNM may offer supportive measures to the complainant and r espondent throughout the process to restore or preserve equal access to the NUNM's education program s or activit ies, to protect the safety of all parties or of NUNM's educationa l environment, or to deter sexual harassment. Supportive measures are non -disciplinary, non- punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, without fee or charge, and without unreasonably burdening the other party. They ma y include counseling, extensions of deadlines or other course -related adjustments, modifications of class schedules, campus escort services, mutual restrictions on contact between the parties, leaves of absence, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of campus, and other similar measures. In certain cases, NUNM may take emergency measures to protect the safety of c omplainants, including interim suspension of respondents. The investigator will meet with the involved parties (including any witnes ses) to gather information and evidence, and they will assess the information and evidence gathered. At least 10 days before completing their report, the investigator will make available all evidence directly related to the complaint available to the parti es for inspection and will provide a copy of the draft report. The c omplainant and r espondent will have an opportunity for a written response. The investigator will consider the responses before completing the report. The report will fairly summarize relev ant evidence, but it will not form conclusions or determine sanctions. At least 10 days before any hearing, the i nvestigator will provide a copy of the report to the parties. Formal Process - Hearing After investigation, Title IX sexual harassment cases w ill proceed to a hearing. This section provides a summary of the hearing procedures. Each party will receive a notice of hearing that outlines all relevant information, including hearing procedures. The hearing may be in person or by remote technology, s o long as all participants can see and hear each other in real time. The hearing will be recorded, and each party will have access to the recording after the hearing. No recording other than the official recording is allowed. NUNM will appoint a hearing officer to administer the hearing and make decisions about what evidence is relevant and meets the standards for being included in the record. A three -person Hearing Board, separate from the hearing officer, will decide the matt er. The Hearing Board may not include the i nvestigator. The hearing participants will include the parties, their advisors, the hearing officer, the members of the Hearing Board, witnesses, and any NUNM officials that are relevant to the process. Each part y must be accompanied by an advisor. The parties may choose an advisor, or NUNM will appoint a trained advisor for them. At the hearing, the investigator will present the report. Each party will then have an opportunity to present information and addres s the allegations, evidence and information in the report. Each party will also have an opportunity to ask questions of witnesses. Only advisors may ask 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 89 questions of witnesses at the live hearing, but each party is otherwise expected to speak on their own behalf. During the hearing, all participants are expected to act with proper decorum and treat all other participants with respect. The hearing officer may exclude any participant who fails to meet this standard and who does not correct their behavior after the he aring officer reminds them. After the live hearing, the Hearing Board will consider the matter and make a decision by the preponderance of the evidence, which means that the conclusion is more likely than not. The Hearing Board will notify the parties simu ltaneously in writing regarding the final determination. The notice will include the details of the complaint, the policies violated or not violated, the Hearing Board's determination of the relevant facts, whether remedies will be provided to the complai nant, what sanctions (if any) will be imposed on the respondent, and the procedures for appeal. The r espondent may be subject to any sanctions described in the Student Code of Conduct. The hearing officer may assist the Hearing Board in preparing and transmitting the final determination, but the hearing officer may not make any of the decisions. The complainant and r espondent have the right to appeal. If either party appeals, NUNM will withhold imposition of any sanctions until the appeal is complete. Formal Process Appeal Procedure The parties may appeal to the dean of s tudents within 10 business days. Any appeal must meet specific criteria for identifying procedural errors, conflicts of interest or bias, or identifying new and previously unavailable evidence. If the appeal specifies appropriate grounds, the dean of students will offer the opposing party and other affected hearing participants an opportunity to object in writing. The parties and affected hearing participants will receive a simultaneous written notification of the decision. The dean of s tudents' decisions are final and not subject to appeal. 11.7 Prevention Education The Office of Student Life, the Counseling Center , and the Office of Safety and Security conduct campus safety programming. This programming is designed to inform and educate the campus of various ways to avoid, interrupt and address safety issues on campus, including bystander intervention, reporting of violent crimes, and a description of personal safety measures. The campus safety programming addresses issues, prevention of, and training related to domestic violence, sexual assault dating violence and stalking, as required by Title IX laws and the Campu s SaVE (Sexual Violence Elimination) Act. The educational outcome of the events is an understanding of how to prevent these issues from occurring, how to intervene if you witness an event occurring, and information as to how to reduce and recognize signs o f violence. These presentations occur annually and are open to all community members. 11.8 Training of Title IX Personnel NUNM trains its Title IX c oordinator and deputy coordinators, investigators, decision makers (including Hearing Board members who mak e decisions on Title IX matters), and any person who facilitates an informal resolution process. They receive training on the definition of Title IX sexual harassment, the scope of NUNM's education program s and activit ies, NUNM's definition of consent, how to conduct an investigation and grievance process including hearings, appeals, and informal resolution processes (as applicable ), and how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias. 90 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 SECTION 12: STUDENT COMPLAINT AND RESOLUTION POLIC IES Students at NUNM have the right to an education free from prejudices, bigotry or other egregious actions or behaviors that hinder their ability to learn. NUNM is committed to effectively resolving stude nt grievances through an efficient, fair and systematic process. This process is to be used when a student feels that decisions, differences, misunderstandings or problems that have arisen with faculty, staff, administration or other students have hindered their ability to learn or otherwise adversely affected them. NUNM seeks to cultivate an academic environment that encourages tolerant, respectful and non -discriminatory behavior from all of its inhabitants. The purpose of NUNM's Complaint and Resolution Policy is to resolve student grievances in a manner that allows for constructive relationships to be maintained across the institution, while ensuring that any violation of school policy and/or issues of harassment or discrimination are appropriately addre ssed and do not reoccur. The policy is designed to create an environment that responds promptly and with sensitivity to the needs of the accuser, respects the rights of the accused, and addresses the concerns of the community. All grievance records are pri vate in nature and will be treated with the utmost discretion. 12.1 Informal Process NUNM values opportunities to exercise conflict resolution and self -advocacy skills, and recognizes both as foundational skills of professionalism. For this reason, any student with a NUNM -related problem involving academic or administrative policy, procedure, decision or conduct should make an attempt in good faith to resolve the problem through one or more discussions with the person or persons most directly involved. Any safety concerns should be brought to the attention of the dean of students, director of the office of equity and inclusion, or director of security. The student with th e complaint may choose to enlist the assistance of another member of the campus community (e.g., a member of the faculty, student life , or a fellow student) to help support them through the process. If the problem cannot be resolved in this most direct way , the student should then seek the assistance of the administrator most directly involved (faculty member, school/college director , or other supervisor). If the complaint is still not resolved to the satisfaction of the student after discussion at these in formal levels, the student may proceed to the formal grievance procedure. 12.2 Grievances The NUNM Stude nt Complaint and Resolution p olicy provides a means by which a student may seek an equitable and orderly resolution regarding a complaint against an employee, while the employee was acting in an official capacity (e.g., faculty member, administrator, staff member, or another student). An unresolved complaint is raised to the level of a formal grievance when the student submits a written Student Grieva nce (see the Formal Grievance section of the student handbook ). A grievance is an educational matter, personal issue or condition that a student believes to be unfair, inequitable, and/or a hindrance to their education. A grievance may be filed for an alle ged violation of campus policy or procedure that adversely impacts the student. In order for a grievance to be formally considered, actions against the student must have occurred in relation to an NUNM policy, procedure or established practice that were arbitrary, capricious, unequitable, bigoted, malicious or otherwise professionally inappropriate in natu re. Due to the difficulty of pursuing details after many days or weeks have passed, students are encouraged to bring grievances forward as soon as possi ble. All grievances begin by consulting with the dean of students, director of the office of equity and inclusion, or an appointed administrative substitute if neither of those two people are available (appointments are made by the dean of students) . 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 91 Stude nts should allow up to 10 business days to receive a response in writing or in person to their complain t or grievance. All proceedings conducted under this policy are closed. The student may bring a support person (not an attorney, as this is not a legal p roceeding) to any proceeding if so desired, but such person is not permitted to participate in any part of the discussions. Exemptions from this policy : The following matters are not handled as student grievances within the scope of this policy, but may be directed for attention as follows: Grade appeals. Students may not file a grievance for a grade appeal, except when the student believes that the faculty has displayed unethical, illegal or improper conduct within the context of a grade given. For more on grade appeal processes, see the Grade Appeal Policy of the student handbook. Incidences of gender discrimination or (sexual) harassment. Sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, or any complaint concerning gender discrimination are governed under the Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation, and Title IX section in the student handbook. Mistreatment or discrimination based on race color or national origin. These complaints are governed under t he Office of Equity and Inclusion and should be directed there. If a student is unsure of next steps for any grievance that falls under these exemptions, they may consult with the dean of students or director of the office of equity and inclusion for guidance. Retaliation No student will be penalized in any way for attempting to resolve problems in good faith through this procedure. By initiating and pursuing a grievance resolution, a student is obligated to proceed in candor and good faith at all times. Retaliation for attempting to resolve a conflict in a respectful manner is strictly forbidden at NUNM and is subject to severe sanctions. 12.3 Formal Grievance Process If, and only if , the student has made a good faith effort to resolve the matter in question and is dissatisfied with the ou tcome of the Informal Conflict Resolution process, the student may file a formal written grievance with the Office of Student Life. Grievances regarding the dean of students may be filed with the vice president of student engagement and innovation. Written grievances can be sent via email or in person, or through the online community reporting form to the dean of students and should include as much detail as possible, any existing evidence, and an outline of the desired outcome to bring satisfactory resolut ion. The dean of students (or appointed designee) will consider the written account and determine whether the alleged incident is able to be grieved based on information and documentation provided by the student. A grievance meets the appropriate threshold for a formal grievance procedure under the following examples: Inappropriate or unprofessional handling of a written NUNM policy, procedu re or established practice Actions taken that are arbitrary, bigoted, capr icious, malicious or other wise egregiously unprofessional Treatment or consideration based on class or category rather than individual merit; partiality or prejudice founded in gender identity , age, religion, sexual orienta tion, body shape, or disability 92 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 If it is determined that the allegation meets the above standards, the dean of students will investigate the allegation or assign the grievance to the appropriate university official for resolution. The dean of students (or appointed administrative substitu te) will advise the student of the decision in writing within five business days as to whether the issu e will be investigated further. The investigation process will include interviewing the student and respondent, and other fact - finding actions as deemed appropriate. The designated official will report the outcome to the student no later than ten business days following the notice of investigation, not including weekends or established holidays, based on assessment of the information provided after receiv ing the grievance. In the unforeseen event the dean (or appointed administrative substitute) needs additional time to review the evidence, the dean (or appointed administrative substitute) will notify the student in writing of the deadline extension. After the investigation has concluded and a decision rendered in writing, all materials will be immediately returned to the dean of students to be placed in the appropriate fi les. Student conduct files are kept under strict confidentiality and only shared on a need to know basis. 12.4 Grievance Outcome Appeal Process In most instances the decision of the designated official is final; however, under certain circumstances a grievance may be appealed to the vice president of student engagement and innovation in writing. Within three business days from the decision date rendered by the dean of students (or appointed administrative substitute) the student must notify the vice president of student engagement and innovation (or designated administrative substitute) of intention to appeal. The student will then have seven calendar days to complete and submit to the vice president of student engagement and innovation (or appointed administrative substitute) a written request for review. The vice president of student enga gement and innovation (or appointed administrative substitute) will respond with a final decision within ten business days, not including weekends and published holidays that the university is closed, based on assessment of the information provided by the dean of students and the investigation of procedure. An appeal to the vice president of student engagement and innovation must be based on the following grounds, either individually or in combination: Additional information relevant to the grievance is now available for consideration that was not initially available to be considered by the designated official; The investigation was not conducted in accordance with this procedure; Implementation of the remedy proposed by the designated official would be illegal or constitute a violation of written NUNM policy, pro cedure or established practice The vice president of student engagement and innovation (or appointed administrative substitute) may elect to uphold the decision of the dean of students (or appoi nted administrative substitute) ; reverse the decision ; or request a different resolution in light of new information that was previously not available to, or considered by, the dean of students (or appointed administrative substitute). 12.5 Accreditation Agency Information If a student is not satisfied that NUNM has adhered to its policy or been fair in its handling of the complaint, the student may contact the appropriate accreditation agency listed below. National University of Natural Medicine is accr edited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) . Accreditation of an institution of higher education by the NWCCU indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality evaluated 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 93 through a peer revie w process. An accredited university or university is one which has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the NWCCU is not partial, but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. Inquiries regarding an institution's accredited status by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities should be directed to the administrative staff of the institution.

For informat ion about community resources, please visit nunm.edu/equity . 13.4 Disability and Accommodation Services NUNM and the Center for Academic Success are committed to following Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) as amended in 2008 (ADAAA), and other applicable federal and state regulations and university policies which prohibit discriminatio n on the basis of a disability. Under these laws, students with a documented disability have a right to receive reasonable accommodations. Students also have responsibilities under these laws. Students are responsible for turning in requests for accommod ations within an appropriate time frame, submitting adequate documentation from a qualified medical practitioner, as well as meeting and maintaining NUNM satisfactory academic progress and technical standards. Students seeking an accommodation must sched ule an appointment with the director of academic success and access and complete the \" Disability and Academic Accommodation \" form available online . An accommodation request must be supported by adequate documentation. Adequate documentation must: Be from a qualified professional, where a (biomedicine) diagnosis of the disability is within their scope of practice and licensure (including but not limited to: ND, . Note: LAc, LMT, etc ., are not licensed to diagnosis biomedicine) Include a brie f history of the student's disability, a description and evidence of impairment , and any current treatment plans if applicable Demonstrate how the disability affects/impacts a particular delivery system, instructional method, or evaluation criteria Identify requested accommodation(s) and provide rationale for the requested accommodation(s), clearly explaining why each recommendation for accommodation is appropriate Be no older than five years prior to enrollment at NUNM The Center for Academic Succe ss will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the request in a timely manner but cannot guarantee that an untimely request can be met . Untimely requests may result in delay, substitutions , or denial of accommodation. Upon approval of accommodations , the Center for Academic Success will provide the student an official accommodation letter with which the student will share with necessary parties (i.e., faculty, security, facilities, school/college director s, etc.). Information about the disability is confidential, however anonymity is not guaranteed. 13.5 Service Animal Policy In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), service animals are permitted in campus facilities for persons with a physical disability (including but not limite d to psychiatric, 96 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 cognitive, mental, communication, physical and sensory disabilities). The disability must limit one or more daily life activities and the person must be regarded by a health care practitioner as having such a disability that requires the u se of a service animal. The ADA recognizes only dogs (no weight, size or breed limitations ) as service animals. The service animal must be housebroken, on a leash or harness , and individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability. The service the animal is providing must be directly related to the person's disability (i.e., retrieve medicine, offer stability, alert to seizures, etc. ). Dogs that meet this definition are considered service animals under the ADA regardless of whether they have been licensed or certified by a state or local government. Dogs whose sole purpose or function is to offer comfort and/or emotional support do not qualify as service animals. Under law, NUNM and its members are not allowed to ask an individual about the nature/extent of the ir disability; require documentation proving that the animal is an assistance animal, or; require that the individual pay any fee for the assistance animal. However, to ascertain if the animal presented on campus is a servic e animal, the university may ask: Is the animal required due to a disability? The nature of the work/task that the animal is trained to do/perform. Care an d Maintenance of Service Animals The student handler of a service animal must be in full control of the service animal at all times, including but not limited to basic obedience commands and control of leash/harness. The care and supervision of a service animal is solely the responsibility of its s tudent handler and cannot be handed over to another person . Care and maintenance includes but is not limited to : Ensuring the animal is housebroke and all/any of the animal's waste elimination is done in appropri ate areas; Always carrying equipment sufficient to clean up the animal's waste whenever the animal and handler are on university property; and Be responsible fo r the proper disposal of the animal's waste and for any damage caused by the waste or its remov al. Denial or Exclusion of Service Animal(s) NUNM may deny or exclude a service animal only if the animal : Is a direct threat (e.g., biting, nipping, attacking) Creates u ndue financial and administrative burden Fundamental ly alters any services, programs or activities (e.g., continuous barking or whining unrelated to their service role , growling during class and/or clinic shifts, etc.) The exclusion of a service animal will be based on an individual assessment based on recent credible, objective evidence relating to the specific animal. The university will then work with the student to identify other means of adequate accommodations. This policy is limited to service animals as identified above ; an animal that provides emotional support, comfort, or companionship (therapy or comfort animals) is not included as a protected assistance animal under Oregon laws, and is expressly excluded as an assistance animal under the ADA and therefore not allowed on campus ( see the Animals on Campus section in the handbook 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 97 Students requiring the assistance of a service animal on campus should contact the director of academic success and a ccess to ensure adequate assistance, and become familiar with NUNM's servi ce animal policies should questions from staff/faculty arise. 13.6 Food Service Food service at the NUNM campus is provided by multiple independent mobile food truck vendors that visit the campus periodically o n a scheduled basis each term.

The TriMet pass is a sticker affixed to the student ID and must be presented upon boarding TriMet buses, trains or MAX. The pass is not transferable. Students must sign an acknowledgement of TriMet's pass rules and a fee acknowledgement statement prior to receiving their TriMet Pass. Once a pass has been issued, TriMet passes cannot be returned for a refund Passes may be purchased at the beginning of fall, winter and spring quarter, and expire at the end of that quarter. Bus passes can be purchase d from the Business Office within the first two weeks of each term. After that time no passes will be available for pick up. Summer term is not included in the TriMet University Universal Pass Program. Therefore, students may purchase a bus pass at a hig her, yet still discounted, rate for the term. Summer TriMet Passes must be ordered from facilities four weeks prior to the beginning of summer term in order to receive them by the beginning of the summer term. If a TriMet pass is lost, replacement bus pa sses may be purchased through the Business Office. Students who request a replacement bus pass as a result of losing their ID card will be charged a prorated cost for the remaining weeks of the term. This only applies if there are remaining passes after te rm distribution. A student with a lost ID card will be charged a replacement fee; in addition, there is a fee to replace a lost TriMet pass. The TriMet fee may be waived, however, if the student chooses not to replace it. For information regarding fees, pl ease consult the university catalog. 13.13 Housing NUNM does not offer student housing; t he Office of Student Life refers all housing information and requests to the designated bulletin board.

Information sent to students from NUNM via university mailboxes is considered official communication and should be treated as such. To ensure the security of student mail within the NUNM community, all students will be assigned an NUNM mailbox and code during new student orientation. Students will maintain the same mailbox through their tenure at NUNM. However, students who take a leave of absence will have their mailbox reassigned. No outside solicitation mailings are al lowed in student mailboxes. The Registrar's Office maintains the official list of mailbox assignments and combinations. A student who forgets their mailbox combination should contact the Registrar's Office. Students are responsible for checking their mai l regularly, and reading and responding to all mail in their mailboxes, including any announcements, correspondence from university offices, and other official university business. All mail (including exams and papers) must include both the student's name and mailbox number. Mail without a student's name or mailbox number may be delayed in delivery, returned to sender, or destroyed. Mail distribution occurs one time daily, Monday through Fr iday. NUNM mailboxes are for internal mail only. Students should not receive any type of mail from the U.S. Postal Service or receive vendor products. If a student is receiving vendor products on behalf of a specific office, arrangements are made with that office to receive the products for the student. In addition, students are not allowed into the faculty/staff mailroom unless accompanied by an NUNM employee. 13.19 Telephone and Facsimile Student phones are located in the student lounge and are for local calls only. Students are asked to use administrative phones for university calls only. The Student Government Association also provides a fax machine for student use; it is located in the student lounge. There is no cost to students to receive or send faxes. (The fax number students can use to receive faxes is 503.220.1423.) In consideration for this free service, and to help the university control administrative costs, students are asked to limit the number of pages they receive per fax transmission to no more than two pages. Please note that faxes received in the student lounge are in a public area and cannot be guaranteed confidential. SECTION 14: OTHER STUDENT POLICIES 14.1 New Student Orientation New student orientation is a required course that provides students with the opportunity to become oriented and familiar with the campus and their peers; meet with essential faculty, staff 100 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 and administrators; and learn the rights, responsibilities and expectations of b eing a student at NUNM. Any student who is enrolling in NUNM half time or greater is required to attend n ew student orientation prior to the first term of enrollment. Attending new student orientation is a requirement for graduation from NUNM. A student who matriculates into an additional program during their academic career is exempt from participating in a second new student orientation course. Students who complete new student orientation will receive a grade of \"CMP\" for completion. Failure to attend all of new student orientation will result in a grade of \"NC\" and the student will be required to retake the course the next time it is offered. Students who miss new student orientation will not be refunded the fee. Students readmitted to NUNM must make an appointment with the Office of Student Life to determine if reorientation is required. Non-degree seeking students are not required to attend new student orientation, however, they are required to familiarize themselves with NUNM policies and should contact the Office of Student Life with questions. 14.2 Financial Policies, Fees, Financial Aid , and Consumer Information Refer to the current NUNM catalog for the most updated financial poli cies and fees, financial aid , and consumer information. 14.3 Relationships \u2014 Faculty/Staff and Students Faculty, staff and student interaction is encouraged to help maintain communications throughout the NUNM community. Faculty/staff and student contact is encouraged to provide role models for students; faculty members are expected to be available to student s at regular hours for consultation regarding classroom material. However, there are situations when dual relationships within the NUNM community may occur, such as when faculty/staff and students have both a professional and social relationship, also known as a dual relationship. A dual relationship occurs when students and faculty/staff engage in two or more of these situations, including teaching, evaluation, advising, mentoring, program administration, or a privileged therapeutic relationship (doctor/ patient or counselor/client). The complexity of these dual relationships is challenging and can obscure perceived or actual objectivity, and create a conflict of interest due to inherent power differentials. Therefore, close personal relationships between faculty/staff and students, in the presence of a conflict of interest where the student could be favored or discriminated against at NUNM, either of which would be in violation of the NUNM policy on discrimination, are strongly discouraged. In addition, a breach of confidentiality and professional ethics could occur, also resulting in violation of NUNM policies. For these reasons, romantic/sexual relationships between faculty/staff and students are strongly discouraged. Any relationships between faculty/ staff and students that result in favoritism or discrimination are strictly prohibited. In the event that a faculty/staff member and a student are contemplating a sexually intimate relationship, the student and employee are required to disclose the potential relationship prior to 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 101 entering a romantic/sexual relationship to their immediate supervisor and Human Resources (employee) and dean of students (student). Al l measures will be taken to ensure that any actual or potential conflict of interest is addressed. Corrective action may include employee withdrawal from all supervisory, evaluative or other authoritative relationships with the student, and will remain in effect until the student has completed their training, irrespective of whether the relationship continues or not. For faculty, this includes, but is not limited to, withdrawal from any study committee on which they serve with the student, not participatin g in faculty evaluations of the student, and withdrawal from examination, supervision, class teaching and thesis evaluation of the student. In the case of an administrative staff member, the staff member will also withdraw from any position involving a con flict of interest, such as granting scholarships or supervising work -study positions. Romantic or sexual relationships that occurred prior to either the faculty/staff member or a student becoming affiliated with NUNM must also be disclosed by the faculty/staff member to their direct supervisor /director, and to Human Resources. In the case of a past relationship, the faculty/staff person must still withdraw from all supervisory, evaluative, or other power relationships with the student as above. Students should report romantic or sexual relationships with faculty/staff that occurred prior to matriculation to NUNM to the dean of students. All cases will be managed on an individual basis. 14.4 Appearance and Dress on Campus NUNM expects its students to present themselves in a manner consistent with their future profession. Students should be neat and clean. Although we want to continue to foste r the individuality of each student, it is important to remember that visitors and clinic patients frequent our halls. Therefore, extreme or immodest dress should be avoided, and shoes must be worn at all times (unless the wearing of shoes conflicts with c lassroom participation). All students who register for a clinic shift must abide by the clinic dress code whenever working in the NUNM Health Centers or community clinics. Closed -toe shoes must be worn in all laboratory/clinical settings. While NUNM reco gnizes that student practice of bodywork techniques on peers may require various stages of undress, nudity is not permissible in any NUNM common area. Common areas include, but are not limited to, food service areas, student lounge, halls, restrooms and an y other areas to which the community has access without keyed entry. All bodywork practice on university premises must be done in approved, scheduled classrooms. Classrooms may be scheduled for practice through the Campus Information Center . Students should post signs notifying the community that the classroom is in use. 14.5 Fragrance -Free Campus NUNM requests that students, staff and faculty be aware of fragrances and aromas that can cause allergic reactions for some; this includes but is not limited to cigarette smoke, body odor and essential oils. NUNM requests students, staff and faculty refrain from using fragrance products (i.e., perfume, scented soaps and personal hygiene products, scented fabric softeners) prior to arriving or while on campus, at a clinic or at any NUNM event. NUNM also requests that students, faculty and staff refrain from using solvent -based highlighters, as the solvents used in the markers cause allergic reactions for some individuals and are toxic. 102 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 14.6 No Smoking Policy NUNM is a smoke -free campus. Smoking is not allowed on any part of the campus grounds, including the NUNM Health Centers. 14.7 Animals on Campus Animals, except for service animals (i.e., for vision or hearing impaired), are not permitted on NUNM property . A student in violation of this policy will be held financially responsible for property or personal damages caused by the animal on NUNM premises. This policy includes, but is not limited to, animals in parking lots, at food cart stalls, and left unatten ded in vehicles on university property. NUNM reserves the right to call animal control authorities to enforce this policy. Information regarding requests for academic accommodations, including service animals, can be found in the student handbook. 14.8 Children on Campus Students are welcome to bring their children to campus to conduct general business or attend campus events. While on campus, children will be subject to the same conditions as all other visitors to the university. However, children are not permitted to attend class with parents. Children are not allowed to attend clinic shifts with parents unless they are being seen as a patient and accompanied by a guardian. Parents of infants up to 12 months of age and nursing mothers who need to express/pump may request authorization to use the remote room for specific classes. All requests must have faculty and the Office of Student Life's approval. Babysitting/childcare is not available on campus, nor is it permissible for parents to make private arrangements for on -campus babysitting/childcare. Parents are required to make suitable arrangements for off -site babysitting/childcare so that they may attend class and/or clini c shifts. The Office of Student Life can provide a list of local day care facilities. The remote room policy and privileges does not include studying, exams, and quizzes. Students are expected to find alternative child care during exams. 14.9 Remote Room s A remote classroom with audio/video live feeds is only available to student parents who have nursing infants and others with permission from the Office of Student Life. Students are required to submit a request form, including faculty signature, to estab lish expectations of class participation. Please note that not all classes are available for remote viewing due to the nature of some classes and specific instructor requirements. Babies -in-arms are permitted in remote rooms, but parents must find off -site childcare once babies begin crawling or are over 12 months of age. Due to academic concerns regarding class participation and video education, students are permitted to use the remote classroom for a maximum of two quarters per infant during their NUNM de gree program (or concurrent -degree track). Exceptions to the two -term limit may be granted by the Office of Student Life. The remote room policy and privileges do not include exams and quizzes. Students are expected to find alternative childcare during exa ms. Students who plan to use the remote room for the sole purpose of expressing/pumping milk or nursing need to notify the Office of Student Life. Expressing/pumping and nursing in the remote room is permitted when space is not at six -student capacity duri ng the time needed. If remote room is at capacity, students may use unoccupied study space or a designated lactation room. During clinic rotations, nursing mothers are permitted one 30 -minute break per clinic rotation to pump or nurse. Children are not al lowed to attend clinic shifts with parents unless they are being seen as a patient and accompanied by a guardian. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 103 14.10 Mobile Phones, Pagers and Other Electronic Devices Electronic devices with an audible ring or tone must be turned off or silenced during classes, lectures, school -related meetings or in the library. 14.11 Commercial Activities Commercial activities by staff, faculty, students including by not limited to representatives of companies, and any non- campus persons are not permitted unless coo rdinated through the Office of Advancement; this includes room rentals, demonstrations and workshops. Any commercial activities on campus require the preapproval of the Chief of Staff and Strategic Engagement. NUNM is not liable or responsible for any products or services sold on campus or at university - sponsored events. Student representatives of supply companies are not allowed to make announcements advertising their products before, during or after classes. Advertising information may not be placed in student mailboxes. All advertisements must follow the bulletin board policy. 14.12 Higher Education Opportunity Act Peer -to-Peer File Sharing Requirements H.R 4137, the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA), is a reauthorization of the Higher Education A ct. It includes provisions that are designed to reduce the illegal uploading and downloading of copyrighted works through peer -to-peer (P2P) file sharing. These provisions include requirements that: Institutions make an annual disclosure that informs stude nts that the illegal distribution of copyrighted materials may subject them to criminal and civil penalties, and describes the steps that institutions will take to detect and punish illegal distribution of copyrighted materials. Institutions certify to the Secretary of Education that they have developed plans to \"effectively combat\" the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material. Institutions, \"to the extent practicable,\" offer alternatives to illegal file sharing. Institutions identify procedures fo r periodically reviewing the effectiveness of the plans to combat the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials. Annual Disclosure NUNM uses a variety of methods to inform its community about copyright law: At the beginning of each fall term, the NUNM community receives notification regarding illegal distribution of copyrighted materials. This information is also posted on the university's website. Plans to \"Effectively Combat\" the Unauthorized Distribution of Copyrighted Material Steps taken by NUNM to combat unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material include, but are not limited to, the following: NUNM blocks all commonly known P2P ports at the network's border firewall. NUNM blocks all known P2P incoming and outgoing traffic at the network's border firewall. NUNM will respond promptly to all Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notices of unauthorized copyright use. Plan to Offer Legal Alternatives for Illegal File Sharing There are many legal sources for copyrighted material such as music and movies. EDUCAUSE offers an updated website of legal sources of online content at educause.edu/legalcontent . 104 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Review of Effectiveness of Copyright Infringement Deterrence Plan The IT department will monitor DMCA takedown notices to watch for unexpected increases that would require additional measures. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Notice and Takedown Procedures Notice: The Digital Mill ennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Notice and Takedown Procedures document the steps to be followed when the IT Compliance Office receives a complaint from a copyright holder or agent of a copyright holder. NUNM's designated DMCA agent must comply with the prope r form of a DMCA notice as described below. According to the DMCA, a claimed infringement notification must be a written communication (email or hard copy letter) to the designated agent of a service provider. When notifying the NUNM DMCA agent of an alle ged copyright infringement, the following must be provided: A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner, or the person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner; A description of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringe d; A description of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to allow NUNM to locate the material; Information reasonably sufficient to permit NUNM to contact the claimant, including name, address, telephone number and email address; A statement by the claimant that they have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the claimant is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner If the notice is deemed valid, the NUNM designated DMCA agent will proceed with the takedown procedure. 14.13 Marketing and Communications The Marketing and Communications Office is responsible for protecting and promoting the NUNM brand and advancing its reputation as an international leader in natural medicine education, research and patient care. The office oversees marketing and communications brand management for NUNM's markets, a broad cross- section of internal and external constituencies. External and internal communications, print and digital, are coordinated and approved by the Marketing and Communications Office and must adhere to university -approve d branding guidelines as outlined in the NUNM Style Guide. These activities include, but are not limited to: media relations (press releases and media contacts); publications; logos; advertising; university - website content; emergency communications; and market research. Media Contact and Public Outreach To maintain communications and messaging consistency and integrity, students, faculty or staff may not conduct inte rviews, initiate or respond to media requests without prior approval from Marketing and Communications. The department will assess and review the media opportunity, facilitate all media requests, including interview preparation and coordination with NUNM interviewees. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 105 Examples of external outreach include (but are not limited to) preparing and distributing media press releases; managing and responding to media inquiries ; overseeing speaking opportunities about NUNM or the professions of natural medicine ; and representing the university with lawmakers, dignitaries , and other celebrated persons, etc. Marketing 's mission is to convey a consistent, strong, positive message about NUNM and the profession. Use of NUNM Name, Logo or Seal The name, seal and logo o f National University of Natural Medicine are proprietary. They may only be used by persons and associations both within and outside of NUNM who first obtain permission from the Office of Marketing and Communications. Individual departmental or divisional logos are not permitted without prior approval of the Marketing and Communications Office . The Marketing and Communications Office must approve all activities and events whenever the NUNM name or seal is used to promote NUNM, and also all written or graph ic materials that represent NUNM and/or our health centers for display or distribution outside the campus. Examples of such materials include (but are not limited to) university letterhead, business cards, departmental webpages or blogs, email newsletters or print newsletters, social media postings, posters, brochures, press releases, and advertising of public events. The Marketing and Communications Office provides a variety of templates to be used by students, faculty and staff to promote small campus e vents or meetings. The templates promote the NUNM brand by creating and maintaining a consistent and professional public image. All PowerPoint and Prezi presentations created for public use (e.g., to prospective students, for public lectures, professional conferences and symposia) or campus events must be created with NUNM presentation templates to brand the presentation as an NUNM work product. Permissions All students, staff and faculty are advised that NUNM's Marketing and Communications Office takes photographs and videotapes throughout the year. These photographs and videotapes include students and faculty in classrooms and study areas, in clinic, on campus, and at NUNM -related activities and events. This policy excludes students in clinic who are being seen as patients. Students grant NUNM the right to use their image, quotes and comments for use in advertising, fundraising and other marketing purposes upon enrollment.

Social Media Policy and Guidelines Social media provides NUNM an opportunity to communicate and engage with a variety of audiences to promote the university, programs and events. NUNM social media accounts are only to be used for the purpose of communicating and promoting the university and campus, its programs and health centers, institutes and events\u2014and are under the jurisdiction of the university. As such, they are subject to all university policies. Employees may not use university 106 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 accounts as their own personal accounts. Employees' and students' personal social media accounts may not give the appearance of officially representing NUNM. Students, faculty and staff are hereby advised that NUNM.edu, and NUNM's official social media accounts may elect to post and reproduce university -related social media content generated in the public domain and found on Instagram, and other social media platforms. 14.14 Use of Candidate Status in Student Email Signature or Business Cards Due to regulations of the Oregon Office of Degree Authorization (OD A) and the Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine (OBNM), students are not allowed to claim unearned degrees in Oregon. As a state -approved institution of higher education, NUNM is only allowed to confer earned degrees, not candidacy. The use of this termin ology constitutes a violation and can have effects on the accreditation status of NUNM. Therefore, students are not to use the following terminology: \"degree candidate,\" \"ND3,\" \"ND/MSiMR projected graduation date 20 23,\" or similar as part of their email s ignatures, on their resumes and/or business cards. Instead, students are permitted to refer to: The program in which they are enrolled, \"NUNM Naturopathic Medicine Program, Class of 20 22\" The expected graduation class they are on track to meet, \"NUNM Col lege of Classical Chinese Medicine\" A combination of these two things, \"NUNM Master of Science in Integrative Medicine Research, Class of 20 23\" Or, students may refer to themselves as a Naturopathic Medical Student (NMS) or Acupuncture and Oriental Medic ine Student (AOMS) in combination with their class year, such as \"NMS3\" or \"AOMS2\" Students who fail to comply with the policy will be counseled appropriately. Failure to comply after initial counseling will result in a referral to the Honor Council. 14.15 Electronic Communications (Email and Moodle) The official university communication method to students is through NUNM email. Each student is assigned a student email address upon matriculation. In addition, faculty, staff and the administration use ele ctronic communication via course management software (Moodle) to communicate with students. All students must enroll in various department courses in Moodle to access information. Students are strongly encouraged to check their NUNM email account on a daily basis. Students are responsible for the information contained within email communications. Students are responsible for any communication sent via email from faculty, staff and administration. For the clinical communications policies, see the Student Cl inic section. In short, it is NUNM Health Centers policy NOT to use email to communicate with patients. Students who are separating from the university due to graduation, leave of absence, suspension or expulsion will have their access to electronic commu nication discontinue by the following schedule: Students who complete graduation requirements from the university: email accounts remain active six months after graduation. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 107 Students who voluntarily withdraw from NUNM prior to graduation: email account will be disabled 30 days following the last date of enrollment (per Registrar's Office records).

Students with a current or prior positive chest X -ray are required to provide documentation from their healthcare provider, including the following: TB test result Chest X -ray report Determination by the healthcare provider if results are latent TB infection or active TB disease Treatment, including what treatment entails, when started, when complet ed, etc. Students who have active TB disease will be restricted from school and patient contact until certified free of disease, in accordance with CDC and Multnomah County Health Department policy. 2. 10-Panel Drug Screen In compliance with ORS 409- 030-0100, students and residents must obtain a valid 10 -panel urine drug screen and receive a negative result within 30 days of matriculation at NUNM. See the drug testing policy in the student handbook. TB Test Compliance Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly infectious, serious disease that is prevalent among certain populations in the United States and other countries, and presents a significant risk to healthcare workers exposed to patients who may have contracted TB. Healthcare facilities are required to ensure that employees exposed to at -risk populations are free of TB to prevent transmission of the disease. They are also required to identify employees who may have been exposed to TB prior to being hired. NUNM applies this te sting policy to students, employees and volunteers, as the risk of working in a medical setting may be high. Incoming new students, students returning from over one year of leave, and students who have spent more than two weeks traveling to areas of the wo rld where TB is endemic must be tested with the T -SPOT\u00ae TB or QuantiFERON -TB Gold In -Tube blood test, which is to be completed during new student orientation and before matriculation in classes. The TB Spot and QuantiFERON tests demonstrate the presence of antibodies in the blood to the tuberculosis bacteria, indicating exposure, but not necessarily active disease. If an employee, student or volunteer has a positive blood test, they will be asked to have a chest X -ray to rule out active pulmonary disease in order to protect the university community. Students and volunteers must perform the testing, including the chest X -ray if necessary, at their own expense. If the chest film is negative for active pulmonary disease, the individual will be allowed to remain on campus unless they develop clinical signs of active disease. Individuals with active pulmonary tuberculosis will not be allowed on campus until certified free of disease, in accordance with CDC and Multnomah County Health Department policy. The TB Spot and QuantiFERON tests are approved by the CDC as reliable alternatives to the traditional skin testing, and have been adopted by NUNM as its preferred surveillance methods. NUNM reserves the right to change its policy in light of public health developments. In certain clinical rotations, annual testing may be required due to increased risk. NUNM recommends that anyone who has spent time in high -risk countries, or extended time with at risk populations, be 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 111 retested 8 -10 weeks after exposure. A li st of both high- risk countries and at -risk populations c an be found on the CDC website.

This training allows students to obtain skills necessar y to be able to perform as competent entry -level primary care physicians with sole responsibility for patient care as demonstrated through proficiency in demanding clinical and academic programs. Students are given the opportunity to master entry -level kno wledge in differential diagnosis, laboratory and diagnostic imaging interpretation, preventive medicine, botanical medicine, homeopathy, clinical nutrition, physical medicine, musculoskeletal therapies, hydrotherapy, minor surgery, lifestyle counseling, and the use of pharmaceutical medications. Graduating students are given the opportunity to become well prepared for the national licensing exams. CCM Programs In accordance with the CCM mission, students receive lineage -based training that emphasizes transmission and mentoring as major methods for promoting personal and professional cultivation. They have the opportunity to become well-versed in the principles, philosophy , and practice of classical Chinese medicine . Graduates will have demonstrated proficiency of knowledge and skills in Chinese diagnostic techniques, acupuncture, herbal medicine ( DSOM and MSOM only), Asian massage, qigong, Chinese dietetics and l ifestyle counseling. Students also receive instruction in biomedical pathophysiology and recognizing clinical red flags. Graduating students have been trained to assume sole responsibility for patient care, and are given the opportunity to become well -prepared for the national licensing exams, as well as collaborate with other medical providers. MScN Clinical Track Program The MScN clinical track program provides rigorous training in clinical nutrition, providi ng student interns with the practices and procedures related to the nutrition care process. Student interns are allowed to gain knowledge and acquire skills in the performance of nutritional assessment, nutrition diagnosis, nutrition intervention, and nutr itional evaluation and monitoring. They will participate in evaluating the nutritional status and defining the nutritional diagnosis of patients and clients by performing detailed assessments and analyzing laboratory data. Student interns will also desig n evidence -based personalized nutrition plans (PNP) and implement standardized interventions to treat targeted health concerns and reduce comorbidity and disease risk with diet and lifestyle modifications. They will develop nutritional counseling 124 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 and monit oring strategies to improve nutrition outcomes and remedy blocks in the adherence to the PNP. The clinical experience encourages student interns to collaborate and communicate with an interdisciplinary healthcare team, and demonstrate competence in clinic al documentation, including writing referrals for laboratory tests and outside services, requesting medical records, and researching drug -nutrient interactions. Student interns must adhere to HIPAA and professional and ethical clinical guidelines. Graduating students are provided the opportunity to become well prepared for the practice of clinical nutrition and the Certified Nutrition Specialist (CNS) examination. 1.2 Clinical Faculty NUNM Health Centers host both adjunct and full -time faculty memb ers. Each has completed a rigorous application and hiring process, and has been selected based on their clinical acumen measured by their level of expe rience, patient or nutrition client care, expertise and passion for natural medicine, as well as their c ommitment to NUNM 's patients, clients, students and education. 1.3 Student Participation in Clinical Training Attendance at, or participation in , clinical training is permitted only for those students who are in good standing at NUNM . Any student who is suspended or expelled from NUNM is not permitted to attend clinical training sessions or have contact with NUNM 's clinical patients and clients . Any student for whom clinical privileges are suspended is also excluded from attending clinical training sessio ns or having contact with NUNM 's clinical patients and clients. 1.4 Stages of Clinical Training \u2014 ND Program Students assume the role of patient care provider gradually as they progress through well -defined stages with increasing levels of responsibility. Clinical Observation - year one Clinical observations provide students with observational learning experien ces under the mentorship of licensed physicians in practice. During this first -year series, students are assigned to NUNM clinic shifts where they will observe the application of routine clinic policies and procedures, communication between doctor s and student s and between students and patients, diagnosis and treatment discussions , application of therapeutic modalities, and referral management. Hydrotherapy/Massage T echnician - year two In the second year, students are assigned to the role of hydrothera py/ massage technician . At this stage of clinical training, students administer hydrotherapy and massage to clinic patients. This stage provides students with their first hands -on experience treating members of the patient population at our academic medica l clinics, and provides an important introduction to certain aspects of responsibility for patient care. S tudents continue in this role while a vigorous academic schedule prepares them for the next formal stage of clinical training, that of the secondary. Secondary - year three Students become secondaries at the beginning of their third year after passing their OSCE 1 exam. A s econdary functions as an integral member of a patient's treatment team, formed when the attending doctor, and the primary and seco ndary students join the patient in the healing process. The secondary's main responsibility is to observe and learn about all aspects of patient 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 125 care, under the direction and supervision of the physician and in cooperation with the primary, who leads the student team. Secondary duties include, but are not limited to, scrubbin g charts for health maintenance; reviewing medications, allergies and problem lists with the patient; enrolling the patient in MyChart ; assisting the primary intern during patient visit s; contributing to discussions regarding patient assessment and management; and taking vital signs. Primary - year four The final formal stage of clinical training begins after the third year when the student assumes the role of primary, after passing th e OSCE 2 exam. With a fourth -year course load focused on clinical readiness , students are able to devote much of their time to providing naturopathic medical care to patients in the NUNM Health Centers . Primary duties include taking a patient history ; performing an appropriate physical examination and diagnostic evaluation; developing differential diagnoses and a working diagnosis ; and composing an individualized treatment and management plan that includes appropriate preventive recommendations and ant icipatory guidance (in conjunction with the clinical supervisor and secondary). Students receive expert guidance from a diverse group of skilled naturopathic physicians during their primary rotations. Although patient care is coordinated and organized by t he primary, the attending physician oversees each case. As fourth year progresses, students are expected to develop greater clinical skills, to act with more confidence and, in keeping with the clinic's mission, begin to assume a role of responsibility wit h regard to the delivery of naturopathic health care. At no time does the primary act independently without formal authorization from a supervising licensed naturopathic physician. ND Preceptorships/Experiential Learning - all years ND preceptorship rotations afford students the opportunity to follow healthcare providers in practice, providing students with additional exposure to naturopathic medicine, conventional medicine and allied health fields in the surrounding community. Students meeting precep torship program requirements are eligible to begin their rotations in their first year. Requirements for the ND preceptorship component of clinical education are reviewed annually. Entrance into and Advancement through Clinical Training In order for ND students to advance through clinical training, they must meet the following requirements: A. To enter the clinic as a clinical observation student, students must: Pass the urinary drug screen (completed upon matriculation) Have all required immunizations as o utlined in the Oregon Revised Statutes.

The OSCE 1 examination (clinic entrance examination) is taken and passed no more than six months before the student may be allowed to begin secondary rotations. The OSCE 2 examination (primary status examination) must be passed no more than three months before a student is allowed to begin primary rotations, and successful completion of the OSCE 3 examination (e xit examination) is required to graduate from the program. A student is eligible to take the OSCE 3 exam after successful completion of eight primary clinic rotations if they matriculated prior to fall 2015, or after successful completion of six primary cl inic rotations if they matr iculated in fall 2015 or after. 1.5 Stages of Clinical Training \u2014 DSOM and MSOM Programs The goal of CCM clinical training is for students to transform into competent practitioners through the following components of the clinical program. The timing described below assumes that the student is on the four -year track. Clinical observation starts in the third year of the five - year track. Introduction to Clinic - year one In the spring quarter of their first year, students are introduced to the fundamentals of working in the CCM clinics. Topics include HIPAA compliance, clinic policies and procedures, hygienic standards including Clean Needle Technique , charting protocols , patient confidentiality and multicultural awareness. Students learn how to create a patient timeline as preparation for writing patient case reports. Observation - year two In clinical o bservation five students per rotation learn as they watch seasoned faculty supervisors treat clinic patients. Over the course of the year, students become more familiar with clinic policies and procedures, practice the diagnostic skills learned in the firs t year of the program, and relate their classroom learning to the clinical situation. Through their observation of patient - practitioner interactions and their involvement in discussions regarding patient diagnosis and treatment, students build their clinic al knowledge, skills and attitudes, and become familiar with 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 127 the different styles and interests of the clinic faculty. At the discretion of the faculty supervisor, students may participate in the delivery of certain aspects of patient treatment, including moxibustion, massage, cupping and/or needle removal. Students create at least one pat ient timeline on each of their o bservation rotations. Clinical Mentoring - year three In the third year of the program , students continue to gain clinical experience and become more familiar with the different lineage styles of the clinical faculty . Participating in two clinical mentoring rotations per quarter, students become more involved in the process of diagnosing and treating patients under the direction and supervision of the clinician . Students write case reports on patient cases t hey have followed in the clinic. Pre-Internship - year three In spring quarter of the third year, students begin the pre -internship rotation, where they learn the role and responsibilities of the intern by shadowing the current interns. Clinical Case Presentation I -III - year three Students apply their didactic learning to clinical scenarios through case -based discussion and presentation. Internship - year four In the fin al year of the program, students become interns and assume a gradually increasing level of responsibility for direct patient care. They continue to refine their clinical skills and understanding, and build their confidence as proficient practitioners. They become more fully involved in the diagnosis of increasingly complicated cases, and in the creation and delivery of integrated treatment protocols that typically include needle insertion and the prescription of herbal formulas. Students receive training and guidance from a diverse group of skilled practitioners of classical Chinese medicine and are encouraged to choose a clinical mentor , with whom they do at least one rotation per quarter during t he fall, winter and spring quarters . At no time does the intern act independently without formal authorization from a supervising licensed practitioner. By the end of the year, each student will have created a case report on one of their patient cases. Internship Case Presentation I -III - year four Students present their clinic cases to fellow interns and a faculty supervisor for discussion and feedback. Entrance into and Advancement t hrough Clinical Training In order for DSOM and MSOM students to advance through clinical training, they must meet the following requirements: A.

Students take the Introduction to Clinic course in the fall quarter of the first year of their program. Summer and Holiday Internship Each DSOM and MSOM intern is required to work 144 summer hours and 24 holiday hours. The Registrar's Office reserves the right to alter these requirements in conjunction with the school/college director to ensure that sufficient student participati on is maintained to operate the NUNM Health Centers . Clinical Case Presentation I -III Students apply their didactic learning to clinical scenarios through case -based discussion and presentation. Internship Case Presentation I -III Students present their clinic cases to fellow interns and a faculty supervisor for discussion and feedback. 3.3 Patient Contact Requirements Each ND student must participate in a minimum of 510 patient visits at NUNM Health Centers or at an approved, affili ated community clinic. Of the 51 0 visits, 225 visits must be those for which the student serves as the primary. The remainder of each student's patient contacts must be obtained at the clinic, at one of NUNM 's other approved clinical training programs, or on a preapproved preceptor rotation. Each DSO M and MSOM student must participate in a minim um of 350 patient visits at NUNM Health Centers or at an approved, affiliated community clinic between intern and clinical mentorship rotations . A maximum of 72 patient contacts can be obtained on clinical mentoring rotations. 3.4 Additional Requirements for Graduation - ND Case Analysis Papers Students will be required to submit six case papers to their supervising physicians based on clinical c ases that they have managed during their last year of clinical training at NUNM . Students in their final four (4) terms of clinical education will submit one or two case papers per quarter. Cases selected will be from different shifts, and submission will begin in summer or fall quarter of the final year for four -year students. Students on the five - year plan or in the concurrent degree program may spread t he requirement for six case papers over the final five quarters of their clinical education. Case papers are submitted to the student's clinical supervisor on the shift where the patient was seen. Completed papers must be turned in by Friday, 5 p.m. of the end of week 9 of the quarter. This allows time for the supervising faculty to evaluate the paper, return it for corrections if necessary , and submit a grade before the end of the quarter. If the paper is not adequate, the supervising physician will return the paper to the student with comments by the end of week 10 . The student will make the required changes and 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 135 resubmit the paper by the end of week 11 . The supervising physician will evaluate the papers, grade them, and submit the grade forms to the Regist rar's Office with their term grading sheets. Late papers will not be accepted . Students will select cases from their clinic shifts. It is preferable to select cases for which the student has had a follow -up visit. In certain instances, students may select patients to write up that they have seen once, but who were not able to return to the clinic to see that student . In these instances, the student will clear the case selection with their supervising physician on the shift before writing the case paper. Th e physician will determine if the patient is appropriate for the purpose of this educational requirement. Requests for chart copie s must be submitted , on the provided request forms, to NUNM Health Center s' medical records department. Students must allow at least one week for the chart copy request to be fulfilled, so plan accordingly. Clinic al Proficiency Objectives (CPOs) In order to receive credit for clinic al proficiency objectives (CPOs) , students will submit a completed \"Clinic al Proficiency Objective\" form to the Registrar's Office . Forms are available at NUNM Health Center s-Lair Hill and the Registrar's Office . Students may record more than one completed objective on each form, but each objective must be initialed by the supervising physician, as well as having the supervisor sign at the bottom of the form. Students may not receive credit for completing CPOs while working with preceptor physicians, unless the preceptor is also a supervising physician at NUNM Health Center s. The Registrar's Office supplies students with an up -to-date record of completed CPOs at the end of each term. Students are responsible for keeping the yellow copy of the CPO form for their records, and should notify the Registrar's Office of any discrepanc ies between their records and the clinic al proficiency status report. SECTION 4: CONTACT INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS Effective methods of communication between students, faculty members, patients, clinic administrators, and university employees are vital to the provision of high -quality patient and client care and student education. The following policies have been established to facilitate efficient communication with students as they progress through the stages of their clinical education. 4.1 Personal Contact Information Each student's personal contact information (telephone numbers, mailing address and email address) must be accurate and kept up-to-date, especially once a student enters the clinic . Any changes in contact informati on must be submitted to the Registrar's Office, using the \" Change of Address \" form found on the NUNM website. It is the responsibility of the student to verify that change has occurred. 4.2 Campus Mailboxes Students are provided with mailboxes in the Academic Building that are routinely used for hard - copy information sent via NUNM 's inter -office mail and courier system. M ailbox es must be checked regularly and consistently. 136 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 4.3 Student Email and Moodle Student email is NUNM 's primary system for communication. Email is used to relay information about university policies, procedures and programs . Students must check their student email regularly. All academic forms are posted on the registrar's page of the NUNM website . Clinic forms and schedules are available on Moodle under \" Clinic Resources. \" All students are required to maintain a Moodle account, and to check it regularly and consistently. 4.4 Voice mail and Patient Communication NUNM voicemail extensions are assigned to ND primaries and CCM and nutrition interns. These extensions are used for patient, clinic and university communications. Each student is provided with directions for setting up voicemail, and is given a sample message script when assigned a voicemail extension. Each student is responsible for checking their voicemail extension in the following manner: Voicemail messages must be checked at least once every 24 hours. If desired, the IT department can set any student's voicemail to page personal cell phone s whenever a message is r eceived. However, students are still required to check their voicemail regularly, whether a page has been received or not. It is important that no patient call is missed because of phone system inattentiveness. To provide proper patient and client care and for institutional liability purposes, all incoming NUNM patient calls must be routed through the institution. It is against NUNM policy for any student to provide personal cell phone number s as a means of communicating with patients. NUNM is not responsib le for charges incurred for forwarding messages to personal devices. Whenever a student contacts a clinic patient or client, they should have the clinic chart available and know that the supervising faculty member is immediately accessible. All patient and client calls must be charted in the electronic medical record at the clinic within one (1) business day and routed to the attending practitioner for review and signature . Patient and client calls must be returned on the same day if possible, or within 24 hours . This is true even when the patient's or client's concerns cannot be addressed without further research or discussion with the supervising faculty. In such a case, the patient or client must be informed that the message was received and told how the follow -up will occur. When contacting a patient or client via telephone or electronic chart, students may not provide any medical or nutrition advice prior to obtaining permission from the supervising faculty. The student should listen well, ask thorough questions, take good notes, and then contact the supervising faculty member. All advice and care must be under the direction of a licensed practitioner . Full confidentiality and HIPAA -compliance practices must be followed at all times, including when patients and clients are called from outside the clinic. *67 should be used to block outgoing phone number s. Patient and client phone number s should be immediately deleted from the student's cell phone after the ca ll is complete . The manner in which each clinical supervisor manages calls may vary. When there is doubt about the best way to respond to a patient or client call, the student should be conscientious of the policies listed above and check with the supervising practitioner about personal practices, guidelines and requirements. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 137 4.5 Electronic Mail, Social Networking and HIPAA NUNM 's policy on electronic mail is based on HIPAA regulations that govern patient -protected health information (PHI). The current policy is designed to protect the privacy rights of patients and clients, and to protect NUNM against litigation. NUNM does not provide a secure electronic mail system to students, staff or faculty. NUNM uses the OCHIN Epic system for electronic health records. MyChart is the patient and client portal within Epic and is the only approved electronic method to communicate with patients and clients. A student or faculty member may not communicate with a patient or client via NUNM or personal email. Students must use their NUNM email account when communicating with faculty about patients or clients. Students may not communicate with patients or clients on any social network sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) Students may not give any medical diagnostic or treatment information to any other person on a social website. Students may not dis cuss any patient or client cases on social media, regardless of patient de-identification. Failure to follow these guidelines will result in disciplinary action. SECTION 5: SCHEDULING OF STUDENTS FOR CLINICAL ROTATIONS The MScN Nutrition Clinic Rotation is an elective and is subject to the standard policies for academic courses. Student interns should review the current syllabus and s tandards of clinical performance for all requirements necessary for the successful compl etion of the course. 5.1 Clinic Registration Students register for clinic rotations by submitting a clinic registration form (available on the \"Clinic Registration \" Moodle page) to the associate registrar during the clinic registration period following a cademic registration . The registration timeline is announced to all students at the beginning of each quarter . Every attempt will be made to honor students' requests , but this may not be possible. All clinical rotations must have adequate student coverage to ensure quality of patient care. Fixed rotations for primaries and interns (see below) will be assigned before the registration period for the upcoming term begins ; this helps to ensure that class conflicts are prevented. Students have the opportunity to trade rotations with classmates after the clinic schedule s have been posted, as long as the deadline is strictly observed . The deadline to request a rotation chang e is published at the top of all clinic schedules. For more information, refer to \" clinic schedule adjustment period\" under the Add/Drop Policies . 5.2 ND Priority Registration for Primaries The associate registrar schedules ND primary clinic rotations according to a priority registration system that allows all students equal access to the faculty and shift times. Every student is given first -priority status for one quarter of each academic year. The priority registration process optimizes the likelihood that the student will receive most of their requested rotations. However, due to the limited number of spaces available on each 138 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 rotation, NUNM cannot guarantee that every student will be assigned their first choice of clinic rotation. ND students will be required to complete a community clinic rotation in their first - priority term. During another quarter, each student will have second -priority status. Registration requests are scheduled after those of first -priority students. Many students with second - priority status receive requested rotations. During the remaining quarter, the student will have third -priority status. Registration will be scheduled after students having first - and second -priority status. ND students will also be assigned a term in which th ey will be required to complete a Saturday rotation as a primary. 5.3 Add/Drop Policy for Clinic Rotations Students have a three - to five-day schedule adjustment period, after the clinic schedule s with assignments have been posted , to add or drop rotation s without being charged. This provides the opportunity for students to trade clinic rotations. Students must contact the as sociate registrar to coordinate these schedule changes. After the clinic schedule adjustment period, students must use the following procedure to change their clinic schedule: In order to add or drop a clinic rotation, students must contact the associate registrar directly. A final deadline for changes is included on the clinic schedules, posted on Moodle under \"Clinic Resources. \" ND primary and CCM interns who wish to add or drop any clinic rotations after the clinic schedule final deadline must complete the \"Petition to Deviate from Current Policy or Requirements \" form and submit it to the Center for Academic Success. It may then be reviewed by the appropriate academic director (s); a decision will be made, and the student will be notified of the outcome by the associate registrar. While awaiting a decision, students are required to attend all scheduled clinic shifts and adhere to all current clinic policies. All fees concerning clinic rotations will continue to apply. A $50 add/drop fee will be charged for any rotation changes after the deadline. 5.4 Scheduling of Holiday Clinic Shifts NUNM Health Centers recognize holiday periods that correspond with breaks in the academic schedule. Students have a holiday clinic requirement of 24 hours (CCM) or 30 hours (ND) that is fulfilled during these holiday periods. These hours count toward make -up hours and are not part of the total hour requirement. In order to provide continuity of patient care, students are scheduled consistently with their regular clinic schedule as often as possible. Holiday shifts are required for all ND primary and CCM intern students. Students request the weeks that they would prefer to fulfill their holiday requirement in order of preference. Based on this information, the Registrar's Office schedules students for specific days and times. Scheduling is completed in the fall term, in order to allow sufficient time to make holiday travel arrangements. Students are required to attend all of their assigned holiday shifts. Trades are allowed as long as they are communicated to the Registrar's O ffice at least four weeks prior to the clinic shift. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 139 5.5 Scheduling of Special Clinic Opportunities Chinese Medicine Fixed Rotation CCM students have the opportunity to apply to have a fixed rotation with a clinical faculty member of choice. If approve d, students are scheduled for one rotation per term with their mentors throughout fall, winter and spring quarters of their internship year . This focused time studying under the tutelage of one faculty supervisor is found to be beneficial by many students. In many cases, students have the opportunity to request to mentor with the same faculty supervisor who teaches their Traditional M entorship Tutorial classes in the final year of the program. Fixed Rotation Guidelines The fixed rotation is highly encouraged, but optional. The application process for the fixed rotation occurs in the spring term prior to the final year of clinical education. If selected, a student is assured a rotation with that faculty member for three s equential terms (fall, winter, spring). In some cases, fixed rotation s begin in the \"required summer\" term. Students can apply to do their fixed rotation with a faculty supervis or at any clinic location \u2014NUNM Health Centers or the community clinics. If applying with a faculty member who supervises at multiple locations, the student should provide a location preference. To preserve the opportunity for students to work with a variety of practitioners, a minimum of two \"non -fixed\" slots are maintained for each internship rotation. A student may participate only in one fixed rotation . Fixed Rotation Application Process Fixed rotation applications include a simple paragraph or essay regarding the student's desire to work more closely with a specific clinical supervisor . They are submitted directly to the clinic supervisor, who communicates their selections to the associate registrar. Th e associate registrar will notify students of fixed rotation assignment s and coordinate scheduling prior to general clinic registration. Students are encouraged to contact faculty directly for more information about their specialties and practices before applying to work with them. Students may apply to do a fixed rotation with more than one attending physician or supervising practitioner, but if accepted by more than one faculty member, must choose only one. Fixed rotations are scheduled prior to all other clinic scheduling. Fixed rotation confirmations are posted by the associate registrar . Fixed Primary Care ND Clinic Rotations : Each student is assigned two, two -term fixed rotations during their year(s) as primary medical intern. Fixed rotations provide increased mentorship to students, they increase the experience of patient management and follow up, and they improve patient continuity and clinic access. Fixed Rotation Guidelines Students will complete two, two -term fixed rotations during their clinical experience, i .e., four out of 13 rotations (15 for stu dents who matriculate prior to f all 2015) . Ideally, one fixed rotation will be at NUNM Health Center -Lair Hill and the other rotation will be at one of NUNM 's community health centers . For scheduling purposes this is not always 140 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 feasible and students may be assigned two fixed rotations at an NUNM Health Center or two at community clinics. Stand -alone ND students will be registered for one fixed rotation for the first half of the final clinical year (Summer/Fall = SF); the other will be the second half (Winter/Spring = WS) of the year. Concurrent degree (ND/MSOM) students will complete one fixed rotation during their required summer (continuing through fall) and the second fixed rotation in winter/spring of the final year. Final decisions will be made by the registrar and d ean's office , which will attempt to accommodate students' top choices. Fixed rotation placements on shifts will happen prior to first priority clinic registration \u2014 students will automatically be registered for fixed rotations to ensure they do not conflict with required classes. Fixed rotations do not count as a priority term request . Everyone will be registered for fixed rotations and then priority registration w ill proceed after that. As previously mentioned, there are a limited number of fixed slots available per doctor (typically no more than three per rotation ) to allow all students the opportunity to work with a variety of physicians. SECTION 6: CLINIC ATTENDANCE AND ABSENCE POLICIES For each rotation scheduled during the academic year, students are required to complete 12 individua l shifts in order to receive a p assing grade ( 11 during summer term). Up to two absences are allowed during an 11 - or 12 -week rotation , which must be made up before the end of the following term. Students will be given a grade of i ncomplete until those absences are made up. Holidays and unexpected closures due to inclement weather are included in the total number of absences f or that rotation . Exceptions may be made by the school/college director if there are an unusually high number of unexpected clinic closures. In the event of a failed rotation, any patient contacts and hours accrued will be recorded and used as makeup hour s if needed. In the event of prolonged sickness, a medical leave of absence may be obtained. It is the student's responsibility to keep the associate registrar updated on any planned absences or schedule changes. The MScN Nutrition Clinic Rotation is an elective and is subject to the standard policies for academic courses. Student interns should review the current syllabus and s tandards of clinical performance for all requirements necessary for the successful compl etion of the course. 6.1 Clinic Attendance and Shift Tracking Procedure Students track their own clinical hours via the student timesheet provided by the Registrar's Office , which includes an up -to-date list of patient contacts. The student timesheet cons titutes the primary evidence regarding how many shifts were attended and patient contacts were accrued in a given rotation. To track clinical attendance, students must use the following procedure : One time sheet is given per rotation. Students should keep a copy for their own records . Each week, the student enters the time in and time out for the shift, the total hours, number of patient contacts, and maintains a patient log on the reverse side. At the end of each week's sh ift, the student gives the time sheet to the supervisor (faculty or resident) to v erify and initial the hours present and patient log. The supervisor/resident 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 141 will continue to record the student attendance hours and patient contacts in the a ttendance records binder each week. If a studen t misses a week due to a holiday/clinic closure or an absence and makes it up during the same term, those hours are entered at the bottom of the timesheet, and the supervisor from the makeup shift will initial it. At the end of the 12 -week rotation, the s tudent keeps a copy for their own records and gives the original hard copy to the supervisor. At the end of the rotation, the clinical super visor turns in the student time sheets along with their clinical evaluations to the associate registrar. Students who began clinical rotations prior to summer 2017 , and have missed shifts on a rotation for which they have already received a \" P\" grade , will have until graduation to make up those specific misses. This only applies to those specific missed shifts prior to summer 2017. Any missed shifts beginning summer 2017 will r esult in an incomplete grade that must be made up by the end of the following term. 6.2 Clinic Absences Students are expected to attend all clinic shifts . More than two absences per clinic rotation will result in a failing grade . These include days missed because of clinic closures due to inclement weather or holidays. Students are not allowed to \"guest\" on clinic shifts, but must make up all hours missed through substitutions or sche duling extra holiday shifts. During the first week of clinic rotations only illness, bereavement and family emergencies will be considered for approved absences through the associate registrar . All absences, whether planned or unplanned, must be made up by the end of w eek 12 of the term following the absence (or by the end of any holiday weeks that are scheduled immediately following week 12 of a term). Planned Absences These may include vacations and/or seminars. Students must request from their supervisor a planned absence and discuss with them the best way to approach their patients' care, and follow through with the agreed upon plan , if approved. Planned absence notification must be submitted to the associate registrar no less than two (2) weeks in advance using the \"Clinic Substitute Request \" page on the registrar's Moodle page (see Section 6.3 below) . As long as a clinic substitute is found, the associate registrar will notify the faculty supervisor, resident and clinic staff of the ex cused absence. If no sub stitute is found, students are required to submit a clinic absence approval form to the associate registrar with the supervising doctor's signature. If approved, students are responsible for obtaining a substitute unless otherwise a pproved in writing (via the \"Clinic Absence Approval \" form or email) by the supervising practitioner. All absence approvals without substitutes must be submitted to the associate registrar, who will notify the clinic front desk staff or community clinic st aff. The supervising doctor has the authority to approve or deny a planned absence request. A request may be denied if there have been prior absences or if clinic closures are anticipated due to holidays or inclement weather. All miss ed clinical shifts MUST be made up to pass the clinic rotation by the end of the following term. 142 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Appeals Process for Denied Planned Absences If a planned absence request has been denied, the student may appeal the decision by completing an \"Absence Request Appeal \" form and submitting it to the appropriate academic director . Appeals must be received at least 10 business days prior to the requested da te of absence. Students should give themselves a four -week turnaround time on the entire process if they feel as though their absence request may be denied. An absence appeal must be requested before the student takes time off from clinic. It will be approved or denied based on the following factors: the availability of substitute coverage; makeup hours planned; and at the discretion of the clinical supervisor and based on patient care needs. If the request is denied, the student will be expected to attend the shift(s) i n question or the absence (s) will be unexcused. Unplanned Absences These include illness, family emergencies, or attending a birth (for students obtaining a natural childbirth certificate) . In the event of illness or an emergency, students must notify the associate registrar, their faculty supervisor , the resident (if applicable), and the clinic front desk staff (or the community clinic supervisor for a community clinic rotation) via phone or email as soon as possible prior to the beginning of their shift. They must provide a detailed explanation for their absence and leave a telephone number where they can be reached for any necessary follow -up. In the event of prolonged sickness, a medical leave of absence may be obtained ( see Leave of Absence policy in s tudent handbook ). A medical excuse must be provided for shifts missed during the first week of the term. Due to the short notice that typically occurs with such absences, the student is responsible for the following: Contacting the supervising practitioner about the absence. If unable to reach the supervisor directly, the student may leave a voicemail /email message. Notifying the associate registrar , resident (if applicable), and the appropriate front desk staff or community clinic represe ntative of the absence. Reviewing the patient schedule for that day. The student is responsible for consulting with the rotation's supervising faculty to determine which, if any, patients should be rescheduled with the student for another time and which, i f any, patients should be seen that day with an alternate student. This is an important step in quality patient care and it is the student's responsibility to ensure that it happens. When missing a shift to attend a birth (as part of an educational require ment), the student must provide supporting documentation to the associate registrar. If requesting an absence during week 12 (or week 11 during summer term) , arrangements must be made with the student's clinical supervisor to review and sign the final clin ical evaluation. Unexcused Absences An unexcused absence is one in which neither the associate registrar nor the clinical supervisor were informed and the below steps regarding the absence were not taken. These are unprofessional and create hardships for patients, faculty, staff and peers. Students will be referred to the Honor Council and may be docked 20 clinic hours for any unexcused absences. 6.3 Clinic Substitute Procedure Students who will be absent from a clinic shift must enter their absence and r equest for a substitute on the \"Clinic Substitute Request \" page, located on Moodle under \"Clinic Resources. \" 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 143 Once a student signs up to substitute on a shift, they are respo nsible for attending the shift. If a student is unable to attend the shift for whic h they agreed to substitute, that student is responsible for finding a replacement. In either event, all clinic absence policies apply. Failure to find a substitute for a clinic shift will result in an unexcused absence , including docked clinical hours and referral to the Honor Council ( see Section 6.6 below ). 6.4 Inclement Weather and Clinic Closure On occasion, Portland weather can present dangerous traveling conditions. If this happens, administrators may deem it necessary to close the university and clinic (s) for the day. In some cases, when the weather is expected to improve , the university may be closed and classes cancelled, but the clinics may open during the latter portion of the day. Students are expected to pay careful attention to closure info rmation. Unexpected clinic closures are factored into graded attendance unless there are an unusually high number of them. Students should r efer to the emergency closure procedure in the student handbook for more specifics about inclement weather closure n otifications. 6.5 Make up and Holiday Shifts Any student needing additional shift hours in order to convert a grade of \"incomplete,\" or to meet the graduation requirement, can make up the hours by substituting or completing extra holiday shifts. Students c an find makeup clinic shift opportunities on the \"Clinic Substitute Request \" page on Moodle. All hours completed that are not part of a student's regular schedule must be documented on the timesheet for their assigned rotation (if making up hours within the same term that they were missed), or on a \"Holiday Hours and Make up Shift \" timesheet. Timesheets must be submitted by the end of the term in which the hours were completed or they will not be accepted. See Section 6.1 for further detail. 6.6 Tardiness It is both disruptive and disrespectful to supervising faculty, patients and fellow students to arrive late. Students are expected to arrive early and remain through the end of the shift , even if there i s no patient, and to utilize the time in clinic constructively. Students should arrive at clinic at least five minutes before the shift begins and be ready for the shift at the time it is scheduled to begin. Students should take transportation and parking into consideration when planning their schedules. If a student is 15 -30 minutes late to shift or leaves more than 15 minutes early, it will require one hour of shift time to be made up. Tardiness or leaving early by more than 30 minutes will require the en tire shift to be made up. A student may fail a rotation or be referred to the Honor Council for repetitive tardiness. SECTION 7: GRADING AND EVALUATION OF CLINIC ROTATIONS The MScN Nutrition Clinic Rotation is an elective and is subject to the standard policies for academic courses. Student interns should review the current syllabus and s tandards of clinical performance for all requirements necessary for the successful compl etion of the course. 7.1 Grading Students earn graded credit for each of their required clinic rotations. Students are required to complete and pass all of their assigned clinic rotations, even when they have already fulfilled 144 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 their patient contact and ho urly requirements. Clinical rotations are graded using a pass/fail system. Grade of \"P\" (Pass): The student has met the requirements to pass the rotation on their clinica l evaluation and has completed the hour requirements for 12 shifts or more (or 11 shifts during the summer) ; hours may vary depending on program and length of shift . The student may not have missed more than two shifts on their graded rotation, and any misses must be made up as noted in Section 6.2 above . These hours will change accordingly with any future changes to clinic shift length. Grade of \"I\" (Incomplete): The student has met all requirements for passing the rotation according to their final clinical evaluation, but is missing up to eight hours/ two shifts on their timesheet. o Any missed shifts are required to be made up by the end of the following the term. o Shifts made up the following term are logged in the \"Holiday and Make up Shift \" timesheet, initialed by the supervisor for that makeup shift, and submitted to the registrar by the student by the end of week 12 of the term. Once the needed shifts are made up, the registrar will convert the \"I\" grade to a \"P.\" o If missing shifts are not made up by the end of the term following the receipt of an \"I\" gra de, the \"I\" will be changed to an \"F\" (Fail), and the student will be required to complete an additional rotation. Grade of \"F\" (Fail): The student has not met the clinical and/or attendance requirements for passing the rotation. Grade of \"RP\" (ND) or \"R\" (CCM): The student has been required to complete a clinical skills building course (remediation). This grade may be given even if a student has missed up to two shifts during the term, as outlined in the Grading Policies section of the student handbook . If students have more than two absences on a single clinic rotation, they cannot be accurately graded by their faculty supervisor and will receive a failing grade for that rotation. Exceptions may be made in the event of multiple clinic closures beyond th e student's control. 7.2 Clinical Learning Objectives At the beginning of each term, supervising faculty will provide students with an orientation to the rotation by clearly defining their expectations of students, the objectives of that clinic rotation, and the manner in which they will measure student achievement. This orientation is provided so that students have an understanding of their learning objective s on that shift, and the manner in which they will achieve these objectives and be graded on them . 7.3 Evaluation Process Naturopathic Medicine Program Proficiency Examinations ND students are required to pass an OSCE before moving forward in each stage of clinical training. The OSCE 1 examination (clinic entrance examination) is taken and passed b efore the student becomes a secondary intern. The OSCE 2 examination (primary status examination) must be passed before the student becomes a primary intern, and successful completion of the OSCE 3 examination (exit examination) is required to graduate fro m the program. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 145 Midterm Evaluation During the sixth week of each term, students meet with their clinical supervisors to discuss their clinical performance. The evaluation covers clinical skills, knowledge, thought processes and professional behavior. The meetings are designed to give students constructive feedback, identify areas of excellence or concern, and assess students' overall progress in an informal, supportive atmosphere. Week six reviews may be provided to students in written form, but are not tr acked through the Registrar's Office. Final Evaluation Final evaluations of all ND students are conducted during either week 11 or week 12 of each term. Supervising faculty meet with each student individually to discuss their evaluation of the student's p erformance over the duration of that clinic rotation. Student grades are based on the student's overall clinical performance as reflected in their final evaluations. Grades are submitted on the pass/fail grading system . Students must repeat a failed rotation , and the faculty member must document areas the student will need to further develop during their required skills -building course. Evaluation of Supervisors At the end of each quarter, students complete evaluations of their faculty supervisors. The evaluations are reviewed by the director of the College of Naturopathic Medicine with input from the chief medical officer. Classical Chinese Medicine Programs Clinic Entrance Examination All CCM students take a practical point location examination at the beginning of the winter quarter prior to starting their internship year. Students failing this examination are given the opportunity to remediate this exam later in the same term. If the student fails the remediation exam, they must enroll in the Advanced Point Location course in the spring quarter. CCM students also take a written clinic entrance examination during the first half of the spring term prior to becom ing an intern. The written examination covers the foundational course material needed to assume responsibility for direct patient care. Students who fail this examination are given the opportunity to remediate the exam later in the same term. A remediation fee is applied. Should a student fail the written examination for a second time, their entrance into the clinic is delayed for a term, during which the student will have time to address weak areas. Another written exam will be given toward the end of this term. Evaluation of Clinical Rotations Faculty evaluate students during week 6 using a form that assesses achievement of level -specific clinical competencies. They discuss their evaluation with students in a one -on-one meeting, during which they identify any \"critical non -performance\" issues that must be corrected by the end of term for successful completion of the rotation. F inal evaluations of students are conducted during either week 11 or 12 of the term. Supervising faculty meet with each stud ent individually to discuss their evaluation of the student's performance over the duration of that clinic rotation. Student grades are based on these evaluations. In addition, students do a self -evaluation prior to meeting with their clinical faculty memb er. Grades are submitted as pass or fail. Students must repeat a failed shift. Clinic Exit Examination During the final quarter of their training, interns perform an intake and examination on an actual patient or a patient -actor, and then determine a dia gnosis (with differential) and devise a 146 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 treatment approach. Students provide oral and written explanations of their findings and plan. An evaluation rubric is used to grade the student. This practical examination tests whether the student has mastered the level of clinical knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to graduate and become a practitioner with sole responsibility for patient care. Students who do not pass have the opportunity to remediate the exam later in the same quarter. A remediation fee is ap plied. Evaluation of Supervisors At the end of each quarter, observers and interns complete evaluations of their faculty supervisors. The evaluations are reviewed by the director of the College of Classical Chinese Medicine with input from the chief medical officer. 7.4 Clinical Remediation Students who require extra support in meeting minimal levels of clinical competency are counseled and referred for additional instruction by their clinical supervisors or the program 's director . ND Clinical Skills Enhancement Clinical skills e nhancement courses are generally scheduled over a nine -week period of time; students may be referred to this course at any point during the term. The clinical skills enhancement instructor carefully assesses each student's abilities and works with them directly throughout the duration of the course. At the end of the course, the instructor reassesses the student's abilities and determines if the student should continue with the course. A faculty member may require or recommend a clinical skills e nhancement course, even if a student receives a passing grade, if the faculty member feels the student needs additional help to improve their clinical competency. OSCE Skills T utorial ND students who fail an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) twice will be referred to an OSCE skills t utorial for three sessions. If the student passes this course, the student may re -take their exam. CCM Clinical Skills Remediation Clinic evaluations of CCM student performance are done during week 6 of the term to provide midterm feedback and identify areas of weakness, including those that must be remediated before the end of term in order for the student to pass the clinic rotation . The clinical supervisor, in collaboration with the director of the College of Classical Chinese Medicine , can assign remediation work, which can include attendance at weekly clinical skills tutorial labs overseen by the clinical supervisor, director , and/or the AOM resident. SECTION 8: OTHER CLINIC POLICIES 8.1 Confidentiality and Medical Records Each student must hold all information regarding the business of NUNM Health Centers, medical records information, patient interactions and clinical consult ations as confidential. In the course of the student's medical education at any NUNM health center , all information concerning patients, students, staff, employees and physicians should be treated with the same sense of confidentiality. All staff, faculty and students working at the clinics are required to sign a confidentiality statement. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 147 Confidentiality and HIPAA The Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was established to protect patients and clients by preventing the inappropr iate use or transmission of protected healthcare information. Special consideration was given to the technological advancements developing within healthcare professions, and the level of confidentiality associated with ever -changing methods of communicatio n. Students will receive training about HIPAA and NUNM 's confidentiality policies b efore beginning as interns and residents at NUNM Health Centers. As an additional prerequisite to clinical work, students will be provided with NUNM 's confidentiality policy and must agree to uphold the conditions of the policy. Confidentiality and the Rule of \"Need to Know \" In order to provide patient and client services, clinic employees and practitioners have a need to know some patient and client health information. Those affiliated with the clinic in providing patient and client services only access the patient information that they need to know, and only to the extent that they need to know it, for provision of patient and client services. This information is then maintained in strict confidence and is only shared with others who, like them, have a need to know in order to provide services to the patient or client . In order to further protect our patients' confidentiality, discussion of protected information must be avoided in public areas. Please refer to NUNM 's confidentiality policy for more information about confidentiality, HIPAA and protected health information. Breach of confidentiality is an extremely serious violation and may result in immediate termination of a student's educational agreement and/or other sanctions as appropriate. Medical Records All individuals engaged in the collection, handling or dissemination of confidential health information shall be specifically informed of their responsibility to protect patient or client data and of the penalty for violation of this trust. Proven violation of confidentiality of protected information shall be cause for immediate terminati on of access to further data , and immediate termination of any student. This policy shall be made known to all students at the time clinical training begins , and each student shall indicate their understanding and willingness to comply with the policy thro ugh a signed statement at the time of clinic orientation. The statement shall be kept with students' clinical record (see \"Confidentiality Agreement \" form). NUNM Health Centers use the Epic electronic health record system. This system include s patient management (scheduling and billing) and electronic medical record components. In order to maintain a high standard of protection, clinical faculty, students and clinic employees are the only people with access to this secured system. Regarding medical reco rds: The patient and/or client owns the ir chart information and may access any of its content at any time. NUNM is the custodian of the chart. Confidentiality of all health information is legally protected. Requests for medical records not accessible in Epic, on paper and electronic archives, are submitted in writing on chart pull-slips to the clinic services representatives and medical records personnel. Chart pull-slips are used with out -cards to track the paper cha rt's location in th e clinic, and the person responsibl e for the chart, until it is re filed on medical records shelves. 148 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Paper charts and any patient or client documentation are not to be left unattended or in unsecured areas including clinic conference tables. Paper c harts and any patient or client documentation must be kept on clinic premises at all times. Students may request copies of patient or client charts to be used for educational purposes, such as case presentations and theses, by submitting a \" Student Chart Copy Request \" form to medical records. All other chart copies require patient or client authorization for release of information and must be submitted on a HIPAA -compliant \"Authorization for Release of Medical Records\" form by the patient or client . Please ask for these forms through the medical records department. Unauthorized chart copying is illegal and will be handled through the campus judicial process. Sanction may include suspension from the clinic and/or NUNM . In order to further protect the confidential ity of our NUNM community, students must obtain the authorization of their supervising faculty member (on the chart pull-slip) to pull any of the following charts: 1) their own chart; 2) another student's chart; or 3) an employee's chart. 8.2 Professional Attire at NUNM Health Centers The intent of NUNM guidelines for attire and hygiene is to present a safe and professional appearance to patients and their families; it is not to inhibit personal freedom or style. Medical and nutrition students have an important and unique role in the clinical encounter, and appearance has an impact on that role. At NUNM we strive to provide excellent health care. A large part of developing an effective rapport is to make the encounter as comfortable as possible. Many s tudies have shown the impact the appearance of a practitioner has on a patient and clients . Additionally, adherence to NUNM policy on professional attire is a reflection of respect for the faculty. A student who is not in compliance with the below listed policies will be asked to leave the shift , and will lose credit hours as appropriate as an unexcused absence from the shift. The student may return to the shift once the violation has been corrected. Dress Code Policy It is the responsibility of all students, faculty and staff to maintain personal dress and clea nliness consistent with health care and OSHA regulations. Enforcement of these regulations is the responsibility of all faculty, staff and students. The following is the established dress code for all NUNM Health Centers: An NUNM identification badge in a visible location is required AT ALL TIMES. Students must wear clean, neat, unwrinkled , and appropriate professional attire, which includes pressed dress shirt with a tie, dress pants or slacks, dresses, skirts, and close -toed dress shoes. Skirts or dresses should touch the top of the knee or longer when seated. Shirts and blouses must have sleeves. Tank tops or other sleeveless tops are not allowed unless a white coat is worn over the shirt. NUNM has a scent -free (natural and synthetic) policy that must be observed by students (refer to the NUNM university policy for details). Offensive odors, including body odor and strong smelling breath, will be addressed. Earrings are limited to no more th an two per ear, and must be studs or short dangling earrings. Dangling earrings more than one inch long are not appropriate. Holes in 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 149 ears should be limited to 2mm in diameter. A student who has matriculated at NUNM with large ear holes may seek an excepti on to this rule. Ear piercing and single nose piercings with small studs on a single side are permitted. No other visible body piercing, including, but not limited to, tongue piercing and eyebrow rings/bars are permitted. Hair must be clean, well groomed, and worn in a manner that will not interfere with patient care or comfort. Hair past shoulder length should not be able to touch patients. This may mean that it be required to be tied back or kept under a head wrap if necessary. Facial hair must be kept cl ean and trimmed to no longer than one inch, or put into a clip. Hats, with the exception of religious head coverings, are not appropriate. Makeup may be worn in moderation. Fingernails must be kept short, clean, neatly manicured, and not extend more than one-quarter inch past the fingertips. Artificial nails and nail jewelry are prohibited per health department regulations in any patient care role. Artificial nails are defined as any application of a product to the nail to include, but not limited to, acrylic, overlay and tips of silk wraps (does not refer to nail polish). Chipped nail polish is not permitted. Shoes must be closed -toe and non -skid and of low or moderate heel (2 \u00bd inch maximum). Clean athletic shoes may only be worn with scrub attire. Any vis ible tattoos with nudity or expletives must be covered. Other tattoos, that may be considered offensive by patients, may be requested to be covered. Clothing should not expose the chest, abdomen or back. Supervising faculty may have additional dress requir ements as appropriate to their specific shifts. Naturopathic Medical Students (in addition to the above) At NUNM Health Centers, all ND students will wear an NUNM -logo white coat identifying them as part of the provider team. Solid blue or green scrubs ma y be worn by hydrotherapy students. 8.3 Probation and Disciplinary Policy In the event that a student's conduct in clinic is inappropriate, the clinic supervising faculty may document the incident by submitting a n incident report . A copy may be forwarded to the student and other administrators, such as the chief medical officer and /or program director . Clinic ians may, at their discretion, report the following issues and behavior s of any students who they believe have violate d any NUNM rule or policy inclu ding, but not limited to, the following: Arrival to shift unprepared for treatment plan/assignment Missing/late for patient appointment by more than five minutes Missing/late to case preview/review by more than five minutes Not following the clinic absence/substitute policy Being unavailable while on a scheduled clinic shift Acting without the attending physician's permission Not following the clinic protocols/standards Not following the physician instructions Inappropriate dress Unprofessional behavior or conduct such as the following: o Inappropriate remarks o Improper draping 150 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 o Breach of patient confidentiality o Diagnosing/treating a patient without supervising faculty approval o Not following supervising faculty's recommendations o Other professional mi sconduct Violation of, or failure to comply with, any other rules or policies of NUNM Note: Any incident that may violate NUNM 's discrimination and/or harassment policies must be immediately reported , as provided in the Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation, and Title IX section addressed in the student handbook . All non -academic reports are reviewed by the dean of students, with a possible referral to t he Honor Council as outlined in the s tudent handbook. 8.4 NUNM Campus Clinic Parking Policy The parking lot at the clinic is for patients and clients only. NUNM students, staff and faculty may not park in the clinic lot unless they are being seen at the clin ic as a patient, client, or as a customer of the lab or medicinary. 8.5 Internal/ External Referral Policies and Procedures Policy (Internal Referrals) In accordance with its mission to provide outstanding medical and nutrition care t o its patients and clients, and because NUNM Health Centers have extraordinary expertise and talent amongst its practitioners, NUNM Health Centers encourages internal referral s of patients for specific treatments. Procedure (Internal Referrals) If an NUNM Health Centers location uses an electronic health r ecords system, referrals are made electronically. Hard co py referrals are accepted from community clinics that are not on an electronic h ealth record system. Clinical supervisors fill out the NUNM referral form , hard copy or electronic, for all patients and cli ents being referred to other internal departments (e.g., Chinese medicine, IV shifts, physical medicine, homeopathy shifts, clinical nutrition, etc.). Referrals use the SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment and Reason) format for referral or recommendation. Clinicians use this structure to standardize communication. It is required that the treating practitioner communicate findings and treatments to the referring practitioner(s). This is common in private practice and is expected as a basic courtesy by most referring physicians. The physician answers any questions the patient or client may have regarding the internal referral process. For hard copy referrals, any findings and treatments from the treating practitioner are to be summarized in one or two paragraphs and forwarded back to the referring practitioner and primary on a continuous basis in a timely manner. A copy of this communication is kept in the medical record. For electronic referrals, the treating physician will document directly in to the electronic health record. Policy (External Referrals) If an NUNM Health Center location uses an electronic health records system, referrals are made electronically. Hard copy referrals are accepted from community clinics that are not on an electronic health record system. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 151 Each clinical supervisor will ensure that the appropriate referrals o ccur for clinic patients and clients as needed. Procedure (External Referrals) NUNM Health Centers ' referral protocol: The clinic practitioner recommends a referral to the patient or client and sends a referral request to the r eferral coordinator at NUNM Health Centers- Lair Hill. The clinician documents that the referral was recommended and discussed w ith the patient or client in the medical chart using the SBAR format (Situation, Background, Assessment, and Reason for Referral). An electronic referral, p hone call or standard office form is initiated by the Referral Coordinator using the information obtained from the clinician. In the event of the need for a referral, it is the responsibility of the clinical supervisor doing the referral to sign any referral letters or orders regarding the recommended care. The clinical supervisor will fully explain to the patient or client in pe rson why a referral is needed or advised, and will address any concerns. The clinical supervisor will ensure that all documents require d from the patient or client is communicated , and that the referral will not be processed without the required documentat ion. For referrals between NUNM Health Centers , the NUNM fee schedule will be discussed with the patient or client . In the event that the patient or client refuses the referral, it is the clinic supervisor's responsibility to ensure the refusal of referral is documented in the patient's medical chart. 8.6 Referrals for Diagnostic Imaging Policy NUNM has negotiated arrangements with diagnostic imaging companies where uninsured patients and clients can get a discount on certain imaging services when referred by NUNM Health Centers. The amount of the discount is subject to change. Currently, the rate is discounted by 20% at Epic Imaging. If a patient or client has insurance, they will be asked to use it for payment and the insurance company's preferred imaging vendor. Most are contracted with Epic Imaging . To make a diagnostic imaging referral, follow the guidelines below. Procedure Uninsured: Complete the EPIC Imaging referral form completely and give to the medical records department for faxing to EPIC , or give it to the patient or client directly (after making a copy). EPIC referral forms can be found in health center conference r ooms and the Lair Hill \"handout filing cabinet .\" Insured: Follow the same procedure as above , but confirm with the insurance provider that Epic Imaging is acceptable. If not, make the referral to the appropriate imaging center (e.g., Providence requires their plan members to get imagi ng services at Providence ). SECTION 9: CLINIC ROTATION RESPONSIBILITIES The MScN Nutrition Clinic Rotation is an elective and is subject to the standard policies for academic courses. Student interns should review the current syllabus and s tandards of clinical performance for all requirements necessary for the successful compl etion of the course. 152 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 9.1 Time Requirements Most clinic shifts are scheduled in four - or five -hour increments. Care is taken to schedule clinic rotations around required academic courses. Students will need to spend additional time researching patient cases , responding to patient inquiries, and following up with patients outside of the assigned time in clinic. ND Student Clinic Expectations Hydrotherapy technicians can expect to fulfill clinic shift requirements in four (4) hours per week. Secondaries can expect to fulfill clinic shift requirements in five (5) hours per week. Primaries can expect to fulfill clinic shift requirements in five (5) hours per week . Other clinic -related activities such as preceptorship, community education, outrea ch, grand rounds and case reports are not included in these estimates, and should be added to the hourly commitments listed above. CCM Student Clinic Expectations Observers can expect to work in the clinic approximately four hours per week. Clinical m entoring students can expect to work in the clinic approximately 4 -5 hours per week per rotation. Pre-internship students can expect to work in the clinic approximately four hours per week per rotation. DSOM and MSOM interns can expect to work in the clini c approximately 5 -6 hours per week per rotation, for a total of between 2 -4 rotations per quarter. 9.2 Clinic Preview and Review Students report to assigned clinic shifts prior to the shift start time by gathering in a conferencing area where patient assignments for the shift are given. In preparation for the shift, the attending physician, resident or practitioner conducts a case preview session in which cases for the day are briefly discussed. Once case preview is completed, students begin their patient visits under the direct supervision of the clinical faculty me mber to whom they are assigned. The clinical supervisor oversees all student clinical activity while the student is on shift, and although the intern has responsibility for patient care, autho rization from the clinical supervisor is always necessary before the student proceeds with exams, treatment plans or other integral components of patient care. At the conclusion of each clinic shift, a case review session is held, during which clinical sup ervisors and students discuss the day's cases. Students' prompt arrival at clinic shifts is imperative. Tardiness will result in the loss of clinic hours (see Section 6. 6 Tardiness) . 9.3 Student Scope of Authority Students are authorized to participate in clinical activities, including care and treatment for patients in NUNM Health Centers and NUNM community clinics, including but not limited to, taking patient 's history, performing physical exam s, and participat ing in diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of patient care , which is directed and supervised at all times by an attending physician or practitioner. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 153 9.4 Time Management on Clinic Rotations In order to best serve patients during their appointments, it is the responsibility of students and clinical supervisors to be on time with patient appointments. Proper time management reinforces the development of good practice -building skills. It is especially important to be on time with the last appointment of the day to ensure proper and timely clinic -closing procedures. The clinical supervisor will decide how much and how long the case discussion should occur in front of the patient, and how much should be in the privacy of the clinic conference room. The clinical supervisor ensures that case discussion with each student is as timely as possible, so that the patient is not left unattended for more than 10 minutes. No patient should wait for any service related to their visit for more than 10 minutes, with the exception of waiting for an herbal formula to be filled. 9.5 Maintaining Safety in the Clinic Setting In the event of an emergency, accident or security issue, students are required to contact their clinical supervisor or clinic administrator immediately. The appropriate code as noted in the Acute Care Emergency Manual should be initiated as soon as possible. NUNM Emergency Contact Numbers 911 for police, fire or medical emergency After -Hours Security Pager - 503.830.3613 Exposure Control Officer - 503. 380.7694 Facilities and Safety Supervisor - 503.552.2014 Evening/Weekend Security Guard - 503.830.3613 First Response Security: after -hours alarm response and security service - 866.686.1886 After -Hours Physician On -Call pager - 971.266.9344 Please refer to the \" NUNM Acute Care Emergency Manual \" book for specific emergency response procedures. For the safety of all clinic community members, it is vitally important that each student be familiar with the potential health risks of clinical me dicine and the proper protocols for lessening those risks. Any procedure that involves breaking the skin creates an opportunity for exposure to infection. Appropriate precautions must be used whenever there is a potential for exposure to blood, other bodily fluids (e.g., saliva, mucus, weeping lesions) or body tissues. Due to a possible risk of exposure to body fluids, students, faculty and staff must adhere to the following guidelines in all clinical treatment areas (treatment rooms, laboratory areas and medicinary): No food or beverages are to be present Avoid having to insert contact lenses, apply makeup, brush teeth or do any other personal procedure that unnecessarily exposes mucus membranes to potential infection Clinical treatment areas must be equipped with appropriate sharps containers and biohazard containers Areas must be fully stocked with gloves and other personal protective equipment at all times Closed -toe shoes must be worn at all times by clinicians while seeing patients Hand -washing fa cilities are available either in the room or an immediately adjacent room 154 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Hand -washing is the most important single procedure for preventing infection in a healthcare setting. Hands should be washed according to current standards for medical providers: Before and after each patient After contact with blood or body fluids, or obvious environmental contaminants At the end of a treatment or procedure After maintaining personal hygiene All students should be aware and conscientious when performing any and all clinical procedures \u2014from inserting acupuncture needles or performing an exam, to cleaning and disinfecting the treatment room afterwards. Special care must be taken to avoid accide nts. In the event of an accident, the clinical supervisor must be contacted immediately and the blood borne pathogen exposure protocol should be initiated. The protocol is as follows: use the online incident reporting system to record the exposure and the individual involved. Contact the CMO (contact information is available in the online incident reporting system and in the hardcopy needle stick packets). Follow the instructions in the hardcopy needle stick packet, available in every clinical conference room. Needle stick packets are also found behind the clinic front desk and in the clinic hallway near the acupuncture supply cabinets. Needle stick packets can also be found online through the \"Exposure and Incident Forms\" link at the bottom of every page of the nunm.edu website. Each health center is equipped with first aid kits, an AED (defibrillator), body fluid spills kit, biohazard bags and containers, and fire extinguishers. The clinics also house OSHA manuals and MSDS manuals for reference. Personal p rotective equipment (PPE) is provided by the clinic for laboratory, minor surgery and other procedures where the potential for exposure is high. Specific CCM Safety Needs NUNM classical Chinese medicine safety protocols are based on, and wholly consistent with , the information in the most recent \"Clean Needle Technique for Acupuncturists\" manual. Please refer to the most recent CNT manual for current information and instruction about the following: care of instruments, pain or tra uma upon insertion, pain after insertion, positioning the patient, skin disinfection, depth of needle insertion, safety and electrica l stimulation, and moxibustion. Acupuncture Needle Protocols Some of the most common clinical tasks facing CCM students ar e the insertion and removal of acupuncture needles. Handling needles may be hazardous; students should work with them slowly, carefully and cautiously. Insertion of acupuncture needles: Care must be taken to avoid contamination when removing needles from the sterile packaging. Needles must not be touched by the bare finger during insertion. All opened needles, whether or not they have been used, must be discarded in the sharps container as they are no longer sterile. For this reason, needle packages should be opened only at the time of use. Gloves, finger cots and cotton balls should always be available to prevent exposure of the hand that places pressure on the insertion site. Disposal of used acupuncture needles: Disposable needles must immediately be di scarded in sharps containers. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 155 Needles should not be gathered in small bunches as they are removed; they should be dropped individually into the sharps container directly after they are removed. Alternatively, they may be transported to the sharps containe r in a kidney basin or other impervious container. Used needles should be handled as little as possible in order to minimize the possibility of an accidental needle stick. Use of m oxibustion: Patients must be thoroughly counseled regarding the procedure, risks and alternatives , and be given time to ask questions prior to the use of moxibustion. Extreme care must be taken when lighting and using moxa in the clinic. Treatment doors must remain closed during and after moxa treatment. Fireproof bowls are provi ded and must be used when lighting and transporting moxa. Moxa sticks and matches must be extinguished and disposed of properly. Failure to follow appropriate safety guidelines may result in disciplinary action. 9.6 Maintaining Cleaning Standards in the Treatment Room After each and every patient visit, the students and clinician(s) who treated the patient are responsible for cleaning the treatment room in accordance with the following protocols. These are institutional protocols that have been set to me et federal and state safety regulations. General Cleaning Treatment rooms should be left clean, tidy and ready for the next patient and clinician. Used exam table paper should be removed. Table paper is thrown in the garbage if it has not been contaminate d with body fluids. If it has been contaminated with body fluids, it must be discarded in the biohazard container in the treatment room. Used linens are removed in accordance with the following instructions: o Linens such as towels and sheets that have not b een exposed to body fluids are to be placed in a green laundry bag. These bags are located in the linen storage areas on each floor of the clinic. o Linens that have come into contact with body fluids or open wounds must be sealed in a biohazard bag and plac ed into the regular laundry sack for proper processing. Students are advised to use good judgment in these scenarios. Linens that are saturated with a patient's body fluid require this process. Linens with a small drop of blood do not. The faculty supervis or should be consulted if there is any question. Biohazard bags are stocked in each patient treatment room. When the green linens bags become full, it is the students' responsibility to transfer the bags from their stations throughout the clinic to the la rge, green rolling bins in the general storage area on the first floor. Be certain that any garbage in the room ends up in the garbage bin, not the biohazard container. Be certain that all biohazard waste ends up in the biohazard container. Tidy up counter areas, shelving units and cabinets in treatment rooms by returning medical supplies to their original spot. Return shared clinic equipment to appropriate storage location, so that the next person can find it. Clean surfaces by wiping them with Caviwipes. 156 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/11/2020 Instruments All disposable instruments and materials that have come into contact with body fluids must be properly disposed of in the appropriate biohazard container. All non -disposable instruments that need to b e cleaned and sterilized for re use must be placed in the Cidex bucket to be cleaned and autoclaved by the clinic staff. o The Cidex bucket is located on the counter in the clinic operations hallway. Gloves Gloves must be worn any time there is a reasonable possibility of hand contact with blood, bo dy fluids or broken skin (exposed tissue). Gloves that have been contaminated with body fluids should be immediately removed and placed in the biohazard can located in the treatment room. Care should be taken to avoid touching anything in the treatment roo m with the gloves. When students need assistance with depositing the gloves in the biohazard can they should ask a fellow student, faculty member or clinic staff for assistance in the treatment room. They should not leave the treatment room with the gloves . Contaminated gloves are not to be worn outside of the treatment room under any circumstances. Use of Caviwipes as Disinfectant Caviwipes are the disinfectant used to clean and decontaminate treatment rooms and common areas throughout NUNM Health Centers . Students are required to disinfect treatment rooms and surfaces that may have been exposed to contamination. This should include the following times: At the beginning of every clinic rotation At the end of every clinic rotation Any time there is visible body fluid contamination The following application procedures must be followed completely in order to ensure proper, effective disinfecting ; and meet OSHA standards : Every surface that may have been exposed to or come into contact with body fluids, includ ing sneezes and coughs, must be disinfected. When body fluid contamination is visible, disposable gloves should be worn for the clean -up process. If body fluid contamination is not visible on a surface, it is not necessary to wear gloves while disinfecting . When body fluid contamination is visible, that surface should be cleaned with Caviwipes first. When an NUNM -approved tuberculocidal disinfectant is not available, a chlorine bleach solution should be used to disinfect as follows: o The solution should be 10% chlorine bleach and 90% cold water o The solution must be fresh (i.e., made within the past 24 hours) o All surfaces should be sprayed with chlorine bleach solution and left wet for five minutes All treatment room doorknobs should be treated with Caviwipes at the end of every clinic rotation. If there has been any potential for exposure, clipboards used in the treatment room should also be cleaned with Caviwipes. 2020- 2021 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 12/ 11/2020 157 Pediatric Area Cleaning In recognition of the more sensitive nature of our pediatric patien ts, a hydrogen peroxide antimicrobial disinfectant is used instead of Caviwipes to clean the surfaces in the pediatric - designated clinical areas. Body Fluid Spills Each clinic is equipped with a kit to be used for cleanup of major body fluid spills. The faculty supervisor or a clinic employee can be consulted for information about its location. If further instructions are necessary, an MSDS book is available at NUNM Health Centers. Burnt Materials (Moxa) Stainless steel b owls must be used to hold and extinguish burning materials in the treatment room. Moxa extinguishers should be used for moxa sticks whenever available. Give burnt materials sufficient time to cool thoroughly in the stainless steel bowl before being emptied into the trash. Cups (for Chinese medicine cupping treatments) Students are to place cups into the Cidex bucket on the counter in the pass -through hallway for cleaning by the clinic operations coordinator. 9.7 End of Clinic Shift Checklist 1.
