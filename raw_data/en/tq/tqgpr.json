Many rebrandings of the same phenomena include complementary medicine (CM), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), integrated medicine or integrative medicine (IM), and holistic medicine. Alternative treatments all have one thing in common: they are based on pseudoscience rather than medical research. When traditional techniques are employed outside of their intended contexts without sufficient scientific explanation and proof, they become \"alternative.\" New-age or pseudo are often used disparaging words for the alternative, with little differentiation from quackery.

Naturopathic physicians are doctors who operate in the field of complementary and alternative medicine. Prevention strategies, holistic therapy, and a blend of traditional and Western medical practices are the focus of these sorts of doctors. While naturopathic physicians may write prescriptions, they prefer to use natural treatments. Everything from digestive problems to chronic pain to allergies and cancer is treated by them. They can conduct simple surgery, but they rarely undertake big procedures. Minor surgery is usually seen as minimally invasive. Alternative medicine doctors can be found in hospitals, private clinics, and community health centers. Adults and children can use their services. Homeopathy and herbology are two more disciplines of medicine where a holistic medicine practitioner might specialize.

The following are some of them: - Ayurveda - Homeopathy - Naturopathy - Traditional Chinese medicine Mind-Body Medicine Mental and emotional variables influence physical health through a system of interdependent neuronal, hormonal, and immunologic linkages throughout the body, according to mind-body medicine. Behavioral, psychologic, social, and spiritual strategies are employed to improve the mind's ability to influence the body, hence preserving health and preventing or curing sickness. Biologically Based Practices Biologically based methods influence health by utilizing naturally existing chemicals. Here are some instances of these practices: - Botanical medicine and natural products - Chelation therapy - Diet therapies Manipulative and Body-Based Practices The primary focus of manipulative and body-based techniques is on the body's architecture and mechanisms (eg, bones, joints, soft tissues). These practices are founded on the idea that the body can self-regulate and repair itself, and that its many components are interconnected. They include the following: - Chiropractic - Massage - Reflexology - Cupping - Gua sha (eg, scraping, coining, spooning) - Moxibustion Energy Medicine Energy medicine aims to influence health by manipulating subtle energy fields (also known as biofields) hypothesized to exist in and around the body. All energy therapies are founded on the notion that the body contains a universal life force (qi) or subtle energy. A vital force has been proposed in the past to explain biological processes that were not fully understood. This power faded away as biological science evolved. Some researchers are still looking into the presence of the biofield and subtle energies. Energy medicine is used in a variety of treatments, including the following: - Acupuncture - Magnets - Therapeutic touch - Reiki Eligibility Criteria The eligibility criteria vary for pursuing a degree in any alternative medical course.
