Here's what you can do to protect yourself from viruses \u2014 and what won't help, such as supplements.", "sitename": "Healthdirect Australia", "date": "2020-03-09", "cleaned_text": "Many Australians are anxious and stressed about the [COVID-19 coronavirus](/covid-19). You might feel a little powerless, but there are a few things you can do to help strengthen your [immune system](/immune-system) and help protect yourself from many types of [viruses](/bacterial-vs-viral-infection). And none of them involve a hazmat suit. Do vitamin pills protect you from the coronavirus? No. It's much better to get all the nutrients you need for a strong immune system from a [balanced diet](/balanced-diet). And with a couple of exceptions \u2014 [folic acid](/folate) for pregnant women, for example \u2014 most healthy people do not need to use expensive supplements. Social media has been infiltrated by claims that megadoses of vitamin [supplements](/dietary-supplements), such as intravenous [vitamin C](/vitamin-c-and-your-health), can treat the flu-like [symptoms of COVID-19](/covid-19/symptoms) but there is no evidence to back this up. Consuming high doses of certain supplements, such as [vitamin A](/vitamin-a-and-your-health) and [vitamin D](/foods-high-in-vitamin-d), can in fact be toxic. Vitamin C is water-soluble, which means it's not lethal but if you consume more than your body can store, it's simply removed via your urine. So, excess vitamin C literally goes down the toilet. A COVID-19 vaccine isn't yet available in Australia because the health regulator needs to be sure any vaccine is both safe and effective. The government hopes to begin a vaccination program \u2014 starting with priority groups, such as older people and healthcare workers \u2014 in early 2021. Stay up to date with the [Department of Health website]. Get more sleep [Sleep](/sleep) is important for your immune system. Research shows that sleep-deprived people can have suppressed immunity, meaning that they're more at risk of catching viruses. If you feel worried or you are [anxious](/anxiety-related-disorders) (about COVID-19, for example), you're more at risk of [sleep problems](/sleep-disorders) such as [insomnia](/insomnia). And if you're sleep-deprived, you're more likely to be anxious.

Clean your phone As well as keeping you up at night, your phone may also transfer germs. According to a [new study](https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext#sec3.1), some viruses (including [human coronaviruses](/about-coronaviruses) that came before COVID-19) can remain infectious on surfaces for up to 9 days. So you should disinfect the ' [portable petri dish](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-how-behaviour-can-help-control-the-spread-of-covid-19-132247)' that is your mobile phone regularly with a cleaning product that is 70% ethanol.
