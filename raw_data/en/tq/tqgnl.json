Finding the perfect dose of a supplement can make you feel like Goldilocks\u2014with so many options and little guidance on what's best, it can feel like you have to try everything out first. Ashwagandha, a popular herb, is no exception. It comes in a wide range of doses, and unfortunately, there isn't much research to tell us what dose is best. Learning more about this herb can help, though. Let's dig in! What is ashwagandha? Since you're here, you likely already know that ashwagandha is an adaptogen, a plant that is believed to help your body deal with different kinds of stress and improve your overall well-being. But you may not know that the ashwagandha plant or Withania somnifera\u2014also called Indian ginseng or winter cherry\u2014has a long history of use in Ayurvedic, Indian, and African traditional medicine. Traditional practices like Ayurveda used the root and berries of this plant to treat a wide range of health conditions, and modern research is finding evidence to support some of these uses. The potential [health benefits](https://ro.co/health-guide/benefits-of-ashwagandha/) of ashwagandha are surprisingly wide-reaching. Ashwagandha root is considered a drug of \"Rasayana,\" a Sanskrit word that translates to \"the path of essence.\" It's a practice of Ayurvedic medicine that refers to the science of lengthening lifespan. It's fitting to describe this rejuvenating root this way. Many different systems in your body have to operate at their best for you to live a long, healthy life\u2014and potential ashwagandha benefits range from cognition to joint health.

Benefits of ashwagandha Animal studies and clinical trials suggest that ashwagandha supplements such as powders and root or leaf extracts ( [Mandlik Ingawale, 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32242751/)): - May boost [testosterone](https://ro.co/health-guide/ashwagandha-testosterone/) - May boost [male fertility](https://ro.co/health-guide/male-fertility/)by increasing sperm count - May reduce blood glucose (blood sugar levels) - May reduce chronic stress - May lower cortisol levels (stress hormone) - May reduce [anxiety](https://ro.co/health-guide/ashwagandha-for-anxiety/)and depression - May decrease inflammation - May increase muscle mass and muscle strength - May help lower cholesterol - May improve [sleep](https://ro.co/health-guide/ashwagandha-for-sleep/) The effects of ashwagandha are thought to come from compounds called withanolides.

Ashwagandha forms Although you can find ashwagandha in powder and elixir forms, there's a reason you'll mostly see capsules and pills in health stores and online. The word ashwagandha is Sanskrit for \"smell of the horse\" referencing the herb's ability to increase strength\u2014and its unique smell. Ashwagandha powder can be blended into hot beverages or smoothies, but you may need to experiment with ingredients to mask the supplement's unique flavor and smell profile. For those who want to bypass that potential hurdle altogether, capsules and pills are easy alternatives and widely available. [](https://ro.co/health-guide/who-should-not-take-ashwagandha/) Is ashwagandha safe? Who should not take it? Ashwagandha doses The right dose for you may depend on what you're taking ashwagandha to address. Studies across different health concerns have used doses ranging from 125 mg of ashwagandha extract all the way up to 5 g ( [Mahdi, 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19789214/)). In most cases, the [ashwagandha dose](https://ro.co/health-guide/ashwagandha-dosage/) was broken up so that the participants took the herbal supplement 2-4 times a day instead of all at once. But there is no specific recommended dose for ashwagandha root extract ( [P\u00e9rez-G\u00f3mez, 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7230697/); [Raut, 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23125505/)). If you look at supplements from the average company on the shelves of your local health store or online, you'll see a wide range of daily suggested doses ranging from 150 mg-2 g. Lower amounts tend to be used in supplements that use multiple ingredients to address a specific health concern. The higher doses are mostly found in ashwagandha-specific supplements. To hit these ranges, most brands have you take between two and three capsules each day shortly before eating or with a meal. Starting low will help you gauge tolerance, and you should discuss the upper range with a medical professional. You may want to start with one pill or capsule a day to see how you react and slowly add capsules until you're taking the full suggested dose. It's also worth noting that most experimental studies looked at effects over the course of 30 days, though in some cases, positive outcomes were noted earlier. Give your supplement time to work before deciding whether it's a treatment worth continuing.

Ashwangandha is also part of the Solanaceae or nightshade family, so those following a diet that eliminates this group of plants (including tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants) should avoid taking this supplement.
