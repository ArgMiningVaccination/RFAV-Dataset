The investigators recently proposed a conceptual framework to illustrate how health information technology can be used to bring social determinants of health information into primary care. In this paper, they describe how they are putting this conceptual model into practice within the OCHIN network of community health centers by highlighting examples of ongoing research, identifying knowledge gaps, and outlining a roadmap of future research to move the field forward.

In this study, the investigators sought to assess the association between discharge multimodal analgesia and postoperative pain outcomes in two diverse health care settings. They evaluated patients undergoing four common surgeries associated with high pain in electronic health records from an academic hospital (AH) and Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The investigators found that a majority of surgical patients received a multimodal pain approach at discharge yet many received only opioids. Multimodal regimen at discharge was associated with better follow-up pain and all-cause readmissions compared to the opioid-only K, Carroll I, and effectiveness of multimodal discharge analgesia management.

This study compared sepsis 'time zero' and CMS SEP-1 pass rates among 3 abstractors in 3 hospitals. Abstractors agreed on time zero in 29 out of 80 cases, and the perceived pass rates ranged from 9 to 19 out of 80 cases (23%). The authors conclude that this variability in time zero and perceived pass rates limits the utility of SEP-1 for measuring quality. AHRQ-funded; HS025008. Citation: Rhee C, Brown SR, Jones TM .

Guidelines, Quality Quality Measures, Sepsis Modi PK, Kaufman SR, Borza T Variation in prostate cancer treatment and spending among Medicare shared savings program accountable care organizations. This study assessed whether the level of engagement in accountable care organizations (ACOs) by urologists affected rates of treatment, overtreatment, and spending. The investigators found that ACOs vary widely in treatment, potential overtreatment, and spending for prostate cancer. ACOs with stronger urologist engagement were less likely to treat men with a high risk of noncancer mortality, and this suggests that organizations that better engage specialists may be able to improve the value of specialty care.

This study tested the plausibility of a theoretical model of change for the Penn Resiliency Program (PRP), a cognitive-behavioral (CB) depression prevention program for adolescents. The authors assert that when effective, PRP's CB training provides incremental value over non-specific components and there are indirect effects on depressive symptoms through improvements in explanatory style.

This study examined the association of post-hospitalization processes of care at hemodialysis facilities with pulmonary edema-related and other readmissions. The study results suggested that some interventions performed at the dialysis facility in the post-hospitalization period may be associated with reduced readmission risk, while others may provide a potential existing means of identifying patients at higher risk for readmissions, to whom such interventions could be efficiently targeted.

JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics 2018; 2):1-13. objective was to develop a frailty index for older patients and apply it to a subset of patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The study used the Rockwood Accumulation of Deficits approach for the Medicare Health Outcomes Study (MHOS). Data from over 2 million patients without cancer older than 66 years of age from SEER-MHOS linked databases were compared to the cohort with multiple myeloma. It was found that among patients without cancer, each 10% increase in the frailty index was associated with a 40% increased risk of death. For the multiple myeloma cohort, each 10% increase in the frailty index was associated with a 16% increased risk for death. Median time for overall survival was only 26.8 months for patients considered frail, compared with 43.7 months for those who were not. This frailty index could be used a predictor of overall survival in older multiple myeloma patients.

Non-persistence may be a significant barrier to the use of metformin. The objective of this study was to assess reasons for metformin non-persistence, and whether initial metformin dosing or use of extended release (ER) formulations affect persistence to metformin therapy. The investigators concluded that their data supported the routine prescribing of low starting doses of metformin as a tool to improve persistence.

The authors of the study propose a marginalized two-part Beta regression model which captures the zero-inflation and skewness of microbiome data and also allows investigators to examine covariate effects on the marginal (unconditional) mean. They demonstrated its practical performance using simulation studies and applying the model to a real metagenomic dataset on mouse skin microbiota. AHRQ-funded; HS020263.

In this study, researchers systematically evaluated the most recent evidence in the literature to (1) review the different types of technological tools used for self-management of sickle cell disease, (2) discover and describe what self-management activities these tools were used for, and (3) assess the efficacy of these technologies in self-management. They concluded that despite the promising feasibility and acceptability of eHealth interventions in improving self-management of sickle cell disease, the evidence overall is modest. for children, adolescents, and adults with sickle cell disease: systematic review.

Variations in measurement periods were associated with variation in performance between clinics for 3 of the 4 eCQMs, but did not have significant differences when calculated within clinics. Variations from standard measurement periods may reflect poor data quality and accuracy. AHRQ-funded; HS023908. Citation: Colin NV, Cholan RA, Sachdeva B .
