Since our inception in 1807, our students, faculty and leaders have made numerous advances that have dra-matically and measurably impacted and improved people's lives. Our research has not just been \"theoretical science,\" but has always had a patient-centered focus. For example, in the first half of the nineteenth century, former Maryland dean, Nathan Smith, MD, invented the splint for leg fractures. In 1900, James Wright, class of 1892, further devised a stain, now called \"Wright's stain,\" that is used to differentiate blood cells. J. Whitridge Williams, class of 1888, pio-neered investigations into obstetric complications and first published a textbook (in 1903) which would become one of the leading obstet-rics reference texts used by medical students and practitioners today. In 1941, Theodore Woodward, class of 1938, showed that one dose of typhus vaccine was protective against the disease. John C. Krantz, Jr., PhD, head of the department of pharmacology from 1932 to 1965, revolutionized the world-wide practice of anesthesiology. As time has progressed, the pace of our discoveries has accel- erated, and we have been much more purposeful in conducting research that will directly lead to new treatments, therapeutics or approaches for fighting diseases and chronic conditions. Myron Levine, MD, (profiled in this issue) and James Kaper, PhD, developed and tested the first live oral cholera vac- cine in 1994. That same year the first aromatase inhibitors to treat breast cancer, now the standard therapy to treat post-menopausal breast cancer, were developed by Angela Brodie, PhD, distin-guished professor of pharmacology, who is on the verge of another breakthrough in prostate cancer treatment. In 2012, Stephen Bartlett, MD, and Rolf Barth, MD, led the team who com- pleted the most extensive full-face transplant to date. Last year, an advisory committee for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the \"green light\" to continue development of a drug to treat radiation exposure from a nuclear meltdown or terrorist attack, based on the research conducted by Ann Farese, MA, MS, and Thomas MacVittie, PhD. To further our mission of discovery-based medicine, which has rapidly become the school's raison d'\u00eatre, we have configured the academic units conducting basic, translational and clinical research to have multiple and intertwined roles. Currently, we have almost the same number of institutes, organized research centers, and programs as we do departments, and it is not by chance that we are organized in this way. Through the school's roadmap for the next decade, Vision 2020, we have implemented a series of initiatives to promote, support and emphasize discovery and innovation that will impact our patients, our students and our trainees. The accelerating innovation and discovery in medicine initiative (ACCEL-Med) is just one example. ACCEL-Med is a structured, potent and aggressive framework for research. It was introduced to enhance and ensure that we excel in \"big science\"\u2014the burning issues of modern medicine that have baffled, befuddled and blocked our peers from successfully treating certain conditions such as brain disorders (see the profile of Bankole Johnson, DSc, MD, MPhil), cancers and chronic and infectious diseases. The research featured in this issue of the Medicine Bulletin represents just a small sample of the breadth and depth of the cutting-edge work conducted by our exceptional faculty. This work will also be show-cased at the \"2014 Festival of Science: Infections, Inflammation and Vaccines,\" a day-long scientific symposium celebrating our robust biomedical research portfolio. While we only have enough space to highlight a select number of projects, such as the work in HIV/AIDS by Robert Gallo, MD, I commend all of our faculty whose tireless efforts will truly transform human health.

In a symbolic gesture to celebrate the 200-year anniver - sary of the 1814 Battle of Baltimore, University officials approved the measure in September, and within a few days the flag was raised. \"Davidge Hall is the oldest surviving icon of early medical education in America, and it was here during the battle,\" said MAA president George Boyer, '83. \"We share the universi-ty's excitement over the decision to fly the flag over this historic build-ing.\" Davidge Hall was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997. Historic Flag Waves Over Davidge Hall Transitions Myron M. Levine, MD, DTPH , has been appointed associate dean for global health, vaccinol-ogy and infectious diseases. The appointment becomes effective in January 2015, after Levine transitions from his current role as director of the center for vaccine development (CVD) which he co-founded and has led for 40 years. In his new role, Levine will expand the scope and depth of the school's involvement in global medicine. It is currently involved in research and service in 34 countries. A national search to find the next director of the CVD has been launched. EVENTS news&advances Medicine Bulletin Fall 2014 [4] Planned Giving Your Legacy... It's Personal Dr. Ronald J.

Alan Schmaljohn, PhD Alan Schmaljohn, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology at Mary-land spent decades studying the Ebola virus as chief in the viral pathogenesis and immunology branch with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. He is a lead figure in Maryland's partnership with the Depart-ment of Defense contract recipient Paragon Bioservices in the manufacture of an Ebola virus vaccine for initial safety testing in humans. \"Several vaccine candidates for Ebolavirus are proceeding through initial manufacture toward safety testing in human volunteers,\" Schmaljohn says. \"Different vaccine candidates are based upon different 'platforms' in which selected viral proteins Schmaljohn at Forefront of Ebola Vaccine Development may be made 'in the test tube' and purified for injection, or may be added genetically as passengers of a different variety of virus that is weakened. Only human trials will provide the final answers as to which vaccines are best on the basis of many criteria, foremost being safety and efficacy,\" he adds. Schmaljohn was originally one of the leaders in deter - mining what kinds of immune responses are required for protection against viruses like Ebola, and he was part of the team that first identified antibodies capable of protecting certain animals from Ebola virus. \"Subsequently,\" he adds, \"three of these antibodies have been developed as a candidate mixture for human therapy against Ebolavirus, which is apparently true for an Ameri-can who was infected with Ebolavirus during the current outbreak.\" However, he cautions that many scientific ques-tions remain unanswered. New Microbes Linked to Severe Diarrhea In a finding that may one day help control a major cause of death among children in developing countries, a team of researchers from Mary-land and the University of Maryland, College Park has identified microorganisms that may trigger diarrheal disease and others that may protect against it. These microbes were not widely linked to the condition previously. \"We were able to identify interactions between micro-biota that were not previously observed, and we think that some of those interactions may actually help prevent the onset of severe diarrhea,\" says O. Collin Stine, PhD, professor of epidemiology and public health at the medical school. A much better understanding of these interactions is important, Stine adds, as they could lead to possible dietary interventions. Moderate to severe diarrhea (MSD) is a major cause of childhood mortality in developing countries and ranks as one of the top four causes of death among young children in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Stine and Mihai Pop, associate professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park led the six-year project funded by $10.1 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The research results were pub-lished in the journal Genome Biology. The researchers used high- throughput 16S rRNA genomic sequencing to examine both \"good\" and \"bad\" microbiota in samples taken from 992 chil-dren in Bangladesh, Gambia, Kenya and Mali under the age of five who were suffering from MSD. They identified statisti- cally significant disease associations with several organisms already implicated in diarrheal disease, such as members of the Escherichia/Shigella genus and Campylobacter jejuni. They also found that organisms not widely believed to cause the disease, including Streptococcus and Granulicatella, correlated with the condition in their study. In addition, the study revealed that the Prevotella genus and Lactobacillus ruminis may play a protective role against diarrhea. In addition to the Gates Foundation, the study was also supported partly by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and The Wellcome Trust. [ 7] University of Maryland Medicine Bulletin Fall 2014 [6] edicine requires a solid foundation in basic and translational research science. Without microbiologists studying the components of bacteria, viruses and parasites, we would not fully appreciate the world of microbes. Without immunologists studying the nuances and intricacies of our innate and adaptive immunity, we would not have life-saving vaccines. In this issue devoted to research, we celebrate some of the basic, translational and clinical research at Maryland devoted to understanding, treating, preventing and eradicating infectious and chronic diseases. The Virus Hunters and Vaccinologists Christopher Plowe, MD, MPH Professor, Department of Medicine Leader, Malaria Group Associate Director for Research Training, Center for Vaccine Development Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Malaria is a preventable mosquito-borne parasitic disease that affects over 200 million people worldwide, and killed an estimated 627,000 people in 2012. Plowe, leader of the Malaria group in the school's center for vaccine development, and his research team are working to reduce the health burden malaria presents for people in some of the poorest countries. His group studies drug-resistant malaria and is developing a vaccine for the disease. The research has taken Plowe from his laboratory in Baltimore to field sites in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Caring for and collecting samples from infected patients, the laboratory team has analyzed the parasites and gained a greater Infections...Inflammation...Immunity... Innovation: How Maryland Research Will M Revolutionize Medicinediscovery/ research By Julie A. Wu, PhD appreciation for the genetic diversity of the microorganism. The diversity of Plasmodium has prevented investigators from developing a successful and broadly-acting vaccine, and has allowed the parasite to develop resistance to current treatments. However, teaming up with genomics and proteomics experts, Plowe's group has developed assays that can look at thou-sands of malaria genes and at human antibody responses to hundreds of malaria proteins at once. Using information from these new studies may help the Plowe research group to track drug resistance and to develop better vaccines against the parasite. Malaria Infected Red Blood CellMyron M. Levine, MD, DTPH Simon and Bessie Grollman Distinguished Professor, Department of Medicine Director, Center for Vaccine Development Although vaccines recently introduced into many developing African countries are diminish-ing childhood mortality, during the first four to five months of age, before vaccine-induced antibodies are present, infants are vulnerable to infections. One way to protect this age group is to immunize their mothers in the last trimester of pregnancy to stimulate the produc-tion of high titers of maternal antibodies that can cross the placenta and can confer protection to the newborn. Decades ago, this approach was successfully used to protect neonates against tetanus toxoid, acquired due to unhygienic umbilical cord cutting and care. Buoyed by this success, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation sponsored large-scale controlled field trials to assess the effectiveness of immuniz-ing third-trimester pregnant women with influenza vaccine to protect infants up to six months old. Recently in Mali, a sister institution to the school's center for vaccine develop-ment (CVD), which is overseen by Levine, completed a large-scale, randomized controlled trial immunizing 4,192 third-trimester pregnant women against influenza. Prelimi-nary results revealed that maternal immunization prevents confirmed influenza in young infants. These positive results are stimulating global interest to assess the role of maternal immunization in protecting infants against other infections such as pertussis and Respiratory Syncytial Virus disease. (See profile on page 18) Karen L. Kotloff, MD Professor, Departments of Medicine and PediatricsHead of Infectious Disease and Tropical PediatricsAssociate Director of Clinical Studies, Center for Vaccine Development Medicine Bulletin Fall 2014 [8] Kotloff, a pediatrician with a long-term interest in global health and infectious dis-eases, is a key clinical investigator at the CVD and department of pediatrics. Kotloff has had the opportunity to make a major impact on two significant public health issues: enteric (diar - rheal) diseases in developing countries, and pandemic influenza outbreaks. Kotloff served as the clinical and epi-demiologic study lead for the Global Enterics Multi-Center Study (GEMS), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foun-dation. GEMS was an intensive study of diarrheal diseases among children from seven developing countries in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Through GEMS, Kotloff and her collaborators gained greater insight into the different enteric pathogens infect-ing children, and their impact on child health and survival in devel-oping countries. Kotloff also heads the University of Maryland Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU), one of nine such units supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Kotloff and the VTEU investiga-tors test many vaccines of public health interest, including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine, as well as the H7N9 influenza vaccine in 2013. Under Kotloff's leadership, the Maryland VTEU received another 10 years of funding from the NIH last year. Aaron P. Rapoport, MD Gary Jobson Professor in Medical OncologyProfessor, Department of MedicineDirector of Lymphoma Gene Medicine, Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center Blood and bone marrow cancers, such as chronic myelog- enous leukemia (CML) and myeloma, are typically treated with chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplant. However, the risk of relapse or secondary infection is high because patients' immune systems are suppressed during treatment. Using an approach pioneered by Dr. Carl June at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Rapoport takes patients' own immune cells, activates and expands the cells in the laboratory, and then gives the cells back to the patients to restore immune func-tion. In collaboration with June, Rapoport's team used this [ 9] University of Maryland peutics for autoimmune diseases. Within the cancer treatment arena, he co-invented a vaccine designed to restore the immune system's ability to recognize and destroy tumor cells. After completing phase I and early phase II clinical trials at Maryland, Gliknik Inc., licensed this cancer vaccine for possible further clinical studies. Strome's work in autoim-mune diseases centers on the development of broadly acting anti-inflammatory agents that promote self-tolerance. A primary treatment for some immune disorders is intrave-nous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a blood product containing antibodies extracted from the plasma of healthy donors, which suppresses inflammation. However, IVIG is in short supply. Strome conceived an idea, and Gliknik Inc., gener - ated a therapeutic to counteract the immune system's attack on the self, without the need for human plasma donors. Gliknik Inc., entered into a significant licensing agreement with Pfizer to further test and develop this drug. Robert C. Gallo, MD Homer & Martha Gudelsky Distinguished Professor, Department of Medicine Director, Institute of Human Virology In the 30 years since Gallo and his research team dis- covered interleukin-2, a factor that promotes the growth of T cells and was essential to his subsequent discovery of human retroviruses, and co-discovered human immu-nodeficiency virus (HIV), much has been learned about HIV , how to screen for it and how to control it. Gallo, who directs the school's institute of human virology and technique to treat four patients with CML, one of whom is in remission more than 15 years after the initial procedure. They also have tested this procedure in approximately 150 patients with myeloma, and have completed four clinical trials and are in the midst of conducting a fifth. Through this work, Rapoport and his colleagues have learned how to rebuild immune function after autologous stem cell transplantation. Recently, they have begun to genetically modify the immune cells to \"redi-rect\" them against the patient's own myeloma tumor cells. Scott E. Strome, MD Chairman and Professor, Department of Otorhino-laryngology-Head & Neck Surgery A core goal for the school's research is to transform dis-coveries made in the laboratory into thera-peutics administered in the clinic. Strome has successfully taken promising drug candidates for cancer from the \"bench to the bedside,\" and has worked with Gliknik Inc., a biotechnology company that he co-founded, to advance potential thera-discovery/ research H1N1 Influenza Virus Particles Healthy Human T-Cell Medicine Bulletin Fall 2014 [10] [11] University of Maryland co-founded the Global Virus Network, has made significant contributions to understand-ing all human retroviruses, and his work has dramatically reduced the worldwide burden of HIV/AIDS. However, a vaccine that can stop HIV transmission has remained elusive. There are many reasons why attempts to develop an HIV vaccine have been unsuccessful. One is that HIV \"lives\" in the immune system using active and functional T cells to subsist. Because vaccines induce a protective antibody response, which also depends on activated T cells, any anti-HIV antibodies produced in response to a vaccine also increase the amount of virus-infected T cells. The research team of Gallo and Drs. George Lewis and Anthony DeVico remains undaunted in its pursuit of solving this challenging dilemma and is currently working to develop a vaccine can-didate. Gallo also is part of the HIV Cure group, dedicated to unraveling mechanisms which could eradicate functional HIV activity from the human body. (See profile on page 18) The Investigators of Inflammation Stefanie N. Vogel, PhD Professor, Department of Microbiology and Immunology Vogel's laboratory focuses on the earliest host-pathogen interactions that occur during viral and bacterial infec- tions. They are interested in how these interactions transmit cellular signals to macrophages, a type of white blood cell. The Vogel laboratory also works to identify ways to interfere with the development of inflammatory immune responses, mediated by a class of signaling molecules known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which may cause damage to the host. Recently, they have begun highly translational studies exploring whether drugs developed to treat one disease could be repurposed to intervene in other inflammatory diseases. For example, based on their experiments that implicated TLR4 in influ-enza, the research team used a TLR4 antagonist, Eritoran, to block acute lung injury or lethality in two rodent models of influenza infection. Eritoran was originally developed to treat sepsis, but failed in Phase III clinical trials. However, Dr. Vogel and her collaborators have discovered a poten-tial new purpose for this drug. Additionally, through their studies of specific macrophage signaling pathways involved in Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), the Vogel research team identified two FDA-approved drugs that may drive the development of a subset of macrophages that resolve inflammation and lung injury caused by RSV . Achsah D. Keegan, PhD Professor, Department of Microbiology and ImmunologyCenter for Vascular and Inflammatory Diseases Keegan has a familial connection to the medical school and University of Maryland\u2014both her grandfathers are Maryland graduates, one from the medical school (Ben-jamin Henry Dorsey, class of 1901), and the other from College Park. When her previous research laboratory had to move, she gladly came to the medical school and was among the first of the researchers located in the Biopark in the center for vascular and inflammatory diseases. An immunologist, Keegan is interested in Type II inflammation, the type of immune response elicited by parasite infections or by allergens, such as pet dander or food, and is charac-teristic of allergic asthma. Work in her laboratory focuses on the mechanism by which two cytokines that control allergic inflammation, interleukin (IL)-4 and -13, mediate their effects in the lung. Using an animal model of allergic asthma, Keegan's research team examines how IL-4 and -13 control the responses of macrophages and eosino-phils to house dust mite, a common household allergen. Her group found that IL-4-activated macrophages enhance eosinophilic inflamma-tion by a process dependent on the transcription factors STAT6 and Egr2 and modulated by the adaptor protein insulin receptor substrate 2. Targeting these pathways may alleviate allergic asthma symptoms. Terez Shea- Donohue, PhD Professor, Depart-ment of Radiation Oncology coexisted with enteric patho-gens\u2014bacteria, viruses and other parasites\u2014for thousands of years. The importance of the microbiota of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is under - scored by observations that an imbalance or absence of certain populations of microorganisms can affect human health. Improvements in sanitation and hygiene in the past five decades have resulted in a decline in infection of the GI tract by parasitic nematodes, round worms that colonize both the small and large intestine. Research conducted by Shea-Donohue and her colleague, Aiping Zhao, MD, focuses on the mechanisms by which immune responses triggered by nematode infections could benefit human health. People infected with nematodes produce cell signal-ing molecules that reduce inflammation in the GI tract and counteract the immune responses typically elicited by diseases such as diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, and multiple sclerosis. Shea-Donohue and Zhao have observed that nematode infections alter intes-tinal function and protect against experimental models of inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and obesity. They are currently identifying and characterizing both the biologi-cal mediators of these responses as well as the nematode-generated products that to therapeutic potential in GI-relevant pathologies that could be used in lieu of nematode infection. Stephen N. Davis, MBBS Theodore E. Woodward Endowed Chairman and Professor, Department of Medicine Although diabetes causes significant problems for patients, its comorbidities, including vascular, eye, kid-ney and nerve disease, can dramatically impact quality of life. Davis' research focuses on understanding large vessel disease in people with diabetes, particularly as this pertains to the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Based on clinical studies of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as non-diabetics, the Davis laboratory hypothesizes that inflam-mation causes adverse vascular biologic conditions, disrupts endothelial cell and large vessel function, and leads to heart attacks and strokes. They have observed that very high glucose as well as low glucose cause acute inflammation and significant arterial dysfunction in people with diabetes. Most surprisingly, the Davis research team has found that low blood glucose causes greater inflammation and significantly increases a patient's risk for a heart attack, compared with high blood glucose. Additionally, they have discovered that, in the presence of very high glucose, insulin seems to play an anti-inflammatory role in people with diabetes. Insulin has been thought to cause vascular inflammation, but findings from the Davis laboratory suggest that insulin may modulate inflammation, and that glucose, especially low blood glucose, could be a major cause of inflammation. discovery/ research HIV-infected T-cell Caenorhabditis ElegansMedicine Bulletin Fall 2014 [12] [13] University of Maryland attempting to care for the thousands of residents stricken, seemingly at once, throughout the city. By mid-September most people with any financial means to leave the city had departed, including physicians. There were no nurses to be found, even though nursing was not a trained profession. Those who were willing to care for the ill were offered competing and exorbitant rates that ranged anywhere from $3 to $5 a day, plus room and board, making the salary equivalent to that of the congress-men who had fled the capitol. Accounts of the breakdown of social ties abounded in diaries, letters, and the one city newspaper that continued to print. One pregnant woman died in labor, neighbors unwilling to enter her house where her husband lay unbur - ied, dead of fever. Paragons of bravery in the Revolutionary War, like Captain Sharp and Commodore Barry, retired to their country homes, permitting no one to approach on pain of being shot from a distance, including their own family members. Sickening scenes of death were encoun-tered on streets, as servants and boarders were turned out in the midst of illness, left to die in gutters or alleys. Social breakdown in the face of medical uncertainty caused bedlam in 1793, but one erroneous belief produced some of the most heroic figures of the epidemic. Noting that people of African descent seemed immune to the fever, Philadelphia's mayor called upon the beleaguered black community\u2014too poor to escape the dying city\u2014to assist with basic care in the community. The leaders of the African Society responded with overwhelming charity. Women like Sarah Bass labored 20 hours a day cooking, nursing, laundering putrid linens, and fetching water for dozens of stricken white community members for no fee. One des-titute former slave named Sampson went free of charge from house to house, coordinating black nurses, burying the dead, and rescu-ing children who were alone and scared after their parents had taken ill or died in their homes. Within two weeks, it was obvious that black community members were as susceptible as whites to the fever, yet the African Society's efforts continued unfailingly, bringing order and organized care to the city. In Powell's words, during the epidemic \"panic was as conta- gious as sickness, as revolting as the black vomit, as formidable as death itself.\" As yellow fever began to spread beyond the borders of Philadelphia on the heels of refugees, it was clear that no city in the United States was prepared for the social breakdown that resulted when epidemics arrived in the growing American cities. Those who survived the epidemic recognized the importance of an organized American medical system that was absent in colonial America. In direct response to this outbreak, every major city in the United States began movements to create physician-manned boards of public health, whose responsibili-ties included staying and organizing care in crises. Physicians also cited the epidemic as a reason to create the first American schools of medicine, like the University of Maryland. That investment in public medical education reaped direct rewards, as a little over a 100 years later a University of Maryland medicine graduate, James Carroll, class of 1891, and colleague Walter Reed proved through experimentation on Carroll himself that the female Aedes aegypti mosquito is the vector of yellow fever. No cure exists for yellow fever today, but national cam-paigns for the control of the mosquito in the mid-20th century largely eliminated the pool of vectors throughout the United States and contained the virus decades before the discovery of the vaccine. The emergence of virulent diseases like ebola and West Nile Virus urge us to consider the power of public fear as well as the social aspects of infectious diseases that contemporary medicine is still struggling to understand, cure, and control. Diseases do not live solely in the host or in medical laboratories, they are also social phenomena whose impact can change the course of history. \"A Fever of a Very Alarming Nature\" Ebola? Try the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 About the author: Mary Ellen Leuver is a doctoral candidate in the History of Science & Medicine at Yale University specializing in bioethics and the history of infectious diseases. She consults on medical history at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. n epidemic of yellow fever closed the federal government of the United States in the nation's capitol of Philadelphia from September to November 1793. It was the first time yellow fever had come to Philadelphia in a generation. By the end of the four-month outbreak, 15 percent of the 45,000 Philadelphians had died while another 20,000 fled in panic, taking refuge in the countryside or in other eastern-seaboard towns. Despite Philadelphia's prominence as the center of American medical inquiry, in a matter of weeks the nation's second-largest city (at the time) was largely abandoned due to the appearance of a disease whose causes were passionately debated but frustratingly unknown. As medical historian J.H. Powell described the accounts of those living through the epidemic, \"in the continual failure of the doctors, even the bravest men lost hope.\" In the fall of 1793, for the first time in American history, a government body appealed to a medical orga-nization to ask for guidance as a \"fever of a very alarming nature\" swept the city. While 18th-century medicine still largely relied on the therapeutic armamentarium of the Middle Ages, new techniques such as inoculation for smallpox and quinine had brought hope that modern medi-cine could understand, treat, or even prevent some of the deadliest diseases that had plagued humanity throughout history. Of the 80 medical doctors in Philadelphia, physician Benjamin Rush's treatment using quinine bark, calomel, and copious bleeding of a pint or more of blood a day gained prominence. For Rush, the process worked: it slowed the rapid pulse and ceased feverish fits, seemingly calming and sedating the patient. What it did not prevent, however, was the rancid black vomit of the patients nor did it counteract the deepening yellowing and drying of the skin or the alarming irritation and bleeding of the eyes. These symptoms created horrific sickrooms for families {Perspective } By Mary Ellen Leuver At right: Reed's letter to Carroll upon learning of his recovery from yellow fever.Diseases do not live solely in the host or in medical laboratories, they are also social phenomena whose impact can change the course of history. [15] University of Maryland Medicina Memoriae Medicine Bulletin Fall 2014 [14] Aside from his artistic and religious interests, what may now draw our closest attention to Spence is that he died shortly following his 100th birthday in the fall of 1915. For several years leading up to that occasion, notices were published in the Baltimore Sun about the exact state of the old man's health: when it was up, when it was down; when he felt well enough to go to meetings and take part in civic activities, or when doctors\u2014including William S. Thayer of Hopkins\u2014were rushed to his crowded bedside. When he turned 98 in October of 1913, the Sun reported that he liked to boast of how he would live to age 100, and that he \"enjoys three hearty meals a day, sleeps well and takes daily exercise in all good weather.\" The newspaper also stated that he was \"very fond of a glass of buttermilk in the middle of the day...and smokes four cigars a day and enjoys them, too.\" Spence's 99th birthday a year later was prominently reported, and when he turned 100, on October 18, 1915, journalists pulled open every stop about a visit to Spence from Baltimore's mayor, about the \"bower of roses and chrysanthemums\" that spilled out from bedroom into reception rooms of his house on St. Paul Street, and about the wee basket of heather, bracken and thistle given him by a group of local Scottish-Americans. Yet Spence himself pointedly told the Sun's reporter that he \"was not quite so certain this year as he was last that he will live to celebrate another anniversary.\" The old man was nothing if not a planner: he was dead on November 3. How much attention would such a life, or such a well- timed exit, attract today? The number of centenarians has been growing rapidly since the middle of the 20th century, and by 2010 there were an estimated 80,000 persons over age 100 in the USA alone\u2014far too many to receive individual greetings from Willard Scott. The share of population represented by centenarians has reached 1 per 6,000 in developed countries, a near-doubling since 1980, according to the New England Centenarian Study being conducted by Boston University's School of Medicine. An additional category has even been established, \"super-centenarians,\" for those who have experienced their 110th birthdays. Yet the pace of mortality for those over age 100 remains high: the U.S. Census Bureau has determined that fewer than 1 percent of those who get to 100 will go on to celebrate 110. What can be generalized\u2014if anything\u2014about the qual- ity of life for this swelling mass of centenarians? According to James P. Richardson, '80, who also holds a master's of public health degree and is chief of geriatric and pallia-tive medicine at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore, the extreme elderly are often those who can \"feel the joy in their lives regardless of circumstances.\" Even as age and illness have reduced their mobil-ity and limited their sensory input, simple activities such as visiting with family and listening to books on tape tend to be felt as great pleasures. They are content with what they have rather than what they don't have. Centenarians also tend to be those who handle stress well\u2014stress of whatever kind, ordinary or extreme. Their patient profiles are associated with diminished rates of those degenerative con-ditions that often make life miserable for people who are merely in their 60s and 70s. One of the more curious findings of cen-tenarian research is that women who reach age 100 are often those who have had pregnancies-to-term as late as age 40 and then delivered with few complications. In the words of the Boston University study, \"health span equals lifespan\"\u2014as with William Wallace Spence's three hearty meals every day and exercise in all good weather. Among men, effective response to the extreme stress of combat may also serve as a predictor of living to age 100. During the past several years, the last confirmed veterans from World War I have died at great ages: the American soldier, Frank Buckles, at 110 in February 2011; the last soldier to experience trench warfare, Englishman Harry The Joy of a Century Author Wayne Millan has been working behind the scenes of Maryland's historical CPC for nearly two decades and currently teaches Classical Latin at the George Washington University. William Wallace Spence was a familiar figure to Baltimoreans of a century ago. He had emigrated from Scotland as a young man in the early 19th century and built a successful career within his new city's growing community of wholesale mer - chants. Spence's particular specialty was sugar, yet he was also a principal founder of the Mercantile Bank and an early investor in local railroads. During his middle and later years he donated both time and money to various charitable organizations. The magnificent church now known as First & Franklin Presbyterian was to a great extent his creation. Among Spence's other physi-cal legacies is an over-sized marble statue seen by several generations of Baltimore physicians and patients, the Christus Consolator still on display in the central foyer of the Administration Building at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Spence's donation was intended to show Christ as \"healer\" and \"comforter.\" It had been copied by Theobald Stein of the Royal Academy of [Danish] Arts from an earlier work by Scandinavian artist Bertel Thorvaldsen; the original remains today in Copenhagen's Protestant Cathedral, Vor Frue Kirke. Spence's six-year-old great-granddaughter Emily was chosen to unveil Baltimore's version in 1896 to great attention from local press. The gift and the prominence given to Baltimore's Christus\u2014which cost Spence the equivalent in today's money of at least $150,000\u2014helped to allay fears felt among the city's more conservative reli-gious groups that the Quaker-founded Hopkins would be excessively secular in its outlook. Patch, at age 111 in July 2009; and the last verified combat veteran, sailor Claude Choules (English, later Australian), who was 110 years old when his life ended in May 2011. All of these men reported good qualities of life and few medical complaints even past age 100, and most were still able to communicate, had few signs of dementia and were involved in the larger community until just a few days or weeks prior to their deaths\u2014much as Spence had been a century earlier, when the Great War was only at its bloody start. Spence's good meals may have helped him reach a great age, as did his reportedly good sleeping habits and a healthy bank account. More recent studies such as those con- ducted by the Boston University group have consistently shown that healthy modes of life combined with genetic predisposi-tion\u2014e.g., is there a sibling who has also lived a century?\u2014are shared by most of those who have passed their 100th and by nearly all who have reached their 110th. The second-best predictor of great age, however, is one that neither Spence nor vet-erans like Buckles could have aspired to: owning two X chromosomes. Above 80 percent of today's centenarians are women, and at least 90 percent of supercen-tenarians are women as well. Who was the very last documented World War I veteran? Her name was Florence Green, and she had joined the (British) Women's Royal Air Force a few months before the Armistice was agreed to in November, 1918. Green was 110 years old when she died in February 2012. By Wayne Millan the extreme elderly are often those who can \"feel the joy in their lives regardless of circumstances.\"[17] University of Maryland Medicine Bulletin Fall 2014 [16] commissioner's award from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its childrens bureau's office on child abuse and neglect.

Kathleen Tracy, PhD John LaMattina, MD Sandra Mooney, PhDMedicine Bulletin Fall 2014 [18] [19] University of Maryland discovery/research In research, triumphs are made of the collective products of those whose vision is driven by the pursuit of discovery. Such is the uncompromising path taken by Maryland scientists, among them Drs. Robert C. Gallo, Myron (Mike) Levine and Bankole Johnson. There are those who cite the contributions to science of Robert Gallo, MD, as the most important in the last generation. Gallo, the Homer and Martha Gudelsky Distinguished Professor in Medicine, professor of microbiology and immunology, and director of the institute of human virology, reports one of the toughest prob- lems in the history of virology is an AIDS battle still being waged. He believes it's one that can be won. \"The retrovirus can establish itself as a per - manent infection within a few days,\" he says. \"We need to find a way to block the virus prior to the infec-tion. I have come to the conclusion that this is a solvable problem. But we have yet to solve it.\" He explains that the antibodies that attack the virus are short-lived. He and his colleagues currently are working on a way to compensate for their short lifespan. It is typical of the scientist who discovered the HIV virus as the cause of AIDS and the blood test that deter - mines its presence to speak of this remaining struggle without minimizing its severity but with resilience to overcome it. It is no surprise that Gallo had an early interest in researching blood diseases. The drug program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute which became effective for pediatric leukemia patients was developed after his six-year-old sister lost her life to the disease. Years later in 1979, while working at the NIH, Gallo and his team discovered the first known human retrovirus, one that causes a specific kind of leukemia. His laboratory also discovered the second known retrovirus. After these discoveries, and because of the characteristics of the viruses, the team speculated that it seemed likely the AIDS virus was due to a closely related virus. It appeared to be the call to arms for which Gallo was waiting, and led to the discovery of HIV , the third known retrovirus. By 1996, his scientific achievements led to his being named by Science magazine as the most cited scientist in the world between 1980 and 1990. In 1996, following 30 years at the NIH, Gallo founded the institute of human virology at Maryland. By that time, he had proved HIV to be the cause of AIDS, developed the blood test to diagnose the disease, discovered the first known retrovirus and the molecule, Interleukin 2, which for the first time enabled the growth of T-cells in the laboratory. Today, Interleukin 2 is being used to treat both cancer and some immune disorders. After Gallo delivered the James Joyce Lecture in Dublin, Ireland, a member of the audience questioned him about the problems virologists face in confronting the unchecked viruses responsible for millions of deaths annually. Gallo digresses momentarily to mention that the lecture is one that both Winston Churchill and Harry Belafonte had previously addressed. He becomes more serious as he relates that the remark from the audience questioned if science could have \"done it better.\" Gallo didn't have to think long before finding a possible answer in the Global Virus Network, a coalition he founded of renowned virolo-gists from more than 20 countries, dedicated to finding the answers to the mysteries behind killer viruses and develop-ing the drugs to prevent or cure them. Gallo today serves as scientific director of the network. \"We need top experts in every kind of virus that infects humanity,\" he says, \"and they must work collaboratively in training future generations of researchers.\" This is the direc-tive of the Global Virus Network and one to which Gallo is wholeheartedly committed to bringing individual talents focused on global issues. The institute of human virology has, from the start, been funded by the State of Maryland, NIH, Centers for Disease Control and subsequently the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as by several additional funding sources. Gallo describes NIH support as underlining the continuing programs of the institute, and Gates as having encouraged them to \"go for it.\" Gallo is the recipient of the most esteemed international scientific awards including being a two-time winner of pos-sibly the most important U.S. honor, the Lasker Prize. He tells a story of a meeting between his wife and Mary Lasker, during which Mrs. Lasker asked if there was anything she could do for Gallo. With humor, Mrs. Gallo suggested a third Lasker Prize, which earned a surprised reaction. No wonder, since Gallo is to date, one of only a few recipients of two Laskers. Success of scientific endeavors comes slowly. Does Gallo ever become impatient? \"When I was young, yes\" he admits. \"But not anymore. With time, you get realistic and settle down.\" The man who has accumulated most of international sci- ence's most prestigious honors, including induction into the National Academy of Science, hesitates only briefly before naming his most cherished personal rewards. \"I have enjoyed the scientific and intellectual friendship of so many people,\" he says. \"I've been especially grateful to see many of the young scientists I've worked with become highly successful themselves. As for the institute, my hope is that it will forever contribute to our school of medicine campus growth and quality. It will be important for us not only to survive, but to grow and become better and better.\" War Against Disease After 40 years as CEO, founder and director of the University of Maryland Center for Vaccine Development (CVD), Myron M. Levine, MD, DTPH, the Bessie and Simon Grollman Distinguished Professor of Medicine, is about to take on a new challenge as associate dean for global health, vaccinology and infectious diseases. \"It's a wonderful opportunity that offers flexibility to focus on an array of issues and projects of global impor - tance,\" he says. Levine's career has followed two paths, global health and vaccinology. In the 1960s and early 1970s, global health was generally considered tropical medicine, pursued by the military, the Public Health Service, missionary groups and a few U.S. schools of medicine. These were the only doors open to a young physician whose interest focused on work in underdeveloped countries, and Levine took advantage of becoming involved in many of their activities. His interest became focused on vaccines at a time when vaccinology did not exist as a discipline. However, he undertook a series of projects that helped to formalize it as one. Over the next several decades, under his leadership, the CVD DiscoveryProfiles in By 1996, his scien- tific achievements led to his being named by Science magazine as the most cited scien- tist in the world between 1980 and 1990.By Rita M. Rooney Medicine Bulletin Fall 2014 [20] [21] University of Maryland became an internationally recognized organization in vac- cine development, and the implementation and combat of communicable diseases in developing countries. Looking back on the last four decades, Levine recalls some of his achievements\u2014he shuns the word \"achievements,\" prefer - ring \"areas of pursuit.\" He cites his participation in the smallpox eradication program in Bangladesh. As a World Health Organization consultant in Pakistan in 1967, he had experienced an ear - lier smallpox epidemic. He says it was enormously gratifying to him on a personal level to witness the last Asian case of the disease in 1975. \"It was a poignant counterpart to my Pakistan experience,\" he says. Levine spent time in Chile as consultant to the ministry of health on the problem of endemic typhoid fever. He recalls it as a \"seminal event that led to three decades of collaboration on typhoid and other enteric infections.\" He designed and supervised four field trials of live oral TY21, a typhoid vaccine that treated 560,000 Chilean school children and led to licensure by the FDA. While serving as a consultant to the Rockefeller Foundation, Levine helped create the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GA VI), serving as co-chair of the task force for research and development of the organiza-tion that includes multiple UN agencies, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, numer - ous government and non-government entities, the vaccine industry, developing countries and bilateral donors. Today, GA VI has revolution-ized vaccine supply and implementation at the global level. In 2002, Levine reluctantly resigned his post at GA VI in order to focus full attention to the CVD. He acknowledges, however, that GA VI's recognition of the importance of research is his legacy to the alliance. The country of Mali is another among many to hold special meaning for the tireless Levine. One of the poorest and least developed countries in the world, it was one without some of the most basic medical needs when the CVD team began working there in the early '90s. Today, CVD-Mali is a joint venture of the CVD and the Malian Ministry of Health. It has earned a repu-tation for evaluating vaccine candidates in the African setting, and new vaccines such as routine infant immunizations. Since Mali remains one of the world's most underdeveloped countries, this program serves as a role model. Levine reports that, before the CVD's intervention, facilities in Mali hospitals were such that doctors had to treat blindly. \"In the government hospital, where severely ill children were admitted, there was no clinical microbiology laboratory to perform blood or cerebrospi-nal fluid cultures to identify potentially treatable bacterial agents causing invasive disease,\" he says. He received grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation to furbish and equip a clinical microbiology laboratory and trained staff in a Mali government hospital. Since then, surveillance on invasive bacterial infections provide evidence for introduc-tion of vaccines against common causes of bacterial disease. Levine has fostered the development of a series of basic vaccine projects and has trained vaccinology faculty and fellows while doing so. \"Some of our vaccines are doing well in clinical trials or are preparing to transition to pre-clinical trials now,\" he says. Among these he includes a live cholera vaccine co-developed with James Kaper, professor of microbiology and immunology, a parenteral conjugate vaccine to prevent invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis, a live oral vaccine to prevent typhoid and paratyphoid fever, and another to prevent non-typhoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis. Giving some thought to the transitions ahead in his new position, Levine says, \"One of my strengths is recognizing the need for change. \"I'd like to leave the field while I can still kick a goal.\" Researching and Treating Addictive Behavior Bankole Johnson, Dsc, MD, MPhil, nation-ally acclaimed neuroscientist and the Irving J. Taylor MD Professor and Chair of the Department of Psychiatry, heads the brain science research consortium unit (BSRCU). The recently appointed Johnson has devoted much of his career to determining how the brain processes signals that ultimately translate to a person's behavior. \"That quest has taken me from pharmacology to neurosci- ence to molecular genetics to brain imaging research\u2014and the search continues,\" says Johnson, whose specialization is the psychopharmacology of medications used to treat addictions. Johnson graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1982. He trained in psychiatry at the Royal London and Maudsley, and Bethlem Royal Hospitals, received a masters in philosophy degree in neuropsychiatry from the Univer - sity of London, and conducted doctoral research at Oxford University. He received an MD in biomedical sciences, then a doctor of science in medicine from the University of Glasgow. \"I wanted to understand how the brain actually pro- cesses the signals of someone using alcohol or drugs,\" he says. \"What systems in the brain make people continue to choose decisions which, at some level, they know are not good for them?\" \"The research can become complicated,\" Johnson says, \"because behavioral and biological factors vary for each person.\" Currently, his research has led to the study of molecular indications to identify those who can be effectively treated with the most specific treatment for their molecular differences. \"One thing we have learned without exception is that genetics are not destiny,\" he says. \"People make choices outside of their biology.\" Much of Johnson's research can be considered the frontier of neuroscience for addictive behavior, focusing on why people become addicted. \"We know a lot of basic science about addiction,\" he says. \"We know less about how we can apply that to treatment.\" The BSRCU at Maryland is an initiative that will bring together some of the most highly qualified neuroscience researchers at the university for the purpose of developing important cures in the treatment of brain disorders. The BSRCU is a bold response to Dean Reece's ACCEL-Med call to increase interdisciplinary research throughout the school. Johnson says the opportunities for collaboration are exceptional for the program. With a strong background in translational neuroscience, and degrees in both basic discovery/research and clinical science, Johnson is ideally situated to bridge the gap between the two disciplines. \"It's exciting to realize that Maryland is at the forefront of such an important research initiative,\" he says. \"Right now, this university is fortunate in having some of the top neuroscientists in the country. We will first be developing themes of research, and eventually we'll be working with other insti-tutions in specific collaborative areas.\" Among the disorders studied by consortium participants are psychiatric and mood swing disorders, brain inflamma-tion, brain trauma, traumatic brain injury, and the drugs that produce inflammatory influences in the brain. Johnson believes the medical school is fortunate to have proton technology on site for focused ultrasound and mag-netic technology of the brain. The collaborative program will be aimed, not only on understanding brain diseases, but on the brain itself. \"We're at a fascinating juncture in neuroscience, which involves not only treating disease but also enhancing the brain\" he says. Johnson continues to treat patients, believing it's impor - tant to do so because it is often the patient who provides the answers to problems. \"I think there is no point in acquiring all this knowl- edge, finding new medicines, and then not being able to use them,\" he says. \"One of the joys I get is being in the forefront of discovery and then being able to watch someone get well because of it.\" When the nationally regarded Johnson first received an invitation to apply for his position in the department of psy-chiatry, he put it aside until his wife brought it to his atten-tion, insisting it looked like a possibility he should explore. He followed her advice which led to very happy results. \"During the interview process, I became intrigued by all the fascinating and clever people here,\" he says. \"When I had my final interview with Dean Reece whom I found to be engaging and so focused on the importance of superior research, I knew I had to be here.\" Johnson and his wife, Carolina, have two sons, ages four and one. \"They are my life bonds,\" he says. \"They are everything.\" Speaking of his research and his reasons behind his studies of the brain, he explains, \"I guess we always want to reach for something we know we cannot fully grasp. We know a good deal about the brain, but there is much more that remains a mystery. We are millions of years away from a computer as smart as a rat's brain. That holds tremendous fascination for me.\" Under his leadership, the CVD became an internationally recognized organization in vaccine development, and the imple- mentation and combat of communicable diseases in developing countries. Much of Johnson's research can be considered the frontier of neuroscience for addictive behavior, focusing on why people become addicted.

Lennox Professor and Chair of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, and director of the division of epilepsy and clinical neurophysiology at Boston Children's Hospital, focused on neurology. \"Maryland had a superb neurology department under the leadership of Ken Johnson,\"Pearl says. \"The opportunity to study in such a wonderful environment was the deciding factor in choosing my specialty.\" Following medical school, Pearl took residencies in pediatrics and neurology at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, and a fellowship in clinical neurophysiology at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. He returned to the mid-Atlantic region and ultimately joined the neurology department at Children's National Medical Center, where he rose to division chief of neurology and professor of neurology, pediatrics and music at George Washington School of Medicine. He also developed research interest in inherited metabolic epilepsies with specific focus on GABA metabolism, a rare disorder encompassing epilepsy, intellectual deficiency, and autism spectrum disorder known as succinic semialde-hyde dehydrogenase deficiency. \"It all started with a single patient,\" he says. \"The boy was 16 and was having terrible seizures. His mother had taken him to several neurologists from Washington to Virginia, but his condition remained undiagnosed.\" Ultimately, Pearl made the diagnosis with colleagues in the laboratory at Children's National Hospital, which led to a research program with a bench scientist who developed an animal model of the disease, leading to clinical trials that Pearl has led over the past several years. The project led to special symposia and ultimately a book, Inherited Metabolic Epilepsies, that established this as a sub-specialty within pediatric epilepsy. This was the first of his three edited books and more than 110 manuscripts and 70 chapters in his specialty. Pearl reflects that his most natural inclination is toward teaching. \"I really loved teaching students and residents,\" he says. \"The interaction with young doctors and the opportunity to pass on what I have learned has been a joy.\" Funded consistently by the NIH and numerous foundations since 1992, Pearl has many honors and awards. During training, he received outstanding teaching awards from Baylor College of Medicine and Harvard Medical School, and in 2005, he received the distinguished teacher award for the outstanding clinical teacher at George Washington University School of Medicine. He has been an invited professor at multiple institutions and invited speaker at national and international conferences throughout the world. Currently, he is the president of the Professors of Child Neurology, the national organization of chairs and training program directors in pediatric neurology. T wo years ago, Pearl received a call from the head of the search committee at Boston Children's Hospital, where he had served a fellowship in clinical neurophysiol-ogy nearly 25 years before. The renowned hospital that founded the first seizure unit of its kind under the leader - ship of the internationally recognized William G. Lennox, MD, was seeking a professor and chair of neurology to replace their retiring chair. Asked if he had any sugges-tions of one who might fill that role, Pearl gave them several names. \"Well, we were hoping you might be interested in returning,\" the chair said. Pearl reports he had not been thinking of making a change. He and his wife had family and long established relationships in the Washington, DC, area. \"It was difficult to leave colleagues,\" he says. \"It was especially hard to leave hundreds of patients I was follow-ing. Some of them are traveling to Boston to consult me.\" Nevertheless, it was an opportunity for him to lead the division of epilepsy at Boston Children's, while continuing his research at the NIH. \"I'm finding that my new position is quite the mixture of administrator, clinician, researcher and educator,\" he says. \"I especially enjoy the opportunity to mentor junior faculty.\" Pearl was widowed at age 39 and had two children, now 27 and 25. He is now married to Maria Tartaglia Pearl, MD, and has two young daughters, in addition to one grandchild. Music and Pearl have been lifelong companions. He recalls fondly leading the follies band during his years at the medical school. He even taught in the music depart-ment at George Washington University. While at George Washington, he and a colleague formed the Drs. Phil Pearl/Jorge Rodriguez Children's Hospital Jazz Band. For eight consecutive years they entertained at the hospital's annual Jazzmatazz Festival benefitting medical care for indigent children at the hospital. Since arriving in Boston in January of this year, he was recruited into the percus-sion section of the Longwood Symphony Orchestra, an orchestra of physicians and others in the Longwood area, and already has performed in a concert at the famous Jordan Hall of the New England Conservatory of Music. In some of his international medical presentations, Pearl has lectured on the link between neurology disor - ders and famous musicians. He has presented of Beethoven's deafness, Schumann's madness, Ravel's dementia, Gershwin's uncinated seizures and others, all the while reviewing their neurological histories, and simultaneously performing their music at the piano. Pearl has a CD of his jazz band and is happy to send a copy to any alum who emails him at phillip.pearl@ childrens.harvard.edu. \"I'd be delighted to send a copy to anyone who wants one.\" He says, \"possibly with a request they make a contri-bution to the University of Maryland Medical School.\" [37] University of Maryland In some of his international medical presentations, P earl has lectured on the link between neurology disorders and famous musicians. ...all the while reviewing their neurological histories, and simultaneously performing their music at the piano.[ Al u m n u s Pr o f i l e ] Phillip L. Pearl, '84Scoring a High Note in Medicine Medicine Bulletin Fall 2014 [36] By Rita M. Rooney Medicine Bulletin Fall 2014 [38] [39] University of Maryland [ Al u m n u s Pr o f i l e ] An Exercise in LivingAcknowledging that he enjoyed the benefits of travel, learning a new language and making lifelong friends abroad, Ades talks of his enthusiasm in coming back to Maryland. \"I felt then that it was important for me to complete my clinical training in the U.S., and I was right,\" he says. \"They were terrific years, with great teachers. I remember believing it was such a privilege to be there. When I look back at what I've been able to do in my life, I know much of it wouldn't have been pos-sible had I not returned to Maryland.\" He adds that, being accepted at Maryland was so important to him that he kept his acceptance letter from then admissions chair, Dr. Gilbert Allen, for many years. Following a residency in internal medicine at McGill University, Montreal, Ades served a fellowship in cardiol-ogy at the University of Colorado where he focused on the impact of exercise in cardiac rehabilitation. He began his medical career as director of the cardiac rehabilitation program at the University of Vermont Medical School, where his research and clinical practice continue as professor of medicine, director of cardiac reha-bilitation and preventive cardiology. His training as well as his personal inclinations led him to establish a program emphasizing the value of exercise for cardiac patients of different ages and with various medical histories. While that may not seem extraordinary today, the concept of indi-vidualizing care based upon the patient profile was new to rehabilitative programs in the 1980s. \"At the time, it was also considered that a person past 65 should be excluded from cardiac rehabilitation because these patients were more disabled,\" Ades reports. As his subsequent research proved, he believed rehabilitation was especially important for these older patients for the very reason that they may be disabled. He says he was not the first to recognize this fact, but he was in the forefront of studies that ultimately led to its acceptance. His first NIH-funded program, published in the journal Circulation, included muscle studies demonstrating the considerable value of cardiac rehabilitation among older patients. His subsequent studies, also NIH-supported, have included those directed to the mechanisms of muscle wast-ing in aging men, resistance training for older women with coronary disability, a study defining effects of chronic disuse on skeletal muscle contraction in the elderly, another exploring high caloric expenditure exercise in cardiac rehabilitation for overweight patients, and one investigating relationships between personal behaviors and the risk for chronic disease and premature death. Ades' 2001 article in the New England Journal of Medicine examined the value of cardiac rehabilitation for the second-ary prevention of coronary heart disease, showing statistics for men and women, ages 50 to 69, and 70 to 88 years of age, with and without coronary heart disease. It concluded that deaths within five years of coronary heart disease incurred by patients can be lessened when cardiac rehabilitation is initiated. In 2008, Ades' book, The Eating Well, Healthy Heart Cookbook sold more than 30,000 copies nationally, and was nominated for the James Beard Award in the healthy heart category. This time, Ades' research provided a lay audience with the benefits of a healthy lifestyle by showing readers how they can cut risk of a heart attack by 50 percent by making healthy eating choices. Ades' prescription for exercise in cardiac rehabilitation is one he subscribes for a generally healthy lifestyle\u2014and one he and his wife, Deborah, thoroughly enjoy. The parents of three adult children, they engage in cycling, and frequently take biking trips throughout Vermont and Canada. Since they also like to travel, they have managed to combine the two in biking tours through Italy and Ireland, where they see the country landscapes up close. Ades has been included in Best Doctors in America since 2005. He has served as president of the American Associa-tion of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, and as editor of The Journal of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Prevention. Among several awards, he has received the clini-cal investigator award from the NIH Aging Institute, and was the proud recipient of the First Annual Michael Pollack Award for Excellence in Research in Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation. Philip Ades graduated from Maryland with membership in the Alpha Omega Alpha Society. \"I worked extremely hard,\" he recalls. \"I considered it such an honor to be at Maryland. I just ran with it. Like most of us, I've kept in touch with friends through the years, and it makes me proud to realize, that as good as the medical school was while I was a student, it has become so much better since then.\"hilip Ades' entry in the 1978 Terra Mariae Medicus reads, \"Phil trotted over from the Univer - sity of Brussels, and while at Maryland, found the time to run several marathons. He also was engaged in exercise research with Dr. Fisher.\" Reading those words years later, Ades can't help smiling. \"It's what I'm still doing,\" he says. As it turned out, the years Ades spent learning the basics of research from Michael Fisher, who was then chief of cardiology at the VA, became essential to his life's work as a nationally recognized cardiologist and researcher. \"I performed my first study, looking at exercise and echocardiogram results, in Michael Fisher's lab,\" Ades says. \"We tested members of a running club, and I learned a great deal that has made an impact on my career, both from Mike Fisher and Gary Plotnick, also a professor of cardiology.\" That career has been paralleled by continuous National Institutes of Health (NIH) sup- port, publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, and a best-selling healthy-heart cookbook. After graduating from the University of Maryland, College Park, Ades applied to the University of Maryland School of Medicine but didn't make the cut. He then went to the University of Brussels Medical School and, following four years of a seven-year program, returned to Baltimore into the third-year class. By Rita M. Rooney His training as well as his personal inclinations led him to establish a program emphasiz- ing the value of exercise for cardiac patients of different ages and with various medical histories.

Using a trust is one of several estate plan-ning strategies that may be viable as part of an overall master plan for wealth preservation and transfer. Generally speaking, a trust is a separate entity created to take ownership and control over property for the benefit of a third party. The person that creates the trust is referred to as the grantor, settlor or trustor. This individual usually decides what assets will be transferred to the trust, names the trustee(s) and beneficiary(s) of the trust, and determines the terms and conditions of the trust. The trustee manages the property for the beneficiary in accordance with the provisions and directions defined in the trust document. There can be one or multiple trustees of a trust, including an individual, such as a family mem-ber, or a corporate trustee, such as a bank trust department. Creating a trust requires the careful consideration of a variety of matters. A trust, commonly referred to as a deed or agreement, is a written instrument generally drafted by an attorney and signed by the settlor as well as the trustee(s). This document provides the terms of the trust, names the trustee and the beneficiary, directs the trustee regarding the management of the assets held by the trust, and instructs the trustee about when to disburse income and principal to the beneficiary. The trustee's duties may include numerous complex legal, investment and fiduciary decisions, so the selection of the trustee is an important step in the process. State law governs how a trust is created and maintained, and these laws vary from state to state, so the decision regarding where to create the trust should be discussed with an attorney. Since trusts can hold cash, stocks, bonds, insurance policies, real estate, artwork and a variety of other assets, the funding of the trust should reflect the financial goals and objectives of the grantor. There are many different types of trusts that are used to accommodate the goals, objectives and intentions of the creator. The different types of trusts that can be cre-ated are often described in terms of when the trusts are established and whether the trusts can be modified after implementation. For example, a living trust, which is also referred to as an inter vivos trust, is established during life. This form of trust can terminate or can continue after an individual's death and is often used to avoid probate, as Ethe property in the trust is distributed according to the terms of the trust, not a Will. These trusts are also described as being revocable since this type of trust can be amended or completely dissolved. Alternatively, a testamen-tary trust is created by Will, and it does not come into existence until one's death, at which time the trust becomes irrevocable. The assets associated with a testamentary trust are transferred under the terms of one's Will and pass through probate. The terms of the resulting irrevocable trust cannot be amended or revoked once the trust has been established. Trusts are often used to avoid probate, facilitate the professional management of investments and other assets, provide for minor children, manage potential estate tax liability, and protect assets from creditors. If you believe that the use of a trust may be appropriate to address your wealth preservation and transfer aspirations, you would be well served by seeking guidance from a qualified attorney and from a qualified wealth planning professional.

Davis, class of 1821, was elected to the U.S. Congress from Carlisle, Indiana. He served three additional terms and during the 29th Congress was appointed Speaker of the House. He later enjoyed presidential appointments as commissioner to China and governor of the Oregon Territory .In 1889, The Maryland Training School for nurses opened at the school's infirmary under the direction of Louisa Parsons, an 1860 graduate of Miss Nightingale's Nursing School and Home. It was established as a solution to a shortage of hospital labor and consisted of a two-year apprenticeship. The name was later changed to the University of Maryland School of Nursing.
