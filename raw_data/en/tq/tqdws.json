The editors have selected and organized this compilation of forms, checklists, policies, and guidelines to create a convenient resource for IPs. These resources are not intended to be all inclusive \u2014instead, they provide a variety of samples to aid IPs in creating, improving, and enhancing their infection prevention and control programs. This first volume of resources is presented in six sections: Infection Prevention Programs, Infection Prevention Education, S urveillance, Precautions, Performance Improvement, and Environment of Care. Each section provides sample forms, policies, guidelines, and links to additional resources and background reading. The samples may be modified to meet an individual facility's needs for their particular demographic population. Please note that every effort has been made to verify the internet links provided as resources; however, at times the location of information may change. Infection prevention has its origins dating back to the first half of the 18th century and has been evolving since that time. The pioneers of infection prevention have been sharing their research, accomplishments, and lessons learned in an effort to foster the common goal of improved care for our patients, staff, and visitors while reducing and preventing infection. The resources in this book can help IPs to create structured infection prevention programs, and to develop education, systematic surveillance measures, and ongoing data analysis that allow for patient improvement opportunities. Research, education, and communication foster collaboration for improved patient outcomes. The infection preventionists who shared their time, resources, and expertise hope that you will find this book useful, and that it will spark the continued motivation to communicate and share your research, accomplishments, and lessons learned as stewards of reducing and preventing infection.

The editors have selected and organized this compilation of forms, checklists, policies, and guidelines to create a convenient resource for IPs. These resources are not intended to be all inclusive\u2014instead, they provide a variety of samples to aid IPs in creating, improving, and enhancing their infection prevention and control programs. This second volume of resources is presented in five sections: Patient Care Policies, Department Policies, Occupational Health, Construction and Renovation, and Long-Term Care. Each section provides sample forms, policies, guidelines, and links to additional resources and background reading in Section Resources pages. The samples may be modified to meet an individual facility's needs for their particular demographic population. Please note that every effort has been made to verify the internet links provided as resources; however, at times the location of information may change. Infection prevention is the discipline responsible for prevention of healthcare-associated infections, dating back to the first half of the 18th century. Each passing century has given birth to new and formidable pathogen adversaries against which infection prevention continues its fight. IPs work against the spread of disease through education, prevention, and control of transmission in the healthcare environment. The resources in this book can help IPs to create structured infection prevention programs, develop staff, patient, and visitor awareness, and promote a safe healthcare environment for patients, visitors, and staff members. These resources can also raise awareness of expanded infection prevention opportunities with collaboration between hospitals and long-term care settings to promote our vigilant efforts to prevent, reduce, and protect against both existing and emerging pathogens. It is only through continued teamwork, collaboration, research, and education that we can be successful stewards. The IPs who shared their time, resources, and expertise hope that you will find this book useful, and that it will spark the continued motivation to communicate and share your research, accomplishments, and lessons learned as we face the future of existing and emerging infectious diseases and the continued challenges to protect our patients through prevention and control.

Cleaning and Disinfecting Patient Care Equipment Purpose To minimize the risk of transmitting infections, between patients or employees, via contact with equipment that may be contaminated. Policy Non-critical patient care equipment (touch intact skin) must receive low-level disinfection with a hospital grade disinfectant before use on each patient. Surfaces must be pre-cleaned when visibly soiled before being disinfected. Low level disinfection is performed following the manufacturer's instruction for use (IFU) using either bleach germicidal disposable wipes (4 minute wet time), the Super Sani-Cloth germicidal disposable wipe (2 minute wet time) or a hospital grade disinfection product such as Q256 (10 minute wet time). Procedure The following grid outlines the procedure to be utilized for cleaning some of the most commonly used patient care equipment: Shared Equipment All In-patient Care Units Equipment User Timing Product Other Automated Vital Sign machineNursingBefore use on each patient Sani-cloth BP cuffs/machines NursingBefore use on each patient EVSDaily discharge room cleaningSani-cloth Commode EVSDaily & discharge room cleaningBleach wipes Glucose monitors NursingBefore use on each patientSani-cloth IV poles* EVS/SPDDaily & discharge room cleaningSani-cloth Bedside tables/trays Nursing/EVSDaily & discharge room cleaningSani-cloth Patient lift equipment NursingBefore use on each patientSani-clothPOLICY & PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Infection PreventionDATE ISSUED: Jun 2016 SUPERSEDES: 2016 DEPARTMENT: Infection Prevention POLICY NO: 5076-517 REVIEWED BY: Infection Control Committee DATE REVIEWED: 6/16 Forms & Checklists for Infection Prevention, Volume 28 Equipment User Timing Product Other Thermometers NursingBefore use on each patientSani-cloth Exergen: Temporal ScannerNursingBefore use on each patientAlcohol wipes Manufacturer IFU Walkers Nursing/PT/OTBefore use on each patientSani-cloth Obtain from Rehab Wheelchairs Nursing/PT/OT TransporterBefore use on each patientSani-cloth Bladder Scanner Nursing/MD/PABefore use on each patientSani-cloth Glucose monitors NursingBefore use on each patientSani-cloth Accu-Vein Machine use on each patientSani-cloth TechDaily & discharge room cleaningSani-clothRehab Tech pump NursingBefore use on each patientSani-cloth EKG NursingBefore on use each each patientSani-cloth use each patientSani-cloth Medication carts*** Nursing/Pharmacy When visibly soiled Sani-cloth Medication refrigerator Nursing Weekly Sani-cloth Seizure pads NursingBefore use on each patientSani-cloth PADS seizure NursingBefore use on each patientSani-cloth ICUs & Step-Down Units Equipment User Timing Product Other Balloon pump NursingBefore use on each patientSani-cloth Doppler machines Nursing/MD/PABefore use on each patientSani-cloth Portable Telemetry transmitterNursingBefore use on each patientSani-cloth Portable transport use on each patientSani-cloth Cardiology machines (TCP, Art Seg)NursingDaily & discharge room cleaningSani-cloth9 Forms & Checklists for Infection Prevention, Volume 2 Pediatric & OB Equipment User Timing Product Other Apnea monitor Sani-cloth Bili light Sani-cloth Circumcision board NursingBefore use on each patientSani-cloth Fetal monitor NursingBefore use on each patientSani-cloth Infant warmerDaily & discharge room cleaningSani-cloth Isolettes/incubator NursingDaily & discharge room cleaningSani-cloth Scale NursingBefore use on each patientSani-cloth Use bleach wipes for patients on Contact Isolation for C. difficile.

Discharge Room Cleaning All reusable patient care equipment in the room when the patient is discharged will be cleaned by the EVS using a hospital grade disinfectant solution following the manufacturer's IFU. Items to be cleaned and disinfected include but are not limited to the bed, bedside table and stand, chairs and recliners, IV poles, SCD, and commode. After cleaning some items maybe be bagged and placed in a clean storage area. IV Pumps and Feeding Pumps SPD staff will round three times per day to collect used pumps. In high volume areas, SPD staff will clean the pumps using a hospital grade disinfectant, bag and place the clean pumps into the clean storage area. In low volume areas, the used pumps are collected and are brought to SPD where they are placed into the decontamination room for cleaning. They are manually hand cleaned using a disinfectant. Once the item is cleaned, a clear plastic bag is placed over the equipment, and it is stored for retrieval to any unit that may request them. IV Poles Used IV poles not currently needed for patient care will be placed in the dirty utility room. SPD staff will round three times per day to collect used IV poles which are taken to SPD and cleaned. Clean IV poles are bagged and stored for retrieval to any unit that may request them.
