Introduction The relationship between our physical and emotional state can be the reason why things fall out of balance within our bodies. Allergies are a really good example of this. Let me explain. Sometimes, when our bodies begin to present with problems physically, this can mean that there is a problem emotionally too. The relationship between our physical body, energetic body, and spiritual body, is complex and one that must be cared for when things begin to go wrong for us medically. Along with medical treatment, it is important to understand how our mental and spiritual health may have affected us physically too. By understanding this and treating our WHOLE selves, not just the physical presentations, we immediately ensure that a treatment plan is as effective as possible. Allergies are a sure sign that something is going on that is not just physical, but spiritual too. How does our mind affect our body? There is a growing understanding scientifically that our emotional well-being has a huge impact on our physical well-being. When conditions or diseases start to present in our physical body, it is well documented that our energetic minds have something to do with it. Current studies show that we have a 60% increased risk of autoimmune disorders if we have experienced mental or emotional trauma. This includes things like allergies. When we are stressed or have some sort of mental pain, our brain starts to produce chemicals that signal to the immune system that there is a physical problem that needs to be stopped. So, the immune system reacts by sending out increased immune responses, that would normally attack the infection, tumor, etc., and neutralize it. But what happens when this is an emotional problem? These immune responses are still produced, but with nothing to attack, they search and search for something to shoot at. Eventually, the immune system starts to look at normal and healthy tissue and thinks, well, this must be the problem and attacks parts of our own healthy body. This is autoimmunity. The same thing happens with allergies, and the immune system flags normal things that we put into our bodies as dangerous and starts to attack them every time we encounter them. This is how allergies start out of the blue. Reasons why allergies may have an emotional and spiritual meaning: You are searching. Conditions or diseases tend to present in reflection of what is bothering us spiritually. Allergies are the response of the immune system to searching for something that isn't there and flagging it as dangerous. Are you searching for something that you cannot find? A healthy relationship, your spiritual awakening, a life that you know you want deep down inside. Whatever the thing is that you are searching for, it doesn't really matter about the subject. The problem is the same. Take some time to really think about what it is that you are searching for and what is stopping you from getting it. Once you have identified this, you are halfway there, and you can then begin to put plans in place to start doing what it is that you need to do.

Again, a reflection of this condition would be that you are frightened of something unseen and do not know what to do with yourself, so you are just going about your life in the best way that you can see. This is completely okay, and most people would say that they are doing this, also. We are all just trying to cope with what we have and make the best of it. This is ok, but what if you could make it better? What is it that you are frightened of? Some common examples are: - Your own power - Taking a leap of faith - Achievement - achieving them or not achieving them - Not living your dream All of these reasons come down to the same thing... fear. Address the reason for your fear, and you will be well on your way to working up the courage to go out there and be the best you can be.

It's easy to say that anger is the root cause of a lot of things. But is it the cause of your allergies? When we are angry, we produce cortisol and adrenaline. These are the chemicals that cause the immune system to go into overdrive if they are present in our system long enough. So, is anger causing your allergies? If you think this might be you, then your body is trying to tell you that it really is time to let go. I know this is easy to say, and maybe someone did something to you that is totally unforgivable. But it really is true when they say that anger is only hurting you. It isn't affecting the person who hurt you. And now it could be manifesting in your allergies and truly causing you harm. The best thing that we can do is work to release that energy now. Meditation is a great way to get in touch with this emotion, look at why you are still holding it, and over time you may feel comfortable enough to release it. It is clear that allergies can be a manifestation of emotional turmoil. And when we leave these things unaddressed, they can become dangerous, to the point of making us very ill. Take the time to sit with yourself with a truthful and loving eye. Try to understand what it is that could be causing these issues for you. It is important to recognize that these feelings may once have protected you from something and be grateful to yourself for that. But it is now time to understand this and let go of anything that no longer serves you. This can be a difficult and emotional process, but once you have done the work and released any energy that is no longer meant for you, then your body will be able to relax and begin repairing itself.
