Below are the discipline course descriptions, learning objectives, student expectations and learning outcomes. EM Discipline Description: The Emergency Department creates an unique opportunity for medical students to acquire a foundation of knowledge and skills to care for patients with emergency medical conditions. We believe that every physician should possess adequate assessment and management skills to rapidly identify life-threatening conditions, to initiate care, demonstrate procedural proficiency and to know whom and when to call for assistance, regardless of their ultimate medical specialty and training. The Emergency Department is also one of the few practice sites where students play an integral role in the initial evaluation of an undifferentiated patient - where the diagnosis is completely unknown on initial contact. The medical students are expected to be an involved, engaged and active member of the ED team, providing ED patient care and communicating with families. Anesthesia Discipline Description: The medical student rotation in the Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative Medicine and Pain Management is designed to provide medical students with insights into the specialty of general anesthesiology, its subspecialties and the importance of the anesthesiologist in caring for patients prior to surgery, during surgery and the postoperative period. We will educate medical students on the multi-faceted role anesthesiologists play as perioperative physicians, intensivists and pain medicine specialists and how anesthesiologists apply their diagnostic skills and problem-solving abilities in these arenas will be demonstrated. At the same time, we will teach students to perform technical procedures appropriate to their level of training. Whenever feasible, we will promote participation in research so that students may explore a topic in depth as well as develop skills in critical thinking. During the Anesthesia rotation, students will become familiar with the many facets of the practice of anesthesiology including the perioperative setting, pre-anesthetic evaluation, induction and maintenance of anesthesia during surgery, patient emergence from anesthesia and post anesthesia care. It is expected that the medical student will develop an information base allowing them to identify and manage common preoperative concerns. We aim to develop recognition of the importance of patient safety; understand pharmacological dosing, complications related to various anesthetic techniques; understand basic ACLS and understand the management of regional anesthetics. The clerkship offers a unique opportunity for medical students to gain valuable experience and knowledge of the operating room setting within an academic institution. You will be exposed to the daily challenges faced by anesthesiologists. Surgery Discipline Description: The main purpose of the Surgery rotation is to provide the medical student with the resources and knowledge to recognize surgical disease. Career choices available to the medical student today in terms of medical discipline and specialty are quite varied. However, surgical disease is something that needs to be recognized and identified by all physicians. Every clinician needs to understand when patients have surgical problems and need to be referred to a surgeon. Doctors also need to understand proper screening tools available to prevent surgical problems and the appropriate times to order these studies. The purpose of the Surgery rotation is not to produce a junior surgeon. The main goal of this clinical rotation is to introduce the junior student to the world of general surgery and to show students that surgeons play an important role in the management of patients amongst all disciplines in medicine. In addition, students will see that surgery is an exciting field especially with all of the technological advances of the 21st century. The Surgery rotation will introduce students to a wide spectrum of surgical diseases. By following patients through their initial presentation to the operating room, their perioperative and post-operative care, students will be able to observe the evolution and resolution of surgical disease processes. Teaching in the operating room and at the bedside, in particular, brings students and patients together for their mutual benefit. Components: LEC. Grading: GRD. Typically Offered: Fall & Spring.

The 200-level MAP courses continue what you started to learn in Phase 1: the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are essential to practicing clinical medicine and to becoming transformative leaders in education, research, and policy/health systems. MAP 200s sessions will exclusively occur in your Learning Community on the same House afternoon as during Phase 1. You will meet with your peers and your Longitudinal Clinical Educator (LCE) for two hours once every six weeks using the same flipped classroom approach as in Phase 1. To make the most of these session, you must pay careful attention to pre-session independent work to complete individually or as part of a team each week. To ensure that you have time to prepare for MAP sessions, your clerkship directors know that you have the entire afternoon on your MAP days (1-5pm), even though you are not required to meet with the group until 3pm. The MAP 200 courses are pass/fail, and there are no exams or graded work. To pass the course, you must attend every MAP session; you must come prepared and actively participate. We believe that you will enjoy the chance to step back from the clerkship and regather with your learning community to discuss and understand your clinical experiences. Components: MOD. Grading: GRD.
