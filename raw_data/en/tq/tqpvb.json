Why immunize our children? S ometimes we are confused by the messages in the media. First we are assured that, thanks to vaccines, some diseases are almost gone from the U.S. But we are also warned to immunize our children, ourselves as adults, and the elderly. Diseases are becoming rare due to vaccinations. Some diseases are becoming very rare in the U.S., they are becoming rare largely because we have been vaccinating against them. It is OK to ask whether it's really worth it to keep vaccinating. It's much like bailing out a boat with a slow leak. When we started bailing, the boat was filled with water. But we have been bailing fast and hard, and now it is almost dry. We could say, \"Good. The boat is dry now, so we can throw away the bucket and relax.\" But the leak hasn't stopped. Before long we'd notice a little water seeping in, and soon it might be back up to the same level as when we started. Keep Immunizing until disease is eliminated. Unless we can \"stop the leak\" (eliminate the disease), it is important to keep immunizing. Even if there are only a few cases of disease today, if w e take away the protection given by vaccination, more and more people will become infected and will spread disease to others. Soon we will undo the progress we have made over the years. What if we stopped vaccinating? Diseases that are almost unknown would stage a comeback. Before long we would see epidemics of diseases Next Downeast Public Council Friday, November 20, 2020 9:00 - 11:00 AM Virtual Meeting: A Distance Option will be available.

We vaccinate to protect our future . We don't vaccinate just to protect our children. We also vaccinate t o protect our grandchildren and their grandchildren. With one disease, smallpox, we \"stopped the leak\" in the boat by eradicating the disease. Our children don't have to get smallpox shots anymore because the disease no longer exists. Smallpox is now only a memory, and if we keep vaccinating against other diseases, the same will someday be true for them too. Vaccinations are one of the best ways to put an end to the serious effects of certain disease. For more information please see click the Maine CDC Vaccines and Immunizations Page. Maternal Vaccination You have the power to protect yourself and your baby each pregnancy from serious diseases like whooping cough and flu. If you are pregnant, getting vaccinated can help protect your baby after birth by passing on antibodies. These antibodies can give your baby short -term protection from flu and whooping cough until it is time for their own vaccines. Ask your doctor or nurse about the vaccines you need during pregnancy to protect yourself and your baby. Childhood/Adolescent Vaccinati on You have the power to protect your children against serious diseases like measles, cancers caused by HPV, and whooping cough. Preteens and teens need four vaccines to protect against serious diseases: meningococcal conjugate vaccine to protect against m eningitis and bloodstream infections; HPV vaccine to protect against cancers caused by HPV; Tdap vaccine to protect against tetanus, diphtheria and Is your child behind on their immunizations? For more information or to schedule an appointment, contact Public Health Nursing: Call 207 -287- 4112 Herd Immunity When a contagious disease enters an vaccinated group, many members are infected because they lack immunity against the disease. An important element of this is determined by the maturity and strength of an individuals' immune system. For example, very young children and elderly and frail adults might be more susceptible to infections because of immune system defects. When a large percentage of the population is vaccinated, the spread of disease is limited. This indirectly protects unimmunized individuals, including those who can't be vaccinated and those for whom vaccination was not successful. This is the principle of herd immunity. In disease spread from person to person, it is more difficult to maintain a chain of infection when much of the population is vaccinated. As the number of those vaccinated increases, the protective effect of herd immunity increases. For some diseases, herd immunity may begin to be induced with as little as 40% of the population vaccinated. More commonly, and depending on the contagiousness for whooping cough; and a yearly flu vaccine to protect against seasonal flu. View CDC's parent -friendly immunization schedule to see which vaccines your children need, whether they are babies or teenagers. Adult Vaccination You have the power to protect yourself against serious diseases like shingles, pneumonia, and flu. Vaccines aren't just for kids. Adults may need vaccines to protect against whooping cough, flu, pneumonia, and shingles. Ask your doctor about vaccines you may need for your age, health conditions, job, or lifestyle. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/events/niam/ parents/key -messages.html Aroostook Mental Health Services, Inc. (AMHC), is please to announce its selection by the state of Maine to pilot an information and referral line in Washington County for those challenged by substance use disorder. The pilot project is for six months and staff will connect callers with referral services to counseling, peer services, recovery coaching, and/or other related assistance. The project is intended to coordinate services needs that help bridge any gaps in services needed to support treatment and recovery services for those with substance use disorder. The phone line is now live and can be reached at 1- 833-687-4887 (833 -NVR -GVUP) or (207) 454 -1999. the diseas e, vaccination rates may need to be as high as 80% - 95%. This percentage is called the herd immunity threshold. When only a small percentage of the population is vaccinated, the risk of disease outbreak is greater than if many are vaccinated. The unvacin nated member of the population are not indirectly protected, and each community member has a higher risk of becoming infected. https://www.historyofvaccines.org/cont ent/herd -immunity -0 A Local Public Health Systems Assessment is currently being planned for 2020 but has been postponed.
