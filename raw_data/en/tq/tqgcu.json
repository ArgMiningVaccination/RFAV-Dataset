And on and on. To some extent, all of these factors may be influencing the situation. But the experts missed one of the most important factors: post-viral fatigue. Simply put, many people have experienced\u2014and continue to experience-profound multi-system fatigue following infection with SARS-CoV-2. As is the case with other viral pathogens, this one can render people profoundly debilitated and, in many cases, unable to return to work. A Widespread Problem I believe the Great Resignation isn't happening because people are lazy; it is happening in large part because many people are burdened with chronic illness. Countless infections can trigger persistent chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia (CFS/FMS). For example, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Herpes simplex (HSV-1), Lyme disease, and even polio have been implicated. We can now add SARS-CoV-2 to this list. Between 10 to 15% of people who've had Covid-19 develop persistent exhaustion, as part of the syndrome we're now calling Long Covid. Unfortunately, our healthcare system seems to be treating Long Covid in the same way it has always treated CFS/FMS. Essentially, it is \"gaslighting\" people, telling them they are depressed or lazy. Historically, physicians have done this for complex, poorly understood, and time-intensive conditions, especially when they affect women and when they're not easily diagnosed or quickly treated with profitable drugs or procedures. Some examples? Multiple sclerosis used to be called \"hysterical paralysis.\" When I was in medical school, Lupus was still considered a neurosis. With CFS/FMS, patients often go for years without the correct diagnosis or thorough treatment. Too often, their doctors abusively insinuate that, \"since I don't know what's wrong with you, you must be crazy.\" This is now occurring with Long Covid as well. Long Covid carries considerable social stigma. A recent UK study of nearly 900 such patients showed that 95% experienced stigma at least sometimes, and 76% experienced it often. Practitioners may unintentionally contribute to the problem by failing to recognize that CFS/FM is rooted in actual post-viral pathophysiology, leading patients to believe their fatigue is a character flaw. Exhaustion & Insomnia Part of the challenge in treating post-Covid fatigue is that it is seldom an \"all or nothing\" condition, where people are either totally disabled or \"just fine.\" Many are \"walking wounded\", so to speak. They're marginally functional, but far from their pre-Covid energy levels. Despite the fatigue, many have difficulty sleeping. A Cleveland Clinic study just published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine shows that 40% of a cohort of 962 patients with Long Covid have moderate to severe sleep problems. The paradox of chronic exhaustion with insomnia is a typical feature of post-viral FM/CFS. The insomnia, along with brain fog, chronic pain, and weight gain, indicate hypothalamic dysfunction. When someone is overloaded by viral infections, other types of infections, or extreme stress, the hypothalamus basically shuts down and the body loses one of it's key 'circuit-breakers'. This key control center in the brain regulates sleep, along with hormonal and autonomic function. But it's a tricky situation because in the first year after a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients may experience hypersomnolence, which later gives way to insomnia. I've created a simple 10-minute free quiz to help people make a CFS/FMS diagnosis. There's also an easy-to-use one-page checklist for determining if someone meets the American College of Rheumatology's 2016 diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia. Though these tools are for CFS and FM in general, and not specific to Long Covid, they can be helpful in the post-Covid context. The acronym stands for: Sleep, Hormones (and Hypotension), Infections, Nutrition, and Exercise. By addressing these five domains, we can greatly improve the health of people with post-viral CFS. SHINE includes supplements, botanicals, hormonal therapies and in some cases, antivirals, antifungals, antidepressants, and drugs for sleep. Exercise also plays a role. The basic protocol includes a multivitamin, magnesium plus malic acid, melatonin, and a Valerian/Melissa combination. But there are many additional options depending on an individual's test results and clinical history. I've written a number of articles on applying the SHINE protocol at the patient care level. If you're interested in learning how, email me at FatigueDoc@gmail.com Ginseng Revival One herb that I've found to be particularly helpful for CFS/FM is Panax ginseng. For centuries, Ginseng has been one of most popular herbal medicines in Asia, and for good reason: it can be dramatically effective for numerous conditions. The problem is that for wild ginseng, it takes at least 17 years for a plant to mature and to develop high levels of active ginsenosides in response to harsh weather, threats from insects, and other challenges. And since it is the root portion that we use therapeutically, harvesting usually means ending the life of the plant. Decades ago, over-harvesting of wild ginseng led to insane prices (over $700 a pound), encouraged adulterations and substitutions, and essentially drove the plant to the brink of extinction. In response, farmers began cultivating ginseng, but I found that products derived from farmed ginseng just weren't as effective as those from wild plants. Because of this, I stopped using ginseng in my practice over 30 years ago. Recently, cultivators developed a unique and ingenious aquaponic farming technique which reproduces the challenges the plants face in the wild. It results in a form of farmed ginseng, called HRG80TM Red Ginseng, that has the same active phytochemical profile as mature wild plants. Initially skeptical when I first tried it, I was shocked at how effective it was. Enough so, that I decided to do an open-label study using the product with 188 patients with severe post-viral CFS. Prior to treatment, all patients reported that they were functioning at 50% or less of their pre-illness energy levels. They supplemented with 200-400 mg of the HRG80 in capsule form, or 100-200 mg in tablet form, daily for one month. The results speak for themselves: 60% rated themselves as \"improved,\" with 13% rating themselves \"much better\" (p<.001) 67% average increase in energy 44% average increase in overall well-being 48% average improvement in mental clarity 46% average improvement in sleep 33% average decrease in pain 72% average increase in stamina The bottom line is, this unique form of aquaponically-grown red ginseng resulted in marked improvements in people with disabling fatigue, including post-viral fatigue. Of the two delivery forms (capsule or tablet), I prefer the chewable tablets. They contain natural gamma cyclodextrin, which increases absorption almost eightfold. That means, one half to one tablet can be as effective as four capsules. Important Considerations Botanicals like ginseng, and other supplements, can be a big help in recovering from post-viral CFS/FM. But there are many other important things to consider: Consider adrenal fatigue if the person gets irritable when hungry (\"Hangry\"). Give thyroid & reproductive hormone support if symptoms suggest they are needed. Address orthostatic intolerance (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)): This is common. Here's a quick POTS screening method you can do in the office or even have patients do at home. Ask the patient to lie supine quietly for 10 minutes, then check the pulse and blood pressure. Then, ask the patient to stand up and check the pulse and BP again, every two minutes, for 10 minutes. If the pulse goes up by 15 BPM any time during the 10-minute standing period, it is suggestive of orthostatic intolerance. If it goes up 30 BPM or more, it confirms the diagnosis. A drop of more than 10 points in systolic BP is also suggestive. Covid-related CFS/FMS is more likely in people who felt they needed to push through the acute infection phase, instead of resting. It's so important to let patients know that rest is critical when fighting off a viral pathogen\u2014or any bug, for that matter. Metformin may also have a role in preventing Long Covid. According to a large phase 3 treatment trial of 663 overweight people in TheLancet earlier this year, metformin reduced incidence of long Covid by half, if the drug was given within the first four days of acute symptoms. When starting patients on metformin, I begin with 500 mg on the first day, to make sure that nausea or diarrhea are not severe, and then increase the dose to 500 mg twice a day for 4 days. From there, I increase to 500 mg each morning and 1000 mg at bedtime for a total of two weeks. Metformin is especially important for people who already have CFS/FMS, to decrease the risk of a flare.

Supplementation with olive leaf extract, at 250 mg or 500 mg twice daily for five days, in addition to conventional care, significantly reduced body temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and c-reactive protein levels in a placebo-controlled study of 150 patients hospitalized with acute Covid-19. Compared with the placebo, the olive leaf extract also increased oxygen saturation, and reduced length of hospital stays by as much as two days, on average. \"Olive tree products had traditionally been used in the Mediterranean region for medicinal purposes. Olive leaves are a rich source of phenolic compounds, for instance, oleuropein, verbascoside, and hydroxytyrosol. These compounds have anti-inflammatory, antiviral activities,\" wrote lead author Elham Ahmadpour, a researcher at the Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran. Multiple Mechanisms Previous research has shown that compounds within olive leaf extracts can mitigate SARS-related cytokine storms by binding to cytokine receptors (Thangavel N, et al. Front Mol Biosci. 2021). There are also studies suggesting that olive leaf extracts can stimulate phagocytosis of viruses, and potentially block viral attachment to and penetration of host target cells (Moslegh G, et al. Trends Pharm Sci. 2016). One study, involving 32 high school athletes showed that oleorupein\u2014one of the most plentiful polyphenols in olive leaves\u2014could reduce sick days due to upper respiratory illness by as much as 28% (Somerville V, et al. Nutrients, 2019). Compounds within olive leaf extracts can mitigate SARS-related cytokine storms by binding to cytokine receptors. There are also studies suggesting that olive leaf extracts can stimulate phagocytosis of viruses, and potentially block viral attachment to and penetration of host target cells. For their study\u2014the first to assess the effects of olive leaf supplementation in a cohort of Covid patients\u2014Dr. Ahmadpour and her colleagues randomized 150 patients, aged 18 to 72 years, to treatment with a placebo, or olive leaf extract capsules containing 30% oleuropein, at doses of either 250 mg or 500 mg. All treatments were given every 12 hours for 5 days. The supplements (or placebo) were an adjunct to conventional treatments for Covid-19, which included: dexamethasone (8 mg daily for five days), remdesivir (200 mg on the first day, 100 mg for the next four days), heparin 5000 IU every 8 hours), and supplemental oxygen (6-8 L/minute). A total of 141 patients completed the study. Strong Clinical Impact By the fifth day of hospitalization, the patients in the 250 mg olive leaf group showed statistically significant reductions in body temperature (mean difference 0.34 \u00b0C), pulse rate (mean difference 5.42 BPM), and respiratory rate (mean difference 1.66 breaths per min) compared to those taking the placebo. Oxygen saturation was significantly higher, by roughly two percentage points, in the low-dose olive extract group than the control group. In both olive leaf groups the mean length of hospital stay was 6 days, versus a mean of 8 days in the placebo group. Those taking the 500 mg olive leaf extract supplements showed very similar patterns, and there were no major differences in the effects obtained with the two dose levels. At both dose levels, the olive leaf extract gave significant reductions in erythrocyte sedimentation rates (mean differences of 13.55 and 14.79 mm/h, for the low and high doses respectively) and c-reactive protein levels (mean differences of 15.68 and 16.28 mg/L, respectively). Notably, in both olive leaf groups the mean length of hospital stay was 6 days, versus a mean of 8 days in the placebo group. There were no adverse events associated with the olive leaf extract at either dose level. Ahmadpour and colleagues acknowledge that their study has some limitations, notably the fact that it excluded patients who required intensive care, and those who had histories of underlying chronic conditions. While their results may not be entirely generalizable to all patients with acute Covid, the data do suggest that olive leaf extract could be a valuable adjunctive treatment in the context of Covid care. Long-haul Covid has unique features, but essentially, it is a variant of post-viral syndrome. That's good news because many of the features of post-viral syndrome are easily treated. Between 20% and 25% of all Covid patients have persistent symptoms of some sort. Those numbers are similar to what we see with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and mononucleosis; roughly 25% of college students who get mono develop chronic fatigue. There are similar patterns with other infections, such as Avian flu. This is just what you see after certain kinds of viruses. Post-Covid symptoms are diverse. For some it's persistent loss of smell, or chronic fatigue and muscle pain. For others its brain fog and cognitive impairment, or chronic respiratory problems. But the \"official\" definition of long-haul is simply any symptom after the acute phase. Everything gets lumped together. That's absurd, because the patterns are not the same. I have been researching post-viral syndromes and working with patients affected by them for the last 45 years. My interest emerged from personal experience: I had post-viral complications back in 1975. The resulting chronic fatigue sidelined me for almost a year during med school. Between 20% and 25% of all Covid patients have persistent symptoms of some sort. Those numbers are similar to what we see with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and mononucleosis. Over the years, I developed a comprehensive approach I call the SHINE Protocol. The acronym stands for: Sleep, Hormones, Infections, Nutrition, and Exercise. By addressing these five domains, we can greatly improve the health of people with post-viral CFS. Much of what we've learned from CFS is applicable to post-Covid patients. SHINE includes supplements, botanicals, hormonal therapies and in some cases, antivirals, antifungals, antidepressants, and drugs for sleep. The basic protocol includes a multivitamin, magnesium plus malic acid, melatonin, and a Valerian/Melissa combination. But there are many additional options depending on an individual's test results and clinical history. When a patient comes in saying, \"I still feel lousy,\" months after Covid, the first step is to characterize the symptom patterns. They typically fall into one of the following patterns: Fatigue, brain fog, achiness, poor non-restorative sleep: This is the majority of long Covid patients. They experience extreme fatigue, yet they don't sleep well. Energy is low; thinking and memory are foggy. Some have muscle pain. This is classic post-viral CFS. The basic SHINE protocol works well here. For post-viral CFS, 91% of people will improve if they follow it closely. Pneumonia, respiratory distress, \"shock lung\": Some patients have long-term respiratory symptoms, especially if they had severe lung involvement during the acute phase. Again, this is not unique to Covid. Other viruses can also trigger shock lung. It usually improves on its own over time, but it can cause a lot of distress. For these patients, I recommend a highly-absorbed form of curcumin, and a reduced glutathione to turn off the inflammation and the oxidative stress. And also, low-dose naltrexone to turn off the microglial activation. Some people experience difficulty breathing in the absence of actual lung damage. A pulse oximeter-available for about $25 on Amazon\u2014is a valuable tool. If someone feels short of breath, but oxygen levels are OK, the problem is likely due to vagal inflammation, not permanent alveolar damage. This occurs in roughly 27% of long-haulers. What happens is the inflamed vagus signals the diaphragm to tighten, causing a sensation of constriction. It's alarming but it does not mean there's an oxygen deficit. An oximeter can assure that oxygen is sufficient despite the sensation. This can avert panic and hyperventilation. Cardiac involvement: If a patient had cardiovascular problems tied to Covid, and shows residual impairment, think about treating with coenzyme Q10, acetyl carnitine, magnesium, and D-ribose. This needs to be coordinated with whatever conventional therapies the patient was prescribed by his/her cardiologist. Here, too, pulse oximetry provides insight. If someone has an oxygen saturation of 93 at rest, and then it drops when they walk, that's a sure sign there is actual cardiac or lung involvement, and not just vagal nerve inflammation. Loss of smell and/or taste: This is a unique feature of Covid. While many patients find that the problem resolves over a few months, for others it persists. These patients will benefit from 25-50 mg of zinc. Smell and taste are highly dependent on zinc, and also vitamin A. These two nutrients work together. For men, I recommend 8,000 IU per day of retinol. That's safe for men, but could potentially cause birth defects if a woman gets pregnant. The minimum RDA for vitamin A is about 3,000 IU for men, and 2,500 IU for women. So, 8,000 is not exactly a megadose. But I don't recommend it for women. Direct Brain involvement: Brain fog often follows Covid, and is part post-viral syndromes in general. If someone has brain fog alone, and not fatigue or other symptoms, it suggests direct brain involvement. In these cases, curcumin, antioxidants, and low-dose naltrexone are helpful. I give 750-1,500 mg of curcumin twice daily, and clinical glutathione twice daily, for 2-3 months. It's like putting out a fire\u2014we have to quench inflammation and oxidative stress. A small number of people have post-Covid encephalopathy, clots, or stroke. For them, conventional medicine is the best way to go. Allostatic Load & Long-Haul Risk Severe stress during the initial viral phase raises the odds of long-haul. If someone is not able to rest while ill with Covid, this also raises risk. It's all about allostatic load\u2014the total stress index. When you get beyond a certain stress level, you trip a hypothalamic circuit-breaker which controls sleep, hormones, and autonomic function. Once you trigger that circuit-breaker, you get CFS and fibromyalgia. Energy drops, you experience insomnia and/or non-restorative sleep. Helping People Sleep Sleep problems are common in post-viral syndromes. In most cases, this is not due to poor sleep hygiene but rather to hypothalamic dysfunction. As a holistic practitioner, you probably have some preferred sleep supplements and herbs that you recommend. I find sustained release melatonin to be helpful. I also formulated a mix of six ingredients (Valerian, Passionflower, Hops, Lemon Balm, 5-HTP, and L-theanine) that can be helpful. There are lots of natural options. Herbs tend to help people stay asleep, but they do not always help people fall asleep. So, many of these patients will need prescription drugs in addition to natural remedies. I use Trazadone (25-50 mg), Cyclobenzaprine (2.0 to 2.5 mg), and Gabapentin (100-300 mg). Zolpidem (Ambien) may also be helpful, at low doses of 5-10 mg. I keep doses low\u2014just enough to get the desired effect. Tiny doses of several things, instead of high doses of one, will create an additive effect without the 'hangover' the next day. It's akin to the traditional Chinese medicine approach of using small amounts of different herbs. This is how it should be with prescription drugs too, especially in this population, because they often have trouble detoxing drugs. Because they're not sleeping well, many of these patients lack energy during the day. Rather than caffeine or pharmaceutical stimulants, I recommend a form of Red Ginseng known as HRG80. It is hydroponically grown, so it is much less expensive than wild Ginseng, and it is very high in active constituents. I take it myself, and I'm very impressed. I studied it in 188 post-viral fatigue patients, 60% of whom improved. There was quite a dramatic increase in energy and stamina. Mitigating Viral Reactivation There are some viruses that the body kills off totally, and others like herpes, chicken pox, and EBV that the body never fully eliminates. The reasons for that are not clear. But when immunity goes down, you see a jailbreak, and these other viruses reactivate. For example, shingles is a jailbreak of the chicken pox virus. It shows up in the skin, and it is very obvious, so mainstream medicine can't ignore it. A similar process happens in other bodily systems, but instead of a big rash, it manifests as fatigue, muscle pain, etc. This is the \"I\" in SHINE\u2014the other residual infections. Reactivation is very real. We need to treat latent infections like candida and other fungi, and latent viruses. If someone has chronic nasal congestion, sinusitis, post-nasal drip, or irritable bowel syndrome, or intense sugar cravings, assume there's chronic candida and treat with Diflucan. If someone has chronic flu-like symptoms, I give Famciclovir (500-750 mg, 3x/d) and plus an NSAID. Celecoxib (Celebrex), it turns out, has antiviral effects. I'm targeting EBV, HSV1, any of the other herpes viruses. Give the combination for 4-6 months. It takes 2-4 months to see effects. By applying therapies that have proven effective in the aftermath of other viral infections, we can go a long way in helping our post-Covid patients recover quickly. -END- Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, is one of the most frequently quoted integrative medical authorities in the world.

Repair of the endothelial glycocalyx is a vital element in the restoration of cardiovascular health, according to Mark Houston, MD, director of the Hypertension Institute at Saint Thomas West Hospital, Nashville. The endothelial glycocalyx (EGX) \u2014literally \"sugar coating\" in Greek\u2014is a very thin gel-like layer that lines the luminal surface of the blood vessels. It is a carbohydrate-rich mesh of membrane-bound and soluble glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans, which create a non-adherent shield. Damage to this sensitive, bioactive layer is one of the earliest steps in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, Dr. Houston said at the 2022 Integrative Healthcare Symposium. \"Endothelial dysfunction is the starting point of CVD, and the EGX is the primary protector of the endothelium. Therefore, maintaining a healthy EGX may be one of the most important intervention targets for prevention of CVD.\" A \"SMART\" Barrier To understand the importance of the EGX keep in mind that the vascular endothelium is not passive. It actively controls passage of nutrients, oxygen, and hormones into and out of the bloodstream. It is also a key player in immunity and inflammation. Through production of nitric oxide, it regulates blood pressure. \"The endothelium affects the structure and function of every other organ system,\" Houston explained. \"Whatever the glycocalyx does, the endothelium does as well.\" According to Dr. Houston, the glycocalyx is a \"SMART\" barrier: Selective: It is selectively permeable, preventing cholesterol, platelets, leukocytes, and other circulating blood components from sticking to vessel walls, but allowing passage of nutrients, dissolved gases, and signaling molecules. Micro-thin: The thickness of the EGX varies with the thickness of the arteries it coats. It is generally in the range of 2-3 um in small vessels, and up to 4.5 um in larger ones like the carotids. Even at its thickest, it is still quite thin. It would take roughly 1,000 layers of EGX to equal the thickness of one sheet of paper. Antioxidant: The EGX harbors the antioxidative enzyme, reduces oxidative stress, nitric oxide (NO) available to the vasculature. Regulator: It regulates vascular permeability, inflammation, coagulation, and fluid The EGX contains brush-like structures in the 150-400 nm range, comprised of glycoprotein and proteoglycan chains. These sense the shear stress of blood flow, and signal the endothelium to produce nitric oxide when needed to regulate vascular tone. It also responds to chemokines, cytokines, and other molecular signals involved in vascular homeostasis. One of its primary functions is to protect the endothelium from thrombus formation. It blocks the binding of sticky leukocytes, activated platelets, and lipoproteins-especially LDL. It also contains anti-thrombin III, tissue factor pathway inhibitors, lipoprotein lipase, vascular endothelial growth factor, superoxide dismutase, and hyaluronic acid, all of which mitigate inflammation and resist thrombus formation. Negatively charged glycosaminoglycans within the EGX bind and inactivate sodium, rendering it non-osmotic and preventing it from accumulating in the endothelium. Thus, the EGX buffers against salt-induced arterial stiffness. Hyperglycemia & EGX Damage Damage to the EGX is a direct consequence of persistent hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress. It precedes all the vascular complications of diabetes. \"Endothelial dysfunction is the starting point of CVD, and the EGX is the primary protector of the endothelium. Therefore, maintaining a healthy EGX may be one of the most important intervention targets for prevention of CVD.\" Mark Houston, MD, Director, Hypertension Institute at Saint Thomas West Hospital, Nashville \"High blood glucose causes damage to glycocalyx, even in the so-called \"normal\" range. You want fasting blood sugars down to 75, and the A1c down to 5. Anything above that will increase risk because that's when the glycocalyx damage starts,\" Houston told IHS attendees. Many other things also contribute to glycocalyx degradation, including elevated TNF-a, hypervolemia, low fluid sheer stress, hyaluronidase, matrix metalloproteinases, atrial natriuretic peptide, and bacterial endotoxins. There's a clear and simple correlation between reduced EGX thickness and predisposition to lesion formation. Houston noted that in \"atheroprone\" regions of the vasculature-such as vessel branches, bifurcations, and curvatures\u2014the EGX is typically very thin. Restoring the Glycocalyx A number of treatments and factors can help to restore, regenerate, or maintain a healthy EGX, including: Hydrocortisone Calcium channel blockers Glycemic control via Metformin Sulodexide\u2014a highly purified mixture of glycosaminoglycans composed of low molecular weight heparin (80%) and dermatan (20%) Statins Reduction (SSP), and protein C But Dr. Houston holds that the single most effective and convenient option is Rhamnan sulfate (RS), a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from two types of marine algae (Monostroma Latissium and Monostroma Nitidum). These polysaccharides have similar glycosaminoglycans found in the human EGX. Rhamnan Sulfate: Safe & Effective Early in vitro experiments showed clearly that rhamnan sulfate can repair EGX damage caused by excessive glucose exposure. Animal experiments show that it prevents leukocyte adhesion, suggesting that it might prevent endothelial inflammation at its earliest stages. Rhamnan sulfate is available as a dietary supplement called Arterosil. This product also contains grape seed extract, green tea extract, and concentrated extracts from a host of heart-healthy fruits and vegetables. Supplementation with rhamnan sulfate can markedly increase arterial elasticity, a good indicator of endothelial function. In a study of 19 healthy humans at Baylor College of Medicine, daily supplementation with Arterosil increased carotid arterial elasticity by an average of 89.6% over baseline, within two hours of ingestion. \"Arteries are arteries. If it does this in the carotids, my guess is that it does it everywhere,\" said Dr. Houston. \"If you give a glycocalyx promotor, you can get increases of vascular compliance very quickly, and the functional changes beget structural changes.\" He added that he is now recommending Arterosil and other glycocalyx-promoting treatments to 100% of the patients in his clinic. \"The average increase in arterial elasticity is almost 90%, very significant improvements.\" Plaque Reversal Houston contends that conventional medicine's myopic obsession with lipids has blinded many physicians to the myriad other factors that drive vascular pathology. \"Even if you use statins and drive down LDL to 40, still 50% of patients will have events. Lipids are not the only problem in CAD. There are many other steps.\" That said, new evidence indicates that rhamnan sulfate can reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation, at least in mice. Notably, the plaque-reducing and anti-inflammatory effects were stronger in female versus male animals. Dr. Houston reported early data from an ongoing human pilot study of rhamnan sulfate in patients with vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, as confirmed by MRI-PlaqueView imaging. PlaqueView is the only FDA-approved software system for carotid plaque analysis. He pointed out that stenotic plaques account for less than 50% of all \"culprit\" lesions, whereas 75% of all events are attributable to ruptured non-stenotic plaques that trigger thrombus formation. Daily supplementation with a rhamnan sulfate product for two months led to a mean 64% regression of lipid-rich necrotic plaque\u2014the most dangerous type of plaque\u2014in the female participants, and a 47% regression in the males. There were also significant increases in vessel lumen diameter, suggesting a reduction of carotid stenosis\u2014a finding that has not been observed in statin studies. \"Rhamnan sulfate changes the morphology of plaques, making them more stable. These are very significant changes. Nothing else does this. No drug can do this. Statins reduce lipid-rich necrotic plaques by about 25%, which is meaningful, but not even close to what you get with the Rhamnan sulfate.\" These preliminary findings from China, have prompted a larger US-based study which is now underway. Houston stressed that plaque reversal is a gradual process. Typically, it takes about 6 months of twice-daily dosing to see reversal of carotid plaques. \"For really bad cases, you can take two caps, twice daily. The key is to split the doses, ideally 12 hours apart. It works better that way.\" \"Rhamnan sulfate changes the morphology of plaques, making them more stable. These are very significant changes. Nothing else does this. No drug can do this. Statins reduce lipid-rich necrotic plaques by about 25%, which is meaningful, but not even close to what you get with the Rhamnan sulfate.\" Mark Houston, MD, Director, Hypertension Institute at Saint Thomas West Hospital, Nashville Rhamnan sulfate does not break up plaques and cause fragments to float away. Rather it promotes resorption of the lipid core while simultaneously blocking deposition of lipids. It does this without actually affecting serum lipid levels. According to Dr. Houston, Aterosil is safe, and unlikely to interact adversely with medications. In fact, it is likely to be synergistic with Rosuvastatin (Crestor) and other statins. \"There are zero drug interactions with this. In combination with nearly everything we use, the interactions are generally good. If anything, it makes the drugs more effective.\" Impact on Blood Pressure Houston and his colleagues at the St. Thomas West Hospital studied Arterosil in a cohort of ten patients with uncontrolled hypertension. After three months of twice-daily dosing, the patients showed a decrease in mean systolic pressure from 151.5 mmHg at baseline, down to 147.5 at the three-month point. Diastolic pressure dropped from a baseline mean of 93.2 down to 82.3 mmHg. His team is currently looking at the impact of this product on diabetic neuropathy in a cohort of 20 patients. He says \"preliminary results are very promising.\" Potential Role in Covid Care The glycocalyx and its restoration has implications in the context of Covid-19. A healthy EGX may reduce susceptibility to viral infection, as well as the risk of severe Covid symptoms if one does get infected. Conversely, the Covid disease process can damage the glycocalyx, Dr. Houston explained. Early on in the pandemic, investigators at the Lawson Health Research Institute, Ontario, reported that ICU patients infected with the then-novel virus showed marked glycocalyx degradation compared with ICU patients who were virus-negative. This correlated with increases in thrombosis, depressed nitric oxide production, and increased platelet adhesion (Fraser DD, et al. Crit Care Explor. 2020). \"A therapeutic strategy based on glycocalyx protection would be effective for Covid-19 patients with both early and severe (e.g., ARDS) disease.\" Hideshi Okada, MD, Gifu University, Japan A team at the Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland showed that in human pulmonary arteries, the intact EGX strongly binds viral spike protein, \"but screens its interaction with ACE2.\" When the glycocalyx is reduced, ACE2 receptors on the surface of the endothelial cells are exposed, enabling the spike proteins to bind. The Krakow group concluded that susceptibility to Covid-19 may depend on the condition of the glycocalyx. A Greek research team showed strong correlations between reduced EGX thickness, oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and impaired cardiac performance in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Dr. Houston noted that \"even in mild cases of COVID-19, EGX damage can persist for up to four months, and has been correlated with a 10-fold elevation in oxidative stress compared to controls. If the ACE2 enzyme is low to begin with, something like Covid, which depletes ACE2, will cause big, big problems. This is what happens in very bad cases.\" It is notable that people on ACE2-sparing drugs tend to have milder Covid cases. \"You can increase the effects of ACE2 with a glycocalyx promoter,\" Houston says. In their excellent review of vascular injury in Covid-19, Dr. Hideshi Okada and colleagues at the Gifu University, Japan, point out that the endothelial glycocalyx is already very thin in pulmonary capillaries. Further degradation following an inflammatory cascade could be a major factor in acute and long-term Covid (Okada H, et al. Microcirculation. 2020). \"A therapeutic strategy based on glycocalyx protection would be effective for Covid-19 patients with both early and severe (e.g., ARDS) disease,\" writes Okada. \"A patient with comorbidity such as diabetes or hypertension would most likely exhibit an impaired glycocalyx function. Accordingly, their endothelial cells would not be fully protected and would be more susceptible to external (or internal) pathogens. In other words, the prevention of endothelial glycocalyx injury represents a useful means of systemic defense against infection.\" Blocking Viral Entry Researchers at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute showed in cell culture experiments that rhamnan sulfate binds the spike protein binding domains on SARS-CoV-2, inhibiting interaction with ACE2 and heparan sulfate on endothelial cell surfaces. The effect of the seaweed extract was stronger than that of heparin or of pseudoviral particles being tested as potential Covid treatments. Animal experiments at Chubu University in Japan suggest that rhamnan sulfate can directly inhibit influenza virus infection, while also promoting antibody production (Terasawa M, et al. Mar Drugs. 2020). They conclude that it is a potential candidate for the treatment of influenza virus infections A massive online survey of more than 5 million Americans shows that political affiliation is a major factor influencing peoples' decisions about the Covid-19 vaccines. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Pittsburgh, in partnership with CMU's Delphi Group, culled and analyzed data on vaccine attitudes from a larger national Covid survey that Delphi runs in collaboration with Facebook Data for Good. A total of 5,088,772 US adults responded between January and May 2021. Invitations to participate appeared at the top of Facebook users' news feeds in early 2021. At the time, Covid vaccine programs were just rolling out. Among other topics, the survey asked whether or not respondents would accept a Covid-19 vaccine if it were offered to them today. Those who answered \"probably not\" or \"definitely not\" were deemed \"vaccine hesitant.\" The questionnaire included questions about race, age, education, health status, geographical location, political preferences, and more. The researchers published their findings last December in the journal PLoS ONE (King, W et al. PLoS ONE. 2021. 16(12): e0260731). A total of 5,088,772 US adults responded between January and May 2021.Vaccine-hesitant individuals were generally younger, non-Asian, and held less than a 4-year college degree. They also tended to live in rural areas, and in counties with higher voting shares for Donald Trump. Vaccine hesitancy was up over 25% at outset of the survey (95%CI, 25.3, 25.5), but it dropped to 16.6% (95% CI, 16.4, 16.7) by May 2021. There were relatively large decreases among Black, Pacific Islander, and Hispanic participants, and also among those who had not gone to college. Within the cohort of vaccine-reluctant people several demographic, environmental, political, health, belief and behavioral characteristics stood out. Vaccine-hesitant individuals were generally younger, non-Asian, and held less than a 4-year college degree. They also tended to live in rural areas, and in counties with higher voting shares for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. They tended to work outside the home, expressed that they weren't worried about Covid, were less inclined to practice social distancing, and had not gotten a flu vaccine in the prior year. Of those who said they would \"definitely not\" get vaccinated, not trusting the Covid vaccine (59.2%) and not trusting the government (51.2%) were the most frequently cited reasons. Roughly half reported a fear of side effects (49.2%) as the reason for not taking the shot. Racial & Age Variables The researchers saw significant differences in vaccine attitudes by race and age subgroups. Intent to vaccinate also rose across all racial groups in the first six months of 2021. Respondents who identified as Black and Pacific Islander showed the largest shifts from hesitancy to acceptance. As of May, those two groups plus Hispanics and Asians all demonstrated less vaccine resistance than Whites. The data showed an interesting convergence of racial and age factors over time. For instance, in May 2021 toward the end of the survey period, young Black adults under 35 years old were more hesitant than Whites in the same age group. That pattern was reversed in people 45 years and older, with older Whites showing greater reluctance than older Blacks. \"There have been racial disparities in every aspect of the pandemic, from how hard different communities have been hit by it to access to healthcare resources,\" said Robin Mejia, special faculty at the CMU Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, and an author of the paper. In a press release about the study, Meija said communities of color have experienced disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Covid-related hospitalizations, and mortality throughout the pandemic. When vaccines first became available, acceptance varied dramatically across racial and ethnic groups. To Mejia, the overall decline in hesitancy within higher-risk communities is encouraging. Overall, hesitancy decreased by about one-third, from 25.4% in January to 16.6% in May. But those who strongly resisted vaccination at the outset tended to remain adamantly opposed even as time went on. Politicizing Public Health Participants from counties that supported Trump in 2020 showed a notably higher degree of vaccine hesitancy than those from counties with the fewest Trump supporters. This disparity grew wider during the study period. From January through May, Mejia's team identified a \"dose-response relationship\" between relative degree of local Trump support and Covid vaccine hesitancy. Even after controlling for potential confounding variables, those living in counties with the highest share of Trump 2020 votes were 44% more likely to be vaccine hesitant than those living in counties with the lowest level of support for the former president. \"This finding really highlights the politicization of public health recommendations,\" said Wendy C. King, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh. Vaccines Aren't Viewed Equally Another interesting finding is that Covid vaccine hesitancy appears to be \"a distinct phenomenon from general vaccine hesitancy among US adults.\" Only 14.7% of Covid vaccine resisters chose \"not liking vaccines\" in general, as a reason for avoiding the shots. That said, the people who had not taken flu vaccines in the past were 3.3 times more likely to express reluctance toward the Covid vaccine. Not surprisingly, people who reported that they were not intentionally avoiding contact with others (aka \"social distancing\") were more likely to be vaccine hesitant. This suggests there's a significant number of people who simply do not believe Covid is a real problem requiring precautions or preventive measures. There was a similar association between hesitancy and working outside the home, indicating that non-vaccinated individuals could be the likeliest to engage in activities with high transmission risk. Experience Mitigates Resistance As millions of Americans got their first Covid shots early in 2021, resistance did diminish somewhat in the months that followed. Overall, hesitancy decreased by about one-third, from 25.4% in January to 16.6% in May. But those who strongly resisted vaccination at the outset tended to remain adamantly opposed even as time went on. King and Mejia point out a small but significant segment of people with deeply entrenched aversions. \"The lack of change in prevalence of the 'definitely not' group implies those with strong feelings about the vaccine are not likely to change easily,\" said King. \"Thinking about how to reach that group and having messaging and incentives that that group will respond to is important.\" Though in general vaccine reluctance correlated inversely with education level, and those with lower educational levels showed high vaccine resistance rates early on, their acceptance rose by the end of the study. In fact, the largest drop in hesitancy occurred among respondents who had obtained no more than a high school education. Among individuals reporting higher education levels, hesitancy rates remained constant across the survey period. The authors note that having time to observe the initial months of the vaccine rollout likely played a role in shifting some groups' attitudes. A Likely Underestmate King and Mejia recognize some gaps in their research due to the study's unique design. They acknowledge that Facebook users who self-select to complete an online survey about Covid may differ from those who chose not to participate, and also from people who do not use Facebook at all. The survey sample also represented people with higher levels of education and higher overall vaccine uptake rates than other studies of the general population. For these reasons, they believe their findings may actually underestimate the true level of vaccine hesitancy. Though in general vaccine reluctance correlated inversely with education level, and those with lower educational levels showed high vaccine resistance rates early on, the largest drop in hesitancy occurred among respondents who had obtained no more than a high school education. 10% of Docs Reluctant A new study published by researchers at Texas A&M School of Public Health revealed a higher than expected level of vaccine skepticism among primary care physicians. This study, fielded in late May 2021, assessed vaccine attitudes among a representative sample of 737 practicing primary care doctors across the US. Data from 625 were included in the published analysis. Slightly over 10% of the respondents\u2014one out of every ten-did not agree that the Covid vaccines are safe, and 9.3% do not agree that they are effective (Callaghan T, et al. Vaccine. 2022) \"We thought it might be a very small proportion of physicians who hold hesitancy about vaccines given that we have lots of evidence of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. However, once we dug into the data, we found that concerns about vaccines in general were far more widespread in the physician population than we might have expected.\" Overall 67.4% of primary care physicians strongly agree that vaccines are safe, and roughly 75% strongly agree that they are effective (75.5%), and important (76.3%). \"We thought it might be a very small proportion of physicians who hold hesitancy about vaccines given that we have lots of evidence of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. However, once we dug into the data, we found that concerns about vaccines in general were far more widespread\" -Timothy Callaghan, PhD, Texas A&M School of Public Health But Callaghan called the vaccine skeptics \"a non-trivial proportion of primary care physicians.\" As was the case in the CMU general population survey, Callaghan's physician survey also showed strong correlations between political leanings and views on vaccines. For example, adjusting for all other covariates, Callaghan's team found that 78% of those who qualify as \"extreme liberals\" strongly agree that Covid vaccines are safe; among \"extreme conservatives\" that number was 59%. Extreme liberals were 18% more likely than extreme conservatives to strongly agree that vaccines are effective. Politics aside, contracting Covid itself was a big vaccine confidence-killer. Among primary care doctors that had not had the disease, 77% strongly agreed that vaccines are effective. This number dropped to 64% for those who'd had Covid-19. \"Holding all other covariates at their sample means, we find that while the predicted probability of strongly agreeing that vaccines are safe is 70% among PCPs who had not had COVID-19, it was only 54% among those who had,\" reported Callaghan. Though some have their reservations about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, the overwhelming majority of physicians in this survey \u2014nearly 95%-reported that they had been vaccinated against Covid. Many, if not most, work in clinics that required vaccination as a matter of policy. The COVID pandemic has clearly underscored the consequences of another American health crisis: the obesity epidemic. And it further emphasizes the necessity for integrating sustainable lifestyle practices that promote general health and wellbeing. In a sense, COVID tells a tale of two pandemics: one infectious, and one chronic and longstanding. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has permeated our everyday life for two years now, and many of our patients have had drastic changes in their lifestyles as a result. Community activities shut down, gyms closed, and many people became more sedentary. A lot of people started working from home, thus reducing their already minimal daily walking and movement. Even shopping has shifted online, and many people need only walk from the couch to the front door or the curbside to pick up their deliveries. Putting it simply, the pandemic has rendered many of us inactive, which is furthering our already alarming obesity rate. And we know that obesity and its related metabolic disorders are major COVID risk factors. The CDC reports that in 16 of the 50 states, 35% or more of all residents are now obese. That's up from 2018, when 9 states had a 35% prevalence. A CDC-sponsored study of more than 540,000 hospitalized patients hospitalized showed that COVID-19 was linked to underlying conditions such as obesity, diabetes with complications, and anxiety disorders were the strongest risk factors for severe COVID and death. What we have here is a vicious cycle: Obesity predisposes people to a severe COVID, but strategies aimed at preventing transmission of infection (work from home, online shopping, shuttering of social and recreational activities) promotes obesity. To help our patients navigate this tumultuous time, we need to address both of these pandemics, and teach people about lifestyle factors that can reduce the risk of both. Here are five sustainable ways for your patients to transform their health, maintain a healthy weight, and support their immune system. High-Protein Breakfast: Patients often come to us for dietary guidance. One of the best pieces of advice we can share is to eat a higher protein breakfast. A 2015 study of 28 overweight but otherwise healthy adolescents showed that eating a daily breakfast containing at least 35 grams of protein, can reduce 24 hour glucose variability, daily glucose peaks, and post-prandial glucose fluctuations (Bauer LB, et al. Int J Obes. 2015). It improves overall glucose control, thereby helping people maintain or work toward health weight. Of course it is also important to minimize fast foods, processed foods, and products laden with added sugars, artificial sweeteners, and trans fats. Physical Activity: Working out is an excellent way to lower obesity in the population. I believe it is part of our job as physicians to make sure that our patients engage in a workout routine of some sort that they enjoy and that won't lead to fatigue or injury. The American Heart Association recommends that healthy adults get 150 minutes (30 minutes, five days a week) of aerobic activity. This is easily accomplished with a 30-minute walk after dinner. If someone can't walk for 30 minutes straight, break it out into three 10-minute walks, or two 15-minute walks. If a patient has been completely sedentary, it's best to ease into physical activity rather than immediately jumping into an intensive routine. The main thing is to get people moving. Moderate exercise is crucial during this prolonged pandemic. A recent Kaiser Permanente analysis of data from more than 48,000 COVID patients showed that those who were routinely inactive had significantly higher risk for severe Covid-19 outcomes (hospitalization, ICU admission, death) than those who consistently met basic physical activity guidelines (Sallis R, et al. Br J Sports Med. 2021). Optimize Sleep: The CDC recommends that adults aged 18-60 years get seven or more hours of sleep per night. The reality is that our patients might be sacrificing sleep to accomplish other goals such as work, social or familial responsibilities. Sleep is essential for physiological and neurological rest and repair. It also plays a central role in maintaining healthy weight and sleep deprivation impedes the ability to lose weight. University of Chicago researchers showed that people sleeping 8.5 hours lost 55% more body fat than those sleeping an average of 5.5 hours, while following exact same moderately restrictive diet (Nedeltcheva AV, et al. Ann Intern Med. 2010). More than 20 chemicals have been identified as obesogens, many of which are estrogenic in that they easily bind to estrogen receptors. The five obesogens most commonly found in the home are Bisphenol-A (BPA), Phthalates, Atrazine, Organotins, and Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA). Reducing to these chemicals is as simple -or as complex\u2014as paying attention to the types of personal care, cosmetics, and household products one purchases. Choosing the ones that are free from some or all of these compounds. It is also wise to minimize the use of plastic containers for food storage or preparation, since plastics are a major source of obesogenic substances. Glass, stainless steel, and ceramic options abound, and they are much safer. Optimize Vitamin D Levels: For overall health improvement, this is one of the easiest changes to implement. Taking a vitamin D supplement is a completely sustainable habit that can have a tremendous impact on patient health, especially for people living in northern latitudes that do not get as much sun exposure. There's ample evidence that low vitamin D correlates with high COVID risk. A study from the first year of the pandemic showed that vitamin D deficiency was associated with a six-fold increase in severe disease from COVID-19 and 15-fold risk of death, so this is a healthful, timely and easy resolution (Radujkovic A, et al. Nutrients. 2020). Since then, many other studies have been published, from all over the world, showing this inverse correlation. Beyond vitamin D, many other nutrients can be helpful for immune system support. Getting a better snapshot of your patient's immune system can help you to tailor your suggestions. Cyrex Laboratories, a clinical laboratory specializing in functional immunology and autoimmunity, has developed a test panel called the The Lymphocyte MAP. The Lymphocyte MAP screens the integrity of the immune system to define a patient's immune status and immunotype(s) based on 29 key biomarkers and determinants. It tells you a lot about the current status of a patient's immune system so that you can provide guidance on adjustments that will bolster immune response. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge, this can be vital information as we work to help our patients fight not only the virus, but the broader pandemic of obesity and metabolic dysregulation.

In early January, I travelled to Mexico to attend the Dead and Company \"Playing in the Sand\" music festival at a resort in Cancun. The entire resort was booked by the festival promoter for attendees, and the staff were extremely careful and diligent about Covid-19 prevention measures. All attendees needed to provide proof of vaccination, and a negative coronavirus PCR test within 48 hours of arrival. On arriving, we all had to take rapid antigen tests which had to read \"negative\" in order for us to enter the hotel grounds. Unfortunately, many of the performers and crew members tested positive upon arrival in Mexico. One of the musicians testing positive and not permitted to perform, was the guitarist/singer John Mayer\u2014a key player in the headlining Grateful Dead offshoot band, Dead and Company. With Mayer sidelined, and so many other musicians testing positive, the festival's promoter had no choice but to cancel the entire festival. Since they had good insurance, all festival-goers were refunded their money and allowed to complete their weeklong stay at a very nice beach resort in Cancun. The promoters clearly did the right thing in cancelling. And while all of the above-mentioned precautions were science-based, they were not foolproof. And they did not prevent me from getting Covid. The Most Infectious Organism The transmissibility of the Omicron variant should not be underestimated. This is the most infectious organism I have ever seen, and I've been treating infectious diseases for the past thirty years. Since Omicron causes less virulent disease in most vaccinated individuals, it may thankfully accelerate the move toward generalized herd immunity. But that should not be construed to mean it is harmless. How did I catch the virus? An impromptu jam with some fellow festival attendees is the most likely scenario. I had brought my guitar with me to Mexico, hoping to find some like-minded musicians to play with on the beach. Toward the end of my stay, as the festival crowds were thinning out, I decided to take my guitar out and play some music. There was a really nice, glass-enclosed kiosk overlooking the beach near my room\u2014a perfect place to sit down and play. Within a short time, I was joined by two other guitar players, a singer, and several other people happy to finally hear some live music! Everyone had a great time, and after a couple of hours of playing, we decided to meet again after dinner on the hotel's veranda to continue the concert. False Sense of Security None of us were wearing masks. We were all vaccinated, and we had tested negative on admission to the resort...right? The party continued for several hours after dinner, and it was a lot of fun. \"The transmissibility of the Omicron variant should not be underestimated. This is the most infectious organism I have ever seen, and I've been treating infectious diseases for the past thirty years.\" I went back to my room, finished packing and awoke the next morning feeling great. This was the first time since the beginning of the pandemic that I had spent a full week without being consumed by Covid-19 precautions, at least not while outdoors. But there was that singing session in that glass-enclosed atrium. After a week on the beach, I was ready to return to the US, pending one final step-a mandatory rapid antigen test the day before my departure. After a ten-minute wait, my antigen test came back negative. \"So far, so good.\" Then the bad news hit. While flying back to the States, I received a text from one of the musicians I played with: he had just tested positive and needed to stay in Mexico to isolate until he tested negative. Great...I had just spent several hours singing in close quarters next to this guy without a mask. Sure, I knew the risk I was taking, but I believed I was in a safe bubble. I was lulled into lowering my guard by the beautiful surroundings, and the wonderful feeling of not worrying about Covid for a little while. A Raging Sinus Battle My symptoms began the day after I arrived home. I initially felt like I had a combination of a flu and a really bad head cold. I could tell that a battle was raging in my nasal passages and sinuses, though thankfully I did not have a cough or any lung involvement. Not surprisingly, my PCR test came back positive. My symptoms included profound fatigue, a low-grade fever of 99.5 degrees, incessant sneezing and profound rhinorrhea (nasal discharge). I knew I had been infected with Omicron because this infection had no interest in my lungs-a major difference with this variant. It is highly attracted to the nasal passages and less attracted to lung tissue. Though I was fully vaccinated and boosted, I'm also in my sixth decade, which means that a Covid-19 infection is nothing to take lightly. I isolated myself at home and began the treatment regimen listed below. After three days of symptoms, I was steadily improving. After one week, I was completely recovered. After ten days, I felt better than ever. The infection cleared and I have no residual symptoms. What Worked for Me This is the treatment program I would recommend to any of my patients who test positive for Covid-19: 1. K-PAX Immune 4 tabs 2x/day: This is an immune-boosting formulation I helped develop which contains zinc, vitamin C, B vitamins, and a clinically proven mitochondrial cocktail to support the immune system. 2. Vitamin C: 1,000mg, 2x/day 3. Vitamin D: 5,000 units, 2x/day 4. 325mg, 1-2 tabs 2x/day: Aspirin acts as an anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic. It also prevents blood clotting, which has been linked to long Covid symptoms. 5. Allegra-D 12-hour antihistamine/decongestant: 2x/day: A combination of product suppresses histamine and lessens rhinorrhea and swelling of the mucous membranes. Swollen nasal passages can play a role in the loss of smell associated with Covid. 6. Low dose steroids (equivalent to Prednisone 2mg) 2x/day: This will suppress an overly aggressive inflammatory response and the collateral organ damage it can cause. 7. Nebulizer treatments with diluted, medical grade hydrogen peroxide: Breathing nebulized hydrogen peroxide (start with 1 part 3% food grade hydrogen peroxide to 4 parts normal saline) for 10 minutes, twice daily, kills virus particles within the nasal passages and sinuses on contact. This thereby lowers the overall viral burden. Check out my video on exactly how to do this. My experience with Covid-19 left me with the following thoughts and perspectives: The current mRNA vaccines are a medical miracle. I'm sure having a surplus of antibodies ready to spring into action helped me a lot. Natural therapies work. Plain and simple. Ivermectin and monoclonal antibodies are not necessary to treat most Covid-19 infections. Unvaccinated individuals are 20 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than vaccinated individuals. Vaccinated and boosted individuals are 97 times less likely to die from Covid-19 than unvaccinated individuals. Jon D.

The so-named \"Disinformation Dozen\" includes Joseph Mercola, Robert Jr, Sherry Tenpenny, Sayer Ji, Kelly Brogan, Christiane Northrup and others who have been vociferous vaccine critics long before COVID. The White House drew heavily from CCDH's language as it leaned on Facebook\u2014an effort that was only partially effective. The people on CCDH's list are still findable on Facebook, though much vaccine-related content has been squelched. CCDH is a non-profit headed by former investment banker and UK parliamentary advisor Imran Ahmed. Its stated mission is \"to disrupt the architecture of online hate and misinformation.\" The Disinformation Dozen report urges social media platforms to take swift action to stem the spread of vaccine misinformation by\u2014among other things- de-platforming the individuals listed. Before going further, I want to state that I am not \"anti-vax.\" I am vaccinated against COVID-19, as are all of HPC's key team members. I believe vaccines do play a role in mitigating the severity and scope of the pandemic. Though they're clearly not 100% effective, nor entirely free of adverse events\u2014very few medical interventions are\u2014the benefits seem to outweigh the risks, on a population level. Likewise, Holistic Primary Care has never taken an \"anti-vax\" or anti-pharma stance, though we have published articles that could be considered vaccine-critical, and we do report on the detrimental ways in which entrenched corporate interests- pharma, health insurance, or information technology-affect the practice of medicine. I am familiar with most of the people on the Disinformation Dozen list. I've had my own qualms about the manipulative, fear-mongering tactics some use to attract attention, build followings, and market products. Some of them spout sheer lunacy, others use deliberately provocative language to gain attention. I share many of CCDH's core concerns. Dangers of Censorship That said, the administration's attempt to push Facebook into censorship is problematic for several reasons. For one, government involvement in the exchange of information is always a slippery slope. There's a fine line between barring deliberate misinformation and censoring legitimate dissent. It is never easy to find the balance between the sometimes conflicting ideals of open communication and truthful communication. In our era of gang-fight politics and high-stakes economics, that task is even more difficult. In the long term, the pandemic of distrust will be far more threatening to the wellbeing of the nation than SARS-CoV-2 or any other pathogen. And it will be even more difficult to cure. By its nature, the internet is a bewildering vortex of facts, quasi-facts, extrapolations, opinions, outright fabrications, and manipulative marketing tactics. One could argue\u2014and many have\u2014that the government and the major online media players need to do more to create a level, honest playing field for exchange. But when the government presses a private company to censor specific individuals, it has crossed a line into direct state control of information and opinion. That makes me nervous. Dissent vs Hate Secondly, it is troubling that the CCDH\u2014and by extension the White House\u2014has conflated vaccine dissent with \"online hate.\" According to the organization's name, hate speech is CCDH's main focus. Why, then, is this group concerning itself with vaccine dissent? In its mission statement, CCDH says it is committed to neutralizing what its founders see as a \"Digital Counter Enlightenment\"\u2014a confluence of fringe movements trafficking in racism, ethnic nationalism, anti-feminism, denial of climate change, and medical misinformation. CCDH contends that these movements work together to erode tolerance and democracy. The concerns are legitimate, and CCDH's campaigns raise important issues. There's no question some vaccine critics perpetuate factually inaccurate, biased, or otherwise debatable claims. That constitutes misinformation\u2014of which there is a plethora online, and not just about medical subjects. But it is not necessarily driven by hate, or a desire to destroy democracy. To equate vaccine skepticism with \"online hate\" sets a dangerous precedent; it categorically vilifies critics of a particular medical intervention as purveyors of malice. What if that standard is applied to people who publicly question other conventional \"standards of care\"? CCDH and the Biden administration may be earnest in wanting to safeguard public health by quelling the deliberate spread of false information. But not all dissent from scientific consensus is misinformation. And the algorithms used by social media platforms are not known for their nuance or discernment. Any campaign to rid the internet of fake news and hate speech also runs the risk of squelching all debate, thereby destroying the very tolerance the campaigners wish to protect. Economic Motives CCDH repeatedly points out the economic motivations of vaccine critics, contending that \"the most influential anti-vax entrepreneurs use Facebook as the mouth of a marketing funnel that directs potential customers from social media content to newsletter signup pages, and from there to free video content and finally paid content or products.\" Societies do not function well when vast segments of the population have lost basic belief in the goodwill of the people and institutions meant to serve them. CCDH also holds that the social media accounts of those on its list are backed by non-disclosed for-profit companies and/or non-profit groups working in tandem to create a shadow industry of medical misinformation. The social media companies themselves are pulling in up to $1 billion annually from advertising and other revenue streams associated with the \"anti-vaxx industry,\" CCDH claims. \"They want to persuade people not to trust doctors, and to trust them instead. So they can sell them false cures and books, access to websites, access to their email platforms. Which gives them data which they then can monetize in other ways,\" says Mr. Ahmed in an interview with the Denver Museum of Nature & Science's Institute for Science & Policy. Some vaccine critics have indeed built lucrative online businesses selling information, health products, or both. That's opportunism, but not necessarily hate. Further, the CCDH itself is not fully transparent about its own funding. Its website states only that it is supported by \"philanthropic trusts and members of the public.\" A group that calls out the financial interests of others ought to be more up front about its own. And it is not like vaccine-makers operate as charities. According to a report in Health Affairs last Spring, the federal government spent nearly $12 billion in advance purchases of the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. That's on top of the billions of public dollars invested in private sector vaccine development. High Stakes I realize there's a lot at stake here. COVID has so far killed 5.6 million people worldwide, according to Worldmeters.info, and over 900,000 in the US. The Biden administration, and most medical professionals, believe vaccines\u2014imperfect though they are\u2014remain our best bet for mitigating the pandemic. Not all dissent from scientific consensus is misinformation. And the algorithms used by social media platforms are not known for their nuance or discernment. Some use the \"Yelling 'Fire' in a movie theater\" analogy to justify censorship of vaccine dissent. The simple logic goes: vaccine skeptics discourage people from getting the shots, which raises the odds of transmission and disease severity, which puts others at risk and burdens the healthcare system. Therefore, anti-vaxxers cause harm to others. On one level that argument holds. But it misses important nuances. In the movie theater analogy, the shouter intentionally causes chaos for its own sake. The moviegoers are all at equal risk of being trampled, and they have no recourse. The COVID scenario is different. It is wrong to assume all vaccine critics deliberately aim to cause harm. Some might have malicious motives, and others may be capitalizing on fear. But still others have earnest concerns about safety, the encroachment of government mandates in a 'free' society, or both. Further, those of us who do believe vaccines are protective still have the option of getting the shots. Unlike the hapless moviegoers, we can still mitigate our own risk. The movie theater argument would be stronger if vaccines delivered ironclad efficacy against viral transmission. The Omicron surge has shown that at least in terms of viral transmission, the shots are only partially effective. Many vaccinated people got-and presumably transmitted-Omicron. While the vaccines mitigated the odds of severe disease, some of these people did get pretty sick. But all the arguments for or against censorship miss a critical point: people make their decisions about vaccines based on what and whom they trust\u2014and what they distrust. Why People Resist The truth is, beneath the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a raging pandemic of distrust. Many people no longer trust that elected officials, the mainstream medical systems, or the corporate world have their best interests at heart. If someone does not trust the source, no amount of data will be convincing. It is easy to broad-brush all vaccine critics as irrational, anti-science reactionaries drunk on QAnon and caught up in Braveheart fantasies. But to do so is intellectually lazy and inaccurate. While some fit the stereotype, others are intelligent, well-read, and reasonable. They are also quite diverse, and they are refusing the shots for different reasons. Some\u2014especially those with autoimmune diseases or histories of adverse vaccine reactions\u2014are legitimately concerned about safety. They're not reassured by population stats, and they resent being ostracized as selfish or ignorant simply because they fear potential reactions. Statistics and epidemiology are, essentially, sciences of generalization; adverse effects are individual experiences. In the age of personalized medicine, this perspective has some traction. Other vaccine resisters point out that the government and most of mainstream healthcare have put all the public health eggs in the vaccine basket, while ignoring or dismissing other potentially protective interventions. And I'm not talking about controversial off-label drugs like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine, but simple, safe, low-cost things like vitamin D, zinc, quercetin, N-acetyl cysteine...the list is long. It's true there's no ironclad evidence that any of these prevent COVID. But for many of them\u2014and especially for vitamin D-the epidemiologic patterns are clear and consistent, and the mechanisms of action are plausible. It is right to ask why there's been so little public health interest in these cheap, widely accessible, and potentially helpful agents. Many people simply do not trust Big Pharma, and with good reason. From the opioid crisis to predatory drug pricing, Big Pharma has provided plenty of fodder for mistrust. Biotech has been anything but transparent about the flow of genetically modified organisms into agriculture and food production, and the federal government has never required disclosure. Are you surprised that a lot of people are nervous about vaccines based on genetic manipulation of viruses? It is easy to broad-brush all vaccine critics as irrational, anti-science reactionaries drunk on QAnon and caught up in Braveheart fantasies. But that's intellectually lazy and inaccurate. While some fit the stereotype, others are intelligent, well-read, and reasonable. They are also quite diverse, and they are refusing the shots for different reasons. In immigrant communities, and especially among undocumented immigrants, there's a fear that showing up for COVID shots raises risk of deportation. That fear may be unfounded, but there's enough anti-immigrant sentiment, mistreatment of undocumented people, and inaction on rational immigration policy to prompt many immigrants to keep a very low profile. Some people object to the vaccines on religious grounds, though none of the major religions provide overt doctrinal support for an anti-vax stance. Religious objection may irk public health-minded medical folk, but it's difficult to counter in a nation that promises freedom of religion. Finally, there are many people across the political spectrum who are concerned about the rise of authoritarianism and the use of technology to impose social control. Public health is a convenient pretext for constraining civil liberties, and some see vaccine mandates and immunity passports as evidence of a totalitarian slide. To find cause for that concern, one need only look at China's relentless pursuit of a \"zero COVID\" goal (after initially denying the reality of the virus in late 2019). Total eradication seems like a noble ideal on paper. In practice, it is clearly repressive. On top of all these concerns, there's been so much corruption, malfeasance, and despicable behavior among politicians regardless of party affiliation, that it should be no big surprise that so many people are distrustful. Societies do not function well when vast segments of the population have lost basic belief in the goodwill of the people and institutions meant to serve them. In the long term, this pandemic of distrust will be far more threatening to the wellbeing of the nation than SARS-CoV-2 or any other pathogen. And it will be even more difficult to cure. I don't know how we remedy this social malaise, how we restore public trust. But I know the problems will not be resolved through censorship, vilification, and blame-casting. This illness needs a different kind of medicine. Clashes over vaccine mandates are the latest rifts defining a deeply politicized pandemic culture. In some states, local vaccination rules directly contradict national public health directives, putting hospitals and clinics in the difficult position of determining how to best safeguard patients and staff, amid a shifting landscape of conflicting directives. I am watching one such vaccine mandate war unfold from my adopted home in rural Montana. Here, a new state law makes it illegal for employers\u2014including hospitals and medical clinics-to discriminate against workers on the basis of vaccination status. That rule conflicts with the Biden administration's recently upheld federal vaccine requirement for healthcare workers, putting the burden on hospital administrators to determine which law they're going to follow. Direct Conflict In May 2021, Montana became the first state to introduce legislation banning vaccine mandates for workers. Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) signed House Bill (HB) 702, just months after he assumed office. Codified under Montana's Human Rights Act, the bill defines employee vaccine requirements as \"discrimination.\" It prohibits businesses from imposing vaccine rules on workers and claims to safeguard patients' \"personal and sensitive [healthcare] information\" and medical record privacy. By Fall, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for nearly all workers at facilities that receive federal funds through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). That rule includes hospitals, nursing homes, and other health clinics. Eschewing the CMS vaccine rule could result in major revenue shortfalls if CMS enforces the mandate. That could lead to hospital and clinic closures and, \"drastically reduce access to healthcare services for Montanans . Several health systems throughout Montana promptly announced their intention to comply with the new federal regs. But that puts these networks in direct conflict with Gov. Gianforte and the state's new law. Surging Caseloads Montana has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country: 54% of the state's population of just over 1 million are fully vaccinated as of mid-January. Roughly 3,000 Montanans have died from COVID-19, the third leading cause of death in the state in 2020. Though prevalence and mortality are relatively low compared to more populous and urban states, the pandemic is taking a severe toll on some Montana communities. The state is home to one of the country's largest Native American populations, and COVID was the top cause of death in Montana's native communities in 2020. All-cause mortality among American Indian Montana residents increased by 36% that same year, compared with the previous five years. Last October, when COVID hospitalizations surged, some Montana facilities had to implement crisis of care standards and care-rationing protocols. Hospitalizations are once again rising sharply across the state as Omicron spreads. A Threat to Access More than a half a million Montanans receive coverage through Medicare and Medicaid. Data released late last year indicate that nearly 40% of the state's population relied on the federal programs in 2020. \"Payments received from Medicare and Medicaid help support services available to all of us,\" said MHA president and CEO Rich Rasmussen in a recent statement. CMS funding represents 70% of all revenue at Montana hospitals, and is \"critical to the financial viability and continued operations\" of medical centers statewide. According to the Montana Hospital Association (MHA), eschewing the CMS vaccine rule could result in major revenue shortfalls if CMS enforces the mandate. That could lead to hospital and clinic closures and, \"drastically reduce access to healthcare services for Montanans over 65 years of age, working and low-income families, pregnant women and children, and people with disabilities.\" In other words, elderly and high-risk individuals who already have limited access to healthcare, would have their access further compromised. With the Supreme Court's split decisions\u2014supporting CMS but dashing OSHA-it's now up to individual employers to determine how the final rules impact their businesses. The Court did not explicitly address the question of how, on a practical level, federal rules apply in places like Montana, with conflicting state-level laws. \"Failure to comply (with the CMS mandate) means that CMS could terminate our participation in the program, which will threaten our ability to care for those in our services,\" reported Logan Health, a hospital system based in northwestern Montana. In November, Logan announced that its more than 4,000 employees must be fully vaccinated for COVID by early December in order to continue working onsite. The original CMS deadline for employee vaccinations was January 4. But in courts around the country, officials wasted no time challenging federal mandates. Louisiana and Missouri each filed separate actions questioning the legality of the CMS requirement. District court judges issued preliminary injunctions against the rule's enforcement in November, temporarily pausing the vaccine requirements for healthcare staff. Keeping Up with the Judges Those decisions forced medical centers to suddenly reverse course. Logan Health suspended its staff vaccination plan merely a week after rolling it out. On January 13, the Supreme Court issued a final ruling formally upholding the CMS regulation. It concluded that the Secretary of HHS acted within his authority when he determined that \"a vaccine mandate was \"necessary to promote and protect patient health and safety.\" \"Healthcare facilities that wish to participate in Medicare and Medicaid have always been obligated to satisfy a host of conditions that address the safe and effective provision of healthcare,\" the assenting justices wrote. That includes long-standing rules specifically addressing infectious disease prevention, control, and surveillance within medical settings--regulations created well before the threat of COVID-19. The justices also point out that staff vaccine policies to prevent other diseases are standard practice. \"Vaccination requirements are a common feature of the provision of healthcare in America,\" they write. Healthcare facilities nationwide already require shots against measles, mumps, and rubella, hepatitis B, and influenza as a condition of employment. In a press release shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, MHA's Rasmussen noted that, \"With the CMS COVID-19 vaccine requirement once again in place for healthcare facilities, Montana hospitals will adjust their policies to ensure compliance with the federal law. CMS has asserted this federal requirement takes priority over state and local law.\" But even if Montana's medical facilities do comply with CMS's requirements, other business sectors will abide by the state's mandate prohibition. Without strong federal vaccine standards for workers outside of healthcare, public health policy here and in other states will be governed by a patchwork of regional laws and executive orders. And these policies vary significantly from state to state. A Political Battle Mandates do raise overall vaccination rates. Data from a White House report on vaccine strategies show increased uptake in the vast majority of communities that have implemented requirements. The justices point out that staff vaccine policies to prevent other diseases are standard practice. Vaccination requirements are a common feature of the provision of healthcare in America. Healthcare facilities already require shots against measles, mumps, and rubella, hepatitis B, and influenza as a condition of employment. A recent Axios/Ipsos poll suggests that \"the majority of employed Americans support vaccine and mask mandates in their workplace.\" But while 60% support their employers' vaccine requirements, only 14% are supportive of firing colleagues who do not comply. Even as the Omicron wave engulfs health centers around the country, opposition to vaccine mandates remains strikingly high, especially in Republican-governed states. For some, the rapid spread of Omicron-even among fully vaccinated people-is evidence that the shots are ineffective, and therefore, unnecessary. Twenty states--all with Republican governors--currently prohibit businesses or government agencies from requiring people to prove that they're vaccinated. Some governors are using emergency orders to halt \"proof-of-vaccination\" requirements for entry into restaurants, community events, and public activities. Others, including Montana, ban vaccine rules or \"immunity passports\" via permanent legislation. State laws in Florida ban employer vaccine mandates, prohibit school face mask policies, and impose fines of up to $50,000 per worker on businesses that violate the state's anti-mandate rules, which\u2014in true Orwellian fashion-are described as \"employee health protections.\" The scene is markedly different in Democrat-led states. California, New York, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington permit businesses to prohibit entry of unvaccinated people and allow individuals with proof-of-vaccination to bypass restrictions that apply to non-vaccinated people. Eighteen states are taking a more hands-off approach, neither outlawing nor establishing vaccine requirements. To Treat or Prevent? The Biden administration pushed for a nationwide vaccination-or-test policy for businesses employing 100 or more individuals, via the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The Supreme Court's second January 13 ruling struck it down. Opponents of the OSHA mandate--private businesses and Republican-led states--accused the agency of overreach, claiming that authority to issue emergency public health rules falls under the purview of state and local governments only. Many also argued that the decision to take a vaccine should be a personal choice, not a requirement as a condition of employment. With the Supreme Court's split decisions\u2014supporting CMS but dashing OSHA-it's now up to employers to determine how the final rules impact their businesses. Rather than tightening prevention efforts, including vaccines, some politicians and business leaders are instead promoting a wait-and-treat approach. Their message, in essence, is take no precautions and wait until you catch COVID to do anything about it. That's based in the logic that only a small percentage of infected people will develop severe or fatal symptoms, and that effective therapies are on the horizon. There are indeed several promising new antiviral drugs that could change the course of the pandemic moving forward. While they will undoubtedly help save lives, the myopic focus on treatment overlooks the countless additional lives that could be spared through more intensive prevention efforts. Advocates of wait-and treat are also willing to ignore the overwhelming pressure that ill and unvaccinated COVID patients place on healthcare systems and practitioners. And they fail to acknowledge the staggering number of patients who develop long COVID. Few Walk-Outs A prevailing argument against jobsite vaccine rules is that many employees will quit their jobs, or choose to be fired, rather than get vaccinated. This is an oft-expressed fear in my community, where staffing gaps are a real and chronic concern. Many of Montana's rural counties are officially recognized as health professional shortage areas. Severe staffing inadequacies and limited access to services are perennial problems. COVID simply exacerbated existing issues in rural healthcare delivery. Do healthcare personnel really walk out in opposition to vaccine mandates? Sure, some do so, but not in large numbers. So far, healthcare systems with vaccine requirements are seeing only minimal staff loss. Fierce Healthcare recently published data from 59 hospitals and healthcare networks across the country that have implemented mandates: none report attrition rates of more than 1% of total workforce due to vaccine-related resignations or terminations. Do healthcare personnel really walk out in opposition to vaccine mandates? Sure, some do so, but not in large numbers. Healthcare systems with vaccine requirements are seeing only minimal staff loss. A 1% workforce loss is not nothing, especially in facilities already short-staffed. But neither is it the apocalypse that mandate critics predicted. That 1% walkout rate needs to be weighed against the number of medical professionals temporarily or permanently sidelined by COVID itself. \"A Menace in Work Settings\" Unsurprisingly, some of the country's most prominent medical organizations and experts support the OSHA vaccine requirement. The American Medical Association, American College of Physicians, National League for Nursing, American Public Health Association, and many others signed a joint statement expressing their collective backing of a broad federal mandate. Several also filed an amicus brief opposing legislative efforts to obstruct the requirement. In a January 13 press release, Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh defended the OSHA vaccine-or-test policy, noting that OSHA's current guidance basically just outlines the CDC's recommendations. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 grant OSHA the power to enact temporary emergency standards if \"employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards\" and if such emergency standards are deemed \"necessary to protect employees from such danger.\" According to the judges who backed OSHA's vaccine rule, COVID clearly \"poses grave dangers.\" \"The disease has by now killed almost 1 million Americans and hospitalized almost 4 million,\" they write. \"It spreads by person-to-person contact in confined indoor spaces, so causes harm in nearly all workplace environments...COVID-19, in short, is a menace in work settings.\" With the Supreme Court's split decisions\u2014supporting CMS but dashing OSHA-it's now up to employers to determine how the final rules impact their businesses. The Court did not explicitly address the question of how, on a practical level, federal rules apply in places like Montana, with conflicting state-level laws. Here, it remains technically impossible for clinics to comply with both federal and state law. Administrators and healthcare workers in our state remain in an untenable position. Gov. Gianforte has not yet issued a formal response to the CMS over-ride of his anti-mandate law. With further legal actions surely still to come, a fundamental question remains unanswered: whose health deserves to be protected during a public health emergency? As the Omicron blizzard sweeps across the country, so many questions have emerged. My comments here are based on available scientific data and, where indicated, on my clinical experience with the latest surge. Here are a few key points we can safely say we know about the Omicron variant: It is Highly Transmissible: Omicron is so highly contagious that no level of vaccination or prior infection will fully prevent transmission. The vaccines and prior bouts of COVID do help people resist serious illness, but their effect begins to wane after 3 months. Vaccine booster shots, despite the very high antibody levels they produce, begin losing their effectiveness after 10 weeks. The peak of infectivity, as measured by the amount of live virus in nasal swabs, occurs between 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms or the first positive test. The Omicron variant spreads readily outdoors. It does not require prolonged interpersonal contact, and is less impacted by the wearing of face masks or physical distancing than previous variants. Respiratory droplets can travel as far as 27 feet, and may stay airborne for as long as 15 minutes in still air. The CDC now recommends N95 and KN95 masks as masks of choice. Cloth masks alone are not likely to be effective. A study from Japan, not yet published, gives evidence\u2014not just opinion\u2014about the infectivity of the Omicron variant. The data show this: the peak of infectivity, as measured by the amount of live virus in nasal swabs, occurs between 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms or the first positive test. Infectivity probably starts before symptoms, as has been true for other variants. Live viruses persist for 10 days after symptom onset or first positive swab, and then rapidly fall off. The CDC's recent guidelines recommending just 5 days of quarantine are misguided and not based on this new evidence. Please note this in making personal and family decisions. Omicron May Manifest Differently Than Older Variants: Sore throat and stuffed nose are the usual symptoms of infection with Omicron in people who have some degree of COVID immunity. People lacking COVID immunity tend to be much sicker. At this time, if you think you have a cold, there is a 50% chance you have COVID-19. Get tested. Rapid antigen tests may yield false negatives, so if you have symptoms, get a PCR test, and repeat it in 48 hours if the test is negative but symptoms persist. If you test positive, notify anyone and everyone with whom you've been in contact. The exposure is likely to have occurred 4-5 days before the onset of symptoms, and you probably became infectious to others within 48-72 hours after exposure. Omicron May Not be as \"Mild\" as it Seems: The reported decrease in severity of Omicron compared to previous variants may be due to two factors: (a) Most people in the US already have some degree of protective immunity (from prior infection, vaccines, or both), (b) Omicron grows more readily in the upper respiratory passages and less readily in the lungs, when compared to previous variants. This growth pattern decreases the likelihood of severe pneumonia. But it may not decrease the likelihood of neurological problems, including the so-called \"Long COVID\" with its associated cognitive dysfunction. The virus can enter the brain directly from the nose. At this time, if you think you have a cold, there is a 50% chance you have COVID-19. Get tested. Anti-Viral Nasal Sprays Appear to Be Somewhat Protective: Heparin-based products do work to prevent viral attachment, but they need to be used regularly and frequently (about every 4 hours) in situations where exposure might occur. This includes living with someone else who is not as careful as you are. I recommend heparin as a nasal spray taken before and after any type of brief encounter with other people, and every 4 hours during longer encounters. The nasal mucosa is the main portal of entry for the virus into your body. The mucosal cells contain the highest co-concentration of the factors needed for SARS-CoV-2 to enter. The nose acts like an incubator in which the virus multiplies and from which it is inhaled into the lungs. Preventing or limiting viral entry into the nose has the potential to prevent or reduce systemic disease In July 2020 I designed a nasal spray containing low-dose heparin which is produced by compounding pharmacies. The concentration in this spray is 100 units per spray, which should be more than enough to saturate the virus, even when diluted by nasal secretions. At the low dose used, heparin does not kill the virus; but it prevents viral attachment to the lining of the nose. It is safe, simple, and stable. (Read Preventing COVID With Nasal Sprays). Monoclonal Antibodies Do Not Work Well for Omicron: Sotrovimab, the only monoclonal with demonstrated effects against Omicron, is limited in its availability. Pfizer's new anti-viral drug, Paxlovid, which was 89% effective at preventing hospitalization, also has very limited distribution. Paxlovid has a short lifespan in the body, so it is administered with another antiviral called Ritonavir, which interacts with many commonly-prescribed drugs. This makes it unsuitable for many people. Paxlovid works by inhibiting a coronavirus enzyme called 3CL-protease or the main protease. As I discuss in my free online Coronavirus Guidebook, there are many natural products that inhibit 3CL-protease. Among these are the flavonoid quercetin, and the herbs Andrographis paniculata and Houttuynia cordata. Specific protocols are available from my office and have been updated for 2022.
