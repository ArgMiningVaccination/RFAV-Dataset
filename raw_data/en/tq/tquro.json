Changes in l ifestyle and environmental factors like an increase in exposure to air pollutants, env ironmental tobacco smoke, or indoor allergen and pet exposure have been consider ed as plausible explanations. However, little evidence in support of these causal risk factors for these common chronic childhood diseases has been found. Lower ri sk of hay fever and atopic sensitisation were reported in children with a high er number of siblings, and later also in children who attended day-care centres early in infancy. These findings were summarised in the so-called 'hygiene hypothesis': L imited exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens during early childhood results in a higher risk of developing allergic diseases. A series of epidemiological studies in Europe, Cana da, and Australia showed reduced prevalence of asthma and allergy among farm ers' children compared to non- farmers' children. Stable visits early in life and consumption of raw cow's milk were suggested as the main factors of the farming enviro nment conferring protection against atopic diseases. These results have been se en as an extension of the 'hygiene hypothesis', since a farm environment prov ides an enormous habitat for microorganisms. Pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) of the innate i mmune system, such as toll- like receptors (TLR) or CD14, recognize LPS (lipopo lysaccharide), a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, and o ther nonviable environmental compounds. Activation of PRR signalling pathways in itiates regulatory mechanisms which in turn modulate the adaptive immune response . Interestingly, recently it has been shown that farmers' children express higher le vels of PRR than children from non-farming families suggesting that innate immune mechanisms are involved in the allergy-protective effect of the farming environmen t. For various genetic loci, i.a. the CD14 gene, an as sociation with the occurrence of atopic diseases have been described. However, studi es investigating the same genetic variants in other populations often failed to reproduce the original results. iv Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli Gene-environment interactions have been found for s everal genetic polymorphisms in PRR genes, therefore differing environmental exp osures between study populations might explain the conflicting results o f genetic studies. Objectives To assess factors of the farming environment that i nfluence the innate immune system with respect to gene expression of crucial p roteins of innate immunity pathways and test if this association is modulated by unknown genetic factors. We expected that results might give a deeper understan ding of the immunological pathways and the complex relationship between envir onment, genes and atopic disease. Methods The PARSIFAL study (Prevention of Allergy Risk fact ors for Sensitization In children related to Farming and Anthroposophic Life style) was a cross-sectional survey in rural areas of Austria, Germany, the Neth erlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. 14893 children aged 5-13 years belongi ng to four study groups (farmer's children, children attending Steiner schools, and t heir respective control groups) completed a standardised questionnaire including qu estions about asthma and allergy, the child's activities on farms, and chara cteristics of the home environment. In subpopulations, further data was available. Bloo d samples were obtained from selected children and tested for atopic sensitisati on, especially for specific IgE antibodies to common inhalant and food allergens. I ndoor dust samples were collected to determine exposure to microbial compou nds (LPS and fungal extracellular polysaccharides). Furthermore, gene xpression measurements and SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) of PRR were available. Results Gene expression of CD14, TLR2, and TLR4 was higher in farmers' children compared to non-farmers' children. Mainly prenatal factors accounted for these differences. Expression of PRR was higher in childr en when the mother worked on the farm during pregnancy. In addition, we observed a dose-dependent increase in gene expression of CD14, TLR2 and TLR4 with the num ber of farm animal species the mother had contact with during pregnancy, which probably serves as proxy for an Summary v increasing variation in microbial exposure. Prenata l factors also exert their effect on the child's health later in life. Children of mothe rs who worked on the farm during pregnancy were less sensitised at school age to com mon inhalant and food allergens than children of unexposed mothers. However, the de velopment of clinical symptoms of atopic diseases seemed to depend on exposures th at occurred postnatally. Farm milk consumption was significantly associated with lower prevalence of atopic sensitisation and atopic health outcomes. Of particular importance is the consistency of the findings across the four study g roups. The inverse association was not explained by concurrent farm activities of the child and was most pronounced in children drinking farm milk since their first year of life. Farm milk consumption and other specific farm-related exposures (pig farming, feeding silage, child's involvement in haying, and regular stay in animal sheds and bar ns) taken together explained the protective effect of being a farm child on asthma. Neither of the genotyped SNPs of innate immunity ge nes was directly associated with differential gene expression. However, a polym orphism in the CD14 gene (CD14/A-1721G ) significantly modified the effect of farm milk co nsumption on CD14 gene expression. Farm milk drinking children homozy gous for the A allele expressed significantly more CD14 than non-exposed children. No association between farm milk drinking was observed in children with the GG genotype, heterozygous children showed an intermediate difference in CD14 gene expr ession between exposed and non-exposed children. We observed the same interact ion between genotypes of CD14/A-1721G and farm milk exposure on asthma and related atopi c health outcomes. Moreover, we were able to replicate the g ene-environment interaction on atopic health outcomes in two independent populatio ns. We compared RNA quality in two epidemiological stud ies using different tubes for RNA sampling (EDTA and RNA stabilizing tubes). The amount of RNA that could be extracted from the blood samples was lower in the E DTA tubes leading to higher proportions of blood samples unavailable for measur ement of gene expression. Moreover, we found decreasing agreement between sam ples repeatedly measured suggesting RNA degradation over time. Important rec ommendations for future epidemiological studies measuring gene expression c ould be developed. vi Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli Conclusions and Outlook Whereas the manifestation of atopic diseases such a s asthma and allergies depends on postnatal exposures, protection against atopic sensitisation is conferred by prenatal exposure to a farming environment. Immu ne modulation by activation of innate immune mechanisms might underlay these obser vations. However, cross- sectional studies are not appropriate for drawing c onclusions regarding the temporal sequence of events and, therefore, our results need confirmation by longitudinal studies. The ongoing PASTURE cohort study will addr ess these questions as longitudinal clinical and immunological data will b e available. Biological data of the composition of farm milk was not available in PARSIFAL. Thus, the allergy-preventive ingredients contained in the farm milk are still unknown. Within the ongoing cross-sectional GABRIEL study mi lk samples from children's homes will be sampled and components analysed regar ding their allergy-protective potential. Our results of the genetic analyses are limited due to the insufficient power of the PARSIFAL study. In future the ongoing large-scale G ABRIEL study will allow adequately powered genetic analyses to be conducted . Genome-wide association studies and gene-environment-interaction studies in the GABRIEL population will result in a deeper insight into the genetics of ato pic diseases. Current scientific evidence has not developed stron gly enough to provide a reliable course of action for primary prevention or therapy. Infectious diseases resulting from exposure to pathogens continue to be a serious public health problem. However, further investigation and characterisation of environmental compounds conferring protection against atopic diseases is pr omising and will hopefully result in future efficient preventive measures.

Besides being the cause of extensive healthcare costs these diseases represent a physica l and psychological burden for the affected children and their families. In the co urse of the last century atopic diseases showed a steady increase in prevalence [2] . In Switzerland the prevalence in adults raised from about 1% in 1926 to 13% in 19 91 [3]. Nowadays, asthma is the third leading cause of hospitalization in U.S. chil dren under 18 years of age, exceeded only by pneumonia and injuries [4]. This p ronounced increase occurred in such a short time that experts refer to it as an \"a sthma epidemic\". Interestingly, this epidemic stands out through large regional differen ces. Whereas particularly 'westernised' countries have been affected by this rapid increase it occurred markedly less in developing countries. In Eastern G ermany where drastic changes towards westernisation of living conditions have oc curred after reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democrat ic Republic an increase in the prevalence of hay fever (from 2.3 to 5.1%) and atopic sensitization (19.3 to 16.7%) has been documented in children aged between 9 and 10 years of age [5, 6]. It has to be noted, however, that in the last decad e several authors have reported stabilizing prevalences of atopic diseases [7, 8]. I.II Environmental Risk Factors This alarming trend opened up a whole area of resea rch trying to identify the responsible factors for the 'allergic epidemic'. De novo occurrence of genetic mutations is unlikely to account alone for the chan ge in disease prevalence regarding the short time in which it was observed. Changes in lifestyle and environmental factors are therefore more plausible. Detrimental e nvironmental factors like air pollution increased indoor allergen exposure (due t o better house insulation, reduced indoor air ventilation and more carpeting on floors ) or common pet ownership offered an explanation. However, a clear causal association between the environmental 2 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli exposure to air pollutants like particulate matter, NO2, SO2, or ozone in Europe and the development of childhood asthma and allergy has not been found [9, 10]. However, a number of studies have shown that short- term increase of exposure to air pollution and environmental tobacco smoke results i n increasingly severe symptoms among asthmatic children [11-13] suggesting these f actors to be a triggering co- factor rather than a factor initiating or inducing the asthmatic state. Similarly, the increase in the prevalence childhood asthma and all ergy could not consistently be explained by increased indoor allergen exposure [14 -16] or pet ownership [17, 18]. Several studies have even demonstrated a lower prev alence of childhood allergy prevalence in children exposed to pets early in lif e [19-21] - an observation that might be in favour of the idea that also a decrease in allergy-protective rather than a increase in allergy-prone environmental factors acc ount for the increase in atopic diseases. II The Hygiene Hypothesis II.I Emergence of the Hygiene Hypothesis In 1989, Strachan et al. reported a lower risk of h ay fever and atopic sensitisation in children with a higher number of siblings [22]. He hypothesised that protection from allergic diseases might be acquired through infecti ons in early childhood, transmitted by 'unhygienic contacts with older siblings, or acq uired prenatally'. Thus, more children, less improved household amenities and low er standards of personal cleanliness may be protective against developing al lergic diseases. This interpretation is now known as the 'hygiene hypothe sis'. Kr\u00e4mer et al. infer that 'if this hypothesis is true, early exposure to childcare out side the home would protect against atopy by promotion of cross infections', an d she could show higher prevalence of atopy among children who started to a ttend day nursery at an older age than in those who started to attend it at a you nger age [23]. Since day-care attendance was more frequent among Eastern German c hildren compared to Western German children the aforementioned German s tudies were in line with this data. Data from a longitudinal study provided furth er evidence showing that growing up with older siblings and also early attendance of a day-care centre were protective against the development of asthma later in childhoo d [24]. The hygiene hypothesis was given further support from Matricardi et al. wh o demonstrated in Italian military General introduction and background 3 cadets an inverse association between seropositivit y of orofecal infections (hepatitis A, Toxoplasma gondii and herpes simplex virus 1), which may be regarded as a marker of poor hygiene, and atopy defined as a posi tive skin-prick test or increased specific IgE to common inhalant allergens [25]. II.II Extension of the Hygiene Hypothesis: Farm Stu dies Until then the idea behind the hygiene hypothesis w as that mainly exposure to living microbes and the number of undergone infecti ons confer to the protection against atopic diseases. However, reports that pers ons working with hay rarely suffer from hay fever go back as far as the 19 th century [26]. M. Gassner, a Swiss paediatrician from a rural area systematically coll ected serological data from 15-year- old school children in his village from 1983 and he observed that farmers' children suffer less from allergic diseases than their non-f arming peers from the same village [27]. The cross-sectional Swiss SCARPOL study, a mu lticentre study originally designed to investigate associations between air po llution and respiratory and allergic symptoms in school children, offered to in vestigate this observation in a larger sample. In the 1620 SCARPOL children aged 6- 15 years the prevalence of seasonal symptoms of hay fever and atopic sensitisa tion were significantly lower in children who were raised on a farm compared to non- farmers' children from the same rural areas [28]. The living conditions of farming families differed in this study population in many respects from living conditions of other families. Farming families had, in general, larger family sizes, higher number s of pets, were more likely to heat with wood or coal, mothers were less likely to smok e, homes had more indoor dampness, and the families differed in dietary habi ts. However, none of these factors could explain the strong inverse association betwee n atopy and growing up on a farm. The results were consistently confirmed in pe diatric populations from Finland [29], Canada [30], Australia [31], Austria [32] and Germany [33]. The latter investigated school children aged 5-7 years in rura l areas of Bavaria. The authors could show that contact with stable animals was inv ersely related to the prevalence of diagnosed hay fever, asthma and wheeze among far mers' children. Furthermore they observed a dose-response relationship of farmi ng (non-farming, part-time farming and full-time farming) and risk for atopic disease. 4 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli Box 1. Definition of farm milk . In this thesis farm milk is of particular interest; thus clarification of the expression farm milk is needed. Herein \"farm milk\" denotes f resh cow's milk which has undergone no further industrial processing like pasteurization or homogenisation. However, treatment on the farm before consumption like heating or skimming is generally not known and specifically mentioned if respective data is a vailable. II.III Which farm-related exposures protect from at opic diseases? The farming environment is a 'human model' of an environment rich in opportunities for exposure against microorganisms. Based on previous findings, research teams from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland designed 1999 the cross-sectional ALEX (Allergy and Endotoxin) study to assess the role of environmental and lifestyle factors that affect the prevalence of allergy. Analyses of the 812 farmers' and non-farmers' children of the ALEX population led to novel insights into how an environment rich in microbial exposure might confer protection for atopic diseases. Riedler et al. published intriguing results showing that children who have been in stables or have been drinking farm milk during the first year of life had less asthma and hay fever than children who were exposed later in life or not at all [34]. Interestingly, the lowest prevalence of asthma and hay fever was found in children who were exposed to stables and farm milk in the first year of life. However, the ALEX population did not provide enough power to dis entangle the individual effects of the two exposures. Further analyses of the ALEX data by Braun-Fahrl\u00e4nd er et al. revealed a negative association between exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS or endotoxin, see also section III.II), an integral part of the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and atopic asthma, hay fever and atopic sensitisati on [35]. Intriguingly, in the same publication an impaired innate immune response dete rmined by a down-regulation of cytokine production in children highly exposed to L PS was reported. The authors suggest that long-term, high-level environmental ex posure to LPS might favour a state of tolerance, which in turn prevents the deve lopment of allergic immune responses. II.IV The exposure has to take place early in life Exposures of the mother during pregnancy and its in fluence on the fetus have been investigated in some detail for other exposure s namely smoking [36], intake of General introduction and background 5 antibiotics [37] or paracetamol [38] or exposure to allergens [39]. There is also evidence from animal models that prenatal exposure to microbial compounds prevent allergic disease in the offspring [40, 41]. Similar ly, the aforementioned ALEX data did, in addition to provide evidence for a protecti ve effect of a farming environment, highlight the timing of exposure by demonstrating t hat the strongest effect was seen in children exposed to farm-related factors in the first year of life. Furthermore, in the same publication it was reported that children of m others who worked daily on the farm were less likely to develop asthma and hay fev er later in life compared to children of mothers who were less often or not at a ll active on the farm. Again the sample size of the ALEX study was too small to inve stigate whether prenatal or postnatal exposures had stronger effects on the chi ld's health. The larger PARSIFAL study provided enough power to investigate the ques tion of the timing of exposure in more detail. III Immunology Atopic diseases are characterised by exaggerated im mune responses to common, typically harmless proteins in our environm ent. Atopic patients are predisposed to the clinical manifestation of chroni c disorders like allergic asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic eczema, but also acute allergic reactions ranging from urticaria to anaphylaxis. This part of the introduction is intended to review the function of the human immune system and describe recent findings in immunological research to cross-link biological pat hways in the development of allergic disease and the observations of epidemiolo gical studies as discussed in the previous sections. III.I The immune system The human immune system recognizes and eliminates i nvading microorganisms in two ways: The adaptive or acquired immunity, con sisting of B and T cells, uses a vast set of antibodies and T cell receptors with a high specificity against any foreign pattern or peptide. The highly effective acquired i mmunity is responsible for elimination of infection in a late phase and for th e establishment of immunological 6 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli memory. By contrast, the innate immune system const itutes the first-line defence of a host to survive the early phase of infection. It re cognizes only a limited number of conserved structures of invading microorganisms thr ough a limited number of germ- line encoded receptors and it seems to be independe nt of immunologic memory [42]. Furthermore, innate immunity provides co-stimulator y molecules and cytokines to direct the adaptive immune response. III.II The innate immune system Pattern-recognition receptors The innate immune system has been highly conserved during evolution [43-45]. Germ-line encoded receptors recognize molecular str uctures not present in the host, but conserved among pathogens. Such structures are called Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMP) [46]. Cellular receptors recognizing such structures have been named Pattern-Recognition Receptors (PRR) [46] . The most prominent best- investigated exponent of the PRR is the toll-like r eceptor (TLR) family. The Toll protein was first described in Drosophila where it is a crucial regulator of the immune system. In mammalian, twelve homologue forms of the Toll receptor are described and called Toll-Like Receptors (TLR), constituting the principal family of PRR in mammals. Humans have 10 functional TLR while TLR11 is non-functional due to a stop codon in the gene. TLR12 has not been document ed so far. TLR are mainly expressed on cells of the immune system such as mac rophages, Dendritic Cells (DC), mast cells, B-cells and some T-cells [47]. No t all TLR are located extracellularly in the plasma membrane. TLR3, 7, 8, and 9 are found almost exclusively expressed in endosomal compartments. Based on their amino aci d sequence, human TLR can be divided into five subgroups, each recognizing re lated structures [48, 49]. Thus, the ligand recognition concept of TLR is completely dif ferent to that of antibodies or T cell receptors generating a binding domain against almos t any imaginable foreign structure (see section III.III). The expression of TLR is not static but modulated in response to pathogens, cytokines, or environmental exposure to microbial components [50]. TLR4 binds bacterial LPS and is the TLR investigate d in most detail. LPS is a component of the outer cell membrane of Gram-negati ve bacteria. The cell wall of a single Escherichia coli contains about two million LPS molecules. They are released General introduction and background 7 upon cell death and during growth and division. In humans LPS is able to provoke the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) potentially leading to multiple organ dysfunction. By contrast, its chronic exposur e to LPS in the environment of children has been associated with protection agains t the development of atopic diseases [35]. Binding of LPS occurs in close interaction of TLR a nd CD14 [51]. CD14 is a osome 5q [52]. Membrane CD14 (mCD14) mature myeloi d cells and is coexpressed and forms complexes with TLR4 and also TLR2 [53]. T wo soluble (sCD14) forms of CD14 are constitutively generated [54]. Beside LPS, CD14 recognizes a wide spectrum of microbial compounds [55], such as lipot eichoic , such as phospholipids [58-60]. It has been shown that expression of CD14 is corre lated with airway inflammation following inhalation of bacterial LPS [61]. The TLR2 subfamily is composed of TLR1, 2, 6 and 10 . This subgroup recognizes lipids of many different microorganisms. TLR1 and 6 act as co-receptors of TLR2 recognizing lipoproteins of bacteria, mycoplasma, a nd mycobacteria [62-64]. TLR2 alone recognizes various microbial compounds from G ram-positive bacteria and fungi, such as lipoteichoic acid, lipoarabinomannan , and glucans. The ligands of the other TLR consist of further vir al and bacterial compounds: Bacterial Tri-acyl lipopeptides (TLR 1), viral sing le and double stranded RNA (TLR 7/8 and TLR 3, respectively), bacterial flagellin ( TLR 5) and bacterial or viral CpG DNA (TLR 9). The ligands of TLR10 are unknown so fa r. TLR signalling pathway Activation of TLR by binding to one of its ligands triggers an intracellular signalling pathway involving recruiting Myeloid Differentiatio n primary-response protein 88 (MyD88) and translocation of Nuclear Factor B (NF-B,) to the nucleus leading to transcription and production of inflammatory mediat ors like Interferon (IFN) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) [42, 65]. Moreover, it has been shown that TLR activation induces antimicrobial effector mechanism s [66-68]. 8 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli Regulators of the TLR signaling cascade Activation of the TLR signaling cascade is absolute ly necessary to establish an immune response. But the process has to be tightly regulated, because misguided activation of the innate immune system may enhance the risk to develop chronic inflammation, allergy, and autoimmunity [69]. Repea ted challenge with LPS leads to a reduced responsiveness to a subsequent stimulatio n with LPS. This is a well- known phenomenon and is designated as endotoxin or LPS tolerance [70]. Many different molecules, e.g., the Suppressor Of Cytoki ne Signalling (SOCS) family, IL-1- Associated Kinase (IRAK) 2, and the Toll-Interactin g Protein (Tollip) have been proposed to be involved in negative regulation of t he TLR signaling cascade (reviewed in [71]). Regulation also occurs through down-regulation of transcription and translation of TLR genes or by degradation of T LR protein [72]. III.III The adaptive immune system Interaction between innate and adaptive immunity The components of both the innate and the adaptive immune system do not act independently. Activation of an innate immune syste m is a major prerequisite for activation of an adaptive immune response (reviewed in [73]). Recent studies further suggest that TLR on dendritic cells plays a crucial role in immune response by activation of T regulatory cells, which in turn may down-regulate TH2-type immune response [74]. Na\u00efve CD4+ T helper (Th) cell activa tion is initiated by interaction of the T Cell Receptor (TCR) - CD3 complex with a proc essed antigenic peptide bound to class II molecules presented on Antigen-Pres enting Cells (APC). The TCR dictates the antigen specificity of the response an d plays the central role in initiating T cell activation. T cell activation and differentiation Immature T cells migrate from bone marrow to the th ymus. There T cells begin to express the TCR for later antigen recognition. The TCR is a highly variable molecule attaining its diversity by combinatorial joining of variable-region gene segments generating a large number of random gene combinatio ns. Positive and negative selection then ensures survival of T cells able to recognize self (MHC restriction, positive selection), but elimination of cells expre ssing high-affinity receptors to self-General introduction and background 9 MHC molecules (negative selection) resulting in sel f-tolerance. These mature T cells migrate to the periphery, ready to get activated by APC. Depending on the density of the peptides presented, types of co-stimulatory mol ecules expressed and cytokines released by the APC, na\u00efve T helper cells start to proliferate and differentiate into the T effector cell subsets, Th-1, Th-2, production induces differentiation towards Th-1 cells. TheTh-1 respons e is characterized by the secretion of IL-2, Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)- , macrophages but inhibits Th-2 cells. Dysregulation of the Th-1 is associated with autoimmunity and inflam matory diseases. Th-2 cell differentiation, evolved to enhance clear ance of parasites, is induced by IL-4. Th-2 cells express transcription factor GATA- 3 enhancing the secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 [76]. These cytokines activate eosi nophils, mast cells, and mediate IgE secretion in B cells, but inhibit Th-1 cells. A dysregulated Th-2 response is associated with atopy. Treg cells act as suppressor for Th-1 and Th-2 cell s and are therefore important regulators of the immune response. The suppression depends, at least in part, on cell-to-cell contact [77]. Treg cells are character ized through expression of the transcription factor forkhead box (FOX) P3 and secr ete elevated amounts of the cytokines IL-10 and TGF- [78, 79]. Since these cells should not interfere w ith induction of pathogen-specific protective immune re sponse, TLR-mediated IL-6 production of APC the suppressive activity o f Treg cells [80]. Th-17 cells are induced through TGF- and IL-6 and produce high amounts of IL- 17. The development of Th-17 cells is blocked by IL -4 and IFN- and it seems that these cells have a function in suppressing autoimmu ne disease [81]. B cell activation B cells produce antibodies, a most effective tool o f the immune system to fight infections. B cells mature in the bone marrow. Duri ng maturation, the process of gene rearrangement of B cell receptors (equates to the membrane bound form of a antibody) takes place to generate antibodies with a vast diversity of binding specificities. Mechanistically, the process is very similar to the rearrangement of the 10 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli TCR genes. After maturation, B cells bearing the im munoglobulin (Ig, antibody) isotype M on the cell surface migrate to peripheral lymphoid organs, where they get activated through antigenic contact. Further signal s required for B cell activation come from the T helper cell, the interaction of CD4 0 on the B cell with CD40 ligand on the T helper cell and cytokines secreted by T he lper cells, respectively. After immunization with antigen, B cells proliferate for about a week. Then, they migrate to germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (lymp h nodes, spleen, and mucosal lymphoid tissues), where somatic and class-switch recombination (CSR) take place. Via somatic hypermutation, point mutations are induced in the variable region of the antibody gene to generate an tibodies with enhanced specificity. B cells bearing receptors with the highest affinity to the antigen are selected by affinity maturation. CSR exchanges the constant reg ion of the antibody, generally C \u00b5 (IgM) by C (IgG), C (IgA) or C (IgE) in order to change the antibodies' effector function. For induction of immunoglobulin class swi tching, two signals are required. The first CSR activation signal occurs (i) Th-depen dently by cell-to-cell contact (CD40 ligand - CD40 receptor on the B cell) or (ii) Th-independently (by BAFF, B lymphocyte stimulator protein, expressed by neutrop hils and macrophages). The second signal is provided by cytokines determining the isotype of the antibody (Th1 - IFN- - IgG2a/igG3; Th2 - IL-4 - IgE/IgG1). A necessary prerequisite for atopy is an elevated p roduction of IgE and hence CSR to IgE. Switching to IgE is under tight control of Th-2 cytokine IL-4 activating the transcription factor Signal Transducer And Activato r of Transcription (STAT) 6. Interestingly, a STAT6 haplotype was found to be as sociated with higher IgE levels [82]. Furthermore, recent work has shown that the p rotective effect of farm exposure might be switching stage and allergen specific and confined to Th-2-dependent IgG1, IgG4, and IgE expression [83]. The authors suggeste d that distinct mechanisms regulate individual steps within allergen-induced c lass switching. From IgE to Allergy Antigens that are inherently harmless but neverthel ess able to trigger an IgE- prone immune response are called allergens. The ato pic state is characterised by an exaggerated tendency to mount IgE responses to comm on environmental allergens. Plasma cells of atopic patients secrete IgE instead of IgG in response to allergens General introduction and background 11 and have therefore elevated serum levels of IgE [84 ]. IgE binds to Fc receptors on mast cells and basophils. These cells have granules containing pharmacologically active mediators. Cross-linking of IgE bound to Fc receptors by allergens leads to degranulation of the are released. The mediators are responsible for clinica l presentation of allergic asthma (mucosal inflammation, smooth-muscle (skin inflammation, pruritus [88]). IV Genetics The understanding that genetics play a role in alle rgic disease and asthma has been recognized for more than 100 years. This genet ic component was suggested through observations that allergic subjects had a s ignificantly higher incidence of family histories of disease as compared with contro ls [89]. Follow-up studies have shown that if one parent has allergies, a child has a 33% chance of developing allergies and if both parents are allergic that num ber jumps to a 70% chance. The results of twin studies suggest that approximately 50% of the risk for developing asthma is related to genetic factors with an equiva lent risk associated with environment [90]. IV.I Tools for studying genetics in atopic diseases With the introduction of new powerful genetic tools , the heritable component of atopic disease, in particular of asthma, has gained increasing attention over the last few years. With recent technological advances, the identification of alterations in the sequence of the base pairs of our DNA may help to u nderstand better the underlying biology and lead to the discovery of so far unknown processes resulting in atopic diseases. Genome-wide linkage studies rely on families with i ndividuals affected by asthma [91]. Evenly spaced genetic markers covering all ch romosomes are typed in family members, and a search is made for genetic regions c ontaining a higher than expected number of shared alleles among affected in dividuals within a family. The identification of such a region signals that somewh ere within this genomic interval, a 12 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli disease-predisposing allele is to be found. The genes within this region are further examined by positional cloning - that is, by typing denser and denser collections of genetic variants, until the underlying disease-associated gene(s) are found. Candidate-gene association studies focus on a selected number of genes that have been implicated as having a role in disease pathogenesis [91]. Association studies between variants in candidate genes and relevant phenotypes are mostly conducted by comparing allele or genotype frequencies between groups of unrelated cases and unrelated controls. Association analysis is expected to be more powerful for the detection of common disease alleles that confer modest disease risk in sample sizes that are comparable with those used in linkage studies [92]. Moreover, recruiting large numbers of unrelated affected individuals in association studies is easier than to collect large numbers of families, and there is increased statistical pow er in studying the equivalent number of individuals in a case-control association study than in family-based linkage studies. The innate immune system harbours several candidate s potentially playing a role in the development of atopic disease. One of them i s the CD14 cell surface protein Box 2. The nomenclature of single nucleotide polymorphisms. The nomenclature of genetic variants is still not standardized completely and is therefore occasionally confusing. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (S NPs), the variants most frequently assayed in genetic studies, are ideally defined by their position within the gene and the two alleles found at that position. However, the same SNP often receives different identifiers. For SNPs in regulatory regions, som e groups refer to the translation start site for numbering, whereas other groups count from the transcription start site. Thus, the same replacement of a C with a T in the CD14 promoter may be identified as CD14/C- 260T or CD14/C-159T. A solution to this pr oblem may be found through concerted efforts such as the one led by the SNP database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, which acts as a public- domain archive for a collection of genetic polymorphisms in various organisms [1] . dbSNP maps each submitted SNP assay to the genome and assigns to each submitted SNP assay an unambiguous ID (rs number) that corresponds to the position in an idealized genome. For example, the dbSNP notations of the CD14 polymorphism mentioned above is rs2569190. The strength of this system is that submitted SNPs that map to the same location are clustered into the same RefSNP and have th e same rs number. The SNPs discussed in this article are identified using traditional notation, which has the advantage of pointing readily to the gene, and by their rs number (at their first appearance in the text). General introduction and background 13 which is, as discussed, part of the receptor for ba cterial LPS. The C allele of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the n of ( CD14/C- 260T also known as CD14/C-159T ; rs2569190; see Box 2 for more information about the nomenclature of SNPs) has been linked to the pr esence of atopy in some, but not all [93-95] populations. Among the studies in suppo rt of a protective role of CD14/*-260T , Dutch adults homozygous for the C allele had a hi gher number of positive skin-test responses and higher total serum IgE levels (in individuals with positive skin-test responses) and subsequently more allergic symptoms [96]. Among 481 U.S. American children TT homozygotes had signi ficantly lower levels of IgE than did carriers of the other two genotypes [97]. In this publication TT homozygotes also had significantly higher sCD14 levels than did carriers of both the CC and CT genotypes, suggesting a functional role of the poly morphism in the production of sCD14. Likewise, atopic Chinese children homozygous for the C allele in CD14/C- 260T had the highest serum total IgE levels compared wi th those of subjects in the CT and TT subsets [98]. In a population-based cohor t followed from primary school age, it was found that the CC genotype in CD14/C-260T was associated with an increased risk of early onset atopy and bronchial h yperresponsiveness [99]. Almost equally impressive is the evidence against a n association between CD14/*-260T and protection from allergy. Thus the T allele of CD14/C-260T was associated with increased total serum IgE levels in allergic subjects who worked at the Jackson Laboratories [100]. The same allele was more often transmitted in Hutterites with positive skin-test responses [101] and more common among US patients with non-atopic asthma and food allergy th an among control subjects, particularly among white subjects [102]. Thus, ignoring the studies that did not observe at all an association between CD14/C-260T and the development of atopic diseases, the C alle le has evolved as both a risk and protective for allergic disorders. Considering that the studies discussed above have been conducted in different po pulations in their respective environments and that CD14/C-260T is only an example among many polymorphisms that have been described as both prot ective and risk factors, these conflicting results suggest that genes and environm ent are intertwined in complex, nonlinear relationships, such that the same genetic background might result in the expression of different phenotypes in different env ironments. 14 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli IV.II Inseparable friends: Genes and environment Gene-by-environment interactions have been defined as a situation when, because of their genetic differences, two or more i ndividuals, families or genotypic lines respond differently, or to different extents, to a change in the environment [103]. Most of the performed studies on gene-environment i nteractions are based on this principle. In contrast to population-based studies in which the average effect of an environmental exposure is compared between groups, the identification of susceptible individuals within populations via geno typing allows a better estimation of the true magnitude of effect of an environmental ex posure for the population at risk. Conversely, the function of a genetic variant may a lso be amenable to modification through environmental exposures. On the statistical level, an interaction in either direction typically refers to the effects of product terms or to heterogeneity of its main effects. In other words, the difference of a genetic effect between two strata - exposed and non-exposed individuals - is investigated. Conversely, the diff erence of an environmental effect between two strata of genetic make-up is also studi ed. To examine the interaction between genotype and environmental exposure on asth ma risk, two general approaches have been used that parallel the approac hes taken for identifying asthma-susceptibility genes in general. The first i s a genome-wide approach, in which exposure status is incorporated into a genome -wide screen for asthma-related traits to identify loci that contribute to asthma r isk in exposed cases only, and those that contribute to asthma risk in unexposed cases o nly. The second is a candidate gene approach in which genes are selected because o f their association with asthma-related traits and with biological pathways involved in the metabolism of environmental exposures. The genome-wide approach h as the potential to identify novel loci interacting with environmental exposures , whereas the candidate approach tests the contribution of biological pathways poten tially interacting with the environmental exposures under the assumption that t he polymorphisms significantly alter the function of the gene. The innate immune system offers several candidate g enes for investigation of gene-environment interaction in atopic diseases, si nce it serves, on the one hand, as a primary recognition system of environmental, part icularly microbial, exposure, and, on the other hand, owns the ability to initiate imm unological processes potentially General introduction and background 15 preventing atopic disease. In a sub-sample of the A LEX study population, it has been reported that a SNP in the gene encoding TLR2 ( TLR2/A-16934T ; rs4696480) significantly interacts with a farming environment [104]. Only farmers' children with a T allele were susceptible to protective factors on the farm, whereas children homozygote for the A allele had prevalences of asth ma and atopy comparable with those of non-farmers' children. Among non-farmers' children, no effect of TLR2 polymorphisms was seen. In the same population chil dren with the CC genotype of the aforementioned CD14/C-260T SNP had lower levels of specific IgE to common aeroallergens than the children with the CT or the TT genotype, but only when exposed to high LPS loads [105]. Likewise, being ho mozygotes for the CC allele was a risk factor in terms of total IgE and specific Ig E to inhalant allergens in children exposed to pets, but was a beneficial factor in chi ldren having regular contact with stable animals. Other gene-environment interactions for the CD14 gene have recently been published [106-109]. IV.III Functionality of genetic polymorphisms Regardless of the method used to discover genes tha t potentially modify disease susceptibility, a causative role for such genes can only be established through further functional characterization of the genes and their variants. For example, a SNP in the promoter of the IL-13 gen e ( IL13/C-1112T ; rs1800925), a key cytokine in asthmatic airway infl ammation, enhanced IL-13 promoter activity in primary human and murine CD41 TH2 lymphocytes, whereas the cts in non-polarized CD41 T cells [110]. The nuclear milieu may thus determine the functional outcome of a genetic variation. The nuclear milieu in turn may b e affected by the extracellular environment that will eventually be modified by a s ubject's environmental exposures. In the first description of CD14/C-260T polymorphism not only a negative association with the TT genotype and total IgE leve ls was shown, but the children with two T alleles also expressed higher levels of sCD14 [97]. Later work described that the relative transcriptional activities of the C and T alleles of CD14/C-260T differ in monocytes and hepatocytes, depending on the rati o between SP1 and SP3, which are the transcription factors that bind the polymor phic promoter region [111]. Recently, the same author described in a pediatric population an age-dependent 16 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli transcriptional activity of the genotypes of CD14/C-260T and CD14A-1721G , the latter being discussed in Chapter 5. There we show that the gene-environment interaction is not only observable for the health o utcomes under study, but also on the level of the gene expression of CD14. V Objectives of the Thesis Overall goal The overall goal of this thesis was to assess facto rs of the farming environment that influence the innate immune system with respect to gene expression of crucial proteins of innate immunity pathways and test if th is association is modulated by unknown genetic factors. We expected that results m ight give a deeper understanding of the immunological pathways and the complex relationship between environment, genes and atopic disease. In particular, the following research questions wer e addressed: Environmental factors and expression of innate immu nity genes 1. Can the results of the ALEX study [50] be confir med in the PARSIFAL data? Reproduction of results in different populations st rengthens the evidence that the measured effect is true. We address this question o f reproducibility in Chapter 2. 2. Are the levels of microbial compounds in house d ust associated with the expression of genes of the innate immune system? 3. Is the protective effect of farm milk consumptio n that has been shown in the ALEX study reproducible in the PARSIFAL study and is it at least partly explained by differential gene expression of PRR? 4. Which other specific factors of farming lifestyl e have an impact on the expression of PRR of the innate immune system? General introduction and background 17 5. Is there a window of age where potential benefic ial factors take effect? In PARSIFAL detailed information about timing and f requency of farm related exposures including farm milk consumption was asked and in a subsample house dust was collected. In Chapter 2 we investigate the association between distinct farm exposures, including exposure to microbial compound s, and gene expression of PRR. We can show that prenatal exposures to farming environment influence the expression of innate immunity genes and confer prot ection against atopic sensitisation in the unborn child. The exploration of the beneficial effect of farm milk consumption on atopic diseases is presented in Chap ter 3. But we could also show that not all farming environments protect against a topic diseases as outlined in Chapter 4. DNA polymorphisms, gene expression of PRR and envir onmental factors 6. To what extent do polymorphisms of genes encodin g for PRR modify the respective expression of PRR? 7. Does such a relation depend on environmental fac tors (gene-environment interaction) most notably the factors known to be p rotective regarding atopic diseases? In a sub-sample of PARSIFAL genetical analyses were done. DNA of peripheral blood leucocytes was genotyped for SNPs of the PRR to investigate gene expression among genotypes and gene-environment interactions. We present the results of these analyses in Chapter 5 of this thesis. Gene expression in the epidemiological study settin g 8. Are there qualitative differences of the gene ex pression results between the PARSIFAL and the ALEX study using different methodo logical approaches to some extent? 9. Which pitfalls have to be accounted for when doi ng gene expression measurements in epidemiological studies? 18 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli Gene expression measurements are a new tool to coll ect biological data in epidemiological studies. Circumstances (logistics, different laboratory staff and field workers) in which blood samples are handled differ in a large extent compared to the laboratory or clinical research. In Chapter 6 we th erefore investigated potential pitfalls regarding gene expression measurements in epidemiol ogical studies and were able to formulate recommendations for further projects. VI Methods: The PARSIFAL study Based on the previous findings of ALEX and other fa rm studies research teams of five European countries designed the cross-sectiona l PARSIFAL (Prevention of Allergy Risk factors for Sensitization In children related to Farming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle) study to further investig ate the protective effect of a farming lifestyle on atopic diseases. In addition t o the three alpine countries participating in ALEX (Austria, Germany and Switzer land) research teams from the Netherlands and Sweden joined the PARSIFAL study gr oup. The expansion of the number of participating study centres and efforts o f the respective research teams resulted in a large study population providing enou gh power for a closer investigation of potential protective factors of a farming lifest yle. As apparent in the acronym PARSIFAL investigation of an anthroposophic lifesty le and its influence on the development of atopic disease was a further goal of this study, since several publications reported lower prevalence of atopic di seases among children raised in anthroposophic families. However, this additional r esearch question is beyond the scope of this thesis. The PARSIFAL population consisted of 14893 children aged 5-13 years belonging to four study groups: farmer's children, children a ttending Steiner schools and their corresponding reference groups [112]. The parents c ompleted a detailed questionnaire, which included questions on environm ental exposures, lifestyle, socio- economic conditions, history of infections, diet, c ontact with animals, and on symptoms of bronchial asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis a nd atopic eczema. The questions were based on the internationally validated and tra nslated ISAAC phase-II questions [113] and the Swedish BAMSE study [114]. The questi onnaires were distributed and collected from October 2000 to May 2002. General introduction and background 19 Allergen-specific IgE In all countries a sub-sample of the children whose parents had consented were invited to blood sampling and a clinical examinatio n. Allergen-specific IgE was measured in 4049 children against a mix of common i nhalant allergens (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. and Cladosporium herbarum) and a mix of commo n food allergens (hen's egg white, codfish, cow's milk, peanut, soy bean and wh eat flour). Environmental microbial exposure LPS and fungal extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) w ere measured in mattress dust samples of 83.9% of children with complete gen e expression data (n=270). Sampling and detection methods are described elsewh ere [115]. In brief, LPS was measured with the kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amebo cyte Lysate test (Bio Whittaker, Walkersville, EPS with a specifi c sandwich enzyme immunoassay for EPS of Aspergillus and Penicillium species [116 ]. Gene expression measurements For the Swiss branch of the PARSIFAL study, RNA sam ples were collected from 195 farm and 127 reference children (95.3% of child ren who provided blood samples) to analyze gene expression of innate immunity recep tors. The total RNA was isolated with the QIAmp RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) was perfo rmed, as described elsewhere [117]. In brief, primers and probes were designed b y using the primer design software Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). Optim al concentrations for primers and probes were determined according to the manufac turer's instructions. The reactions for the target and the endogenous control were performed in separate tubes. All PCR reactions were analyzed on an ABI Pr ism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Experiments assessing background signals were performed for every assay by running the reaction w ithout templates (''no template controls''). No amplification was observed in any o f these ''no template controls,'' indicating that there was neither contamination nor unspecific. The data are 20 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli presented as normalized values (the amount of mRNA of the target molecule divided by the amount of mRNA of the endogenous control [18 s rRNA]). Genotyping of genes of the innate immune system Genotyping was done in 1478 PARIFAL children. To re produce our results in an independent sample we also analysed genetic data of 576 children of the ALEX study. Parental consent for genetic analyses was av ailable for all these children. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLCs) by using standard techniques. All genes were screened for single nucl eotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in white subjects. Haplotype tagging SNPs closely link ed with known polymorphisms (R2 > 0.7) and with a minor allele frequency of gre ater than 10% were chosen for this study by using the algorithm implemented in ldSelec t [118]. This algorithm is based on linkage disequilibrium. Genotyping for both popu lations was done in the same laboratory by using identical methods. Genomic DNA was assayed by using the 5' exonuclease reaction (Taqman, Applied Biosystems).

Objective: We sought to investigate the role of maternalexposures to environments rich in microbial compounds forthe development of atopic sensitization, asthma, and corresponding alterations in the innate immune system in offspring.Methods: In the children of the cross-sectional Prevention of Allergy Risk Factors for Sensitization in Children Related toFarming and Anthroposophic Life Style study, asthma and atopy were assessed by means of standardized questionnaires (n58263) and serum IgE measurements (n 52086). In a subsample (n 5322) gene expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4) and CD14 was assessed. Maternal exposures were dened through questionnaire information. Results: Both atopic sensitization (adjusted odds ratio, 0.58;95% CI, 0.39-0.86) and the gene expression of receptors ofinnate immunity were strongly determined by maternal exposure to stables during pregnancy, whereas current exposures had much weaker or no effects. A dose-responserelation was found between the extent of upregulation of these genes and the number of different farm animal species the mother had encountered in her pregnancy. Each additionalfarm animal species increased the expression of TLR2,TLR4, and CD14 by a factor of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.07-1.26), 1.12 (95% CI, 1.04-1.2), and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.03-1.23), respectively.Conclusion: Maternal exposure to an environment rich inmicrobial compounds might protect against the development of atopic sensitization and lead to upregulation of receptors of the innate immune system. The underlying mechanisms potentiallyoperating through the intrauterine milieu or epigenetic inheritance await further elucidation. Clinical implications: When assessing risk factors of allergies inan infant's medical history, attention must also be paid toenvironmental exposures affecting the mother.

Active smoking during pregnancy6; exposure of the pregnant mother to antibiotics,7paraceta- mol,8and allergens9,10; and the effect of such exposure on the fetus have been investigated in some detail. Still, little is known about the effects of maternal exposure to micro-bial compounds in the environment on the development of atopy and asthma in offspring. A deviated humoral immune response resulting in the production of IgE rather than IgG antibodies is thecommon feature of atopic diseases. The regulation of the humoral response by B cells depends on T effector cells. In turn, T-cell function is regulated by mediators of the innateimmune system. Although it has been shown that adaptive immune responses can be shaped in utero , 11little is known about potential prenatal determinants of the innate im-mune response and its relation to the development of atopy and asthma. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of exposures of the mother and the child, respectively, to environments rich in microbial burden for the develop- ment of atopy and asthma, as well as the gene expression ofreceptors of the innate immune response in the offspring. METHODS Population and study areas The cross-sectional Prevention of Allergy Risk Factors for Sensitization in Children Related to Farming and Anthroposophic Life Style (PARSIFAL) study aimed at studying the determinants ofchildhood asthma and allergies in farming and anthroposophic popu- lations, as described previously. 12A child who lived on a farm and whose family ran the farm was considered a farm child . Other chil- dren were termed farm reference children . The present analyses focus on 2823 farm and 5440 farm reference children aged 5 to 13 years from rural areas of Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. In Sweden farmers with children were identiedfrom the Farming Registry at the National Bureau of Statistics, andfarm reference children were randomly selected from the population registry among children living in the same area. In Austria all farm children of a given school class were chosen by teachers who hada good knowledge of the region, and reference children were randomly selected from the same schools by the local study group. In the other countries children were randomly selected from schools in areasknown to have a high percentage of farmers. The study was approved by the ethical boards of the 5 study centers, and written informed consent was obtained from thechildren's parents or guardians for questionnaires, blood sampling, and genetic analyses. Questionnaires The questionnaire comprised questions on sociodemographic background, parents' atopic diseases, family, and housing character-istics. In addition, information on the child's farm activities, as wellas the mother's farm exposures during pregnancy, were available. Questions related to the child's contact with different farm animals (during the rst year of life or later), consumption of farm milk(during the rst year of life or current), and regular stable or barn visits and helping with haying at present. Activities occurring at least weekly were dened as occurring regularly. Maternal exposureincluded contact to different farm animal species during pregnancyand regularly working in stables (sheep shelters, hog, cow, and chicken houses) during pregnancy and lactation. The questionnaire asked for contact with 6 different farm animal species (cows, pigs,sheep, horses, goats, and poultry), and these were summed. Questions on health outcomes and farm exposures were derived from the internationally validated International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood II 13questionnaire and the Allergy and Endotoxin study,14respectively. Children were considered to have current rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms if sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and itchy eyes were reported in the last 12 months without thechild having a cold at the same time. Current wheezing was dened asat least one episode of wheezing during the last 12 months. Children reported to have had symptoms of seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis in the last 12 months were dened as symptomatic, whereas children with areport of a physician's diagnosis of hay fever were considered to havea physician's diagnosis of seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis. Children with a report of a physician's diagnosis of asthma or of obstructive bron- chitis more than once in their lifetime were considered to have aphysician's diagnosis of asthma. Measurement of allergen-specic serum IgE levels In Austria, the Netherlands, and Sweden all children whose parents had consented to blood sampling were invited to a physical examination with blood sampling. In Germany and Switzerland onlya random sample of those who consented were invited because of thecomparatively large number of children included in these countries. 12 This subsample of children with blood analysis (n 52086) did not signicantly differ from the whole sample in regard to disease fre-quencies or family history of atopic disease (data not shown). Allergen-specic IgE for common and CAP serum. Two cut-off values foratopic sensitization were used: IgE values of 0.35 kU/L or greater and 3.5 kU/L or greater for either inhalant or food allergens. Expression of Toll-like receptors For the Swiss branch of the PARSIFAL study, RNA samples were collected from 195 farm and 127 reference children (95.3% ofchildren who provided blood samples) to analyze gene expression of innate immunity receptors. Children with available RNA samples did not differ signicantly from the total Swiss PARSIFAL popula-tion with respect to farm exposures and health outcomes (data notshown). The total RNA was isolated with the QIAmp RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Foster Calif) was performed, as described elsewhere. 15In brief, primers and probes were designed by using the primer design software Primer Express (Applied Biosystems).J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL APRIL 2006818 Ege et al Environmental and occupational respiratory disordersOptimal concentrations for primers and probes were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reactions for the target and the endogenous control were performed in separate tubes. All PCR reactions were analyzed on an ABI Prism 7700Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Experimentsassessing background signals were performed for every assay by running the reaction without templates (''no template controls''). No amplication was observed in any of these ''no template con-trols,'' indicating that there was neither contamination nor un- specic fluorescence (see Fig E1 in the Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). The data are presented as normalized values (the amount of mRNA of the target molecule divided by the amountof mRNA of the endogenous control [18s rRNA]). Endotoxin and fungal extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) were measured in mattress dust samples of 83.9% of children withcomplete gene expression data (n 5270). Sampling and detection methods are described elsewhere. 16In brief, endotoxin was measured with the kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate test (Bio Whittaker, Walkersville, Md) and with a specic sandwichenzyme immunoassay for EPS of Aspergillus and Penicillium species. 17 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed with SAS 9.1.3 (The SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Stata/SE 8.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex) software. Odds ratios (ORs) or geometric means ratios and 95% CIs were calculated in multiple logistic regression analysis. In preliminary logistic analyses the associations of atopic sensi- tization, atopic symptoms, or diseases and exposure to farm charac- teristics were explored and adjusted for predened covariates (age, sex, parental education, maternal and paternal atopy, number ofolder siblings, exposure to pets, and study center). We included farmcharacteristics that best predicted being a farm child, namely the child's current exposure to a farming lifestyle (regular stable or barn visits or helping with haying), the child's exposure to farm animals(ever), predominant consumption of farm milk (ever), and regular maternal work in stables during pregnancy. In the nal regression model all variables were mutually adjusted. The independent effectsof maternal work in stables during pregnancy and lactation wereinvestigated to evaluate the effect of timing of the exposure. Because the distribution of gene expression levels of the CD14, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, and TLR4 genes was skewed, thesevariables were log-transformed, resulting in a good approximation tothe normal distribution (data not shown). For farm and farm reference children, these log-transformed values were compared by using the ttest, and crude geometric means with their 95% CIs were computed. Multiple regression models adjusting for the same covariates asmentioned above were used to explore the associations between gene expressions and farm-related exposure measures. Results were expressed as adjusted geometric means ratios. In addition, adjustedgeometric means of normalized gene expression were calculated for different levels of specic exposure variables (eg, the number of farm animal species the mother was exposed to during pregnancy). In further analyses the effect of additional exposures during intervening years (5-13 years) that might influence atopic sensitiza- tion or gene expression were tested. In turn, the following variables were included in the regression models: worm infestations ever,respiratory infections during the rst 2 years of life, day-careattendance, prescription of antibiotics or antipyretics before or after the rst year of life, and history of measles, rubella, mumps, pertussis, or mononucleosis.RESULTS Of the 11,969 invited farm and farm reference children, 8402 (70%) returned the questionnaires. A total of 139 children were excluded because of missing values for sexand age or because they did not meet the age criteria of5 to 13 years. The prevalence of all outcomes (atopic sensitization, rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and physician's diagnosisof seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis, and current wheezing and physician's diagnosis of asthma) was signicantly lower in farm children compared with in nonfarm children (seeFig E2 in the Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ), 12 despite some heterogeneity across the countries. The most pronounced differences between farm and nonfarm chil-dren were seen in Germany. Factors mediating the farm effect Determinants of the protective farm effect were assessed in multiple regression models ( Table I ). Predom- inant farm milk consumption was inversely related to P5.079) and ( P5.038), and wheezing (P5.065). Additionally, regular contact with farm ani- mals contributed to the protective effect on the physician'sdiagnosis of seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis ( P5.049). Rhi- noconjunctivitis symptoms in the last 12 months were also inversely related to frequent stable or barn visits or helpwith haying ( P5.007). The strongest protective effect, however, was found for maternal stable work during preg- nancy on atopic sensitization (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.86; P5.007). Moreover, this association remained signicant after additional adjustment for being a farm child or correction for multiple testing ( P Bonferroni 5.035). Maternal stable exposure during pregnancy versus lactation Because 20% of all mothers working in the stable during pregnancy (n 52184) stopped working in the stable after giving birth to the child, it was possible to disentangle the contributions of pregnancy and lactation, respectively, to the maternal effect. The effect of maternal stable workduring lactation tended to be less pronounced (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.96). It was no longer statistically signif- icant when adjusted for maternal exposure in pregnancy(OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.52-1.61). When assessing theeffect of timing of rst exposure to farm animals on atopic sensitization, adjusted ORs for rst contact in pregnancy, rst contact in rst year of life, rst contactbetween rst year and current, and current rst contact were 0.36 (95% CI, 0.25-0.51), of the effect on atopic sensitization across countries We furthermore assessed the effect of maternal stable work during pregnancy on atopic sensitization for eachJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 117, NUMBER 4Ege et al 819 Environmental and occupational respiratory disorderscountry separately ( Fig 1 ). The protective maternal effect was found in all countries but Sweden (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.50-4.01). We investigated different cut-off denitions in the 4 countries showing a protective maternal effect.Using the detection limit as cut-off ( /C210.35 kU/L) yielded a somewhat weaker but still signicant effect (OR, 0.73; (95% CI, 0.54-0.995) compared with greater (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35-0.80). Association of farm-related exposure with gene expression Because environmental factors have been shown to correlate with the expression of receptors of the innateimmune system, we next investigated the expression of the genes for TLR2, TLR4, and CD14 in the Swiss subpopulation. Geometric means of the expression ofthese genes were signicantly higher among farm children than among farm reference children (TLR2: 0.74 thereby conrmingprevious data from another farming population. 18It was, however, not the current exposure to several farm charac-teristics but rather maternal exposure during pregnancythat was associated with increased gene expression (Table II ). Likewise, current levels of endotoxin and EPS in mattress dust were not correlated with gene expres-sion of their respective receptors (data not shown and Fig E3 in the Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). Day-care attendance, reported childhood infections,worm infestation, and use of antibiotics or antipyretics during intervening years were not associated with gene expression of TLR/CD14 and atopy and did not affectreported point estimates. However, a dose-response rela- tion was found when relating the number of different farm animal species the mother had contact with duringpregnancy to gene expression ( Fig 2 ). Each additional species of farm animal the mother was exposed to during pregnancy increased the expression of TLR2, TLR4, and CD14 by a factor of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.07-1.26), 1.11 (95% CI, 1.03-1.19), and 1.14 (95% CI, 1.04- 1.24), respectively. Neither restricting the analysis to farm children only nor omitting the highest category of contactto farm animal species during pregnancy materially changed the results. In a model including exposure to different animal species during pregnancy and during therst year of life simultaneously, stronger effects wereobserved for exposure during pregnancy (TLR2, 1.11 [95% between these 2 variableswas moderate ( r50.69).

Maternalexposure to stables in pregnancy was associated withatopic sensitization and the expression of genes for recep- tors of the innate immune system (ie, TLR2, TLR4, and CD14). A dose-response relation was found between theextent of the upregulation of these genes and the number of different farm animal species the mother had contact with during her pregnancy. However, only longitudinal studieswill eventually establish a causal relationship. The identication of farm milk and stable animal contact as being protective for asthma and seasonalrhinoconjunctivitis is in accordance with the results ofthe Allergy and Endotoxin study. 14The much larger size of the PARSIFAL population allowed, however, a more detailed investigation of the relevant time windows ofexposure for each outcome. A stronger effect of prenatal (ie, maternal) exposure was seen for atopic sensitization. Moreover, this effect was observed for gene expressionof innate immunity receptors. Stable exposure during pregnancy was more relevant than exposure while the mother was breast-feeding, thereby shifting the focus toprenatal exposure. The cross-sectional design of the study might have resulted in recall bias. However, this isunlikely because the outcomes (IgE levels and gene ex- pression) were laboratory parameters not known to themothers when answering the questionnaires. The maternaleffect was independent of the mother's history of atopy and consistent over geographic areas, with the exception of Sweden. In Sweden none of the stables were connectedto farmhouses in contrast to the other countries, potentially indicating a different pattern and intensity of exposure. Moreover, the levels of microbial compounds in housedust differ between Sweden and the other countries. 16 Exposure to farm animals and stables has been found to be associated with increased exposure to various micro-bial products. 19,20TLR2 is a receptor for various micro- bial compounds from gram-positive bacteria and fungi, such as gram-negative bacteria. CD14 in turn is involved in the recognition of LPSs and other bacterial wall compo- nents. 21It seems therefore likely that the upregulation of these genes with an increasing number of farm animal species the mother was exposed to during pregnancy is attributable to increasing levels, diversied levels, orboth of microbial exposure associated with contact with these animals.TABLE II.

The innateimmune response communicates with the effector cells of the adaptive immune response, which includes the T helper cell populations. 22TH1 cells favor the production of IgG antibodies, whereas T H2 cells promote the production of IgE antibodies and thereby the development of atopic diseases. In experimental studies it has been shown thatstimulation of the innate immune response might skew the balance toward antiallergic T H1 responses.23,24How- ever, in children of farming environments with high endo-toxin exposure, a decreased secretion of both T H1 and T H2 cytokines was observed on restimulation of leukocytes through the TLR4 ligand LPS.25This nding suggests that mechanisms other than a T H1/T H2 imbalance might be operational in these environments. T regulatory cells or mechanisms inherent to innate immune signaling, such as LPS tolerance, might play a role.18,26,27 In the present study current exposures to either stables and barns or to measured levels of microbial products indoors were not related to expression of these innateimmunity genes. Yet other microbial exposures than theones assessed might have been of greater importance. However, endotoxin and EPS are specic ligands for TLR4 and TLR2, respectively, 21which makes it improb- able that we have missed major environmental signals. In contrast, maternal contact with increasing numbers of farm animal species, which is likely to parallel micro-bial exposures, was signicantly related to a long-lasting upregulation of the expression of these innate immunity genes, which was still detectable at school age. Similarly,maternal work in stables during pregnancy was associated with decreased production of allergen-specic IgE anti- bodies, which was again detectable at school age. Thusprenatal environmental influences might affect thelong-term development of innate and adaptive immune responses. In turn, the manifestation of organ-specic atopic conditions of the upper and lower respiratory tractmight depend on the interplay between the growing and maturing child and his or her environment. It is unknown how the maternal environment exerts its effect on the offspring. One might speculate that the fetal immune system interacts with a certain cytokine pattern prevailing in the maternal organism 28or with the antigens themselves,29implying the establishment of immunologic tolerance. Another attracting explanation might consist in epigenetic inheritance. Differential patterns of geneexpression arise during development in utero and are sub- sequently retained through mitosis. Stable alterations are heritable but do not involve mutations of the DNA it- self. 30,31Recent data suggest that environmental factors might alter methylation processes, a key element of epige- netic inheritance.30Furthermore, there is some evidence suggesting that endotoxin has a role in gene silencingbecause LPS is a potent inflammogen that stimulates acetylation of histones. 32 The PARSIFAL study does not provide information on the maternal exposure before pregnancy, and therefore wecannot exclude a preconceptional effect. In other words,the mother's earlier exposure to a farming environment might have determined a conguration of her immunesystem, which she then passed on to her child. If indeed preconceptional exposures were important, environmental determinants of disease inception would also operate inthe parental generation. Recent observations demonstrat- ing a plateau of the prevalences of asthma, seasonal rhino- conjunctivitis, and atopic sensitization after 3 decades, 33-35 which approximates a generation, might indirectly support the notion of a generational effect. Furthermore, a transge- nerational association of a grandmother's smoking withher grandchildren's risk for asthma has recently been re-ported. 36Of note, in our rural population the effect of maternal work in stables during pregnancy on the child's atopy risk was independent from the mother's smokinghabits. The lack of insight into the determinants of the in- crease in the prevalence of asthma and allergies over time might therefore in part be explained by the neglect of thepotential effect of preconceptional exposures of the parents. In conclusion, our results suggest that maternal exposures to environments rich in microbial exposuresdetermine the priming of a child's immune response. For organ-specic manifestation of allergic diseases, addi- tional factors, continuing exposure, or both effective laterin life seem to be important. Our ndings stress the importance of the identication of the appropriate time window leading to the modulation of immune responsesand disease manifestation, respectively. Longitudinal studies will eventually deepen our understanding of the relevant temporal sequences.

E-mail: Marco.Waser@unibas.chSummary Background Dietary interventions as a means for atopy prevention attract great interest. Some studies in rural environments claimed an inverse association between consumption of farm-produced dairy products and the prevalence of allergic diseases, but current evidence iscontroversial.Objective To investigate whether consumption of farm-produced products is associated with a lower prevalence of asthma and allergy when compared with shop-purchased products.Methods Cross sectional multi-centre study (PARSIFAL) including 14 893 children aged 5-13 years from ve European countries (2823 from farm families and 4606 attending Steiner Schools as well as 5440 farm reference and 2024 Steiner reference children). A detailed questionnaire including a dietary component was completed and allergen-specic IgE wasmeasured in serum.Results Farm milk consumption ever in life showed a statistically signicant inverse association with asthma: aOR 0.50 (95% CI 0.28-0.87). The associations were observed in all four subpopulations and independent of farm-related co-exposures. Other farm-produced products were not independently related to any allergy-related healthoutcome.Conclusion Our results indicate that consumption of farm milk may offer protection against asthma and allergy. A deepened understanding of the relevant protective components of farmmilk and a better insight into the biological mechanisms underlying this association arewarranted as a basis for the development of a safe product for prevention.

It has been postulated thatthe decrease in vegetable consumption and a shift fromanimal to vegetable fats has contributed to the increase inasthma and allergic diseases over the last decades [1, 2].Several studies reported positive associations between elevated margarine consumption and childhood atopy risk [3, 4], while studies in rural environments reported aninverse association between consumption of farm-pro-duced dairy products such as yogurt and farm milk andthe prevalence of atopy aFinnish study among farm and non-farm children, no effectof dairy product consumption and atopy was observed, but regular intake of fresh vegetables, predominantly when grown in the own garden, signicantly reduced the risk ofatopic sensitization [10]. Thus, current evidence of therelation between farm-produced products and the preva-lence of allergic disease is controversial and mechanismsunderlying the observed associations are unknown. Experi-ments demonstrating a benecial effect of adding apatho-genic bacteria (probiotics) to children's diet as a means atopic dermatitis have [11, 12], however, stimu- lated the interest in a possible role of microbes associatedwith the consumption of farm-produced foods. The large European PARSIFAL study (Prevention of allergy risk factors for sensitization in children related tofarming and anthroposophic lifestyle) offered the oppor-tunity to examine specically the relation between self- orfarm-produced products and the prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases in more than 14 000 school-aged children [13]. The study included farm children, children fromRudolf Steiner schools (families with an anthroposophiclifestyle), and reference children from rural and sub-urbanareas. The anthroposophic lifestyle includes factors like arestrictive use of antibiotics, antipyretics, and vaccina-tions, and often a biodynamic diet. An earlier studyconducted in an anthroposophic community in Sweden showed a lower prevalence of childhood allergy [14]. The present analyses of the PARSIFAL study specically addressed the question of whether, rst, consumption ofself- or farm-produced products, especially farm milk isassociated with a lower prevalence of asthma, allergicdiseases, and atopic sensitization when compared withshop-purchased products, and second, whether theseassociations are limited to children from rural environ- ments or explained by other concurrent farm exposures. MethodsStudy population Within the PARSIFAL study, children aged 5-13 years, from farm families or attending Rudolf Steiner schools,were compared with children from rural non-farming environments (reference for the farm children) and withchildren from (sub)urban environments attending State schools (reference for the Steiner school children) in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzer-land. Children in Steiner schools often come from familieswith an anthroposophic lifestyle, which includes a holisticapproach to life, education, and medicine. The details ofthe study design are described elsewhere [13]. In brief, atotal of 15137 (70% participation rate) parents' completedquestionnaires were collected. Two hundred and forty- four questionnaires were excluded because children were outside the age limits or main information was missing,leaving 14 893 children for the analyses. In all, 8788children gave consent for blood sampling and of these4854 were invited for blood sampling [all children fromAustria (806), the Netherlands (691), and Sweden (944)and a random sample of children from Germany (1548)and Switzerland (865) due to the comparatively large number of recruited children]. Four thousand and forty- nine (83.4%) children provided a blood sample and 3979samples yielded a sufcient volume for allergen-specicIgE measurements. The study was approved by localresearch ethics committees in each country and informedconsent was obtained from the parents of each child. Parents' questionnaire The dietary component of the PARSIFAL questionnaire included questions on the frequency of current average consumption of self-produced or directly purchased on afarm- and store-purchased foods. These foods includedmilk, butter, and other dairy products as well as margar-ine, eggs, meat, vegetables, and fruits. Response optionswere restricted to four categories: never, less than once perweek, one to six times per week, or once a day or more. Validity and reproducibility were assessed with 24-h recalls performed as telephone interviews of 493 ran- domly selected participants from all involved studygroups and study areas. The validity for foods consumedwith high frequency such as milk, vegetables, and fruitswas the highest (positive predictive value above 60%, andnegative predictive value above 80%). The reproducibilityof reported consumption of milk during the rst year oflife was concordant among 71% of participants for store- purchased milk and 85% for farm-produced milk. No signicant differences were found in the validity ofresponses between the ve countries participating orbetween the four groups of children. Besides the dietary component, the parental question- naire included questions on socio-demographic back-ground, parents' atopic diseases, food avoidance due toallergies in the family, breastfeeding, and the child's height and weight. In addition, information on the child's farm activities as well as the mother's farm exposures during Journal compilation /C13c2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Clinical and Experimental Allergy , 37: 661-670 No claim to original US government works662 M. Waser et alpregnancy was available. A child who lived on a farm and whose family ran the farm was coded as being a farm child. The prevalence of diseases and symptoms were assessed by questions of the validated and translated International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) [15].Children ever diagnosed with asthma, or obstructive bron-chitis more than once, were considered to have a doctor'sdiagnosis of asthma. Current wheezing was dened ashaving wheezing at least once during the past 12 months.In a subsample of the PARSIFAL study questionnaire,responses on asthma and current wheeze have been validated against a bronchial challenge with hypertonic saline and no signicant differences in validity werefound between the four study groups [16]. Children diagnosed with hayfever and whoever had the symptoms of hayfever, were considered to have a doctor'sdiagnosis of rhinoconjunctivitis. Current rhinoconjuncti-vitis symptoms were dened as sneezing, runny nose,nasal block-up, and itchy eyes during the past 12 months, without having a cold at the same time. Children with an intermittent itchy rash lasting at least 6 months and who had been diagnosed with atopic/allergic eczema were considered to have eczema. Current atopic eczema symptomswas considered if the child had ever had an itchyrash intermittently for at least 6 months and, in addition,reported an itchy rash in dened locations (bend of the arm/knee, backside of thighs, neck, and around eyes/ears) at any time during the last 12 months. Allergen-specic immunoglobulin E measurements All samples were screened with a mix of common ) and a mix of common food allergens (fx5: egg white, milk, sh, wheat, peanut, soya bean) (Pharmacia CAP System; PharmaciaDiagnostics AB, Uppsala, mite) and Lepidoglyphus destructor (storage mite) , a mix of grass pollen, a mix of tree pollen, cat, and horseepithelium. All analyses were performed centrally at the Department of Clinical Immunology (Karolinska Univer- sity value 3.5 was also considered forthe analyses. Pollen sensitization was dened as positivegrass pollen mix and/or positive tree pollen mix. Statistics w 2Statistics were used to evaluate differences in dietary habits between farm children and farm reference childrenas well as between Steiner school children and their reference group. Consumption of products from self-production or directly purchased on a farm was compared with shop-purchased products. Logistic regression analyses were performed to calcu- late adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of the association betweenasthma or allergy outcomes and farm-produced foods.Multivariate models evaluating the effect of each fooditem on allergy outcomes were adjusted for predenedcovariates including study group (farm children, Steinerschool children, and the respective reference groups), country, sex, age, mother's and father's reported asthma and/or hayfever, parents' education, maternal smokingduring pregnancy, current environmental smoking athome, older siblings, exclusive breastfeeding 44m o n t h s , BMI, and food avoidance due to familial asthma and/orallergy. In a second step, models were mutually adjustedfor all food items. We also calculated stratied estimates for the four study groups. The degree of heterogeneity of the stratum- specic ORs across study groups was evaluated usingstandard meta-analytic techniques [17]. In models exam-ining the association between farm milk consumptionand health outcomes, the timing of consumption (onlyin the rst year of life, only at present, both in therst year of life, and at present), and relevant concomitantfarm exposures such as frequency of the child's cur- rent visits to animal sheds (less or more than once a week) were additionally tested. In a sensitivity analysis, wealso tested whether the effect of farm milk consump-tion varied across individual countries. Stability of effectestimates was examined by removing each country, one ata time. To assess the possible influence of allergy-related changes in dietary habits, the respective question was included in all regression models. For the nal analyses, we excluded the 469 non-milk-drinking children to avoidpotential primary milk avoidance due to allergy-relatedsymptoms at younger ages. Statistical analyses wereperformed using STATA (version 8.2, Stata Corp LP,College Station, TX, USA). Results Table 1 shows the distribution of children's consumption of selected farm-produced or shop-purchased foods across study groups. Although the consumption of farm milk andof self-produced products was most common among farmchildren, relevant proportions of all other study groupsalso ate and drank these products. Table 2 gives the results of the multivariate analyses evaluating the effect of each individual farm-producedfood on asthma and allergy adjusting for the predened covariates (left side ).

In addition, farm milk and egg consumption were inverselyrelated to diagnosed rhinoconjunctivitis.

Table 3 shows the association between farm milk con- sumption and sensitization to aero and food allergens,adjusted for predened covariates and all farm-produced foods. Using a cut-off level of 0.35 kU/L, a signicant inverse association was found for a sensitization to horseallergen, and associations for sensitization to pollen, catdander, and to the food mix fx5 tended to be negative,whereas the association with house dust and storage mitestended to be positive. When the more clinically relevantcut-off level of X3.5 kU/L was chosen, the negative association with farm milk consumption became stronger and statistically signicant for pollen sensitization and the food mix fx5. The inverse relation between farm milk consumption and the prevalence of diagnosed asthma, rhinoconjuncti-vitis, and pollen sensitization was observed in all four study groups without signicant heterogeneity (Fig. 1).Similarly, no signicant heterogeneity of the effectsacross for fx5 (p-heterogeneity0.610) and horse dander (p-heterogeneity 0.465). When the use of shop-purchased butter and the consumption of butter made out of farm milk wascontrasted to margarine consumption, an inverse associa-tion was seen between butter consumption and asthmaand wheeze even when simultaneously adjusted asso-ciations were observed for other allergy-related healthoutcomes. A strong and consistent inverse association was observed for the prevalence of asthma, wheeze, rhinoconjunctivitis(diagnosed and symptoms), pollen sensitization, and fx5 inchildren who consumed farm milk since their rst year of life (Table 4). The inclusion of other relevant concomitant farm activities in the multivariate regression model some-what attenuated the effects and widened the condenceintervals (CIs) (Table 4), but the estimated protective effectTable 1.

Other farm-produced foods were notindependently related to asthma and allergy prevalence.Of particular importance is the consistency of the ndingsacross children from farming, rural non-farming, anthro- posophic, and (sub)urban environments indicating that farm milk consumption represents a route of exposurethat is independent of concomitant exposures to microbialcompounds present in animal sheds and farm homes.

Waser et alinverse association was not explained by concurrent farm activities of the child or farm exposures during pregnancyand was most pronounced in children drinking farm milk since their rst year of life. The results of the PARSIFAL study thus conrm an inverse association between farm milk consumption andallergic health outcomes reported previously [5-9]. How-ever, the specic allergic health outcomes associated withfarm milk consumption differ between studies. The strongeffect on asthma was only reported by the ALEX study,which has been conducted in the same three alpine countries as the PARSIFAL study, but in geographically different and independent study populations [5]. Inverseassociations between farm milk consumption and allergicrhinoconjunctivitis have been reported by the ALEX study[5], a study in New Zealand [9], and a recent study in theUnited Kingdom [8]. The ALEX study and surveys con-ducted in Crete [7], Northern Germany [6], New Zealand[9], and the United Kingdom [8] reported an inverse association between farm milk consumption and atopy whereas the PARSIFAL study observed an inverse associa-tion with most tested allergens, but not mites. No associa-tion between farm milk consumption and atopicsensitization was reported by a study conducted amongrural children from Finland [10]. Allergen-specic differences in response to environ- mental exposures have already been reported by a series of farm studies that suggested a stronger association between farm residency and pollen sensitization and noor weak relations with mite sensitization [18-21]. How-ever, other farm studies did not conrm these ndings[8, 22, 23]. To evaluate whether the allergen-speciceffects associated with farm milk consumption in thePARSIFAL study represent so far unappreciated peculia-rities in the biology of allergen/immune system interac- tions deserves replication of these ndings and further investigations of potential mechanisms. The studies conducted in the United Kingdom and New Zealand reported strong and statistically signicant in-verse relations between farm or raw milk consumptionand atopic eczema that was not observed in the presentstudy. These contrasting ndings may in part be explainedby the amount of control for food avoidance that differed between the studies. Food avoidance due to a pre-existing allergy may bias the results in cross-sectional analyses.Eleven percent of the PARSIFAL population reportedavoiding certain foods due to an existing allergy in oneof the family members. Adjusting all regression modelsfor this variable only slightly attenuated the effect esti-mates of farm milk consumption on asthma or rhinocon-junctivitis. However, the association between farm milk consumption and diagnosed eczema became non-signi- cant when adjustment was made for food avoidance[diagnosed eczema without adjustment for food avoid-ance (aOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.95), and current eczemaTable 4.

When the study population was restricted to those withoutfood avoidance, no signicant association between farm milk observed. We alsoexcluded all non-milk-drinking children because thisgroup may have changed dietary habits due to allergy-related skin or gastrointestinal problems early in life andnot report it as deliberate food avoidance. However, thisrestriction had no strong impact on reported atopic dermatitis or any other allergic health outcome. At present, we can only speculate about the compo- nents of farm milk responsible for the observed protectiveeffect. Farm milk possibly contains different levels or adifferent composition of pathogenic and nonpathogenicmicrobes compared with milk purchased in a shop. Thehealth effects of pathogens in raw milk such as salmonellaor enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are well recognized, and transmission of EHEC through unpasteur- ized cow's milk continues to cause serious health effects[24]. It is conceivable that the microbial burden of farmmilk influences the gut microflora and thus the develop-ment of oral tolerance [25, 26]. Recent animal experi-ments that colonization of germ-free micewith polysaccharide-A-producing Bacteroides fragilis ,a ubiquitous gut microorganism and an important Gram- negative anaerobe that colonizes the mammalian lower gastrointestinal tract, restored normal cytokine produc-tion and established a proper T-helper type 1 (Th1)/Th2balance for the host [27]. Gut microflora may also regulateimmune responses outside the gut as has been evidencedin recent animal experiments. Mice were treated withantibiotics in drinking water, followed by a single orallavage of yeast ( C.albicans ) [28]. They of gastrointestinal in- creased yeast numbers in the gastrointestinal microbiota.Subsequent intranasal exposure to mould spores led to anallergic response in the airways that was not observedwhen exposure occurred without prior alteration of thegut microflora. These results indicate that events in distalmucosal sites may play an important role in regulatingimmune response in the airways. Commensal microorgan- isms present in farm milk might therefore be responsible for the decreased risk for respiratory allergies such asasthma and hayfever. The present study does not allow evaluating the effect of pasteurized vs. raw milk consumption because noobjective conrmation of the raw milk status of the farmmilk samples was available. Parental answers to a ques-tion on consumption of boiled vs. raw farm milk are likely to be biased due to the social desirability of responses because raw milk consumption is not recommendedespecially for young children. About half of the parentsindicated that they usually did not boil the milk beforeconsumption but no differential effects were observed between those boiling and those not boiling the milk. Thismight be a result of biased parental answers or may indicate that pasteurization is not of key importance because compounds other than microbes may play a role.This interpretation is supported by an analysis of Swissalpine farm milk from exclusively grass-fed cows showinga higher content of omega-3 fatty acids than milk fromcows fed conserved grass such as silage [29]. The relativeconcentrations of linolenic acid (18 : 3) and eicosapentae-noic acid (20 : 5) and the ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid to arachidonic acid (20 : 4) that is critical for the formation of omega-3-derived eicosanoids were signicantly higher inmilk from grass-fed cows and cheese made from thismilk [29, 30]. Research into fatty acid effects on allergicdiseases has focused on the intake of omega-3 fatty acidsthat is potentially benecial, and of omega-6 and trans-fatty acids which might be detrimental to asthma [31].Elevated margarine consumption, which contributes to the intake of omega-6 fatty acid and of trans-fatty acids has been reported to increase childhood atopy risk inseveral epidemiological studies [3, 32]. Other studiesindicated that full-fat milk and butter was associated witha reduced risk of asthma in young children [33-35]. In thepresent study, butter compared with margarine consump-tion was associated with a lower risk for asthma support-ing a possible role of fatty acid intake. Future analyses of the farm milk compounds responsible for the benecial effect therefore have to include fatty acid proles inaddition to microbial compounds. Several limitations of the study have to be taken into account. First, dietary assessment is based on a limited setof variables that do not provide a complete representationof the child's diet. However, the primary aim of the presentanalyses was to compare farm-produced vs. shop-pur- chased products and their effect on allergic diseases and not to evaluate the effect of diet per se. The validity andreproducibility of the present dietary assessment has beenshown to be good especially for farm milk consumption.Second, as no measurements of biological compounds offarm milk or other farm-produced products are available,the study reports associations and cannot provide aninsight into the mechanism underlying the observed association between farm milk consumption and allergic diseases. Third, as the underlying mechanism of the farmmilk effect is not known, the study does not allow toelucidate why consumption of farm milk is associatedwith different allergic health outcomes in different studypopulations. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that consumption of farm milk is associated with a lower risk of childhood asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis. These results might be transferred to non-farming populationsas they were observed in all subpopulations of thePARSIFAL study. Dietary interventions are an attractive Journal compilation /C13c2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Clinical and Experimental Allergy , 37: 661-670 No claim to original US government works668 M. Waser et almeans for primary prevention. However, raw milk may contain pathogens such as salmonella or EHEC, and itsconsumption may therefore imply serious health risks [24]. A deepened understanding of the relevant 'protec- tive' components of farm milk and a better insight into thebiological mechanisms underlying the reported epidemio-logical observation are warranted as a basis for thedevelopment of a safe product for prevention. At thisstage, consumption of raw farm milk cannot be recom-mended as a preventive measure.

Inconsistentdata on the relation of farming to asthma and wheeze have raised some doubt about a true protective effect. Objective: We sought to study the differential effects offarm-associated exposures on specic asthma-related health outcomes. Methods: The cross-sectional Prevention of Allergy RiskFactors for Sensitization in Children Related to Farming andAnthroposophic Lifestyle study included 8263 school-age children from rural areas in 5 European countries. Information on farm-related exposures and health outcomes was obtainedby using questionnaires. In subsamples allergen-specic IgEand RNA expression of CD14 and Toll-like receptor genes were measured, and dust from children's mattresses was evaluated for microbial components.Results: Inverse relations with a diagnosis of asthma were found for pig keeping (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38- 0.86), farm milk consumption (OR, CI, 0.60-0.99),frequent stay in animal sheds (OR, 0.54-0.95),child's involvement in haying (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.98; for nonatopic asthma) and in Germany for agriculture (OR, 0.34; 95% CI,0.22-0.53). Protective factors were related with higherexpression levels of genes of the innate immunity. Potential risk factors for asthma and wheeze were also identied in the farm milieu. Levels of endotoxin and extracellular polysaccharideswere related to the health outcomes independently of thefarm exposures.Conclusions: The protective effect of being raised in a farm environment was ascribed to distinct exposures.Clinical implications: The development of atopic sensitizationand atopic and nonatopic asthma is most likely determined by different environmental factors, possibly reflecting distinct pathomechanisms. (J Allergy Clin bial components Numerous studies have shown a protective effect of being raised in a farm environment on the development ofhay fever and atopic sensitization among children. 1-11The effects on asthma, however, are inconsistent. Whereas in some studies being raised on a farm was inversely associ-ated with asthma or wheeze ever, 1,2,6,7,9,12,13a substantial number of studies did not nd any signicant associa- tion,4,5,10,11,14-16and in some regions a tendency toward a positive association of farming with asthma was re-vealed. 2,17These controversial results have raised some doubt about a true farm effect on asthma. However, a more differentiated look at distinct farm-related exposuresand specic asthma phenotypes might be useful.

Dust from animal sheds is rich in endo- toxin19and muramic acid,20both bacterial components that can activate innate immunity, thereby potentially af- fecting the development of asthma and allergic diseases. Farming practices and hence microbial exposures vary between farms. The global analysis of the multicenter Prevention of Allergy Risk Factors for Sensitization in Children Related to Farming and Anthroposophic Life-style (PARSIFAL) study revealed a weak effect of being raised on a farm on asthma, with substantial heterogeneity across study regions. 21The present analysis aimed at disentangling the differential effects of various farm-asso- ciated exposures on specic asthma-related health out- comes, thereby explaining the heterogeneous ndings.Furthermore, the contribution of several microbial compo- nents to the identied effects was studied. METHODS Population and study areas The PARSIFAL study was a cross-sectional survey on children of farmers, children attending Rudolf Steiner schools, and their res- pective reference groups. The study was carried out as described previously.21In the farming branch of the study, children aged 5 to 13 years from rural areas of Austria, Germany, The Netherlands,Sweden, and Switzerland were invited to participate. Of the 11,969 invited children, 8402 (70%) returned the questionnaires. A total of 139 children were excluded because of missing values for sex andage or because they did not, on review, meet the age criteria of 5 to 13 years. Of the included 8263 children, 88% had complete values for all farm exposure variables. The study was approved by the na-tional ethical boards of the 5 study centers, and informed consentwas obtained from the children's parents or guardians for question- naires and blood samples. Questionnaire The questionnaire included questions on sociodemographic back- ground, family history of asthma and atopy, exposure to farm environment, animals, pets, housing, nutrition, and the child's health. Questions on health outcome and farm exposure were derived fromthe internationally validated International Study of Asthma andAllergies in Childhood II 22questionnaire and the Allergy and Endotoxin study.7Children with reported physician-diagnosed asthma once or obstructive bronchitis more than once in their lifetimewere dened as having asthma ever . Wheezing during the past 12 months was considered current wheeze . A child who lived on a farm and whose family ran the farm was coded as being a farm child (n52823), whereas all other children were termed reference chil- dren (n55440). Questions concerning farm life and farm exposure were asked to both farm and reference children, covering regularstays in animal sheds or barns; regular participation in farm activities, such as harvesting of hay; consumption of farm milk; regular contact with farm animals; and maternal involvement in farm work during pregnancy. Farmers were asked whether they performed livestockfarming, agriculture (cultivation of grain), or combinations of these.Data on farm characteristics, such as animal species kept on the farm (cattle, pigs, poultry, horses, sheep, goats, hares, and rabbits) or animal feed (pressed hay, loose hay, pellet feed, and silage),were also collected. The children's farm activities at present were dichotomized into rarely or regularly (at least once a week). Measurement of allergen-specic serum IgE Blood analysis was performed in a subsample of 2086 children, which did not differ substantially from the whole sample with respect to farm exposures. Allergen-specic IgE for common inhalant(Phadiatop) and food allergens (fx5; Pharmacia atopic sensitization and distinction between atopic and nonatopic asthma or wheeze was based on IgE values of 0.35 kU/L or greater forinhalant or food allergens. Expression of CD14 and Toll-like receptor Gene expression of CD14 and Toll-like receptor (TLR) was assessed in 268 Swiss children, among them 56% farm children. Children with available RNA samples (95.3% of children who pro-vided blood samples) did not differ signicantly from the total Swiss PARSIFAL population with respect to farm exposures and health outcomes (data not shown). Detection methods are described in the Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. Detection of microbial components Levels of endotoxin, b(1/3)-glucan, and fungal extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) were measured in mattress dust samples of 440 children. Sampling and detection methods are described else- where23(see also this article's supplementary Methods text in the Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed with SAS 9.1.3 (The SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Odds ratios (ORs) from bivariate analysis or logistic regression models are given with 95% CIs. Frequencies offarm characteristics were calculated as percentages of all farms ( Table I), and children's activities on farms were calculated as percentages of all children ( Table II ). Parsimonious models ( Fig 1 ) were established for every outcome separately by means of backward elimination with a signicance level of .157, corresponding to Akaike's information criterion, to identify the individual effects of single farm characteristics andthe children's activities. The backward elimination started with thefollowing set of variables: family history of asthma or atopy, respec- tively; sex, being a farm child, and study center; agriculture; keeping pigs, poultry, horses, sheep, goats, hares, or rabbits; feeding pressedhay, loose hay, silage, or pellet feed at the farm; and predominantfarm milk consumption by the child, regular stays in animal sheds, regular stays in barns, regular contact with farm animals, and helping with haying. Models for atopic sensitization additionally includedmaternal exposure to animal sheds during pregnancy. 24In some study regions, being a farm child, livestock farming, and cattle keeping were collinear, and therefore the latter 2 variables were not included in backward elimination. The specic determinants for the atopic and nonatopic phenotypes of asthma and wheeze were explored by using the same procedure starting from the same set of variables ( Fig 2 ). In a sensitivity analysis further variables (age, parental educational level, daycare attendance,J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 119, NUMBER 5Ege 1141 Environmental and occupational respiratory disordersduration of breast-feeding, contact with pets, reported childhood infections, worm infestation, and use of antibiotics or antipyretics) were explored but did not confound the associations. All exposures that contributed signicantly to the models in Fig 1 were used to calculate propensity scores for being a farm child (ie, theprobability of being a farm child dependent on the farming expo- sures). The resulting propensity scores were then used as scalar var- iables to adjust for being a farm child in the analyses investigating theeffects of microbial components on asthma, wheeze, and atopy. 25 Values for exposure levels of microbial contaminants were obtainedby means of division of measured concentrations by weight of col-lected mattress dust followed by log transformation, resulting in nor-mal distribution. Data on microbial components were only available for a subsample selected for wheezing and atopy status, 23and there- fore stratied weighted logistic regression was performed.26Each observation was weighted by the inverse probability of beingselected to the subsample of dust analysis. In a nal step heterogeneity across study regions of the effect of farming on asthma was assessed, looking at farms with and withoutagriculture separately. ORs for farming were calculated stratied forstudy regions and compared by using Breslow-Day tests. In multiple regression models interaction terms for farming and study regions were explored. RESULTS Characteristics of farms and children's activities on farms Information on farms is provided in Table I . The ques- tions regarding farm characteristics were not mutually ex- clusive, and therefore percentages do not sum up to 100%.Because the PARSIFAL study was deliberately performed in regions of dairy farming, the predominant form of farm- ing was livestock, in particular cattle. Yet substantial num-bers of other animals were kept on the farms as well. Of thelivestock farms, 37% also performed agriculture, most likely to provide fodder for their animals. Only 24% of ag- ricultural farms did not also raise livestock. Because farmTABLE I.

Mutually adjusted ORs with 95% CIs additionally adjusted for sex, study center, group, and family history of asthma are shown.Atopic sensitization was adjusted for sex, study center, family history of atopy, and additionally for maternalexposure to animal sheds during pregnancy. The models were established by using backward eliminationbased on Akaike's information criterion.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL MAY 20071142 Ege et al Environmental and occupational respiratory disorderscharacteristics might reflect a child's exposure only to a limited extent, children's activities on a farm were assessedalso for farm and farm reference children ( Table II ). A third of the reference children in these rural areas were exposed to farm animals on a regular basis (ie, at least once a week).The prevalences of the lifetime diagnosis of asthma and of current wheeze in farm children were 6.3% and 5.0%, respectively, and in reference children they were 9.1%and 7.7%, respectively. Effects of farm characteristics and children's activities on asthma, wheeze, and atopicsensitization Fig 1 shows the mutually adjusted models for asthma, wheeze, and atopic sensitization resulting from backwardelimination. Variables with nonsignicant associations with the health outcomes in these models are not listed (ie, horses kept on the farm, goats kept on the farm; pelletfeed or other animal feed; and children's regular contactwith specic farm animal species [cattle, pigs, sheep, poul- try, horses, goats, and hares/rabbits]). The lifetime diagno- sis of asthma was inversely associated with agriculture(OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.89), pig farming (OR, farm milk consumption (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-0.99), frequent stay in animal sheds (OR,0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95), and child's involvement in hay- 95% CI, 0.38-0.81), and there was border- line using silage as feed (OR, 0.72; 0.49-1.06). of hares and rabbits (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.16-2.50) and the use of pressed hay (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.93-1.88) were positively associated.Current wheeze was inversely related to pig farming (OR,0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.95), farm milk consumption (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.96), and frequent stays in barns (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.84); the presence of sheep,however, was positively associated with wheezing (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.13-2.61). Frequent stays in barn were also inversely associated with atopic sensitization, as wellas agriculture and keeping pigs and poultry on the farm. The use of loose hay as fodder was positively associated with atopic sensitization. When adjusting for the child's ac-tivities and farm characteristics, the variable of being a farm child was not any longer inversely related with asthma, wheeze, or atopy; in other words, the variables includedin the nal models explained the effect of farming onasthma, wheeze, and atopy completely (data not shown). Effects of farm characteristics and children's activities on the expression of CD14 and TLR genes Table III gives the geometric means ratios for the ex- pression of CD14 andTLR genes, depending on the vari- ous farm characteristics and children's activities that wererelated to asthma or wheeze from Fig 1 . Interestingly, the different exposures exhibited specic effects on different genes. Because of a high correlation ( r>0.8) of the vari- ables regular stays in animal sheds, regular stays in barns,and maternal exposure to stables during pregnancy withbeing a farm child in the Swiss subsample, independent effects of these variables could not be studied. Atopic and nonatopic phenotypes of asthma and wheeze Besides for asthma and atopic sensitization, some specic determinants for either asthma or atopic sensitization were also detected. This observa- tion prompted a differential evaluation of the asthma andwheeze phenotypes with respect to a child's atopy status. As shown in Fig 2 , only agriculture exhibited an inverse relation with both phenotypes of asthma. Further effectson atopic asthma were exerted by pig farming (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.60), regular consumption of farm milk (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 95% CI, 0.31-1.01), 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17-0.57). Sheepfarming and feeding loose or pressed hay were positively associated with the atopic phenotype. Interestingly, the use of silage was protective for nonatopic asthma (OR,0.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.98). For wheeze, almost the same determinants were found (data not shown): pig farming, silage, and barn stays were inversely related to atopicwheeze, and sheep farming and feeding loose hay were positively related; barn stays tended to be protective for nonatopic wheeze. Protective and risk-associated farm characteristics with respect to asthmaand wheeze The 742 of 2813 farm children who were growing up in a strongly protective farm environment (ie, exposed to 4 or 5 ''asthma-protective'' factors) had an asthma prevalenceof less than 3%. On the other hand, 210 farm children wereexposed to asthma risk factors (keeping hares or rabbits and feeding pressed hay), and only 1 or no protective factors. This group of children had an asthma prevalenceof 17%. Children living on farms where sheep but no pigs or cows were kept had prevalences of wheeze and asthma up to 4 times higher than their peers living on farms wherepigs or cows but no sheep were kept (12% vs 3% and 14% vs 3% for wheeze and respectively). FIG 2. Farm-related specic determinants for atopic and nonatopic asthma. Mutually adjusted ORs with 95% CIs additionally adjusted for number of older siblings, sex, study center and family history of asthma, where appropriate, are shown. The models were estab-lished by using backward elimination based on Akaike's informationcriterion in the subsample of children selected for measurement IgE levels.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 119, NUMBER 5Ege et al 1143 Environmental and occupational respiratory disorderschildren with risk factors for atopy (sheep and loose hay) but no protective factors had a prevalence of 14% for atopic sensitization, whereas among the 109 farm children with no risk-associated factors but at least 3 protectivefactors, only 2 (1.8%) children were sensitized. Effects of microbial substances on asthma and related health outcomes Fig 3 shows the mutually adjusted effects of endotoxin, glucans, and EPS levels in mattress dust on asthma, wheeze, and atopic sensitization. Glucans were not signicantly associated with any of the 3 outcomes but tended to be protective for atopic sensitization. EPSs were inversely related to asthma with borderline signicance to distinction of atopic and nonatopic phenotypes did not reveal more information, most likely because of limited sample sizes. The protective effect of being a farm childon current wheeze was explained by the levels of exposure to endotoxin, glucans, and EPSs (adjusted OR, 0.89), whereas for asthma (adjusted OR, 0.55) and atopic sensi-tization (adjusted OR, 0.38), the protective effect of being a farm child was not explained by the levels of theseexposures. Although children from farms with pigs but without sheep had endotoxin levels (geometric mean, 41,438 EU/g; 29,551-58,107 EU/g) in mattress dust al- most twice as high as those seen in children from sheepfarms without pigs (26,909 EU/g; 17,192-42,118 EU/g), this difference is unlikely to reflect the underlying mecha- nisms of the effects of pig and sheep keeping on asthmaand sensitization because the variables of keeping sheep and keeping pigs did not change the OR for endotoxin (data not shown). Heterogeneity across countries The crude asthma OR for being a farm child versus that seen in reference children varied substantially across countries.21A low OR was found in Germany (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32-0.64), whereas in the other 4 countries theOR was close to unity (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.72-1.17). The effect was not heterogeneous among these 4 countries (P5.85), but it was heterogeneous between them and Germany ( P5.013). Thus the 2 subsamples (children from countries without a farm effect and the German sub- sample) were analyzed for differences in farm character-istics. When comparing children from farms without agriculture with reference children, the effect of farmingTABLE III.

However, when comparing children from farms with agri-culture with reference children, the effect was strong inGermany (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.23-0.55) but marginal in the other 4 countries (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.65-1.33). Heterogeneity of effects between the 2 subsamples wasformally proved by using a highly signicant Breslow- Day test ( P5.0007) and a signicant interaction term in multiple regression analysis ( P5.0015). DISCUSSION The present study revealed distinct protective expo- sures for asthma and wheeze (agriculture, pig farming, silage, haying, farm milk, animal sheds, and barns). Most of these exposures were related to the atopic phenotypes,but silage exerted a protective effect only on the nonatopicphenotype. Furthermore, potential risk factors for asthma and wheeze have been identied in the farm milieu (sheep and hare keeping and using hay as feed). For atopicsensitization, agriculture, pig, and poultry farming and barns were identied as protective factors. Collectively, the identied factors explained the protective effect ofbeing a farm child on asthma. Endotoxin and EPS levels were related to asthma, wheeze and atopic sensitization independently of the farm characteristics and the child'sactivities. Potential determinants of asthma, wheeze, and atopic sensitization The effects of frequent stays in animal sheds and farm milk consumption have been described previously.7,24 A detailed analysis of the effects of farm milk and otherdairy products is the subject of a separate article. 18 The large sample size of the PARSIFAL study pro- vided the opportunity to differentiate between several animal species usually kept on farms. In this context the identication of pig keeping, in our study populationsmostly in combination with cattle keeping, as a potential protective factor for all 3 health outcomes is an interesting nding. An inverse relation of pig keeping with atopicsensitization has also been detected in two studiesperformed in Guinea-Bissau 27and New Zealand.16In contrast, in an Iowa population pigs were found to be pos-itively related to asthma. 17In our analysis the protective effects of pigs on asthma and atopy were consistent across all countries (data not shown). The discrepancy between the American study and the other studies might be ex-plained by different farm sizes and hence children's expo- sure. At least in our study population, more than 80% of pig farmers kept less than 10 pigs, and exclusive pig farm-ing was very uncommon in the study population (n 534). Four (12%) children from exclusive pig farms had a phy- sician's diagnosis of asthma, whereas only 35 (4%) of 884children from dairy farms with additional pig keeping hadasthma ( P5.0514). An exploratory analysis of the num- ber of pigs kept on a farm did not reveal any dose- response effect. An explanation for the effects of pigkeeping might be found in specic microbial exposures present in farms where pigs are kept in addition to cattle. In contrast to pig keeping, sheep farming increased the risk for atopic asthma and wheeze. This might be a plausible nding because for sheep breeders, a higher risk of respiratory syndromes has been described, possiblycaused by disinfectants, such as formaldehyde or copper sulfate. 28Whether this explanation can be applicable to children remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, sheepkeeping might obscure a protective farm effect on asthmain populations where sheep breeding is common. 16 Harvesting, storage, and feeding of hay in various forms is another key feature of farms. Active participationin haying, however, might be avoided by children with asthma or allergies, implying potential reverse causation. In the PARSIFAL study only 62 families ( <1% of all) reported that the child avoided haying because of manifest disease or for prevention, and the effect of haying was still present when the analysis was restricted to childrenwithout sensitization to grass pollen (data not shown). One could imagine that small dust particles inhaled during haying might act as carriers of protective agents, such asmicrobial antigens or immunomodulatory substances(eg, mycotoxins). This notion is supported by the gene expression studies showing that active participation in haying was associated with higher gene expression ofseveral TLR genes ( Table III ). FIG 4. Effect of being a farm child on asthma in agricultural and nonagricultural farms. Crude ORs are given with 95% CIs for asthma diagnosis dependent on being a farm child separately for the German subsample and the subsample of the 4 other countries. Pvalues refer to Breslow-Day tests for homogeneity of effects.J IMMUNOL VOLUME 119, NUMBER 5Ege et al 1145 Environmental and occupational respiratory disordersIn turn, a positive association of pressed hay with asthma and of loose hay with atopic asthma and atopicsensitization was found. Yet this does not necessarily contradict the potential protective effect of active partic- ipation in haying because the microbial colonization offresh hay differs substantially from that of stored hay. 29,30 Barns do not only comprise hay lofts but are also storageplaces for other farm products, such as crop, grain, andstraw. Therefore it is conceivable that the protective effect of barns is present despite a disadvantageous effect of pressed or loose hay. Silage is of special interest because it was only clearly protective for the nonatopic phenotypes of asthma and wheeze. Silage contains vast amounts of lactobacilli but also other microbes with potential immunomodulatoryeffects, such as aspergilli 31and listeriae.32Small but activity. 31Listeria monocytogenes32is known for its ability to stimulate the innate immune sys- tem and to convert T H2-dominated immune responses into T H1-dominated responses.33 The exact molecular mechanisms of the farm-related exposures and their benecial and, in some cases, also probably harmful effects on asthma remain, however,unknown. The observation that these farm-related expo- sures are associated with the differential expression of the CD14 andTLR genes ( Table III ) supports the idea of dis- tinct effects on a molecular level. Various exposures might differentially affect the innate immune system in qualita- tive and quantitative terms. A striking nding of the present analysis was the identication of agriculture as having the power to explain the heterogeneous effects of farming on asthma betweenGermany and the other study regions. Because the effectof agriculture on asthma was only present in Germany, comparing the practices and products of agriculture of the German areas with those of the other PARSIFAL studyregions might be helpful. Unfortunately, no supplemental data on agriculture were available in the data set. However, because most of the agricultural farms ( >80%) of the German subsample concomitantly raised livestock (cattle/ pigs), cultivation of feed grain is the most probable form of agriculture. Culture of fodder beets, oilseeds, potatoes, orcereals for human nutrition is likely to play a minor role in these areas. Contamination of feeding grain with immu- nomodulatory mycotoxins is a well-known phenome-non, 34-37and one might speculate that feeding grain could contain benecial immunomodulatory substances. In particular, pigs are fed with bruised grain, which can be contaminated with deoxynivalenol, a trichothecene my-cotoxin that enhances proinflammatory gene expression after costimulation by TLR ligands, such as endotoxin. 38 Independent effects of endotoxin and glucans Mattress dust samples of selected farm and reference children were examined to back up the questionnaire datawith objective biologic parameters. A previous analysis ofthe same data set focused on atopic wheeze ever as an outcome because of the stratied sampling design. 39After adjustment of farming, no signicant associations of the outcomes with the biocontaminants under investigation were seen. The present analysis used weighted stratiedlogistic regression to overcome problems of the sampling design, thereby rendering exploration of further outcomes, such as lifetime diagnosis of asthma, current wheeze, andatopic sensitization, possible. The protective effect of endotoxin on atopic sensitiza- tion is in accordance with that seen in previous studies. 19,40 b(1/3)-glucans are cell-wall constituents of most fungi, but are also found in some bacteria and many plants.41 The inverse association of glucans with atopic sensiti-zation did not reach statistical signicance, potentiallybecause of limited sample size, but the estimate was stronger than for endotoxin. EPSs of Aspergillus and Penicillium species are more specic markers of indoor fungal exposure. 41The inverse association of EPSs with asthma is a novel nding. Of all 3 microbial sub- stances, EPSs were most closely related to being a farmchild (data not shown). The associations of the 3 biocontaminants with the asthma-related health outcomes were independent of the farm characteristics and the children's activities. Hencethey might represent exposures not adequately covered by questionnaire data. On the other hand, the exposures identied through questionnaires, such as agricultureor pig farming, were not traced back to the microbial compounds under investigation, ultimately prompting exploration of further microbial substances (eg, thosefound in agriculture or animal feed). Conclusion The asthma-protective effect of being raised on a farm in the PARSIFAL study can be attributed to pig farming,feeding silage, child's involvement in haying, farm milkconsumption, and regular stay in animal sheds and barns. In Germany performing agriculture contributed im- portantly to the asthma-protective effect. The microbialcompounds investigated thus far do not explain the inverse relation of asthma prevalence with farm characteristics and children's activities but exert independent effects. Theidentication of highly protective farms might direct future research to investigate microbial contamination of distinct farms with their individual animal species andfeeds. REFERENCES 1.

Methods: Questionnaire data, serum IgE levels, and genotypesfor 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms in CD14 were assessed in farmers' and nonfarmers' children from 2 European populations (Allergy and Endotoxin study, n 5576; Prevention of Allergy Risk factors for Sensitization in children related toFarming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle study, n 51539). In a subsample (n 5222) CD14 gene expression was measured in peripheral blood leukocytes. The effects of farm milk and CD14 genotypes on asthma, allergies, and CD14 expression and their interactions were investigated. Results: We found a signicant interaction between genetic variation in CD14/21721 and farm milk consumption. Adjusted odds ratios for the association between farm milk and asthma varied between the genotypes: AA, 0.18 (95% Similar observed of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and pollen sensitization. CD14/21721 also modied the association between farm milk and CD14 gene expression (adjusted geometric means ratios: AA, 1.61 (95% CI, 0.39-1.48).Conclusion: The protective effect of farm milk consumption on allergic diseases is stronger in children carrying the A allele inCD14/21721 than in children homozygous for the G allele. This might be mediated through farm milk-induced upregulated CD14 gene expression. Clinical implications: Our results support the hypothesis thatthe inverse association between farm milk consumption and allergic diseases is mediated by CD14 -activated innate immune mechanisms.

Key words: Allergy, asthma, CD14 , gene-environment interaction, gene expression, farming, epidemiology Several studies in rural populations have demonstrated that living on a farm provides a protective environment for the development of allergic diseases.1In addition to farm animal contact2and microbial compounds,3such as LPS, more recently, farm milk consumption has been identied as another characteristic of a farming lifestyle that mightconfer protection against allergic diseases. 2,4-7The rele- vant compound or compounds responsible for the protec- tive farm milk effect and the underlying biologic mechanisms are still unclear, although several suggestionshave been put forward.

Alternatively, compounds other than microbes, such ashigh levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, in farm milk might play a role. 8-10 CD14 is a key molecule of the innate immune system serving as a receptor and carrier for microbial ligands11 and other lipid-containing molecules.12-14As previously shown in genetic studies, a polymorphism in the CD14 gene, CD14/C-260T , might interact with environmental factors in the development of asthma and atopic dis- eases.15,16Although the mechanisms of gene-environment interactions are largely unknown, a polymorphism in thepromoter region of a gene might exert its effect by modu- lating gene expression. Recently published reports support this possibility and suggest that variation in gene expres-sion is of importance in the interplay among environment, genes, and disease. 17,18 In the present study we therefore aimed to investigate whether the negative association between allergic health outcomes and farm milk consumption is modied by poly- morphisms in CD14 and whether a genotype-specic protec- tive effect is associated with increased expression of CD14 . METHODS Population Data from farmers' children and nonfarmers' children enrolled in 2 cross-sectional surveys, the Allergy and Endotoxin (ALEX) study and the Prevention of Allergy - Risk Factors for Sensitisationin Children Related to Farming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle (PARSIFAL) study, were analyzed in this study. Both surveys aimed to explore protective factors associated with farming and asthma andallergies in childhood. The methods used were similar and partlyidentical. Details of the selection process are described in Fig E1 in the Online Repository (available at www.jacionline.org ). Ethical permis- sion for each study was obtained from local authorities in each center. In brief, the ALEX study 2was a cross-sectional study conducted in 1999 with an overall participation rate of 75%. Of the families who gave consent for further investigations, all farmers' children, all non- farmers' children with contact to farming, and a random sample ofnonexposed nonfarmers' children were invited for blood sampling. Complete questionnaire data and a blood sample were available for 812 children. Of these, consent for genetic analyses was not givenfor 120 Swiss children, and no adequate DNA sample was availablefor 8 children from Germany and Austria, leaving 684 children (258 farmers' and 426 nonfarmers' children) for genotyping.In 2001, farmers' children and nonfarmers' children were recruited as part of the PARSIFAL study in the same countries but from different geographic areas and additionally in Sweden and The Netherlands. 19Parents of these children completed a self-adminis- tered questionnaire to assess asthma and allergies and exposuresassociated with farming. The overall participation rate was 70%. Participants were also asked for consent to further investigations, in- cluding a venous blood sample. Consent to genetic analyses and anadequate sample of DNA were available for 1907 children. In case more than 1 child per family participated in the study, only the eldest sibling was included in the analyses to fulll the assumptionof independent observations. The nal sample sizes for the ALEXand PARSIFAL studies were therefore reduced to 576 (209 farmers' and 367 nonfarmers' children) and 1478 (957 farmers' and 521 nonfarmers' children) children, respectively. Phenotypes In both study populations the same questions and thereby the same denition of phenotypes were used. Asthma was dened as a physi- cian's diagnosis of asthma or recurrent asthmatic, spastic, or obstruc- tive bronchitis. Children whose parents reported ''wheezing orwhistling in the chest in the last 12 months'' were classied as havingcurrent wheeze. Current symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis were dened as a positive response to the following question: ''In the last 12 months, has your child had problems with sneezing or a runnyor blocked nose without a cold accompanied by itchy-watery eyes?'' The concentrations of specic IgE against common with the ImmunoCAP (Phadia, codes for are givenin brackets below) in all sera and in both populations. In the ALEX study specic serum IgE levels against timothy grass pollen (g6), house in the PARSIFAL study specic serum IgE levels against grass pollen mix (gx3; timothy grass, sweet vernal grass, rye grass, cultivated rye, and velvet grass),tree pollen mix (tx9; birch, grey alder, hazel, 4Two different cut-off values (0.35 and 3.5 kU/L) were used for analyses. Exposure to farm milk in the rst year of life In both studies exposure to farm milk (cow's milk from self- production or directly purchased from a farm) in the rst year of life was dened in children whose parents reported that the child began to drink farm milk at the age of 1 year or less (n 5909). Children not exposed to farm milk in the rst year of life started either later (n 5 257) or did not drink farm milk but rather any kind of shop-purchased cow's milk (n 5847). The latter 2 groups formed the group of children (n51104) who were not exposed to farm milk in the rst year of life. Non-milk-drinking children (n 58) were excluded from the analyses to avoid potential primary milk avoidance because of allergy- related symptoms at younger ages. Genotyping DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLCs) by using standard techniques. CD14 was screened for single nucleotide polymorphisms ( http://innateimmunity.net SNPs closely linked with known polymorphisms (R2>0.7) and with a minor allele frequency of greater than 10% were chosen for this study by using the algorithm implemented inldSelect. 20This algorithm is based tical power to detect unassayed, disease-associated polymorphisms depends on the correlation (R2)between the unassayed and theJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 120, NUMBER 6Bieli et al 1309 Mechanisms of asthma and allergic These SNPs because of linkage disequilibrium withanR 2value of 0.7 or less to other SNPs in the reference population (http://innateimmunity.net ). Genotyping for both populations was done in the same laboratory by using identical methods. (Arizona Res-piratory Center, Tucson, Ariz). Genomic DNA was assayed by using the 59exonuclease reaction (Taqman; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). Primer and probe sequences used and further details ofthe genotyping method are available from the author on request. Expression of CD14 For the Swiss branch of the PARSIFAL study, RNA samples of PBLCs were collected from 316 children (95.3% of children whoprovided blood samples in Switzerland) to analyze gene expression of innate immunity receptors (see Fig E1 in the Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). After restriction to the eldest siblings, the nal sample consisted of 222 children, of whom 132 were exposed to farmmilk in the rst year of life and 89 were not (1 missing). Total RNA was isolated by using the QIAmp RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, tions were analyzed on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Experiments assessing background sig-nals were performed for every assay by running the reaction withouttemplates (''no template control''). In none of these was any template control amplication observed, indicating that there was no contami- nation or unspecic fluorescence. The data are presented as normalizedvalues (the amount of mRNA of the target molecule divided by the amount of mRNA of the endogenous control [18S rRNA]). Statistical analyses Genotype frequencies in the ALEX and PARSIFAL populations were calculated and compared with those of a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by using the x 2goodness-of-t test with 1 df. The prevalences of reported asthma, current wheezing, current sensitization (allergen genotypes of the 4 investigated CD14 SNPs. Odds ratios (ORs) for the associationbetween the phenotypes and being a farm child (a child who lived on a farm and whose family ran the farm), between phenotypes and contact with stable animals in the rst year of life, and between phenotypes and farm milk consumption in the rst year of life were estimated intheCD14 genotypes and tested for homogeneity by using Mantel- Haenszel statistics. The following factors were considered as potential confounders for the association between exposure and outcome and included in themultiple logistic and multiple linear regression models in case of a univariate association ( P<.150) to the independent variable of inter- est: sex, age in years (5-6, 7-8, 9, 10-11, or 12-13 years), maternaleducation (low, medium, and high), number of elder siblings (none,1, 2, 3, or more), passive smoking (0, 1-9, or >10 cigarettes per day), study center, being a farm child, and breast-feeding (exclusively /C215 months and <5 months). Associations are presented as ORs for binomial data and as exponentiated regression coefcients (geometric means ratios) for numeric data. The coding of the genotype was done according to the best-tting model on the basis of Akaike's information criterion 21to test for statistical interaction: ordinal (reflecting an additive genetic model), bi- nomial (homozygous one allele vs heterozygous and homozygous ofthe other allele, reflecting a dominant or a recessive genetic model, re-spectively), or categorical (no genetic model). The likelihood ratio test was performed to test the null hypothesis of no interaction. Two-sided Pvalues of less than .05 were considered signicant. The robustness of our results was checked by repeating the analyses in the subsamples of farmers' and nonfarmers' children. All analyses were carried out with STATA/SE 8.0 software (StataCorp, College Station, Tex) and R 2.4.0 (R: A Language andEnvironment for Statistical Computing; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). RESULTS Study population Table I shows the genotype frequencies of the 4 inves- tigated CD14 polymorphisms. Genotype frequencies did not differ between the ALEX and PARSIFAL studies (Table I ) or between early farm milk drinkers and non- farm milk drinkers, respectively (data not shown). Inboth populations, no signicant deviation from Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium was observed (data not shown) for all 4 polymorphisms. Residual linkage disequilibriumwas found between CD14/ 21721 and CD14/ 2260 in both populations (see Tables E1 and E2 in the Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). Characteristics and the prevalence of asthma and aller- gies in the 2 main populations and in the PARSIFAL subpopulation are described in Table II . Because of differ- ent study designs in the ALEX and PARSIFAL surveys,which resulted in different proportions of farmers' chil- dren, the prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivi- tis, and specic serum IgE to aeroallergens differedbetween the study populations. Effects of CD14/21721 genotypes and farm milk consumption on allergic diseases TheCD14/ 21721 SNP is characterized by a substitu- tion of adenine by guanine in the promoter of the CD14 gene. There was no signicant association between CD14/TABLE I.

Children who consumed farm milk in the rst year of life were less likely to have asthma, symptoms of allergic rhi- noconjunctivitis, and previously reported By using Mantel-Haenszel test statistics for homoge- neity of ORs across strata, the protective effect of farmmilk consumption differed between the genotypes of CD14/ 21721 in the ALEX and PARSIFAL populations (data not shown; prevalences of allergic health outcomesstratied by genotypes and main exposures are shown in Tables E3-E5 in the Online Repository at www.jacionline. org). This heterogeneity between genotypes remained after adjusting for potential confounding in multiple re- gression analyses ( Table III ). Moreover, the effect patterns were similar in both populations for asthma, current wheeze, symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and pollen sensitization. Overall, in the majority of the health outcomes, childrenhomozygous for GG in CD14/ 21721 did not show an inverse association with farm milk consumption. For asthma, current wheeze, and symptoms of allergic rhino- conjunctivitis, the inverse association with farm milkwas strongest in the AA genotype, intermediate in the AG genotype, and absent in the GG genotype. No effect modication by CD14/ 21721 genotypes was observed for the association between farm milk consumption and sensitization to any allergen ( /C213.5 /C213.5 IU/mL), a strongprotective farm milk effect was seen in the CD14/ 21721 AA and AG genotypes but not in the GG genotype (Table III ). Similar associations were observed when a cut-off value of 0.35 kU/L was used to dene sensi-tization, even though trends were more pronounced in the PARSIFAL population. When the combined population was stratied into farmers' and nonfarmers' children, the gene-environment interaction between CD14/ 21721 and farm milk con- sumption in the rst year of life was also seen, althoughthe formal test for interaction was mostly not signicant(Table IV ). When both study populations were combined, interac- tions between CD14/ 21721 genotypes and were signicant ( P5.003), current symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis ( P5.04), and spe- cic IgE against pollen of 3.5 kU/mL or greater ( P5.027). To evaluate the effect of timing of farm milk con- sumption, we categorized early and current farm milk consumption into 4 groups (early no, current no; earlyyes, current no; early no, current yes; early yes, current yes). Only children who drank farm milk in the rst year of life (independently of current consumption) showedheterogeneity in frequencies of allergic health outcomeswhen stratied by CD14/ 21721 genotypes (see Table ). The genotypes of CD14/ 21721 modied neither the association between being a farm child and allergic phe- notypes (asthma, current wheeze, symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and atopic sensitization) nor the asso-ciation between stable animal contact in the rst year of life and allergic phenotypes (see Tables E4 and E5 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ).TABLE II.

Previously published resultsshowed that farmers' children expressed higher amounts of CD14 on PBLCs than nonfarmers' children (data not shown). 17,18In the univariate analysis PBLCs of early farm milk drinkers appeared to express more CD14 thanthose of non 2farm milk drinkers. However, when ad- justed for being a farm child, this association was no lon- ger signicant (adjusted geometric means: no early farmmilk consumption, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.29-0.43]; milk consumption, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.36-0.47]; P5 .258]), thus making a direct farm milk effect unlikely. Moreover, mean gene expression was similar in CD14/ 21721 genotypes (geometric means: heterogeneity of the farm milk effect on CD14 gene expression (see Fig 1 , including ORs for asthma presented inTable III to emphasize the similarity of the effect pattern). Children with a history of drinking farm milk in the rstyear of life and having either the AA or the AG genotype inCD14/ 21721 expressed 61% and 11%, respectively, more CD14 compared with children not drinking farm milk in the rst year of life. In contrast, children with theGG genotype expressed 24% less CD14 if they had con-sumed farm milk in the rst year of life than if they had not. Results of the CD14/24191 ,CD14/22839 , andCD14/2260polymorphisms There 22839 2260polymorphisms and asthma or allergies or CD14 gene expression. There was also no clear pattern of interaction between any of the polymorphisms and farm milk consumption on thephenotypes under study, except for symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the last 12 months in CD14/ 24191 (see Tables E7-E10 in the Online Repository at www. jacionline.org ). DISCUSSION The results of our analyses suggest that a polymorphism in the CD14 gene (CD14/ 21721) modies the previously described inverse association of early farm milk consump- tion on allergic diseases in children. This gene- environ- ment interaction was seen in 2 independent ruralpopulations and was independent of being a farm child.TABLE III.

Pvalues are given for the best-tting model, as represented by superscript letters: a, DECEMBER 20071312 Bieli et inflammationIn addition, CD14/ 21721 genotypes signicantly modi- ed the association between farm milk consumption andCD14 expression in peripheral blood cells. These results suggest a biologic mechanism underlying the gene- environment interaction found for genetic variation inthe CD14 gene and farm milk consumption in early lifeon the development of asthma and allergies in this study. CD14 is a pattern-recognition receptor of the innate immune system for a wide spectrum of microbialcompounds, 11such as LPS,22lipoteichoic acid,23and pep- tidoglycan,24but also as phospholipids.12-14This diversity of potential CD14- binding ligands and the fact that the allergy-protective compounds of farm milk have not yet been identied allow speculation about ways in which farm milk consumptionmight mediate the protective effect through CD14. Farm milk is known to contain various bacterial spe- cies, 25and there are 2 plausible and not mutually exclusive ways as to how the microbial composition of the farm milkmight interact with the immune system through CD14. First, farm milk itself might contain microbial compounds that are able to bind to CD14 after penetrating the intesti-nal mucosa. 26Second, strains of probiotic bacteria con- tained in farm milk might have a balancing effect on the intestinal microflora, and their degradation products mightinteract with CD14 after absorption. 27Because CD14 is known to a coreceptor of Toll-like receptors 428and 2,29complexes of CD14 and their ligands might bind toone of these pattern-recognition receptors on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells and hence activate theimmune system, resulting in subsequent production of immunomodulatory chemokines and cytokines. Yet rst analyses of milk samples of an ongoing birth cohort studyin rural areas of Europe indicate that endotoxin levels aresimilar in milk consumed by farmers' and nonfarmers' families (Gehring, submitted) and thus challenge the role of gram-negative microorganisms for the protective farmmilk effect. Alternatively, nonmicrobial molecules contained in the farm milk might be responsible for the protection againstallergic diseases. There is some evidence that omega-3 dietary fatty acids, which have been found at higher levels in the milk of exclusively grass-fed cows than in the milkof cows fed with conserved grass, 30are potentially bene- cial to patients with allergic diseases.8-10Thus animal feeding and also milk processing (fat standardization, pas-teurization, and homogenization) 31might influence the milk's fat content or fatty acid prole. One might therefore speculate that farm milk differs from shop-purchased milk (which represents a mixture of milk produced in different re-gions and different types of farms) regarding its fat amount or composition. Because it is known that CD14 also acts as a receptor and carrier for phospholipids, 12-14fatty acids offer another potential mechanism as to how farm milk consump- tion might mediate protection against allergic diseases through CD14. However, because the immunologicTABLE IV.

Pvalues are given for the best-tting model, as represented by superscript letters: a, additive; 120, NUMBER 6Bieli et al 1313 Mechanisms of asthma and allergic inflammationrelevant component has not been identied, the mechanisms underlying the observed association between farm milkconsumption and allergic diseases remain speculative. Variations in genotypes of CD14/ 21721 not only inter- acted with the effect of farm milk consumption on clinicaloutcomes but also on gene expression of CD14 , suggest- ing that differential gene expression of CD14 might medi- ate the farm milk effect on allergic diseases. BecauseCD14/ 21721 is located in the promoter region of the CD14 gene, it appears plausible that a biologically rele- vant effect of this polymorphism would be mediated bychanges in the transcriptional activity of the CD14 gene. CD14 gene expression was measured in a subsample of the Swiss PARSIFAL children to conrm the biologic relevance of the CD14/ 21721 polymorphism. However, neither farm milk consumption nor one of the CD14/ 21721 genotypes was directly associated with gene ex- pression CD14 . An association between the CD14/ 21721 polymorphism and CD14 gene expression became evident only on exposure to farm milk consumption. Thus the gene-environment interactions underlying the differ-ent health outcomes become evident at the level of geneexpression, indicating that assessment of gene expression might be helpful when evaluating the biologic relevance of polymorphisms in promoter regions. One might specu-late that exposure to farm milk activates antigen-present- ing cells and induces expression of CD14 . This might lead to an increased susceptibility to further stimulationby farm milk-associated agents. To date, no functional data for CD14/ 21721 have been published. We can therefore not exclude the possibilitythat polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with CD14/ 21721 underlie our ndings. For polymorphism in CD14 (CD14/ 2260) 32has been found in different populations to modify the effect of microbial exposures on thedevelopment of atopy. 33,34CD14/ 2260is in disequilibrium with CD14/ 21721 in our population (R2>0.7). Therefore, not surprisingly, several ORs for the associations between farm milk and the phenotypes studied were similar in both SNPs ( Table III andTable E9in the Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). The ORs were, however, less heterogeneous across thegenotypes of CD14/ 2260than across CD14/ 21721 in both populations. Functional studies are needed to further evaluate the mechanisms underlying our observations andto elucidate the role of CD14/ 21721 in the development of asthma- and allergy-related phenotypes in the context of environmental exposures. Recent studies suggest that pollen and house dust mite allergy represent 2 different phenotypes with respect to their genetic and environmental determinants. 4Therefore this nding might represent thus far unappreciated pecu-liarities in the biology of allergen/immune system interac- tions, but experimental studies are needed for further investigation of potential mechanisms. 35 We are aware that the sample size, particularly that of the ALEX population, was low to study gene-environment interactions. Therefore several formal tests for interactionmight not have reached statistical signicance. We do, however, believe that similar trends in the majority of the health outcome measures in the 2 independent study FIG 1.

Nevertheless, our results strongly suggest that biologic effects underliethe observed inverse association between farm milk con- sumption and allergic diseases, thus offering attractive avenues for future preventive measures.

Impact factor 2007: 5.014 80 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli Short communication Gene expression measurements in the context of epidemiological studies High-throughput genomic technologies allow to measure large-scale gene expression proles in a time-ecient way. These methodological advances have spread therange of potential applications and allow gene expres-sion analyses to be used in the context of epidemiolog-ical studies (1, 2). However, in epidemiological study settings, other sources of measurement error have to be considered thanin clinical or laboratory research: distance betweenlocation of blood collection and further processing,dierent eldworkers involved in the studies, and, particularly in international studies, dierent laboratories and laboratory sta are likely to aect quality of theobtained gene expression data. In the present study, we had the possibility to analyse gene expression data of two epidemiologicalstudies [PARSIFAL (3) and PASTURE (4)]. Wecompared centre-associated variations in RNA quanti-ties obtained using two sampling methods. Further-more, we tested the comparability of low-densityarrays, a high-throughput method, with the conven-tional single tube assay to assess gene expression. Finally, the PARSIFAL study allowed us to follow up RNA quality, as multiple measures of the same samplesat dierent time points were available. The aim was toevaluate sources of measurement error in gene expres-sion data in order to avoid these factors in futureinvestigations.Background: Gene expression measurements became an attractive tool to assess biological responses in epidemiological studies. However, collection of bloodsamples poses various technical problems. We used gene expression data from two epidemiological studies to evaluate dierences between sampling methods, comparability of two methods for measuring RNA levels and stability of RNAsamples over time. Methods: For the PARSIFAL study, PBLC of 1155 children were collected using EDTA tubes in two countries. In the PASTURE study, tubes containing RNA-stabilizing solutions (PAXgene /C210Blood RNA Tubes; PreAnalytiX) were used to collect cord blood leucocytes of 982 children in ve countries. Real-time PCR (conventional single tube assay and high-throughput low density arrays) wasused to quantify expression of various innate immunity genes. In 77 PARSIFALsamples, gene expression was measured repeatedly during prolonged storage. Results: In PARSIFAL (EDTA tubes) the median RNA yield after extrac- tion signicantly diered between the two centres (70 and 34 ng/ ll). Collecting blood into an RNA-stabilizing solution markedly reduced dierences in RNA yield in PASTURE (range of medians 91-107 ng/ ll). The agreement [Spearman rank correlation ( r)] between repeated measurements of gene expression de- creased with increasing storage time [e.g., for ment) = 0.35; r(rst/third measurement) = 0.03]. RNA levels measured with either the conventional method or low-density arrays were comparable(r> 0.9). Conclusion: Collecting blood samples into tubes containing an RNA-stabilizing solution increases RNA yield and reduces its variability. Long-term storage ofsamples may lead to RNA degradation, requiring special attention in longitu-dinal studies.C. Bieli 1, R. Frei2, Mutius3, G. Pershagen4, R.

In PARSIFAL, parents from ve countries completed a self- administered questionnaire to assess asthma and allergies and exposures associated with farming. Participants were also asked forconsent to further investigations, including venous blood sampling. In two countries (A and B), a random sample of 1155 farmers /C213and nonfarmers /C213children was drawn for gene expression analyses of innate immunity genes. PASTURE is a longitudinal study conducted in ve European countries (A, B, C, D and E). Each country built a birth cohort of about 100 farmers /C213and 100 nonfarmers /C213children. Several detailed questionnaires were completed and cord blood were collected forthe measurement of the child /C213s immunological status. Gene expression of innate immunity genes was measured in the total population of 982 children. Sample collection and RNA extraction For the PARSIFAL study, PBLC were collected in EDTA blood in2002. Of the 1155 selected samples, 1140 (98.7%) were available for total RNA isolation using the QIAmp RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) supplemented with RNase-free DNase(Qiagen). The RNA was solved in water and stored at )80/C176C. For the PASTURE study cord blood leucocytes from the 982 children were collected in tubes containing an RNA-stabilizingsolution (PAXgene /C210Blood RNA Tubes; PreAnalytiX, Qiagen, Hilden, isolated according to the manufac- turer /C213s instructions. The RNA was treated with DNase and solved inTris-Buer and stored at )80/C176C. Reverse transcription and gene expression analyses Reverse transcription was performed with reagents from Applied Biosystems according to the manufacturer /C213s instructions. The RNA concentration had to reach a cut-o concentration of 21 ng/ llt ob e used for the reverse transcription. Two dierent methods of the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) were used to measure mRNA levels: 1. rtPCR with plates (conventional single tube assay, STA- rtPCR) were performed in a nal volume of 30 ll containing the adequate amounts of cDNA, primers, probe and TaqManUniversal MasterMix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and were analyzed on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System TM(Applied Biosystems). All Microsynth. 2. rtPCR with low-density arrays (LDA-rtPCR) allows to mea- sure the expression of 48 genes with a small amount of cDNA.The LDA-rtPCR was performed in a nal volume of 1 ll and analyzed on an ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression of CD14, TLR2 and TLR4 was analysed in PARSIFAL samples from countries A and B in March 2002 withSTA-rtPCR. The high-throughput method LDA-rtPCR was used to measure the expression of the same genes in a subsample of the PARSIFAL population from country A in November 2004. InSeptember 2005, gene expression measurement of the genes was repeated in all PARSIFAL samples from country A. For CD14, STA-rtPCR analyses were repeated in December 2005 to test the reproducibility of the dierent methods. Statistical analyses To test for equal proportions of nominal variables in dierentgroups, the Chi-squared ( v 2) test was used. Agreement between numeric variables (gene expression measurements) was measured by the spearman rank correlation coecient. All analyses were carried out using R 2.5.0 (R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, R Foundation for Statis- tical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Results RNA amounts extracted using two methods of blood collectionUsing EDTA tubes for blood sampling in the PARSI- FAL study, the median of extracted RNA was twofoldhigher in country A than in country B (Table 1). Consequently, the proportion of samples below the cut- o value for further gene expression analyses (21 ng/ ll) diered greatly between the two countries: whereas98.8% of the samples of country A yielded sucientRNA for gene expression analyses, this was only true for68.9% of the samples of country B. In the PASTURE study, blood was sampled in tubes containing RNA-stabilizing solutions; only slight dier-ences in the amount of extracted RNA were observedbetween the participating countries (Table 1). The coun-try-specic medians were in a narrow range between 91 and 107 ng/ ll. The proportion of samples with sucient RNA amount for gene expression ranged between 91.1%and 99.4%. Reproducibility of high-throughput LDA-rtPCR measurements We measured agreement of rtPCR results of CD14 mRNA levels between the conventional (single tubeassay) and the high-throughput method (low-densityarrays) by calculating rank correlation coecients. Toexclude interfering eects of the reverse transcription, we Table 1.

Correlation of STA-rtPCR and LDA-rtPCR results was high ( r> 0.9, Fig. 1). Consistency of rtPCR CD14 gene expression in repeated measurements over time In 77 samples of the PARSIFAL population of country A gene expression of CD14, TLR2 and TLR4 were analysedrepeatedly in 2002, 2004 and 2005. Figure 2 showsagreement (Spearman rank correlation) of gene expres-sion measurements between 2002 and 2004 and between 2002 and 2005 for CD14, TLR2 and TLR4. For all three genes, the agreement of measurements between 2002 and2004 is moderate (0.35-0.56) and low between 2002 and2005 (0.03-0.32). Discussion We observed that the amount of extracted RNA depends on the method used for blood sampling and thatagreement between rtPCR results decreases over storage time. These results suggest that preanalytical procedures and length of storage time are crucial factors for samplequality. The median amounts of the total extracted RNA amount markedly diered between the two countriesstudied in PARSIFAL. In this study, blood wascollected in EDTA tubes and subsequently transportedto labs in the two study centres, where RNA has been extracted. Although maximal attention was given to control temperature during transport, to minimize transportation time and time until RNA extraction inthe labs, it seems probable that dierences in theseparameters translated into dierent RNA yields be-tween centres. Based on this experience, we then usedin the PASTURE study a blood collection methodsuitable to stabilize RNA directly in the eld. Thismethod resulted in considerably higher RNA yieldswith lower variability between dierent centres. Ittherefore helped to minimize preanalytical errors andproved to yield useful amounts of RNA in the dierent countries involved. Figure 2 shows that the agreement between the results of repeated measurements of the expression of the samegenes in the same samples at various time points duringlong-time storage decreased with each additional mea-surement. Total RNA of these samples was extracted in2002, thereafter stored in water at )80/C176C and only thawed up for the two subsequent analyses. Water as solvent forlong-term storage of RNA may not be optimal, sinceunbuered solutions enhance RNA degradation. This canbe avoided with pH-buered solvents such as Tris-buer, storage of the RNA in precipitated form or reverse transcription of all RNA into cDNA being more stableduring long-term storage. RNA degradation caused byduration of storage most likely occurs at random,resulting in a nondierential error in statistical analyses.Weak associations between gene expression and environ-mental factors may therefore not be detectable anymorein older samples.

We begin with the discussion of allergy-protective factors o f a farming environment. Next we discuss immunological and genetical issues arising from our results and close the first section by addressing major limitations of th e PARSIFAL study. Next, the research questions put forward in Chapter 1 are ans wered in form of short summaries of the main findings. Finally, possible s cientific questions arising from the results of the PARSIFAL study are outlined. VII General Aspects of the Results of the PARSIFAL study VII.I Protective factors of a farming environment A key result of this thesis is that the timing of a n environmental exposure is crucial to exert its effect on the development of atopic di seases. In Chapter 2 and particularly in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 we describe factors exerting their effects during growing and maturing of the child in his or her environment. This is in contrast to the development of atopic sensitisation, which i s mainly influenced by prenatal exposures. In Chapter 2 we reported a significant association between maternal work in stables during pregnancy and decreased production o f allergen-specific IgE antibodies in her child detectable at school age. A lbeit the large sample size of PARSIFAL disentangling pre- and postnatal exposure was difficult because most of the mothers working in stables after birth also wor ked there before. When assessing the time point of the first contact to stable anima ls the strongest effect on occurrence of atopic diseases was observed when the first cont act occurred during pregnancy and decreased when the first contact took place lat er. These results suggest that prenatal environmental exposures affect the long-te rm development of the child's immune system. How the maternal environment exerts its effect on the offspring is unknown. Certain cytokine patterns prevailing in th e maternal organism [119] or diaplacental transfer and interaction with the feta l immune system of the antigen itself [120] might exert the protective effects. One might also speculate that epigenetic inheritance meaning stable alterations (e.g., DNA m ethylation or histone acetylation 86 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli [121], but not mutations of the DNA) is involved in the prenatal protection against atopic sensitisation. Thus, preconceptional exposur e to a farming environment might imprint the parents genetic make-up by epigenetic m eans which in turn are passed on to the offspring. The PARSIFAL study does not pr ovide information on the parental exposure before pregnancy, and therefore w e cannot exclude these preconceptional effects. Future studies are needed to address the question of epigenetic inheritance by collecting appropriate qu estionnaire data and assessing epigenetic changes in the parental, as well as in t he child's genome In Chapter 4 we describe protective effects for ato pic diseases of pig farming, feeding silage, child's involvement in haying, and regular stay in animal sheds and barns, and farm milk consumption in the PARSIFAL st udy. Taken together these factors explained the effect of being a farm child and suggest that protection is not conferred by a single environmental component, but rather several factors contribute to a different extent. There are a few epidemiological studies indicating that consumption of raw cow's milk has a protective effect on the development of atopic diseases (see Chapter 1). PARSIFAL was the first study specifically investiga ting the allergy-protective effect of farm milk consumption. In Chapter 3 we report detai led analyses of the PARSIFAL dietary data and show that the protective effect of farm milk consumption is reproduced in the whole population as well as in th e four study groups suggesting that the effect is not farming specific. The strong est effect was shown for children who drank farm milk during the first year of life a nd who were also currently consuming farm milk, thus were most likely being ex posed to it their whole life. This result favours the assumption that besides the effe ct of farm milk consumption in early life on a child's immune system, drinking far m milk later in life reinforces protection against atopic diseases. At present we c an only speculate about specific components of farm milk that might be responsible f or the observed protective effects. It is conceivable that the microbial burde n of farm milk influences the gut microflora and thus the development of oral toleran ce [122]. Recent animal experiments have shown that colonization of germ-fr ee mice with polysaccharide-A- producing Bacteroides fragilis, a ubiquitous gut mi croorganism and an important Gram-negative anaerobe that colonizes the mammalian lower gastrointestinal tract, restored normal cytokine production and established a proper Th-1/Th-2 balance for General Discussion and Outlook 87 the host [123]. Probiotical treatment for allergy p revention has recently been investigated in several clinical trials which, syst ematically reviewed, showed a beneficial effect on the development of atopic dise ase [124, 125]. However, particularly in ef fects have been observed [126- 129]. Alternatively, farm milk might exert its beneficial effect on the development of atopic diseases by containing nonviable, microbial or nonmicrobial molecules. CD14 is a pattern-recognition receptor of the innate imm une system for a wide spectrum of microbial compounds and nonmicrobial compounds (see Chapter 1). Farm milk is known to contain various bacterial species [130] an d microbial compounds that are able to bind to CD14 after penetrating the intestin al mucosa. Because CD14 is known to be a coreceptor of Toll-like receptors 4 a nd 2 complexes of CD14 and their ligands might bind to one of these pattern-recognit ion receptors on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells and hence activate the imm une system, resulting in subsequent production of immunomodulatory chemokine s and cytokines. Because of the diversified binding properties of CD 14 also non-microbial molecules contained in the farm milk might thus be responsible for the protection against allergic diseases. There is some evidence t hat omega-3 dietary fatty acids are potentially beneficial to patients with allergi c diseases [131, 132]. Thus animal feeding and also milk processing (fat standardizati on, pasteurization, and homogenization) might influence the milk's fat cont ent or fatty acid profile [133, 134]. One might therefore speculate that farm milk differ s from shop-purchased milk regarding its fat amount or composition and subsequ ent intake of higher amounts of omega-3 dietary fatty acids might result in impaire d production of proinflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes [135]. When evaluating the use of farm milk as an allergy- preventive agent, health effects of pathogens in raw milk such as salmonella or enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) have to be carefully consid ered. Particularly, transmission of EHEC through unpasteurized cow's milk continues to cause serious health effects [136] and therefore better knowledge of the protect ive ingredients of raw cow's milk have to be established before using it in a clinica l setting. Future analyses of farm milk compounds responsible for the beneficial effec t have to focus on a better 88 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli characterisation of the consumed milk, e.g., by mea suring fatty acid profiles in addition to microbial compounds. VII.II Imprinting of the innate immune system The availability of biological data, specifically g ene expression of PRR in the PARSIFAL population allowed us to link our epidemio logical observations to transcriptional activity of cells interacting with the innate immune system. In Chapter 2 we showed that prenatal exposure to a farming env ironment influenced gene expression of PRR at school age. Both measures of p renatal exposure, maternal stable work during pregnancy and the number of farm animals the mother had contact with during pregnancy, were significantly a ssociated with increased gene expression of TLR2, TLR4 and CD14. These PRR serve as receptors for a wide spectrum of microbial compounds (see Chapter 1) and it seems likely that the number different animals reflects increasing levels , diversified levels, or both of microbial exposure. TLR4 and CD14 bind specifically LPS, and TLR2 binds fungal cell wall components and it is known that farm acti vities correlate with indoor concentration of LPS and other microbial components [137, 138]. However, we did not observe an association between indoor exposure of these ligands and their respective receptor. Thus, measuring individual com ponents of the microbial environment might reflect a too-narrow spectrum. Expression of PRR was not associated with any healt h outcomes under study. Whether upregulation of PRR primarily reflects a ma rker of exposure or whether higher levels of PRR take an active part in the pat hogenesis of atopic diseases cannot be clarified with the PARSIFAL data. However , experimental data strongly suggest an involvement of PRR activation in the dev elopment of atopic diseases [139-141]. Until quite recently the most accepted m echanistical conception of how microbial exposure exerts its allergy-protective ef fects was the induction of Th1 response that in turn suppresses the allergy -prone Th2 response. The epidemiological observation that the increase in at opic diseases is paralleled by Th1- driven autoimmune diseases [142] and experimental d ata [143] challenges this simple concept of deviation towards a Th1 immune re sponse. Recent research came up with other concepts that might explain the contr adictory results. (i) The identification of Treg, a cell secreting inhib itory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-General Discussion and Outlook 89 , offered an elegant way to explain that a missing suppression of both, the Th1 and Th2 system, might account for exaggerated Th2 immun e responses and thereby development of atopic diseases [144, 145]. (ii) One might also speculate that children, exposed to microbes in the environment, b uild up a network of molecules desensitizing the innate immune system against harm less antigens or antigens in low dose. This network would have the potential to inhi bit an inappropriate adaptive immune response, as it is the case in atopic disord ers. SOCS-1, a potent suppressor of the TLR signaling cascade (see Chapter 1), is in duced in response to microbes and suppresses inflammatory and autoimmune response s in mice [146, 147]. Similar findings in humans were observed in a subanalysis o f the ALEX study: Exposure to LPS was associated with the expression of SOCS-1 th at was in turn inversely associated with the expression of cytokines of adap tive immunity such as IL-5, IFN- and IL-10 suggesting a state of LPS tolerance [148] . Finally, (iii) the cytokine IL-17 of the recently identified TH17 cell line was reported to be increased in the sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and sera from asthmat ics [149] thereby offering another pathogenetic mechanism. VII.III The genes have a say In Chapter 5 we report a gene-environment interacti on between a polymorphism in the CD14 gene ( CD14/A-1721G ) and farm milk consumption in the first year of li fe on atopic health outcomes in two independent popula tions. In unstratified analyses farm milk consumption had no effect on gene express ion, highlighting the venture of missing relevant signals that are masked by genetic variation in epidemiological studies. In our population the well-characterized f unctional promoter polymorphism in CD14/C-260T (see Chapter 1) was in high linkage disequilibrium with CD14/A- 1721G , therefore results for the associations between fa rm milk and the phenotypes studied were similar in both SNPs, although less he terogeneous across the genotypes of CD14/A-1721G . However, we can not exclude the possibility that polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with CD14/A-1721G underlie our findings. Moreover, the power of our study population was too limited too conduct haplotype analyses. Effects of combinations of different SNPs in the CD14 gene might be more distinct than effects of the individual SNPs. 90 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli Variations in genotypes of CD14/A-1721G not only interacted with the effect of farm milk consumption on clinical outcomes but also on gene expression of CD14. Several mechanisms for how the genotype could influ ence the phenotype are possible. Mutations in the coding region may modify the structure and thus the function of the protein. CD14/A-1721G is located in the promoter region of the CD14 gene and thus rather affects gene expression and, i n turn, the amount of the translated protein. However, neither farm milk consumption nor one of t he CD14/A-1721G genotypes was directly associated with gene expression of CD1 4. An association between the CD14/A-1721G polymorphism and CD14 gene expression became evide nt only on exposure to farm milk consumption. We speculate tha t subjects with higher expression of CD14 produce higher levels of the CD1 4 protein and may therefore be more susceptible to further stimulation by farm mil k-associated agents. However, investigation of the transcriptional activity of th e genetic variations of CD14/A-1721G and its function are needed. VII.IV Limitations The results of this thesis have to be interpreted i n the light of three serious limitations of the PARSIFAL study: The cross-sectio nal design, the lack of biological data regarding the composition of farm milk, and th e limited power to for genetical analyses. Results of a cross-sectional study do not allow con clusions to be drawn regarding the temporal sequence and therefore causal relation ships between events, although multiple regression techniques may allow disentangl ing temporality to a certain extent. A temporal relationship can only be address ed adequately in longitudinal studies which generally are financially extensive a nd time-consuming. In turn, cross- sectional studies offer the possibility to study re search questions with moderate expenses in time and money. Studies like PARSIFAL s tand out by their hypotheses generating, rather than hypotheses proving potentia l. Furthermore, cross-sectional studies are prone for the occurrence recall bias, m eaning that e.g. mothers from atopic children tend to recall past exposures bette r than mothers of healthy children. Objective measurements, such as gene expression mea surement, genotyping, and General Discussion and Outlook 91 measurement of allergen-specific IgE, however, are not known to the parents and therefore the results are unlikely to be biased by recall. Moreover, the results of this thesis are limited by the lack of biological data regarding milk composition. Therefore, the underlyi ng mechanisms of the allergy- preventive effect of farm milk consumption remain s peculative. Finally, we are aware that the sample size was low to study gene-environment interactions. We do, however, believe that similar trends in the majority of the health outcome measures in the two independent study popul ations strongly suggest that the results have not only emerged because of chance . VIII Summary of the Main Findings Environmental factors and expression of innate immu nity genes 1. Can the results of the ALEX study [50] be confir med in the PARSIFAL data? We could reproduce the observation in a small sub-s ample of the ALEX population that children raised on a farm express h igher amounts of PRR. In PARSIFAL gene expression of CD14, TLR2 and, in cont rast to ALEX, TLR4 were higher in farmers' children compared to non-farmers ' children. 2. Are the levels of microbial compounds in house d ust associated with the expression of genes of the innate immune system? We determined levels of LPS and EPS levels in house dust collected from the living room and from the child's mattress. Gene exp ression of both, the TLR4 ligand and the TLR2 ligand EPS, were not correlated wi th gene expression of their respective receptor in neither the living room nor the mattress dust samples. 3. Is the protective effect of farm milk consumptio n that has been shown in the ALEX study reproducible in the PARSIFAL study and is it at least partly explained by differential gene expression of PRR? We were able to reproduce the protective effect of farm milk consumption in the larger PARSIFAL study independently of potential co nfounders as shown in multiple 92 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli regression models. Of particular importance is the consistency of the findings across children from farming, rural non-farming, anthropos ophic, and suburban environments indicating that farm milk consumption represents a route of exposure that is independent of concomitant exposures to mic robial compounds present in animal sheds and farms houses. The inverse associat ion was not explained by concurrent farm activities of the child or farm exp osures during pregnancy and was most pronounced in children drinking farm milk sinc e their first year of life. In addition, we describe a genetic polymorphism in the CD14 gene that modifies the effect of farm milk consumption on both, the de velopment of atopic diseases and gene expression of CD14. However, we did not observ e a direct association between farm milk consumption and the gene expression of ne ither CD14, nor TLR2 and TLR4. 4. Which other specific factors of farming lifestyl e have an impact on the expression of PRR of the innate immune system? 5. Is there a window of age where potential benefic ial factors take effect? Expression of PRR was higher in children when the m other worked on the farm during pregnancy. This association remained even af ter adjustment for other farm- related factors and potential confounders in multip le regression models. In addition, we observed a dose-dependent increase in gene expre ssion of CD14, TLR2 and TLR4 with the number of farm animal species the mot her had contact with during pregnancy, which probably serves as proxy for an in creasing variation in microbial exposure. Interestingly, prenatal factors also exert their ef fect on the child's health later in life. Children of mothers who worked on the farm du ring pregnancy were less sensitised at school age to common inhalant and foo d allergens than children of unexposed mothers. Other farm-related exposures did not confound this relationship. However, the development of clinical symptoms of at opic diseases seemed to depend on exposures that occurred postnatally. Thus , children currently exposed to a farming environment (defined as barn or stable visi ts or helping with haying at least on a weekly basis) had fewer symptoms of allergic r hinoconjuntivitis, whereas farm General Discussion and Outlook 93 milk consumption and regular contact with farm anim als were inversely associated with the diagnosis of asthma. DNA polymorphisms, TLR expression and environmental factors 6. To what extent do polymorphisms of genes encodin g for PRR modify the respective expression of PRR? 7. Does such a relation depend on environmental fac tors (gene-environment interaction) most notably the factors known to be p rotective regarding atopic diseases? Neither of the genotyped SNPs was directly associat ed with differential gene expression. However, a polymorphism in the CD14 gen e ( CD14/A-1721G ) significantly modified the effect of farm milk cons umption on CD14 gene expression. Farm milk-drinking children homozygous for the A al lele expressed significantly more CD14 than non-exposed children. No association betw een farm milk drinking was observed in children with the GG genotype; heterozy gous children showed an intermediate difference in CD14 gene expression bet ween exposed and non- exposed children. In unstratified analyses farm mil k consumption had no effect on gene expression. Interestingly, we observed the sam e interaction between genotypes of CD14/A-1721G and farm milk exposure on asthma and related atopi c health outcomes. Moreover, we were able to replicate the g ene-environment interaction on atopic health outcomes in two independent populatio ns: the PARSIFAL and the ALEX population. Gene expression in the epidemiological study settin g 8. Are there qualitative differences of the gene ex pression results between studies using different methodological approaches? 9. Which pitfalls have to be accounted for when doi ng gene expression measurements in epidemiological studies? In PARSIFAL as well as in the longitudinal PASTURE study gene expression was measured to investigate environmental influences on the innate immune system. 94 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli However, there were some methodological differences between the two studies: In PARSIFAL blood was collected in EDTA tubes, whereas tubes containing an RNA- stabilizing solution were used in PASTURE. Using th ese different tubes had a marked impact on the amount of RNA that could be ex tracted from the blood samples: In PASTURE larger amounts of RNA could be extracted resulting in smaller proportions of samples that could not be used for f urther analyses. We also observed less heterogeneity in terms of extracted RNA amount s between study centres. Using RNA stabilizing tubes is therefore preferable for m aintaining the quality of blood samples, particularly in logistically extensive, ep idemiological studies. Furthermore, the PARSIFAL samples have been stored with water as a solvent. We found decreasing agreement between samples repeatedly mea sured, suggesting RNA degradation over time. Thus, particularly in longit udinal studies, other solvents than water have to be considered for long-term storage o f RNA samples. IX What Scientific Questions Arise from these Resul ts IX.I Further studies: Large and longitudinal For a better characterisation of the allergy-protec tive compounds contained in the farming environment, as well as identification of s usceptibility genes for atopic diseases, large-scale epidemiological studies are n eeded that provide enough power to detect effects also in small subsets of a popula tion. An ongoing project, the cross- sectional GABRIEL study taking place in Austria, Ge rmany, Poland, and Switzerland, recruited about 100,000 children from farming and n on-farming families for a close investigation of genetic and environmental factors and their role in the development of atopic diseases [150]. This large population wit h well-characterised sub-samples by means of environmental (dust samples and milk sa mples), clinical (measurement of bronchial hyperresponsivness) and biological (ge ne expression, genotyping and specific IgE) data promises novel results regarding the identification allergy- protective factors of a farming environment. A clos e investigation of the relevance of farm milk consumption in the development of atopic disorders will be possible as data of processing (skimming, heating) or storage time o f the milk consumed by the children will be available. General Discussion and Outlook 95 As pointed out in section VII.IV the cross-sectiona l design of the PARSIFAL study limits the informative value of our results regardi ng the causal relationship between exposure and outcome. Thus, longitudinal studies he lp us to gather information on the temporal sequence and thereby allowing causal i nference. The ongoing PASTURE cohort consists of about 1000 children from five European countries (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, and Switzerland ). Each country built a birth cohort of about 100 farmers' and 100 non-farmers' c hildren [151]. Several detailed questionnaires were completed during pregnancy and after birth of the child referring to the health of the child and the family and inten sity and timing of farm-related exposures of the child and the mother. Cord blood a nd blood samples at one year of life were collected for measurements of specific Ig E, as well as for genotyping and measurement of gene expression of innate immunity g enes. Furthermore, the children will be followed up to the age of 6 years, and beyond. This data will allow the investigators to evaluate prenatal factors affectin g the child's immunological and health status at birth and later in life. Furthermo re, exposure data will be collected close to the time point when the child was actually exposed and before manifestation of disease, thereby limiting recall bias. It would be desirable to follow up this cohort until school age when most atopic disorders have al ready become manifest. IX.II The magic of raw cow's milk Analyses of milk samples of an ongoing birth cohort study in rural areas of Europe (PASTURE) indicate that LPS levels are similar or e ven lower in milk consumed by farmers' than in milk consumed by non-farmers' fami lies [152]. There, higher levels of LPS in the milk of non-farming families could be la rgely explained by storage time before consumption and thereby most likely results from recontamination. This study challenges the role of gram-negative microorganisms for the protective farm milk effect. Though, since it is known that the microbia l spectrum of recontaminated cow's milk is dominated by Gram-negative bacteria and ess entially differs from fresh, unprocessed milk [153, 154], LPS might not be the d ecisive compound reflecting the microbial load conferring beneficial, immunomodulat ory effects on the child's health. In the GABRIEL study questionnaire data regarding m ilk processing and also storage time, as well as biological data of farm mi lk is available. Along with the large sample size a closer investigation of the effect of farm milk consumption on atopic 96 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli health outcomes is possible. Farm milk can be proce ssed in multiple ways. Each processing step has different influences on the com position of the milk. Whereas skimming might affect the lipid profile and bioavai lability of fatty acids, heating of the milk might change the microbial content as a functi on of the extent and duration of heating. These factors will be investigated in the large GABRIEL population as it provides enough power for subgroup analyses. In a s ub-sample of the GABRIEL population shop and farm milk samples are collected directly from the child's home. These samples very closely represent what kind of m ilk the child is actually drinking and extensive analyses of these samples regarding c omposition, particularly fat content and profile, and microbial contamination wi ll be conducted. An accurate characterisation of the farm milk and recognition o f the differences compared to the milk bought in the shop will bring us closer to the potential components that confer protection against atopic diseases and might offer the opportunity to develop a product safe enough to investigate in clinical tria ls. IX.III A closer look at genetics The achievements in genetics of atopic diseases app ear impressive. In a little over 10 years, many susceptibility genes have been identified as robust candidates, and the list keeps growing longer. However, conflic ting results and recognition of the complexity of genetics in diseases like asthma and allergy, raised as many questions as it answered. There is hope that genome-wide association (GWA) st udies, if adequately designed and powered to detect gene-environment int eractions, may prove to be effective tools, taking us closer to a comprehensiv e set of allergy genes. In 2007 the first GWA study for an allergy trait (childhood ast hma) was published [155]. GWA studies rely on dense sets of SNPs across the genom e to survey the most common genetic variants for a role in disease or to identi fy the heritable quantitative traits that are risk factors for disease [156]. The availabilit y of dense genotyping chips, containing sets of thousands of SNPs that provide g ood coverage of much of the human genome, means that for the first time GWA stu dies for thousands of cases and controls are technically and financially feasib le. The main strength of GWA studies is expected to lie in their ability to disc over truly novel disease candidate genes, especially those associated with moderate ri sks [92]. General Discussion and Outlook 97 The GABRIEL population provides an optimal framewor k in which GWA studies can be conducted. Indeed, genetic analyses in this population are ongoing and the first results are eagerly anticipated. The genes di scovered through genome-wide approaches in analyses stratified by exposure level will also indirectly help to narrow the search for biologically active substances inter acting with the products of the identified genes and thus might be an important ste p forward on the way to successful prevention of atopic diseases. IX.IV Immunological data: A challenge for bioinform atics Most important experimental data has to provide the biological and mechanistic knowledge to understand which immunological pathway s are involved in the associations observed in epidemiological studies. T he CD14/-C1721T SNP (Chapter 5) similarly modifies the effect of early farm milk consumption on atopic diseases and gene expression of CD14, strongly suggesting that t he health effect is mediated by differential transcriptional activity among the gen otypes. However, functional studies in cell lines or animals have to prove this hypothe sis. Our data and literature from experimental data (rev iewed in [69]) suggest that the innate immune system plays a crucial role how micro bial or even other environmental compounds exert their effect on the development of atopic diseases. The emergence of high-throughput genomic technologies allow large -scale gene expression profiles to be measured in a time-efficient way and these me thodological advances have spread the range of potential applications and allo w gene expression analyses to be used in the context of epidemiological studies (we report technical pitfalls and potential workarounds in Chapter 6). However, the e normous amounts of data these techniques generate create challenges in bioinforma tics, e.g., how to identify true positive results (keyword \"multiple testing\") or ho w to model complex immunological pathways by statistical means. Sophisticated statis tical methods are available nowadays but scarcely used in immunological researc h [157]. Structural equation models (SEM) can handle multiple relationships amon g study variables [158] and are therefore eligible to deal with the complexity of i mmunological processes and their relationship with exposure and health outcome [157] . Using this kind of approach to analyze complex data in the context of gene express ion measurements in 98 Hygiene hypothesis and innate immunity - Thesis of Christian Bieli epidemiological studies might offer the opportunity to get a deeper insight into the biological mechanisms of the observed associations. IX.V Clinical applications: From population to pati ent One aim of epidemiological research is generating h ypothesis that in turn have to be further investigated in experimental studies. Ho wever, the final goal is to come up with new therapeutical or preventive strategies tha t finally help patients by ameliorating or even preventing the manifestation o f their disease. In the context of atopic diseases, aiming for the latter appears real istic since potential environmental factors were found that might prevent allergic diso rders. Vaccination-like therapeutic challenge of the innate immune system by pharmacolo gically targeting PRR is one possibility and experimental studies are ongoing, e .g., application of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 ligands reduced the degree of allergic ast hma through reduction of inflammation, total serum IgE and number of T helpe r cells in the lung in mice [69, 159]. Particularly for asthma, the use of CpG (cyto sine-guanine) oligodeoxynucleotides contained in bacterial DNA pr omises to be a potential agent for prevention and therapy [160]. Furthermore, prom ising clinical studies with probiotic microbes are ongoing. Probiotic microbes are living microorganisms culturing the gut and thereby providing a beneficia l stimulus to the innate immune system. Prenatal administration of probiotic microb es to children had preventive effects on atopic diseases at least until the age o f 4 years in a Finnish trial [161] and other studies reported similar results (systematica lly reviewed in [125]). In the context of our results, so far unidentified compounds contained in farm milk evolve as potential preventive measures for atopic diseases. The results presented in this thesis might add to evidence of the farm milk' s beneficial effects and motivate future investigations, so that clinical trials expo sing children to fresh cow's milk or its beneficial ingredients one day might come true.
