The Short-Term Persistence Substudy (STPS) was initiated after the SPS to further assess the persistence of vaccine ef cacy. Methods .The STPS re-enrolled 7320 vaccine and 6950 recipients from the 38 546 -subject SPS popula- tion. Methods of surveillance, case determination, and follow-up were analogous to those in the SPS. Vaccine ef cacy for herpes zoster (HZ) burden of incidence of HZ were as- sessed for the STPS population, for the combined SPS and STPS populations, and for each year through year 7 aftervaccination. Results .In the STPS as compared to the SPS, vaccine ef cacy for HZ burden of illness decreased from 61.1% to 50.1%, vaccine ef cacy for the incidence of decreased from 66.5% 60.1%, and vaccine ef of HZ decreased from 51.3% to 39.6%, although the differences were not statistically signi cant. Analysis of vaccine ef cacy in each year after vaccination for all 3 outcomes showed a decrease in vaccine ef cacy after year 1, with a further decline thereafter. Vaccine ef cacy was statistically signi cant for the incidence of HZ and the HZ burden of illness through year 5. Conclusions .Vaccine ef cacy for each study outcome was lower in the STPS than in the SPS. There is evidence of the persistence of vaccine ef cacy through year 5 after vaccination but, vaccine ef cacy is uncertain beyond that point.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Coop- erative Study 403: The Shingles Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ef ca- cy trial of live attenuated Oka/Merck HZ vaccine (zoster vaccine) in 38 546 adults 60 years of age. The Shingles Prevention Study demonstrated that zoster vaccine reduced the HZ burden of illness by 61.1% con of HZ by 51.3% (95% CI, 44.2 -57.6) through 4 postvaccina- tion follow-up [ 2-4].Received 11 April 2012; accepted 9 July 2012; electronically published 24 July 2012.

The Short-Term Persistence Substudy also pro-vided a cohort of the original Shingles Prevention Studyvaccine recipients who could subsequently be enrolled in along-term persistence substudy to further assess the persis- tence of vaccine ef cacy. In addition, data on the persistence of vaccine ef cacy for each year after vaccination in the Shin- gles Prevention Study have not been published. Therefore, theobjectives of this article are to assess the persistence of vaccine efcacy for the 3 study end points in the Short-Term Persis- tence Substudy population, the Shingles Prevention Study population, and the combined Shingles Prevention Study and Short-Term Persistence Substudy populations and to assessthe persistence of vaccine ef cacy for the 3 study end points for each year through year 7 after subjects received zoster vaccine or placebo in the Shingles Prevention Study. METHODS Study Design and Time Line The Shingles Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial initiated in November 1998 [ 2]. All vaccine and placebo recipients were actively followed fornew cases of HZ through September 2003. There was a break insurveillance for cases of HZ of approximately 15 months between the completion of the Shingles Prevention Study sur- veillance in September 2003 and resumption of follow-up inthe Short-Term Persistence Substudy in December 2004. Beginning in October 2005, open-label zoster vaccine was offered without charge to Shingles Prevention Study placeborecipients. Placebo recipients enrolled in the Short-Term Per-sistence Substudy completed the study upon receiving zoster vaccine, since they could then no longer serve as unvaccinated controls. The Short-Term Persistence Substudy subjects whowere zoster vaccine recipients in the Shingles Prevention Study continued to be followed until the initiation of the Long-Term Persistence Substudy in March 2006. Study Population and Sites Participation in the Short-Term Persistence Substudy waslimited by funding constraints to 12 of 22 original Shingles Prevention Study sites, with preference given to sites that had high enrollment. A telephone-based consent procedure toenroll subjects into the Short-Term Persistence Substudy was approved by the VA Cooperative Studies Program, theCooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center 's Human Rights Committee, and local institutional review boards. In- clusion and exclusion criteria were the same as in the ShinglesPrevention Study except that subjects who had previously re- ceived zoster vaccine on enrollment into the Shingles Preven- tion Study were not excluded. With 12 participating sites, wesought to enroll 15 000 -20 000 subjects. Follow-up Active follow-up with surveillance for new cases of HZ was the same as in the Shingles Prevention Study. As in the Shin- gles Prevention Study, the threshold for evaluating suspectedcases of HZ was set very low, to ensure \"capture \"of any mild, atypical, or vaccine-modi ed cases of HZ. HZ Case Determination and End Point Measurements Methods for evaluation of suspected cases of HZ, for diagnosisand management of cases of HZ, for measurement of HZ-associated pain and discomfort, and for determination of evaluable cases were the same as those used in the Shingles Prevention Study [ 2-6]. The only change from the Shingles Prevention Study was to reduce the frequency of contacts after week 4 from weekly to monthly. The burden of illness for each case of HZ (ie, the HZ severity of illness score) wasdened as the area under the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory worst pain and discomfort severity-by-duration curve. TheHZ burden of illness was dened as the sum of all of the HZseverity of illness scores in the group (eg, placebo recipients 70 years of age) divided by the person-years of observation. Subjects who did not develop HZ during the period of obser- vation were assigned an HZ severity of illness score of 0. Statistical Methods The de nition of HZ burden of illness and methods for calcu- lating vaccine ef cacy for study outcomes have been published elsewhere [ 2-5,7]. The analysis of the incidence of posther- petic neuralgia and of HZ assumed a Poisson distribution for events and used a conditional exact method for calculating rates [ 8-10]. Data management and statistical programming were performed using SAS software [ 11], with exact CIs calcu- lated using StatXact [ 12]. Vaccine ef of illness, incidence of postherpetic neuralgia, and incidence ofHZ were determined for the entire Short-Term PersistenceSubstudy period (primary analysis) and for the combined population from the Shingles Prevention Study and Short- Term Persistence Substudy (secondary analyses). Analyseswere strati ed by age at time of randomization in the Shingles Prevention Study into the 2 prespeci ed age groups: 60 -69 years and 70 years. To calculate the vaccine ef cacy for inci- dent HZ during a speci c year after vaccination and age stratum, the number of HZ cases occurring within that year Persistence of Zoster Vaccine Ef cacy \u0081CID 2012:55 number of person-years of follow-up for subjects in that year were determined for each treatment group, and vaccine ef cacy was estimated as 1 -[(incidence of HZ among of HZ among ents)]. ef cacy for incidence of PHN and for HZ burden of illness were calculated similarly. The Shingles Pre- vention Study and Short-Term Persistence Substudy popula- tions were pooled by adding the number of HZ cases and the number of person-years of follow-up from the 2 studies for theoverall calculation and were also calculated for each year aftervaccination for the by-year postvaccination analysis. Results are presented as point estimates of event outcomes and as vaccine ef cacies with 95% CIs. Follow-up time for the Short- Term Persistence Substudy subjects did not include the interval between 30 September 2003 (when surveillance for new casesof HZ ceased in the Shingles Prevention Study) and their dateof enrollment in the Short-Term Persistence Substudy, since HZ cases occurring during this gap in follow-up were not re-portable and could not be validated according to study criteria. However, any Shingles Prevention Study subjects reporting that they experienced HZ during this gap in follow-up werenot eligible to enroll in the Short-Term Persistence Substudy. RESULTS Study Subjects Among the 12 sites, 21 198 (90.5%) of all subjects enrolled in the Shingles Prevention Study were screened for enrollment in the Short-Term Persistence Study over a 9-month period, nearly all by telephone-based interview. Of those screened, 14 270 (67.3%) Figure 1. Participant characteristics and flow through the Short-Term Persistence Substudy (STPS).aReasons are not mutually exclusive (ie, subjects may have had >1 reason for not enrolling in the STPS).bA total of 6546 subjects enrolled in the STPS agreed to enroll in the Long-Term Persistence Substudy (LTPS), and 520 enrolled in the STPS completed follow-up and a closeout interview but did not enroll in the LTPS.cA total of 6194 subjects received zoster vaccine in the STPS, at which time they completed a closeout interview, and follow-up in the STPS was terminated; and 617 were followed until they were offered but refused zoster vaccine, at which time they completed a closeout interview, and follow-up in STPS was terminated.Abbreviations: \u0081CID (15 November) \u0081Schmader et al(7320 vaccine recipients and 6950 placebo recipients) were enrolled in the Short-Term Persistence Substudy (Figure 1). The main reasons for subjects not enrolling were as follows: sub- jects declined participation (29.9%), subjects were considered unlikely to adhere to the protocol (7.8%), and subjects had a history of HZ occurring in the Shingles Prevention Study (4.2%;3.2% of vaccine recipients and 5.1% of placebo recipients) (Figure 1). Except for history of HZ, other reasons for not enroll- ing in the STPS were comparable for the vaccine and placebo recipients. Subjects who enrolled in the Short-Term PersistenceSubstudy were younger when they enrolled into the Shingles Pre- vention Study than the subjects who did not enroll in the Short- Term Persistence Substudy (mean age, 68.6 years vs 70.6 years). The mean age at time of enrollment into the Short-Term Persistence Substudy was 73.3 years for the vaccine andplacebo recipients. There were no signi cant differences in race, sex, and general health status at the time of enrollment into the Shingles Prevention Study between the vaccine and placebo groups (data were not recorded at onset of the Short-Term Persistence Substudy). Surveillance and Follow-up of Cases of HZ in the Short-Term Persistence Substudy The vaccine recipients accrued more years of follow-up than the placebo recipients in the Short-Term Persistence Substudy (9967 years vs 6802 years) because of attrition among the placebo recipients due to administration of zoster vaccine tothe Shingles Prevention Study placebo recipients. The mean follow-up time (\u00b1SD) was 0.98 \u00b1 ents 0.29 years for the vaccine recipients. Morethan 96% of the zoster vaccine recipients and 98% of theplacebo recipients completed closeout interviews (Figure 1). A total of 703 rashes were evaluated during the 27 months of the Short-Term Persistence Substudy (with approximately 17 000person-years of follow-up); 300 in the placebo group and 403 in the vaccine group. Of these rashes, 231 were clinically diagnosed by site investigators as suspected cases of HZ; 118 were in theplacebo group, 113 were in the zoster vaccine group. Of the 113 subjects with suspected cases of HZ in the HZ vaccine group, 84 (74.3%) had evaluable cases of HZ. Of the 118 subjects with sus-pected cases of HZ in the placebo group, 95 (80.5%) had evalu- able cases of HZ. HZ case determinations were made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for 168 subjects, by localvirus culture for 1 subject, and by clinical events committee adju-dication for 10 subjects for whom diagnostic specimens for PCR a s s a yw e r en o ta v a i l a b l eo rw e r ei n a d e q u a t e .T h eO k av a c c i n e strain of VZV was not identi ed in any specimen. Safety Monitoring No serious adverse events occurred during the Short-Term Persistence Substudy that were judged possibly, probably, ordenitely related to the vaccination. There was no signi cant difference in deaths between placebo recipients (1.12 deaths/ 100 person-years) and zoster vaccine recipients Short-Term Persistence Substudy Population The incidence of HZ in the zoster vaccine group was 8.4 cases/1000 person-years, compared with 14.0 cases/1000 person-years in the placebo group, and the incidence of PHN was 0.70and 1.76 cases/1000 person-years, respectively (Table 1). Vaccine ef cacy for the 3 outcome measures was 50.1% (95% CI, 14.1 -71.0) for the HZ burden of illness, 60.1% (95% CI, 9.8 to 86.7) for the incidence of PHN, and 39.6% (95% CI, 18.2 -55.5) for incidence of HZ (Table 2). The vaccine ef cacy for the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia showed the largesttreatment effect but was derived from only 19 cases of PHN, and thus the lower boundary of the 95% CI does not exclude 0. Vaccine Ef cacy in the Combined Short-Term Persistence Substudy and Shingles Prevention Study Populations Surveillance in the Shingles Prevention Study primarily covered years 1 -4 after vaccination, whereas surveillance in the Short-Term Persistence Substudy primarily covered years 5-7 after vaccination. Combining the Shingles Prevention Study and Short-Term Persistence Substudy increased the sur- veillance time in the zoster vaccine group by 17.1% (58 203 person-years in the Shingles Prevention Study plus 9967 person-years in the Short-Term Persistence Substudy) and by11.8% in placebo group (57 736 person-years in the Shin- gles Prevention Study plus 6802 in the Short- Term Persistence Substudy). Vaccine ef cacy for the combined study results for the 3 outcome measures was 58.6% (95% CI,48.6 -66.6) for the CI, 47.4 - 77.0) the and 48.7% (95% CI, 42.0 - 54.7) for the incidence of HZ (Table 2). Vaccine Ef cacy for Each Year After Vaccination In the Shingles Prevention Study population, vaccine ef cacy for the HZ burden of illness and vaccine dence of >0 for each year of follow-up through year 4 after vaccination (Table 2and Figure 2A-C). Point estimates for vaccine ef cacy for the incidence of PHN showed persistence of the vaccine effect, but these were notsignicant after year 2 within a given year because of the small number of cases of postherpetic neuralgia. Vaccine ef - cacy was greatest in the rst year after vaccination for all 3 outcome measures. The vaccine ef cacy for the HZ burden of illness declined from 79.2% in year 1 to 54.9% and 44.4% inyears 2 and 3, respectively, but increased to 66.9% in year4. The vaccine ef cacy for the incidence of postherpetic neu- ralgia declined from 83.4% in year 1 to 69.8% in year 2.

For years 1, 2, and 3, 100% of person-years of follow-up were from SPS subjects. For year 4, 97% of person-years of follow-up were from SPS subjects, and 3% were from STPS subjects. For year 5, 16% of person-years of follow-up were from SPS subjects, and 84% were from STPS subjects. For years 6 and 7, 100% of person-years of follow-up were from STPS subjects. bYear 7 includes a small number of events and person-years of follow-up from year 8 (111.5 person-years for the zoster vaccine group and 13.3 person-years of follow-up for the placebo group). 1324 \u0081CID 2012:55 (15 November) \u0081Schmader et al vaccine ef cacy for the incidence of HZ declined from 62.0% in year 1 to 48.9%, 46.8%, and 44.6% in years 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Analysis of the combined Shingles Prevention Study and the Short-Term Persistence Substudy populations permitted an assessment of vaccine ef cacy through 5 years after vacci- nation (Figure 2). Vaccine ef cacy for the HZ burden of illness and for the incidence of PHN were both greater in year5 than in year 4. However, the CIs for these 1-year interval estimates are wide, and thus the change in vaccine ef cacy is not statistically signi cant. Vaccine ef cacy on the incidence of HZ for year 5 (43.1%) was similar to that for year 4 (44.6%). In the Short-Term Persistence Substudy population, results for year 6 show reductions in the point estimates for all 3 out- comes, but the CIs are wide. Year 6 results show a low point in vaccine ef cacy for all 3 outcomes, with wide CIs (Figure 2) that are due to an increase in incidence of HZ among vaccinerecipients and a decrease in the incidence of postherpetic neu- ralgia among placebo recipients followed in year 6 after vacci- nation (Figure 3). DISCUSSION Zoster vaccine reduced the HZ burden of illness by 50%, the incidence of PHN by 60%, and the incidence of HZ by nearly 40%, compared with placebo, in the Short-Term PersistenceSubstudy population evaluated from 3.3 -7.8 years after vacci- nation. Compared with the Shingles Prevention Study popula- tion, vaccine ef cacy in the Short-Term Persistence Substudy was 11.0 percentage points lower for the HZ burden of illness,6.4 percentage points lower for the incidence of PHN, and 11.7 percentage points lower for the incidence of HZ. When the Shingles Prevention Study and Short-Term PersistenceSubstudy populations were combined, zoster vaccine reduced the HZ burden of illness by nearly 59%, the incidence of PHN by 65%, and the incidence of HZ by >48%, compared withplacebo. These results suggest that the zoster vaccine continues to have bene t, albeit with a declining magnitude, beyond the median follow-up time of 3.1 years in the SPS. When the data were analyzed for vaccine ef cacy for each year from year 1 through year 7 after vaccination in the com- bined Shingles Prevention Study and Short-Term PersistenceSubstudy populations, the ef cacy of zoster vaccine for the HZ burden of illness and the incidence of HZ were statistically sig- nicant for each year through the end of year 5. The point esti- mates for year 6 and year 7 suggested continued ef cacy for the HZ burden of illness and incidence of HZ, but the resultswere not statistically signi cant, except for the HZ burden of illness in year 7. The small number of cases in the later years reduced the power to detect true differences. The ef cacy of zoster vaccine for the incidence of PHN also appeared topersist, but because of the small number of cases of PHN,Table 2.

For year 4, 97% of person-years of follow-up were from SPS subjects, and 3% were from STPS subjects. For year 5, 16% of person-years of follow-up were from SPS subjects, and 84% were from STPS subjects. For years 6 and 7, 100% of person-years of follow-up were from STPS subjects. bYear 7 includes a small number of person-years of follow-up from year 8 (111.5 person-years of follow-up for the zoster vaccine group and 13.3 person-years of follow-up for the placebo group). Persistence of Zoster \u0081CID 2012:55 (15 the incidence of PHN was not statistically signicant beyond 2 years after vaccination. The analysis of change in vaccine ef cacy for each year after vaccinationshowed a decrease in ef cacy after the rst year for all 3 study outcomes, indicating that protection wanes to some degree after 1 year. The greatest decline in vaccine ef cacy was Figure 2. Estimates of zoster vaccine ef cacy in the combined Shingles Prevention Study and Short-Term Persistence Substudy populations.

In the SPS, the inci- dence of HZ was the outcome most impacted by the increasing age, where vaccine ef cacy against new cases of HZ was signi - cantly lower for subjects aged 70 years, compared with sub- jects aged 60 -69 years (37.6% vs 63.9%) [ 2]. The results of the Long-Term Persistence Substudy should help to determine whether the vaccine provides protection beyond the period in-vestigated this study and thus the need for booster vaccination. The comparable mortality rates observed among vaccine and placebo recipients in the Short-Term Persistence Substudyand the absence of vaccine-related adverse events supports thelong-term safety of zoster vaccine [ 2,11]. Study limitations are important to note. The selection of the Short-Term Persistence Substudy population was limitedby resources, permitting the inclusion of only 12 of 22 original Shingles Prevention Study sites. In addition, a delay in approv- al of the Short-Term Persistence Substudy until after the Shin-gles Prevention Study was closed led to a gap in surveillancefor HZ between the end of the Shingles Prevention Study and the initiation of the Short-Term Persistence Substudy. This in- terval and any events that might have occurred betweenstudies were excluded from all analyses. However, the Short- Term Persistence Substudy successfully enrolled >14 000 sub- jects. Similar eligibility criteria were used to enroll subjects inthe Short-Term Persistence Substudy, and, other than enroll- ing an older population, there were no differences in subject characteristics between the Shingles Prevention Study and theShort-Term Persistence Substudy. If censoring due to vaccina- tion introduced a bias that increased the incidence of HZ among the remaining placebo recipients, the incidence of HZwould have been expected to be higher in year 7 than in years5 and 6 (Figure 3) and higher during the period when most vaccinations were occurring (ie, January 2005 -June 2007), but the observed rates are lower or similar for those periods rela-tive to earlier intervals. In conclusion, zoster vaccine continued to reduce the HZ burden of illness, the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia, andthe incidence of HZ in the Short-Term Persistence Substudy population. Vaccine ef cacy for each study outcome was lower in the Short-Term Persistence Substudy than in the Shingles Prevention Study. The duration of zoster vaccine ef cacy is not known beyond 5 years after vaccination. The Long-TermPersistence Substudy, currently being analyzed, may provideadditional data on the duration of zoster vaccine ef cacy. Notes Acknowledgments.
