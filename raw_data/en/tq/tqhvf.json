(3) If the licensing authority imposes a condition in respect of a UK marketing authorisation for a medicinal product of a kind mentioned in paragraph (2)(d), it must, in imposing that condition, specify a period of time for the duration of the condition. (4) The appropriate authority must complete its examination of the sample for testing, the appropriate documentation or both (as the case may be) within the period of 60 days, beginning with the date on which the appropriate authority is in receipt of both the sample for testing, and the appropriate documentation. (5) The appropriate authority must publish a list, to be known as the approved country list for batch testing and certification of biological medicinal products, specifying the countries that are approved for the purposes of the appropriate authority's assessment under paragraph (6) and regulation 60B(5). (6) Where a holder of a UK marketing authorisation, in order to comply with the batch testing condition, submits appropriate documentation that includes a certificate issued by a laboratory in an approved country for batch testing and certification of biological medicinal products in respect of the batch, the appropriate authority must, in addition to any other factors it considers relevant, take that into account in determining whether the appropriate authority needs to undertake any further testing of the medicinal product submitted to it. (7) In order to determine whether a country should be included in the approved country list for batch testing and certification of biological medicinal products, the appropriate authority may, in particular, take into account whether the relevant certification process in that country is based on testing performed under a quality assurance system that undergoes regular external assessment to ensure it meets an appropriate standard of competence for testing biological medicines. (8) The appropriate authority must\u2014 (a)review the countries it has included in the approved country list for batch testing and certification of biological medicinal products to determine if it is still satisfied that the country should remain on that list, and if it is not so satisfied, remove that country from the list; and (b)undertake that review at least every three years beginning with the date on which that country is included in the list. (9) The appropriate authority must\u2014 (a)publish a list of countries, or organisations, with whom the United Kingdom has an agreement for the purposes of the application of the batch testing exemption under this regulation or regulation 60B; (b)include in that list any conditions or restrictions in that agreement that affect the applicability of the batch testing exemption under this regulation or regulation 60B; and (c)update that list as soon as reasonably practicable if\u2014 (i)the United Kingdom no longer has an agreement with a country or organisation included in the list, (ii)any such agreement is amended, or (iii)the United Kingdom enters in to a new agreement with a country or organisation.

(11) Paragraph (12) applies where the appropriate authority considers that there are public health concerns in respect of a batch of a medicinal product (\"the relevant batch\") in relation to which the batch testing exemption would otherwise apply. (12) Where this paragraph applies, the appropriate authority must, subject to paragraph (13), notify the holder of the UK marketing authorisation in respect of the relevant batch that it nevertheless requires that holder\u2014 (a)to submit a sample from the relevant batch to the appropriate authority, together with appropriate documentation; and (b)not to sell or supply, or to offer to sell or supply, a medicinal product that forms part of that batch in the United Kingdom until the appropriate authority has examined\u2014 (i)the sample from that batch, (ii)the appropriate documentation, or (iii)both that sample and that documentation, and confirmed that it is satisfied that the relevant batch is in conformity with the approved specifications in the UK marketing authorisation. (13) The appropriate authority may only exercise its powers under paragraph (12) if the agreement made between the country in which the certificate was issued, and the United Kingdom (whether the agreement is solely with that country, a group of countries or an organisation of which that country is a part) provides for the relevant batch to be re-examined by the appropriate authority in the circumstances described in paragraph (11). (14) The appropriate authority may, in any particular case, apply this regulation to a medicinal product imported into the United Kingdom pursuant to a parallel import licence and accordingly any reference in this regulation to\u2014 (a)a UK marketing authorisation should be read as a reference to a parallel import licence for a medicinal product, (b)the holder of a UK marketing authorisation should be read as a reference to the holder of a parallel import licence, and (c)the approved specifications in a UK marketing authorisation should be read as a reference to the approved specifications in the UK reference product specified for the purposes of the parallel import licence in accordance with paragraph 4 of Schedule 8A.

(4) If, having considered the complaint, OFCOM considers that the advertisement contains prohibited material it may\u2014 (a)in the case of an advertisement that has been included in a licensed service, give to the person who is the holder of the licence in respect of that service a direction to exclude the advertisement from the licensed service; and (b)in the case of an advertisement that has been included in S4C Digital or a service provided by the Welsh Authority under section 205 of the 2003 Act, give to the Welsh Authority a direction to exclude the advertisement from S4C Digital or the service provided under section 205 of the 2003 Act.

(2) The material provided pursuant to regulation 50G(3) must include\u2014 (a)material which demonstrates that the disease or condition for which the medicinal product would be authorised affects not more than five in 10,000 persons in Great Britain at the time at which the application for an orphan marketing authorisation is submitted, where this is available; (b)details of the condition intended to be treated and a justification of the life-threatening or chronically debilitating nature of the condition, supported by scientific or medical references; and (c)copies of, or references to, relevant scientific literature, as well as copies of information from relevant databases in Great Britain, where available. (3) If there are no databases as referred to in paragraph (2)(c), information from relevant databases in other countries may be supplied, provided appropriate extrapolations are made. 2.\u2014(1) The following provisions apply for the purposes of establishing, pursuant to regulation 50G(2)(a) and (b)(ii), that a medicinal product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition in Great Britain and that the medicinal product is unlikely, when marketed, to generate sufficient financial return to justify the necessary investment. (2) The material provided pursuant to regulation 50G(3) must include\u2014 (a)details of the condition intended to be treated and a justification of the life-threatening or chronically debilitating nature of the condition, supported by scientific or medical references; (b)details of the costs incurred in connection with the development of the medicinal product; (c)details of any grants, tax incentives or other cost recovery provisions received in Great Britain or any other country in relation to the development of the medicinal product; (d)where the medicinal product is already authorised in Great Britain for any indication, or where the product is under investigation for one or more other indications, an explanation of, and justification for, the method that is used to apportion the development costs among the various indications; (e)a statement of and justification for all development costs that the applicant expects to incur after the submission of the application for a UK marketing authorisation; (f)a statement of and justification for all production and marketing costs that the applicant has incurred in the past and expects to incur in the first ten years that the medicinal product is authorised; (g)an estimate of and justification for the expected revenues from sales of the medicinal product in Great Britain and elsewhere during the first ten years that the medicinal product is authorised; and (h)information on the prevalence and incidence in Great Britain of the condition for which the medicinal product would be authorised at the time at which the application for an orphan marketing authorisation application is submitted. (3) The information concerning costs and revenue referred to in sub-paragraph (2) must be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and must be certified by a person who is a member of a body of accountants which is established in the United Kingdom and which is approved by the licensing authority for the purposes of this paragraph. 3.\u2014(1) The following provisions apply for the purposes of establishing, pursuant to regulation 50G(2)(c), that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorised in Great Britain, or if such method exists, that the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. (2) The material provided pursuant to regulation 50G(3) must include\u2014 (a)details of any existing methods of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that have been authorised in Great Britain, making reference to scientific or medical literature or other relevant information, including information relating to authorised medicinal products, medical devices or other methods of diagnosis, prevention or treatment which are used in Great Britain; and (b)a justification as to why either\u2014 (i)the methods referred to in paragraph (a) are not considered satisfactory; or (ii)the medicinal product for which an orphan marketing authorisation is sought will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. (3) In this paragraph, \"significant benefit\" means a clinically relevant advantage or a major contribution to patient care. 4.\u2014(1) The following provisions apply for the purposes of establishing, pursuant to regulation 58D(6)(c), that a second medicinal product is similar to a medicinal product to which an orphan marketing authorisation relates or is safer or more effective than, or clinically superior to, that product. (2) The following definitions apply for the purposes of this paragraph\u2014 \"clinically superior\", in relation to a medicinal product, means that it is shown to provide a significant therapeutic or diagnostic advantage over and above that provided by an authorised orphan medicinal product in one or more of the following ways\u2014 greater efficacy; greater safety in a substantial portion of the target population, as evidenced where appropriate through comparative clinical trials; or in exceptional cases, where neither greater safety nor greater efficacy has been shown, a demonstration that the medicinal product otherwise makes a major contribution to diagnosis or to patient care; \"similar active substance\" means an identical active substance, or an active substance with the same principal molecular structural features, but not necessarily all of the same molecular structural features, and which acts via the same mechanism, however, in the case of advanced therapy medicinal products, for which the principal molecular structural features cannot be fully defined, the similarity between two active substances is to be assessed on the basis of the biological and functional characteristics; \"similar medicinal product\" means a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorised orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. (3) For the purposes of the definition of \"clinically superior\" in relation to a medicinal product which shows that superiority by means of greater efficacy, this is to be assessed by the effect on a clinically meaningful endpoint in adequate and well controlled clinical trials, representing the same kind of evidence needed to support a comparative efficacy claim for two different medicinal products. (4) The clinical trials referred to in paragraph (3) should be direct comparative clinical trials, unless comparisons based on other endpoints, including surrogate endpoints, can be justified. (5) Paragraphs 5 to 8 make further provision about the definition of \"similar active substance\" in relation to certain types of product. 5.\u2014(1) This paragraph applies for the purposes of the definition of \"similar active substance\" in relation to chemical medicinal products.U.K. (2) The principal molecular structural features are the relevant structural components of an active substance, which may be the whole or part of the molecule. (3) Whether the principal molecular structural features are the same between two or more molecules will be identified by comparison of their structures. (4) Isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, esters, ethers, salts and derivatives of the original active substance, or an active substance that differs from the original active substance only with respect to minor changes in the molecular structure, such as a structural analogue, are to be considered similar. (5) Synthetic polynucleotide substances, single or double stranded, consisting of two or more distinct nucleotides where\u2014 (a)the difference in the nucleotide sequence of the purine and pyrimidine bases or their derivatives is not major, are to be considered similar, therefore for antisense or interfering nucleotide substances, addition, substitution or deletion of a nucleotide not significantly affecting the kinetics of hybridisation to the target are usually to be considered similar; and (b)the difference in structure related to modifications of the ribose or deoxyribose backbone sugars or to the replacement of the backbone sugars by synthetic analogues usually result in substances being considered similar, and for antisense or interfering nucleotide substances, changes in the ribose or deoxyribose backbone sugars not significantly affecting the kinetics of hybridisation to the target are usually to be considered similar. 6.\u2014(1) This paragraph applies for the purposes of the definition of \"similar active substance\" in relation to biological medicinal products other than advanced therapy medicinal products.U.K. (2) The principal molecular structural features are the structural components of an active substance that are relevant for the functional characteristics of that substance. (3) The principal molecular structural features may be composed of a therapeutic moiety or a therapeutic moiety in combination with an additional structural element significantly contributing to the functional characteristics of the active substance. (4) An additional structural element as described in paragraph (3) may be conjugated, fused or linked by other means to the therapeutic moiety or may be an extension of the therapeutic moiety protein backbone by additional amino acids. (5) Substances with structural elements for which similar methods of modification or conjugation technology are used usually result in similar substances. (6) Biological active substances which differ from the original biological substance only with respect to minor changes in the molecular structure are to be considered similar. (7) In relation to proteinaceous substances\u2014 (a)if the difference in structure between them is due to post-translational events, such as different glycosylation patterns, substances are usually to be considered similar; however, exceptionally some post-translational modifications may result in a non-similar substance if there is significant effect on the functional characteristics of the substance; (b)if the difference in the amino acid sequence is not major, substances are usually to be considered similar; therefore two pharmacologically related protein substances of the same group, for example, having differences related to N-terminal methionine, naturally extracted as opposed to recombinant nucleic acid-derived proteins or other minor variants, are usually to be considered similar; however, the addition of a structural element may result in substances not being considered similar if this significantly affects the functional characteristics of the substance; (c)monoclonal antibodies binding to the same target epitope are usually to be considered similar; however, two monocloncal antibody conjugates or fusion proteins may be considered not to be similar if either the Complementary Determining Region sequences of the antibody or the additional structural element of the conjugated monoclonal antibody is different. (8) In relation to polysaccharide substances\u2014 (a)if the substances have identical saccharide repeating units, even if the number of units varies, the substances are usually to be considered similar; and (b)a conjugated polysaccharide vaccine compared to a non-conjugated polysaccharide vaccine containing the same antigen is considered not to be similar. 7.\u2014(1) This paragraph applies for the purposes of the definition of \"similar active substance\" in relation to advanced therapy medicinal products.U.K. (2) In relation to cell-based advanced therapy medicinal products, these are not to be considered similar if\u2014 (a)there are differences in starting materials or the final composition of the product which have a significant impact on the biological characteristics or biological activity relevant for the intended therapeutic effect or safety attributes of the product, and the different source of the starting materials, such as in the case of autologous advanced therapy medicinal products, is not sufficient to support a claim that two products are not similar; or (b)there are differences in the manufacturing technology having a significant impact on the biological characteristics or the biological activity relevant for the intended therapeutic effect or safety attributes of the product. (3) In relation to gene therapy medicinal products\u2014 (a)two gene therapy medicinal products are not to be considered similar when there are differences in the therapeutic sequence, viral vector, transfer system, regulatory sequences or manufacturing technology which significantly affect the biological characteristics or biological activity relevant for the intended therapeutic effect or safety attributes of the product; and (b)differences in the therapeutic sequence with a significant impact on the intended therapeutic effect are not sufficient to support a claim that two gene therapy medicinal products are not similar. (4) The considerations in paragraphs (2) and (3) also apply in relation to genetically modified cells. 8.\u2014(1) This paragraph applies for the purposes of the definition of \"similar active substance\" in relation to radiopharmaceuticals.U.K. (2) The same radiopharmaceutical active substance, or one differing from the original in radionuclide, ligand, site of labelling or molecule-radionuclide coupling mechanism linking the molecule and radionuclide which acts via the same mechanism, are to be considered similar substances.] Regulations 50(6)(g) and 64(5)(b) 1.\u2014(1) In this registrable homoeopathic medicinal product; and (b)is indicated for the relief or treatment of minor symptoms or minor conditions in human beings.

(5) The applicant may submit other data in relation to an aspect of the safety of the product if having made reasonable attempts to obtain scientific data in relation to that aspect\u2014 (a)the applicant is satisfied that no such scientific data is available; or (b)the applicant thinks that such scientific data as is available may be inadequate to demonstrate an acceptable level of safety in relation to that aspect. (6) The applicant must include with the data\u2014 (a)a table of contents; and (b)an evaluation of the scientific data, including an explanation of how it demonstrates an acceptable level of safety.

(2) Where the variation is a minor variation of Type IA\u2014 (a)the variation may be implemented in relation to the converted EU marketing authorisation at any time on or after the time at which it may be implemented in relation to the EU marketing authorisation to which the converted EU marketing authorisation relates; (b)the holder of the converted EU marketing authorisation must (subject to paragraph 13), include in the baseline data\u2014 (i)a summary of the variation, and (ii)if the notification has been rejected by the EMA, an indication of that fact; and (c)the variation to the converted EU marketing authorisation is deemed to be accepted unless the licensing authority notifies the holder in writing before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the data submission date that the variation is rejected, in which case the holder must cease to apply the rejected variation immediately after receipt of the notification. (3) Where the variation is a minor variation of Type IB\u2014 (a)the variation may be implemented in relation to the converted EU marketing authorisation at any time on or after the time at which it may be implemented in relation to the EU marketing authorisation to which the converted EU marketing authorisation relates; (b)if the variation has not been rejected by the EMA, the holder of the converted EU marketing authorisation must (subject to paragraph 13) include a copy of the notification in the baseline data; and (c)the variation to the converted EU marketing authorisation is deemed to be accepted unless the licensing authority notifies the holder in writing before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the data submission date that the variation is rejected, in which case the holder must cease to apply the rejected variation immediately after receipt of the notification.

(3) Where the variation is a minor variation of Type IB, a major variation of Type II or an extension which has not been rejected by the EMA\u2014 (a)the holder of the converted EU marketing authorisation must submit to the licensing authority\u2014 (i)the notification of, or application for, the variation, and (ii)(subject to paragraph 13) the baseline data; and (b)the licensing authority must consider the application in accordance with Schedule 10A. 13.\u2014(1) If a holder of a converted EU marketing authorisation wishes the licensing authority to consider a notification of, or an application for, a variation to the authorisation before the data submission date, the holder must\u2014 (a)submit the notification or application to the licensing authority; and (b)unless sub-paragraph (2) applies, provide to the licensing authority at the same time such information concerning the product to which the converted EU marketing authorisation relates as may be specified in writing by the licensing authority for this purpose and published on or before IP completion day.

(2) Where this paragraph applies, and where the holder wishes the proposed change to apply in relation to the converted EU marketing authorisation\u2014 (a)the holder of the converted EU marketing authorisation may put the change into effect at the same time as it may be put into effect in relation to the EU marketing authorisation; (b)the holder must (subject to paragraph 21) include with the baseline data\u2014 (i)a copy of the notification, and (ii)an indication of whether the EMA has opposed the proposed change; and (c)the proposed change to the labelling or the package leaflet of the converted EU marketing authorisation is deemed to be accepted unless the licensing authority notifies the holder in writing within the period of 30 days beginning with the data submission date that the proposed change is opposed, in which case the holder must cease to apply the opposed change immediately after receipt of the notification. 21.\u2014(1) If a holder of a converted EU marketing authorisation wishes to notify the licensing authority of a proposed change to an aspect of the labelling or the package leaflet of the EU marketing authorisation to which the converted EU marketing authorisation relates in advance of the data submission date, the holder must\u2014 (a)submit the notification of the proposed change to the licensing authority; and (b)unless sub-paragraph (2) applies, at the same time provide the licensing authority with such information concerning the product to which the converted EU marketing authorisation relates as may be specified in writing by the licensing authority for this purpose and published on or before IP completion day.

(2) But sub-paragraph (1) continues to apply to a person after the end of the specified period only if the person has, before the end of that period, notified the licensing authority in writing of\u2014 (a)a named individual who resides and operates in the United Kingdom who the licensing authority may contact in respect of any matter relating to the converted EU marketing authorisation during the transitional period; and (b)that individual's address, telephone number and email address.

(3) In making a decision under regulation 68 in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), the licensing authority must have regard to\u2014 (a)any relevant information obtained by it before IP completion day in relation to the specified matter as a consequence of its involvement in the procedure under Article 20 of Regulation [(EC) No 726/2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/eur/2004/726); (b)any relevant decision made, or agreement reached, before IP completion day, where the United Kingdom participated as a member State in the making of that decision or agreement, under any procedure provided for in the Council Decision of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedure for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission; and (c)any advice it receives from the appropriate committee pursuant to the procedures in Schedule 11. (4) Sub-paragraph (5) applies if the licensing authority is making a decision under regulation 68 in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) in a case where the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has given a final opinion in relation to the specified matter. (5) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the licensing authority may treat the opinion as if it were the opinion of the appropriate committee for the purposes of paragraph 5 of Schedule 11. (6) Sub-paragraph (7) applies where\u2014 (a)the European Commission has requested the opinion of the EMA in accordance with Article 20(2) of Regulation [(EC) No 726/2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/eur/2004/726) in relation to a specified matter; (b)a final decision has been adopted by the European Commission in accordance with Article 20(3) of that Regulation immediately before IP completion day; but (c)the necessary steps to give effect to the decision referred to in paragraph (b) have not been taken before IP completion day.

(8) In this paragraph, \"specified matter\" means a matter in relation to which the opinion of the EMA has been requested by the European Commission under Article 20(2) of Regulation [(EC) No 726/2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/eur/2004/726) before IP completion day that might result in the suspension, revocation or variation of an EU marketing authorisation which is a converted EU marketing authorisation. 25. If a holder of a converted EU marketing authorisation fails to comply with an obligation imposed on the holder by or under this Part, the licensing authority may suspend the authorisation until the holder complies with the obligation. 26ZA.\u2014(1) This paragraph applies in relation to a UK marketing authorisation granted by the licensing authority under Chapter 4 of Title III to the 2001 Directive that was in force immediately before IP completion day.

(2) But sub-paragraph (1) continues to apply to a person where the UK marketing authorisation or parallel import licence authorises sale or supply of the medicinal product in Great Britain only if the person has notified the licensing authority in writing of\u2014 (a)a named individual who resides and operates in the United Kingdom who the licensing authority may contact in respect of any matter relating to the UK marketing authorisation or parallel import licence, or application for a UK marketing authorisation or parallel import licence (as the case may be), during the transitional period; and (b)that individual's address, telephone number and email address. (3) A person must notify the licensing authority under sub-paragraph (2)\u2014 (a)where sub-paragraph (1)(a)(i) to (iii) applies, within the period of 4 weeks beginning with IP completion day; or (b)where sub-paragraph (1)(a)(iv) applies, at the time of making the application. (4) This paragraph does not apply to a UK marketing authorisation that is a converted EU marketing authorisation within the meaning of paragraph 6. (5) In this paragraph \"the transitional period\" means the period of 24 months beginning with IP completion day. 27.\u2014(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), a person to whom paragraph 26 applies does not commit an offence under regulation 268 (offence relating to packaging and package leaflets in Great Britain: holder of authorisation etc) during the transitional period to the extent that\u2014 (a)the packaging and package leaflet do not comply with the requirements of Part 13 (packaging and leaflets) by reason only of the fact that the outer or immediate packaging, or the package leaflet (as the case may be), do not include the correct information as to\u2014 (i)the name and address of the holder of the UK marketing authorisation, or, where applicable, the name of that holder's representative, (ii)the number of the UK marketing authorisation, or (iii)the name and address of the manufacturer of the product; and (b)the outer and immediate packaging, or the package leaflet, do not include the correct information specified in paragraph (a)(i) to (iii) solely because\u2014 (i)the UK marketing authorisation holder has established itself in the United Kingdom before the end of the period of 24 months beginning with IP completion day in order to comply with regulation 49(3), and (ii)the information specified in paragraph (a)(i) to (iii) is no longer correct as a consequence of that establishment in the United Kingdom. (2) Sub-paragraph (1) only applies if\u2014 (a)the packaging and package leaflet met the requirements of Part 13 as to the matters specified in paragraph (1)(a)(i) to (iii) immediately before IP completion day; and (b)the UK marketing authorisation holder, having established itself in the United Kingdom, does not otherwise need to make any changes to the outer or immediate packaging, or the package leaflet, as the case may be, during the transitional period. (3) In this paragraph \"the transitional period\" means the period of 36 months beginning with IP completion day. 27A.\u2014(1) This paragraph applies in relation to a parallel import licence granted by the licensing authority that was in force immediately before IP completion day. (2) A parallel import licence to which this paragraph applies\u2014 (a)has effect on and after IP completion day as a parallel import licence in force in the whole United Kingdom granted under regulation 49(1) of these Regulations; and (b)is treated as including a statement that it is in force in the whole United Kingdom for the purposes of regulation 49(1C). 28.\u2014(1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies where\u2014 (a)a person holds a parallel distribution notice, issued by the EMA, for a medicinal product in respect of which there is an EU marketing authorisation; (b)that distribution notice, and that EU marketing authorisation, are in force immediately before IP completion day; and (c)that parallel distribution notice specifies the United Kingdom as a member state of destination in respect of that medicinal product. (2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3), a person who falls within sub-paragraph (1) is deemed, on and after IP completion day, to have a parallel import licence granted under Part 5, in force in Great Britain only, in respect of the medicinal product specified in the parallel distribution notice. (3) A person who falls within sub-paragraph (1) continues to hold a parallel import licence pursuant to sub-paragraph (2) only if that person notifies the licensing authority\u2014 (a)before the end of the period of 21 days beginning with IP completion day, of each medicinal product, and each country from which it is intended to import that product on or after IP completion day; and (b)of any other information that the licensing authority requests, within such time period as the licensing authority may specify. (4) The licensing authority must as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of the information specified in sub-paragraph (3), issue a parallel import licence to the holder of the parallel distribution notice. 29.\u2014(1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies where\u2014 (a)a marketing authorisation was in force before IP completion day, (b)that authorisation is in force as a UK marketing authorisation on IP completion day (whether or not it is suspended); and (c)that authorisation is for a medicinal product of a type that is specified in regulation 60A(2)(a) to (e) (condition as to the submitting of samples and other information to the appropriate authority). (2) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the UK marketing authorisation is deemed to include the batch testing condition on and after IP completion day. (3) Sub-paragraph (4) applies where a holder of a UK marketing authorisation has, before IP completion day, submitted to a competent authority of an EEA State samples for testing from a batch of a medicinal product (\"the relevant batch\") that\u2014 (a)is the subject of that authorisation; and (b)is of a type specified in regulation 60A(2)(a) to (e). (4) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the holder of the UK marketing authorisation is deemed to have satisfied the batch testing condition in respect of the relevant batch if, before IP completion day\u2014 (a)the competent authority of that EEA State examines the sample from the relevant batch; and (b)that authority declared it to be in conformity with the approved specifications (within the meaning of Article 114 of the 2001 Directive) before IP completion day. (5) The appropriate authority\u2014 (a)must include each EEA State on the list it publishes under regulation 60A(5) on IP completion day; and (b)must not, before the end of the transitional period, exercise its powers under regulation 60A(8) to remove an EEA State from the list it publishes under regulation 60A(5). (6) For the purposes of regulation 60A(9), the appropriate authority must, on IP completion day\u2014 (a)include Switzerland and Israel in the list it publishes under that paragraph; and (b)include in respect of those countries any conditions or restrictions in the arrangement with those countries that affect the applicability of the batch testing exemption. (7) In this paragraph\u2014 (a)\"the transitional period\" means the period of 24 months beginning with IP completion day; and (b)\"the batch testing condition\" and \"the batch testing exemption\" have the same meaning as in regulation 60A. (8) This paragraph, with the exception of sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), applies equally to a medicinal product imported into the United Kingdom pursuant to a parallel import licence and accordingly any reference in this paragraph (other than in this sub-paragraph) to\u2014 (a)a marketing authorisation or a UK marketing authorisation is to be read as a reference to a parallel import licence for a medicinal product, and (b)the holder of a UK marketing authorisation is to be read as a reference to the holder of a parallel import licence. 29A.\u2014(1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies where\u2014 (a)an EU marketing authorisation was in force before IP completion day, (b)that authorisation is in force on IP completion day (whether or not it is suspended); and (c)that authorisation is for a medicinal product of a type that is specified in regulation 60B(2) (requirement to submit samples and other information to the appropriate authority). (2) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the EU marketing authorisation is deemed to be subject to the batch testing requirement in regulation 60B on and after IP completion day. (3) Sub-paragraph (4) applies where a holder of an EU marketing authorisation has, before IP completion day, submitted to a competent authority of an EEA State samples for testing from a batch of a medicinal product (\"the relevant batch\") that\u2014 (a)is the subject of that authorisation; and (b)is of a type specified in regulation 60B(2). (4) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the holder of the EU marketing authorisation is deemed to have satisfied the batch testing requirement in regulation 60B in respect of the relevant batch if, before IP completion day\u2014 (a)the competent authority of that EEA State examines the sample from the relevant batch; and (b)that authority declared it to be in conformity with the approved specifications (within the meaning of Article 114 of the 2001 Directive) before IP completion day. (5) Sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) of paragraph 29 apply in relation to the appropriate authority's management of the list published under regulation 60A(5) for the purposes of this paragraph and regulation 60B. 30.\u2014(1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies in relation to a UK marketing authorisation which, immediately before IP completion day, is part of a global marketing authorisation with one or more EU marketing authorisations or marketing authorisations granted by the competent authority of an EEA state. (2) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the provisions of regulation 48(5) (definitions for Part 5), in so far as they describe a global marketing authorisation by reference to UK marketing authorisations only, do not affect the periods of data and marketing exclusivity to which the holder of a UK marketing authorisation to which this paragraph applies is entitled immediately before IP completion day. 31.\u2014(1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies where, before IP completion day\u2014 (a)an application has been made to the EMA for an EU marketing authorisation; but (b)no final decision has been made by the European Commission in relation to the grant of an EU marketing authorisation under Article 10 of Regulation [(EC) No 726/2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/eur/2004/726). (2) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the applicant may apply to the licensing authority for the grant of a UK marketing authorisation by submitting to the licensing authority\u2014 (a)a copy of the application for the EU marketing authorisation; and (b)if requested by the licensing authority, such material or information that the licensing authority reasonably considers necessary for dealing with the application. (3) Sub-paragraph (4) applies where, before IP completion day and in relation to an application to which sub-paragraph (2) applies, a final opinion favourable to the granting of an EU marketing authorisation has been given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and the United Kingdom concurred with that opinion. (4) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the licensing authority must grant a UK marketing authorisation in response to an application as described in sub-paragraph (2) as soon as reasonably practicable after it is received. (5) Sub-paragraph (6) applies where before IP completion day, in relation to an application to which sub-paragraph (2) applies\u2014 (a)no final opinion favourable to the granting of an EU marketing authorisation has been given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use; or (b)such an opinion has been given but the United Kingdom recorded a divergent opinion. (6) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the licensing authority must consider an application made under sub-paragraph (2) in accordance with Part 5 of these Regulations (marketing authorisations). 32.\u2014(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), a person\u2014 (a)who applied to the EMA for an EU marketing authorisation before IP completion day; (b)to whom the licensing authority grants a UK marketing authorisation on or after IP completion day in response to that application in accordance with paragraph 31; and (c)who was, immediately before IP completion day, established in an EEA State, and remains established there on and after IP completion day, is to be treated, for the transitional period, as satisfying the requirements of regulation 49(3), notwithstanding the amendments made to those provisions by the EU Exit Regulations. (2) Sub-paragraph (1) applies to a person only if, when submitting a copy of the application for the EU marketing authorisation to the licensing authority in accordance with paragraph 31, the person notifies the licensing authority in writing of\u2014 (a)a named individual who resides and operates in the United Kingdom whom the licensing authority may contact in respect of any matter relating to the UK marketing authorisation during the transitional period; and (b)that individual's address, telephone number and email address. (3) In this paragraph, \"the transitional period\" means the period which beginning with the date on which the licensing authority grants a UK marketing authorisation as described in paragraph 31(4) and ending 24 months after IP completion day. 33.\u2014(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), a person to whom paragraph 32(1) applies does not commit an offence under regulation 268 (offence relating to packaging and package leaflets in Great Britain: holder of authorisation etc) during the transitional period to the extent that\u2014 (a)the packaging and package leaflet do not comply with the requirements of Part 13 (packaging and leaflets) by reason only of the fact that the outer or immediate packaging, or the package leaflet, do not include the correct information as to\u2014 (i)the name and address of the holder of the marketing authorisation, or, where applicable, the name of the holder's representative, (ii)the number of the marketing authorisation, or (iii)the name and address of the manufacturer of the product; and (b)the outer and immediate packaging, or the package leaflet, do not include the correct information specified in paragraph (a)(i) to (iii) solely because\u2014 (i)the number of the marketing authorisation is the number of the EU marketing authorisation to which the application for the EU marketing authorisation related, or (ii)the UK marketing authorisation holder has established itself in the United Kingdom before the end of the period of 24 months beginning with IP completion day in order to comply with regulation 49(3), and the information specified in paragraph (a)(i) or (iii) is no longer correct as a consequence of that establishment in the United Kingdom. (2) Sub-paragraph (1) only applies if\u2014 (a)the packaging and package leaflet met the requirements of Part 13 as to the matters specified in sub-paragraph (1)(a)(i) to (iii) immediately before IP completion day; and (b)the UK marketing authorisation holder, being aware of the number of the UK marketing authorisation and having established in the United Kingdom, does not otherwise need to make any changes to the outer or immediate packaging, or the package leaflet, as the case may be, during the transitional period. (3) In this paragraph, \"the transitional period\" means the period beginning with the date on which the licensing authority grants a UK marketing authorisation as described in paragraph 31(4) and ending 36 months after IP completion day. 34.\u2014(1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies where an application for a UK marketing authorisation has been made before IP completion day and\u2014 (a)regulation 58(6) and (7) of the 2012 Regulations (applications to be determined under Chapter 4 of Title III of the 2001 Directive) applied to that application before IP completion day; but (b)a decision as specified in Article 28(5) of the 2001 Directive has not been adopted by the licensing authority before IP completion day. (2) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the licensing authority must\u2014 (a)where the procedure specified in Article 28(4) of the 2001 Directive has concluded before IP completion day in relation to that application, grant a UK marketing authorisation in respect of that application as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event before the end of the period of 30 days, beginning with IP completion day; or (b)where the procedure specified in Article 28(4) of the 2001 Directive has not concluded before IP completion day, determine that application in accordance with Part 5 of these Regulations (marketing authorisations) as soon as reasonably practicable, unless the applicant notifies the licensing authority in writing that they no longer want the application to proceed. (3) In making a determination under sub-paragraph (2)(b), the licensing authority must have regard to\u2014 (a)any relevant information obtained by it before IP completion day in relation to the application as a consequence of its involvement in any procedure provided for in Chapter 4 of Title III of the 2001 Directive; (b)any relevant decision made, or agreement reached, before IP completion day, where the United Kingdom participated as a reference member state or concerned member state in the making of that decision or agreement, under any procedure provided for in Chapter 4 of Title III of the 2001 Directive; and (c)any advice it receives from the appropriate committee pursuant to the procedures in Schedule 11 (advice and representations).

(2) A holder of the UK marketing authorisation to which this paragraph applies may, subject to complying with the obligations in sub-paragraph (3), continue to refer to the Plasma Master File as certified by the EMA, notwithstanding the modifications to paragraph 1.1(c) of Part III of Annex I to the 2001 Directive in Schedule 8B, subject which that paragraph is to be read on and after IP completion day.

Parts 1 (general) and 2 (administration) consolidate, with only minor and drafting amendments, the administration provisions in Part 1 of the Medicines Act 1968 (\"the 1968 Act\"), including the definition of the licensing authority as the body responsible for regulating products. Part 1 also provides for interpretation, and for special provisions concerning the applicability of the Regulations to a number of activities by pharmacists and others. The latter provisions consolidate, with only minor and drafting amendments, provisions in Part 2 of the 1968 Act, except for the repeal of section 10(7) of the Act, which concerns wholesale dealing by pharmacists. Part 3 (manufacturing and wholesale dealing) of the Regulations governs the manufacture and importation of, and wholesale dealing in, products. It consolidates, with only minor and drafting amendments, the provisions of Part 2 of the 1968 Act, and statutory instruments made under powers in that Part, on these topics. In doing so the Regulations continue to implement the obligations of the United Kingdom under Titles IV and VII of Directive [2001/83/EC](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/directive/2001/0083) of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community Code relating to medicinal products for human use (\"the 2001 Directive\") (OJ No L 311, 28.11.2001, p.67, as amended most recently by Directive 2010/84/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council amending, as regards pharmacovigilance, Directive [2001/83/EC](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/directive/2001/0083) on the Community Code relating to medicinal products for human use (OJ No L 348, 31.12.2010, p.74 ) (\"the 2010 Directive\")). Part 4 (requirement for authorisation) of the Regulations establishes that products must not be sold, supplied, or offered for sale or supply in the United Kingdom unless authorised, either by the United Kingdom licensing authority under the Regulations, or by the European Commission under Regulation [(EC) No 726/2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/regulation/2004/0726) of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Community Procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency (\"Regulation [(EC) No 726/2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/regulation/2004/0726)\") (OJ No L 136, 30.4.2004, p.1, as amended most recently by Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010, OJ No L 348, 31.12.2010, p.1). Parts 5 to 8 (marketing authorisations, certification of homoeopathic medicinal products, traditional herbal registrations and Article 126a authorisations) provide for the procedures for authorisation by the United Kingdom licensing authority of medicinal products in various categories. Part 5 (marketing authorisations) also provides for offences in the case of breach of the corresponding requirements in the procedures under Regulation [(EC) No 726/2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/regulation/2004/0726), and for the breach of certain obligations under Regulation [(EC) No 1901/2006](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/regulation/2006/1901) of the European Parliament and of the Council on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation [(EEC) No 1768/92](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/regulation/1992/1768), Directive [2001/20/EC](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/directive/2001/0020), Directive [2001/83/EC](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/directive/2001/0083) and Regulation [(EC) No 726/2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/regulation/2004/0726) (OJ No L 378, 27.12.2006, p.1, as amended by Regulation [(EC) No 1902/2006](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/regulation/2006/1902) (OJ No L 378, 27.12.2006, p.20). In respect of United Kingdom authorisation, Parts 4 to 8 of the Regulations consolidate, with only minor and drafting amendments, the following principal statutory instruments: the Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations Etc.) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/3144, as amended, most recently S.I. 2010/1882) (\"the marketing authorisations regulations\"), the Medicines (Homoeopathic Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/105, as amended, most recently by S.I. 2006/2407) (\"the homoeopathic regulations\"), except in respect of fees provisions that are not being revoked, and the Medicines (Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/2750, as amended, most recently by S.I. 2010/1621) (\"the traditional herbal regulations\"). In doing so, the Regulations continue to implement Titles III and VI of the 2001 Directive. At the same time the Regulations repeal the parallel national scheme for the licensing of the sale and supply of products, found in Part 2 of the 1968 Act, but now almost entirely superseded by EU provision in this field. Part 9 (borderline products) of the Regulations consolidates, with only minor and drafting amendments, provision in the marketing authorisations regulations for the licensing authority to determine whether products that are supplied without authorisation are medicinal products and thus subject to the Regulations. Part 10 (exceptions) consolidates, with only minor and drafting amendments, provisions in the marketing authorisations regulations, the homoeopathic regulations and the traditional herbal regulations concerning exemptions from the requirement for authorisation. Part 11 (pharmacovigilance) consolidates provisions in the marketing authorisations regulations and the traditional herbal regulations concerning the monitoring of the safety of medicines in clinical use. This Part also implements the amendments to Title IX of the 2001 Directive made by the 2010 Directive. Part 11 also provides for offences in the case of breach of the corresponding requirements under Regulation [(EC) No 726/2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/regulation/2004/0726). Part 12 (dealings with medicinal products) governs the circumstances in which products may be sold, supplied and administered, and consolidates, with only minor and drafting amendments, the greater part of Part 3 of the 1968 Act, certain provisions of the latter which are outside the scope of the 2001 Directive being left unrepealed. Parts 1, 3, 5, 10 and 12 contain provisions consolidating the effect of the Medicines for Human Use (Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1882). In so doing, the Regulations continue to make provision necessary for the operation of Regulation [(EC) No 1394/2007](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/regulation/2007/1394) of the European Parliament and of the Council on advanced therapy medicinal products and amending Directive [2001/83/EC](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/directive/2001/0083) and Regulation [(EC) No 726/2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/regulation/2004/0726) (OJ No L324, 10.12.2007, p.21). Part 13 (packaging and leaflets) Chapter 1 consolidates, with only minor and drafting amendments, provisions in the marketing authorisations regulations, the homoeopathic regulations and the traditional herbal registrations in respect of the information to be supplied with products, continuing to implement Title V of the 2001 Directive. Chapter 2 consolidates certain United Kingdom provisions on child safety in the presentation of products. Part 5 of the 1968 Act, which made parallel provision, is repealed, and the instruments made under it revoked, except in respect of certain powers outside the scope of the 2001 Directive. Part 14 (advertising) consolidates, with only minor and drafting amendments, the Medicines (Advertising) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/1932, as amended, most recently by S.I. 2006/2407) and the Medicines (Monitoring of Advertising) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/1933, as amended, most recently by S.I. 2006/2407). In doing so, it continues to implement Titles VIII and VIIIa of the 2001 Directive. Part 6 of the 1968 Act, which made parallel provision, is repealed, and the instruments made under it revoked. Part 15 (British Pharmacopoeia) consolidates, with only minor and drafting amendments, Part 7 of the 1968 Act. Parts 16 (enforcement) and Part 17 (miscellaneous and general) consolidate, with only minor and drafting amendments, Part 8 (miscellaneous and supplementary provisions) of the 1968 Act as it concerns the topics in the Regulations. That Part remains in force, in amended form, in relation primarily to Part 4 (pharmacies) of the 1968 Act, which remains in force, and to certain other matters outside the scope of the 2001 Directive. Impact assessments for these Regulations have been prepared and are available from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (\"MHRA\"), 151 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1W 9SZ, and published with the explanatory memorandum alongside the Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk. A transposition note for the 2010 Directive has been prepared, and is also available "}
