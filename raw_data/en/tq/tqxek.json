Check out our top picks and learn how to pick the BEST vitamins for kids!", "sitename": "Momdot.com", "date": "2022-10-27", "cleaned_text": "Choosing an organic vitamin for toddlers means getting the benefits of vitamin and mineral supplements while ensuring that the plant-based sources are non-GMO and have not been treated with pesticides. Choosing organic kids' [vitamins](https://www.momdot.com/best-kids-probiotic/) for your child is tough, so we've broken down what you need to know and consider before choosing the right one. We'll preface this all first by saying, please consult your child's pediatrician first before starting your child any supplement or vitamin regime. Your child's doctor knows best. Contents Should My Child Take a Vitamin? If your child is eating a well-balanced diet, there's a good chance they do not need to take a [vitamin](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/guide/vitamins-for-kids-do-healthy-kids-need-vitamins#1). However, there are a few cases in which children would benefit from adding a vitamin or children's multivitamin supplement to their diet. Talk to your child's doctor if any of the following apply to your child: - Has a growth delay developmentally or physically - Has a chronic disease - Has food allergies - Has a limited or restrictive diet If your child is a picky eater, that too may be worth considering adding a [multivitamin](https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/features/family-vitamins#2) to fill in the nutritional gaps. Note that if your child is taking medications, certain vitamins, minerals, and supplements can interact with certain medications, so check with the doctor first. Which Vitamins Does My Child Need? As we stated before (and may do so a few times), your child's doctor knows best, so please, check with them first. There are a [few vitamins and minerals](https://keepkidshealthy.com/2018/08/22/which-vitamins-should-my-kids-take/) that are super important for children that some may or may not get already from their diet. Let's take a look at which vitamins and minerals are the most important for kids: Vitamin D is important for building strong bones as well as protecting against disease when they are older. [Good sources of Vitamin D are fish, eggs, and fortified milk](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/guide/calcium-vitamin-d-foods). Calcium is a mineral that works with Vitamin D to build strong bones. Calcium can be gotten from milk, cheese, yogurt, and calcium-fortified juices. Vitamin B and we are talking all Vitamin B's (B12, B6, B3, etc.) are important for energy, circulation, and metabolism as well as the nervous. Vitamin B comes from meat, fish, milk, eggs, nuts, beans, and cheese. Iron is a mineral that is crucial to keeping red blood cells healthy. It also helps kids build muscle. Your doctor can check to see if your child is deficient in iron. There is a risk of iron deficiency in older kids, especially in girls who have begun to menstruate. Iron is found in red meats as well as pork and turkey, beans, spinach, and prunes. Vitamin E is important for a healthy immune system. Vitamin E is found in nuts and seeds like almonds and sunflowers seed as well as some oils such as sunflower oil and safflower oil. Vitamins That Children Should Not Take Vitamin A. Many foods including milk are fortified with vitamin A, and the chances of kids having a vitamin A deficiency are low. Too much vitamin A, on the other hand, can be toxic. Magnesium. Again, the chance of magnesium deficiency is low and magnesium is easily absorbed into the system from the foods kids eat. Vitamin K. Vitamin K is found in many foods. A [deficiency in vitamin K is only a problem for newborns](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=90&ContentID=P02372) who are breastfeeding that did not get the vitamin K shot at birth. Zinc. Zinc deficiency is rare and is found in most foods. Remember, too much of any vitamin isn't good, especially with the above, as they are in most children's diets. However, if you suspect a deficiency in any of the above vitamins, talk to your child's doctor. Pick the Best Multivitamin for Kids Most doctors agree that if a child is eating a well-balanced diet there is no need for any supplements. But if your child avoids a certain food group such as dairy or meat or has another health concern as we mentioned before, a multivitamin might help. But before you grab one off the shelf, like those tasty gummy ones, here are some things you need to know when looking for a multivitamin for your child. - Look for the USP symbol on the label. This ensures the supplement has been tested for quality. - Check for additives, dyes, or any unwanted ingredients. Some supplements add fillers, artificial dyes, or even herbs that you may not know unless you check the ingredients. - Check the sugar content. Of course, it makes taking the multivitamin easier if it has a little sugar in it, but try to choose a multivitamin that has 3 grams or less of sugar per serving. - Check if it contains any allergens. Parents of children with allergies probably already know and frequently check food, but be sure to check supplements for potential allergies as well. Some common allergens that can be in multivitamins include dairy, soy, corn as well as others. The Risk of Eating Too Many Vitamins The one downside to vitamins for kids is that many are tasty. So tasty, in fact, that children are tempted to eat more than the serving suggestion. There is no doubt that gummy multivitamins make it easier for kids to take but can also pose a risk if children get access to them. The best way to prevent an accidental overdose of a multivitamin is to store them out of reach of children. If the vitamins contain iron, lock them up, if possible. It's also a good idea to discuss with your child why taking too many vitamins can be a bad thing. But what if it happens anyway? Here are some signs your child may have eaten too many vitamins: - GI problems - nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting can all be signs that they ate too many vitamins. - Colorful urine or stool. Too much vitamin B can mean neon yellow urine. Vitamins that contain dyes and fillers can turn up in their stool. - Dizziness and trouble walking - Skin irritation - Hair loss If you think your child has ingested too much iron, call the poison control center immediately. You will most likely need to take your child to the emergency room. 9 Best Organic Vitamins for Kids While most of the vitamins on this list are multivitamins, we aimed the included something for every kid, including those who are low in just one vitamin such as vitamin D and iron (though, yes we know iron is technically a mineral). And yes, we'll say it once more - check with your child's doctor first before starting them on any vitamin or supplement. 1.

Frequently Asked Questions Q: At what age can kids start taking a multivitamin? A: Some of the vitamins on our list are safe for kids as young as 2 years old, but check with your doctor first to make sure your child needs and is ready to incorporate a multivitamin into their diet. Q: What exactly is the USP symbol on the label? A: USP stands for United States Pharmacopeia. But what does a [USP-verified supplement](http://www.usp.org/verification-services/verified-mark) actually mean? It has undergone laboratory testing to see if it meets standards of quality. During testing they check for the following: - The ingredients that are on the label, as well as the amounts and potency, are all accurate. - The supplement will break down and be absorbed in the amount of time the company specifies. - It does not contain harmful contaminants. - The supplement has been manufactured according to FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices. Q: Why do gummy multivitamins not contain iron? A: Gummy multivitamins are a great way for kids to take their vitamins, but if your child needs iron, they'll need to take a multivitamin via another means or the iron separately. Why? Simply put, [iron](https://www.consumerlab.com/answers/why-is-iron-not-in-many-multivitamins-how-can-i-find-one-that-does-contain-iron/iron-in-multivitamins/) tastes bad. Most manufacturers choose to leave it out for that reason as well as the potential of an iron overdose. (If kids eat too many, too much iron could be a very bad thing!) Q: What's the difference between a vitamin and a mineral? A: Most multivitamins don't just contain vitamins. They contain minerals as well. But what's the difference? Vitamins are organic substances that come straight from plants and [animals](https://www.momdot.com/create-circus-animal-train-snack/), whereas minerals are inorganic substances that are in water and soil that get ingested by animals or absorbed by plants. Both vitamins and minerals, however, are micronutrients which simply means that they are only needed in small amounts. Q: My child took too many multivitamin gummies! What should I do? A: If your child took too many [multivitamins](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/vitamins-minerals.html) that contain NO iron, they will probably experience some GI problems such as nausea or diarrhea. Make sure your child stays hydrated. However, if their GI problems get worse or they get sluggish or start acting unusual, seek medical care immediately. If your child took too many vitamins that contained iron, call the National Capital Poison Center immediately at 1-800-222-1222. They will direct you on how to treat your child and notify the nearest emergency center so your child is treated immediately upon arrival. In some cases, they will send an ambulance. To prevent this, be sure to keep all vitamins out of reach of children, and if possible, lock up multivitamins that contain iron. Bottom Line If you are looking for a great do-it-all vitamin to help fill in the nutritional gaps of your child's diet, then the Smarty Pants Organic Kids Complete will certainly complete their daily requirements of the 14 essential vitamins and minerals they need as well as a probiotic and omega 3s. They taste great too, so kids will enjoy taking their vitamins, which means one less battle for you. "}
