It's for fun. Can't you just have fun for an hour and not try to diagnose your mystery boil? We think you've earned it. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy a moment of distraction from that weird growth. You're worth it. [theme music plays] Justin: Hello everybody, and welcome to Sawbones ! A marital tour of misguided medicine. I am your cohost, Justin McElroy. Sydnee: And I'm Sydnee McElroy. Justi n: [singing] Sing a Christmas Carol, sing Christmas Carol! Sydnee: Oh, you're already there! Justin: [singing] Like the children do. Sydnee: You are very \u2014 now, you are very \u2014 Justin: [singing] And enjoy the beauty, and enjoy the beauty. Sydn ee: [simultaneously] Oh, you're gonna \u2014 okay. How much \u2014 Justin: [singing] A merry Christmas will bring to you! Sydnee: Okay. Are we good? Are we good now? Justin: [singing] And since I left \u2014 Sydnee: Oh\u2014 oh, no, no. Okay. You \u2014 you weren't in the spirit earlier today. Justin: That's true. Sydnee: You were very resistant to the season. Justin: That's the thing about Candlenights. It sneaks up on you. Sydnee: Oh! Justin: The season began as s oon as I poured this delicious... delicious, creamery Captain Morgan's finest coconut rum. Sydnee: That's exciting! We never do that on Sawbones . Justin: No, but this is a festive time of year, here on November 21st as the crow flies, as we're recording this. Sydnee: [laughs quietly] And I try not to drink anything while I'm recording. Like, just any beverage, for mouth noise reasons, not \u2014 you know, just even water. And so, like, it's really just that this eggnog with whiskey is sitting next to me. Justin: Yes, and \u2014 Sydnee: It's just calling to me. Justin: Of the mouth noises produced by beverage combos, I can't imagine you could do much worse than eggnog. Sydnee: I'll enjoy that warm eggnog. [wheezes] When we're done with our show! Justin: No! You're g onna record it \u2014 you're gonna drink it as you're recording, 'cause we're celebrating! The Candlenights has fully begun here at Sawbones HQ. Sydnee: We got our tree up. We \u2014 Justin: We got our tree up. Sydnee: We got the inflatables in the front yard. Justin: We watched Albert Finney's brilliant Scrooge , and Sydnee, I am so\u2014 in such a vibe, [through gritted teeth] I cannot wait! no. Justin: ... fun... Sydnee: Oh no. Justin: ... energy you are bringing to this episode of our Sawbones podcast. You know, some of 'em can be a little bit dour, but I just know that with this great holiday groove we got goin' on here at the McElroy household, you have got something... j -j-j-j-jolly. Sydnee: Well... we've been sticking to, like, Sawbones original material lately, with a lot of history. Old medical stuff. But occasionally we like to dip into new fads, new health trends that will be Sawber \u2014 Saw\u2014 Saw\u2014 hmm. Sawbones fodder for th e future. Justin: She hasn't even dipped into the eggnog, folks. Sydnee: haven't had the eggnog yet. Justin: [laughs] Sydnee: Just can't say that word. Uh, and we \u2014 recently it has come to my attention that... okay. As you know, if you li sten to our show, resistance to vaccines \u2014 Justin: Oh, this isn't feeling very festive, Sydnee. Sydnee: \u2014is not new. Uh, ever since the first, the smallpox vaccine, was introduced, and people started \u2014 businesses and schools and stuff started saying \"Hey, we want everybody to get this before you show up so you don't, you know, spread deadly smallpox to everyon e.\" Uh, we've had anti -vaxxers. And the arguments have been pretty similar over the years. Religious freedom, or just freedom freedom. Just all freedom. Freedom \u2014 Justin: Freedom freedom, regular freedom. Sydnee: And, uh, fear of what's in it. Natur al stuff, \"I like to stick to natural things, I don't like... whatever. Medicine.\" [laughs quietly] Um, the same stuff, right? A lot of people are just scared of shots. I think that is still \u2014 I still hold that a lot of people are just scared of needles, and if vaccines were pills it would not be such an issue. Justin: Probably. I think that's a fair assumption. Sydnee: But some \u2014 some vaccines are pills, to be fair. It's just most aren't. Justin: It's true! Sydnee: But, uh, an idea \u2014 Justin: And if it was a TikTok... then, I think people would have no problems, 'cause \u2014 Sydnee: Or a Tic Tac. Justin: Or a Tic Tac! If it was a Tic Tac. People were wild about those things. That would be my problem, is if the vaccine was a Tic Tac, I'd pop one, be like, \"Oh my gosh, good,\" and then later \u2014 Sydnee: I gotta have more. Justin: I wouldn't even be thinking about it. You know what I mean? I'd just pop it open and jam four in. Sydnee: And you'd be ultr a-vaccinated. Justin: There's not an amount of Tic Tacs where you're like, \"Huh, this is good. This is a good amount of Tic Tacs in my mouth.\" Sydnee: You feel that way about Tic Tacs? Justin: Yeah! It's not like I love 'em or anything, but it's j ust like, what am I doing? You put one Tic Tac in your mouth and you're like, \"What am I doing? Did a tooth come loose?\" Sydnee: That is similar to the problem with TikToks. Justin: Yeah, that \u2014 bet you can't watch just one. Sydnee: Yeah. So, okay. But this idea isn't new. But the idea that, uh \u2014 okay. Let's say you have to get the vaccine. You don't want to. Justin: Ugh. Sydnee: But you \u2014 Justin: The Man. Sydnee: \u2014you have to , to keep your job, or... because you want to travel, or you want to go to a restaurant in New York, or whatever. And so you're gonna get it, but you need a way to undo it. Justin: Okay. Sydnee: Right? That seems newer. It's not \u2014 it's not \u2014 it's not just a COVID thing, but it is definitely newer than general resistance to vaccines. There definitely is this new idea that, like, \"Okay. Well, so you \u2014 you went and did it. You got the vaccine. Now, how can you detox yourself... after you get it?\" Justin: Which is a mis \u2014 it's not a toxin to begin with, right? Sydnee: No, it's not. It's not. I mean, the thing is, um... [sighs] I... okay. Justin: [laughs] Sydnee: It\u2014 in the fiction of this, the idea is that after you've gotten the vaccine, under duress, I suppose, you will need to cleanse yourself of all the stuff that was in it that worried you about it and made you resistant to it to begin with. And what are those things well, it just depends on who you're asking. Some will tell yo u it's the toxins. And the word \"toxin\" is used in sort of, like, pseudomedicine wellness circles to mean... any \u2014 whatever \u2014 whatever you need it to mean at the moment. Radiation. Especially, you know \u2014 there's a lot of talk about the COVID vaccine can... I don't\u2014 give you great cell phone reception, or... make your internet work faster. Justin: [quietly] Make your... kind of break your ding dong. Sydnee: [inhales] That, yeah. That's \u2014 it doesn't, but yes. And, uh, nanotechnology. You know, the usual stuff. The usual stuff that you worry about. [laughs quietly] Nanotechnology. Um, now, uh... if you have been recently vaccinated and this is getting you worried , I'm gonna kind of go back to a brief history associated with this before I get into, like, the current COVID discussion around it. Um, but I do want \u2014 and give you, like, your detox formulas. But, uh, I do want to say, since that might stress you out to know that you're not gonna hear the [laughs] detox formulas till the end of the show, um, it is impossible to... well, first of all, you can 't\u2014 it's not a toxin. You couldn't detox. But, like, if what you're trying to say is you want to remove the vaccine after you' ve put it in you, it's impossible. You can't. There's nothing that would. Nothing. Justin: Nothing. Sydnee: Nothing, period, end of sen \u2014 like, I don't need to do a study. It just doesn't. You can't. It's in there. That's it. Done. And moreover, you would never want to, because it's going to prime your immune system to protect you from getting or dying of a deadly virus, so. Justin: But... what if I want to? Sydnee: [sighs] Um, you want to what? Justin: What have you got \u2014 what have you got f \u2014 Sydnee: Die of coronavirus? Justin: No! I wanna get it out, Syd! What've you got for me? Sydnee: Oh, okay. So, I'm gonna get there. I'm gonna get to what the current COVID thing is. But before that, I do wa nt to step back just a couple decades, just a few \u2014 a few decades. Justin: [time travel whooshing noises] Sydnee: Because when it comes to vaccine conspiracies and misinformation campaigns, the roots of these are often tied to autism. Justin: Mmm. Sydnee: Sadly, that's where a lot of this sort of, um , these bad ideas, these fake ideas, and these harmful ideas, that's where they come from, are these incredibly dangerous, sometimes just ignorant, and then sometimes malicious quote, unquote, \"treatmen ts\" or \"cures\" for autism. And again, they're based on theories about why autism happens that are also completely wrong, and untrue, and have been disproven repeatedly, repeatedly, and the ideas stick anyway. But back in the 90's, the complete quack and dangerous source of deadly misinformation, Andrew Wakefield , promoted the completely false idea \u2014 and I'm say \u2014 I am reinstating how false these are, because these ideas keep perpetuat ing, and there's some that would argue, like, just don't ever talk about 'em again, and wait till they go away, but... [sighs] I don't know. I would say the last few years have taught us that that doesn't necessarily work. [laughs quietly] Um, ideas don't go away just because you refuse to acknowledge them 'cause they are so ri diculous. Uh, but anyway \u2014 so, he comple \u2014 he promoted the completely false idea that thimerosal, which was a mercury -containing compound that was used in some multi -dose vials of vaccines \u2014 so, some \u2014some \u2014 you've probably seen, like, a lot of, uh, vaccine \u2014 before COVID, you wouldn't have seen a lot of these, but the little vials that the vaccine comes it. People are doing all kinds of fun things with them now, making chandeliers out of them, and Christmas lights, and all kinds of things. Yeah. Um \u2014 Justin: We have a very different algorithm. Sydnee: [laughs] Justin: TikToks, I think. Sydnee: So in these little vials can contain a single dose of a medicine or vaccine, or they could contain multiple doses. And sometimes thimerosal was used in some of these multi -dose vaccine vials to stabilize it. That's it. Um, it contained an incredibly tiny, tiny amount of mercury that was found to be completely clinically insignificant, and could not possibly have any effect in the human body; less mercury than, say, eating fish that contains mercury. If you're worried about mercury, get your vaccines and don't eat fish... but I'm not even saying that, 'cause you can still consume a safe amount of fish. Justin: To be fair, I don't eat fish... either. Sydnee: Well, one, you do. Justin: To be fair \u2014 Sydnee: And two \u2014[laughs] Justin: To be fair, let' s put it all on the table. I'm trying to talk for long enough for you to drink a little bit of eggnog, okay? I'm just saying \u2014 I'm just saying \u2014 Sydnee: Well, you can say. What was the solution that Andrew Wakefield came up with if you have this false beli ef that vaccines with thimerosal could've caused autism? Um, what did he advise parents to do? Justin: To not \u2014 he advised them, he said, \"Don't get this vaccine. Just let your \u2014\" Sydnee: Yes. said, \"Don't nated. Don't this is, again, completely false. Justin: Don't tru \u2014 by the way \u2014 Sydnee: This is all a lie. Justin: \u2014don't cut that out and make it a text tone, when I just said that! Okay? Sydnee: [laughs] This is what \u2014 this is what Wakefield said, who has been, again, completely discredited, lost his license. His study was falsified. It was completely fake. All of it was fake. It was retracted. This was all fake. But the damage was done, because this idea , completely wrong and based on lies , has stuck, and continues to damage people to this day. Justin: I wanna make an argument. If you want another sip of e ggnog, this'll take me, like, 30 seconds. Sydnee: Okay. Justin: Uh, here is a eggno \u2014 the eggnog that I [wheezes] want to offer. No, here is the theory that I wanna offer. Is Andrew Wakefield \u2014 I'm phrasing this as a question, so it's legally defensible. Is Andrew Wakefield the worst dude... among the, like, top... echelon of worst dudes ever? Sydnee: I mean, he's definitely \u2014 I would not say \"the worst.\" I think that\u2014 Justin: No, though, that's a \u2014 I'm not ge \u2014 I'm not wadin' into that. Sydnee: Yeah, I think that there are some contenders there for that, like, if we look back not too far in human history. Um, but he's \u2014 I mean, he's up there, because vaccine resistance leads to the spread of deadly childhood diseases. So, um, anything that encourage s kids' parents not to get their kids vaccinated puts those kids' lives at risk. You can do the rest of that figuring out for yourself, but yeah, I'd put him up there. Um, so a lot of people began to wonder, even though, again, his ideas would all be di scredited and he would lose his license, and he should be forgotten forever, but he still, I think, circulates in anti -vax... you know. Justin: I mean, we keep bringing him up, but we bring up a lot of people on this show. It's a real rogue's gallery. [ wheezes] Sydnee: There were a lot of parents who started asking, \"Well, what do I do if my kid's already been vaccinated ?\" Like, \"That's fine, I won't get more vaccines, but [laughs quietly] how do I fix the damage from the thimerosal?\" Now, we had kn own about something called chelation therapy since the 1930's, when a compound that was abbreviated EDTA for simplicity was discovered, uh, to be useful in treating lead poisoning. So basically, there are substances that we can put in your body to pull out things that shouldn't be there, like if you actually have heavy metals in your body in toxic amounts, we can give you something that will bind those heavy metals and flush them out through your kidneys, right? This is a real thing. Like, 'cause people do get heavy metal poisoning. Like, that is a thing that can happen. That is real. Um, so \u2014 and since then we have developed a number of different compounds that can do that, some that are less toxic and stuff, because some of these are quite dangerous, as I' m gonna get into. But, uh, we know that there is a way if you do, indeed, have heavy metals in your body, that we can remove them. Um... so some people began to get the idea... that if \u2014 again, these are all lies. Justin: Okay. [laughs quietly] Sydnee: But this is what base \u2014 this is where this is all coming from. If thimerosal with mercury in these vaccines is what caused autism, then maybe we could get the mercury back out of the people who've been vaccinated, so remove that vaccine component with chelation therapy, and thereby, as they would argue, as they would term, \"cure\" autism. Justin: Okay. Sydnee: Okay? And so , they began to promote chelation therapy... for kids\u2014 usually kids. I mean, it could be adults. But t hese are generally \u2014 I mean, historically have been parents seeking treatment for autistic children is where the targets of this sorts of therapy, and it would remove the mercury. Um, throughout the early 2000's, there were a lot of quacks out there who w ould offer this. Uh, and, like, come, and you could bring your child, and... allow them to be given chelation therapy with the hopes that it would remove whatever mercury was in there, even if they didn't ha \u2014 and the thing is, like, this wasn't based on som e sort of lab test. It's not like they did \u2014 because this has been done, by the way. 'Cause I know what you're wondering is, like, \"Well, did they even look to see are there higher mercury levels in people with autism?\" No. There aren't. They did that stud y. There is no difference in the amount of mercury in an autistic person and a not autistic person. Like, there just isn't. But they went ahead and offered this anyway. And it was not benign, by the way. That's the other thing to know about chelation the rapy. Uh, even when actually necessary because somebody does have toxic levels of heavy metals in their blood, it's risky. There are risks to this therapy. These compounds are not totally benign. It can cause kidney damage, it can cause dehydration, it can dangerously lower your calcium levels, it can cause liver damage, um, severe allergic reactions. So in the case of somebody with heavy metal toxicity, you'd be balancing those risks versus, I mean, the very real damage that actual heavy metal poisoning ca n do, right? So, like, it's a risk -benefit thing. Like, well, yeah there's dangers to chelation, but if we let you hang out with this heavy metal, you know, you could die of that. So , when used inappropriately, it can cause death. So, despite never provin g that it did anything helpful, in several cases where chelation therapy did, indeed, cause harm or death to children who were undergoing chelation therapy for autism, it persists as a fake medicine, quote, unquote, \"treatment\" for autism. To this day! You will find people who will tell you they will chelate you. Well, again, it's \u2014 it could be aimed at somebody who is actually autistic, but it's generally aimed at parents of autistic children. Justin: The idea being that, again, within the kayf abe of this, like, the \"damage\" has already been done, quote, unquote, by the time you're older, and an adult. Sydnee: Yes, yes. And so \u2014 like, there's a time \u2014 again, this would all be tied to this false belief that the vaccine caused the autism. Like, if you don't buy that, then this theory falls apart. But if you buy into that fake idea, then this would be a viable treatment option. Um, but of course it isn't, and chelation therapy shouldn't be used. And this isn't, of course, the only example of vaccin e reversal being used to falsely treat autism, because there \u2014 like, chelation therapy is sort of the big one. \"This is how we'll get rid of the vaccines.\" There are other ways that they've attempted to get rid of your vaccine, if you have autism, after the fact. Um, and I want to tell you about some of those, but first, we gotta head to the billing department. Justin: Let's go! [ad break] Justin: [swallows] Sorry, Syd. You, uh... teased that there was gonna be a lot more of this kind of thing, so I needed a bit more eggnog. Hope you understand. Sydnee: Oh, that's fair, that's fair. Um, I tried to \u2014 I tried to, um, lay out this episode to start wit h the really egregious stuff and get to the stuff that's \u2014 Justin: The stuff that you kind of support. Sydnee: S\u2014 no. Justin: [wheezes] Sydnee: I don't support any of it. It's still fake, but at least less harmful. Not that that's better. It's al l\u2014 and I should preface with \u2014 and we talk about this a lot on Sawbones , but if you haven't heard it before, we'll say it again. A lot of this is also, um, based on the idea that any neurodivergence is bad, and needs to be... cured, so to speak. Um, and these are not my words. These are the words of the... practitioners, whatever they may be, whatever their licensing or certification may be, who promote these sorts of treatments. That we need to get rid of autism. Justin: You know, again, we've said this before, but I think it bears repeating, especially as someone, like, w ho is\u2014 is, you know, neurodivergent themselves. Like, I think that it bears repeating that autism, and many different types of neurodivergence, are not diseases to be cured, but rather just facets of who people are. I know of and know personally a lot of people who are living on the autism spectrum that have wonderful, amazing, fulfilling, incredible lives, not in spite of that autism, but because of it. It is part of who they are. It is part of their \u2014 their journey. It is part of who they are as people, a nd it's not something to be excoriated, and \u2014 is that a word? That's a word, right? Sydnee: Yeah? Justin: I don't know if it's an appropriate word. It's not a disease! Stop trying to cure autism! Sydnee: Well, and that's \u2014 I think that \u2014 it's wild to me \u2014 Justin: They need support! They need support but, like, [loudly] so does everybody! Sydnee: We all do. And, I mean, we all need different kinds of support. We all learn differently. We know that. We know that there are many different ways that we d evelop as children, and many different ways of supporting children as they're developing that are specific to that kid and their needs. We all \u2014 we all have specific needs. I mean, like, that's \u2014 that's true about all of us, autistic or not. And, um, you kn ow, it's always wild to me that autistic people speak out against all of these sorts of things, you know, once they are given the ability to , once they're adults, you know, once they are no longer sort of having to follow someone else's treatment plan for t hem. They speak out against this, and we don't listen to them. That's really frustrating to me, because you would think that once you have, like, a group of adults saying, like, \"No, no, no. We don't \u2014 please stop. Please stop this stuff.\" Justin: Stop. Sydnee: Um, it's still not enough. But anyway... Justin: I don't want \u2014 I don't want my kids to have flipping chicken pox! Everybody cut it out, please! Sydnee: Uh, this isn't the only example, like I said, of vaccine reversal. Um, t here were a group of Canadian homeopaths who were founded in 2010, and they were called \u2014 again just to sort of echo what we're saying, they were called CEASE, which stood for Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression. [pause] Sydnee: So the re\u2014 there you \u2014 I mean \u2014 Justin: [inhales] Yo, that sounds \u2014 that sounds evil! [laughs] Sydnee: It does sound evil. I mean, like, and when you \u2014 Justin: It sounds evil! Stop! Sydnee: It sounds like eugenics. Justin: It does! Sydnee: I mean, if you just want to put it out there. Justin: It does! Sydnee: Like, it sounds like euge \u2014 and now, they're not \u2014 it's not exactly eugenics, because it's homeopathy, [through laughter] so it's completely fake. Justin: It's like fake, pretend eu \u2014 it's half -hearted [through laughter] eugenics for people, yeah. Sydnee: Yeah, it's completely, um \u2014 but basically \u2014 Justin: Ugh, God! Sydnee: \u2014they advise the use of [laughs] homeopathic vaccines to reverse the effects of t he original vaccines, that they believed, again, caused the autism. Or at least they said 70% of autism is caused by vaccines. I don't know about the other 30%, but 70% were definitely vaccines. And so , they basically would administer an incredibly dilut ed form of a vaccine. [pause] Which would do nothing. I mean, the \u2014 in this case, this could not \u2014 I mean, it \u2014 we've talked about homeopathy, also. Things are diluted to such an extent that there may not even be more than a... I don't know. Justin: Molecu les of \u2014 Sydnee: A molecule of the original compound in whatever you're actually given, and so most homeopathic medicines \u2014 not all, most\u2014 couldn't cause harm, because they're basically water. Um, now, that isn't always true. There are some that have been shown to be dangerous. But generally, they just don't do anything. They're dangerous in the sense that you're turning to that instead of a ctual medicine. Justin: Right. Sydnee: So they would, uh , they administer those, and then just counsel you once you get treated, \"Just don't get any more vaccines.\" Um, and again, on the less dangerous but even more absurd side, there was another va ccine detox that was prescribed by fake doctors for autism, uh, consisting of cod liver oil. So... Justin: Oh, good. Sydnee: [laughs quietly] Basically after your babies have had \u2014 after your baby has had a round of vaccines \u2014 these were mainly aimed at little, little kids. Because we do get a lot of vaccines early in childhood, and in case you have that question, why do we get the vaccine so little? If we're \u2014 you know, if people are nervous about this stuff, why don't we wait till kids are older to give them the vaccines so they won't be so nervous? Because we give the vaccines prior to the ages when most kids died of these diseases before vaccines, so that's always a good point to bring up. And I'll hear a lot of really well -meaning, just, like, really wanting to know the truth, parents who will ask me that question. \"Couldn't we give 'em later?\" And the case is \u2014 and the truth is, like, well, if we gave 'em later, we may miss our opportunity, and your kid might get sick, so that's why we give them so e arly. Because before we had vaccines, a lot of kids died before they were two. Justin: Yeah. Sydnee: And, you know, now they don't. So, uh, the cod liver oil detox is basically, very small amounts \u2014 it's, like, a... half a teaspoon, and a quarter teaspoon of cod liver oil, that you either put in the baby bottle, or you could just rub it on their tummy. Justin: Okay, sure, yes. Sydnee: After the vaccines. Um, and of course there were specific cod liver oil brands that were promoted... [laughs quietly] for this purpose. The reason cod liver oil is they were looking for something with Vitamin A, and it has a lot, and it was the best form. I don't know. There are always these sort of, like, very tenuous arguments about, like, \"Well, here's why this over all the other ways you could get this vitamin. This is why I chose cod liver oil.\" Um... so, where do es that leave us now? Because we've talked a lot about, like, there is a precedent for this. In \u2014 in fake medicine circles, there has been this idea that while vaccines, in their minds, are bad, there is something you could do to sort of save yourself if you 've already committed the sin of getting a vaccine. You can reverse the vaccine in these ways. Um, joining the fray recently , the reason this has made headlines , is Dr. Carrie Madej, um, who... [sighs] you know, DOs get enough crap without her having to a dd to [laughs quietly] the stuff that they'll get. I saw every article kept referring to her as the osteopath, and I thought, \"Man. All my osteopathic friends she \u2014 Justin: I feel that way whenever they have gamers on Law & Order , so I completely \u2014 like, I understand. Sydnee: There are plenty of MDs who do ridiculous, dangerous, bad stuff too, but they don't refer to us as \"allopaths,\" and they're not, like \u2014 you know what I mean? Justin: Yeah. Sydnee: I feel like \u2014 anyway. The point is, she came out with her own detox bath that you can use. Like, you can get in a bathtub and put these substances in it after you get your COVID vaccines, um, to, you know, fix all the damage that she would claim the COVID vaccines have done to you. So basically, you would draw a bath, and add some Epsom salts and baking soda, because that will remove all the radiation. Justin: Perfect, yes. Sydnee: Right. You know, that we all know. Justin: You didn't even need to say it. We all knew. Sydnee: Mm-hmm. You need t he bentonite clay in there to remove the toxins. Justin: Okay, good. Sydnee: What Sydnee: Justin, the toxins! Justin: You know deep down in your heart without even having to read about it, the toxins. Sydnee: Yeah. And of course , the thing that made headlines, borax, to remove... the nanotechnology that is inside you. That's what the borax is for, by the way. Justin: Wait, did you \u2014 Sydnee: It's for the nanotech. Justin: No, this is what the borax is for . [pause] I just played my \"My wife\" sound. I don't think I added it in my soundboard. Sydnee: [laughs] Justin: But it \u2014 you know. Sydnee: Not Borat , borax. Uh, now, to be fair \u2014 Justin: Wait, hold on, let me try this. Maybe this'll work. Soundboard: My wife! Justin: Yeah, that might've worked. I don't know. Sydnee: Okay. Well, either way \u2014 Justin: Rachel will add it if not. [snort -laughs] Sydnee: Yes, that is what we need t o use \u2014 Justin: [simultaneously] Thank you, Rachel! Sydnee: \u2014her\u2014 her precious time, is to add a wife.\" [laughs] To Sydnee: Borat , it sounds like borax. Uh, to be fair, all the other stuff is harmless, right? Like, I mean, if you put a little bit of baking soda, Epsom salts, bentonite clay in your bath \u2014 Justin: Sounds like a pretty \u2014 sounds like it 's a\u2014 you know, gimme a Danielle Steel and it sounds like we got a nice, relaxing evening there. A coupl e candles? Sydnee: I mean, we've talked before about \u2014 Justin: Some votives? Sydnee: \u2014[laughs quietly] people eating clay, and that can cause some problems. But generally speaking, you put a little bit of this stuff in your bathtub, it's not going to do harm. The borax is the issue. So... Justin: [snorts] Sydnee: Again, in very smal l amounts \u2014 and not even very small, in... I don't wanna say moderate amounts. Borax is... a fairly benign substance, generally speaking. Okay? Justin: Okay? Sydnee: I don't wanna \u2014 I don't wanna misstate. I always wanna be on the\u2014 you kn ow, I always feel like it's important to be honest. Like, this is not a deadly poison that you can't touch at all. Justin: It sounds scary, I will say. Sydnee: It does sound scary. Justin: Borax is a scary name. It's like... but so is Hydrox, and those aren't dangerous. Sydnee: But larger amounts of borax \u2014 that's true. That's very true. It does sound like a cleaning product, though. Um, larger amounts \u2014 Justin: There's a fascinating hist ory there. If Sawbones ever pivots and it's about cookies... there's a fascinating history. Sydnee: All cookies. All the time. Justin: Do you know why they're called Oreos? Sydnee: why they're called Oreos! Sydnee: So, in small amounts, it's likely not harmful. But in larger amounts, it can definitely cause skin irritation. It's always worse for kids. Like, the amounts that are needed to do damage are lower for kids, so if we're talking about kids getting vaccines and then being exposed to borax, that's even worse. Um, obviously it's bad if you inhale or ingest it, especially in kids, again. There is, like, an amount that you could e at, if you wanted, that wouldn't kill you, but... there is also an amount that would harm you, so don't eat it? You don't need to eat it. It doesn't do anything. Um, that's the big thing. Like, it can cause harm. While it is less likely than other substanc es to cause harm, it could, and it absolutely will not help you [emphatically] in any way whatsoever. Period. Like, it will not do anything to help you, whether you bathe in it, or... whatever. Um, because you can't remove a vaccine in a bath... of anyth ing! Not just the COVID vaccine. You can't \u2014 well, why \u2014 how could you wash off a vaccine?! [pause] Justin: I don't know. Sydnee: I mean, think about that! Justin: It's not my \u2014 it's not my idea. Sydnee: Well, I'm just saying, like, really think about that! Um, I don't know of a bath you could get it that would remove the vaccine, unless it's, like, a bath of acid, and you're just... and then... you're dead. Justin: Cool! Sydnee: [laughs] Justin: Nice\u2014 happy Sydnee: I don't know. [laughs quietly] Well, it's just \u2014 Justin: God, Sydnee! Sydnee: \u2014there's not a bath that you could take that would remove a vaccine, which again, you wouldn't want to do. Justin: [indignantly] Okay, then just say that! Sydnee: Um, it's just such \u2014 Justin: You don't have to introduce body horror! Sydnee: \u2014nonsense. It's just such nonsense. It's beyond \u2014 a lot of the nonsense that I just told you, at least there was some sort of vague, like, collection of ideas. Justin: Pseudoscientific, yeah. Sydnee: Right? To support it. This has zero s \u2014 this is just, \"I don't know, get in a bath of stuff, and it'll make the vaccine go \u2014\" I don't even know you make money off that idea. I guess you just get popular? And then you get to talk to other people who have bad ideas? I don't know. Um... this is utter nonsense , and you don't need to remove vaccines, because they are safe and effective. They save lives. And whether you're getting them by choice or because of a mandate, which, by the way, is still a choice, I think is important to remember. [laughs] Justin: Now Sydnee, in the notes here that you have written to yourself, you have some, uh, rather harsh profanity in this section. Which, is you wrote \u2014 you say, \"Which is still effing choice.\" Was that to remind you to be super angry about it at that point? [laughs] Sydnee: No, it's 'cause I was angry when I was typing out my notes. [laughs quietly] Justin: Okay, fair enough. Sydnee: Um, it was a good thing. It was a good thing that you got the vaccine. It's a good thing. Vaccines are good. Um, there are other charlatans out there who are selling nonsense, not just baths, to detox you from the COVID vaccine, but you can find \u2014 if you start looking... [sighs heavily] I did it for you, so I would recommend you don't. Because it'll just make you angry. You can find a lot of books on the subject of, like... first of all, avoiding the vaccine, but then moreover, like, \"Okay, so you got the vaccine. Here's what to do about it now.\" Um, some are older and refer more to things like autism. Some are newer and are specific ally aimed at the COVID vaccine. There was one I found that was called Reversing the Side Effects of the COVID -19 Vaccine: How to Heal Yourself from Adverse Reactions to the Trump Vaccine and Protect Yourself from Shedding . Justin: Wh\u2014 Sydnee: Um, shedding, not... Justin: Okay, got it. Sydnee: Um, I thought that was wild, because it was \u2014 they called it the Trump vaccine, and I started to wonder, [through laughter] who is this for? Justin: Yeah? Who \u2014 laugh ter] Who's this for? Who's the target demo? Sydnee: [laughs] I don't know! I don't know who this is for. Um, it tells you to drink a lot of juice. Like, basically it just recommends juicing. Like, juice, avoid processed foods and GMOs , get a lot of fresh air and sunlight, and also, it says if you're a pre -Vatican II Catholic [holding back laughter] then you'll probably be better off. Justin: Perfect, yeah. I \u2014 but that's, like \u2014 Sydnee: That's how you reverse a vaccine. Justin: Who isn't that applicable to? [laughs quietly] Sydnee: Uh, there is anoth Detox: Detox Your Body from Vaccinations, Immunizations, and Flu Shots Even Years After Taking Them . Justin: Do you know, by the way, I know you're \u2014 you're a lapsed Catholic. Do you understand, to non -Catholic people, how wild the phrase \"pre-Vatican II\" sounds? Sydnee: [laughs] Justin: You understand that sounds like \u2014 that sounds like Catholicism is your HC, and it's just like, \"[nasally voice] Well, I don't really recognize after, you know, that season of Catholicism is not really canonical.\" Sydnee: I was raised in post \u2014 like, in the Vatican II Catholic world. So, like, the Mass was \u2014 I mean, it just was a way to sort of modernize the church, if you're not familiar. I \u2014 well, I don't know if \u2014 Justin: [simultaneously] We're not \u2014 we are \u2014 I love \u2014 I love you \u2014 Sydnee: I don't know if we need to... Justin: My\u2014 Sydnee: Like, the Mass of my parents was in Latin. The Mass that I attended was in... the language I spoke. Justin: My interest in having this discussion \u2014 Sydnee: Okay. Justin: \u2014on top of the curren t discussion is less than nil. Sydnee: I'm just saying, that's \u2014 Justin: I beg of you. Sydnee: \u2014that was \u2014 that's what that is. Justin: I just wanted to sideswipe Catholicism real quick! Sydnee: Thanks. Justin: And then move on! Sydnee: I'm gonna tell my parents on you. Justin: Luckily I'm \u2014 I hail from the impugnable Southern any probl ems there. Uh, this other book was from 2017, but they do add, like, updated, \"This will work for COVID.\" Justin: Good news. Sydnee: \"Don't worry, all this stuff we said will work for all these other vaccines.\" Justin: Well, you know what? Here \u2014 here's what I'll say. It works exactly as well. [laughs] On COVID as it does for the other stuff. Sydnee: Uh\u2014 Justin: I can endorse that fully. Sydnee: And it's just mainly, like, herbal stuff, essential oils. That usual. There's a \u2014 I found a spray y ou can get, a homeopathic vaccine detox spray. I don't know. I have to \u2014 I didn't look at the ingredients. I have to assume its water. Um, but you can spray that, and it will detox your... your body. [laughs quietly] Justin: Great. Sydnee: From vaccines. That's available for just \u2014 I mean, it's 15 bucks for an ounce. That's a steal, you know? Justin: Can I say, [quietly] that sounds like a good value. Sydnee: It d\u2014[laughs] it sounds like a great value. Um, and then there was, uh, I found this other vaccine detoxification plan, that I just really \u2014 [laughs] I enjoyed reading through all of the, uh... let's see. You have to eat a healthy organic diet and avoid toxins like fragrances and fabric softeners. Um, avoid any candles, except f or beeswax candles. Avoid car exhaust. No medicines. Um, and then there's a whole list of supplements that I'm sure you can buy there , that you make a paste out of and, like, just put over [through laughter] the injection site. Justin: Perfect. Sydnee: [laughs breathlessly] To draw it out, I suppose. I don't know. Um, if all this is making you feel sad and helpless, don't let it, 'cause here is what I thought about. As I was reading all of this, I thought, \"Oh, ugh. This is so sad.\" And then I thought, \"Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.\" All these people who peddle all of this pseudoscience and misinformation are usually, usually after attention and money, right? Justin: Mm-hmm. Sydnee: Like, that's really their endgame. Yes, there are true believers who really think that they've found the secret treatment or cure for something, but most of the time it's about attention and money. If the attention and money is no longer in trying to convince you to avoid the vaccines, if the attention and money is in c onvincing people who have already gotten the vaccine to do whatever their silly advice is to try to detox themselves... then maybe that's an indicator of how many people are getting vaccinated. Maybe we should look at it in a positive way. You can't make t hat much money or get that much attention screaming about how bad vaccines are anymore, because so many more people are gonna get vaccinated than will resist it. And I try to remind myself that that's \u2014 that's the truth, is the people who are anti -vax are a very, very loud minority. Justin: Mm-hmm. Sydnee: And depending on where you live \u2014 and Justin and I can empathize very strongly with this... Justin: [clicks tongue] Sydnee: [laughs quietly] ... that may be a larger minority. But still, more people have been and will get vaccinated than won't, and, uh, you did the right thing, and obviously all of this detox stuff is complete nonsense, and shouldn't \u2014 wouldn't work, and wouldn't need to anyway, because all the vaccine did was tell your immune system how to defend you against a deadly virus that has already taken so many lives. So, you protected yourself, you protected other people. [sighs] I mean, there's a part of me that feel s like if there are people out there who will, you know, rub some paste on their arm and feel better about it, [laughs quietly] at least they got vaccinated in the first place. But I can't think that way, 'cause I'm a scientist. And again, at the end of th e day, just get the vaccine, 'cause it's safe and effective. Justin: Yeah, uh, please. Sydnee: Please. Justin: Please. Sydnee: You're protecting yourself and you're protecting other people, and you're helping us move back to a time where those of us [shakily] with young children could leave the house? Justin: That would be a delight. Sydnee: Or people who are immunocompromised, you know? We would all like to go engage with society again . Justin: Um, if you're looking for something yo u can do, uh, in addition to just, you know, getting the vaccine and telling people that you know to get the vaccine \u2014 Sydnee: And encouraging them not to bathe in borax. Justin: \u2014uh, there's also \u2014 we got some pro -vax merchandise, if you want to call i t that, on mcelroymerch.com. Specifically there's a t -shirt, our vaccines shirt. 100% of the proceeds from that go to the Immunization Action Coalition. Their website is immunize.org. It's a great organization that we have worked with for years at this poi nt. Uh, even before COVID, we were working with the IAC. And, uh \u2014 Sydnee: Well, vaccines have always been great. COVID just reminded us in real time why they are. Justin: Yeah, just how great they are. Uh, that's at mcelroymerch. Speaking of, um, thi s is\u2014 this may not interest you, I don't know, but I'll mention it. Um, on, uh, Thanksgiving, I and my brothers and the two guys from Worst Idea of All Time, Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery, we do a Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 review show called Till Death Do Us Bla rt. We do it every Thanksgiving, American Thanksgiving. Uh, we have for seven years now! This is our seventh episode of the show. That'll be out on, as you might have guessed, Thanksgiving. So, uh, if you go to mcelroymerch.com we got a shirt there, or just listen to it. It's called Till Death Do Us Blart , which is an excellent title, still. Uh, we got a book, The Sawbones Book . You can get it at a bookstore, but more importantly, go get your vaccine, tell everybody to get your vaccines. Sydnee: Flu shots, too. Justin: Flu shots, too! Ooh, that flu shot went down smooth this year. Real nice vintage. Sydnee: Charlie's ge tting her second COVID vaccine in two days. Justin: Yep. By the time you're listening to this, today, the day you're listening to this, assuming you're listening to it \u2014 Sydnee: Ooh, that's true. Justin: \u2014the day it comes out. Sydnee: Charlie will be getting her second COVID \u2014 we got one more kid to go. Justin: Amazing. Uh, thank you so much for listening to our podcast. That's gonna do it for us. Until next time, my name is Justin McElroy. Sydnee: I'm Sydnee McElroy. Justin: And, as always, don't drill a hole in your head! [theme music plays] [chord] Maximumfun.org. Comedy and Culture.
