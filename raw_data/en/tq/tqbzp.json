A portion of the TCM herbal and mineral products are believed to be toxic according to modern standards, and are still widely prescribed in the clinic. However, some TCM products considered to be non-toxic or low-toxic have been reported to possess significant toxicological effects on different organs in both animal and human models. In this review, we define the term \"toxic\" in TCM, and then we summarize the advances in pharmacology and toxicology research of Toxic Traditional Chinese Medicine (TTCM), including Chinese aconite (Fu Zi), Arsenic Trioxide, Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f. (Thunder God Vine), herbal drugs derived from plants in the Aristolochiaceae Juss. family (Ma Dou Ling), and other TCM products. Finally, the compatibility art of TCM and modern pharmaceutical approaches to manage undesired toxicity of TTCM is discussed. Promoting pharmacology and toxicology studies of TTCM and non-toxic TCM is critical for the further development and safety of TCM in clinical practice.
