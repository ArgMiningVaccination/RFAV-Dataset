Acupuncture is an eastern form of medicine that helps people with numerous ailments such as: - Anxiety or distress - Illnesses - Smoking cessation - Weight loss - Pain Management - Headaches - Increasing fertility What is acupuncture? Acupuncture is a health science that early physicians in East Asia have been using for more than 5,000 years to treat pain and dysfunction in the body. There are over 1,000 \"acupoints\" on the body, which directly affect the energy network right below the surface of the skin that affect internal organs and structures. Acupuncture has been met with success all over the world and is considered the most effective healing science. How does it work? Hair-thin needles are inserted into acupuncture points or points of heat in order to bring endorphins and energy, promoting your body to heal itself. Acupuncture is relaxing and soothing to many. Is it painful? Many people think of getting a shot at a doctor's office when they think of acupuncture. However, the experiences are not the same, especially in terms of pain. In fact, acupuncture needles are so thin, they can fit inside of the needles used at the doctor's office. People experience a tingling that is described as less than a mosquito bite.
