This Coordination of Benefit (\"COB\") section applies when an Enrollee has Coverage for Health Services under more than one \"Plan,\" as defined below. The Order of Benefit Rules in Section 11.3 determines whether the benefits of this Contract are determined before or after those of another Plan. If the Order of Benefit Rules determines that this Contract is the \"Primary Plan,\" as defined below, then the benefits of this Contract will not be reduced. If the Order of B enefit Rules determines that this Contract is the \"Secondary Plan,\" as defined below, then the benefits of this Contract may be reduced. Section 11.2 Definitions. The following definitions apply throughout this Article 11 , but do not apply to the rest of the Contract : (A) \"Allowable Expense \" means a necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the 57 62033 -2015 -1 [MDwise Marketplace Individual Child -Only Policy ] claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi -private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of servi ces, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the plan provisions, the amount of th e reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred provider arrangements. (B) \"Claim Determination Period \" means a cale ndar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract , or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. (C) \"Plan \" means this Contract and any of the following arrangements that provide benefits or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (1) Employer insurance or Employer -type coverage, whether insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, Employer practice or indiv idual practice coverage. It also includes coverage other than school accident -type coverage. (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or coverage required or provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (Title XIX, Grants to States for M edical Assistance Programs, of the United States Social Security Act, as amended from time to time). (3) Each arrangement described in (1) or (2) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate plan. (D) \"Plan Year \" means, for the initial Plan Year, the twelve -month period commencing with the date that Employer's coverage under this Contract becomes effective. Thereafter, it means the twelve -month period commencing on the anniv ersary of Employer's Coverage under this Contract . (E) \"Primary \" or \" Primary Plan \" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If this Contract is Primary to another Plan, this Contract 's benefits will be determined before those of the other Plan without conside ring the other Plan's benefits. (F) \"Secondary \" or \" Secondary Plan \" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If this Contract is Secondary to another Plan, this Contract 's benefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a result of benefits provided by the other Plan. Section 11.3 Order of Benefit Rules. General . If there is a basis for benefits under this Contract and another Plan, this Contract is the Secondary Plan unless (1) the other Plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those of this Contract , and (2) the rules of this Contract and the other Plan require this Contract to be the Primary Plan. Specific Rules . The following rules will be applied in the order they appear to determine whether this Contract is Primary or Secondary to another Plan: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent . The Plan that covers the indiv idual as an active employee or inactive employee (i.e., laid -off or retired) rather than as a dependent is the Primary Plan except in the following situation. The Plan that covers the individual as a dependent is Primary to the Plan that covers the indivi dual as an employee if the individual is also a Medicare beneficiary, and, as a result of the rule established by Title XVIII of the Social Security Act and implementing regulations, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the individual as a dependent and Primary to the Plan covering the individual as an employee. 58 62033 -2015 -1 [MDwise Marketplace Individual Child -Only Policy ] (2) Dependent Child or Parents not Separated or Divorced . If two Plans cover the same child as a dependent of his parents, the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a calendar year will be Primary. If both parents have the same birthday, then the Plan that has covered one parent longer will be the Primary Plan. However, if the other Plan has a rule based on gender instead of this birthday rule and, as a result, the Plans do not ag ree on the order of benefits, then the rule in the other Plan will determine the order of benefits. (3) Dependent Child or Separated or Divorced . If two or more Plans cover the same child as a dependent of divorced or separated parents the following rules ap ply unless a qualified medical child support order (\"QMCSO\"), as defined in ERISA, specifies otherwise: a. the Plan of the parent with custody of the Child is Primary; b. the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child is the next Plan to be Pri mary; and c. the Plan of the parent without custody of the child is the last Plan to be Primary. If a QMCSO states that a parent is responsible for the health care expense of a child, that parent's Plan is Primary as long as the administrator of the Plan has actual knowledge of the QMCSO. The plan of the other parent is the Secondary Plan. Until the plan administrator has actual knowledge of the QMCSO, then the rules stated in (a), (b), and (c) above apply for any Claim Determination Period or Plan Year duri ng which benefits are paid or provided. (4) Joint Custody . If a court order states that a child's parents have joint custody of the child but does not specify that one parent is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the order of benefit rules in Paragraph (2), Dependent Child or Parents not Separated or Divorced will apply. (5) Active or Inactive Employee . A Plan that covers an individual as an active employee is Primary to a Plan that covers the individual as an inactive employ ee (i.e., laid -off or retired). This rule will be ignored if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits. (6) Dependent of Active or Inactive Employee . A Plan that covers an individual as a depend ent of an active employee is Primary to a Plan that covers an individual as a dependent of an inactive employee (i.e., laid - off or retired). This rule will be ignored if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on th e order of benefits. (7) Continuation Coverage . If an individual has Continuation Coverage under this Contract and also has coverage under another Plan as an employee or dependent, the other Plan is Primary to this Contract . This rule will be ignored if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits. (8) Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage . If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the Plan that has covered the indivi dual longer will be Primary to the Plan that has covered the individual for a shorter term. Section 11.4 Effect on the Benefits of this Contract . Section 11.4 applies when the Order of Benefit Rules in Section 11.3 determine that this Contract is Secondar y to one or more other Plans. This Contract 's benefits will be reduced when the sum of (1) and (2) below exceeds the Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under this Contract in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under the other Plans, in the absence of COB provisions like this Contract 's COB provisions, whether or not a claim is made. The benefits of this Contract will be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under the other Plans do not exceed the Allowable Expenses. Each benefit will be proportionally reduced and then charged against any applicable benefit limit of this Contract . 59 62033 -2015 -1 [MDwise Marketplace Individual Child -Only Policy ] Section 11.5 Facility of Pa yment . If another Plan provides a benefit that should have been paid or provided under this Contract , We may reimburse the Plan for the benefit. We may then treat the amount as if it were a benefit provided under this Contract and will not be responsible for providing that benefit again. This provision applies to the payment of benefits as well as to providing services. If services are provided, then We will reimburse the other Plan for the reasonable cash value of those serv ices. Section 11.6 Right of Recovery. If this Contract provides a benefit that exceeds the amount of benefit it should have provided under the terms of these COB provisions, We may seek to recover the excess of the amount paid or the reasonable cash value of services provided from the following . (1) The individuals We have paid or for whom We have provided the benefit; (2) Insurance Companies; or (3) Other Organizations. Article 1 2 GENERAL PROVISIONS Section 12.1 Entire Contract.

This Coordination of Benefit (\"COB\") section applies when an Enrollee has Coverage for Health Services under more than one \"Plan,\" as defined below. The Order of Benefit Rules in Section 11.3 determines whether the benefits of this Contract are determined before or after those of another Plan. If the Order of Benefit Rules determines that this Contract is the \"Primary Plan,\" as defined below, then the benefits of this Contract will not be reduced. If the Order of B enefit Rules determines that this Contract is the \"Secondary Plan,\" as defined below, then the benefits of this Contract may be reduced. Section 11.2 Definitions. The following definitions apply throughout this Article 11 , but do not apply to the rest of the Contract : (A) \"Allowable Expense \" means a necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi -private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of servi ces, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the plan provisions, the amount of th e reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred provider arrangements. (B) \"Claim Determination Period \" means a cale ndar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract , or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. (C) \"Plan \" means this Contract and any of the following arrangements that provide benefits or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (1) Employer insurance or Employer -type coverage, whether insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, Employer practice or indiv idual practice coverage. It also includes coverage other than school accident -type coverage. (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or coverage required or provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (Title XIX, Grants to States for M edical Assistance Programs, of the United States Social Security Act, as amended from time to time). (3) Each arrangement described in (1) or (2) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate plan. (D) \"Plan Year \" means, for the initial Plan Year, the twelve -month period commencing with the date that Employer's coverage under this Contract becomes effective. Thereafter, it means the twelve -month period commencing on the anniv ersary of Employer's Coverage under this Contract . (E) \"Primary \" or \" Primary Plan \" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If this Contract is Primary to another Plan, this Contract 's benefits will be determined before those of the other Plan without conside ring the other Plan's benefits. 56 62033 -2015 -1 [MDwise Marketplace Individual Child -Only Policy ] (F) \"Secondary \" or \" Secondary Plan \" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If this Contract is Secondary to another Plan, this Contract 's benefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a result of benefits provided by the other Plan. Section 11.3 Order of Benefit Rules. General . If there is a basis for benefits under this Contract and another Plan, this Contract is the Secondary Plan unless (1) the other Plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those of this Contract , and (2) the rules of this Contract and the other Plan require this Contract to be the Primary Plan. Specific Rules . The following rules will be applied in the order they appear to determine whether this Contract is Primary or Secondary to another Plan: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent . The Plan that covers the indiv idual as an active employee or inactive employee (i.e., laid -off or retired) rather than as a dependent is the Primary Plan except in the following situation. The Plan that covers the individual as a dependent is Primary to the Plan that covers the indivi dual as an employee if the individual is also a Medicare beneficiary, and, as a result of the rule established by Title XVIII of the Social Security Act and implementing regulations, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the individual as a dependent and Primary to the Plan covering the individual as an employee. (2) Dependent Child or Parents not Separated or Divorced . If two Plans cover the same child as a dependent of his parents, the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a calendar year will be Primary. If both parents have the same birthday, then the Plan that has covered one parent longer will be the Primary Plan. However, if the other Plan has a rule based on gender instead of this birthday rule and, as a result, the Plans do not ag ree on the order of benefits, then the rule in the other Plan will determine the order of benefits. (3) Dependent Child or Separated or Divorced . If two or more Plans cover the same child as a dependent of divorced or separated parents the following rules ap ply unless a qualified medical child support order (\"QMCSO\"), as defined in ERISA, specifies otherwise: a. the Plan of the parent with custody of the Child is Primary; b. the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child is the next Plan to be Pri mary; and c. the Plan of the parent without custody of the child is the last Plan to be Primary. If a QMCSO states that a parent is responsible for the health care expense of a child, that parent's Plan is Primary as long as the administrator of the Plan has actual knowledge of the QMCSO. The plan of the other parent is the Secondary Plan. Until the plan administrator has actual knowledge of the QMCSO, then the rules stated in (a), (b), and (c) above apply for any Claim Determination Period or Plan Year duri ng which benefits are paid or provided. (4) Joint Custody . If a court order states that a child's parents have joint custody of the child but does not specify that one parent is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the order of benefit rules in Paragraph (2), Dependent Child or Parents not Separated or Divorced will apply. (5) Active or Inactive Employee . A Plan that covers an individual as an active employee is Primary to a Plan that covers the individual as an inactive employ ee (i.e., laid -off or retired). This rule will be ignored if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits. (6) Dependent of Active or Inactive Employee . A Plan that covers an individual as a depend ent of an active employee is Primary to a Plan that covers an individual as a dependent of an inactive employee (i.e., laid - off or retired). This rule will be ignored if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on th e order of benefits. 57 62033 -2015 -1 [MDwise Marketplace Individual Child -Only Policy ] (7) Continuation Coverage . If an individual has Continuation Coverage under this Contract and also has coverage under another Plan as an employee or dependent, the other Plan is Primary to this Contract . This rule will be ignored if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits. (8) Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage . If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the Plan that has covered the indivi dual longer will be Primary to the Plan that has covered the individual for a shorter term. Section 11.4 Effect on the Benefits of this Contract . Section 11.4 applies when the Order of Benefit Rules in Section 11.3 determine that this Contract is Secondar y to one or more other Plans. This Contract 's benefits will be reduced when the sum of (1) and (2) below exceeds the Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under this Contract in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under the other Plans, in the absence of COB provisions like this Contract 's COB provisions, whether or not a claim is made. The benefits of this Contract will be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under the other Plans do not exceed the Allowable Expenses. Each benefit will be proportionally reduced and then charged against any applicable benefit limit of this Contract . Section 11.5 Facility of Pa yment . If another Plan provides a benefit that should have been paid or provided under this Contract , We may reimburse the Plan for the benefit. We may then treat the amount as if it were a benefit provided under this Contract and will not be responsible for providing that benefit again. This provision applies to the payment of benefits as well as to providing services. If services are provided, then We will reimburse the other Plan for the reasonable cash value of those serv ices. Section 11.6 Right of Recovery. If this Contract provides a benefit that exceeds the amount of benefit it should have provided under the terms of these COB provisions, We may seek to recover the excess of the amount paid or the reasonable cash value of services provided from the following . (1) The individuals We have paid or for whom We have provided the benefit; (2) Insurance Companies; or (3) Other Organizations. Article 1 2 GENERAL PROVISIONS Section 12.1 Entire Contract.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This memorandum documents the development of individual rates for MDwise. These rates will be offered inside of the State of Indiana's health insurance exchange, which is being operated by the federal government. MDwise is a notforprofit corporation that purchased 100% of the stock in IU Health Plan, Inc., a fully licensed HMO, (IUHP) on December 29, 2006. IUHP was merged into MDwise, Inc. as of January 1, 2007. MDwise remains a fully licensed Indiana domestic HMO. MDwise is jointly controlled by Indiana University Health, Inc. and Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County Indiana. The two parent companies are notforprofit, are incorporated in the State of Indiana, and are provider delivery system companies. Beginning January 1, 2011, MDwise was granted a fouryear contract with the State of Indiana (the \"State\"), through the Family and Social Service Administration (\"FSSA\") and Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (\"OMPP\"), to arrange for and administer two riskbased managed care programs (\"Hoosier Healthwise\" and \"Healthy Indiana Plan\") for certain Indiana Medicaid enrollees. MDwise contracts with various delivery networks. The delivery networks accept the medical service risk for enrollees who choose a primary care provider after selecting the MDwise network. There were approximately 280,000 members enrolled in the Hoosier Healthwise and Healthy Indiana Plan products at December 31, 2013. Under an Accountable Care Organization model, MDwise contracts with several integrated delivery systems to provide medical services and claims administration under risk contracts for their current business. MDwise has operated under this model since its inception. MDwise is offering two individual health insurance products in the Bronze and Silver metal tiers and one individual health insurance product in the Gold metal tier. Being a nonprofit health plan focused on low income individuals, MDwise expects most enrollment to be in the Silver plan, for individuals eligible for premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions. MDwise's mission is to provide health care services to the lower income population. One of the primary reasons that MDwise is entering the individual market within the health insurance exchange is to provide its Medicaid members with an MDwise product offering if they lose Medicaid eligibility. MDwise has applied for a new HMO license in the State of Indiana (MDwise Marketplace). Our filing is in the review process. MDwise anticipates it to be active in time for 2015 Open Enrollment season. MDwise has applied and received a new HIOS ID number of 62033.

GENERAL INFORMATION Company Legal Name: MDwise Marketplace, Inc. State: Indiana HIOS Issuer ID: 62033 Market: Individual Market Effective Date: January 1, 2015 Company Contact Information Primary Contact Name: Elizabeth Eichhorn Primary Contact Telephone Number: 3178227232 Primary Contact Email Address: Eeichhorn@mdwise.org 3. PROPOSED RATE INCREASES MDwise began selling individual policies with effective dates beginning January 2014. They did not previously participate in the individual market. The effective rate increase is 8.8% for 2015 for all proposed individual policies. This large increase is driven primarily by Indiana's transition from a 209(b) state to a 1634 state and the associated population expected to enroll in the individual market because of this change. 4. EXPERIENCE PERIOD PREMIUM AND CLAIMS, BENEFIT CATEGORIES AND PROJECTION FACTORS MDwise began selling individual policies with effective dates beginning January 2014. The effective rate increase for 2015 is 8.8% for all proposed individual policies. Because they did not participate in the individual or small group markets prior to 2014 and 2014 experience is not yet credible, the rate development is based entirely on a manual rate. MDwise Individual Product MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT 2015 Rate Filing Page 4 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. 5. MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT The basic manual rate development methodology is unchanged from the 2014 premium rate development. Updated market experience was not available at a sufficient level of detail to justify redeveloping the manual rate. Instead, we reflected emerging demographic and risk adjustment information in our morbidity assumptions and updated other assumptions that were different from 2014 including trend, the impact of reinsurance, benefit changes, leveraging of fixed cost sharing items and the addition of individuals expected to enroll in the Individual market starting in 2014 because of Indiana's transition from a 209(b) state to a 1634 state. The approach to premium rate development is as follows: 1. Paid and/or allowed PMPM medical costs were developed using market information including competitor rate filings, premium rates, and financial filings. If historic experience net of member cost sharing was used, paid to allowed ratios were estimated using the Wakely pricing model. Table C1 in Appendix C shows the various sources used for the small group source development. 2. Allowed PMPMs were adjusted for trend and ACA changes and requirements including EHB, pent up demand, morbidity changes between pre and post ACA enrollment and others described below. 3. The Wakely pricing model was calibrated to the adjusted allowed PMPMs and used to estimate paid to allowed ratios. Within a benefit plan offering, a consumer may choose to use providers in a preferred network of providers and receive reduced cost sharing, represented by Tier 1. If a consumer chooses instead to use nonpreferred providers, the cost sharing is greater, represented by Tier 2. They have been blended with a 90% weighting on Tier 1 and 10% on Tier 2, reflective of MDwise's expectations on actual utilization. The pricing by tier and blended result is shown in Appendix A. 4. Administrative costs and regulatory fees and taxes, along with contribution to surplus were added. Appendix C, Table C2 shows the components of the starting allowed PMPM shown in Appendix A. A comparison to the 2014 development is also provided. Source and Appropriateness of Experience Data Used The allowed PMPM target for post reform experience was developed using prereform small group market information. Even though the goal is to price individual products post reform, the post reform individual market may look more like the prereform small group market than the prereform individual market. Therefore, we reviewed rate filings and financial reports for Indiana small group products. We made adjustments for trend, benefit design, and others to adjust the allowed PMPM to the midpoint of the rating period. MDwise Individual Product MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT 2015 Rate Filing Page 5 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. Population Changes The manual rate incorporates results from the SOA study1 (performed by Optum/Lewin) to estimate changes in morbidity from the Indiana preACA market to that enrolled in Indiana post ACA. Results from other states and analyses, including those performed by Wakely were also reviewed, but the Lewin model framework was used. Wakely has performed detailed studies on behalf of individual states with broad health plan participation and detailed data collection. We have found some of the values provided by the health plans, high risk pool, and the state differ (sometimes significantly) from the values presented in the SOA study, which is reasonable given the different data sources used and differences in judgment likely between actuaries performing this type of modeling. We made adjustments and applied judgment with input from the health plan in developing the final estimates of how the post reform market would compare to the prereform market. The primary changes were to decrease the number of previously uninsured entering the market and to increase their assumed health status since the SOA values are targeted once the ACA has been fully implemented. Wakely also reviewed emerging results from the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Reporting study. This study included participation from Indiana issuers, including MDwise. The issuers reported claims and demographic based risk adjustment information through February 2014. The project will include updated information throughout 2014 which we will be reviewing as it becomes available. Emerging Indiana information caused us to increase our morbidity assumption by 2%. This is primarily driven by a higher age distribution than originally anticipated. This adjustment captures expected morbidity over and above allowable rating variation. An additional adjustment of 1.5% is made to account for the transition of individuals that had been covered under Indiana's Medicaid Spenddown program. In developing an assumption for the impact of this population on the market, Wakely considered information provided by the state regarding the population and emerging enrollment of this population into the exchange. The components of the Morbidity Adjustment are shown in Appendix C, Table C2. Appendix F provides the detail behind the base SOA tables and our adjustments to the SOA tables to develop the final morbidity adjustment factor in Appendix C (1.0039). Pent up demand and the 2014 strategic renewal impact adjustments are described in more detail below. Cost Adjustments We have made two adjustments to account for cost variances. Smoking Load - We adjusted the base period data by a factor of 0.9874 to create an index rate that is reflective of a nonsmoking population. 1 Web link (as of 442013): http://www.soa.org/NewlyInsured/ MDwise Individual Product MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT 2015 Rate Filing Page 6 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. Bad Debt - To account for the likelihood that some policy holders will not pay premiums within the grace period, we have increased rates by a factor of 1.00275. This is calculated assuming a 15% rate of nonpayment of one out of twelve months on about 22% of premium, after considering federal subsidies (.15 x .224 x 1/12 = .00275). Trend Factors (cost / utilization) We assumed PMPM medical costs would increase by 8% annually from 2012 to 2015 due to ongoing increases in utilization, unit costs and technology. This assumption is based on review of rate filings for Indiana and other states, national publicly available trend surveys, and judgment. These trends do not include the effect of demographics or benefits because those adjustments are included elsewhere. Essential Health Benefits (EHB) We adjusted the allowed claims sources in the manual rate development for expected changes in covered benefits due to EHB requirements, specific to individual and small group market starting cost sources. The following is not an allinclusive list but it highlights the benefits expected to have the most significant impacts on allowed costs: Maternity and prescription drug coverage. Mental health and substance abuse parity. Each health plan will need to understand what benefit changes, if any, are needed to bring their current benefits up to parity, especially if the selected EHB is not at parity. Habilitative services, if not defined by the state, need to be defined by the plan. The impact on claims can vary significantly depending on the definition of the benefit. Pediatric vision and dental must be offered under EHB although pediatric dental may be excluded if a standalone dental plan is offered on the Exchange. Each plan must determine the resulting costs of pediatric coverage. Adjustments for changing demographics, changes in benefits, and others were separately addressed and included in the premium rate development. To incorporate these adjustments we increased the small group market source by 2%. Provider Reimbursement Adjustment MDwise provided Wakely with provider contracting targets by plan (based on service area) for inpatient facility, outpatient facility and professional categories of service. Wakely analyzed these targets and compared them to market information regarding current commercial reimbursement rates. We assumed provider volume by provider system would be consistent with current MDwise Medicaid volume by provider system. The total adjustments to allowed cost varied by plan and are reflected in the geographic factors. MDwise Individual Product CREDIBILITY OF EXPERIENCE 2015 Rate Filing Page 7 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. Strategic Renewal Impact Many health plans were working to provide communication and incentive for individual policyholders to renew on 12/1/2013, 1/1/2014, or at their scheduled renewal. This type of strategic approach has been used in the past as states have implemented different state based reforms. This approach likely increased the average morbidity of individuals included in the risk adjustment pool in 2014. The healthy individuals will get a smaller rate increase under preACA policies due to rating for health status while the sicker individuals would get a better rate on ACA policies since they do not rate for health status. For 2015, the impact of strategic renewal would have disappeared but the administration allowed states to continue renewing these policies on preACA products and Indiana has allowed such policies (referred to as a transitional or \"grandmothering\"). We have been informed by the State of Indiana that approximately 20% or less of the market will renew transitional policies. We have included a 1% adjustment (1.01 factor) within our manual rate development for this (part of morbidity adjustment in Appendix C, Table C2). Pent Up Demand In 2014, there were many new enrollees in the individual market that were previously uninsured. Prior to enrolling in coverage, these people would have been paying out of pocket for any medical costs, and it can be assumed that they did not treat minor health problems or receive preventive care due to cost. Once they are covered in the Exchange, there may be an increase in utilization for this population as they will be more likely to afford to have minor issues treated and utilize preventive services. We expect very little remaining pent up demand in 2015. Therefore, we have removed the pent up demand effect and used a factor of 1.0 in Appendix C, Table C2. Inclusion of Capitation Payments While MDwise will pay the Delivery Systems a global cap rate (percentage of premium), the State of Indiana has required MDwise to report the underlying provider payments as the true medical costs to provide coverage in MDwise's financial statements. This is because the Delivery Systems are delegated a portion of the administrative costs associated with their members. Therefore, the capitation paid to the delivery systems is meant to cover direct medical costs, and provider overhead. Based on discussions between MDwise, CCIIO and the state of Indiana, we understand that this treatment will continue in 2014 and beyond. This is important because of the risk corridor protection and minimum loss ratio treatment, which affect the relative level of risk inherent in the premium rate development and overall delivery system payment amounts. 6. CREDIBILITY OF EXPERIENCE MDwise began operating in the individual market in 2014 and that experience is not yet credible. Per request from the State of Indiana Department of Insurance, we have entered projected 2014 information from last year's rate filing in the \"Experience Period\" section of Worksheet 1 of the URRT. However, the MDwise Individual Product PAID TO ALLOWED RATIO 2015 Rate Filing Page 8 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. projection factors (cells J24:M29 on Worksheet 1) have been left blank. The service category PMPMs shown in the \"Credibility Manual\" section of Worksheet 1 were developed based on the approach described above and assigned 100% credibility. 7. PAID TO ALLOWED RATIO The Wakely pricing model uses a nationally representative detailed medical and pharmacy claim and enrollment data (Truven MarketScan) for over 40 million lives to develop paid to allowed pricing estimates for final rate development (as opposed to metal tier categorization). The model uses actuarially sound pricing methods to value the impact of deductibles, copays, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket cost sharing parameters. We calibrated the utilization and unit cost assumptions by category of service in the model to the allowed cost estimates underlying the manual rate and/or experience rate, including adjustments for EHB, trend, provider reimbursement changes by service category, average expected demographics and other adjustments discussed elsewhere in this report. 8. RISK ADJUSTMENT AND REINSURANCE Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM We have developed manual rates for a 1.0 average statewide risk and assumed that MDwise would enroll average risk individuals. Therefore, no risk adjustment PMPM payment is assumed in 2015. Reinsurance The presence of the Federal reinsurance program will reduce costs for issuers in the individual market. This adjustment is intended to capture the portion of costs that will be reimbursed to health plans for reinsurance. The reinsurance payment parameters for 2015 were originally announced as an attachment point of $70,000, a reinsurance cap of $250,000, and a target coinsurance rate of 50%. In final regulations published in late May, CMS stated its intent to lower the 2015 attachment point to $45,000 and suggested the possibility of an adjustment to the 2015 target coinsurance rate. In rates developed for this filing, an attachment point of $45,000 has been assumed. We have assumed no change to the target coinsurance rate of 50%. To estimate the impact of reinsurance, we reviewed several claims probability distributions (CPDs) from different sources, adjusted to our estimated allowed PMPMs. To estimate the impact of moving from allowed to paid continuance, we increased the attachment and maximum values from the federal parameters by the MOOP for various plans, since the vast majority of individuals would have already reached their MOOP when costs reach the reinsurance attachment point. Our estimates are very sensitive to the shape of the CPD, the overall allowed cost PMPM that the CPD is calibrated to, as well as the MOOP and underlying Actuarial Value of the plan. Based on sensitivity testing, we have assumed that the average reinsurance impact will be a 9.6% reduction to net allowed claims costs (11.1% to paid claims). This adjustment was applied uniformly across all benefit plan packages. We have assumed that the allocated MDwise Individual Product NONBENEFIT EXPENSES AND PROFIT & RISK 2015 Rate Filing Page 9 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. federal reinsurance dollars will be sufficient to fund the federal reinsurance program in 2015, which is not guaranteed. 9. NONBENEFIT EXPENSES AND PROFIT & RISK Administrative Expense Load MDwise developed expected administrative costs based on current administrative costs for their Medicaid line of business, adjusted to reflect any differences in functions or level of effort for the commercial product. MDwise assumed a 50% of administrative expenses would increase by 3% from 2014 on a PMPM basis while 50% would increase with premium rates. For the small service areas, the PMPM component was increased to spread fixed costs across a small member cohort. Contribution to Surplus & Risk Margin Three percent (3%) of premiums has been allocated to contribution to surplus. Taxes and Fees Taxes and regulatory fees include the following: 1. PCORI Fee = $0.17 PMPM 2. Issuer Fee = It is not clear if MDwise will be exempt from the issuer fee in 2015. We have assumed they will be subject to the fee in this filing at 2.0%. 3. Health Insurance Exchange Fee = 3.5% of premium for products sold through the Exchange. MDwise expects the vast majority of their business to be sold through the exchange and we have included the full 3.5% load in premium rate development. Please note that in the URRT taxes and fees section, the risk adjustment and reinsurance fees have been excluded. Reinsurance and Risk Adjustment Fees The following fees were netted out of the experience in the URRT. 1. Reinsurance Charge = $3.67 PMPM 2. Risk Adjustment User Fee = $1.00 PMPY ($0.08 PMPM) 10. PROJECTED LOSS RATIO Wakely's estimates indicate projected MLRs for the individual line of business of 82.0% for 2015. Consistent with the MLR and Risk Corridor calculations, regulatory fees and taxes were excluded from premium in the calculation of this value. MDwise Individual Product SINGLE RISK POOL 2015 Rate Filing Page 10 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. 11. SINGLE RISK POOL MDwise has established a single risk pool for all of its individual business. Since MDwise did not participate in the individual market prior to 2014, all of its individual business is nongrandfathered, nontransitional, and ACAcompliant. 12. INDEX RATE Index Rate for Projection Period The starting allowed claim index of $650.20 is developed from the historical claim index rate of the Indiana Small Group Market. Appendix C, Table C2 illustrates this development. The bullet points below briefly describe specific line items in Table C2. For comparative purposes, the adjustment for average percentage of smokers has been retained in the table. Per CCIIO instructions, the adjustment for the smoker load should not be included in the starting allowed claim cost, so to calculate the $650.20 the factor is excluded. Base Period Allowed PMPM - These historical claim index rates are developed from publicly available information. Cost Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for cost differences between the base period and projected period and include an adjustment for the expected bad debt that is introduced by the grace period. Benefit Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for differences between the base period benefits and those offered under the exchange as essential health benefits. Morbidity Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for differences in the morbidity of the population underlying the base period allowed PMPM and the population expected in the exchange market. Included in this adjustment are considerations for morbidity and demographic differences, pentup demand, and the impact of transitional policies. Trend factor - We used an assumed trend of 8.0% over 30 months to trend the base period data to a midpoint of 7/1/2015. Allowed Claim Index Rate by Source - The allowed claim index rate is calculated as the product of the historical claim index rate and all the factors listed above in this section. Market Adjusted Index Rate We included the impact of reinsurance and risk adjustment and the exchange user fee to the index rate for the projection period to develop the market adjusted index rate. The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item g. MDwise Individual Product AV METAL LEVELS 2015 Rate Filing Page 11 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. Plan Adjusted Index Rate To bring the experience used in the manual rating to a \"nontobacco\" basis, a downward adjustment is applied using a factor of 0.9874. Among the items contemplated when setting this assumption were the rates of tobacco use in Indiana as well as the proportion of people who will selfreport as \"Smokers.\" We multiplied the market adjusted rate by provider contracting discounts, the actuarial value and the federal induced demand factors. We then included the admin, commissions, ACA fees, tax, and profit margin. The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item v. Calibration To bring the experience to age 21 rate, we divided the plan adjusted index rate by the weighted average age factor. The age factor was calculated as the weighted average of ACA age factors and the 2015 expected individual enrollment by age. The average age is approximately 50 years. The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item w. Consumer Adjusted Index Rate The consumer adjusted index rates are calculated by multiplying the calibrated plan adjusted index rates by the consumer's specific age factor, area, and tobacco status. As last year's restrictions on the smoker load (limiting smoker loaded rates to the same 3:1 limit as nonsmoker rates) have been removed, the loads have been change and are shown in Appendix D. Using the age factors and smoking load Area Factors in Appendix D, one can take the index rate from Appendix A and develop the rates for each product and age combination. Two examples are provided in Appendix E. 13. AV METAL LEVELS The Federal AVC was used without modification to generate the AV metal tier (column b on Appendix A). The Federal AVCs were as follows: Bronze A 61.8% Silver A (base) 68.1% Silver B (73% CSR) 73.8% MDwise Individual Product AV PRICING VALUES 2015 Rate Filing Page 12 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. Silver B (87% CSR) 86.1% Silver B (94% CSR) 93.0% 14. AV PRICING VALUES The reference plan underlying our pricing was a Silver plan. From this base PMPM, we applied benefit richness utilization adjustments to stratify this PMPM to levels suitable for each of the metal tiers. We used the following values which are equal to the Federal values published in the Federal Register payment notice, normalized to the silver benefit level: Bronze = 1.00 / 1.03 = 0.9709 Silver = 1.03 / 1.03 = 1.0000 Gold = 1.08 / 1.03 = 1.0485 MDwise is not offering Platinum or Catastrophic plans. The adjustment factors above are shown in Appendix A, column o. The same underlying cost distribution and cost level was used. The only adjustment before determining AV pricing values was benefit richness utilization differences using Federal adjustment factors. Therefore, differences in expected morbidity across metal tiers were not included in the pricing development for each metal tier plan. These adjustments do not incorporate a selection bias due to health status. Rather, they represent an adjustment due to any particular individual utilizing services differently when they have a richer or less rich benefit design. The pricing AVs are higher than the Federal AVCs primarily because the estimated allowed PMPMs are higher than those underlying the Federal AV calculator. This is due to a leveraging effect for fixed cost sharing elements like copays, deductibles and MOOPs. This effect is more pronounced in 2015 than it was in 2014 because of the morbidity increases assumed due to the addition of the high risk population (conversion from 209(b) to 1634) and the higher age distribution. 15. MEMBERSHIP PROJECTIONS The membership projections for 2015 were developed by Wakely in consultation with MDwise based on emerging enrollment and expected new enrollment for 2015. Appendix B shows estimates of the Cost Sharing Reduction by Silver base and Silver variant level. We used the Federal formula shown in the Advance Payment Notice, which is equal to the difference in AVC MDwise Individual Product TERMINATED PRODUCTS 2015 Rate Filing Page 13 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. multiplied by the allowed cost PMPM for each base plan, increased by 1.12 for cost sharing utilization for the 87% and 94% variants. 16. TERMINATED PRODUCTS MDwise began selling individual policies with effective dates beginning January 1, 2014. They have no prior products to terminate. 17. PLAN TYPE MDwise is filing HMO products. 18. URRT WARNINGS There were no warnings in the URRT. 19. RELIANCE Wakely Consulting Group, Inc., 9777 Pyramid Ct, Suite 260, Englewood, CO 80112 relied on information provided by MDwise to develop the 2014 individual premium rates. This information includes, but is not limited to the following: Provider contracting levels, including descriptions of the relationship between the Delivery systems and MDwise Administrative cost projections Projected enrollment figures by QHP Product design information Provider network information including discount data CCIIO and the State of Indiana regulatory and compliance interpretations and rulings Commercial rate filings and financial reports of carriers participating in the preACA market. 20. ACTUARIAL CERTIFICATION I, Ross Winkelman, am a Fellow in the Society of Actuaries (FSA) and a member of the American Academy of Actuaries (MAAA). I meet the Qualification Standards of Actuarial Opinion as adopted by the American Academy of Actuaries. MDwise Individual Product ACTUARIAL CERTIFICATION 2015 Rate Filing Page 14 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. The submission is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidance of the Federal government and the state of Indiana as of July 25, 2014. The submission is in compliance with the appropriate Actuarial Standards of Practice (ASOP's) including: ASOP No. 5, Incurred Health and Disability Claims ASOP No. 8, Regulatory Filings for Health Plan Entities ASOP No. 12, Risk Classification ASOP No. 23, Data Quality ASOP No. 25, Credibility Procedures Applicable to Accident and Health, Group Term Life, and Property/Casualty Coverages ASOP No. 41, Actuarial Communication In my opinion, the premiums are reasonable in relation to the benefits provided and the population anticipated to be covered. Further, the premiums are not excessive nor deficient although actual experience may vary from the estimates inherent in the premium rate development. The index rate and only the allowable modifiers as described in 45 CFR 156.80(d)(1) and 45 CFR 156.80(d)(2) were used to generate plan level rates. The percent of total premium that represents essential health benefits included in Worksheet 2, Sections III and IV were calculated in accordance with ASOPs. The Federal AV Calculator was used to determine the AV Metal Values shown in Worksheet 2 of the Unified Rate Review Template for all plans. The Part I Unified Rate Review Template does not demonstrate the process used to develop the rates. Rather it represents information required by Federal regulation to be provided in support of the review of rate increases, for certification of qualified health plans for Federally facilitated exchanges and for certification that the index rate is developed in accordance with Federal regulation and used consistently and only adjusted by the allowable modifiers.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This memorandum documents the development of individual rates for MDwise. These rates will be offered inside of the State of Indiana's health insurance exchange, which is being operated by the federal government. MDwise is a notforprofit corporation that purchased 100% of the stock in IU Health Plan, Inc., a fully licensed HMO, (IUHP) on December 29, 2006. IUHP was merged into MDwise, Inc. as of January 1, 2007. MDwise remains a fully licensed Indiana domestic HMO. MDwise is jointly controlled by Indiana University Health, Inc. and Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County Indiana. The two parent companies are notforprofit, are incorporated in the State of Indiana, and are provider delivery system companies. Beginning January 1, 2011, MDwise was granted a fouryear contract with the State of Indiana (the \"State\"), through the Family and Social Service Administration (\"FSSA\") and Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (\"OMPP\"), to arrange for and administer two riskbased managed care programs (\"Hoosier Healthwise\" and \"Healthy Indiana Plan\") for certain Indiana Medicaid enrollees. MDwise contracts with various delivery networks. The delivery networks accept the medical service risk for enrollees who choose a primary care provider after selecting the MDwise network. There were approximately 280,000 members enrolled in the Hoosier Healthwise and Healthy Indiana Plan products at December 31, 2013. Under an Accountable Care Organization model, MDwise contracts with several integrated delivery systems to provide medical services and claims administration under risk contracts for their current business. MDwise has operated under this model since its inception. MDwise is offering two individual health insurance products in the Bronze and Silver metal tiers and one individual health insurance product in the Gold metal tier. Being a nonprofit health plan focused on low income individuals, MDwise expects most enrollment to be in the Silver plan, for individuals eligible for premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions. MDwise's mission is to provide health care services to the lower income population. One of the primary reasons that MDwise is entering the individual market within the health insurance exchange is to provide its Medicaid members with an MDwise product offering if they lose Medicaid eligibility. MDwise has applied for a new HMO license in the State of Indiana (MDwise Marketplace). Our filing is in the review process. MDwise anticipates it to be active in time for 2015 Open Enrollment season. MDwise has applied and received a new HIOS ID number of 62033.

GENERAL INFORMATION Company Legal Name: MDwise Marketplace, Inc. State: Indiana HIOS Issuer ID: 62033 Market: Individual Market Effective Date: January 1, 2015 Company Contact Information Primary Contact Name: Elizabeth Eichhorn Primary Contact Telephone Number: 3178227232 Primary Contact Email Address: Eeichhorn@mdwise.org 3. PROPOSED RATE INCREASES MDwise began selling individual policies with effective dates beginning January 2014. They did not previously participate in the individual market. The effective rate increase is 8.8% for 2015 for all proposed individual policies. This large increase is driven primarily by Indiana's transition from a 209(b) state to a 1634 state and the associated population expected to enroll in the individual market because of this change. 4. EXPERIENCE PERIOD PREMIUM AND CLAIMS, BENEFIT CATEGORIES AND PROJECTION FACTORS MDwise began selling individual policies with effective dates beginning January 2014. The effective rate increase for 2015 is 8.8% for all proposed individual policies. Because they did not participate in the individual or small group markets prior to 2014 and 2014 experience is not yet credible, the rate development is based entirely on a manual rate. MDwise Individual Product MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT 2015 Rate Filing Page 4 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. 5. MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT The basic manual rate development methodology is unchanged from the 2014 premium rate development. Updated market experience was not available at a sufficient level of detail to justify redeveloping the manual rate. Instead, we reflected emerging demographic and risk adjustment information in our morbidity assumptions and updated other assumptions that were different from 2014 including trend, the impact of reinsurance, benefit changes, leveraging of fixed cost sharing items and the addition of individuals expected to enroll in the Individual market starting in 2014 because of Indiana's transition from a 209(b) state to a 1634 state. The approach to premium rate development is as follows: 1. Paid and/or allowed PMPM medical costs were developed using market information including competitor rate filings, premium rates, and financial filings. If historic experience net of member cost sharing was used, paid to allowed ratios were estimated using the Wakely pricing model. Table C1 in Appendix C shows the various sources used for the small group source development. 2. Allowed PMPMs were adjusted for trend and ACA changes and requirements including EHB, pent up demand, morbidity changes between pre and post ACA enrollment and others described below. 3. The Wakely pricing model was calibrated to the adjusted allowed PMPMs and used to estimate paid to allowed ratios. Within a benefit plan offering, a consumer may choose to use providers in a preferred network of providers and receive reduced cost sharing, represented by Tier 1. If a consumer chooses instead to use nonpreferred providers, the cost sharing is greater, represented by Tier 2. They have been blended with a 90% weighting on Tier 1 and 10% on Tier 2, reflective of MDwise's expectations on actual utilization. The pricing by tier and blended result is shown in Appendix A. 4. Administrative costs and regulatory fees and taxes, along with contribution to surplus were added. Appendix C, Table C2 shows the components of the starting allowed PMPM shown in Appendix A. A comparison to the 2014 development is also provided. Source and Appropriateness of Experience Data Used The allowed PMPM target for post reform experience was developed using prereform small group market information. Even though the goal is to price individual products post reform, the post reform individual market may look more like the prereform small group market than the prereform individual market. Therefore, we reviewed rate filings and financial reports for Indiana small group products. We made adjustments for trend, benefit design, and others to adjust the allowed PMPM to the midpoint of the rating period.

Population Changes The manual rate incorporates results from the SOA study1 (performed by Optum/Lewin) to estimate changes in morbidity from the Indiana preACA market to that enrolled in Indiana post ACA. Results from other states and analyses, including those performed by Wakely were also reviewed, but the Lewin model framework was used. Wakely has performed detailed studies on behalf of individual states with broad health plan participation and detailed data collection. We have found some of the values provided by the health plans, high risk pool, and the state differ (sometimes significantly) from the values presented in the SOA study, which is reasonable given the different data sources used and differences in judgment likely between actuaries performing this type of modeling. We made adjustments and applied judgment with input from the health plan in developing the final estimates of how the post reform market would compare to the prereform market. The primary changes were to decrease the number of previously uninsured entering the market and to increase their assumed health status since the SOA values are targeted once the ACA has been fully implemented. Wakely also reviewed emerging results from the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Reporting study. This study included participation from Indiana issuers, including MDwise. The issuers reported claims and demographic based risk adjustment information through February 2014. The project will include updated information throughout 2014 which we will be reviewing as it becomes available. Emerging Indiana information caused us to increase our morbidity assumption by 2%. This is primarily driven by a higher age distribution than originally anticipated. This adjustment captures expected morbidity over and above allowable rating variation. An additional adjustment of 1.5% is made to account for the transition of individuals that had been covered under Indiana's Medicaid Spenddown program. In developing an assumption for the impact of this population on the market, Wakely considered information provided by the state regarding the population and emerging enrollment of this population into the exchange. The components of the Morbidity Adjustment are shown in Appendix C, Table C2. Appendix F provides the detail behind the base SOA tables and our adjustments to the SOA tables to develop the final morbidity adjustment factor in Appendix C (1.0039). Pent up demand and the 2014 strategic renewal impact adjustments are described in more detail below. Cost Adjustments We have made two adjustments to account for cost variances. Smoking Load - We adjusted the base period data by a factor of 0.9874 to create an index rate that is reflective of a nonsmoking population. 1 Web link (as of 442013): http://www.soa.org/NewlyInsured/ MDwise Individual Product MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT 2015 Rate Filing Page 6 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. Bad Debt - To account for the likelihood that some policy holders will not pay premiums within the grace period, we have increased rates by a factor of 1.00275. This is calculated assuming a 15% rate of nonpayment of one out of twelve months on about 22% of premium, after considering federal subsidies (.15 x .224 x 1/12 = .00275). Trend Factors (cost / utilization) We assumed PMPM medical costs would increase by 8% annually from 2012 to 2015 due to ongoing increases in utilization, unit costs and technology. This assumption is based on review of rate filings for Indiana and other states, national publicly available trend surveys, and judgment. These trends do not include the effect of demographics or benefits because those adjustments are included elsewhere. Essential Health Benefits (EHB) We adjusted the allowed claims sources in the manual rate development for expected changes in covered benefits due to EHB requirements, specific to individual and small group market starting cost sources. The following is not an allinclusive list but it highlights the benefits expected to have the most significant impacts on allowed costs: Maternity and prescription drug coverage. Mental health and substance abuse parity. Each health plan will need to understand what benefit changes, if any, are needed to bring their current benefits up to parity, especially if the selected EHB is not at parity. Habilitative services, if not defined by the state, need to be defined by the plan. The impact on claims can vary significantly depending on the definition of the benefit. Pediatric vision and dental must be offered under EHB although pediatric dental may be excluded if a standalone dental plan is offered on the Exchange. Each plan must determine the resulting costs of pediatric coverage. Adjustments for changing demographics, changes in benefits, and others were separately addressed and included in the premium rate development. To incorporate these adjustments we increased the small group market source by 2%. Provider Reimbursement Adjustment MDwise provided Wakely with provider contracting targets by plan (based on service area) for inpatient facility, outpatient facility and professional categories of service. Wakely analyzed these targets and compared them to market information regarding current commercial reimbursement rates. We assumed provider volume by provider system would be consistent with current MDwise Medicaid volume by provider system. The total adjustments to allowed cost varied by plan and are reflected in the geographic factors. MDwise Individual Product CREDIBILITY OF EXPERIENCE 2015 Rate Filing Page 7 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. Strategic Renewal Impact Many health plans were working to provide communication and incentive for individual policyholders to renew on 12/1/2013, 1/1/2014, or at their scheduled renewal. This type of strategic approach has been used in the past as states have implemented different state based reforms. This approach likely increased the average morbidity of individuals included in the risk adjustment pool in 2014. The healthy individuals will get a smaller rate increase under preACA policies due to rating for health status while the sicker individuals would get a better rate on ACA policies since they do not rate for health status. For 2015, the impact of strategic renewal would have disappeared but the administration allowed states to continue renewing these policies on preACA products and Indiana has allowed such policies (referred to as a transitional or \"grandmothering\"). We have been informed by the State of Indiana that approximately 20% or less of the market will renew transitional policies. We have included a 1% adjustment (1.01 factor) within our manual rate development for this (part of morbidity adjustment in Appendix C, Table C2). Pent Up Demand In 2014, there were many new enrollees in the individual market that were previously uninsured. Prior to enrolling in coverage, these people would have been paying out of pocket for any medical costs, and it can be assumed that they did not treat minor health problems or receive preventive care due to cost. Once they are covered in the Exchange, there may be an increase in utilization for this population as they will be more likely to afford to have minor issues treated and utilize preventive services. We expect very little remaining pent up demand in 2015. Therefore, we have removed the pent up demand effect and used a factor of 1.0 in Appendix C, Table C2. Inclusion of Capitation Payments While MDwise will pay the Delivery Systems a global cap rate (percentage of premium), the State of Indiana has required MDwise to report the underlying provider payments as the true medical costs to provide coverage in MDwise's financial statements. This is because the Delivery Systems are delegated a portion of the administrative costs associated with their members. Therefore, the capitation paid to the delivery systems is meant to cover direct medical costs, and provider overhead. Based on discussions between MDwise, CCIIO and the state of Indiana, we understand that this treatment will continue in 2014 and beyond. This is important because of the risk corridor protection and minimum loss ratio treatment, which affect the relative level of risk inherent in the premium rate development and overall delivery system payment amounts. 6. CREDIBILITY OF EXPERIENCE MDwise began operating in the individual market in 2014 and that experience is not yet credible. Per request from the State of Indiana Department of Insurance, we have entered projected 2014 information from last year's rate filing in the \"Experience Period\" section of Worksheet 1 of the URRT. However, the MDwise Individual Product PAID TO ALLOWED RATIO 2015 Rate Filing Page 8 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. projection factors (cells J24:M29 on Worksheet 1) have been left blank. The service category PMPMs shown in the \"Credibility Manual\" section of Worksheet 1 were developed based on the approach described above and assigned 100% credibility. 7. PAID TO ALLOWED RATIO The Wakely pricing model uses a nationally representative detailed medical and pharmacy claim and enrollment data (Truven MarketScan) for over 40 million lives to develop paid to allowed pricing estimates for final rate development (as opposed to metal tier categorization). The model uses actuarially sound pricing methods to value the impact of deductibles, copays, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket cost sharing parameters. We calibrated the utilization and unit cost assumptions by category of service in the model to the allowed cost estimates underlying the manual rate and/or experience rate, including adjustments for EHB, trend, provider reimbursement changes by service category, average expected demographics and other adjustments discussed elsewhere in this report. 8. RISK ADJUSTMENT AND REINSURANCE Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM We have developed manual rates for a 1.0 average statewide risk and assumed that MDwise would enroll average risk individuals. Therefore, no risk adjustment PMPM payment is assumed in 2015. Reinsurance The presence of the Federal reinsurance program will reduce costs for issuers in the individual market. This adjustment is intended to capture the portion of costs that will be reimbursed to health plans for reinsurance. The reinsurance payment parameters for 2015 were originally announced as an attachment point of $70,000, a reinsurance cap of $250,000, and a target coinsurance rate of 50%. In final regulations published in late May, CMS stated its intent to lower the 2015 attachment point to $45,000 and suggested the possibility of an adjustment to the 2015 target coinsurance rate. In rates developed for this filing, an attachment point of $45,000 has been assumed. We have assumed no change to the target coinsurance rate of 50%. To estimate the impact of reinsurance, we reviewed several claims probability distributions (CPDs) from different sources, adjusted to our estimated allowed PMPMs. To estimate the impact of moving from allowed to paid continuance, we increased the attachment and maximum values from the federal parameters by the MOOP for various plans, since the vast majority of individuals would have already reached their MOOP when costs reach the reinsurance attachment point. Our estimates are very sensitive to the shape of the CPD, the overall allowed cost PMPM that the CPD is calibrated to, as well as the MOOP and underlying Actuarial Value of the plan. Based on sensitivity testing, we have assumed that the average reinsurance impact will be a 9.6% reduction to net allowed claims costs (11.1% to paid claims). This adjustment was applied uniformly across all benefit plan packages. We have assumed that the allocated MDwise Individual Product NONBENEFIT EXPENSES AND PROFIT & RISK 2015 Rate Filing Page 9 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. federal reinsurance dollars will be sufficient to fund the federal reinsurance program in 2015, which is not guaranteed. 9. NONBENEFIT EXPENSES AND PROFIT & RISK Administrative Expense Load MDwise developed expected administrative costs based on current administrative costs for their Medicaid line of business, adjusted to reflect any differences in functions or level of effort for the commercial product. MDwise assumed a 50% of administrative expenses would increase by 3% from 2014 on a PMPM basis while 50% would increase with premium rates. For the small service areas, the PMPM component was increased to spread fixed costs across a small member cohort. Contribution to Surplus & Risk Margin Three percent (3%) of premiums has been allocated to contribution to surplus. Taxes and Fees Taxes and regulatory fees include the following: 1. PCORI Fee = $0.17 PMPM 2. Issuer Fee = It is not clear if MDwise will be exempt from the issuer fee in 2015. We have assumed they will be subject to the fee in this filing at 2.0%. 3. Health Insurance Exchange Fee = 3.5% of premium for products sold through the Exchange. MDwise expects the vast majority of their business to be sold through the exchange and we have included the full 3.5% load in premium rate development. Please note that in the URRT taxes and fees section, the risk adjustment and reinsurance fees have been excluded. Reinsurance and Risk Adjustment Fees The following fees were netted out of the experience in the URRT. 1. Reinsurance Charge = $3.67 PMPM 2. Risk Adjustment User Fee = $1.00 PMPY ($0.08 PMPM) 10. PROJECTED LOSS RATIO Wakely's estimates indicate projected MLRs for the individual line of business of 82.0% for 2015. Consistent with the MLR and Risk Corridor calculations, regulatory fees and taxes were excluded from premium in the calculation of this value. MDwise Individual Product SINGLE RISK POOL 2015 Rate Filing Page 10 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. 11. SINGLE RISK POOL MDwise has established a single risk pool for all of its individual business. Since MDwise did not participate in the individual market prior to 2014, all of its individual business is nongrandfathered, nontransitional, and ACAcompliant. 12. INDEX RATE Index Rate for Projection Period The starting allowed claim index of $650.20 is developed from the historical claim index rate of the Indiana Small Group Market. Appendix C, Table C2 illustrates this development. The bullet points below briefly describe specific line items in Table C2. For comparative purposes, the adjustment for average percentage of smokers has been retained in the table. Per CCIIO instructions, the adjustment for the smoker load should not be included in the starting allowed claim cost, so to calculate the $650.20 the factor is excluded. Base Period Allowed PMPM - These historical claim index rates are developed from publicly available information. Cost Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for cost differences between the base period and projected period and include an adjustment for the expected bad debt that is introduced by the grace period. Benefit Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for differences between the base period benefits and those offered under the exchange as essential health benefits. Morbidity Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for differences in the morbidity of the population underlying the base period allowed PMPM and the population expected in the exchange market. Included in this adjustment are considerations for morbidity and demographic differences, pentup demand, and the impact of transitional policies. Trend factor - We used an assumed trend of 8.0% over 30 months to trend the base period data to a midpoint of 7/1/2015. Allowed Claim Index Rate by Source - The allowed claim index rate is calculated as the product of the historical claim index rate and all the factors listed above in this section. Market Adjusted Index Rate We included the impact of reinsurance and risk adjustment and the exchange user fee to the index rate for the projection period to develop the market adjusted index rate. The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item g. MDwise Individual Product AV METAL LEVELS 2015 Rate Filing Page 11 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. Plan Adjusted Index Rate To bring the experience used in the manual rating to a \"nontobacco\" basis, a downward adjustment is applied using a factor of 0.9874. Among the items contemplated when setting this assumption were the rates of tobacco use in Indiana as well as the proportion of people who will selfreport as \"Smokers.\" We multiplied the market adjusted rate by provider contracting discounts, the actuarial value and the federal induced demand factors. We then included the admin, commissions, ACA fees, tax, and profit margin. The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item v. Calibration To bring the experience to age 21 rate, we divided the plan adjusted index rate by the weighted average age factor. The age factor was calculated as the weighted average of ACA age factors and the 2015 expected individual enrollment by age. The average age is approximately 50 years. The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item w. Consumer Adjusted Index Rate The consumer adjusted index rates are calculated by multiplying the calibrated plan adjusted index rates by the consumer's specific age factor, area, and tobacco status. As last year's restrictions on the smoker load (limiting smoker loaded rates to the same 3:1 limit as nonsmoker rates) have been removed, the loads have been change and are shown in Appendix D. Using the age factors and smoking load Area Factors in Appendix D, one can take the index rate from Appendix A and develop the rates for each product and age combination. Two examples are provided in Appendix E. 13. AV METAL LEVELS The Federal AVC was used without modification to generate the AV metal tier (column b on Appendix A). The Federal AVCs were as follows: Bronze A 61.8% Silver A (base) 68.1% Silver B (73% CSR) 73.8% MDwise Individual Product AV PRICING VALUES 2015 Rate Filing Page 12 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. Silver B (87% CSR) 86.1% Silver B (94% CSR) 93.0% 14. AV PRICING VALUES The reference plan underlying our pricing was a Silver plan. From this base PMPM, we applied benefit richness utilization adjustments to stratify this PMPM to levels suitable for each of the metal tiers. We used the following values which are equal to the Federal values published in the Federal Register payment notice, normalized to the silver benefit level: Bronze = 1.00 / 1.03 = 0.9709 Silver = 1.03 / 1.03 = 1.0000 Gold = 1.08 / 1.03 = 1.0485 MDwise is not offering Platinum or Catastrophic plans. The adjustment factors above are shown in Appendix A, column o. The same underlying cost distribution and cost level was used. The only adjustment before determining AV pricing values was benefit richness utilization differences using Federal adjustment factors. Therefore, differences in expected morbidity across metal tiers were not included in the pricing development for each metal tier plan. These adjustments do not incorporate a selection bias due to health status. Rather, they represent an adjustment due to any particular individual utilizing services differently when they have a richer or less rich benefit design. The pricing AVs are higher than the Federal AVCs primarily because the estimated allowed PMPMs are higher than those underlying the Federal AV calculator. This is due to a leveraging effect for fixed cost sharing elements like copays, deductibles and MOOPs. This effect is more pronounced in 2015 than it was in 2014 because of the morbidity increases assumed due to the addition of the high risk population (conversion from 209(b) to 1634) and the higher age distribution. 15. MEMBERSHIP PROJECTIONS The membership projections for 2015 were developed by Wakely in consultation with MDwise based on emerging enrollment and expected new enrollment for 2015. Appendix B shows estimates of the Cost Sharing Reduction by Silver base and Silver variant level. We used the Federal formula shown in the Advance Payment Notice, which is equal to the difference in AVC MDwise Individual Product TERMINATED PRODUCTS 2015 Rate Filing Page 13 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. multiplied by the allowed cost PMPM for each base plan, increased by 1.12 for cost sharing utilization for the 87% and 94% variants. 16. TERMINATED PRODUCTS MDwise began selling individual policies with effective dates beginning January 1, 2014. They have no prior products to terminate. 17. PLAN TYPE MDwise is filing HMO products. 18. URRT WARNINGS There were no warnings in the URRT. 19. RELIANCE Wakely Consulting Group, Inc., 9777 Pyramid Ct, Suite 260, Englewood, CO 80112 relied on information provided by MDwise to develop the 2014 individual premium rates. This information includes, but is not limited to the following: Provider contracting levels, including descriptions of the relationship between the Delivery systems and MDwise Administrative cost projections Projected enrollment figures by QHP Product design information Provider network information including discount data CCIIO and the State of Indiana regulatory and compliance interpretations and rulings Commercial rate filings and financial reports of carriers participating in the preACA market. 20. ACTUARIAL CERTIFICATION I, Ross Winkelman, am a Fellow in the Society of Actuaries (FSA) and a member of the American Academy of Actuaries (MAAA). I meet the Qualification Standards of Actuarial Opinion as adopted by the American Academy of Actuaries. MDwise Individual Product ACTUARIAL CERTIFICATION 2015 Rate Filing Page 14 \u00a9 2014 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietary. The submission is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidance of the Federal government and the state of Indiana as of July 25, 2014. The submission is in compliance with the appropriate Actuarial Standards of Practice (ASOP's) including: ASOP No. 5, Incurred Health and Disability Claims ASOP No. 8, Regulatory Filings for Health Plan Entities ASOP No. 12, Risk Classification ASOP No. 23, Data Quality ASOP No. 25, Credibility Procedures Applicable to Accident and Health, Group Term Life, and Property/Casualty Coverages ASOP No. 41, Actuarial Communication In my opinion, the premiums are reasonable in relation to the benefits provided and the population anticipated to be covered. Further, the premiums are not excessive nor deficient although actual experience may vary from the estimates inherent in the premium rate development. The index rate and only the allowable modifiers as described in 45 CFR 156.80(d)(1) and 45 CFR 156.80(d)(2) were used to generate plan level rates. The percent of total premium that represents essential health benefits included in Worksheet 2, Sections III and IV were calculated in accordance with ASOPs. The Federal AV Calculator was used to determine the AV Metal Values shown in Worksheet 2 of the Unified Rate Review Template for all plans. The Part I Unified Rate Review Template does not demonstrate the process used to develop the rates. Rather it represents information required by Federal regulation to be provided in support of the review of rate increases, for certification of qualified health plans for Federally facilitated exchanges and for certification that the index rate is developed in accordance with Federal regulation and used consistently and only adjusted by the allowable modifiers.

June 6, 2014 Karl Knable Indiana Department of Insurance Indianapolis, Indiana Dear Karl, We appreciate the quick and thorough review of the filing. The questions raised below have highlighted areas that we'd like to address through revision of our rates. As you know, MDwise has received more information from the state regarding the spend -down population that may support a decrease in the adjustment included in our initial submission. Additionally, MDwise is participating in the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Reporting (WNRAR) project. We expect results from that project in the coming weeks. We anticipate that t he results will help us refine the general morbidity assumption and the impact of the transition plans. In each case, we expect the changes to result in lower premiums. Please let us know if you'd like to discuss this general approa ch. Below you will find the objections you sent with our responses. Also, we have attached a revised Appendix A. 1. We will need to see your current enrollment data including count, premium and demographics. Please see the spreadsheet attached to the object ion response. 2. You indicate that the trend is 8%, please provide some documentation for this value. The actuarial memorandum indicates we used two reference points and judgment for setting the trend assumption. The first reference point is rate filings. The rate filings in Indiana we reviewed showed annual PMPM medical cost trend assumptions ranging from 6.8% to 12% with a subscriber -weighted average of 9.6%. The second reference point is national trend surveys. The 2014 Segal Health Plan Cost Trend Su rvey states \"Health plan cost trend rates show the slowest growth in 14 years of trend forecasts\". Segal estimates trends for HMOs to be 7.2% without Rx and 7.0% with Rx. We considered the information gathered from these reference points to set the trend at 8%. 3. Please provide a demonstration of how the .8962 factor was determined for the impact of reinsurance. Wakely developed a reinsurance model to calculate the percentage impact of reinsurance based on the reinsurance parameters an d an expected allowed cost. The model relies on a continuance table of medical and pharmacy costs from the Truven MarketScan data, calibrated to pricing allowed costs. The percentage from that model is then applied to the allowed costs across the va rious QHPs and metal level s. The .8962 is a projected member month -weighted average of the various impact factors. As explained in our response to question #6, we are sending a revised Appendix A, and this number will now be 0.9111. This change does not impact the premiums. 2 4. From Section 5, please provide numerical justification for benefit adjustment (1.02), morbidity (1.1545), demographic (1.0692) and strategic renewal impact (1.1). The 10% impact due to renewal strategies seems high. The benefit adjustment infuses into the ba se period allowed PMPM the cost of covering essential health benefits that may not have been previously covered under small group plans. The 1.02 factor is consistent with Wakely's best estimate from work in other states and includes estimates for each of the following benefit changes: Additional PMPM Benefit Low High Maternity and prescription drug coverage $0.40 $0.65 Mental health and substance abuse parity $0.10 $0.30 Services $3.00 Total $6.25 $10.20 The morbidity factor of 1.1545 is made up of two parts. The first is a factor of 1.0039 and its development is shown in Appe ndix F. The second part is a 15% adjustment to account for the increased costs from the Medicaid Spend down population. This is based on an analysis performed by Wakely which relied heavily on a report by Milliman. The Milliman report indicated a poten tial impact as 5% -10%. A primary driver in our higher estimate is a different assumption for conve rting Medicaid costs to commercial equivalent costs. The morbidity factor in table C -2 line (d) is 1.0039 * 1.15, or 1.1545. As more information has been released regarding this population since this rate filing, Wakely would like to make changes to this assumption in a revised submission. The demographic factor is derived from two factors. The first is a factor of 1.0381 which was used as part of the 2014 filin g that was calculated to show the difference between the current market and the expected marke t. Now that we have information regarding the actual demographics of those enrolling in the exchange and that they are older than originally expected, we are increasing that factor by 1.03. The product of the two is the 1.0692 factor. This demographic f actor represents additional expected morbidity due to older individuals enrolling than were in base period data, outside of allowable rate variation (3:1 age factors). The strategic renewal impact of 1.1 is our current best estimate, based on theoretic al modeling but very little data because such data is not available yet. The Wakely National Risk Adjustment Reporting project results with data through April will become available in the coming weeks and should provide detailed, quantitative information so that we can develop a more credible estimate. Wakely would like to make changes to this factor in a revised submission if this new information supports a differ ent assumption. 5. With regard to the market demographic factor of 1.2298, how is this differen t from the morbidity adjustment? This demographic factor is based on the difference between the base period market demographics and the actual market demographics as can be rated for using the HHS age factors. The demographics under the morbidity section reflect that there may be increased/decreases risk that cannot be captured with allowable rating factors because the age factors are limited to 3 to 1. 6. From Section 5, please provide an example of how you get from the $810.19 to $407.40 for the first list ed plan. We are including a revised Appendix A that will outline how to get from the Starting Allowed PMPM to the Composite PMPM. The previous version used weighted averages that didn't allow for the calculations to be done using the provided numbers. The revised Appendix A will allow you to follow the calculation. The correction meets the requirement in the actuarial memorandu m instructions that the impact of reinsurance and exchange user fee be shown as the same amount for all plans. Plan difference s are now reflected in the benefit plan differences. This change does not impact the final premiums. 3 7. In Appendix A, the exchange user fee impact is $12.27, how is this allocated between on and off exchange and how the 12.27 is determined. The exchange u ser fee is 3.5% of total premiums. The $12.27 represents 3.5% of the expected total premium under the filed assumptions at a 1.0 age factor. As mentioned in response to question #6, we are sending a revised Appendix A and the new amount will be $21.24. This change does not impact the final premiums. MDwise is not going to be actively marketing it's off exchange program and therefore expects no material enrollment off the exchange. As a result, the 3.5% is not reduced for any off -exchange enrollment. 8. You mention a factor of 1.0339 on page 4 to be used in Appendix C, can you help me track this? The 1.0339 is a typo in the documentation (no impact to rates). The factor should be 1.0039. This factor's development is s hown in Appendix F. Then, in Appen dix C, this factor is combined with a 15% adjustment to morbidity to account for the increased costs from the transitioning Medicaid Spend down population. The morbidity factor in table C -2 line (d) is 1.0039 * 1.15, or 1.1545. 9. With regard to risk adjustm ent, can you discuss why you think there will not be a risk adjustment impact on the rates while considering the Medicaid spend down and the additional HIV population. We have developed manual rates for a 1.0 average statewide risk and assumed that MDwise would enroll average risk individuals. We have assumed there will not be a bias among the Medicaid Spend down and additional HIV populations when they select a product; therefore, MDwise's risk will remain similar to that of the market as a whole. While it is unlikely MDwise will enroll an average population, it is very uncertain if the population will be healthier or sicker than average and we assume risk adjust ment will adjust for differences from average risk. Therefore, any assumptions regarding MDw ise's population being different than average would include an equal adjustment to medical expenses and revenue and have no effect on premium rates. 10. I don't see any documentation for the provider contracting adjustment. The rate development included an ad justment for provider contracting as compared to existing, statewide average assumed contracting levels. Factors are developed by comparing the relativities of assumed market contracting rates underlying marke t experience from rate filings and financial s tatements to MDwise's contracting levels. For example, we've assumed that facilities are reimbursed at x% of Medicare and that professionals are reimbursed at y% of Medicare in the commercial market underlying the 2012 base period PMPMs from rate filings and financial statements (i.e. our starting PMPM). The provider discounts are then determined by taking MDwise's contracts, let's say a% for facility and b% for professional, as a ratio to those assumptions, so a%/x% and b%/y%. Those ratios are then blen ded by the expected mix of services between facility and professional and for other categories such as prescription drug. 11. I don't see any documentation for the tobacco adjustment of .9874. Wakely assumed an average smoker load of 1.20 and a non -smoker loa d of 1.0 for the various plans used in developing the base period allowed PMPM. A report from Indiana ( http://www.in.gov/isdh/tpc/files/IN_Adult_Smoking_NOV2012.pdf ) indicates that there is a smoking prevalence of 25.6% in Indiana. We reduced that amount by 75% to reflect that not all smokers will be self-reporting when purchasing insurance. A blend of the two loads, assuming 6.4% for smokers (25.6% * .25) results in a factor of 1.0128. We then backed this out of the base period allowed PMPM by using the factor 0.9874 (1/1.0128). 12. Where is the cost sharing utilization explained or derived? The adjustments are equal to the factors provided in Table 11 on page number 15433 of the \"Federal Register Vol. 78, No. 47 Monday, March 11, 2013 Rules and Regulations\" but relative to the silver metal tier factor. For example, in the table the fa ctor for the Gold metal tier is 1.08 and the Silver metal tier is 1.03. The adjustment for the Gold plans is then 1.08 divided by 1.03 (1.0485). Per ACA requirements, these adjustments do not include a selection bias due to health status. 4 13. Please provide more detail around the development of each of the fees in the bottom half of Appendix A, such as Fixed Admin, Variable Admin, PMPM regulatory fees, and Other Fees. Fixed Admin - This amount was calculated by trending the prior year fixed admin amount forward by 3%. On a 1.0 age basis, that is $18.27 * 1.03 = 18.82 (with our assumed 1.75 age fact or this number is $32.94). This is the number used for Service Area 1. That fixed admin amount is adjusted for the other service areas with lower membership as the cost is spread out over fewe r members. Variable Admin - This amount is set so that the var iable admin amount will be a percentage of premium consistent with the 2014 filing, or 6.8%. PMPM Regulatory Fees - This is calculated as the sum of the Reinsurance of $3.67, the Risk Adjustment User Fee of $0.08, and the PCORI fee of $0.25. These amoun ts are shown in section 9 of the actuarial memorandum. Other Fees - This includes 3.5% for the Exchange User Fee and 2.0% for the Issuer Fee. The $33.37 is 5.5% of the Plan Adjusted Index Rate of $606.74. 14. You performed an age calibration to get the 1.75 f actor, please provide the detail. MDwise is participating in the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Reporting (WNRAR) project. The Indiana issuers are submitting risk adjustment and demographic only information to Wakely periodically during 2014. The 1.75 age factor is based on demographic only submissions with data through March and an estimate of additional enrollment subsequent to those submissions. The state wide individual market demographic factor for post ACA business is higher, but we anticipate ad ditional enrollment at the younger ages. The 1.75 is based on this adjusted expected distribution of enrollment and HHS age factors. 15. In the EHB explanation, you state that there was an impact for State mandated benefits that only applied to group covera ge. Since you started with group rates, have you backed this out somewhere else? We will revise the wording in this section to remove this bullet point as it is a carryover from the initial 2014 Actuarial Memorandum. The statement applied to any Individu al market sources, indicating that they would need to be adjusted, while the Small Group market sources did not. 16. You discuss the inclusion of capitation payments, please discuss this including the values shown in the URRT for each of the benefit categories . Under the MDwise financial structure, the participating delivery systems are the risk bearing entities. They are paid a perc entage of revenue, with MDwise retaining a portion for its administrative costs. We have developed the rates using the expected true medical costs as opposed to expected capitation payouts to the delivery systems since this is how MDwise is required to repor t their financial statements and reflects the true costs of providing the coverage. The statement regarding capitation in th e actuarial memorandum refers to this. The capitation amount shown on the URRT refers to the standard capitation concept of medical services that are capitated. 17. In the URRT, you use a Paid to Allowed factor of .765. Can you provide some documentation on how this was developed? This ratio is the same as shown in column O of Appendix A. It is developed by running the benefit plan designs through the Wakely Benefit Pricer to determine the plan AVs. 18. Can you show how you get to the $51.14 reinsurance facto r in the URRT from the 7.9% reduction in claim costs mentioned in Section 8? As mentioned in our response to question 6, because of the way we displayed Appendix A with weighted averages, other amounts we have used cannot be directly calculated. We are s ending a revised Appendix A that will allow you to follow the calculation. The correction meets the requirement in the actuarial memorandum instructions that the impact of reinsurance and exchange use r fee be shown as the same amount for all plans. Plan differences are now reflected in the benefit plan differences. The new number is $42.71 and is included in column (aa) of the revised version of Appendix A which is included with this letter. It can be calculated in the following manner. From Appendix A , calculate the product of the values in columns (c), (h), (i), (j), and (o). From Appendix A, calculate the product of the values in columns (c), (h), (i), (j), (o), and (d). 5 Subtract the value found in step 2 from step 1 and then subtract out the reinsurance fee of 3.67. Weight the results of those steps for each row of Appendix A by the projected member months (column z) to get the result. 19. Last year MDwise was exempt from the issuer fee. Show projections of how you think they will be impacted for this year and what that impact is. MDwise believes that the 2014 Marketplace premiums will exceed 20% of total MDwise premiums, thereby eliminating the existing non -profit exempti on that MDwise benefitted from in the 2014 filing. Because of this, we have estimated an impact of 2% on premiums, based upon national estimates of the issuer fee. As you know, MDwise has applied for licensure of a separate, wholly owned, HMO. If this license is granted, MDwise anticipates transferring the existing Marketplace membership into that HMO, which may reduce the amount of issuer tax owed and potentially allow a reduction in the 2015 premiums. 20. The PCORI fee looks high. For plan years ending in any fiscal year beginning on or after Oct. 1, 2014, the fee is indexed for medical inflation. We will revise our estimate to reflect an increase of just 3%, so the new amount will be $0.17. This change will lower the premiums slightl y. We will make t his change when we make the other pricing changes for spend down and overall morbidity. 21. Please break out the calculation of the MLR showing the pieces in the numerator and denominator. This can be done using the Total/Average row of Appendix A. The numer ator is column (p) ($475.61) and the denominator is the sum of column (v) less the sums of columns (s) and (t) ($606.74 - $4.00 - $33.37). 22. For this year in worksheet I of the URRT, please provide PMPM for the premium based on 2014 current rates and show the index rate from last year's filing. The image below contains the section in the URRT with the amounts you requested. If this is what you are expecting to see, l et us know and we will revise when we resend the URRT. 23. In the URRT, the drug and hospital PMPM seem high compared to what most carriers are using. Can you discuss why you are comfortable with these factors? Since our overall manual rate didn't change from the 2014 development except for trend from 2014 to 201 5, we did not change the allocation by service category. Our updated pricing model using Truven MarketScan data shows a lower hospital PMPM and pharmacy cost PMPM. We will submit a revised URRT with manual rate updated as part of the updated pricing mode l. This change will impact each of the service categories. This change will have no effect on pricing as we used the Truven Marketsc an based pricing model to develop the pricing AVs. Please let us know if there are any further questions or concerns.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This memorandum documents the development of individual rates for MDwise. These rates will be offered inside of the State of Indiana's health insurance exchange, which is being operated by the federal government. MDwise is a not -for-profit corporation that purchased 100% of the stock in IU Health Plan, Inc., a fully licensed HMO, (IUHP) on December 29, 2006. IUHP was merged into MDwise, Inc. as of January 1, 2007. MDwise remains a fully licensed Indiana domestic HMO. MDwise is jointly controlled by Indiana University Health, Inc. and Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County Indiana. The two parent companies are not-for-profit, are incorporated in the State of Indiana, and are provider deliv ery system companies. Beginning January 1, 2011, MDwise was granted a four -year contract with the State of Indiana (the \"State\"), through the Family and Social Service Administration (\"FSSA\") and Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (\"OMPP\"), to arrange for and administer two risk -based managed care programs (\"Hoosier Healthwise\" and \"Healthy Indiana Plan\") for certain Indiana Medicaid enrollees. MDwise contracts with various delivery networks. The delivery networks accept the medical service risk for enr ollees who choose a primary care provider after selecting the MDwise network. There were approximately 280,000 members enrolled in the Hoosier Healthwise and Healthy Indiana Plan products at December 31, 2013. Under an Accountable Care Organization model, MDwise contracts with several integrated delivery systems to provide medical services and claims administration under risk contracts for their current business. MDwise has operated under this model since its inception. MDwise is offering two individual he alth insurance products in the Bronze and Silver metal tiers and one individual health insurance product in the Gold metal tier. Being a non -profit health plan focused on low income individuals, MDwise expects most enrollment to be in the Silver plan, for individuals eligible for premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions. MDwise's mission is to provide health care services to the lower income population. One of the primary reasons that MDwise is entering the individual market within the health insur ance exchange is to provide its Medicaid members with a n MDwise product offering if they lose Medicaid eligibility. MDwise has applied for a new HMO license in the State of Indiana (MDwise Marketplace). Our filing is in the review process. MDwise anticipates it to be active in time for 2015 Open Enrollment season. MD wise has applied and received a new HIOS ID number of 62033.

GENERAL INFORMATION Company Legal Name : MDwise Marketplace , Inc.

PROPOSED RATE INCREASES MDwise began selling individual policies with effective dates beginning January 20 14. They did not previously participate in the individual market. The effective rate increase is 35% for 2015 for all proposed individual policies. This large increase is driven primarily by Indiana's transition from a 209(b) state to a 1634 state and the associated population expected to enroll in the individual market because of this change . 4. EXPERIENCE PERIOD PREMIUM AND CLAIMS , BENEFIT CATEGORIES AND PROJECTION FACTORS MDwise began selling individual policies with effective dates beginning January 2014. The effective rate increase for 2015 is 35% for all proposed individual policies. Because they did not participate in the individual or small group markets prior to 2014 and 2014 experienc e is not yet credible , the rate development is based entirely on a manual rate. MDwise Individual Product MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT 2015 Rate Filing Page 4 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. 5. MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT The basic manual rate development methodology is unchanged from the 2014 premium rate development. Updated market experience was not available at a sufficient level of detail to justify redevelop ing the manual rate . Instead, we reflected emerging demographic and risk adjustment information in our mo rbidity assumptions and updated other assumptions that were different from 2014 including trend, the impact of reinsurance, benefit changes, leveraging of fixed cost sharing items and the addition of individuals expected to enroll in the Individual market starting in 2014 because of Indiana's transition from a 209(b) state to a 1634 state . The approach to premium rate development is as follows: 1. Paid and/or allowed PMPM medical costs were developed using market information including competitor rate filings, premium rates, and financial filings. If historic experience net of member cost sharing was used, paid to allowed ratios were estimated using the Wakely pricing model. Table C -1 in Appendix C shows the various sources used for the small group source deve lopment . 2. Allowed PMPMs were adjusted for trend and ACA changes and requirements including EHB, pent up demand, morbidity changes between pre and post ACA enrollment and others described below. 3. The Wakely pricing model was calibrated to the adjusted allowed PMPMs and used to estimate paid to allowed ratios. Within a benefit plan offering, a consumer may choose to use providers in a preferred network of providers and receive reduced cost sharing, represented by Tier 1. If a consumer chooses instead to use n on-preferred providers, the cost sharing is greater, represented by Tier 2. They have been blended with a 90% weighting on Tier 1 and 10% on Tier 2, reflective of MDwise's expectations on actual utilization. The pricing by tier and blended result is show n in Appendix A. 4. Administrative costs and regulatory fees and taxes, along with contribution to surplus were added. Appendix C, Table C -2 shows the components of the starting allowed PMPM shown in Appendix A. A comparison to the 2014 development is also provided. Source and Appropriateness of Experience Data Used The allowed PMPM target for post reform experience was developed usi ng pre-reform small group market information. Even though the goal is to price individual products post reform, the post reform individual market may look more like the pre -reform small group market than the pre -reform individual market. Therefore, we reviewed rate filings and financial reports for Indiana small group products . We made adjustments for trend, benefit design, and others to adjust the allowed PMPM to the midpoint of the rating period. MDwise Individual Product MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT 2015 Rate Filing Page 5 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. Population Changes The manual rate incorporates results from the SOA study1 (performed by Optum/Lewin) to estimate changes in morbidity from the Indiana pre-ACA market to that enrolled in Indiana post ACA. Results from other states and analyses, including those performed by Wakely were also reviewed , but the Lewin model framework was used . Wakely has performed detailed studies on behalf of individual sta tes with broad health plan participation and detailed data collection. We have found some of the values provided by the health plans, high risk pool, and the state differ (sometimes significantly) from the values presented in the SOA study, which is reaso nable given the different data sources used and differences in judgment likely between actuaries performing this type of modeling. We made adjustments and applied judgment with input from the health plan in developing the final estimates of how the post r eform market would co mpare to the pre -reform market. The primary changes were to decrease the number of previously uninsured entering the market and to increase their assumed health status since the SOA values are targeted once the ACA has been fully impl emented. Wakely also reviewed emerging results from the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Reporting study. This study included participation from Indiana issuers , including MDwise . The issuers reported claims and demographic based risk adjustment informa tion through February 2014. The project will include updated information throughout 2014 which we will be reviewing as it becomes available. Emerging Indiana information caused us to increase our morbidity assumption by 3%. This is primarily driven by a higher age distribution than originally anticipated. This adjustment captures expected morbidity over and above allowable rating variation. The components of the Morbidity Adjustment are shown in Appendix C, Table C-2. Appendix F provides the detai l behind the base SOA tables and our adjustments to the SOA tables to develop the final morbidity adjustment factor in Appendix C (1.0 339). Pent up demand and the 2014 strategic renewal impact adjustments are described in more detail below. Cost Adjustme nts We have made two adjustments to account for cost variances. Smoking Load - We adjusted the base period data by a factor of 0.9874 to create an index rate that is reflective of a non -smoking population. Bad Debt - To account for the likelihood that some policy holders will not pay premiums within the grace period, we have increased rates by a factor of 1.00275. This is calculated assuming a 15% rate of non -payment of one out of twelve months on about 22% of premium, after consider ing federal subsidies (.15 x .224 x 1/12 = .00275). 1 Web link (as of 4 -4-2013): http://www.soa.org/NewlyInsured/ MDwise Individual Product MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT 2015 Rate Filing Page 6 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. Trend Factors (cost / utilization) We assumed PMPM medical costs would increase by 8% annually from 2012 to 2015 due to ongoing increases in utilization, unit costs and technology. This assumption is based on review of rate fi lings for Indiana and other states, national publicly available trend surveys, and judgment. These trends do not include the effect of demographics or benefits because those adjustments are included elsewhere. Essential Health Benefits (EHB) We adjusted th e allowed claims sources in the manual rate development for expected changes in covered benefits due to EHB requirements , specific to individual and small group market starting cost sources . The following is not an all -inclusive list but it highlights the benefits expected to have the most significant impact s on allowed costs: Maternity and prescription drug coverage. State mandated benefits included in the EHB that previously only applied to group coverage. Mental health and substance abuse parity. Each health plan will need to understand what benefit changes, if any, are needed to bring their current benefits up to parity, especially if the selected EHB is not at parity. Habilitative services, if not defined by the state, need to be defined by the plan. The impact on claims can vary significantly depending on the definition of the benefit. Pediatric vision and dental must be offered under EHB although pediatric dental may be excluded if a stand -alone dental plan is offered on the Exchange. Each plan must determine the resulting c osts of pediatric coverage. Adjustments for changing demographics, changes in benefits, and others were separately addressed and included in the premium rate development. To incorporate these adj ustments w e increased the small group market source by 2%. Provider Reimbursement Adjustment MDwise provided Wakely with provider contracting targets by plan (based on service area) for inpatient facility, outpatient facility and professional categories o f service . Wakely analyzed these targets and compared them to market info rmation regarding current commercial reimbursement rates. We assumed provider volume by provider system would be consistent with current MDwise Medicaid volume by provider system. The total adjustments to allowed cost varied by plan and are reflected in the geographic factors . Strategic Renewal Impact Many health plans were working to provide communication and incentive for individual policyholders to renew on 12/1/2013, 1/1/2014, o r at their scheduled renewal. This type of strategic approach has been used in the past as states have implemented different state based reforms. This approach likely increase d the average morbidity of individual s included in the risk adjustment pool in 2014. The healthy individuals MDwise Individual Product CREDIBILITY OF EXPERIENCE 2015 Rate Filing Page 7 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. will get a smaller rate increase under pre -ACA policies due to rating for health status while the sicker individuals would get a better rate on ACA policies since they do not rate for health status. For 2015, the impact of str ategic renewal would have disappeared but the administration allowed states to continue renewing these policies on pre -ACA products and Indiana has allowed such policies (referred to as a transitional or \"grandmothering\"). We have included a 10% adjus tment (1.10 factor) within our manual rate development for this (part of morbidity adjustment in Appendix C, Table C-2). Pent Up Demand In 2014, t here were many new enrollees in the individual market that were previously uninsured. Prior to enrolling in coverage, these people would have been paying out of pocket for any medical costs, and it can be assumed that they did not treat minor health problems or receive preventive care due to cost. Once they are covered in the Exchange , there may be an increase in utilization for this population as they will be more likely to afford to have minor issues treated and utilize preventive services . We expect very little rem aining pent up demand in 2015 . Therefore, we have removed the pent up demand effect and used a factor of 1.0 in Appendix C, Table C-2. Inclusion of Capitation Payments While MDwise will pay the Delivery Systems a global cap rate (percentage of premi um), the State of Indiana has required MDwise to report the underlying provider payments as the true medical costs to provide coverage in MDwise's financial statements . This is because the Delivery Systems are delegated a portion of the administrative cos ts associated with their members. Therefore, the capitation paid to the delivery systems is meant to cover direct medical costs, and provider overhead . Based on discussions between MDwise, CCIIO and the state of Indiana, we understand that this treatment will continue in 2014 and beyond. This is important because of the risk corridor protection and minimum loss ratio treatment, which affect the relative level of risk inherent in the premium rate development and overall delivery system payment amounts. 6. CRE DIBILITY OF EXPERIENCE MDwise began operating in the individual market in 2014 and that experience is not yet credible . As a result , the \"Experience Period\" section of Worksheet 1 of the URRT has not been populated. Similarly, the projection factors (cel ls J24:M29 on Worksheet 1) ha ve also been left blank. The service category PMPMs shown in the \"Credibility Manual\" section of Worksheet 1 were developed based on the approach described above and assigned 100% credibility . MDwise Individual Product PAID TO ALLOWED RATIO 2015 Rate Filing Page 8 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. 7. PAID TO ALLOWED RATIO The Wakel y pricing model uses a nationally -representative detailed medical and pharmacy claim and enrollment data (Truven MarketScan) for over 40 million lives to develop paid to allowed pricing estimates for final rate development (as opposed to metal tier categorization). The model uses actuarially sound pricing methods to value the impact of deductibles, copays, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket cost sharing parameters. We calibrate d the utilization and unit cost assumptions by category of service in the model to the allowed cost estimates underlying the manual rate and/or experience rate, including adjustments for EHB, trend, provider reimbursement changes by service category , average expected demographics and other adjustments discussed elsewhere in this report. 8. RISK ADJUSTMENT AND REINSURANCE Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM We have developed manual rates for a 1.0 average statewide risk and assumed that MDwise would enroll average risk individuals. Therefore, no risk adjustment PMPM payment is as sumed in 201 5. Reinsurance The presence of the Federal reinsurance program will reduce costs for issuers in the individual market. This adjustment is intended to capture the portion of costs that will be reimbursed to health plans for reinsurance. The 2015 reinsurance program has an attachment point of $ 70,000 and a maximum coverage limit of $250,000 per member. HHS will reimburse health plans 50% of paid costs between the attachment point and maximum coverage limit. To estimate the impact of reinsur ance, we reviewed several claims probability distributions (CPDs) from different sources, adjusted to our estimated allowed PMPMs. To estimate the impact of moving from allowed to paid continuance, we increased the attachment and maximum values from the f ederal parameters by the MOOP for various plans, since the vast majority of individuals would have already reached their MOOP when costs reach the reinsurance attachment point. Our estimates are very sensitive to the shape of the CPD, the overall allowed cost PMPM that the CPD is calibrated to, as well as the MOOP and underlying Actuarial Value of the plan. Based on sensitivity testing, we have assumed that the average reinsurance impact will be a 7.9% reduction to net allowed claims costs. This adjustme nt was applied uniformly across all benefit plan packages. We have assumed that the allocated federal reinsurance dollars will be sufficient to fund the federal reinsurance program in 201 5, which is not guaranteed. 9. NON -BENEFIT EXPENSES AND PROFIT & RISK Administrative Expense Load MDwise developed expected administrative costs based on current administrative costs for their Medicaid line of business, adjusted to reflect any differences in functions or level of effort for the MDwise Individual Product PROJECTED LOSS RATIO 2015 Rate Filing Page 9 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. commercial product. MDwise a ssumed a 50% of administrative expenses would increase by 3% from 2014 on a PMPM basis while 50% would increase with premium rates. For the small service areas, the PMPM component was increased to spread fixed costs across a small member cohort. Contribut ion to Surplus & Risk Margin Three percent (3%) of premiums ha s been allocated to contribution to surplus. Taxes and Fees Taxes and regulatory fees include the following: 1. PCORI Fee = $0. 25 PMPM 2. Issuer Fee = It is not clear if MDwise will be exempt from the issuer fee in 2015 . We have assumed they will be subject to the fee in this filing. 3. Health Insurance Exchange Fee = 3.5% of premium for products sold through the Exchange. MDwise expects the vast majority of their business to be sold through the ex change and we have included the full 3.5% load in premium rate development . Please note that in the URRT taxes and fees section, the risk adjustment and reinsurance fees have been excluded. Reinsurance and Risk Adjustment Fees The following fees were nette d out of the experience in the URRT. 1. Reinsurance Charge = $ 3.67 PMPM 2. Risk Adjustment User Fee = $1.00 PMPY ($0.08 PMPM) 10. PROJECTED LOSS RATIO Wakely's estimates indicate projected MLRs for the individual line of business of 83.8% for 201 5. Consistent with the MLR and Risk Corridor calculations, regulatory fees and taxes were excluded from premium in the calculation of this value. 11. SINGLE RISK POOL MDwise has established a single risk pool for all of its individual business. Since MDwise did not participate in the individual market prior to 2014, all of its individual business is non -grandfathered, non -transitional, and ACA -compliant. MDwise Individual Product INDEX RATE 2015 Rate Filing Page 10 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. 12. INDEX RATE Index Rate for Projection Period The starting allowed claim index of $810.19 is developed from the historical claim index rate of the Indiana Small Group Market. Appendix C, Table C-2 illustrates this development. The bullet points below briefly describe specific line items in Table C-2. For comparative purposes, the adjustment for average perce ntage of smokers has been retained in the table. Per CCIIO instructions, the adjustment for the smoker load should not be included in the starting allowed claim cost, so to calculate the $810.19 the factor is excluded. Base Period Allowed PMPM - These historical claim index rates are developed from publicly available information . Cost Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for cost differences between the base period and projected period and include an adjustment for the embedded smoking load in the base p eriod and expected bad debt that is introduced by the grace period. Benefit Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for differences between the base period benefits and those offered under the exchange as essential health benefits. Morbidity Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for differences in the morbidity of the population underlying the base period allowed PMPM and the population expected in the exchange market. Included in this adjustment are considerations for morbidity and demographic differences, pent -up demand, and the impact of transitional policies . Trend factor - We used an assumed trend of 8.0% over 30 months to trend the base period data to a midpoint of 7/1/201 5. Allowed Claim Index Rate by Source - The allowed claim index rate is calculated as the product of the historical claim index rate and all the factors listed above in this section. Market Adjusted Index Rate We included the impact of reinsurance and risk adjustment and the exchange user fee to the index rate for the projection period to develop the market adjusted index rate. The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item g. Plan Adjusted Index Rate To bring the experience used in the manual rating to a \"non -tobacco\" basis, a downward adjustment is applied using a factor of 0.9875 . Among the items contemplated when setting this assumption were the rates of tobacco use in Indiana as well as the proportion of people who will self -report as \"Smokers.\" We multiplied the market adjusted rate by provider contracting di scounts, the actuarial value and the federal induced demand factors. We then included the admin, commissions, ACA fees, tax, and profit margin. The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item v. MDwise Individual Product AV METAL LEVELS 2015 Rate Filing Page 11 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. Calibration To bring the experience to age 21 rate, we divided the plan adjusted index rate by the weighted average age factor. The age factor was calculate d as the weighted average of ACA age factors and the 201 5 expected individual enrollment by age. The average age is approximately 50 years . The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item w. Consumer Adjusted Index Rate The consumer adjusted index rates are calculated by multiplying the calibrated plan adjusted index rates by the consumer's specific age factor , area, and toba cco status. As last year's restrictions on the smoker load (limiting smoker loaded rates to the same 3:1 limit as non -smoker rates) have been removed, the loads have been change and are shown in Appendix D. Using the age factors and smoking load Area Fact ors in Appendix D, one can take the index rate from Appendix A and develop the rates for each product and age combination. Two example s are provided in Appendix E. 13. AV METAL LEVELS The Federal AVC was used without modification to generate the AV metal tier (column b on Appendix A) . The Federal AVC s were as follows: Bronze A 61.8% Silver A (base) 71.9% CSR) 93.0% 14. AV PRICING VALUES The reference plan underlying our pricing was a Silver plan. From this base PMPM , we applied benefit richness utilization adjustments to stratify this PMPM to levels suitable for e ach of the metal tiers. We used the following values which are equal to the Federal values published in the Federal Register payment notice, normalized to the silver benefit level: MDwise Individual Product MEMBERSHIP PROJECTIONS 2015 Rate Filing Page 12 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. Bronze = 1.00 / 1.03 = 0.9709 Silver = 1.03 / 1.03 = 1.000 0 Gold = 1.08 / 1.03 = 1.0485 MDwise is not offering Platinum or Catastrophic plan s. The adjustment factors above are shown in Appendix A, column o. The same underlying cost distribution and cost level was used. The only adjustment before determining AV pricing values wa s benefit richness utilization differences using Federal adjustment factors. Therefore, differences in expected morbidity across metal tiers were not included in the pricing development for each metal tier plan. These adjustments do not incorporate a sele ction bias due to health status. Rather, they represent an adjustment due to any particular individual utilizing services differently when they have a richer or less rich benefit design. The pricing AVs are higher than the Federal AVCs primarily because t he estimated allowed PMPMs are higher than those underlying the Federal AV calculator. This is due to a leveraging effect for fixed cost sharing elements like copays, deductibles and MOOPs. This effect is more pronounced in 2015 than it was in 2014 because of the morbidity increases assumed due to the addition of the high risk population (conversion from 209(b) to 1634) and the higher age distribution. 15. MEMBERSHIP PROJECTIONS The membershi p projections for 201 5 were developed by Wakely in consultation with MDwise based on emergin g enrollment and expected new enrollment for 2015 . Appendix B shows estimates of the Cost Sharing Reduction by Silver base and Silver variant level. We used the Federal formula shown in the Advance Payment Notice, which is equal to the difference in AVC multiplied by the allowed cost PMPM for each base plan, increased by 1.12 for cost sharing utilization for the 87% and 94% variants. 16.

ACTUARIAL CERTIFICATION I, Ross Winkelman , am a Fellow in the Society of Actuaries (FSA) and a m ember of the American Academy of Actuaries (MAAA) . I meet the Qualification Standards of Actuarial Opinion as adopted by the American Academy of Actuaries. The submission is in comp liance with all applicable laws, regulations , and guidance of the Federal government and the state of Indiana as of May 10 , 201 4. The submission is in compliance with the appropriate Actuarial Standards of Practice (ASOP's) including: ASOP No. 5, Incurred Health and Disability Claims ASOP No. 8, Regulatory Filings for Health Pl an Entities ASOP No. 12, Risk Classification MDwise Individual Product ACTUARIAL CERTIFICATION 2015 Rate Filing Page 14 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. ASOP No. 23, Data Quality ASOP No. 25, Credibility Procedures Applicable to Accident and Health, Group Term Life, and Property/Casualty Coverages ASOP No. 41, Actuarial Communication In my opinion, t he premiums are reasonable in relation to the benefits provided and the population anticipated to be covered . Further, the premiums are not excessive nor deficient although actual experience may vary from the estimates inherent in the premium rate development. The in dex rate and only the allowable modifiers as described in 45 CFR 156.80(d)(1) and 45 CFR 156.80(d)(2) were used to generate plan level rates. The percent of total premium that represents essential health benefits included in Worksheet 2, Sections III and I V were calculated in accordance with ASOPs. The Federal AV Calculator was used to determine the AV Metal Values shown in Worksheet 2 of the Unified Rate Review Template for all plans. The Part I Unified Rate Review Template does not demonstrate the process used to develop the rates. Rather it represents information required by Federal regulation to be provided in support of the review of rate increases, for certification of qualified health plans for Federally facilitated exchanges and for certification tha t the index rate is developed in accordance with Federal regulation and used consistently and only adjusted by the allowable modifiers .

This Coordination of Benefit (\"COB\") section applies when an Enrollee has Coverage for Health Services under more than one \"Plan,\" as defined below. The Order of Benefit Rules in Section 11.3 determines whether the benefits of this Contract are determined before or after those of another Plan. If the Order of Benefit Rules determines that this Contract is the \"Primary Plan,\" as defined below, then the benefits of this Contract will not be reduced. If the Order of Benefit R ules determines that this Contract is the \"Secondary Plan,\" as defined below, then the benefits of this Contract may be reduced. Section 11.2 Definitions. The following definitions apply throughout this Article 11 , but do not apply to the rest of the Con tract: (A) \"Allowable Expense \" means a necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi -private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the re asonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the plan provisions, the amount of the reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred provider arrangements. (B) \"Claim Determination Period \" means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract , or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. (C) \"Plan \" means this Contract and any of the following arrangements that provide benefits or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (1) Employer insurance or Employer -type coverage, whether insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, Employer practice or individual pract ice coverage. It also includes coverage other than school accident -type coverage. (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or coverage required or provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (Title XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assi stance Programs, of the United States Social Security Act, as amended from time to time). (3) Each arrangement described in (1) or (2) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate plan. (D) \"Plan Year \" means, for the initial Plan Year, the twelve -month period commencing with the date that Employer's coverage under this Contract becomes effective. Thereafter, it means the twelve -month period commencing on the anniversary of E mployer's Coverage under this Contract . 56 62033-2015 -1 [MDwise Marketplace Individual/Child -Only Policy ] (E) \"Primary \" or \" Primary Plan \" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If this Contract is Primary to another Plan, this Contract 's benefits will be determined before those of the other Plan without conside ring the other Plan's benefits. (F) \"Secondary \" or \" Secondary Plan \" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If this Contract is Seco ndary to another Plan, this Contract 's benefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a result of benefits provided by the other Plan. Section 11.3 Order of Benefit Rules. General . If there is a basis for benefits under th is Contract and another Plan, this Contract is the Secondary Plan unless (1) the other Plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those of this Contract , and (2) the rules of this Contract and the other Plan require this Contract to be the Primary Plan. Specific Rules . The following rules will be applied in the order they appear to determine whether this Contract is Primary or Secondary to another Plan: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent . The Plan that covers the individual as an active employee or inactive employee (i.e., laid -off or retired) rather than as a dependent is the Primary Plan except in the following situation. The Plan that covers the individual as a dependent is Primary to the Plan that covers the individual as an employee if the individual is a lso a Medicare beneficiary, and, as a result of the rule established by Title XVIII of the Social Security Act and implementing regulations, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the individual as a dependent and Primary to the Plan covering the indiv idual as an employee. (2) Dependent Child or Parents not Separated or Divorced . If two Plans cover the same child as a dependent of his parents, the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a calendar year will be Primary. If both parents have th e same birthday, then the Plan that has covered one parent longer will be the Primary Plan. However, if the other Plan has a rule based on gender instead of this birthday rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, then the rul e in the other Plan will determine the order of benefits. (3) Dependent Child or Separated or Divorced . If two or more Plans cover the same child as a dependent of divorced or separated parents the following rules apply unless a qualified medical child suppo rt order (\"QMCSO\"), as defined in ERISA, specifies otherwise: a. the Plan of the parent with custody of the Child is Primary; b. the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child is the next Plan to be Primary; and c. the Plan of the parent without c ustody of the child is the last Plan to be Primary. If a QMCSO states that a parent is responsible for the health care expense of a child, that parent's Plan is Primary as long as the administrator of the Plan has actual knowledge of the QMCSO. The plan o f the other parent is the Secondary Plan. Until the plan administrator has actual knowledge of the QMCSO, then the rules stated in (a), (b), and (c) above apply for any Claim Determination Period or Plan Year during which benefits are paid or provided. (4) Joint Custody . If a court order states that a child's parents have joint custody of the child but does not specify that one parent is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the order of benefit rules in Paragraph (2), Dependent Child or Pare nts not Separated or Divorced will apply. (5) Active or Inactive Employee . A Plan that covers an individual as an active employee is Primary to a Plan that covers the individual as an inactive employee (i.e., laid -off or retired). This rule will be ignored if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits. (6) Dependent of Active or Inactive Employee . A Plan that covers an individual as a dependent of an active employee is Primary to a Plan that covers an individual as a dependent of an inactive employee (i.e., laid -57 62033-2015 -1 [MDwise Marketplace Individual/Child -Only Policy ] off or retired). This rule will be ignored if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits. (7) Continuation Coverage . If an individ ual has Continuation Coverage under this Contract and also has coverage under another Plan as an employee or dependent, the other Plan is Primary to this Contract . This rule will be ignored if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the P lans do not agree on the order of benefits. (8) Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage . If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the Plan that has covered the individual longer will be Primary to the Plan that has covered th e individual for a shorter term. Section 11.4 Effect on the Benefits of this Contract . Section 11.4 applies when the Order of Benefit Rules in Section 11.3 determine that this Contract is Secondary to one or more other Plans. This Contract 's benefits will be reduced when the sum of (1) and (2) below exceeds the Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under this Contract in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that woul d be payable for the Allowable Expenses under the other Plans, in the absence of COB provisions like this Contract 's COB provisions, whether or not a claim is made. The benefits of this Contract will be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under t he other Plans do not exceed the Allowable Expenses. Each benefit will be proportionally reduced and then charged against any applicable benefit limit of this Contract . Section 11.5 Facility of Payment . If another Plan provides a benefit that should have been paid or provided under this Contract , We may reimburse the Plan for the benefit. We may then treat the amount as if it were a benefit provided under this Contract and will not be responsible for providing that benefit again. This provision applies to the payment of benefits as well as to providing services. If services are provided, then We will reimburse the other Plan for the reasonable cash value of those services. Section 11.6 Right of Recovery. If this Contract provides a benefit that exceeds the amount of benefit it should have provided under the terms of these COB provisions, We may seek to recover the excess of the amount paid or the reasonable cash value of services provided from the following . (1) The individuals We have paid or for whom We h ave provided the benefit; (2) Insurance Companies; or (3) Other Organizations. Article 1 2 GENERAL PROVISIONS Section 12.1 Entire Contract.

This Coordination of Benefit (\"COB\") section applies when an Enrollee has Coverage for Health Services under more than one \"Plan,\" as defined below. The Order of Benefit Rules in Section 11.3 determines whether the benefits of t his Contract are determined before or after those of another Plan. If the Order of Benefit Rules determines that this Contract is the \"Primary Plan,\" as defined below, then the benefits of this Contract will not be reduced. If the Order of Benefit Rules determines that this Contract is the \"Secondary Plan,\" as defined below, then the benefits of this Contract may be reduced. Section 11.2 Definitions. The following definitions apply throughout this Article 11 , but do not apply to the rest of the Contract : (A) \"Allowable Expense \" means a necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more Plans covering the individual for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semi -private hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasona ble cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan because a covered individual does not comply with the plan provisions, the amount of the reduction will not be considered an Allowable Expense. Examples of such provisions are those related to second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions or services, and preferred provider arrangements. (B) \"Claim Determination Period \" means a calendar year. Howe ver, it does not include any part of a year during which an individual does not have Coverage under this Contract , or any part of a year before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. (C) \"Plan \" means this Contract and any of the foll owing arrangements that provide benefits or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (1) Employer insurance or Employer -type coverage, whether insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, Employer practice or individual practice c overage. It also includes coverage other than school accident -type coverage. (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or coverage required or provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (Title XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistanc e Programs, of the United States Social Security Act, as amended from time to time). (3) Each arrangement described in (1) or (2) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a sepa rate plan. (D) \"Plan Year \" means, for the initial Plan Year, the twelve -month period commencing with the date that Employer's coverage under this Contract becomes effective. Thereafter, it means the twelve -month period commencing on the anniversary of Employ er's Coverage under this Contract . 58 62033 -2015 Marketplace Individual /Child -Only Policy ] (E) \"Primary \" or \" Primary Plan \" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual before another Plan that covers the same individual. If this Contract is Primary to another Plan, this Contract 's benefits will be determined before those of the other Plan without conside ring the other Plan's benefits. (F) \"Secondary \" or \" Secondary Plan \" means the Plan that provides benefits for an individual after another Plan that covers the same individual. If this Contract is Secondary to another Plan, this Contract 's benefits will be determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced as a result of benefits provided by the other Plan. Section 11.3 Order of Benefit Rules. General . If there is a basis for benefits under this Contract and another Plan, this Contract is the Secondary Plan unless (1) the other Plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those of this Contract , and (2) the rules of this Contract and the other Plan require this Contract to be the Primary Plan. Specific Rules . The following rules will be applied in the order they appear to determine whether this Contract is Primary or Secondary to another Plan: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent . The Plan that covers the individual as an active employee or inactive employ ee (i.e., laid -off or retired) rather than as a dependent is the Primary Plan except in the following situation. The Plan that covers the individual as a dependent is Primary to the Plan that covers the individual as an employee if the individual is also a Medicare beneficiary, and, as a result of the rule established by Title XVIII of the Social Security Act and implementing regulations, Medicare is Secondary to the Plan covering the individual as a dependent and Primary to the Plan covering the individua l as an employee. (2) Dependent Child or Parents not Separated or Divorced . If two Plans cover the same child as a dependent of his parents, the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a calendar year will be Primary. If both parents have the sa me birthday, then the Plan that has covered one parent longer will be the Primary Plan. However, if the other Plan has a rule based on gender instead of this birthday rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, then the rule in the other Plan will determine the order of benefits. (3) Dependent Child or Separated or Divorced . If two or more Plans cover the same child as a dependent of divorced or separated parents the following rules apply unless a qualified medical child support o rder (\"QMCSO\"), as defined in ERISA, specifies otherwise: a. the Plan of the parent with custody of the Child is Primary; b. the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child is the next Plan to be Primary; and c. the Plan of the parent without custo dy of the child is the last Plan to be Primary. If a QMCSO states that a parent is responsible for the health care expense of a child, that parent's Plan is Primary as long as the administrator of the Plan has actual knowledge of the QMCSO. The plan of the other parent is the Secondary Plan. Until the plan administrator has actual knowledge of the QMCSO, then the rules stated in (a), (b), and (c) above apply for any Claim Determination Period or Plan Year during which benefits are paid or provided. (4) Joint Custody . If a court order states that a child's parents have joint custody of the child but does not specify that one parent is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the order of benefit rules in Paragraph (2), Dependent Child or Parents not Separated or Divorced will apply. (5) Active or Inactive Employee . A Plan that covers an individual as an active employee is Primary to a Plan that covers the individual as an inactive employee (i.e., laid -off or retired). This rule will be ignored if t he other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits. 59 62033 -2015 -1 [MDwise Marketplace Individual /Child -Only Policy ] (6) Dependent of Active or Inactive Employee . A Plan that covers an individual as a dependent of an active employee is Primary to a Plan that covers an i ndividual as a dependent of an inactive employee (i.e., laid - off or retired). This rule will be ignored if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits. (7) Continuation Coverage . If an individual has Continuation Coverage under this Contract and also has coverage under another Plan as an employee or dependent, the other Plan is Primary to this Contract . This rule will be ignored if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits. (8) Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage . If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the Plan that has covered the individual longer will be Primary to the Plan that has covered the individual for a shorter term. Section 11.4 Effect on the Benefits of this Contract . Section 11.4 applies when the Order of Benefit Rules in Section 11.3 determine that this Contract is Secondary to one or more other Plans. This Contract 's benefits will be reduced when the sum of (1) and (2) below exceeds the Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period: (1) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under this Contract in the absence of this COB provision; and (2) The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under the other Plans, in the absence of COB provisions like this Contract 's COB provisions, whether or not a claim is made. The benefits of this Contract will be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under the o ther Plans do not exceed the Allowable Expenses. Each benefit will be proportionally reduced and then charged against any applicable benefit limit of this Contract . Section 11.5 Facility of Payment . If another Plan provides a benefit that should have bee n paid or provided under this Contract , We may reimburse the Plan for the benefit. We may then treat the amount as if it were a benefit provided under this Contract and will not be responsible for providing that benefit again. This provision applies to the payment of benefits as well as to providing services. If services are provided, then We will reimburse the other Plan for the reasonable cash value of those services. Section 11.6 Right of Recovery. If this Contract provides a benefit that exceeds the amount of benefit it should have provided under the terms of these COB provisions, We may seek to recover the excess of the amount paid or the reasonable cash value of services provided from the following . (1) The individuals We have paid or for whom We have provided the benefit; (2) Insurance Companies; or (3) Other Organizations. Article 1 2 GENERAL PROVISIONS Section 12.1 Entire Contract.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This memorandum documents the development of individual rates for MDwise. These rates will be offered inside of the State of Indiana's health insurance exchange, which is being operated by the federal government. MDwise is a not -for-profit corporation that purchased 100% of the stock in IU Health Plan, Inc., a fully licensed HMO, (IUHP) on December 29, 2006. IUHP was merged into MDwise, Inc. as of January 1, 2007. MDwise remains a fully licensed Indiana domestic HMO. MDwise is jointly controlled by Indiana University Health, Inc. and Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County Indiana. The two parent companies are not-for-profit, are incorporated in the State of Indiana, and are provider deliv ery system companies. Beginning January 1, 2011, MDwise was granted a four -year contract with the State of Indiana (the \"State\"), through the Family and Social Service Administration (\"FSSA\") and Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (\"OMPP\"), to arrange for and administer two risk -based managed care programs (\"Hoosier Healthwise\" and \"Healthy Indiana Plan\") for certain Indiana Medicaid enrollees. MDwise contracts with various delivery networks. The delivery networks accept the medical service risk for enr ollees who choose a primary care provider after selecting the MDwise network. There were approximately 280,000 members enrolled in the Hoosier Healthwise and Healthy Indiana Plan products at December 31, 2013. Under an Accountable Care Organization model, MDwise contracts with several integrated delivery systems to provide medical services and claims administration under risk contracts for their current business. MDwise has operated under this model since its inception. MDwise is offering two individual he alth insurance products in the Bronze and Silver metal tiers and one individual health insurance product in the Gold metal tier. Being a non -profit health plan focused on low income individuals, MDwise expects most enrollment to be in the Silver plan, for individuals eligible for premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions. MDwise's mission is to provide health care services to the lower income population. One of the primary reasons that MDwise is entering the individual market within the health insur ance exchange is to provide its Medicaid members with a n MDwise product offering if they lose Medicaid eligibility. MDwise has applied for a new HMO license in the State of Indiana (MDwise Marketplace). Our filing is in the review process. MDwise anticipates it to be active in time for 2015 Open Enrollment season. MD wise has applied and received a new HIOS ID number of 62033.

GENERAL INFORMATION Company Legal Name : MDwise Marketplace , Inc.

PROPOSED RATE INCREASES MDwise began selling individual policies with effective dates beginning January 20 14. They did not previously participate in the individual market. The effective rate increase is 35% for 2015 for all proposed individual policies. This large increase is driven primarily by Indiana's transition from a 209(b) state to a 1634 state and the associated population expected to enroll in the individual market because of this change . 4. EXPERIENCE PERIOD PREMIUM AND CLAIMS , BENEFIT CATEGORIES AND PROJECTION FACTORS MDwise began selling individual policies with effective dates beginning January 2014. The effective rate increase for 2015 is 35% for all proposed individual policies. Because they did not participate in the individual or small group markets prior to 2014 and 2014 experienc e is not yet credible , the rate development is based entirely on a manual rate. MDwise Individual Product MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT 2015 Rate Filing Page 4 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. 5. MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT The basic manual rate development methodology is unchanged from the 2014 premium rate development. Updated market experience was not available at a sufficient level of detail to justify redevelop ing the manual rate . Instead, we reflected emerging demographic and risk adjustment information in our mo rbidity assumptions and updated other assumptions that were different from 2014 including trend, the impact of reinsurance, benefit changes, leveraging of fixed cost sharing items and the addition of individuals expected to enroll in the Individual market starting in 2014 because of Indiana's transition from a 209(b) state to a 1634 state . The approach to premium rate development is as follows: 1. Paid and/or allowed PMPM medical costs were developed using market information including competitor rate filings, premium rates, and financial filings. If historic experience net of member cost sharing was used, paid to allowed ratios were estimated using the Wakely pricing model. Table C -1 in Appendix C shows the various sources used for the small group source deve lopment . 2. Allowed PMPMs were adjusted for trend and ACA changes and requirements including EHB, pent up demand, morbidity changes between pre and post ACA enrollment and others described below. 3. The Wakely pricing model was calibrated to the adjusted allowed PMPMs and used to estimate paid to allowed ratios. Within a benefit plan offering, a consumer may choose to use providers in a preferred network of providers and receive reduced cost sharing, represented by Tier 1. If a consumer chooses instead to use n on-preferred providers, the cost sharing is greater, represented by Tier 2. They have been blended with a 90% weighting on Tier 1 and 10% on Tier 2, reflective of MDwise's expectations on actual utilization. The pricing by tier and blended result is show n in Appendix A. 4. Administrative costs and regulatory fees and taxes, along with contribution to surplus were added. Appendix C, Table C -2 shows the components of the starting allowed PMPM shown in Appendix A. A comparison to the 2014 development is also provided. Source and Appropriateness of Experience Data Used The allowed PMPM target for post reform experience was developed usi ng pre-reform small group market information. Even though the goal is to price individual products post reform, the post reform individual market may look more like the pre -reform small group market than the pre -reform individual market. Therefore, we reviewed rate filings and financial reports for Indiana small group products . We made adjustments for trend, benefit design, and others to adjust the allowed PMPM to the midpoint of the rating period. MDwise Individual Product MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT 2015 Rate Filing Page 5 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. Population Changes The manual rate incorporates results from the SOA study1 (performed by Optum/Lewin) to estimate changes in morbidity from the Indiana pre-ACA market to that enrolled in Indiana post ACA. Results from other states and analyses, including those performed by Wakely were also reviewed , but the Lewin model framework was used . Wakely has performed detailed studies on behalf of individual sta tes with broad health plan participation and detailed data collection. We have found some of the values provided by the health plans, high risk pool, and the state differ (sometimes significantly) from the values presented in the SOA study, which is reaso nable given the different data sources used and differences in judgment likely between actuaries performing this type of modeling. We made adjustments and applied judgment with input from the health plan in developing the final estimates of how the post r eform market would co mpare to the pre -reform market. The primary changes were to decrease the number of previously uninsured entering the market and to increase their assumed health status since the SOA values are targeted once the ACA has been fully impl emented. Wakely also reviewed emerging results from the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Reporting study. This study included participation from Indiana issuers , including MDwise . The issuers reported claims and demographic based risk adjustment informa tion through February 2014. The project will include updated information throughout 2014 which we will be reviewing as it becomes available. Emerging Indiana information caused us to increase our morbidity assumption by 3%. This is primarily driven by a higher age distribution than originally anticipated. This adjustment captures expected morbidity over and above allowable rating variation. The components of the Morbidity Adjustment are shown in Appendix C, Table C-2. Appendix F provides the detai l behind the base SOA tables and our adjustments to the SOA tables to develop the final morbidity adjustment factor in Appendix C (1.0 339). Pent up demand and the 2014 strategic renewal impact adjustments are described in more detail below. Cost Adjustme nts We have made two adjustments to account for cost variances. Smoking Load - We adjusted the base period data by a factor of 0.9874 to create an index rate that is reflective of a non -smoking population. Bad Debt - To account for the likelihood that some policy holders will not pay premiums within the grace period, we have increased rates by a factor of 1.00275. This is calculated assuming a 15% rate of non -payment of one out of twelve months on about 22% of premium, after consider ing federal subsidies (.15 x .224 x 1/12 = .00275). 1 Web link (as of 4 -4-2013): http://www.soa.org/NewlyInsured/ MDwise Individual Product MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT 2015 Rate Filing Page 6 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. Trend Factors (cost / utilization) We assumed PMPM medical costs would increase by 8% annually from 2012 to 2015 due to ongoing increases in utilization, unit costs and technology. This assumption is based on review of rate fi lings for Indiana and other states, national publicly available trend surveys, and judgment. These trends do not include the effect of demographics or benefits because those adjustments are included elsewhere. Essential Health Benefits (EHB) We adjusted th e allowed claims sources in the manual rate development for expected changes in covered benefits due to EHB requirements , specific to individual and small group market starting cost sources . The following is not an all -inclusive list but it highlights the benefits expected to have the most significant impact s on allowed costs: Maternity and prescription drug coverage. State mandated benefits included in the EHB that previously only applied to group coverage. Mental health and substance abuse parity. Each health plan will need to understand what benefit changes, if any, are needed to bring their current benefits up to parity, especially if the selected EHB is not at parity. Habilitative services, if not defined by the state, need to be defined by the plan. The impact on claims can vary significantly depending on the definition of the benefit. Pediatric vision and dental must be offered under EHB although pediatric dental may be excluded if a stand -alone dental plan is offered on the Exchange. Each plan must determine the resulting c osts of pediatric coverage. Adjustments for changing demographics, changes in benefits, and others were separately addressed and included in the premium rate development. To incorporate these adj ustments w e increased the small group market source by 2%. Provider Reimbursement Adjustment MDwise provided Wakely with provider contracting targets by plan (based on service area) for inpatient facility, outpatient facility and professional categories o f service . Wakely analyzed these targets and compared them to market info rmation regarding current commercial reimbursement rates. We assumed provider volume by provider system would be consistent with current MDwise Medicaid volume by provider system. The total adjustments to allowed cost varied by plan and are reflected in the geographic factors . Strategic Renewal Impact Many health plans were working to provide communication and incentive for individual policyholders to renew on 12/1/2013, 1/1/2014, o r at their scheduled renewal. This type of strategic approach has been used in the past as states have implemented different state based reforms. This approach likely increase d the average morbidity of individual s included in the risk adjustment pool in 2014. The healthy individuals MDwise Individual Product CREDIBILITY OF EXPERIENCE 2015 Rate Filing Page 7 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. will get a smaller rate increase under pre -ACA policies due to rating for health status while the sicker individuals would get a better rate on ACA policies since they do not rate for health status. For 2015, the impact of str ategic renewal would have disappeared but the administration allowed states to continue renewing these policies on pre -ACA products and Indiana has allowed such policies (referred to as a transitional or \"grandmothering\"). We have included a 10% adjus tment (1.10 factor) within our manual rate development for this (part of morbidity adjustment in Appendix C, Table C-2). Pent Up Demand In 2014, t here were many new enrollees in the individual market that were previously uninsured. Prior to enrolling in coverage, these people would have been paying out of pocket for any medical costs, and it can be assumed that they did not treat minor health problems or receive preventive care due to cost. Once they are covered in the Exchange , there may be an increase in utilization for this population as they will be more likely to afford to have minor issues treated and utilize preventive services . We expect very little rem aining pent up demand in 2015 . Therefore, we have removed the pent up demand effect and used a factor of 1.0 in Appendix C, Table C-2. Inclusion of Capitation Payments While MDwise will pay the Delivery Systems a global cap rate (percentage of premi um), the State of Indiana has required MDwise to report the underlying provider payments as the true medical costs to provide coverage in MDwise's financial statements . This is because the Delivery Systems are delegated a portion of the administrative cos ts associated with their members. Therefore, the capitation paid to the delivery systems is meant to cover direct medical costs, and provider overhead . Based on discussions between MDwise, CCIIO and the state of Indiana, we understand that this treatment will continue in 2014 and beyond. This is important because of the risk corridor protection and minimum loss ratio treatment, which affect the relative level of risk inherent in the premium rate development and overall delivery system payment amounts. 6. CRE DIBILITY OF EXPERIENCE MDwise began operating in the individual market in 2014 and that experience is not yet credible . As a result , the \"Experience Period\" section of Worksheet 1 of the URRT has not been populated. Similarly, the projection factors (cel ls J24:M29 on Worksheet 1) ha ve also been left blank. The service category PMPMs shown in the \"Credibility Manual\" section of Worksheet 1 were developed based on the approach described above and assigned 100% credibility . MDwise Individual Product PAID TO ALLOWED RATIO 2015 Rate Filing Page 8 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. 7. PAID TO ALLOWED RATIO The Wakel y pricing model uses a nationally -representative detailed medical and pharmacy claim and enrollment data (Truven MarketScan) for over 40 million lives to develop paid to allowed pricing estimates for final rate development (as opposed to metal tier categorization). The model uses actuarially sound pricing methods to value the impact of deductibles, copays, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket cost sharing parameters. We calibrate d the utilization and unit cost assumptions by category of service in the model to the allowed cost estimates underlying the manual rate and/or experience rate, including adjustments for EHB, trend, provider reimbursement changes by service category , average expected demographics and other adjustments discussed elsewhere in this report. 8. RISK ADJUSTMENT AND REINSURANCE Projected Risk Adjustments PMPM We have developed manual rates for a 1.0 average statewide risk and assumed that MDwise would enroll average risk individuals. Therefore, no risk adjustment PMPM payment is as sumed in 201 5. Reinsurance The presence of the Federal reinsurance program will reduce costs for issuers in the individual market. This adjustment is intended to capture the portion of costs that will be reimbursed to health plans for reinsurance. The 2015 reinsurance program has an attachment point of $ 70,000 and a maximum coverage limit of $250,000 per member. HHS will reimburse health plans 50% of paid costs between the attachment point and maximum coverage limit. To estimate the impact of reinsur ance, we reviewed several claims probability distributions (CPDs) from different sources, adjusted to our estimated allowed PMPMs. To estimate the impact of moving from allowed to paid continuance, we increased the attachment and maximum values from the f ederal parameters by the MOOP for various plans, since the vast majority of individuals would have already reached their MOOP when costs reach the reinsurance attachment point. Our estimates are very sensitive to the shape of the CPD, the overall allowed cost PMPM that the CPD is calibrated to, as well as the MOOP and underlying Actuarial Value of the plan. Based on sensitivity testing, we have assumed that the average reinsurance impact will be a 7.9% reduction to net allowed claims costs. This adjustme nt was applied uniformly across all benefit plan packages. We have assumed that the allocated federal reinsurance dollars will be sufficient to fund the federal reinsurance program in 201 5, which is not guaranteed. 9. NON -BENEFIT EXPENSES AND PROFIT & RISK Administrative Expense Load MDwise developed expected administrative costs based on current administrative costs for their Medicaid line of business, adjusted to reflect any differences in functions or level of effort for the MDwise Individual Product PROJECTED LOSS RATIO 2015 Rate Filing Page 9 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. commercial product. MDwise a ssumed a 50% of administrative expenses would increase by 3% from 2014 on a PMPM basis while 50% would increase with premium rates. For the small service areas, the PMPM component was increased to spread fixed costs across a small member cohort. Contribut ion to Surplus & Risk Margin Three percent (3%) of premiums ha s been allocated to contribution to surplus. Taxes and Fees Taxes and regulatory fees include the following: 1. PCORI Fee = $0. 25 PMPM 2. Issuer Fee = It is not clear if MDwise will be exempt from the issuer fee in 2015 . We have assumed they will be subject to the fee in this filing. 3. Health Insurance Exchange Fee = 3.5% of premium for products sold through the Exchange. MDwise expects the vast majority of their business to be sold through the ex change and we have included the full 3.5% load in premium rate development . Please note that in the URRT taxes and fees section, the risk adjustment and reinsurance fees have been excluded. Reinsurance and Risk Adjustment Fees The following fees were nette d out of the experience in the URRT. 1. Reinsurance Charge = $ 3.67 PMPM 2. Risk Adjustment User Fee = $1.00 PMPY ($0.08 PMPM) 10. PROJECTED LOSS RATIO Wakely's estimates indicate projected MLRs for the individual line of business of 83.8% for 201 5. Consistent with the MLR and Risk Corridor calculations, regulatory fees and taxes were excluded from premium in the calculation of this value. 11. SINGLE RISK POOL MDwise has established a single risk pool for all of its individual business. Since MDwise did not participate in the individual market prior to 2014, all of its individual business is non -grandfathered, non -transitional, and ACA -compliant. MDwise Individual Product INDEX RATE 2015 Rate Filing Page 10 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. 12. INDEX RATE Index Rate for Projection Period The starting allowed claim index of $810.19 is developed from the historical claim index rate of the Indiana Small Group Market. Appendix C, Table C-2 illustrates this development. The bullet points below briefly describe specific line items in Table C-2. For comparative purposes, the adjustment for average perce ntage of smokers has been retained in the table. Per CCIIO instructions, the adjustment for the smoker load should not be included in the starting allowed claim cost, so to calculate the $810.19 the factor is excluded. Base Period Allowed PMPM - These historical claim index rates are developed from publicly available information . Cost Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for cost differences between the base period and projected period and include an adjustment for the embedded smoking load in the base p eriod and expected bad debt that is introduced by the grace period. Benefit Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for differences between the base period benefits and those offered under the exchange as essential health benefits. Morbidity Adjustment - This adjustment accounts for differences in the morbidity of the population underlying the base period allowed PMPM and the population expected in the exchange market. Included in this adjustment are considerations for morbidity and demographic differences, pent -up demand, and the impact of transitional policies . Trend factor - We used an assumed trend of 8.0% over 30 months to trend the base period data to a midpoint of 7/1/201 5. Allowed Claim Index Rate by Source - The allowed claim index rate is calculated as the product of the historical claim index rate and all the factors listed above in this section. Market Adjusted Index Rate We included the impact of reinsurance and risk adjustment and the exchange user fee to the index rate for the projection period to develop the market adjusted index rate. The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item g. Plan Adjusted Index Rate To bring the experience used in the manual rating to a \"non -tobacco\" basis, a downward adjustment is applied using a factor of 0.9875 . Among the items contemplated when setting this assumption were the rates of tobacco use in Indiana as well as the proportion of people who will self -report as \"Smokers.\" We multiplied the market adjusted rate by provider contracting di scounts, the actuarial value and the federal induced demand factors. We then included the admin, commissions, ACA fees, tax, and profit margin. The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item v. MDwise Individual Product AV METAL LEVELS 2015 Rate Filing Page 11 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. Calibration To bring the experience to age 21 rate, we divided the plan adjusted index rate by the weighted average age factor. The age factor was calculate d as the weighted average of ACA age factors and the 201 5 expected individual enrollment by age. The average age is approximately 50 years . The development of this index rate can be seen in Appendix A, item w. Consumer Adjusted Index Rate The consumer adjusted index rates are calculated by multiplying the calibrated plan adjusted index rates by the consumer's specific age factor , area, and toba cco status. As last year's restrictions on the smoker load (limiting smoker loaded rates to the same 3:1 limit as non -smoker rates) have been removed, the loads have been change and are shown in Appendix D. Using the age factors and smoking load Area Fact ors in Appendix D, one can take the index rate from Appendix A and develop the rates for each product and age combination. Two example s are provided in Appendix E. 13. AV METAL LEVELS The Federal AVC was used without modification to generate the AV metal tier (column b on Appendix A) . The Federal AVC s were as follows: Bronze A 61.8% Silver A (base) 71.9% CSR) 93.0% 14. AV PRICING VALUES The reference plan underlying our pricing was a Silver plan. From this base PMPM , we applied benefit richness utilization adjustments to stratify this PMPM to levels suitable for e ach of the metal tiers. We used the following values which are equal to the Federal values published in the Federal Register payment notice, normalized to the silver benefit level: MDwise Individual Product MEMBERSHIP PROJECTIONS 2015 Rate Filing Page 12 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. Bronze = 1.00 / 1.03 = 0.9709 Silver = 1.03 / 1.03 = 1.000 0 Gold = 1.08 / 1.03 = 1.0485 MDwise is not offering Platinum or Catastrophic plan s. The adjustment factors above are shown in Appendix A, column o. The same underlying cost distribution and cost level was used. The only adjustment before determining AV pricing values wa s benefit richness utilization differences using Federal adjustment factors. Therefore, differences in expected morbidity across metal tiers were not included in the pricing development for each metal tier plan. These adjustments do not incorporate a sele ction bias due to health status. Rather, they represent an adjustment due to any particular individual utilizing services differently when they have a richer or less rich benefit design. The pricing AVs are higher than the Federal AVCs primarily because t he estimated allowed PMPMs are higher than those underlying the Federal AV calculator. This is due to a leveraging effect for fixed cost sharing elements like copays, deductibles and MOOPs. This effect is more pronounced in 2015 than it was in 2014 because of the morbidity increases assumed due to the addition of the high risk population (conversion from 209(b) to 1634) and the higher age distribution. 15. MEMBERSHIP PROJECTIONS The membershi p projections for 201 5 were developed by Wakely in consultation with MDwise based on emergin g enrollment and expected new enrollment for 2015 . Appendix B shows estimates of the Cost Sharing Reduction by Silver base and Silver variant level. We used the Federal formula shown in the Advance Payment Notice, which is equal to the difference in AVC multiplied by the allowed cost PMPM for each base plan, increased by 1.12 for cost sharing utilization for the 87% and 94% variants. 16.

RELIANCE Wakely Consulting Group, Inc., 9 777 Pyramid Ct, Suite 260, Englewood, CO 80112 relied on information provided by MDwise to develop the 2014 individual premium rates. Th is information includes , but is not limited to the following : Provider contracting levels , including descriptions of the relationship between the Delivery systems and MDwise Administrative cost projections Projected enrollment figures by QHP Product design information Provider network info rmation including discount data CCIIO and the State of I ndiana r egulatory and compliance interpretations and rulings Commercial rate filings and financial reports of carriers participating in the pre -ACA market. 20. ACTUARIAL CERTIFICATION I, Ross Winkelman , am a Fellow in the Society of Actuaries (FSA) and a m ember of the American Academy of Actuaries (MAAA) . I meet the Qualification Standards of Actuarial Opinion as adopted by the American Academy of Actuaries. The submission is in comp liance with all applicable laws, regulations , and guidance of the Federal government and the state of Indiana as of May 10 , 201 4. The submission is in compliance with the appropriate Actuarial Standards of Practice (ASOP's) including: ASOP No. 5, Incurred Health and Disability Claims ASOP No. 8, Regulatory Filings for Health Pl an Entities ASOP No. 12, Risk Classification MDwise Individual Product ACTUARIAL CERTIFICATION 2015 Rate Filing Page 14 \u00a9 201 4 Wakely, All Rights Reserved, Confidential and Proprietar y. ASOP No. 23, Data Quality ASOP No. 25, Credibility Procedures Applicable to Accident and Health, Group Term Life, and Property/Casualty Coverages ASOP No. 41, Actuarial Communication In my opinion, t he premiums are reasonable in relation to the benefits provided and the population anticipated to be covered . Further, the premiums are not excessive nor deficient although actual experience may vary from the estimates inherent in the premium rate development. The in dex rate and only the allowable modifiers as described in 45 CFR 156.80(d)(1) and 45 CFR 156.80(d)(2) were used to generate plan level rates. The percent of total premium that represents essential health benefits included in Worksheet 2, Sections III and I V were calculated in accordance with ASOPs. The Federal AV Calculator was used to determine the AV Metal Values shown in Worksheet 2 of the Unified Rate Review Template for all plans. The Part I Unified Rate Review Template does not demonstrate the process used to develop the rates. Rather it represents information required by Federal regulation to be provided in support of the review of rate increases, for certification of qualified health plans for Federally facilitated exchanges and for certification tha t the index rate is developed in accordance with Federal regulation and used consistently and only adjusted by the allowable modifiers .
