The networks provide a high and reliable standard of service, but running them is a technically complex and costly undertaking,amounting to some \u00a320 billion a year. In these networks, there is less scope forthe competition that has been introduced into many other parts of the utilityindustries. Successive Governments have therefore established and maintaineda system of economic regulation to protect consumer interests. The Office ofWater Services (OFWAT), the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM)and the Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL) are responsible, respectively, forwater and sewerage services, energy and telecommunications. In the absenceof effective competition for the provision of network services, each of theseregulators has introduced price controls using an output-based price-cappingapproach known as RPI - X, which prevents regulated companies from raisingprices by more than general price inflation less a given percentage factor (X) 1.

Throughout this report, we refer to RPI - X as a general term to describe the incentive-based regulation schemes used by regulators, including by OFWAT.2executive summaryPIPES AND WIRES 2 This report examines why regulators have developed the RPI - X approach (Part 1), considers how the work of regulators has benefited consumers (Part 2)and how regulators have sought to address the risks arising from the approach(Part 3) 2. The report focuses on price reviews for the water and electricity industries in England and Wales and telecommunications in the whole of theUnited Kingdom and we have sought to draw lessons of wider relevance toeconomic regulation 3. Main findings: the successes and potential limitations of the RPI - X process 3 In the absence of effective competition, regulation may be needed to protect consumers. The main challenge facing regulators is to create incentives formonopoly companies to deliver effective and efficient networks, but withoutcreating distorted or unintended incentives, or imposing excessive burdens onregulated companies. There is evidence that the way that regulators have usedRPI - X has been successful in achieving these objectives. Our analysis showsthat customers have seen lower prices and higher quality of service, andregulated companies have been able to cut costs and invest in their networks,while continuing to finance their functions. While the form of RPI - X has beensuccessful to date, limitations inherent in the approach mean that there are risksto the continued achievement of the regulators' objectives. This reportconsiders these limitations alongside the actions that the regulators have takento mitigate the consequent risks. Figure 2 summarises our analysis. 2 Our methodology is set out in Appendix 1. 3 We have also drawn lessons from gas and railway infrastructure price reviews where appropriate. The report's conclusions focus on the inherent risks in the prevailing approach and may therefore be applicable to other regulatory contexts using a similar price-capping approach. These include thewater industry in Scotland, the electricity industry in Northern Ireland and Scotland and the postal and airport industries in the United Kingdom as a whole.Potential risks arising from limitations in the RPI - X approach2 A The strength of incentives Incentives to find efficiency savings may be weaker toward the end of price control periods B Investment in networks i) RPI - X may distort incentives relating to investmentii) The regulators may make decisions on the level of investment on the basis of inadequate information C Financing investment i) Regulators may allow insufficient or excessive returns to investors ii) Investors may perceive the regulatory regime to be uncertain D The process of RPI - X regulation The process of price regulation may impose excessive demands on companies Source: National Audit Office3executive summaryPIPES AND WIRES The objectives of the regulators 4 Without some form of regulatory intervention there is a risk that companies in a monopoly or strongly dominant market position would be able to set excessiveprices or to provide a lower quality of service. The duties of the regulators areset out in the specific Acts of Parliament relating to the privatisation orsubsequent regulation of the industries concerned. The wording and preciseordering of the duties varies but they all require the regulators to protect theinterests of consumers in respect of the availability, price and quality of serviceand to ensure that the regulated companies can finance their functions 4. Since privatisation the UK regulators have adopted a common output-based approach,RPI - X, to capping the prices that pipe and wire monopoly companies cancharge for delivering the service expected. RPI - X involves the regulator forminga judgement on the likely costs companies should incur to deliver expectedoutputs efficiently during the next five years (four in telecommunications) andsetting prices to cover these costs according to a formula linked to the retailprice index (RPI). The consequences of RPI - X: incentives for companies, benefits for consumers 5 The strength of the RPI - X approach is that if companies can deliver the services at a lower cost than anticipated by the regulator, they keep the consequentadditional profits until the regulator next reviews the price cap. These savingscan then be passed on to consumers through lower prices or improved servicesin subsequent periods. RPI - X therefore provides strong incentives to improveefficiency for the ultimate benefit of customers, and also provides clearinformation to regulators on how companies can increase their efficiency overtime. We found that these incentives for efficiency have been associated withsubstantial improvements in the efficiency of the network companies. In theperiods up to the most recent price reviews the efficiency gains were of theorder of 3 to 9 per cent a year. These gains followed similarly substantial gainsearlier in the 1990s 5. 6 The reductions in the costs of the networks have not resulted in any significant reductions in the quality of service delivered to consumers, and many measuresof quality have improved. Consumers have continued to receive these essentialservices, and published data has shown: !reductions in interruptions to electricity supply since 1990; !reductions in the number of water consumers subject to unplanned supplyinterruptions since 1990; and !the percentage of successfully completed telephone calls has beenmaintained at a very high level. 4 The specific wording differs from case to case. For example, in the case of the Rail Regulator, the duty in this regard is to \"act in which he considers will not render it unduly difficult...to finance anyactivities ...in relation to which the Regulator has functions.\" 5 National Audit Office, The Work of the Directors General of Telecommunications, Gas Supply, Water Services and Electricity Supply (HC645, 1995-96). This found that, in real terms, prices had fallen bybetween 10% and 44% for domestic electricity, gas and telecommunications customers, and bybetween 9% and 54% for business customers.4PIPES AND WIRESexecutive summary7 Of the regulators, OFWAT have paid the greatest attention to promoting quality of service by network companies, by requiring them to supply each yearindependently validated figures against a wide range of indicators whichOFWAT publish as a way of encouraging improvements in performance. Theseindicators have shown a generally rising trend. They have also used pricereviews explicitly to improve outputs, resulting in substantial improvements inenvironmental and drinking water standards and in the security of watersupplies (as shown for example by reductions in water leakage 6). OFGEM have during 2001 made proposals for linking prices with specified quality measuresin the electricity (and gas) distribution networks. 8 Regulators have sought to pass on efficiency gains to customers at their next review through lower prices or higher standards 7. As a result of the most recent price reviews, consumers have in all cases benefited, mostly through pricereductions, although OFWAT applied part of these gains to offset the costs ofimproving water quality. The impact on prices is set out in Figure 3 which shows that, at the most recent price reviews, regulators introduced price cutsfor customers of network companies ranging from 1.5 per cent per year in realterms (electricity transmission) to 13 per cent per year in real terms(telecommunications). In addition, regulators introduced immediate price cutsfor the water (an average of 12.3 per cent in real terms) and electricitydistribution (an average of 24 per cent in real terms) industries. Impact on prices of the regulators' most recent reviews3 Telecommunications: Following the 2001 review, BT's charges for some network services will fall by up to 13 per cent a year in real terms overthe period. Services in markets that are prospectively competitive cannotincrease by more than RPI + 0 per cent. Electricity Transmission: The last electricity transmission price review resulted in caps on revenue that represent the equivalent (with stablevolumes of electricity transmitted) of falls in transmission charges of 1.5 per cent each year in real terms. Electricity Distribution: The last review cut distribution charges on average by 24 per cent in 2000-01, with further annual reductions of 3 per cent ayear in real terms for each company.! Water and sewerage: In their 1999 review, OFWAT reduced average water company prices by 12.3 per cent in real terms 2000-01, and an averageoverall reduction of 2.1 per cent per year over the period 2000-2005. Source: National Audit Office 6 The report by the National Audit Office, Office of Water Services: Leakage and water efficiency (HC971, 1999-2000), found that there had been reductions in the amount of water leakage year onyear from 1995. 7 The form of price cap can vary. In some industries, they involve limits on the prices companies can charge customers, while in others they represent caps on the revenues that a regulated companymay earn.5executive summaryPIPES AND WIRES Risks to the strength of incentives Incentives to find efficiency savings may be weaker toward the end of price control periods 9 Under RPI - X, regulated companies have an incentive to achieve efficiency gains because they can keep the benefits (in terms of higher profits) for either afixed period of time or until the regulator next reviews prices and passesbenefits back to customers. This can mean that, as the next review of pricesapproaches, the length of time for which companies enjoy the benefits ofefficiency improvements diminishes. As a result, under RPI - X the incentives tofind efficiency savings may be weaker toward the end of price control periods.Regulators can respond to this potential weakening in two ways: they can makeroll-over provisions, or they can attempt to anticipate this effect when makingtheir assessment of the future level of efficiently incurred costs. Risks to investment in networks i) The regulators may make decisions on the level of investment on the basis of inadequate information 10 Asset management is an important expertise for the network companies. They use their knowledge of the capability and performance of their assets to ensurethat they continue to deliver the outputs - in terms of reliable provision ofelectricity, water and telecommunications - required. They can also use thisknowledge to deliver improvements in service. Regulators need to make ajudgement in their price reviews on an appropriate level of expenditure on theassets, both to maintain asset performance and to deliver enhancements inquality. While they can obtain historic information on how much maintenanceand renewal has cost, this does not tell them whether that investment wassufficient, and there are significant problems for both companies and regulatorswith obtaining information on future needs, as follows: !pipe and wire networks have an underlying resilience and it could takesome time for inadequate or inefficient expenditure on maintaining them tobe reflected in declining performance against output measures, such asnumbers of interruptions; !links between expenditure and the quality of network performance are hardto identify; and !in seeking to obtain information about appropriate levels ofinvestment, regulators may become too involved in the detail of companyinvestment plans.The regulators' response to risks to the strength of incentives4 !Regulators are increasingly allowing companies to keep the benefit of efficiencies for five years regardless of when the savings are realised, although only OFWAThave made such a 'roll-over' provision relating to all forms of expenditure. !OFTEL prefer to deal with this issue by having a glide path rather than a one-offadjustment for prices and by basing their cost forecast on average annual changesin costs, along with an assessment of the extent to which costs currently exceed abenchmark level.6executive summaryPIPES AND WIRES 11 There is no evidence that investment has been inadequate or that the networks have deteriorated. For example, investment in the networks has been high (over\u00a331 billion since privatisation in gas and electricity, over \u00a350 billion in water,and similar amounts in telecommunications) and all the regulators considerthat the RPI - X regime is capable of incentivising even higher levels ofinvestment. But some regulated companies consider that the most recentperiodic reviews provided for less investment than they considered necessaryto prevent existing assets deteriorating, and that there may be a need for moreresilient and flexible networks in future. There are also indications that the levelof investment may have to rise in future to deliver the outputs the public expect.For example, the Better Regulation Task Force has reported an expectation inthe electricity sector of an increasing need for investment 8, while the Environmental Audit Committee has raised concerns about the level ofinvestment in the water industry to manage and renew sewer and water mains 9. ii) RPI - X may distort incentives relating to investment 12 Price reviews enable the regulators to form a judgement about what it should cost network companies to deliver the outputs expected of them, but there is adegree of uncertainty about the relationship between cost inputs and theoutputs delivered by regulated companies. Furthermore companies may notalways be sure that regulators will accept that additional investment isnecessary. This perceived lack of certainty creates an unintended reason forcompanies to defer investment. To address these concerns, regulators havedeveloped a process, with varying degrees of formality, for logging upinvestments made by companies for consideration at the next price review. Inthe water industry, companies can also in some circumstances apply for aninterim determination of price limits. Our survey of companies shows that thisissue is a serious concern to them and that they believe that some longer-termcertainty was needed. In the case of OFGEM and OFWAT there is a furthercomplication arising from the differing treatment of capital and operatingexpenditure which may produce an unintended reason for companies tosubstitute capital for operating expenditure. 8 Better Regulation Task Force, Economic Regulators (July 2001), paragraph 6.2. The Government's response to this report was published in February 2002. 9 Environmental Audit Committee, Water Prices and the Environment - Seventh Report, 1999-00 (HC597, 1999-00), paragraph 208. 10 OFWAT, MD161: Maintaining Serviceability to Customers (12 April 2000); OFGEM, Enhancing Asset Risk Management Standards in Gas and Electricity Network (8 November 2001).The regulators' response to investment risks5 The regulators are taking a range of initiatives including: !improving the quality of information and the incentives for long term investment. For example, OFGEM's Information and Incentives Project is intended to linkelectricity distribution company prices to improved measures of serviceperformance, and OFWAT have collected similar information since 1990; !encouraging companies to adopt a risk management approach to their networkassets. For example, OFWAT's recent paper on Maintaining Serviceability andOFGEM's paper on asset risk management assessments propose frameworks forcompanies to assess more rigorously the investment needed to maintain their networks in a way that satisfies the regulators 10; and !focusing on the outputs required from the networks.7executive summaryPIPES AND WIRES Risks to financing investment i) Regulators may allow insufficient or excessive returns to investors 13 The statutory duties of regulators include a requirement to ensure that companies can finance their functions. In determining price limits forcompanies, they seek to meet this duty by allowing for a return on capital toreward investors. This allowance can be a large part of the costs estimated byregulators and hence of price limits. For example, the returns allowed in thewater and electricity transmission industries amount to around one third of thetotal price paid by customers. Estimating an excessive return entails customerspaying unnecessary costs, while estimating too low a return may discourageinvestors from providing funds to regulated companies, thus potentially makingit difficult for companies to meet their obligations. 14 The regulators recognise that there is inevitably an element of judgement in their approach. But as the regulators have to include a precise figure in theircalculations, there is always a significant risk arising from the possibility thatthe figure they estimate appears to observers to be either too high or too low.There have in particular been concerns expressed by some water companiesthat this risk has crystallised in the water industry, by allowing for too low areturn in the last review. But OFWAT's view is that all companies havecontinued to finance their functions, that their assumptions were broadlyconsistent with those of other regulators and that companies dissatisfied withtheir price limits can require the regulators' decisions to be referred to theCompetition Commission 11. And they point out that, since the review, some companies have successfully responded to the incentives within RPI - X toachieve more efficient financing costs by becoming predominantly debt ratherthan equity financed. OFWAT continue to monitor these developments toensure that changes to a company's financial structure do not transfer riskscurrently borne by the company's owners to consumers. ii) Investors may perceive the regulatory regime to be uncertain 15 It is inherent in the RPI - X approach that the certainty during the period after a review comes in exchange for the regulators having considerable discretion inhow they determine prices and outputs at the next review. Investors are awarethat changes made at reviews can substantially impact on profitability andhence their returns. This may create a perception of uncertainty in the minds ofinvestors and hence increase the returns investors demand to finance newinvestment. Despite this perception of uncertainty, however, there have beenfew major changes in the overall RPI - X approach during the most recent pricereviews. But companies in all industries told us that they had concerns aboutsome elements of the methodology to be adopted by regulators in future. Forinstance, there were concerns as to whether investment undertaken during theperiod would be allowed in future price caps or whether changes would bemade to the methodology for calculating allowed capital expenditure or returnson investment. 11 In the case of OFWAT's 1999 price review, two companies required the licence amendments introducing new price limits to be referred to the Competition Commission.8executive summaryPIPES AND WIRES Risks arising from the process of RPI - X regulation The process of price regulation may impose excessivedemands on companies 16 Even though the price review process produces substantial benefits for customers, it is not without costs for both regulators and companies. We haveestimated that, on the basis of costs recorded by the regulators themselves, andresponses to the survey we issued to regulated companies, the costs of the pricereviews we have examined in detail for regulators amount to some \u00a310 million(for four price reviews), and for each company a significant level of costs,which can in some instances exceed \u00a31 million. These costs should be setagainst the benefits of the review process described above. 17 The regulated companies told us that it was not clear to them how much of the information they supplied to regulators had in fact been used. For example, acommon concern across all regulated companies was that the detailedprojections of future expenditure they provided were largely ignored. Theregulators consider that they used all the information provided and had tospend considerable time verifying and confirming it, but that their conclusionhad been to treat the projections with scepticism. This example serves toillustrate the risk that the RPI - X process imposes a large information burdenon both regulators and companies. Regulators can reduce information burdensby collecting and verifying more information between reviews, for instance byusing regulatory accounts provided by companies, although this may requirechanges in the format for some of these accounts. The regulators' response to the risks to financing investment6 The regulators are responding by seeking to improve the transparency and replicability of their price review work through: !explaining more clearly to companies and investors the assumptions lying behindtheir calculations; !seeking to communicate to companies and investors the methodologies they intendto use in future reviews; and !considering, and in the case of OFWAT, committing to, the sharing of the financialmodels on which they base their calculations, so that companies and others canreplicate their calculations. The regulators' response to the risks arising from the process of RPI - X regulation7 The regulators are: !examining how to reduce the volume of information they request from companies; !seeking to consult widely on their proposed price control approaches to helpcompanies and others understand the purposes for which regulators requestinformation; !seeking to demonstrate how they use information they receive, through the use ofclearer audit trails; and !seeking to reduce the number of information requests and to rely to a greaterextent on annual information returns and to revise the format of regulatoryaccounts to make them more useful (although it is inevitable that the forward-looking price review process will require some new information, principallyprojections for future periods).Conclusions and recommendations 18 Through their regulation of network prices, OFGEM, OFTEL and OFWAT have been successful in ensuring that the networks are maintained and enhancedand in encouraging substantial improvements in efficiency which have beenpassed on to customers. The RPI - X approach does, however, have someinherent limitations (Figure 2). The regulators have already started to considerhow they will conduct the next round of price reviews, and the followingrecommendations are aimed at helping the regulators to develop their existingpractices so as to continue to mitigate the risks arising from these limitations. A. Risks to the strength of incentives: I The regulators should seek to remove features of their price reviews that give companies an incentive to bias their decision making or accounting to obtainmore favourable treatment. Under the standard model of RPI - X, the length of time for which companies can benefit from out-performance of the regulatoryassumptions about efficiency savings varies according to when the savings aremade, which may lead companies to time their achievement of efficienciesaccording to a regulatory timetable (and not according to commercial oreconomic considerations). Similarly the differing treatment by OFGEM andOFWAT of operating and capital expenditure creates a risk that companies biastheir planning, decision making or accounting to obtain a more favourableoutcome. It is undesirable that the price review mechanism should riskinfluencing company behaviour in these ways. OFWAT already allowcompanies to keep all efficiency savings for five years, while OFGEM haveallowed distribution companies to retain some types of efficiency saving in thisway. OFTEL do not consider that there has been sufficient evidence of thisweaker incentive to warrant such a change. OFGEM and OFWAT are alsoconsidering how to minimise the risks arising from different treatment ofoperating and capital expenditure. B. Risks to investment in networks: II The regulators should consider publicly identifying the improvements in outputs and outcomes that they are willing to allow companies to invest in.Companies are required to deliver outputs, such as the reliable delivery of waterand electricity to consumers, which are explicit or implicit in government policy,legislation and the companies' licences. The companies have discretion over theinputs used to meet these outputs. But in setting price caps which enableefficient companies to finance their obligations, the regulators cannot avoidmaking assumptions about the outputs which are expected and the costs ofdelivering those outputs. To enable companies to plan and initiate investmentprojects effectively, regulators should provide clear guidance on developmentsin networks to meet changing circumstances or deliver better performance andthe preferred balance between quality of service and price levels. Suchstatements should draw on the requirements of Government and otherregulators, dialogue with regulated companies, and the preferences of thepublic; and they should be produced sufficiently ahead of each price review tofacilitate coherent investment planning. All the regulators we examined haveaddressed this issue by setting out broad quality objectives, establishing clearmethodologies for their assessment of company investment plans, and in somecases developing incentives to reward quality improvement. The provision ofclear guidance and statements by regulators in this area could further enhancethe effectiveness of regulation. 9executive summary10PIPES AND WIRESexecutive summaryIII The regulators should encourage network companies to develop risk management models to assess the potential impact of deterioration in assetperformance on future levels of service. While regulators obtain some measures of asset condition to support their price reviews, these do not tell theregulator what assets companies ought to replace in order to deliver theperformance expected of them. The network companies are best placed tomake this assessment. Such an assessment is needed to obtain a view of theinvestment required to maintain asset condition, especially if companies are tobe able to justify the forward investment referred to in the previousrecommendation by reference to outputs and outcomes. The regulators shouldbe able to place some reliance on these models to reduce the amount of workneeded during price reviews and to place the responsibility for securing thelonger term condition of networks clearly with the companies themselves. C. Risks associated with financing investment: IV The cost of capital allowance should be set in a way that transparently and consistently reflects the returns investors expect from investing in thecompanies concerned, assuming that they are efficiently operated. Prices and the willingness of investors to finance investment are sensitive to regulatoryassumptions on cost of capital, which is an inherently unverifiable forecast, andthe assumptions underlying which vary from review to review. Together,the regulators intend to commission research into the cost of capital issuesacross the regulated industries. The regulators should take this opportunity todevelop further consistency, taking account of relevant differences betweenindustries, which reflects research into what returns investors actually expectand the impact that heavy demand for finance for new investment may have onthese returns. V The regulators should present clearly the assumptions and financial models underlying their price review decisions and the extent to which these willapply at the next review. The potentially costly perception of uncertainty in the price review process is aggravated if companies and investors do notunderstand precisely why regulators made their decisions and how they intendto conduct future reviews. The regulators' decisions are in practice based on theapplication of well established assumptions which need change little betweenreviews; but this has not prevented a perception of uncertainty, indicating theneed for better communication with key stakeholders. To tackle the perceptionof uncertainty regulators should share the financial models they use tocalculate price controls, and set out the principles on which future reviews willbe based. OFWAT have already committed to do this.PIPES AND WIRESPIPES AND WIRES executive summary 11D. Risks associated with the process of RPI - X regulation: VI The regulators should specify clearly and well in advance what information they will need from companies during price reviews and gather as much of theinformation as is cost-justified on an annual basis. All regulators we examined have sought to set out their information requirements clearly and in advance oftheir price reviews. And yet the strong perception among regulated companiesis that regulators have asked for unnecessary information. This implies thatregulators have not communicated clearly enough why they need theinformation and how they have used it. The regulators' review of regulatoryaccounts provides a good opportunity to even out the burden of informationcollection and gives the regulators more time to verify and hence rely on theinformation they receive. The aim should be for companies to acknowledgeafter the next review that they knew well in advance what information theywould need to supply and why it was needed. VII The regulators should publish an evaluation of their completed price reviews, and in doing so should evaluate the different types of analysis undertaken todetermine whether some would not in future justify the cost to bothregulators and companies. As the regulated networks settle down after privatisation an increasing number of components of price reviews can beexpected to be decided with sufficient accuracy without detailed analysis,bearing in mind that forecasts of future performance are inherently inexact inany case. By simplifying the price review process to elements of substantialimportance to customers, the regulators ought in future to be able to reduce thecosts of the process and concentrate on what really matters. The reviewconducted by OFWAT after their 1999 review, which they placed in the publicdomain, provides a useful precedent and the regulators' joint working groupsmay also be able to play a role in this evaluation.
