I can remember a time when only spiritual types & healers like me had crystals in their home, office or meditation space. These days, crystals, geodes & gemstones are mainstream. I'm so happy about that. Many people buy crystals now because they look pretty, which is great, but they don't understand how powerful they can be and how they can help you on a daily basis. Other people I meet want to learn more about what crystals are used for in healing to enhance their well-being, but have no idea where to find the information and what to do with the crystal itself. I often work with clients to create crystal grids, but one of my favorite ways to use crystals is in meditation. In this guide, I'm going to tell you all about crystals, how they help with meditation, the types of meditations you can do with crystals and even introduce you to a tool I created called Shen So Su.
