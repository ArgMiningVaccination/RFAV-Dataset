Pharmacy. 2020;8(1):7.12 1312/15/2020 7 Assessment Hazel, Maddy, Gracie, Eloise, and Charlotte are representative of their herd. Gracie is an antivaxxer and has not been vaccinated for bovilis coronavirus (a coronavirus that causes bovine diarrhea). Which of the following is TRUE? A. Since Hazel, Maddy, Eloise, and Charlotte (meaning 80% of the herd) have been vaccinated, there is herd immunity. B. Although Hazel, Maddy, Gracie, and Charlotte (meaning 80% of the herd) have been vaccinated, herd immunity is threatened. C. Since Charlotte (meaning 20% of the herd) refuses to be vaccinated, she will develop immunity eventually if infected. Measles Isn't \"Just Measles...\" Measlesinfected patients lose 1173% of total baseline antibodies after infection Immunity only returns after reexposure to pathogens Similar loss NOT seen in MMR vaccinated children Data suggests this results in infection susceptibility in patients who had infectionor vaccineinduced immunity Mina MJ, et al.

From January 1 to December 6, 2019, 48 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. reported mumps infections in 3,252 people. Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program, clinicians reported about 186,000 cases each year (probably underestimated) Since the 2MMR dose vaccination program started in 1989, cases decreased >99%, with only a few hundred cases reported most years. Since 2006, the CDC has tracked increases in cases and outbreaks about every five years. 16 CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html. Accessed December 14, 2020. What about Mumps? Recent outbreaks have occurred in tightknit communities where vaccination rates were high. Two plausible theories these outbreaks: waning vaccineinduced immunity and immune escape. 17 CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html. Accessed December 14, 2020. Alkam, Waning vaccineinduced immunity suggests that vaccine induced immunity is fading Waning vaccine immunity increases with time since vaccination, making adults more likely to become infected than childrenImmune escape suggests that the mumps virus genetically drifted from the vaccine strains aand is no longer recognized. Implies that the current vaccine is compromised and a new vaccine must be designed to target the new mumps virus epitopes. 18CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html.

Be aware of mumps outbreak control A 3rddose of MMR prevents mumps and its complications safely and effectively in individuals at increased risk Vaccination prevents infection in individuals who have not yet been exposed or infected 20 Pharmacy Immunizations in Children Most community pharmacies provide all immunizations, but not to the youngest allowed age until recently 48 states had legislation allowing pharmacists to immunize pediatric patients in community settings Of these, 25 states do not have minimum age restrictions Only 29% of pharmacies immunized down to their state's minimum age Of the 48 states and DC that allow pharmacists to provide at least some pediatric vaccinations, median minimum age was 7 years 21Fernandes K, et al.

Vaccinedriven selection is likely when vaccines are most effective. 4342 4312/15/2020 22 Vaccine Administra on Vaccine Development Pneumococcal disease: Elders and children at an increased risk Vaccines now cover many Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes Two vaccines possess subtle differences Pneumococcal serotypes identified as \"pediatric\" caused more than half of IPD in adults older than 85 years of age before PCV7 was introduced. Before the PCV7 vaccine, statisticians saw an annual post holiday IPD spike in January among elderly people\u2014attributed to intergenerational holiday gatherings. 44CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/pneumoc occal/surveillance.html.

Vaccine Administra on Vaccine Development Once children were routinely vaccinated with PCV7, incidence of IPD caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine declined 92% in adults > 65 Notwithstanding the positive impact from each vaccine type, the incidence of diseases caused by serotypes that are not included in specific vaccines tends to increase in children and certain adult populations with underlying illnesses. Increases are usually small compared with the overall reduction in disease 45 CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/pneumoc occal/surveillance.html. Accessed December 12, 2020. Wick JY.
