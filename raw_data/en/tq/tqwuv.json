Treatment is initiated when these numbers are exceeded or for lower blood pressure in some people with cardiovascular risk factors: heredity, smoking, diabetes, excess cholesterol.

[symptoms]Trouble felt by a person with an illness. The same symptom can translate different diseases and the same disease does not necessarily give the same symptoms in all the patients. [heart rhythm disorders]Severe or benign anomaly of the frequency of contractions of the heart.
