This continuing education course also covers information with regard to universal precautions for healthcare workers and implications for the massage therapist. CE Hours: 1 Infectious Disease: Hepatitis With over 6 million Americans infected with one or more forms of viral hepatitis, practitioners must understand the impact this growing problem has on both their clients and their practice. Learn about the history, etiology and pathophysiology of hepatitis, as well as how to differentiate between several viral hepatitis types, their associated symptoms, modes of transmission, preventive measures, treatments and risks. Of particular value to massage therapists are the guidelines pertaining to Universal Precautions; including hand washing, laundering and equipment sanitization. Also covered are common misconceptions, conventional therapeutic options and alternative treatments for viral hepatitis. By learning about viral hepatitis, this two credit course meets the increased demand for knowledgeable practitioners administering safe and cognizant bodywork on all clients. CE Hours: 2 This course meets the communicable disease requirement for Maryland and for most other states. Carter Beckett, LMT 9/11/2014 This is truely an interesting, comprehensive. and informative course. I recommend this class to all complementary health care providers, as well as anyone who interested in this disease and it's prevention. Lori Kelly, NCTMB 1/19/2013 This course was full of information that is valuable to the lay person as well as people in the healthcare industry. It is especially pertinent to massage therapists who are coming into contact with people on a daily basis. I found this course very easy to understand and it was written in non-technical terms so that is was engaging and useful. Ernest Cormier, LMT 8/15/2014 Really up to date information and I especially liked the inclusion of non - medical approaches for support for Hepatitis (i.e. Especially positive and negative Vitamins & Herbs). Very thorough massage and HIV section. Good Info, Thanks. Bernadette Carlton, LMT 10/3/2014 The information is thorough and to the point. It is presented in a easily readable way. It serves to restore my awareness of communicable diseases and the many ways we can encounter and also avoid the proliferation of them. The statistics and science, although dry and not easy to retain for me, creates a marker of progress that medicine has made to fight these insidious and very distinct viruses.
