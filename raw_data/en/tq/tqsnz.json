Such a breach, in the practice or home-care setting, can lead to medical, social, and nancial impacts on patients, clients, and staff, as well as damage the reputation of the hospital. To mitigate these negative outcomes, the AAHA ICPB Guidelines Task Force believes that hospital teams should improve upon their current efforts by limiting pathogen exposure from entering or being transmitted throughout thehospital population and using surveillance methods to detect any new entry of a pathogen into the practice. To support theserecommendations, these practice-oriented guidelines include step-by-step instructions to upgrade ICPB efforts in any hospital, including recommendations on the following: establishing an infection control practitioner to coordinate and implement the ICPB program; developing evidence-based standard operating procedures related to tasks performed frequently by the veterinary team(hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, phone triage, etc.); assessing the facility 's ICPB strengths and areas of improvement; creating a staff education and training plan; cataloging client education material speci c for use in the practice; implementing a surveillance program; and maintaining a compliance evaluation program. Practices with few or no ICPB protocols should beencouraged to take small steps. Creating visible evidence that these protocols are consistently implemented within the hospitalwill invariably strengthen the loyalties of clients to the hospital as well as deepen the pride the staff have in their roles, both of whichare the basis of successful veterinary practice.

Stull was the chair of the Infection Control, Prevention, and Bio- security Guidelines Task Force. \u00aa2018 by American Animal Hospital Association JAAHA.ORG 1Introduction and Objectives Without effective infection contr ol, prevention, and biosecurity (ICPB) implemented in the veterinary primary care and referral settings, the clinician 's efforts at disease prevention and treatment are compromised and, in some cases, nulli ed. Thus, ICPB is at the heart of the veterinarian 's pledge to protect animal health and welfare and public health, as well as the universal mandate amongthe healing professions to \"rst, do no harm. \"Hospital-acquired infections (HAI), sometimes refer red to as nosocomial infections, are an inherent risk in human and veterinary medicine, andbreaches in ICPB can have direct and indirect nancial, social, and environmental impacts on pat ients, clients, and staff. In a practical sense, any practitioner who doubts the value of ICPBneed only experience a client 'sd i s p l e a s u r e ,a na n i m a l 's health complications, or the consequences of an un flattering online re- view when a pet contracts infectious enteritis or respiratory dis-ease during boarding or hospitalization or requires postsurgicaltreatment due to an HAI. 1The fact is, our best work can be undone by an infection control breach in the practice or home-care setting. The AAHA Infection Control, Prevention, andBiosecurity Guidelines are the rst clinician-focused and practice- oriented guidelines on this topic developed speci cally for use in companion animal medicine. As su ch, these guidelines comple- ment the growing emphasis in human medicine on infectioncontrol to prevent HAIs and exposure of patients and workers toinfectious pathogens in the practice or laboratory and build offexisting veterinary best practi ce and topic-focused documents. such asmethicillin-resistant staphylococci in HAIs has created addi-tional urgency for effective ICPB. Adding to the risk associated with ICPB lapses is the potential for in-hospital exposure to zoonotic diseases such as leptospirosis, rabies, salmonellosis,campylobacteriosis, and infections with ecto- and endoparasites(e.g., fleas, ticks, and helminths). Taken together, these factors created a strong motivation to assemble a task force of experts toproduce these ICPB guidelines. As many HAI likely occur unnoticed, solely relying upon the awareness of outbreaks as a measure of effective ICPB practicesresults in a false sense of security and unnecessary patient and staff health risks. As such, effective ICPB is dependent on the development of and adherence to standardized processes andprotocols followed by self-audit and protocol adjustment. Theseguidelines provide a conceptual roadmap and speci c, practical guidance on how to institute and evaluate ICPB standard operatingprocedures (SOPs) that will safeguard patients, staff, and clientsfrom avoidable exposure to infectious pathogens. It is importantto acknowledge that not all HAI will be prevented by following ICPB SOPs; however, studies indicate 10 -70% of all HAIs in human medicine are preventable by using practical infectioncontrol measures, an estimate that is likely applicable to veteri-nary medicine. 8E v e na1 0 %r e d u c t i o ni nH A Iw o u l dh a v el a r g e impacts on patient health, owner cost, and owner and staff satis-faction. Implementing the various protocols speci ed in these guide- lines or provided as online resources may seem daunting at rst. However, most practices already effectively apply many infectioncontrol procedures as an aspect of sound clinical practice. Theseguidelines will nevertheless help any primary care or referralpractices to systematize and strengthen their existing ICPBprotocols and enlist the entire healthcare team in this essentialaspect of high-quality veterinary care. To that end, the guidelinespresent a progression of interventions from most to least critical.Therefore, veterinary practices can implement the recommen-dations of the ICPB task force incrementally without beingoverwhelmed by attempting an immediate, complete overhaul of ICPB protocols. As ICPB principles become part of a practice 'sc u l t u r e ,t h e healthcare team can more con dently admit and treat all patients, including those with emerging or endemic infectious diseases, while minimizing the risk of exposing other patients, staff,and clients. An effective approach, strongly recommended bythe ICPB task force, is to appoint a practice \"champion \"who takes primary responsibility for implementing ICPB proto-cols and ensuring staff compliance. This individual should fo-cus on the two principal components of ICPB, which are to(1) limit pathogen introducti on, exposure, transmission, and infection within the hospital population; and (2) evaluatethe effectiveness of infection control practices at controllingdisease. 9,10 There are limited data and evidence-based studies that clearly measure the added bene ts of infection control practices in vet- erinary practices.9,10Nonetheless, the prevailing opinion within the profession, supported by evidence from other healthcare elds, is that veterinarians can more widely implement effective ICPBprotocols and conduct staff training on ICPB to protect patient,staff, and client health. 6,9,11To help ll this void, the guidelines represent the consensus recommendations of experts with exten-sive ICPB experience in veterinary medicine and public health.Their recommendations re flect the latest scienti c data, clinical expertise, and best practices for infection control. Thus, theseguidelines address the growing public awareness of HAI, theemergence of drug-resistant microbes and infections, and the ex-pectation that veterinary medicine will match or exceed ICPB 2 JAAHA | 54:6 Nov/Dec 2018initiatives in human medicine. More speci cally, the objectives of the guidelines are to \u00b7Help veterinary practice teams understand the importance of ICPB and why it should be prioritized. \u00b7Help practice teams implement appropriate ICPB protocols that enhance patient care and safety. \u00b7Provide general concepts that guide effective ICPB (versus ex- haustive information on all potential pathogens). \u00b7Provide speci csurveillance strategies and protocols that will allow practices to self-audit, assess, and adjust their SOPs for infection control. \u00b7Provide resources for motivating and training staff to under- stand, implement, and comply with ICPB strategies. \u00b7Provide practical information that can be adapted as client ed- ucation materials. Conversely, the purpose of the guidelines is notto focus on hospital design or the judicious use of antimicrobial agents, two ancillary topics that are more appropriately reviewed in otherforums and publications. When the ICPB objectives listed above are met, it will inherently advance the quality of care provided byyour practice . When clients see visible evidence that ICPB pro- tocols are consistently implemented by your healthcare team(e.g., barrier precautions, take-home postsurgical instructions,posted ICPB protocols), it will invariably strengthen the mutualloyalties of the veterinarian-client-patient relationship that isthe basis of successful veterinary practice. Principles of Infection Control, Prevention, and Biosecurity Routes of Transmission Infection control and prevention depends on disrupting the trans- mission of pathogens from their source (the infected animal orhuman) to new hosts (animal or human) or locations. 7,12Under- standing routes of disease transmission and how it contributesto the spread of organisms allows for the identi cation of effective prevention and control measures not only for speci c diseases, but also other pathogens transmitt ed by a similar route, including unanticipated infectious diseases. 12The transmission of microor- ganisms can be divided into the following ve main routes: direct contact, fomites, aerosol (airborne), oral (ingestion), and vector-borne. Some microorganisms can be transmitted by more than one route. Direct Contact Transmission Direct contact transmission occurs through direct body contactwith the tissues or fluids of an infected individual. Physical transfer and entry of microorganisms occurs through mucous membranes(e.g., eyes, mouth), open wounds, or abraded skin. Direct in-oculation can occur from bites or scratches. Examples includeo r g a n i s m ss u c ha sr a b i e s , Microsporum, Leptospira spp., and and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP). This is probably the most common and highest-risk route of pathogen transmission to patientsand personnel. Fomite Transmission Fomite transmission involves inanimate objects contaminated by aninfected individual that then come in contact with a susceptibleanimal or human. Fomites can include a wide variety of objects suchas exam tables, cages, kennels, medical equipment, environmentalsurfaces, and clothing. Disease examples include canine parvovirusand feline calicivirus infections. Aerosol (Airborne) Transmission Aerosol transmission encompasses the transfer of pathogens via very small particles or droplet nuclei. Aerosol particles may be inhaled by a susceptible host or deposited onto mucous mem-branes or environmental surfaces. This can occur from breathing,coughing, sneezing, or vocalization of an infected individual,but also during certain medical procedures (e.g., suctioning,bronchoscopy, dentistry, inhalation anesthesia). Very small par-ticles may remain suspended in the air for extended periodsand be disseminated by air currents in a room or through a fa-cility. However, most pathogens pertinent to companion ani-mal veterinary medicine do not survive in the environment forextended periods or do not travel great distances due to size andas a result require close proximity or contact for disease trans-mission. Examples of common aerosolized pathogens includeBordetella bronchiseptica ,c a n i n ei n fluenza, and canine distemper virus. Oral (Ingestion) Transmission The ingestion of pathogenic organisms can occur from contami-nated food or water as well as by licking or chewing on contam-inated objects or surfaces. Environmental contamination is mostcommonly due to exudates, feces, urine, or saliva. Examples ofdiseases acquired via oral transmission include feline panleukopeniaand infections caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Escherichia coli , andLeptospira. Vector-Borne TransmissionVectors are living organisms that can transfer pathogenic mi-croorganisms to other animals or locations and includeICPB Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 3arthropod vectors (e.g., mosquitoes, fleas, ticks) and rodents or other vermin. Vector-borne transmission can be an important route of transmission in climates where these pests exist year-round and may be brought into the practice by an infested pa-tient. Examples of vector-borne diseases include heartwormdisease, Bartonella infection, Lyme disease (borreliosis), and plague. Zoonotic Transmission It is important to remember many animal diseases are zoonoticand therefore pose a risk for the healthcare team as well asclients. The transfer of these agents can occur by the same ve routes of transmission described above. Examples of zoonoticpathogens include Microsporum, Leptospira, Campylobacter ,a n d Bartonella . Hierarchy of Controls The hierarchy of controls concept, often used to address measurestaken to reduce workplace hazards, is useful when considering in- fection control strategies in veterinary settings . 7,13- 17Figure 1 shows a four-tier hierarchy pyramid that can be used to determine ef- fective ICPB procedures such as changes in facility design, poli-cies or procedures, and wearing protective clothing. The toptiers are generally considered more effective at minimizing haz-ards (e.g., pathogen exposure) than the lower tiers. 15,16Often, a combination of control measures are needed to effectively reduceexposures. 16 Elimination of sources of pathogen exposure involves physi- cally removing (or preventing) the hazard (i.e., pathogen) fromentering the facility. 15,16Although completely eliminating infected animals from a facility is unlikely to occur, measures can be taken toprevent patients from infecting the general population. Whileelimination controls are the most effective at reducing hazards, theyare often the most dif cult to implement. 15 Engineering controls include measures designed into the fa- cility to remove a hazard at its source or to improve compliancewith infection control procedures. 4,7,15,16These measures can be highly effective but generally have higher initial costs.4,13 -17 Administrative controls include protocols or changes to work practices, policies, or procedures to keep patients or staff separatedfrom a known hazard as well as providing staff with information,training, and supervision for these measures. Administrative con-trols address the way people work and how animals move throughthe hospital (traf cflow) when an onsite infectious disease is known or suspected. 4,13 -17 Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes the use of special clothing and equipment to protect staff and patients whomay be exposed to known or suspected pathogens.13,15,16PPE places a barrier between staff and an exposure risk (e.g., infectedanimal, diagnostic specimens) and with appropriate use, helpsprevent the spread of pathogens b etween animals and within the practice. The use of PPE is considered a relatively less effectivemeans of controlling exposures because it relies on human factorssuch as staff compliance and appropriate education and train-ing. 4,15Although less effective, lower tiers (e.g., PPE) remain critical for effective infection control and should be used whenindicated. Table 1 provides examples of hier archy of control measures that can be applied to disrupt pat hogen transmission and provide infection control for a variety of microorganisms. Implementing an Infection Control, Prevention, and Biosecurity Program Every veterinary practice should have a documented ICPB program. At a minimum, this should be a collection of agreed-upon basicinfection control practices and accompanying SOPs, growing intoaf o r m a lm a n u a li n c o r p o r a t i n gs p e c i cs t a f fe d u c a t i o na n d training, client education, surveillance, and compliance pro-grams. The pros-pect of developing or re ning an existing in- fection control program may seem daunting to veterinary staff.Most staff have not received formal training in this area, and the FIGURE 1 An inverted pyramid depicting tiers of the hierarchy of control methods used in determining effective infection control proce-dures to disrupt pathogen spread.

However, the process of instituting a pro- gram need not be an \"all or none \"a p p r o a c h .I m p o r t a n t l y ,a signicant percentage of HAIs in veterinary practices can likely be prevented with proper compliance to basic, practical infec-tion control practices that a hospital can build over time. 18An incremental approach to program development and re nement can be done in a step-by-step process that is practical, eco-nomical, and effective. Ordered steps to develop an ICPB programare as follows: 1.Assign a staff member to oversee and champion the devel- opment of and implementation of the ICPB program. Com- monly referred to as the infection control practitioner(ICP) or infection preventionist, this individual serves acritical role in infection control (1) program develop-ment, maintenance, compliance, and evaluation; (2) stafftraining development and documentation; (3) protocolcompliance evaluation; and (4) receipt of actionable in-fection control concerns, including suspected HAIs. Time commitments will vary with attributes of the practice (e.g., size, caseload, existing SOPs) but in most casescan be accomplished by an existing practice technicianor veterinarian who has an interest, but not necessarilyspeci c training, in infection control. The factors most critical to success are an interest in the topic, motivationto make improvements, and support (e.g., enthusiasm,nancial resources and incentives, time) of practice leaders. Existing resources are available in the humanand veterinary elds that provide an engaged practice member with the guidance, skills, and tools to besuccessful. 4,5,7,8,18- 21Because staff acceptance, support, and respect for established protocols are critical to a pro-gram 's success, the ICP should keep staff engaged (e.g., regular program updates, surveillance ndings, eval- uations; seek and respond to infection control-relatedfeedback; involve staff in SOP development and re-view). Additional resources can be found at aaha.org/biosecurity. 2.Identify and develop protocols and checklists. Protocols serve as the main resource for guidance of many compo-nents of an ICPB program and should be compiled withinan infection control manual. To be effective, protocolsmust consist of agreed-upon steps that will be taken byall practice members. Existing protocols developed asgeneral guidance or for a speci c practice are an excellent starting point for ICPs. 4,7Protocols should be customized for the given needs and resources of the practice. Sampleprotocols for key areas of a practice 'sI C P Bp r o g r a mi n - clude \u00b7Hand hygiene ( Table 2 ). \u00b7Cleaning and disinfection ( Table 3). \u00b7Sequence for putting on and removing PPE ( Table 4). \u00b7Identifying high-risk patients; questions to ask when mak-ing appointments ( Table 5). \u00b7Placing and maintaining IV and urinary catheters ( Tables 6, 7). \u00b7Entering and exiting isolation or dedicated areas for high-risk patients ( Table 8). \u00b7Necropsy procedures ( Table 9). \u00b7Checklists of key tasks are known to improve compli-ance throughout the practice workplace, including in-fection control and the reduction of HAIs. 22Checklists are encouraged for cleaning and disinfection, surgery(pre- and postoperative), and any commonly performedduty that bene ts from a reminder and communication system. 3.Perform an initial assessment of the facility to identifystrengths and areas for improvement. To best prioritize re- sources, ICPs should identify ICPB strengths and weaknessof the practice. Tools have been developed to assist with thisprocess ( Table 10 ). Regardless of the tool used, it is most important that all key areas of a program are examined(e.g., hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, identi cation of procedures used to treat and house high-risk patients, PPE)and the continuum of effective risk mitigation is included(e.g., presence of written protocols, staff knowledge of andcompliance with protocols). A properly performed assess-ment will indicate areas of the facility on which to focusmost immediate attention. The ICP should then begin todevelop and re ne an infection control manual containing protocols for identi ed areas. 4.Develop a staff education and training plan. All personnel, including temporary lay personnel, kennel staff, veterinar-ians, technicians, receptionists, students, and volunteers,should receive education and training about infection con-trol. Training should occur during orientation and at leastannually. Training should be tailored to individual job duties,but in all cases emphasize health risks and existing protocolsto reduce patient, staff, and client infection-related hazards.A checklist of required readings, meetings with key staff, andelectronic resources to review should be provided and comple-tion documented. An assessment (examination) to documentstaff knowledge and comprehension should be performedafter trainings. 6 JAAHA | 54:6 Nov/Dec 20185.Identify a staff member to collect client education materials specic for use in your practice. Efforts should be made to identify, catalog, and make readily available appropriatematerials that assist clients in understanding infectious andzoonotic disease risks and the basic steps they can take toprotect themselves, household members, and their animals.TABLE 2 Protocol for Hand Hygiene Using Soap and Water or Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer21 Hand Wash (Soap and Water) Hand Rub (AHS) Turn on water \u2014 Wet hands \u2014 Dispense appropriate amount of product directly onto hands (e.g., 1-2 pumps from dispenser)Dispense appropriate amount of product directly onto hands (e.g., 1-2 pumps from dispenser) Apply product to all surfaces of hands; min. 15 s contact time Apply product to all surfaces of hands; min. 15 s contact time Palms Palms Back of hands Back of hands Between ngers Between ngers Finger tips Finger tips Thumb and thumb web Thumb and thumb web 6Wrists 6Wrists Rinse all surfaces of hands with water \u2014 Dry hands thoroughly with single-use towel Rub hands until dry Turn water off, using drying towel to avoid direct contact with faucet handles (unless automatic faucet present)\u2014 Discard towel \u2014 TOTAL TIME: w30-60 s TOTAL TIME: w20-30 s AHS, alcohol-based hand sanitizer TABLE 3 Example of an Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection Protocol (Adapted)20 \u00b7Have all material safety data sheets or product safety data sheets for cleaning and disinfection materials available. Follow instructions for proper mixing, disposal, and PPE (e.g., gloves, eye protection). As able, ensure the area is well ventilated. \u00b7Exam rooms and cages should be cleaned and disinfected immediately following use. Place signage at the room entry that it should not be used until cleaning and disinfection is completed. \u00b7As applicable, remove all bedding and organic material (e.g., feces, feed, hair, linens, bandage, or other materials) and dispose in designated waste bin. Glovesshould be worn during this procedure. \u00b7\"Dry\"-clean surfaces (e.g., sweeping, wiping with disposable microber cloth) to remove loose organic material. \u00b7\"Wet\"-clean surfaces with warm water and detergent. Scrubbing surfaces is often necessary to remove feces or bodily fluids, biolms, and stubborn organic debris,especially in animal housing areas. \u00b7Rinse with clean water. For all rinsing and product application procedures, care must be exercised to avoid overspray. High-pressure washing should be avoided.Higher pressures can help remove stubborn organic debris but may also force debris and organisms into crevices or porous materials, from which they can later emerge. Additionally, high-pressure washing causes aerosolization and overspray, which may spread organisms widely, even into previously uncontaminated areas. \u00b7Allow the area to dry or manually do so. If excess water remains, subsequently applied disinfectants may be diluted to the point of inefcacy. \u00b7Apply disinfectant solution at the indicated concentration and ensure the appropriate contact time (allotted time required for disinfectant to remain wet on the surfaceto kill the pathogens of interest; time is based on the product, concentration, and targeted pathogens but generally 5-10 min). Rinse thoroughly with clean water; this is especially important for disinfectants that leave a residue or for surfaces vulnerable to damage from the disinfectant. Always follow the disinfectant label ( Figure 2 ) for appropriate use, concentration, and contact time (see Figures 3, 4; Table 11 for choosing a disinfectant). \u00b7Allow the treated area to dry as much as possible before reintroducing animals or reusing the area. \u00b7In known contaminated or high-risk areas, a second application of a disinfectant with wide spectrum (e.g., accelerated hydrogen peroxide product) should be considered as a nal decontamination step. Ensure appropriate contact time, rinse with clean water, and allow the treated area to dry, as stated above.

Surveillance, the routine collection of information with de ned responses, is critical for effective infection control. It provides feedbackto determine if a practice 's infection control practices are effective at controlling disease, helps to identify areas ofweakness, and provides a warning to allow for an early re-sponse to a concern, reducing patient and staff illness, ex-penses, and time. Many forms of surveillance are easy,inexpensive, and can be readily incorporated into day-to-day veterinary practice. Some form of surveillance (eitherpassive or active) should be used by all veterinary facilities.Passive surveillance involves using data that are already avail-able (e.g., client-paid bacterial culture and susceptibility re-sults, identi ed surgical site infections [SSIs]) to determine clinically relevant elements such as disease rates, antimicro-bial susceptibility patterns, and trends and identify changesTABLE 4 Sequence for Donning and Dof ng of Personal Protective Equipment21 Donning PPE (Putting on) Dofng PPE (Taking off) 1.

The gown is then peeled down off the body and arms, balling or rolling in the contaminated surfaces (front and sleeves). This is difcult to do, however, without contaminating thehands. The preferred method for dofng a disposable gown and gloves is, therefore, to break the ties at the neck by pulling on the upper front portion of the gown with the hands still gloved, balling or rolling in the contaminated surfaces, and pulling the gloves off inside-out as the hands are withdrawn from the gown's sleeves. The gown and gloves can then be placed in a disposal receptacle together.PPE, personal protective equipment. TABLE 5 Identifying High-Risk Patients: Questions to Ask When Making Appointments5* \u00b7Age of the patient. \u00b7Vaccination history. \u00b7Recent history: Has the pet been to a boarding kennel, dog park, day care facility, animal shelter, or other similar venue in the past month? Traveled to another area or country?Are other pets in the household ill? \u00b7Acute vomiting? \u00b7Acute diarrhea (dened as three or more loose stools during the past 24 hr) or episodes of bloody diarrhea? \u00b7Acute coughing? \u00b7Acute sneezing? \u00b7Fever (if known)? If the patient is acutely coughing, sneezing, vomiting, or having diarrhea, 6a fever, the pet should not enter the reception area. Evaluate such animals before entry into the building or immediately transport them to a dedicated examination or isolation room depending on practice policy. If the hospital records indicate that the pet has a multidrug-resistant infection, the pet should not enter the reception area.* Patients tting these criteria should not enter the reception area. Meet owners outside and escort them in via a separate entrance or use a carrier or gurney to transportthe pet through the reception area if necessary. Use alternative waiting/examination locations or use of barrier precautions based on the initial risk assessment. Clean anddisinfect any waiting or examination locations occupied before using those areas again for other animals. 8 JAAHA | 54:6 Nov/Dec 2018TABLE 6 Placement and Maintenance of Peripheral Intravenous Catheters to Prevent Infection5 1. Clip hair from the proposed site of catheter insertion. 2. Perform hand hygiene and put on clean examination gloves.3. Use gauze sponges, sterile saline, and chlorhexidine scrub diluted with sterile saline to between 0.5 and 2% chlorhexidine. 4. Perform hand hygiene and put on sterile or clean gloves to insert the catheter. Do not reuse a catheter after a failed attempt. 5. Attach a catheter cap, T set, or suitable extension set to the catheter, and flush the catheter with sterile saline solution. Carefully secure the catheter with tape and cover it with sterile bandage materials. Povidone iodine ointment may be applied at the site of entry into the skin. 6. Examine the catheter site at least two times daily. Observe for pain and evaluate for evidence of swelling or thrombophlebitis. If the bandage is not clean and dry, replace the bandage. If there is any evidence of thrombophlebitis and the catheter is still necessary, replace the catheter in a different site. 7. When IV lines are disconnected (e.g., to take a dog for a walk), the sites of connection should be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol single-use wipes and capped with injection caps. Do not reuse injection caps. 8. IV tubing used for fluid administration should be changed every 72 hr. The IV tubing used for TPN administration should be changed every time a new bag of TPN is placed, or every 24 hr, whichever is more frequent. TPN, total parenteral nutrition.

Clean at the junction of the patient and the external portion of the catheter every 24 hr with sterile gauze sponges, alternating between dilute skin antiseptic solution and sterile saline (greater than or equal to three scrubs with each solution). Managing the closed collection system \u00b7Do not administer prophylactic antimicrobials; these increase the risk of hospital-acquired resistant infections and have not been shown to prevent infection. Give antimicrobials only for documented infection. \u00b7Position collection bags lower than the animal to allow urine to flow by gravity. Prevent retrograde flow of urine from the collection bag back into the patient because this may cause iatrogenic urinary tract infection with resistant organisms. The collection system clamp should be closed when the patient is moved or walked and immediately reopened once the collection bag is again lower than the patient. Check patency of the tubing hourly. \u00b7Culturing the urine (via cystocentesis) at the time of catheter removal is only indicated if there is evidence of cystitis. Urine culture results drawn from indwellingcatheters (not recommended) should be interpreted with caution. Do not culture the tip of a removed catheter.ICPB Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 9that may indicate an important infection control problem (e.g., increase in SSI rate). Routine recording of animals withspecic diagnoses (e.g., SSIs, MDR organisms) or syndromes (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, coughing) is another simple methodof collecting information that can help in the preventionand early detection of outbreaks. The key to passive surveil-lance is to centralize available data, with the ICP compilingand evaluating data and reporting results on a regular basis.Many electronic medical record systems can be set to trackand report on certain diagnostic codes that the ICP hasdesignated for surveillance. Active surveillance involves gath-ering data speci cally for infection control purposes. An in- expensive, highly effective example of active surveillance forenvironmental cleaning is fluorescent tagging. This process involves applying marks only visible under ultraviolet light(so staff are not aware marks have been placed) that are easily removed with routine cleaning and monitoring surfaces for presence of marks after cleaning was to occur (e.g., 24 hr aftermark placement). 23Regularly marking and collecting this information provides insight into cleaning de ciencies (e.g., locations or objects often missed), allowing for targeted ad-justment to cleaning and disinfection protocols or staff train-ing. Culturing environmental surfaces or diagnostic samplesfrom animals is another example of active surveillance, butdue to expense would generally be reserved for an outbreakinvestigation.TABLE 8 Sample Protocol for Entering and Exiting an Isolation (or Similarly Dedicated) Area5 Entering and exiting isolation rooms 1. Before entering the isolation area, remove practice outerwear (e.g., laboratory coat) and any equipment (e.g., stethoscope, scissors, thermometer, watch, cell phone) and leave outside the isolation unit/anteroom. 2. Gather any necessary supplies and medications before putting on PPE.3. Wash hands or use alcohol hand rub, and then put on booties, gown, and gloves before entering the isolation room (see Table 4 for proper procedures).4. Attend to the patient in isolation as needed. DO NOT bring treatment sheets, pens, or electronic devices such as laptops, cell phones, or tablets into the isolation room. 5. Clean and disinfect any equipment used while caring for the patient.6. Before leaving the isolation room, remove PPE (see Table 4; remove booties last as stepping out of the isolation room and avoid touching the outer surface of the boots). Clean and disinfect nondisposable PPE (e.g., eye protection). Place used disposable PPE in the trash container lined with a biohazard bag in the isolation room. DO NOT SAVE DISPOSABLE PPE FOR REUSE. Avoid contact with external portions of the door when exiting the isolation room. 7. Wash hands with soap and water, and then disinfect any surfaces (e.g., doorknobs) that may have accidentally been contaminated when the room was exited. Make any needed chart entries. Wash hands again before leaving the anteroom (as applicable). PPE, personal protective equipment.

Although the development of an effective ICPB programis a primary goal, only with regular compliance self-auditing can a practice ensure that their practices align withtheir protocols, goals are being met, and continued im-provement occurs, resulting in lowering HAIs and workersafety risks. A comprehensive audit can build from thepreviously mentioned initial assessment using the sameaudit tool. The audit should include inspection of the phys-ical environment, review of workplace ICPB practices,and assessment of workers 'knowledge and application of infection control principles. Reg ular audits (at least annually) by the ICP will allow for the establishment of benchmarks, identifyand prioritize needs, and identify resources and timelines tomeet benchmarks. Incorporating other team members in theaudit process is encouraged to provide additional perspectivesand further buy-in by practice staff. General Procedures for a Veterinary Infection Control, Prevention, andBiosecurity Program As the foundation for infection control practices, patient and staff flow, hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, and PPE should be addressed in all practice ICPB programs.

Taking an appropriate history prior to patient arrival can pre- vent pathogen introduction. SOPs and staff training should addressidentifying high-risk patients when possible during appointmentscheduling (Table 5). When an infectious disease is suspected prior tothe appointment, the client should be instructed to call upon arrivaland use a designated path to an appropriate, dedicated area for ex-amination. Practices should determine the best path based on theirfacility, with the intention of minimizing contact with the generalpatient population and staff. Animals suspected or con rmed to pose a high risk ( Table 12 ) should be examined and housed in a dedicated isolation area. Because an isolation room may not always be available,facilities should develop an SOP for where and how such animals willbe housed. Facilities 'procedures should be consistent with those used for isolation (i.e., housed physically and procedurally separate fromother patients; Table 8). Complete discussion of facility design isbeyond the scope of these guidelines. 4,19 Some patients will be identi ed as potentially infectious during the appointment or while hospitalized. In such cases, staff shouldminimize owner and patient contact with other patients, staff, andsurfaces (e.g., provide outpatient treatments and complete checkoutprocess in the same exam room or designated infection control area).Staff should identify places where contact between infectious patientsand other patients or where exposure to common areas may haveoccurred. These areas should be promptly cleaned and disinfected. Hand Hygiene Hand hygiene, using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer(AHS), is the responsibility of all individuals involved in healthcare.Generally considered the single most important way to prevent infectionsin healthcare, hand hygiene should be the subject of considerable at- tention to availability, encouragement, and compliance auditing. 21,24 Effective hand hygiene kills or removes microorganisms on the skin while maintaining skin integrity (i.e., prevents skin chapping and cracking). The objective is to reduce the number of microorganisms,particularly those that are part of the transient micro flora of the skin, because these are easily shed and include the majority of opportunisticpathogens. In most circumstances, either method of hand hygiene (soapand water or AHS) is effective if performed appropriately and when indicated (Table 2). In the practice, hand hygiene should occur \u00b7Immediately before and after patient contact, especially inva- sive procedures. \u00b7Before and after contact with items in the patient 's environ- ment. \u00b7After exposure to patient bodily fluids (e.g., discharge, speci- men handling). \u00b7Before putting on gloves and especially after glove removal. \u00b7After using the restroom. \u00b7Before eating. AHS is the preferred method when hands are not visibly soiled because these products have a superior ability to kill microorganismsIsolating an Infectious Patient As an example, before a dog suspected of parvovirus arrives at a practice, staff should consider \u00b7Mode of transmission for the suspected pathogen (in this case most likely to be spread by fecal, direct, or fomitetransmission). \u00b7Individuals with anticipated patient contact should wearappropriate PPE (i.e., gowns, gloves). \u00b7Carrying the patient or use a gurney with a disposablecover through a separate entrance directly into the examor isolation room. \u00b7Use of a similar transport procedure for patient 's admis- sion to isolation or during practice discharge. \u00b7Use of a disinfectant that is effective against parvovirus.TABLE 12 Pathogens of Greatest Infection Control Concern for a Small Animal Hospital6 \u00b7Adenovirus (canine) \u00b7Bordetella bronchiseptica \u00b7Leptospira 13 Recommended Cleaning and Disinfection Frequency for Common Environmental Surfaces in Veterinary Practices4 Surface or Object Procedures Special Considerations Horizontal surfaces with low patient contact (e.g., front desk, records area)1.

Due to the risk of pre- existing defects, puncture, or tears during use andpotential contamination of the hands when removing (and of sterile gloves when putting on), hand hygienebefore and after glove use remains as important as before and after patient contact when gloves are not used Single-use gowns or dedicated laboratory coatsSingle-use disposable gowns, reusable cloth gowns, or laboratory coats that are laundered after each applicable patient contact or procedure. Clothing worn underneath must be completely covered from thewrists and waist to the collar at a minimum, depending on the size and type of patient. Use of coveralls is also an option for animals requiring extensive handling,especially on the floor.Any scenario in which there is increased risk of hand or clothing contamination with a larger number of microbes or any number of highly virulent, resistant, or transmissible microbes,for example: \u00b7Any animal with potential respiratory tractinfection, diarrhea, skin infection, fever ofunknown origin \u00b7Oral manipulation or procedures (e.g.,dentistry) \u00b7Exposure to potentially infectious fluids or discharge (e.g., obstetric procedures, necropsy, handling of clinical samples orsoiled linens and other items)Disposable gowns and laboratory coats are typically permeable to liquids, especially with prolonged or heavy contact; therefore, additional precautions may be required to prevent microbial strike-through Face mask Single-use disposable surgical mask along with eye protection or reusable full-face shield consisting of a stiff clear plastic sheet that covers the face from forehead to chin. Each face shield should be dedicatedto a single person but should be discarded or fully reprocessed (i.e., cleaned and disinfected) if it becomes visibly contaminated or comes in contactwith a contaminated surface (including used glove), and between patients.Any scenario in which there is a signicant splash risk or risk of droplet transmission, forinstance: \u00b7Dental procedures\u00b7Wound lavage\u00b7Potentially zoonotic respiratory disease with productive coughing or sneezing\u00b7Necropsy (especially if any potential risk of rabies)\u00b7A face shield may be more appropriate for individuals with heavy facial hair that is not adequately covered by a mask.\u00b7Does not protect against airborne pathogens\u2014this requires a properly tted respirator (N95 or higher) Eye protection Typically, reusable plastic goggles that wrap around the sides of the face or include side-protectors or a full-face shieldPoorly tted eye protection can cause visibility issues from fogging or slipping.Regular eyeglasses are not a substitute because they do not fully protect the eyes, particularly from the lateral aspect Shoe covers or dedicated footwear Single-use disposable cloth or plastic boots that t over regular footwear or reusable slip-on footwear that iseasily cleaned and disinfected (e.g., rubber boots)Any scenario in which there is suspected to be signicant contamination of the floor with ahigh-risk substance, for example: \u00b7Dog with leptospirosis housed on the floor\u00b7Infectious vomiting or diarrhea, particularlyin large dogs housed on the floor \u00b7Management of large open wounds if floorcould become contaminated with dischargeor lavage fluidDisposable plastic shoe covers can create a slipping hazard if they do not have treads.Not commonly needed in small animal practices; however, contamination of the floor must always be carefully considered because of the high degree ofcontact of patients and staff with the floor. 18 JAAHA | 54:6 Nov/Dec 2018FIGURE 2 Understanding the information on a disinfectant product label is essential for effective disease organism removal and the safety of those handling the product. Always read the product label before use. It is a violation of federal law to use a product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.

When these pathogens are suspected, washing hands with soap andwater is encouraged. Bar soaps should never be used in practices dueto risks for microbial contamination and transfer to other person-nel. Dispenser-provided liquid or foam soap should be used; ifcontainers will be re lled, they must rst be disinfected. Cleaning and Disinfection The environment and equipment in veterinary hospitals can serve asimportant routes of pathogen transmission to patients, owners, andstaff. 26,27Cleaning and disinfection aim to reduce key pathogens. However, when cleaning and disinfection are improperly performed,pathogens are likely to remain and can result in HAIs. 28-30Cleaning and disinfection are two separate tasks. Cleaning involves theremoval of visible organic matter (e.g., feces, urine, food, dirt) withsoap or detergent, whereas disinfection involves the application of achemical to kill the remaining microbes. Cleaning is essential be-cause organic matter increases the environmental survival of manypathogens and decreases the effectiveness of many disinfectants.Surfaces that are porous (e.g., unsealed wood, concrete, grout) orwith poor integrity (e.g., cracks) are dif cult to effectively clean and disinfect and should be repaired or replaced. Disinfection can only be maximally effective if it is preceded by cleaning. Some pathogens (e.g., clostridial spores) are highly resistantto disinfection; therefore, cleaning in these cases is particularlyimportant to mechanically remove the organisms. Disinfectantsshould be selected based on pathogens of concern, compatibility withmaterials, and level of risk (Figures 3, 4; Table 11). For instance, aquaternary ammonium compound may be reasonable for routinedisinfection in general animal areas, but a disinfectant with an ex-tended spectrum (e.g., oxidizing agent that also kills nonenveloped FIGURE 3 Spectrum of selected disinfectants. 20 JAAHA | 54:6 Nov/Dec 2018viruses) would be indicated in an isolation or critical care area. To be effective and meet expected spectrum of activity, disinfectants mustbe applied at the correct dilution and for the designated contacttime (allotted time required for disinfectant to remain wet on thesurface to kill the pathogens of interest; this time is based on theproduct, concentration, and targeted pathogens, but is generally 5 - 10 min). If the disinfectant dries before the allotted time, it must bereapplied so that the surface remains wet throughout the contacttime. Use of the proper disinfectant concentration is critical from acost, effect, and safety standpoint. Because disinfectant products canhave a range of ef cacious concentrations depending on the speci c pathogen, the concentration used for disinfecting is pathogen- andsituation-dependent. ICPs should identify surfaces for cleaning and disinfection and establish a desired frequency that can be incorporated into a checklist(Table 13 ). In general, animal-contact surfaces should be cleanedand disinfected between patients. This includes exam rooms; floors where patients (e.g., large dogs) are examined/treated; and equip-ment such as thermometers, stethoscopes, bandage scissors, clippershandle and blades, otoscope handle and tips (if reused), monitoringequipment (e.g., Doppler cuffs, electrocardiogram leads), and en-dotracheal tubes. Surfaces such as lobby floors should be cleaned and disinfected on a regular basis, at least daily; when known-infectious animals have been in contact with the surface; or whensurfaces are visibly soiled with feces, urine, or body fluids (Table 11). Nonanimal-contact surfaces should not be forgotten (e.g., lightswitches, door handles, computer keyboards/mice). Enhanced disin-fection is important after contact with a suspected or con rmed in- fectious patient. Efforts will vary with the pathogen(s) suspected,including route of transmission, pathogenicity, persistence, and riskfor the practice 's patient population. For an examination room, this would include careful attention to cleaning all patient-contact surfaces FIGURE 4 Characteristics of selected disinfectants.ICPB Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 21(including floors as indicated), followed b y disinfec- tion (e.g., oxidizing agent) if more n arrow-spectrum disinfectants are used routinely. Because many of the pathogens involved in veterinary H A I sc a ns u r v i v ei nt h ee n v i r o n m e n tf o ra ne x t e n d e dp e r i o d ,l e a v i n gan area closed for several days is unlikely to prove bene cial. 31Instead, as indicated by the level of risk, a second round of disinfection may beadvisable. There is no evidence that appropriately chosen disinfectantsshould be routinely rotated to reduce the development of pathogenresistance. 32In all circumstances, protect involved staff by requiring the use of gloves and eye protection when splashes are likely (e.g., pouringor mixing disinfectants) and ensuring areas are well ventilated. PPE PPE should be considered a last line of defense for hazards thatcannot be overcome with other preventive measures. Nevertheless,given the inherent risk of exposure to pathogens in veterinarypractices, the proper use of PPE is a critical component of an ICPBprogram. The purpose is to reduce the risk of contamination ofclothing, reduce pathogen exposure to skin and mucous membranes of personnel, and reduce transmission of pathogens between patients by personnel. Common examples of PPE include lab coats, scrubs,gloves, gowns, eye protection, facemasks, and shoe covers. The typeof PPE used will vary with procedure and suspicion for an infectiousdisease and its route of transmission ( Table 14 ). Some form of PPE should be worn in all clinical situations, including any contact withanimals and their environment, and should not be worn outside ofthe work environment. Lab coats and scrubs should be laundered atleast daily or when contaminated (e.g., contact with an infectiouspatient). Gloves, gowns, and shoe covers should not be reused, evenwhen attending to the same patient. Correct removal of PPE iscritical to limit contamination of clothing and skin and mucousmembranes (Table 4). Gloved hands should not be used to contactsurfaces that will be touched by nongloved hands, with care taken toavoid contamination of personal items (e.g., telephones, pens).There is limited data on the effectiveness of footbaths and foot matsin infection control. 32,33Careful use of other approaches (e.g., shoe covers) is reasonable and may have fewer concerns (e.g., mainte-nance of disinfectant, spills). Areas for Special Consideration Disinfection of Physical Rehabilitation Equipment (Underwater Treadmill, Mats, Balls) Physical rehabilitation equipment poses a unique challenge for infection control, as items for this use are frequently dif cult to disinfect (e.g., foam construction, underwater treadmill withchemical-sensitive materials). Patients receiving physical rehabili-tation are often at increased risk for shedding or acquiring HAIpathogens (e.g., older with concurrent disease or skin infections,patients with fecal or urinary incontinence, surgical complicationsi n c l u d i n gS S I s ) .F u r t h e r ,s o m ep a t h o g e n sm a yb ef r e q u e n t l ye n -countered in rehabilitatio ne n v i r o n m e n t s( e . g . ,M D R Pseudomonas spp.), yet such environments are often overlooked as a source ofHAIs. 35,36Infection control, prevention, and biosecurity for a physical rehabilitation unit should focus on screening of patients, restrictingor adjusting use based on risk (e.g., con rmed/suspected infectious disease, recent history of diarrhea), regular cleaning and disinfectionof all equipment surfaces, monitoring and adjusting water chemistryfor water devices (e.g., appropriate chlorine levels will provide ad-equate disinfection for healthy patients), and educating the entirepractice team for proper technique and the use of PPE. SOPs uniqueto this environment (e.g., fecal accidents in water devices) shouldbe developed. 37 Animals Fed a Raw Meat Diet Raw meat diets have grown in popularity.38Pets fed raw foods are a unique source of HAI-associated pathogens in the hospital envi- ronment because they may shed organisms (often asymptomati- cally) that can cause illness in humans or other pets.39-41 Education of the client is of utmost importance with this pop-ulation of patients because risk avoidance starts in the home en- vironment with adequate cooking of raw ingredients before thepatient reaches the hospital. Patients fed raw meat products withinthe past 30 days likely pose the greatest risk and may warrantenhanced precautions such as use of PPE with or without isola-tion. Proper handling of feces an d surfaces contaminated by pa- tients fed raw animal diets (e.g., PPE, prompt cleaning anddisinfection) is critical. Multidrug-Resistant Organisms MDR organisms (e.g., extended spectrum b-lactamase-produci , Salmonella spp., Acinetobacter spp.,P s e u d o m o n a s spp.) have become increasingly problematic in veterinary medicine .These organisms can be passed directly or in directly between patients, the environment, and staff, resulting in infections that are challenging totreat. 6Close attention to hand hygiene, early identi cation of patients infected or colonized with these organisms, prompt removal of feces,environmental cleaning and disinfection, proper PPE, surveillance,antimicrobial stewardship, and education of clients and the practiceteam are the keys to minimizing HAIs by these bacteria. 6,42 Surgery Surgical site infections are an inherent risk in veterinary medicineand are complicated by the emergence of MDR organisms and the 22 JAAHA | 54:6 Nov/Dec 2018evolution of more invasive procedures and increasing frequency of immunocompromised patients.43Examples of risk factors for SSIs are the length and invasiveness of the procedure, perioperative hy-potension, the presence of MDR organisms on the patient or en-vironment, a \"clean \"versus \"dirty \"procedure, and the presence of an implant. 43In a recent study of veterinary SSIs, the majority of infections were caused by MRSP, an organism that is not controlledsolely by most patient pre- or postsurgical protocols or perioperativeprophylaxis with beta-lactam antimicrobials (e.g., cephalosporins). 43 HAIs in surgery can be controlled or prevented through attentionto environmental cleaning and disi nfection, patient preparation, proper surgical technique, simpli ed surgical suite design, PPE of surgeons and staff, the use of proper hand preparation techniques,appropriate (drug, dose, frequency) perioperative antimicrobialprophylaxis, and meticulous po managment. 6,44 Because of enhanced antibacterial ef cacy, rapid action, fewer side effects (e.g., do not cause skin abrasion), lower potential for re-sistance development, and time savings (generally 3 min rubtime), presurgical hand rubbing using alcohol-based formulations is now encouraged over traditional scrubs. 45 Dentistry The primary HAI considerations for a veterinary dentistry unit are the heightened risk of aerosolization of infectious particles; con-tamination of equipment such as wet tables, endotracheal tubes,and drills; and staff education on environmental cleaning anddisinfection and PPE. 46Aerosols (de ned as particles ,50mthat have the potential to remain airborne and penetrate the airwaysand lower lung passages of humans) can transmit pathogens, sa-liva, blood, and bacteria-laden debris. 46As pathogens frequently reside in the oral cavity of companion animals and aerosolizationof pathogens is possible, zoonotic transmission during veterinarydentistry is a concern. 7,47Pathogens of recent interest and rele- vance to veterinary dentistry, such as Pasteurella multocida and Staphylococcus spp., emphasize the importance of proper ICPB practices. Irrigating the oral cavity with a 0.12% chlorhexidinesolution before dental scaling has been recommended by some todecrease bacterial aerosolization. 48,49Dental procedures should be performed in a designated location distant from other procedures,patient housing, and staff so as not to potentiate HAIs via aero-solization. Proper face protection (e.g., goggles/face shield andface mask), gowns, and gloves should be used, and surfacescleaned and disinfected between patients. 7 Resuscitation Considerations for ICPB for cardiopulmonary resuscitation proce-dures are similar to what are proposed for dentistry. Aerosolizationand exposure to direct contact with pathogens are similar risk factorsfor HAIs and zoonotic transmission to the practice team. Envi-ronmental cleaning, separate areas for resuscitation (if possible) toavoid cross-contamination, and the use of PPE during resuscitationare critical, and can be easily overlooked during an emergency. 7The acute nature of resuscitation emphasizes the need for regular (e.g.,quarterly) \"practice runs \"in order to prepare the veterinary practice team to properly incorporate hand hygiene, PPE, and cleaning anddisinfection into resuscitation procedures. Immunocompromised Patients Immunocompromised patients include those receiving chemotherapyor other immunosuppressive agents and those with immune-alteringcomorbidities (e.g., cancer, asplenia), as well as very young and geriatric patients. Proper identi cation of these individuals is im- portant so that individualized procedures can be developed for each patient. When possible, the use of higher-risk procedures should beavoided (e.g., in-dwelling urinary catheters); when used, additionalattention should be placed on protocols that reduce HAI (e.g., Tables6, 7). In addition, hand hygiene and proper PPE should be strictlyenforced. 7 Obstetrics Zoonotic risks of exposure to Brucella canis ,C burnetii , and other infectious pathogens result from contact with birthing fluids of parturient animals, stillborn fetuses, and infected neonates.7Proper PPE includes gloves, waterproof gowns, and facial protection. Insome circumstances, respiratory tract protection is necessary (e.g.,when handling aborted fetuses likely to be infected with C burne- tii). 7It is helpful to know in advance what pathogens are common in a geographic area in order to take appropriate infection controlprecautions. Burn Care Although burn victims are relatively uncommon in veterinary medicine,they present special challenges because the patients in these cases areimmunocompromised and have wounds that require invasive tech-niques. Burns trigger a cascade of necrotic changes in tissue that aredirectly related to the cause of the injury and temperature of exposure. 50 Precautions for HAIs depend on the depth and severity of burn-resulting thermal injury. 50Infection control, p revention, and bio- security related to burns focus on wound control and exposure ofpatient and veterinary practice team members to potential MDRp a t h o g e n sa sw e l la so t h e rH A I s .A sa p p r o p r i a t e ,i s o l a t i o na n dw o u n dmanagement including cleaning of the burn site, use of onlysterile equipment, and careful attention to hand hygiene withproper PPE are critical for protecting these patients.ICPB Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 23Necropsy Necropsy presents several infection risks for veterinary personnel including personal injury while performing the procedure, exposureto zoonotic pathogens originating from the animal, and environ- mental contamination with pathogens. 7Eye protection, respiratory protection, and cut-proof gloves are necessary PPE for necropsy procedures (Table 9).7Necropsies should be performed in a location distant from the general hospitalized population and staff. However,if this is not possible, adherence to PPE, removing organic debris,and postprocedural cleaning and disinfection will help minimizeHAI risks. Environmental Procedures Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Consideration of proper heating, ventilation, and air conditioning iscritical for practice infection control. Appropriate ventilation isparticularly important for reducing airborne diseases, excessivemoisture and dust, and chemical fumes from disinfection productsthat make patients and staff susceptible to infection as a result ofdamaging their airways. Ventilation should not cause movement ofair from areas with known infected patients to other areas of thepractice. Spaces where infected patients are held should be vented tothe outside. The number of air exchanges per hour (the rate at whichthe complete volume of air inside a building or room is replaced withfresh outside air) is critical for good ventilation. Recommendationsvary between 5 and 8 air exchanges per hour. Whenever possible,three levels of air ltration are recommended in a practice: (1) a wire mesh to remove hair and large matter from the air; (2) a ner (less porous) lter placed within the air ducts to remove dust and other particulate matter; and (3) a high-ef ciency particulate air lter to remove viral particles and very ne particulate matter. High- efciency particulate air lters are expensive, and appropriate replacement of these lters may not be affordable for all prac- tices. Regardless of type, lters must be cleaned or changed frequently to prevent infectious buildup and hair-clogged vents.Ventilation systems need to be inspected regularly and updatedas needed. Rodent and Insect Vectors Some important veterinary pathogens can be transmitted by wildrodents or insect vectors (e.g., fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, flies). Pest management practices include examination of patients upon arrivalfor ectoparasites; immediate treatment of patients with fleas, ticks, or mites; and appropriate housing (e.g., isolation) until resolution. Drypet food and garbage should be stored in metal or thick plasticcontainers with pest-proof lids. Prompt disposal of food waste andother materials (e.g., feces) that may attract rodents or insects iscritical. Sealing potential pest points-of-entry, including mainte-nance of intact window screens, is important. Elimination of po-tential rodent nesting and mosquito breeding sites around thepractice (e.g., brush, debris, empty food bowls, clogged gutters)prevents onsite pest reproduction. Consultation with a pest controlexpert is recommended if a particular infestation is present, or foradditional guidance and information. Spills and Waste Veterinary biomedical waste is a potential source of zoonotic andnonzoonotic pathogens. In the United States, biomedical waste isdened and regulated at both state and municipal levels. 51Veterinary medical waste includes sharps, tissues (anatomic waste), highlycontaminated materials, and deceased animals. It is beyond the scope of these guidelines to describe spill clean- up and veterinary biomedical waste management in detail. However,basic guidelines are summarized here. Used sharps are consideredbiomedical waste and should be disposed of in accordance withregulations from municipal and state authorities. Use approved, puncture-resistant sharps disposal containers to remove, store, and dispose of needles and other items capable of causing punctures.Ensure such containers are readily available and used everywheresharps are handled to prevent sharps injuries to staff and clients.Nonanatomical waste saturated with blood, such as blood-soaked lapsponges and gauze, or materials used to clean up a spill of blood orinfectious secretions, are also disposed of as biomedical waste.Liquid waste such as drained thoracic fluid, abdominal fluid, ir- rigated solutions, excretions, and secretions may usually be pouredcarefully down a toilet or drain connected to a sanitary sewer ors e p t i ct a n k .L o c a l ,s t a t e ,a n df e d e r a lr e g u l a t i o n sm a yd i c t a t emaximum volume of blood or body fluids permitted to be poured into the sanitary sewer. If the fluid is likely to splash or spray during disposal, appropriate PPE should be worn. Waste should be con-tained in a leak-proof container or bag discarded with the waste(plastic garbage bag). Urine and feces are not biomedical waste, noris disposable equipment that has come in contact with an infectiousanimal (e.g., examination gloves, gowns, bandage materials notsaturated with blood). Potentially infectious, contaminated materials may pose a risk to practice personnel, patients, and waste disposal personnel. Precau-tions should be taken to minimize contamination of the practiceenvironment and the risk to people and animals from potentiallyinfectious waste. These include double-bagging of materials fromisolation areas. If the inside of a waste container becomes con-taminated, the container should be thoroughly cleaned and dis-infected after emptying. All waste from an isolation room should betreated as potentially infectious; trash from these areas should be 24 JAAHA | 54:6 Nov/Dec 2018removed by appropriately gloved and gowned personnel. Contam- inated articles should be either discarded or taken for additionalcleaning and disinfection. Rural practices, where biomedical wastedisposal services may not be available, may be able to make ar-rangements with a local human hospital or other medical facility tohave waste disposed of with human hospital waste. Laundry Single-use, disposable items are ideal for infection control, but theirdisposal produces tremendous waste and an environmental burden.Laundering reusable bedding, gowns, scrubs, towels, and other itemsis therefore an important component of infectious disease control.Linens and professional garb can serve as fomites, transportingpathogens within the practice and outside the practice into thecommunity. Microbe populations on soiled laundry are signi cantly reduced by dilution and further by the mechanical action of washing.Hot air drying further eliminates microorganisms. As transport toindividuals 'homes or other facilities increases ICPB risks, pro- fessional garb (e.g., scrubs, lab coats) should be washed onsite or by a specialized commercial laundry facility equipped to clean medical laundry. Practices should have appropriate laundry fa-cilities or laundry services to accommodate cleaning of theseitems daily or more frequently if necessary. To reduce contami-nation with infectious organism s and health risks to staff, ap- propriate PPE (i.e., gloves and dedicated laboratory coat) shouldbe worn by those performing laundry duties. Linens with grosscontamination should be assessed to determine if they can beeffectively cleaned. If not, they should be properly discarded.Otherwise, gross organic material should be removed prior towashing. Additional precautions should be taken for laundry from iso- lation rooms and infected animals. These items should be washedand processed separately from other practice laundry while wearingappropriate PPE to prevent spread of microbes. Items from infectedanimals should be presoaked in diluted bleach (9 parts water:1 parthousehold bleach) for 10 min to disinfect prior to machine washing.Isolation-room laundry should be washed in hot water with bleach,per manufacturer 's instructions. After bleaching and washing, laundry should be completely dried in a separate load from anyother laundry and returned to isolation. Appropriate Antimicrobial Stewardship The concept of antimicrobial stewardship, or the judicious use ofantimicrobials, including when not to use these agents, has emergedin the last decade as a necessary approach across health professions toprevent adverse events and selection for drug-resistant infectiouspathogens. The misuse of antimicrobials in human and veterinaryhealthcare is one of the key factors leading to the current epidemic ofantimicrobial resistance. More information on the overall concept ofantimicrobial stewardship and how it is applied in veterinary practiceas advised by the American Veterinary Medical Association canbe found at avma.org/KB/Resources/Reports/Pages/Antimicrobial-Stewardship-in-Companion-Animal-Practice.aspx. Previously cre-ated American Association of Feline Practitioners-AAHA guidelinesdiscuss the judicial therapeutic use of antimicrobials (aaha.org/public_documents/professional/guidelines/aafp_aaha_antimicro-bialguidelines.pdf). Information on more longstanding antimicro-bial stewardship practices in human hospitals and long-term carefacilities in the United States, referenced in the American VeterinaryMedical Association document, can be found at cdc.gov/getsmart/healthcare/implementation/core-elements.html. Personnel Vaccination Although not always nancially viable for all hospitals or staff within a hospital, personnel vaccination is an important compo-nent of occupational health and safety. Decisions regarding vac- cination of staff should consider the risk of exposure, the severity of disease, whether the disease is treatable, the transmissibility ofdisease, and the quality and safety of the vaccine. It is recommendedthat all veterinary personnel who might have contact with animalsshould be vaccinated against rabies, except in areas that have beenformally declared rabies-free (e.g., Hawaii). 7This includes lay staff that might have periodic animal contact, such as receptionists.Rabies vaccines for humans are generally considered safe andhighly effective. For additional information on human rabiesvaccination, see the CDC rabies website (cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/preexposure.html). Other vaccinations including tetanus and annual in fluenza may be appropriate depending on the practice setting and other exposurerisks. Additional information is available. 7 Education, Training, and Compliance Education and training of the practice team is an integral part to anysuccessful ICPB program. Numerous studies have demonstrateddecreases in HAIs after some form of educational or training pro-gram was completed. 52-55A comprehensive training program should include education on basic principles of ICPB, departmental speci c protocols, strategies to develop critical and independent thinking tohelp team members in unexpected patient care situations, and anevaluation of staff compliance through surveillance, testing, andauditing. 56 The effectiveness of an ICPB program is dependent on not only appropriate training of the practice team, but on the extent to whichinfection control protocols are accepted by the practice team asICPB Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 25necessary and useful.57,58Therefore, it is critical that prior to starting the formal education program, the practice team is committed to and passionate about infection control. One strategy to accomplishthis is a hospital-wide meeting (or a small-group meeting if trainingnew employees) in which the ICP discusses recent hospital or localdisease outbreaks, documented increases in HAIs, or presents cur-rent ICPB de ciencies at the practice (e.g., observations of hand hygiene compliance, environmental cleaning de ciencies identi ed with fluorescent tagging; see the \"Implementing an Infection Con- trol Program \"section). The ICP should use data uncovered during an assessment/audit of the practice facility to guide this discussion(Table 10). The formal education program should begin with training all practice team members on the basic principles of ICPB. Topics tocover include modes of transmission of pathogens (discussed earlierin these guidelines), common pathogens that may be encountered inthe practice setting, and a demonstration of appropriate hand hy-giene and PPE use. Cleaning and disinfection protocols should becovered at this time as well. This training can take the form of an in- person meeting, required reading/online training, or both, depending on the practice setting. After teaching basic ICPB principles, focused education on departmental-speci c protocols and situations should be covered. This is best accomplished by integrating infection control educationinto routine training on daily duties for the position, supplementedwith handouts and checklists covering speci c protocols. For ex- ample, during phone training for receptionists, there should bediscussion of recognizing cases that may present an infection controlconcern, phone scripts to identify high-risk patients, demonstratingappointment scheduling for a suspected infectious patient, andlearning arrival instructions for patients with infectious disease. Theteam member being trained should be given written material toreference and shown where to easily access any scripts or checklistswithin the practice. However, even the most extensive training cannot prepare practice team members for all the possible infection control scenariosthey might encounter. Although having protocols for the mostcommon situations is helpful, practice team members must alsodevelop a level of critical and independent thinking about infectioncontrol so that they can make sound clinical decisions when en-countering a more complex or unexpected situation. Simulations ofthese situations has been theorized to improve outcomes in thehuman medical eld. 58,59Although the resources of a typical vet- erinary practice do not allow for the often-extensive simulatedtraining that occurs in human hospitals, simulating infection con-trol scenarios in the practice setting can be an invaluable tool. TheICP 's creativity is a key factor in the infection control component ofthe training program, and this type of training can be accomplishedwithout excessive time or expense. The use of fluorescent tagging or simulated patients (stuffed animals or staff pets) can be helpful instaging a mock infection outbreak. Infection control drills can bestaged during downtime in the practice. Receptionists can receive acall from a mock client that challenges their history-taking anddecision-making process. A method for evaluating compliance with the practice 's training program is needed to ensure the training has been successful, anda formal performance feedback program can also further im-prove outcomes. 53Written testing of basic ICPB knowledge and departmental-speci c protocols should be performed at the end of each training period and periodically thereafter to assess retention ofknowledge. Routine surveillance data should be used to monitor forany breaches or noncompliance with the ICPB program. Regularreporting of this data can provide feedback to staff members.Simulated, real-world scenarios can also be useful in assessing thepractice team 's knowledge of infection control and can be used to monitor compliance with the program. These tools for evaluating and assessing compliance should be applied in a positive, nonpu- nitive way to help motivate staff to consistently and effectively im-plement the practice 's program and appreciate the importance of each person 's actions in HAI prevention and overall ICPB success. Client Education Although veterinary staff work to prevent the spread of pathogensand disease within their facilities, it is imperative that clients are alsosufciently educated regarding the key role they have in ICPB in the community and their home environment. Educating clients on theimportance of regular visits to their veterinarian and appropriatepreventive measures, such as vaccination, endo- and ectoparasitecontrol, and good overall health of their pets, is the best way toprevent the spread of disease. In addition to general infectious disease education, clients should be informed on zoonotic risks relevant to their pets, them-selves, and family members. Key pathogens to highlight for clientsinclude but are not limited to common endoparasites (e.g., spp. 60Some diseases, although not transmitted directly from the pet to humans, still demand appro-priate control methods such as avoiding exposure to vector-bornediseases via shared contact with the pet or its environment. Forexample, fleas are easily transferred between animals and humans. Environmental or on-animal infestations, particularly in homeswith young children, carry a risk of zoonosis for flea-borne diseases, such as Bartonella infection. Although there is not a direct zoonotic 26 JAAHA | 54:6 Nov/Dec 2018risk from ticks attached to a pet, they should be disposed of carefully when removed, and owners of these pets should take caution ofsimilar risks to themselves and others in the household due to en-countering ticks in the same environments as their pet. 61 It is possible to reduce the spread of zoonotic diseases with appropriate preventive care including routine veterinary visits forannual exams, vaccinations, overall health assessment, as well as flea and tick control as indicated by their area. Fecal exams for detectionof intestinal parasites should be performed as indicated by the patientage, geographical location, and parasite exposure risk. Further owner considerations in preventing zoonotic diseases include the practice of good personal hygiene, particularly handhygiene after handling pets; handling pet food and treats, especiallywhen it includes an uncooked meat product; and always beforeeating. Litter boxes, pet dishes, pet beds, and toys should be keptclean. Cat litter boxes should be cleaned regularly (daily if higher-risk persons are in the household). In the case of households withdogs, cleaning up pet feces should be done regularly (e.g., at leastweekly) to reduce environmental contamination with pathogens. Feces should be disposed of in a waste receptacle, not in recyclable waste or compost. Additional pet \"messes \"( v o m i t u s ,s t o o l ,a n d urine) should be cleaned up, disposed of accordingly, and surfacesdisinfected. Hands should be thoroughly washed afterward; glovescan be used to provide an extra level of protection. Pets shouldbe fed a high-quality diet, avoiding raw or undercooked diets.Hunting for food sources, including garbage or table scraps,should also be discouraged. Additional pet behaviors that can poseincreased zoonotic disease risks and should be discouraged aredrinking from the toilet, eating feces (own or of other animals),and drinking standing water. Pets should not be permitted to have contact with wild animals. Owners of pets likely to have contact with wild animals (e.g., pre-dominately outdoor, hunting) should be informed of these increasedrisks and, when possible, preventive measures taken to reduce pet andowner health risks (e.g., endo- or ectoparasite prevention, rabiesvaccination, preventing consumption of wildlife). Potentially con-taminated environments or situations in which exposure risks areunknown, including interactions with animals with unknown vac-cination or parasite status, should be avoided. Additional suggestionsfor prevention of infection include regular pet grooming and bathing,maintaining short nails to prevent scratches, and spaying andneutering to prevent roaming, which can increase risk of diseaseexposure and transmission. 60 Immunocompromised people have an increased risk of ac- quiring zoonotic diseases, including those transmitted by pets. Thoseindividuals who ,5o r.65 yr HIV-infection; chemotherapy,organ transplantation, or treatment for autoimmune diseases; orhave other conditions for which their physician has indicated thatthey are at an increased risk for infections should take greatercaution. 62Immunocompromised clients should be advised of modi able behaviors that reduce their risk for pet-associated in- fections, with particular emphasis on always performing hand hy-giene after pet contact, discouraging pets from face-licking, and nothaving contact with pet feces (i.e., ideally have an immunocompe-tent household member perform this duty). Regular cleaning anddisinfection of cages, food areas, bedding, and toys should be per-formed by an immunocompetent individual who observes stricthand hygiene. Immunocompromised people should avoid contactwith amphibians, reptiles, rodents, exotic animals, strays, younganimals, and any animal suspected to be infectious (e.g., with acutevomiting, diarrhea, skin disease), as well as items that have been incontact with these animals. A key to infection control success in the household and com- munity is client compliance with risk reduction strategies. Thisrequires active involvement and cooperation of the clinical team and the client. Clients should be provided with handouts in addition to face-to-face counseling on prevalent local infectious diseases ofimportance. Pet owners can also be directed to online resources suchas the Companion Animal Parasite Council (capcvet.org/capc-recommendations), the CDC' s Healthy Pets Healthy People (cdc. gov/healthypets), Worms and Germs Blog 's resources for pets (wormsandgermsblog.com), the DVM360 's handout on parasites (veterinarybusiness.dvm360.com/forms-parasitology-handouts), andaaha.org/biosecurity. Summary Without effective ICPB practices implemented in the primary careand referral settings, the clinician 's efforts at disease prevention and treatment are compromised and, in some cases, nulli ed. Because many pathogens in the hospital environment have zoonotic potential, barriers to human exposure to animalpathogens in a clinical setting also serve to safeguard publichealth. Taken together, the consequences of ICPB have profoundimplications for clinical practice and should be of high priority.Stated another way, the veterinarian 's best efforts can be negated if faulty ICPB results in exposure of the staff or patient to in-fectious pathogens. The methodology of ICPB is largely procedural, meaning that it is based on protocols and SOPs that apply to the entire healthcareteam. To adapt to changing circumstances at the local level, includingstaff turnover, these processes should be regularly revisited, followedby revision as needed, with refresher trainings for the entirehealthcare team. Patient and staff flow, hand hygiene, cleaning andICPB Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 27disinfection, and PPE serve as the foundation for ICPB practices and should be addressed in all practice programs. Effective ICPB is based on control methods that form a hier- archy of effectiveness. Prevention (elimination) of microbial con-tamination by removal or denying access to general patient areas ofthe premises by high-risk patients (i.e., those considered likely to beinfectious) is the most effective method of ICPB control, followed indeclining order of ef cacy by hospital design to mitigate exposure, administrative controls, and use of PPE. Various situations in clinical practice require different ap- proaches to ICPB to avoid contaminating the premises or expos-ing the patient or staff to opportunistic infectious agents. Thesespecialized circumstances include surgery, dentistry, resuscitation,management of immunocompromised patients, admission of pa-tients with infectious disease, obstetrics, burn care, rehabilitationareas, and handling of postmortem tissues and patients, includingnecropsy. In such cases, exposure to pathogens may be increasedbecause of the nature of the procedure, through the generation ofaerosols, direct contact with infected tissues, and contact with fomites. Additionally, surgical or trauma sites may place patients at increased risk of exposure to microbes. In many veterinary practices, the clinical staff may not be formally trained in ICPB, and the various ICPB protocols may seemdaunting to implement. However, these factors should not deterveterinarians from implementing a comprehensive ICPB program.Rather, the process of developing and systematically employingICPB protocols can be done incrementally, building on andstrengthening ICPB methods already in use. Improvements in apractice 's compliance with ICPB practices and reductions in re- lated risks, ideally catalogued by the ICP dedicated to monitoringprogram success, will reinforce the tangible value of ICPB observedby the healthcare team. Managing ICPB requires focus and dedi-cation of the entire staff, including education, training, andmonitoring of the entire healthcare team to ensure comprehen-sion, pro ciency, and compliance with best practices. These efforts are enabled by the use of situation-speci c protocols and proce- dures for ICPB, and by client education to inform pet owners ofthe importance of home care to avoid exposure of the patient andowner to infectious pathogens. With the increasing complexity of care including the use of oncolytic agents, surgical implants, and the increase of MDR or-ganisms, it is now paramount that the modern veterinary practicedevelop infection prevention and control protocols. For thosepractices with few or no infection control protocols, they should beheartened and encouraged to take small steps. As ICPB steps be-come prioritized, veterinary practice owners and employees willrealize additional direct health bene ts to patients, staff, and clientsas well as indirect nancial, social, and environmental positive impacts.
