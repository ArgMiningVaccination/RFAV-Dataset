For hair loss due to heredity, age, and hormones, the topical medication Rogaine (minoxidil) has been used for both male and female pattern baldness. Expect to wait 6 months before you see results. The oral medication Propecia (finasteride) is effective in some men. This medicine can decrease sex drive. When either medication is stopped, the former baldness pattern returns. Hair transplants performed by a physician are a surgical approach to transferring growing hair from one part of the head to another. It is somewhat painful and expensive, but usually permanent. Hair weaves, hair pieces, or changes of hair style may disguise hair loss. This is generally the least expensive and safest approach to hair loss. Hair pieces should not be sutured to the scalp because of the risk of scars and infection. The naturopathic approach to hair loss involves identifying the cause of hair loss from a holistic and a scientific perspective using various [medical tests](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/medical-testing/toronto-medical-testing-centre.html).

Our approach is to identify the root cause of your hair loss issues and treat it naturallly. The assessment will include a comprehensive initial naturopathic consultation followed by appropriate laboratory testing for hormonal imbalances,, nutritional defiiciences and any testing that may be required to identify what is causing the hair loss, identify what type of hair disorder you may have and reveal any underlying diseases. A physical exam will be performed as well. In the case of hirsutism and alopecia, hormone testing will be recommended. The assessment is oriented toward determining what is impeding your body's ability to function normally. Most of our services and testing is covered by extended health insurance plans.

A diet that contains whole foods, particularly the outer skin of plants such as potatoes, cucumbers, green and red peppers, and sprouts can give strength to hair because they are rich in the mineral silica. Foods that are high in iron, such as lean meats, are important for people with a known iron deficiency.Physical Medicine Stress reduction techniques can increase blood flow to the scalp.Massage Therapeutic massage increases circulation and reduces stress. Scalp massage using essential oils of rosemary, lavender, sage, thyme, and cedar wood may be helpful in increasing circulation. Add 3 to 6 drops of essential oil to 1 tbsp. of jojoba or grapeseed oil. Massage into scalp daily.Ayurveda Bhringaraj oil or brahmi oil are applied to the scalp regularly to stimulate hair growth. The Ayurvedic herbs ashwagandha and amla are also reported to stimulate hair growth.Traditional Chinese Medicine In traditional Chinese medicine, hair loss and premature greying is linked to kidney deficiency syndrome. Other symptoms of kidney deficiency are weakness and fatigue and low back weakness. Kidney energy is believed to naturally decline with age, but people with early or accelerated hair loss may have particularly weak kidney energy. Kidney tonics or acupuncture is usually recommended.Prevention Some forms of hair loss can be prevented by minimizing stress, eating a healthy diet and using sensible hairdressing techniques, and, if possible, switching to medications that do not cause hair loss. Hair loss from fungal infections can be prevented by keeping hair clean and by never sharing hats, combs or brushes with other people. Hair loss from hereditary-pattern baldness can sometimes be prevented by medication. * DISCLAIMER: The information on this article is the property of Dr. Sushma Shah, Naturopathic Doctor, and is not intended to treat, diagnose or cure any diseases or promote any services or products mentioned on the website.
