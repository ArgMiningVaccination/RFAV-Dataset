Addressing the treatment and recovery needs in our communities, we opened doors to multiple locations to support tribal members on their recovery journey. We center culture, ceremony, language, and traditions at the heart of the recovery journey.

In November 2021, this dream was realized when we opened the doors to the Center for Wabanaki Healing & Recovery, a facility to support tribal members on their recovery journey. Those seeking healing will have the opportunity to re-establish healthy relationships with our culture and their wellness in Wabanaki homelands, where vulnerability is an opportunity to build strength. We work to heal our communities using traditional healing that allows for connecting with the land and culture. We are committed that wherever our people are in their healing journey, we have a place for them. "}
