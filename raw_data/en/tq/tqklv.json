They're easily available, or you can make them yourself at home. However, in either case, you should limit excessive juice consumption to avoid negative consequences, such as obesity and dental damage in children [(1)](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/soft-drinks-juice-and-sweet-drinks-children). This post discusses some nutritious juices and some delicious juice recipes for you to try. Are Juices Healthy For Children? Water is the best liquid to keep kids hydrated. Juices are a lovely treat in appropriate portions from time to time. But as a routine, it is better for children to eat whole fresh fruit and vegetables. Store-bought juices are available in different forms, like 100% juice, concentrated, and diluted juice. Out of these, moderate consumption of 100% fruit juice as part of a [healthy diet](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/nutritious-healthy-foods-for-kids-children_00654020/) may provide children with nutrients, without contributing to weight gain [(2)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26091353/). But many shop bought ones add extra sugar (or other ingredients) so it's important to check the label. Juices may be useful in the following ways. - Juices can work as a medium to encourage children to eat whole fruit and vegetables. - Moderate consumption of fruit juices can provide flavonoids that possess antioxidant properties with long term health benefits, such as improved cardiovascular health [(3)](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids) [(4)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314486111_Effects_and_Mechanisms_of_Fruit_and_Vegetable_Juices_on_Cardiovascular_Diseases). - Juices contain polyphenolsi [X]Naturally occurring antioxidant compounds found in food items such as fruits, vegetables, coffee, tea, and wine , oligosaccharidesi [X]Carbohydrates containing three to ten simple sugars and found in plant-based foods such as legumes, grains, and vegetables , and nitrates that may work as prebiotics good for gut health [(5)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28526852/). - Unsweetened homemade juices with fiber can be a better snack alternative to soda and other high-sugar beverages. But remember whole fresh fruits and vegetables are always a better choice. How Much Juice Can Children Have? According to the USDA, unsweetened 100% juices are a part of the fruit and vegetable group. Juice should contribute to half or less than half of the total recommended fruit and vegetable intake for the day [(6)](https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/nutrition-food-safety-health/sugar-and-sweeteners-9-301/). Below is the age-appropriate recommendation for fruit juice intake for children [(7)](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Fruit-Juice-and-Your-Childs-Diet.aspx).

These juices are called \"reconstituted 100% fruit juices.\" - Check the list of ingredients along with the nutritional information to know about the ingredients, along with the number of nutrients per serving. - Give preference to \"100% fruit and vegetable juice,\" which does not contain added sugar.
