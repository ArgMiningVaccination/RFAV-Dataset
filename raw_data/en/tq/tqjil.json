Mel Helmkamp, Clinic Coordinator indicated the vaccine for this year's flu season was recently received. In addition to having the vaccine available at the Health Department, several vaccine clinics are being planned for this fall out in the county. The new vaccine for RSV is also now available at the Health Department. The new RSV vaccine is for individuals ages 60 years and older. Adults at the highest risk for severe RSV includes older adults, adults with chronic heart or lung disease, adults with weakened immune systems, and adults living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. In his financial review, Bond County Health Department Administrator Sean Eifert indicated the overall agency's cash balance declined since the board's last meeting. The decline was attributed partially to two departments recording a loss for the month. With the State of Illinois' fiscal year beginning July 1, expected grant funds have also not yet been received. The Bond County Health Department was approved for the State of Illinois' SIPA grant, which provides funding of $350,000 to be used over 5-years for workforce development through the recruitment, training, and retention of employees. Board of Health members approved the fiscal budget for 2024 and it will now be forwarded to the Bond County Board for final approval. "}
