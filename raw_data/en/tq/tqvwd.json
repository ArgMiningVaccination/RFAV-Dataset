Watch this short video to learn more about OLogy. Welcome to Ology. You are on the free kids science website from the American Museum of Natural History. This site is for students of all ages and for the adults who teach them. Have you ever wondered what T. Rex ate for lunch or how astronomers figure out the distance to faraway stars? On Ology, you can find out. Just click here in the menu to explore Ology by type of activity, play games, read stories, do hands-on activities, and watch videos-- all developed by museum educators with help from some of the world's leading scientists. There is lots to do here with 14 different branches of science that you can browse. There is a section where educators can find activities for specific grade levels. And the free Ology app can be downloaded and used offline. We offer hundreds of unique, free resources. You might want to build webs of life under the sea, explore the different ways ancient Greeks used poison, or you might want to go on a virtual birding expedition with Theodore Roosevelt. So dive in. Explore. And we hope you'll come back often. Below is a sample of resources at all K-8 grade levels that support classroom learning. For more K-12 learning resources visit [Resources for Learning](/learn-teach/resources-for-learning).

[Map Your World](/explore/ology/archaeology/map-your-world2) Students can follow these easy steps to develop a model (drawing) of their room and the things in it. Then they can broaden the drawing to include their entire floor, apartment, or house. [Grow Rock Candy](/explore/ology/earth/grow-rock-candy2) Students can carry out an investigation using sugar and water to determine whether heating or cooling a substance may cause changes that can be observed. This activity reinforces the ideas that the properties of materials can change when heated and that sometimes those changes may not be reversible. [Keeping a Field Journal](https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/genetics/keeping-a-field-journal) This simple tool can help students plan and carry out investigations of wildlife in their area. (Note: this activity can be accomplished from indoors looking out a window.) GRADE 3 [What's This? Staying Safe](/explore/ology/biodiversity/whats-this-staying-safe) One of the keys to survival is staying safe. Discover some of the amazing ways that organisms keep from being eaten. [What Makes You, YOU?](/explore/ology/genetics/what-makes-you-you2) In this short animated video students zoom inside their cells for a fascinating look at chromosomes, DNA, genes, and more. The video provides a clear and basic explanation of how offspring inherit traits from parents. [What's This? Life at the Limits](/explore/ology/zoology/whats-this-life-at-the-limits) In this interactive article, students can discover some of the remarkable ways that species have evolved to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. In many cases, cause and effect relationships are identified and used to explain adaptations. [Living Large](/explore/ology/paleontology/living-large2) This engaging game about dinosaurs allows students to analyze and interpret fossil data, as well as engage in argument from evidence. The game helps students to understand that fossils provide evidence about the types of organisms that lived long ago and the nature of their environments. [Crazy Camouflage](https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/marine-biology/crazy-camouflage2) Create a flounder fish that's hard to spot! In this hands-on activity, students gather evidence to explore how camouflage helps animals survive.

[Plates on the Move](/explore/ology/earth/plates-on-the-move2) Volcanic eruptions, massive tsunamis, powerful earthquakes... students can examine how plate tectonics affect our world. By watching animations, reading stories, and answering questions, students analyze and interpret data to find patterns among Earth's features. [All About Jade](/explore/ology/earth/all-about-jade) What makes the prized rock called jade so special that people have used it for so long, and in so many different ways? By responding to questions in an interactive quiz, students can communicate their knowledge of planet Earth, its features, and changes that occur through several natural processes.
