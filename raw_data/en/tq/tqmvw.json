Under both, all employees are required to have at least a first dose of vaccine by November 30. Those who are partially vaccinated may be subject to other health and safety measures, including testing. Those who do not have a first dose by November 30 will face employment consequences, including unpaid leave. \"We believe that people who work in these sectors must be vaccinated to protect the people they care for,\" said Premier Tim Houston. \"Protecting vulnerable Nova Scotians is the most important thing. We will deal with potential impacts to services and staffing levels that may result from people choosing to leave, rather than get a life-saving vaccine. If you haven't been vaccinated yet, it's not too late.
