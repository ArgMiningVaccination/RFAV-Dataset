By breaking through these energetic blocks, the body's inherent ability to heal itself is stimulated. That definition is a lot to process, so here are five facts that can clear up any confusion or misconceptions you may still have about energy healing: Advertisement 1. We've been studying the body's energy centers for thousands of years. Reiki is the Japanese tradition of energy healing, and it dates back to the early 20th century. [The seven chakras](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/7-chakras-for-beginners), the energy transmission centers of the body, were first described in ancient Hindu texts. Meridians, the energy superhighways of the body, helped lead traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to develop acupuncture. These ancient cultures used different modalities to stimulate the body's natural ability to heal, but they all recognized the power of internal energy. 2. Energy healing is based on scientific principles. We all learned in high school physics class that matter is made up of molecules. Even something that is solid, such as a table, is vibrating all the time. As humans, we, too, are vibrating. When you say someone has \"good vibes,\" you are really talking about that person's vibrational energy\u2014and happy people tend to [vibrate on a higher frequency](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/ways-to-raise-positive-vibrations). Places have vibes too. When you walk into a room in which a fight has just occurred, you may feel a dense energy that makes you want to leave right away. The beach has a light vibe due to the salt ( [a natural energy cleanser](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/herbs-to-clear-negative-energy)) and moving air. The air at the beach vibrates at a higher frequency as well. Advertisement Energy healing is a complementary modality that shouldn't exclude any Western medicine you may be taking. 3. Anyone can benefit from energy healing. Just as you don't need to understand the law of gravity before you can fall down, you don't need to completely grasp the concept of energy healing before you dive into the practice. Any time is a good time to visit an energy healer. I would recommend going in with an open mind for maximum benefit. If you are [stressed](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/natural-remedies-for-stress), [anxious](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-people-cope-with-anxiety), or physically drained, an energy healing session can help you relax and feel more balanced. And if you're already feeling good, it's always possible to feel a little better. It's important to note that energy healing is a complementary modality that shouldn't exclude any Western medicine you may be taking. 4. There are many types of accessible energy healing modalities.
