ACBS Staff Appreciation Awards On October 26, 2020 ACBS held a virtual award ceremony and presented several ACBS staff members for their above and beyond efforts during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Shardai Bonnas & Constance (Connie) Carter Developing educational resources for the ACBS Microbiology Program Samantha Biffar Assisting with the management of the Al-Marah Equine Center Program Jasmine Millabas Maintaining the safety and quality of the Aquaculture Pathology LaboratoryRichard Park & Libin Zhu Maintaining the safety and quality of the research in Dr. Ravishankar's Food Safety Laboratory Rylee Rocca Assisting the ACBS' Business Office Deborah Reed Assisting with the extension activities and ACBS' newsletter during the COVID Aurora Plascencia Class scheduling and assistance with various academic program activities3 The University of ArizonaIntroduction to Animal Sciences Lab Making a hands-on course interactive, even when it's virtual. How can you teach \"hands-on\" laboratories in a virtual environment? Six ACBS instructors were given that challenge when Covid-19 forced ACBS 102L (Introduction to Animal Sciences Laboratory) to be taught online. Designed to expose students to various production practices and procedures in the animal industry, Crista Coppola (course coordinator), and her colleagues, Sam Garcia, Will Milashoski, Amber Hubbell, Netzin Steklis, and H. Dieter Steklis, employed creative solutions for teaching their \"hands-on\" lab sections in a \"hands-off\" remote modality. Netzin and Dieter Steklis provided some insight into how they overcame the challenges they faced with converting their lab sections to virtual. Equine Lab For Netzin Steklis, who teaches the Equine Lab #1 and #2 of this course, adapting her lab to the \"remote\" teaching modality was a challenge. While part 1 lent itself quite well to the transition, part 2 was previously held at Al-Marah Equine Center where students could observe the horses and interact with the facility manager. Working with her creative and dedicated university colleagues, Netzin was able to develop a 'remote lab' by using videos of the Al-Marah Equine Center horses and interviews with the manager. Through peer-to-peer collaboration via Zoom, students learned about horse domestication, gained an understanding of the importance of the Al-Marah Arabian horse and how it compares to other equine athletes such as the Thoroughbred horse, and were able to evaluate the Equine Center's animal welfare practices. Video lectures created at the Al-Marah Equine Center helped students gain a better understanding of the differences between horse breeds. Vet Science Lab The focus of the Veterinary Science Lab, taught by Dieter Steklis, was for students to learn about the evolution and development of the mammalian circulatory system and to understand differences in mammalian heart function. Normally, this lab would give students the opportunity to examine and dissect cardiovascular tissue as a vital hands-on experience. For the virtual format, students instead watched several recorded lecture segments on the evolution, development, and adaptive function of the cardiovascular system, followed by a video demonstration of the instructor dissecting a sheep heart. The dissection video tied together the details presented in the previous lectures, to help students connect the anatomical concepts and terminology. The heart dissection video also showed a demonstration of basic suture technique. As homework, students were asked to gather the necessary materials for suturing and to practice this basic suture technique, either on chicken skin, or banana skin which is similar to animal skin in texture. Based on student feedback, the majority of students particularly enjoyed the suturing practice. Students in the vet Sci Lab practiced a basic suture technique on either chicken or banana skin. (Continued from 1) Food Safety Conference the poster sessions and to the judging team, Vicki Scott of the Yuma Fresh Produce Council, Jeremy Vanderzyl of Duncan Family Farms, Dr. Dan Engeljohn, Tedley Pihl, and Dr. Duane Wulf. The goal of the Food Safety Consortium (FSC) is to address food safety issues in Arizona using a multidisciplinary collaborative approach. The FSC consists of members from across the University of Arizona, as well as, the Arizona Department of Agriculture, State Health Agencies, and the food safety industry. Areas of research range from fundamental aspects of microbiology, to field-based applications that directly affect the safety of the food supply. The group also connects extension agents out in the counties to the research teams as an integral part of the information pipeline.

Corrie is excited to be a part of the UArizona and being able to support scientific endeavors that prepare the world for the future challenges ahead.Dr. Chi Zhou Assistant Professor Dr. Zhou's lab focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying the fetal sex-specific dysregulation of fetal endothelial function in complicated pregnancies-associated fetal endothelial dysfunction and future health risks of the offspring. Her research utilizes multiple model systems including human tissues, human cell models, and in vivo animal models. Endothelial cells are a thin single layer of cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. Dysregulation of endothelial cell function is associated with many cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Children born to complicated pregnancies (such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes) have increased risks of adult-onset cardiovascular disorders later in life, suggesting there is programming of fetal vascular/endothelial systems before birth. Dr. Zhou was born in Jiujiang, China, a city with more than 2,000 years of history, located right next to the Mount Lushan UNESCO Global Geopark. She obtained her PhD degree from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, where she learned how to ski and regularly visited the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Her PhD research focused on 1) defining the \"normal\" transcriptomic profile of early porcine embryos, and 2) characterizing the impact of in-vitro manipulations on embryonic quality and the potential pregnancy outcomes. After completing her PhD, Dr. Zhou, joined the Perinatal Research Lab, Department of Ob/Gyn, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as a postdoctoral fellow, and later as an Assistant Scientist (Research Assistant Professor). Her research focused on fetoplacental vascular growth and development, particularly those relevant to pregnancy complications. At UArizona, Dr. Zhou's research aims to reveal the mechanisms controlling the complicated pregnancy-induced fetal sex-specific endothelial dysfunction in female and male fetal endothelial cells. Specifically, she is interested in 1) studying the sexual dimorphisms of complicated pregnancies-associated fetal endothelial dysfunction, 2) exploring the role of microRNAs in complicated pregnancies-induced fetal endothelial dysfunction, and 3) examining the effect of maternal obesity on fetal endothelial function and future cardiovascular risks of the offspring. Results from these studies will contribute to the identification of novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets for adult-onset cardiovascular disease in children born to complicated pregnancies. About coming to the UArizona she says \"I am amazed by the highly collaborative, multidisciplinary, and supportive research environment, as well as the infrastructure and institutional resources available to students, educators, and researchers at the University of Arizona. I am very excited to join this great community. Also, after living in the north for 12 years, I am very much looking forward to the warm winters in Tucson.\" 5 The University of ArizonaRTIP Director, Wendy Davis, Retires After 30 Years of Service As the workhorse and backbone of the University of Arizona Race Track Industry Program (RTIP) for 30 years, many of Wendy Davis' achievements are best demonstrated through the success of the students who have passed through the program and went on to excel in prominent national and international positions in the racing industry. She was integral in bringing in the cream of the crop professionals from all aspects of the racing industry to guest lecture and interact one-on-one with students right here at the University of Arizona. Her talent at making the right connections between students and industry members to facilitate internships, often led to permanent job offers. In the early 90's, Wendy brought to fruition a student suggestion to create a lunch event that allowed one-on-one interaction with the top trainers, racetrack CEOs, and award winning announcers at the annual RTIP Symposium. Graduates have often described the Mentor Lunch, as it came to be called, as a defining moment in the beginning of their careers. Wendy continuously demonstrated a commitment to service on College and University committees, including the CALS Scholarship and the Undergraduate Council. She worked tirelessly to ensure that ACBS curriculum, particularly the Animal Science major, prepared students to enter the industry with the skills needed to succeed, and served as academic advisor for the RTIP students. She had a long relationship with Mrs. Tankersley, known as Mrs. T, owner of Al-Marah Arabians and Jerry Hamilton, Al-Marah Farm Manager, having shown many of the Al-Marah horses at National and International Arabian championship shows. In fact, several of the World Champion trophies in the new Al-Marah trophy room (which she designed and created), were won by Wendy and Al-Marah horses. Finally, she went above and beyond during the transition of the Al-Marah property and Arabian horses to the University of Arizona animal science/equine program, including authoring the Arabian horse agreement terms with Mrs. T's son, (Mark) to arranging for multiple trailers to move the horse herd from the Campbell Farm to Al-Marah. Although COVID altered opportunities to celebrate Wendy's retirement as it should have been, several of her colleagues contributed to her retirement gift and shared their thoughts: \"You have been a mentor, ally and example of dedication to the students the entire time I have known you\" \"After 3 decades of unwavering and selfless commitment to the UA RTIP, you clearly made your mark and made the program what it is today.\" \"Your impacts and \"can do\" attitude and abilities will be missed greatly at the University of Arizona. Many won't know until things \"just don't happen\", since you saw what was needed and got it done.\" We wish Wendy the very best in retirement.Beloved and respected by faculty, staff, and students alike. Wendy Davis shows off her retirement gift, oil painting \"Mountain Cowboys\" by Heather Burton. Wendy presents Able Zander with the RTIP 2019 Distinguished Student award. Students presented their work directly to top industry members during the Annual RTIP Symposium.

As he learned more about the topic, he became determined to pursue a career in health care where he could help control and eradicate disease. To grow his knowledge of microorganisms and get him a step closer to his goal, he decided the UArizona was the perfect choice for obtaining his Bachelor of Science degree in Microbiology. The UArizona provided Cole with access to an amazing array of opportunities beyond course work including lab work, study abroad, clubs, courses, volunteer events, and more. One of the most beneficial options he took advantage of was working in Dr. Viswanathan's laboratory where he started at the end of his freshman year and worked up until graduation. Working in the lab helped to supplement in-course work with hands-on experience allowing him to become proficient in laboratory procedures. Dr. Vishwanathan has been an inspiration to Cole who says, \"I don't think my undergraduate experience at the UArizona would have been as impactful as it was if I hadn't worked for Dr. Vish, and I am truly grateful for all he has done for me.\" Cole has been fortunate to receive several scholarships from CALS Donors - the Margaret Bilson Microbiology Scholarship and the E. Ray Cowden Scholarship. In addition to the CALS scholarships, he received the Wildcat Excellence Scholarship and the Mayo Clinic Scholarship. All of these have helped alleviate the financial stress of attending university and allowed him to focus more on continuing his education. About his time at the UArizona, Cole says, \"The UArizona is truly an amazing place to receive an education and I am forever grateful for all of the experiences and opportunities that the university has provided me. I encourage any students still working on their undergrad to seek out new and enriching opportunities in whatever field they are excited and passionate about\". Cole will begin a Master of Public Health program in the Fall of 2021. Natasha Marie George P\u00e9rez Outstanding Senior | Veterinary Science Natasha \"Naty\" P\u00e9rez believes in the value of hard work and getting her hands dirty to make the world a better place. Helping animals has always been a passion and a calling for her. In fact, from the age of 5 she was watching surgery videos on spays/neuters, eye removals, and removal of limbs. She strives to help as many animals as she can and hopes to one day specialize in different techniques, like thermo x-rays to determine where an animal's pain is located, as well as create new techniques, medicines, and technology to better benefit animals. About her time at the UArizona, Naty says, \"What I enjoyed most about attending the University of Arizona, is the family that I have made within the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS). They helped me become a mentor, a Dean's Entrepreneurial Leadership Member, a student researcher, and so much more. They have helped me become who I am today, and helped me stay on the path of becoming a veterinarian. Though life can sometimes be rough, CALS was always the light at the end of the tunnel.\" Following completion of her BS in Veterinary Science, Naty will continue to work as a veterinary technician at a spay and neuter clinic and a general practice while she applies to DVM programs. Naty would like to thank her friends and family for their support and the invaluable mentorship provided by ACBS and the College of Veterinary Science faculty throughout her time at the UArizona. She goes on to thank Dean Burgess, \"As a previous veterinarian, he has provided insight into the field. He has made me more assured that this is my calling. He provided his assistance in helping me write my essays to veterinary school and not once gave up on me. Attending veterinary school would not only be an honor for me, but it would be an honor for Dean Burgess to see that his guidance has gotten me to where I need to be. I appreciate all that he has done for me.\" Natasha Marie George P\u00e9rez, ACBS Veterinary Science Outstanding Senior - Fall 2020 ACBS Associate Director of Academic Programs ACBS is pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. Scott Wilbur as the ACBS Associate Director for Academic Programs.

Youth and Adult 4-H Staff/Volunteers rose to the challenge of learning how to use online software to build their Creative Floating Farms during a two-week train-the-trainer workshop becoming STEM counselors. They then applied their AR knowledge by giving virtual demonstrations and leading zoom breakout rooms for AZ youth participants from several counties on Saturdays for 8 weeks. Participants learned how to use the free software which included Vuforia, TINKERCAD and Unity, to build their virtual 3D farm using their creativity. This experience helps to build confidence, critical thinking, collaboration, and team building skills which are essential for pursuing STEM careers and successfully completing higher education degrees. https://sites.google.com/email.arizona.edu/4-h-stem-youniversity-ar-float/home 4-H youth participant, Jonas Johnson of the Mighty Mountain 4-H Team in Greenlee County, displays is floating farm.Robotics 101 Virtual Camp The Fall 2020 Robotics 101 Virtual Camp was a great success with 106 youth participating statewide. We had three counties and one Federally Recognized Tribal Extension Program (FRTEP) represented including Santa Cruz with two teams, Yavapai with three teams, Maricopa with one team and the Hopi Tribe with one team. The 5-week robotics camp follows the CoderZ curriculum and teaches students the basics of coding and robotics. Each team is hosted by community youth and adult STEM Counselors who complete a two-week Train-the-Trainer course prior to the first day of camp. The program concluded with a closing ceremony and student recognition on December 18, 2020. This program was made possible by support from the AZ 4-H Youth Foundation, who provided the funding for the purchase of the CoderZ licenses, and the commitment and dedication of the planning team and community volunteers. Way to go Team! Team Talwiipiki, the Hopi 4H CoderZ Team, was led by 3 Student-Teachers and 1 Adult Project Leader. They had 7 Hopi students from several areas in the state join in and they had so much fun learning from each other. Their team name, Talwiipiki (Dal-wee-pik-y), means 'lightning' in the Hopi language, (it was the only form of electrical current our ancestors encountered a long time ago, so this is what we call electricity!). Team Discovery Coders, the Maricopa 4H CoderZ Team. Building the next generation of STEM Professionals Microbiology seniors (graduating May 2021), Cesily Cirerol, Sophia Quick and Rachel Whitman, as well as Biology junior, Amber Notah, conducted Cyclospora cayetanensis and Norovirus research in Dr. Gerardo (Jerry) Lopez's Food Safety and Environmental Microbiology Laboratory this past fall.
