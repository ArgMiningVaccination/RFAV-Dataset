Synergistically blended, our Energising Boost essential candle helps to encourage a positive energy, in creating this blend of essential oils I have used a few of my favourites to help to enhance your mood and increase alertness. My top three from this blend include: Grapefruit oil: A wonderfully zesty and fresh fragrance, whilst providing an uplifting effect, it also helps with stress and depression. White Thyme: This oil has been prized for thousands of years for its courage enhancing and spirit lifting proprieties - Used sparingly it's a wonder for the senses. Basil oil: Is a delight to use - it provides an endless optimistic atmosphere. For when I may need a little extra push of motivation, I will also use our energising boost candleto help inspire and lighten my mood after a long day at work.Our aromatherapy candle is poured by hand in our workshop amongst the sprawling lavender fields of the Norfolk coast.
