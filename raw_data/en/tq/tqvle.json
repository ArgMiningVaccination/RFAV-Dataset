It has broken newground in the UK by, for the first time, providing aframework for the control of herbal medicines in onepiece of legislation rather than the fragmented use ofregulations mostly deriving from the Medicines Act 1968.In the UK, the emphasis has been to have a regulatoryframework to control the safety and quality of herbalremedies which have been uncontrolled to date except forapproved medicines under the Medicines Act or thosewhich have had pharmacopoeia entries with appropriatestandardisation. The House of Lords Select Committee onComplementary and Alternative Medicine 2made strong recommendations in this area. It has been recognised thatthe evidence base for efficacy of herbals is variable and inmost cases is not able to meet the requirements of amodern medicine submitted for approval to the nationalregulator, the MHRA 3or to the EMEA. In the UK, it may well be that the memories of patients and their families are clearer than those of physicians. Itis less than 50 years ago that the majority of medicinesused in the UK were directly herbal or derived from herbal extracts. The trend at the end of the twentiethcentury was towards evidence-based medicine andanecdotal and historical evidence of patient benefit wasdecried. Many healthcare professionals recognise thatpatients do derive benefit from herbal preparations evenif the underpinning mechanisms are unknown and intruth, much of the benefit is symptomatic. However, if thepatient feels benefit,this improvement may well have long-term advantage in terms of quality of life. On the otherhand, mainland European culture has always had a greateracceptance of herbal medicine;pharmacopoeia entries areextensive and mainstream physicians readily accept theconcomitant use of traditional and modern medicines. In 2000, the House of Lords Select Committee on Complementary and Alternative Therapies reviewed themany and varied therapies and disciplines of the CAMworld. They suggested three areas need regulation, thefirst of which included herbal medicine and was the mostdeveloped in terms of regulation. The second areaincluded therapies which are most often used tocomplement conventional medicine and which do notproffer diagnosis. Examples would include aromatherapyHerbal medicines and the EU Directive ABSTRACT On 22 December, Lord Warner, the Health Minister, announced a number of new measures to regulate complimentary medicine in response toreport of a House of Lords Select Committee and a DoH ConsultationDocument published in 2003. Although the final paper, describing the way inwhich the government proposes to regulate herbal medicines andcomplementary healthcare professionals, has yet to be published, the DoH hasannounced that it will make \u00a3900,000 available to The Prince of Wales'sFoundation for Integrated Health over the next three years to develop robustsystems for the regulation of the main complementary healthcare professionals.A new Herbal Medicines Advisory Committee will be set up to advise theMedicines and Healthcare Products Agency on the safety and quality of herbalmedicines. The present Advisory Board on the Registration of HomeopathicProducts will retain its status as a free-standing committee, able to advise thegovernment directly. This paper reflects on current attitudes and legislation in theherbal arena.

The third area covered those disciplines which purport to offer diagnosticinformation as well as treatment but where the links toscientific principles of conventional medicine are less wellfounded. Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicinewere included in this group. The House of Lords Committee was concerned that members of the public were unable to differentiateproducts that had met the stringent requirements oflicensing from others which have not and encouragedthe Medicines Control Agency (now the MHRA) to findan appropriate mechanism to achieve this. They stronglyrecommended that the government maintain itsadvocacy for regulation in this area. The Department ofHealth, in conjunction with the European HerbalPractitioners Association and the Foundation forIntegrated Health set up a working group late in 2001 toreport with recommendations on regulation of bothherbal practitioners and also herbal preparations used inSection 12.1 (of the Medicines Act 1968). Their reportwas submitted to the government in July 2003 andpublished in September 2003. 4The Department of Health undertook consultation in both areas during thelatter months of 2003 and early 2004. 5The results of these consultations are awaited. The essence of both UK and EU legislation is the control of herbal products and in the case of the UK, of herbalpractitioners too. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society, incommon with others, recommended to the House ofLords Committee that it should be possible to controlsafety and quality of herbal remedies but that it wouldbe difficult to control efficacy. The logic behind thisposition is twofold. First, modern analytical techniquesshould allow reproducible fingerprinting of herbalproducts such that QA is provided. Second, many herbshave been used traditionally in many countries forhundreds of years, especially in India and China and inthese cases the safety question may be addressed byexperience. Of course, a process assuring the quality ofthe growth, collection and transport of herbal medicinebefore final product preparation will be necessary.Good Agricultural Practice has been described and thisalong with Good Laboratory Practice, GoodManufacturing Practice and Good Clinical Practice needsto be established. A second strand of interest in herbals is the widespread use of these remedies in the generalpopulation throughout the world; many of themobtained as OTC preparations. There are also anincreasing number of herbal practitioners in varioustraditions including Western Herbalism, TraditionalChinese Medicine and Ayurveda. However, there is aperception among the general public, and among somescientists, that natural products are safe. This is not asecure generalisation. In July 2002, the MedicinesControl Agency produced a report entitled Safety of Herbal Medicinal Products 6that gives an excellent overview of this area with extensive references. Thereport clearly demonstrates that a wide range of herbspossess inherent toxicity and also raises the questionof interactions between herbs and interactions withprescribed medications. Analytical control for herbals has also been an active area of debate. Classical analytical dossiers for medicines areless easy to achieve for herbal medicines. The costs ofgenerating such regulatory dossiers is high and wouldplace an undue burden on companies wishing to comewithin the regulations with products where thecommercial potential is low but where there is strongcustomer demand. Modern technologies such as FT -NIRor high-field NMR may provide a more cost-effectiveanswer and have given early indications that fingerprintingherbals may give adequate QA. This is crucially importantin this arena as the adulteration of products by similarplant species - the 'Aristolochia problem' or by chemicalssuch as heavy metals or steroids is a constant problem.The MHRA has clear evidence of contamination by suchmaterials and are supportive of the new legislation. In contrast, efficacy poses a more difficult question. In very few cases has it been possible to show clinicalefficacy in classical controlled studies. Where this hasbeen demonstrated, such products have achieved ProductLicenses. The EU Traditional Use Directive recognises thesame issues and suggests that evidence of 30 years' use,of which 15 years must be in the Community, would besufficient to comment on the safety element and wouldalso allow recognition of areas of utility on suitableproduct labels. This is meant to accommodate theincreasing use of herbal remedies in the EU, many ofwhich have derived from outside the UK, particularlyfrom India and China. From a pharmacological viewpoint, efficacy is at least as important as safety and quality. Given the costs of clinicaltrials it is unlikely that classical clinical trials will beconducted with many of the existing remedies but it isexpected that most will be covered by the Traditional UseDirective mentioned above. However, whilst manypharmacologists believe the efficacy goal may never beachieved with many herbals, all of us who have dealt withpatients recognise that improvements in symptomologyare common using herbal preparations and in some casescan be maintained for extended periods of time, evenyears. This is clearly more than a 'placebo effect' but isdifficult to quantify using classical trial techniques. Better descriptors of patient benefit in controlled studies need to be defined in the herbal arena and research isnecessary to achieve this. The MRC and the WellcomeTrust have discussed this and fund some work in the area.The MRC and the Health Care Research Collaboration,in Edinb 2005;35:25-27 \u00a9 2005 RCPEW DawsonGENERAL MEDICINE 26Herbal J Coll Physicians Edinb 2005;35:25-27 \u00a9 2005 RCPE GENERAL MEDICINEBrighton, in February 2003, supported an excellent workshop in this area, chaired by Professors RobertHorne and Paul Dieppe and a report was issued. 7It reflected on the tensions between allopathic and CAMpractitioners and the problems created for patients in thecurrent well-informed patient world. Evidence wasprovided that clinical benefit was achieved with someCAM therapies but the measures and tools were less thanoptimal to properly describe patient benefits. Clearly,more research is needed. In tandem with this methodology research, current studies with cannabis and other plant-derived materials inclassical studies will continue to close the circle in thisvery interesting arena. 8, 9There are hints from many of these studies that there may be synergy between thevarious constituents of plant materials and protocoldesign will become increasingly important. Although thecost-effective drive with allopathic medicines is to get toPhase 3 pivotal studies as quickly as possible, it is possiblethat in the herbal arena, wide ranging and good Phase 2data alongside traditional safety data could allow morerapid clinical or commercial exploitation. Following the post genomic revolution it may seem hardfor many to realise that it is only in the last 30-40 years that the balance of medicines has shifted from plant orbacterial-derived to chemically derived at the start of this period end gave direction to medicinal chemistry and major syntheticprogrammes to discover medicines have flourished. Theshortage of leads for new medicines has led to thecreation of many start-up companies in Europe and theUS using phytochemistry in combination with highthroughput screening and combinatorial chemistry tolook for new novel medicines. Many patients take prescription medicine alongside OTC medicine and herbal remedies. The pharmacist alreadyprovides effective counselling in this area and this isincreasing. The proposed regulatory changes should allowmore effective consultations between patients andprimary care practitioners and also should ensure accessto quality preparations prescribed and supplied byregistered practitioners. 27REFERENCES 1 Directive 2004/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, OJ 30.4.2004, L136/85-90 (http://medicines.mhra.gov.uk/ourwork/licensingmeds/types/thmpd/introduction.htm). 2 House of Lords Select Committee Report on Complementary and Alternative Medicine, ordered to be printed 21 November2000, HL Paper 123.
