And for good reason! When everything you do has the potential to impact that tiny little one you love beyond measure, you become a lot more conscious of the choices you make. This is why some women may hesitate to get the Covid-19 vaccine while breastfeeding, even if they are otherwise pro-vaccine and anxious to be protected themselves. But does the evidence suggest a need to delay? What the Research Says \"At this point in time we do have research showing that it is safe for breastfeeding parents to receive the Covid-19 vaccine,\" registered dietician and certified breastfeeding specialist [Krystyn Parks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystyn-parks-rd-033b8a9/) recently explained. \"There has been data showing that no mRNA from the mRNA vaccines is found in breast milk, however antibodies are passed through.\" This information is from the [most recently released data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565969/). And organizations following the science, to include [The Infant Risk Center](https://www.infantrisk.com/covid-19-vaccine-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding) and the [Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine](https://abm.memberclicks.net/abm-statement-considerations-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-lactation?fbclid=IwAR0LC26lCj_pJmpIHMa5QGdq9V8bN5XQsdIBYSyTXoYJMwqEP4SJIV2k5xw), have been nearly unanimous in their conclusion that getting the Covid-19 vaccine while pregnant is not only safe, it's also beneficial to the baby. Parks added, \"The [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/coronavirus-covid-19-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding#:~:text=Yes%2C%20ACOG%20recommends%20that%20breastfeeding,your%20child%20from%20the%20virus.)) recommends that lactating parents get vaccinated. The CDC [also recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20vaccination%20is%20recommended,become%20pregnant%20in%20the%20future.) that all pregnant, lactating, or those trying to conceive get vaccinated as well.\" The data we have now supports there being no reason for concern or delay when it comes to vaccinating while breastfeeding. Are There Any Risks? As with all forms of medicine, it's fair to wonder what the risks may be\u2014even when the evidence strongly supports vaccinating. But certified lactation consultant and owner of [Let Mommy Sleep](https://letmommysleep.com/), Jordan Seidel, CLC, said that so far, the known risks are minimal to zero. \"The most common symptoms reported were sleepiness and increased fussiness in babies,\" she explained. \"All evidence-based organizations agree that the potential benefits outweigh any theoretical risks of getting vaccinated while breastfeeding.\" Parks agreed, pointing out that any potential risks are in line with those of the general population. \"Because the vaccine itself does not pass through the breast milk, there is not additional risks to the baby,\" she explained. What About the Benefits? Of course, for so many organizations to be recommending vaccination while breastfeeding, there must be benefits, right? \"You pass antibodies along to your baby who perhaps would not get them otherwise!\" Seidel pointed out. \"What a gift!\" Because infants are not currently eligible for Covid-19 vaccination, and may not be until sometime in 2022, this chance to provide those antibodies to otherwise unprotected little ones is pretty huge. \"The amount of immunity is unknown, but would be higher than none,\" Parks said. \"There has also been research that shows that the more family that are vaccinated around an unvaccinated individual (in this case, the baby), the more protected the unvaccinated individual is. This has been shown in a population level and is the basis of herd immunity, but was recently shown on a personal level as well.\" And the more protection parents can provide to their entire families, the better. Addressing Concerns New parenthood can be scary, at times. Especially if you are struggling with PPD or related anxiety. So it's fair if, even after reading all the research, a new parent is still unsure about getting vaccinated while breastfeeding. \"Being concerned about anything new is valid,\" Parks said. \"I try to start by focusing on the positive. Giving your baby passive immunity to a disease that is literally causing a pandemic around the world is such a gift.\" While we don't yet know the exact level of protection provided, she said we do know that the immune properties in breast milk are amazing. \"Many moms are breastfeeding for some protective factor and this resonates with them,\" she said. \"Every parent wants to do what's best for their child. Unfortunately, there has been a great deal of misinformation regarding the pandemic and the vaccine. This causes a great deal of fear for parents especially.\" That's why she said it is so important to talk about the protective benefits of the vaccine. \"The risks of Covid to a baby are far greater than the risks of the vaccine,\" she explained. \"In the case that one or both parents get Covid, what would be the plan to protect the baby? What would be the plan if the parents need to be hospitalized? These are all questions that unfortunately need to be asked when remaining unvaccinated.\" And if your concern is what else from the vaccine, besides antibodies, your baby may get through your breastmilk, Parks said the answer is: nothing. \"Generally, I explain how the vaccine is broken down in the body within a short period of time and is not passed through to the breast milk,\" she explained. \"They have taken samples of breast milk post vaccination to test for this. Even if a small amount was in the breast milk, it would not survive the stomach acid. It wasn't designed to.\" When in doubt, it's always a good idea to talk through your concerns with a trusted healthcare professional. But the evidence is clear: getting vaccinated while breastfeeding is good for both you and your baby. "}
