It will also explain side effects, precautions, interactions, dosage, and storage information for Avipattikar. Dietary supplements are not regulated the way drugs are in the United States, meaning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement tested by a trusted third party, such as USP (U.S. Pharmacopeia), ConsumerLab, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, they are not necessarily safe for all or effective in general. Therefore, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about potential interactions with other supplements or medications. Supplement Facts StatesSuggested dose: Dosage may vary; no standard doseSafety considerations: Not well-documented side effects Uses of Avipattikar Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, pharmacist, or healthcare provider. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease. According to the principles of Ayurveda, health problems often result from imbalances in the three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Avipattikar is often used to treat imbalances in Pitta, the dosha most associated with digestion. Although practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine have long used Avipattikar to enhance digestive health and treat conditions affecting the digestive system, very few scientific studies have tested the formula's effects. Peptic Ulcers In an animal study from 2013, Avipattikar showed promise in the treatment of peptic ulcers, a condition marked by sores in the lining of the stomach, esophagus, or small intestine. In the study performed on rats, researchers determined that at a dose of 500 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), Avipattikar helped discourage the development of peptic ulcers by reducing the secretion of stomach acid. It should be noted that these results have not been repeated in humans, a necessary step before Avipattikar is determined to be a safe and effective treatment option for peptic ulcers. Other Uses Aside from peptic ulcers, Avipattikar is often used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat common digestive issues like: Constipation Diarrhea Gastritis Heartburn Indigestion GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease; acid reflux) Unfortunately, human studies on Avipattikar are lacking. Despite its traditional use in ancient Indian medicine, Avipattikar's use for these and other conditions is not currently supported by scientific evidence.
