Further- more, no party to a treaty or international agreement subject to registration which has not been registered may invoke that treaty or agreement before any organ of the United Nations. The General Assembly by resolution 97 (I) established regulations to give effect to Article 102 of the Charter (see text of the regulations, Vol. 76, p. XVIII). The terms \" treaty \" and \" international agreement \" have not been defined either in the Charter or in the regulations, and the Secretariat follows the principle that it acts in accordance with the position of the Member State submitting an instrument for registration that so far as that party is concerned the instrument is a treaty or an international agreement within the meaning of Article 102. Registration of an instrument submitted by a Member State, therefore, does not imply a judgement by the Secretariat on the nature of the instrument, the status of a party or any similar question. It is the understanding of the Secretariat that its action does not confer on the instrument the status of a treaty or an international agreement if it does not already have that status and does not confer on a party a status which it would not otherwise have. *. * Unless otherwise indicated, the translations of the original texts of treaties, etc., published in this Series have been made by the Secretariat of the United Nations.

The case of the \" Pious Fund \" is governed by the award handed down on October 14, 1902 in the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague by the tribunal constituted in accor- dance with the Protocol between Mexico and the United States of 1 Came into force on 1 August 1967 by the exchange of the said notes. 2 Translation by the Government of the United States of America. 3 Traduction du Gouvernement des Rtats-Unis d'Amdrique.

El laudo arbitral de 14 de octubre presentada por el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de America, en favor del Arzobispo de San Francisco y del Obispo de Monterrey, se rige por el prin- cipio de res judicata en virtud de la sentencia arbitral de Sir Edward Thornton de 11 de noviembre de 1875, enmendada por 61 el 24 de octubre de 1876; b) en los t~rminos de dicha pagar Gobierno de pesos moneda de curso desde 2 de al 2 de febrero de 1902; de de perpe- en Mexico. cumplimiento del laudo tral de 14 de Repfiblica Mexicana pag6 al Gobierno de los Uni- dos America la cantidad 1,420,682.67 pesos mexicanos, co- rrespondiente a las anualidades yen-America signed in Washington on May 22, 1902.' The arbitral award of October 14, 1902 provided as follows: (a) The claim presented by the Gov- ernment of the United States of America on behalf of the Arch- bishop of San Francisco and the Bishop of Monterey is governed by the principle of res judicata by virtue of the arbitral award of Sir Edward Thornton of No- vember 11, 1875, as amended by him on October 24, 1876. (b) By the terms of the said arbitral award, the Government of the United Mexican States was ordered to pay to the Government of the United States of America the sum of 1,420,682.67 Mexican pesos, legal tender of Mexico, represen- ting the annuities accrued but not paid from February 2, 1869 to February 2, 1902. (c) The Government of the United Mexican States was likewise orde- red to pay to the Government of the United States of America on February 2 of each year, in perpe- tuity, an annuity of 43,050.99 Mexican pesos, legal tender of Mexico. In compliance with the arbitral award of October 14, 1902 the Government of the Mexican Republic paid to the Government of the United States of America the sum of 1,420,682.67 Mexican pesos, covering the annuities accrued from February 1 Recueil ginlral 1969 cidas desde el 2 de febrero de al febrero de pag6 al Gobierno de fueron venciendo posteriormente hasta el 2 de consecuencia, para dar cabal satisfacci6n al laudo las fecha de la suspensi6n de los pagos; b) las que, en el futuro, ven- ciendo 2 de octubre de 1902. Animado del deseo dar una el los Estados Unidos de America, determi- una parte, el monto de la No. 99822, 1869 to February 2, 1902; and it likewise paid to the Government of the United States of America the annuities that accrued subsequently up to February 2, 1914, inclusive. Consequently, in order to comply fully with the terms of the arbitral award of October 14, 1902, the Gov- ernment of the United Mexican States must meet the following obli- gations: (a) The annuities accrued since the date of suspension of the pay- ments; (b) Those that will continue to accrue, in the future, on February 2 of each year under the terms of para- graph three of the arbitral award of October 14, 1902. Since the reasons for the suspension of the annual payments pertaining to the \" Pious Fund of the Cali- fornias \" no longer exist, my Govern- ment is quite willing to make an arrangement with Your Excellency's Government to settle this matter definitively on the basis of the award of October 14, 1902. Desiring to give a token of its goodwill, the Government of Mexico paid to the Government of the Uni- ted States of America in April 1966 the sum of 43,050.99 Mexican pesos, representing the annuity for that year. Furthermore, talks have been held between representatives of the Mexi- can Government and of Your Excel- lency's Government in order to deter- mine, on the one hand, the total300 1969 Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitds 301 y, por otra parte, el monto de la cantidad que el Gobierno Mexico al octubre 1902 de prevalecf a a la fecha del vencimiento de cada una de las anualidades que se adeudan. II. -Con el fin de liberarse la obli- gaci6n que le impuso el de anual de pagari al Gobierno de los Estados Unidos the Government of Mexi- co is obliged to pay in accrued annui- ties under the arbitral award of Octo- ber 14, 1902, and, on the other hand, the total amount that the Govern- ment of Mexico could pay to the Government of the United States, in a lump sum, to relieve itself of the obligation imposed upon it by the third paragraph of the arbitral award of October 14, 1902, to pay in perpe- tuity an annuity of 43,050.99 Mexican pesos. As a result of the talks to which I have referred, I am in a position to propose to Your Excellency the defi- nitive settlement of the case of the \" Pious Fund of the Californias\" on the following bases: I. The Government of the United Mexican States will pay to the Govern- ment of the United States of America the sum of 8,269,616.51 pesos, equi- valent to 662,099.00 dollars, in payment of all the annuities accrued to date. In determining this amount, the exchange rate of the Mexican peso in terms of the United States dollar in effect on the due date of each of the annuities owing was taken into account. II. In order to relieve itself of the obligation imposed upon it by the arbitral award of October 14, 1902, to pay an annuity of 43,050.99 Mexican pesos to the Government of the United States of America in perpetuity, the Government of the United Mexican States will pay 717,513.03 Mexican pesos to the Government of the United States of America in a lump sum, equivalent to 57,447.00 dollars of the NO 9982 302 United Nations -Treaty Series 1969 de los a la que fija sentencia arbitral de de octubre al pago de las sumas sefialadas en los pdrrafos I y II anteriores, el Gobierno de los Esta- dos Unidos de America por si y a nombre del Arzobispo de San Francisco y del Obispo de Monterrey, sus sucesores y causahabientes, conviene en senten- arbitral de Sir Edward Thornton de 11 de noviembre de 1875, enmendada por 61 el 24 de octubre de 1876 y de la sentencia arbitral pronunciada el 14 de octubre de 1902, en la Corte Permanente de La Haya, por el Tribunal de Arbi- traje constituido de conformidad con el Protocolo de la Repiblica de Mexico y los Estados Unidos de America firmado en Washington el 22 de mayo de 1902.

The Government of Pakistan agrees that the new type of investment gua- ranty authorised by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, may be issued covering investment in projects which have been approved by the Government of Pakistan after governmental consultations if these are requested by either govern- ment subject to para 2 below. 2. It is understood that the augmented coverage provided by the exchange of notes of March 27, 1968 shall not be deemed to enhance the contingent obligation of the Government of Pakistan to the United States Government. Nor shall the procedure envisaged under subpara (c) of paragraph 3 of the exchange of notes of May 26, 1955 be applicable to the augmented coverage except in so far as private investors had unsatisfied claims against the Government of Pakistan for goods delivered or services rendered to or for the account of the Government of Pakistan. 3. It is further understood that the Government of the United States of Ameri- ca will not issue any guaranty in connection with any project unless the project has been approved by the Government of Pakistan. 4. The Government of Pakistan will recognise subject to prompt notification the transfer to the Government of the United States of America of any right, title or interest of the guarantied investor in the goods, money, credits or other property on account of which the compensation was paid to the investor by the Government of the United States of America and the subrogation of the Government of the United States of America to any claim or cause of action or right of said investor arising from the foregoing, but excluding compensation paid as a result of losses enumerated in paragraph 3 of the exchange of notes of March 27, 1968. 5. Amounts in currency of Pakistan acquired by the Government of the United States of America in accordance with said guaranties will receive treatment no less favourable than that granted to private funds arising from the types of transactions covered by such guaranties. 6. It is understood that the Government of the United States of America will have no greater rights with respect to property or claims transferred in accor- dance with paragraphs 4 and 5 above than those previously held by the guarantied investor; and it is further understood that if the laws of Pakistan prevent the acquisition, in whole or in part, of any interest in any property within Pakistan by a foreign government, the Government of Pakistan will permit the guarantied investor and the Government of the United States of America to make appropriate arrangements so that such an interest may be transferred to an entity permitted to own it under the laws of Pakistan.

All general exhibitions fall into one of the two following categories: First category: Those in which the countries invited to participate are obliged to construct national pavilions. Second category: Those in which countries invited to participate are not permit- ted to construct national pavilions. 2. Not more than one general exhibition of the first category may be held in any one country during a period of fifteen years; an interval of ten years must elapse between two general exhibitions of either category. 3. In the case of general exhibitions held in different countries, the interval between these exhibitions shall be: (a) Six years in the case of general exhibitions of the first category; (b) Four years in the case of general exhibitions of the second category of the same nature ; (c) Two years in the case of general exhibitions of the second category and of a different kind ; (d) Two years in the case of general exhibitions of the first and second categories. 4. The intervals provided for in the preceding paragraphs shall apply to all general exhibitions without distinction as to whether they are held by Governments Parties or not Parties to the Convention. 5. More than one special exhibition of the same kind may not be held at the same time on the territories of several contracting countries. An interval of five years is compulsory before they may be repeated in the same country. In excep- tional cases, however, the International Exhibitions Bureau may reduce this period to not less than three years if it considers that such reduction is justified by the rapid development of any particular branch of production. The same reduction may be allowed in favour of exhibitions which by custom take place in certain countries at intervals of less than five years. 6. At least three months' interval must elapse between two special exhibitions of a different kind held in the same country.
