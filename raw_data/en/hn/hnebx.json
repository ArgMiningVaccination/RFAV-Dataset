Anyone delay MMR or chicken pox vaccine? I skipped it at my LO 12 month visit. And will most likely get the MMR at the 15 month visit. And the chicken pox later on. I didn't like that they had them scheduled on the same day and so young. I was going to hold off longer on the MMR since my LO isn't in daycare, but the doc recommended it sooner than later, regardless. Anyone else delay any of these vaccines? I don't know what to believe about any link to autism and MMR. But my doc has assured me this is false info and that it's been around for a long time and very \"safe\". Just want to see other thoughts on the subject, that's all. [For verified information about vaccines, visit our vaccine resources page.](//www.whattoexpect.com/family/vaccines) I'm a nurse and there's no reliable data that suggests that the MMR caused autism. But it is totally within your right to delay or retime vaccines as long as you get them! Totally understand the hesitation. While most doctors you meet will say they are safe and effective, it's totally appropriate and well within your right as the parent to ask questions. Any kind of medication or vaccine isn't without risk. There is a podcast called \"The Vaccine Conversation\" which is very informative and geared towards truly informed consent. It is not a pro-vax vs anti-vax; just straight facts. All of which can be verified as they get their information from the WHO and CDC (facts that aren't readily shared, but on there if you dig). They also utilize the same sources for research that you'll find throughout the medical community. You may also want to consider checking into VAERS to see how many serious adverse events took place from the vaccines vs the overall disease risk. We do not vaccinate and we are very happy with our decision. But, it took us a long time to get there with lots of digging, research, etc. I hope this helps! thanks for the info, I will look into that poscast! Yupp my toddler and my august baby did not get any vaccines yet we're just delaying them for now. I don't know when we'll do it but for now I'm delaying it and my doctor is totally on board with it and lets me choose the schedule for when it's the right time. Nope I did not delay! With less and less parents choosing to vaccinate we are seeing a resurfacing of diseases that were completely wiped out(or close to in 1st world countries) Looking up the devastating effects of some of these diseases is enough for me to know that if I did not vaccinate my child for say MMR and she got it I would NEVER EVER forgive myself!!!! I am 30 and got the MMR vaccine as a kid, it's been around a LONG time when you compare it to say the Covid vaccine, there has been a long time to collect longitudinal data on it if children who got it and now are adults having their own kids (ex me lol) perfectly well said I have two teenagers and never delayed getting any of their infant shots, so I haven't with my August baby either. I think there is an overload of information, and they try to link autism, ADHD and other disorders to so many different things because of a correlation. This was not the norm in the early 2000s. Regardless of anyone else, you have to do what you feel is best for your child, and you dont have to justify your decision to anyone. My teens have not and will not receive the HPV vaccine, and my middle child and August have not received the COVID 19 vaccine. My decision isn't based on scientific research but on experience and personal research into HPV that doesnt make sense to me and no doctor has made me feel confident in their answer. I supposedly had HPV 16 years ago and was told to get the vaccine by the ob doctor. I asked a second doctor, and they made a snide comment saying there is no point because you have already been exposed, so I never got it. Plus, I heard too many stories of people having adverse reactions to the vaccine. Of course, I did more research when it was being pushed to my teens. There are hundreds of strains of HPV. About 40 strains are known to impact the genital area, and depending on the vaccine on the market at the time, it only \"protects\" you from 4 to 15 of those 40 strains. If you give it to your child before 16 or 18 (I can't remember), they only get two shots, but if its after a certain age, they get three shots. The vaccine is no longer recommended to people after age 26 because they claim that by that age, most sexually active adults have been exposed. Even if you get the vaccine, you can still end up with HPV knowingly or unknowingly due to the number of strains that are out there. Nearly 85% of the population will knowingly end up with HPV at least once in their lifetime. The vaccine is just supposed to help with the risk of the ones that can cause cancer that they currently know of. can I ask (out of genuine curiosity) why not the HPV vaccine? As someone who was exceptionally careful and cautious about sex throughout my younger years, I still wound up with HPV from my second partner / long term relationship. I spent a lot of time wishing I had got the vaccine, but I actually hadn't heard the arguments against it. Genuinely just curious and perhaps a little ignorant trust your gut feeling, all I have to say is we don't vaccinate in this household, if you do your research, it's scary what is actually in those vaccines. thank you. I think by the nex visit I'll feel better about it, but it helps to hear others input. And I do have a cousin who had an adverse reaction to the HPV vaccine as a teen, so I think I am goin to skip that one as welll. I don't think I even got that as a teen, it's not necessary. Agreed on the covid vaccine as well- that's getting skipped! Yeah there's nothing reliable linking MMR and Autism. I know it seems like they're so young but that's the exact reason TO get the MMR and chicken pox vaccine. Any and all of those are quite serious in babies and we did it to protect our daughter. My son also had them on time and I have no regrets. What information are you going off that's making you delay? Just your gut? What's making you doubt medical evidence? Did someone say something? I asked a few friends what they did. A few have delayed as well. I did also have a gut feeling about it since it would be LOs first live vacccines and then did a little diggin online about it. My LO also isn't in daycare so it might be unnessecary to get so early on. I am not anti-vax, just would have rather waited till LO was a little older to make sure she was OK and not question if there was a link to autism etc. not delaying any of these. I'm a PharmD and will vaccinate my son on his 12 months visit. links to autism have been debunked decades ago. giving your tiny baby iPads and screen time is more damaging to their brain development than any vaccine with such a long usage out there. I wouldn't vaccinate my baby against covid or with any mRNA based vaccine yet because they've been on the market for way too little time to know their side effect profile entirely (here I'm talking cardiovascular/heart disease risk and risk of developing autoimmune conditions, not autism). but these old, well established vaccines that have been used for decades now (like 70+ years) against serious conditions are an entirely different ballgame. also the earlier you immunise, the better their immune response aka level of protection will be. so that's one reason not to delay them. thank you for your input. LO has actually done really well with all of the other vaccines, hasn't gotten a reaction yet. Agreed on skipping the covid vaccine too. That's a very good indication that he'll take other vaccines well too! happy to hear your LO has taken it well! Seriously, autism panic generated during the late 90s when one famous scientific paper published a study by a doctor who later admitted to inventing the whole BS for publicity sakes. so it was a fake from beginning on. he lost his licence after that. unfortunately the internet was already a thing back then for this to get picked up by conspiracy theorists. unfortunately the pharma industry is all but innocent and deserves the backlash and mistrust from people. however this makes it easy to sell whatever conspiracy BS to wide population, even about things that are safe and good. and this unfortunately hit the vaccines really hard in the western world. in other countries where these diseases were longer active and current generations still remember them, vaccination is the most welcome thing and the whole thing with autism really never took on. what everyone tends to forget when it comes to autism is that the definition of autism got SOOO broadened over the last 15 years that now virtually everyone can qualify for at least a few autistic traits. it has watered a serious condition down to demented 14 year old tiktokkers claiming to have it and act like health experts unfortunately. this unfortunately hits hard those who actually have it, because people who actually treat serious autism cases are constantly overflooded by healthy people asking to get diagnosed. it's just sad and the US has fallen for this more than any other developed country. every vaccine comes with a risk btw, I'm not saying that they're entirely harmless. but autism ain't on that list. I so agree with this! People are quick to cancel vaccines but are also quick to allow their baby to spend hours upon hours watching T.V./Ipads. There definitely should be more studies on this topic. Nope didn't delay. Always get his vaccines on schedule and feel great about it. I'm not sure if there's ever been any long term studies done to prove that autism is or is not linked to vaccinations. This goes for diseases, delays, and disorders as well. So not sure how that can be \"debunked\". I don't believe pharma has ever funded such a study. Feel free to chime in if you have a long term study/data for me to see. I'd love to read it. With that being said, I've done zero vaccinations for my one year old. So happy that her doctor supports my decision too. Wanted to add if you do a quick google search \"long term studies on vaccinated children\" you'll get some short term studies published by the government. Read these. this is exactly right - there's been no long-term or double blind placebo studies done on any of the vaccines on the schedule. If anyone actually ever looked at the study that \"they\" \"debunked,\" you will clearly see that the author stated that more research needs done and that just because there's a correlation does not establish causality. He didn't make such a bold claim like everyone makes it seem. Another little thing, and what is interesting to me, is that people will consider using aluminum-free ingredients in their antiperspirants because of the concerns/potential harm with aluminum getting into the lymph nodes/body but will not bat an eye about the amounts in vaccines. or maybe they just don't know??? Just food for thought. We delayed the MMR today. They're going to give it to him in 4 weeks. He got the other two today - chickenpox and hepA Jump to Your Week of Pregnancy Week 42](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/week-by-week/week-42.aspx) Trending On What to Expect Moms Share Home Remedies for Pregnancy Morning Sickness 8 Expensive Products Moms Say are Worth the Money You can't see this cool content because you have ad block enabled.
