Everything is sunshine, light and warmth - with an occasional thunderstorm thrown in for good measure. Don't let the scary headlines about swine flu bothe r you (see articles below) - eat well, get lots of sun, exerci se, relax, laugh, love, pray, explore and come in for chiropra ctic care. Blind man suddenly sees again after visit to chirop ractor KCRG-TV CHANNEL 9 NEWS IN DUBUQUE - Doug Harkey's visits to a chiropractor had been helpful, but not spectacular, until Thursday, January 3. Harkey is a legally blind 38-year-old Dubuque resident who parachuted out of an airplane in 2006. Not even tha t adventure prepared him for what followed his Januar y 3 visit to chiropractor Tim Stackis. \"My left eye w as watering for 45 minutes straight,\" Harkey said. Tha t left eye had been devoid of sight for 12 years. Goodbye blindness, hello restored sight. \"Oh my God, I can see!\" Harkey told a friend. Harkey and Stackis believe a chiropractic adjustmen t ... restored the lost sight. \"Your nerve system controls and regulates every function of you r body,\" said Stackis, who believes chiropractic care can influence healing throughout the body. http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/video/video.php?v =47668573581&ref=nf Vision and Chiropractic - what's the connection? The nerves from the brain and spinal cord affect th e eyes. Nerves exit your brain and travel down your back in your spinal cord (which sits inside your spinal column). These nerves then branch out of your spine and travel up to your neck and into your head. These nerves can affect yo ur vision, hearing and even the very functioning of yo ur brain. Over a hundred years of clinical research demonstra tes that chiropractic care can affect brain function. That's why anyone w ith a vision or hearing problem should get a chiropractic checkup. Epidural injections for neck and back pain We see it time and time again. Patients who were gi ven injections for neck and back pain by their medical doctors fill chiropractors' offices looking for relief. Here is another study showing the lack of long-term pain relief from epidural injections for people with neck and back pain. Three hundred (300) patients with neck and ba ck pain were given epidural injections. In two to six weeks, mos t epidural blocks lost their effectiveness. There was no improvement at 3 months, 6 months or 1 year after injection. The epidurals had no imp act on day-to-day functioning, the need for surgery or long-term pain control. Why didn't the shot work? The reason is simple - injections do n't correct subluxations (chiropractors do). (1-2) Did you know...? When you take care of something it really does last . We mean it really lasts! Look at what this woman did with her car with regular check ups and a small handgun (gun is optional). 540,000 miles in the same car - original engine, ow ner 89 years old. (It looks like she's been taking care of herself al so.) Click on this cool story: http://growingbolder.com/media/technology/vehicles/ romancing-the-road-259598..html Swine flu /square6 The swine flu is no worse than a mild flu. /square6 The majority of those who get swine flu recover fr om it without medical care. /square6 There are cases of children coming down with the \" flu\" a week or two after they've been vaccinated. /square6 The swine flu vaccine is untested and unproven (as are all flu vaccines). /square6 The swine flu vaccine contains dangerous chemicals linked to serious neurological and immunological illness. /square6 The last time we had a swine flu scare the vaccina tion killed and paralyzed hundreds of people. One person died from the flu and that wa s because he went on a strenuous hike while he was sick. /square6 By the way, if you feel sick don't go on a hike. When it comes to the flu... /square6 In most all cases in relatively healthy people the flu should run its course. /square6 Suppressive medical care such as antibiotics, feve r reducers, other drugs and vaccinations can make the illness far worse. /square6 Comfort the patient with natural healthcare method s such as chiropractic, homeopathy, acupuncture, naturopat hy, etc. /square6 Give nutritional support - broths, light foods. Av oid refined and non-organic foods. /square6 The flu for most is a temporary inconvenience that leaves a less toxic, healthier person in its wake. Who Cares about the data, full speed ahead The swine flu vaccine has been rushed to the market even before safety tests are complete. A federal advisory panel said the FDA sho uld move ahead to approve or license the new H1N1 vaccine without waiting to receive dat a from clinical trials to test its safety and efficacy. (3) Does the swine flu vaccine increase the risk of can cer? German health expert Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg is a speci alist in lungs, hygiene and environmental medicine. He is also the chairman of the health committee in the German parliament and European Council. He warns us that t he solution that the vaccine is grown in consists of cancerous cells from animals. There is fear that the risk of cancer could be incr eased by injecting these cells with the vaccine. Johannes L\u00f6wer, president of the Paul Ehrl ich Institute, says that the swine flu shot can cause worse side effects than the actual s wine flu virus. Dr. Wodarg reports that the swine flu is milder tha n normal flu. \"If you look at the number of cases it is nothing compared to a normal flu outbre ak,\" he added. (4-5) Myths and facts about Tamiflu and Relenza Myth: Tamiflu and Relenza prevent flu complicatio ns. Fact: There is no proof antiviral drugs prevent com plications. A British Medical Journal study shows Tamiflu and Relenza rarely prevent complications in children who have normal seasonal flu and are unlikely to help children who catch the H1N1 virus. \"For most children these antiviral drugs are probably not going to have much of an effect,\" says study author Matth ew Thompson, MD in a BBC interview. The drugs have little or no effect on asthma, ear i nfections or the likelihood of children needing antibiotics. Tamiflu is linked to headache s, stomachaches, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, nightmares, self-injury , confusion and neuropsychiatric problems. (5-6) Chiropractic research Still more reasons to show that everyone - no matte r what their health - needs chiropractic care. Cerebral palsy and chiropractic. A mother brought her 2-year-old son diagnosed with cerebral palsy to exp lore chiropractic care. The child had multiple surgeries and the mother had been told that her child would never be able to walk. When he entered the clinic he was indeed u nable to walk unassisted and made very little eye contact . Chiropractic care was utilized to locate and correc t the child's vertebral subluxations. After four visits t he boy began to walk on his own, sleep through the night, gain weight and make more eye contact. He also showed im provement in muscle strength, cognitive function and fine motor skills. He is still under chiropractic care and continues t o show improvement with each visit. (7) Child with motor tics. A 6-year-old girl presented for chiropractic care w ith a medical diagnosis of \"transient motor tic disorder\" of six months duration. She had repetitive eye blinking and rolling of the eyes in multiple direct ions every 3 to 5 seconds, bilateral shoulder shrugging and backward arching of the head and neck with an open mouth. She had suffered trauma to the spine. Examination revealed subluxations of the atlas, C7 and T4 vertebrae and the right sacroiliac joint. She received chiropractic adjustments to correct su bluxations. After 6 visits over a period of 5 weeks her disorder resolved. She returned for car e 2\u00bd months later with complaints of eye rolling and repetitive blinking following an ic e-skating fall with complete resolution again after care. (8) Chronic chest pain. A 49-year-old male suffered from chronic chest pain , dyspnea and anxiety for over 4 months. Prior efforts to treat t he condition had met with failure. Chiropractic adjustments were given to the thoracic spine and by 14 weeks of care there was a complete recovery that was maintained at 9 mo nths follow-up. (9) Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. Twenty-three patients (aged 11 to 76) suffering fr om primary fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, of 2 to 35 years duration, received from 20 to 48 chiropractic adjustments. After care every patient was able to resume normal activities including full-time work and maintained their improvements at 1 to 1\u00bd years follow up. \"Improvement in symptoms of 92-100% was achieve d in both these syndromes.\" (10) Skip the Skippy\u00ae Buy some organic peanuts and make your own peanut b utter. It's easy and it tastes so much better. Avoid convention al peanut butter. Not only is it full of unhealthy sugar, it' s loaded with pesticides. More than 99% of peanut farmers use con ventional farming techniques including fungicides and other t oxins. So skip the Skippy\u00ae - it's bad for you and your children. Sunlight - nature's healing miracle The most powerful cancer fighter ever discovered is naturally occurring Vitamin D, which we get from sunlight. Thirteen malignancies have an inverse correlation t o solar radiation ... especially breast, colon, ovary and pro state cancer and non-Hodgkins lymphoma. (11) Vitamin D has the p otential to lower the risk of all cancers in women by 77%. (12) Researchers at the University of San Diego found a direct link between lower amounts of sunlight and increased breast cancer ris k in 107 countries (13), which has been confirmed by yet ano ther study. (14) Words of Wisdom Our body is a machine for living. It is organized f or that, it is its nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend i tself, it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies. - Leo Tolstoy Humor The History of Medicine (unknown author) \"Doctor, I have an earache.\" 2000 B.C. - \"Here, eat this root.\" 1000 A.D. - \"That root is Here, say this p rayer.\" 1850 A.D. - \"That prayer is superstition. Here, dri nk this potion.\" 1940 A. D. - \"That potion is snake oil. Here, swall ow this pill.\" 1985 A. D. - \"That pill is ineffective. Here, take this antibiotic.\" 2000 A. D. - \"That antibiotic doesn't work anymore. Here, eat this root.\" When I got my first television set, I stopped carin g so much about having close relationships . - Andy Warhol Why should people go out and pay money to see bad f ilms when they can stay home and see bad television for nothing? - Samuel Goldwyn My grandfather always said, \"Don't watch your money ; watch your health.\" So one day while I was watching my health, someone stole all my money. It was my grandfather . - Jackie Mason The following statements about the Bible were writt en by children. They have not been retouched nor corrected - incorrect spelling h as been left in. David was a Hebrew king who was skilled at playing the liar. He fought the Finkelsteins, a race of people who lived in Biblical times. Solomon, one of David's sons, had 300 wives and 700 porcupines. When Mary heard she was the mother of Jesus, she sa ng the Magna Carta. When the three wise guys from the east side arrived , they found Jesus in the manager. Jesus was born because Mary had an immaculate contr aption. St. John the blacksmith dumped water on his head. Jesus enunciated the Golden Rule, which says to do unto others before they do one to you. He also explained, a man doth not live by sweat alone. It was a miracle when Jesus rose from the dead and managed to get the tombstone off the entrance. The people who followed the lord were called the 12 decibels. The epistels were the wives of the apostals. One of the oppossums was St. Matthew who was also a taximan. St. Paul cavorted to Christianity, he preaced holy acrimony, which is nother name for marriage. Christians have only one spouse. This is called mon otony. Bye!!! Enjoy the summer.
