It is the largest co-ordinated multi-national network of protected areas in the world, covering more than 18% of the European terrestrial territory of the Member States as well as significant marine areas. As establishment of Natura 2000 nears completion the focus is increasingly shifting to the effective management and restoration of sites in the netw ork. Ensuring a fully functional Natura 2000 network is central to achieving the EU target of halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the EU by 2020 1. Europe is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and European nature is to a large extent shaped by long-term human intervention. Th e sites in Natura 2000 reflect both historical and current human influences but the network also includes places that are in a relatively undisturbed natural state and where species and habitats of EU conservation concern are not dependent on human intervention. The management of the network will need to reflect the fact that human intervention has a key role to play in achieving conservation objectives for many of the sites whereas in specific cases non-intervention can be applied for the same purpose. There are also many degraded habitats which will require impo rtant investments and re storation measures in order to achieve the objective of favourable conservation status. Natura 2000 is not a system aimed at providing a ba rrier to activities. Instead, human activities need to comply with the provisions outlined in Ar ticle 6 of the Habitats Directive, to ensure that these activities are in line with the conser vation objectives of Natura 2000 sites. Whereas Natura 2000 fully embraces the principles of conservation and sustainable use a variety of protection approaches can be applied to the sites by Member States at national or regional level. Several Member States apply strict protection in parts of their Natura 2000 network to protect sites' natural conditions. As a management measure this means ensuring minimal human intervention in order to allow natural processes to predominate. There are examples of such setting aside of areas for nature or non-interventi on management in the Natura 2000 network. Natural processes require sufficiently large areas to allow for dynamic changes over time and space. Natural areas, where natural processes predominate, which are sufficiently large and lack infrastructure, or are managed to achieve those qu alities, are for the purposes of this guidance document being called wilderness areas. Many Memb er States designate areas with the purpose of preserving those qualities of wilderness, or a set of them, and may have a special class of protected areas for this purpose. However, it is important to note that occurrence of wilderness qualities is not limited to areas formally designated for their protection. Protection and restoration of wilderness and wild areas has gained increasing attention in recent years (see text box: EP Resolution on wilderness in Europe). Wilderness and wild areas are not 1 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/comm2006/2020.htm EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 6 explicitly mentioned in the EU Birds and Habitats Directives but applying a wilderness approach to the management of Natura 2000 sites is seen comp atible with the provisions of the Directives. Furthermore, scientific evidence shows that wi lderness areas are resilient against pressures affecting biodiversity and should be considered important tool in helping achieve biodiversity targets. Wilderness areas inside and outside protected areas could e.g. deliver an important element of Green Infrastructure 2, by the amount of various ecosystem services these core areas could potentially deliver, and their function as rese rvoir of biodiversity that can be drawn upon to re-populate and revitalise degraded ecosystems. EP Resolution on wilderness in Europe In 2007, a broad coalition of NGOs in Europe addressed a resolution to the European Commission and the EU Member States on the preservation of wilderness areas. This was foll owed in December 2008 by a report drawn up by Gyula Hegyi3, Member of the European Parliament, stressing the importance of wilderness in Europe to stop further loss of biodiversity. This report contained a motion on a European Parliament resolution on wilderness in Europe and was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. The vote on the special report on Wilderness in Europe provided the popular mandate for improving wilderness conservation in Europe as the report was adopted by the European Parliament on 3 February 2009. It was a non-legislative resolution bringing forward a range of recommendations, and stating the need for further action in several key areas - defining wilderness, mapping it, studying wilderness benefits, developing an EU strategy for wilderness, developing new wilderness areas, promoting them, bringing in effective protection of wilderness area s, accepting the Wild Europe Initiative, ensuring that wilderness zones are given special status and stricter protection for wilderness zones in the Natura 2000 network, getting Member States to set wilderness conservation as a priority in their strategy to address climate change and forward the resolution to the governments and parliaments of the Member States. The 'Wilderness Report' adopted by the European Parliament states that the European Commission should develop appropriate recommendations that provide guidance to the EU Member States on the best way of ensuring protection of present and potential wilderness or wild lands and their natura l processes, which are likely to be covered by the Natura 2000 network. In 2009 a first conference on Wilderness and Large Natural Habitat Areas was organised through the Wild Europe initiative in close cooperation with the EU Czech Presidency and ma ny other organisations. It brought together about 250 participants from 40 countries, including officials of government ministries, nature conservation agencies and NGOs, academics and interested partners from landholders, forestry, business and other sectors. This conference came up with an agenda for Europe's wilderness and wild areas, focusing on policy development, awareness building, information needs and supporting capacity (Poselstv\u00ed from Prague, 2009). http://www.wildeurope.org/images/stories/ article_pdf/agenda_for_wilderness.pdf The EU Natura 2000 network is generally not a network of strictly protected areas in which no economic activities should take place. Therefore in most Natura 2000 sites, a wilderness approach will not be th e most appropriate form of management. This guidance document should therefore not be interpreted as the Commission aiming to turn all Natura 2000 sites into wilderness areas. However, in specific cases, a wilderness approach can be the most appropriate or even necessary management approach for those specific Na tura 2000 sites hosting habitat types and species of Community interest whose main tenance or restoration to a favourable conservation status is dependent on some degree of wilderness qualities and natural 2 COM(2013) 249 final: Green Infrastructure (GI) \u2014 Enhancing Europe's Natural Capital: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52013DC0249:EN:NOT 3 Gyula Hegyi (2008). Report on Wilderness in Europe. Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. European Parliament, Session Document 2008/2210 (INI). EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 7 processes. And there will be sites for whic h a wilderness approach can be useful but not necessarily the only way to restore or maintain the species and habitats at a favourable conservation status. This guid ance document is applicable to those specific Natura 2000 sites. Purpose of this guidance document The purpose of this document is to guide the mana gement of those areas in Natura 2000 where the objective of management is to preserve wilderness qualities and consequently the chosen management method is non-intervention or set as ide and to present the current knowledge on the benefits of such an objective. By looking at the di fferent qualities of wilderness it aims to clarify the relevance of the Habitats and Birds Directives for wilderness areas, while taking into account other legal obligations such as the animal and plant heal th and the plant reproductive material regimes. It also aims to clarify and corre ct misunderstandings about certai n key aspects of the management of wilderness areas. It encompasses both non-intervention management and restoration measures in the Natura 2000 network because restoration is often needed in the initial phase of establishment of a non- intervention management regime. Restoration migh t also be needed in order to imitate natural disturbances that are missing for one or another other human induced reason. The document is intended to guide site managers in using non-intervention and set aside methods and present ways to solve potentially emerging conflicts. The current knowledge about the benefits and feasibility of non-intervention and set aside management is discussed in the context of different parts of the EU. Best practice examples are presented, encompassing management of wilderness and restoration of natural pr ocesses, and establishing wilderness. The document is designed for use by a multiple au dience of national and local authorities, site managers and other practitioners who are involved in the planning and implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives at both policy and fi eld levels. It may also be of interest to other stakeholder groups such as NGOs and other international bodies involved in nature conservation. Structure and contents The document is set up in 5 main sections: Chapter 1 provides a review of the literature on de finitions of wilderness as well as existing initiatives and legislative and statutory measures in the EU Member States to protect wilderness qualities. It provides a working definition for wilderness, taking into account characteristics relating to biological and anthropogenic qual ities of wilderness. The spatial link between wilderness and the Natura 2000 network is assessed. Chapter 2 presents a concise outline of the EU policy framework on biodiversity and of the Birds and Habitats Directives in particular. Key-issu es such as favourable conservation status, biogeographical regions, and management plans ar e briefly described. The position of wilderness and wild areas within the framework of internat ional conventions and Natura 2000 is discussed. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 8 Approaches for setting conservation objectives for wilderness areas in the Natura 2000 network are presented with a view to the qualities of wilderness. The structure and functions of natural habitats of Community interest and their typical sp ecies in the context of favourable conservation status is described. The measures essential for the maintenance or re-establishment of natural habitat types and species in wildernesses areas are presented. Chapter 3 presents a brief overview of ecosystem theory on ecosystem resilience, and gives an overview of different kinds of pressures on wilder ness and wild areas, based on the experience of site managers and a literature survey. It highli ghts important pressures on wilderness and wild areas such as habitat fragmentation, climate ch ange, and the spreading of invasive species. Moreover, this chapter provides a description of the key ecosystem services provided by wilderness areas and their socio-economic benefits for local communities. Special attention is given to the impact of sustainable forms of ecotourism for local communities. Chapter 4 presents a set of best practice examples of different types of wilderness and wild areas throughout the different biogeographical regions in the EU. Measures taken to ensure and improve wilderness qualities are described. Major potential conflicts between non-intervention management and natural hazards (e.g. bark beetles, forest fires, grazing/ herding) are considered. The objectives involved and the feasibility of rest oring wilderness within the framework of Natura 2000 are also described. Ecologic al connectivity, scale and zonati on are key-topics highlighted. Chapter 5 highlights stakeholder involvement as a key-element in the management of wilderness and wild areas. It emphasises that effective co mmunication strategies are needed for different target groups, i.e. local stakeholders, decision and policy makers and visitors/tourists. Several recommendations are made about communicatio n strategies based on best practices. Information for most chapters was derived from a literature review and from a questionnaire, which was distributed among site managers in the EU27, managing wilderness and wild areas. Best practice examples on existing non-intervention management and restoration management were derived from the questionnaire, supplemented with additional information from interviews with site managers. Limitations of the document This guidance document is intended to be bound by, and faithful to the text of the Birds and Habitats Directives and to the wider principles un derpinning EU policy on the environment. It is not legislative in character, it does not make ne w rules but rather provides further guidance on the application of those that already exist. As such, it reflects only the views of the Commission services and is not of a legally binding nature. It rests with the EU Court of Justice to provide definitive interpretation of a Directive. The document does not replace the Commission's existing general interpretative and methodological guidance documents on the provisions of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive. This guidance document builds on the previous guidance and has its legal background especially in the Articles 6(1) of the Habitats Directive and Article 4(1) and 4(2) of the Birds Directive. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 9 It seeks to clarify specific aspects of these pro visions and place them in the context of wilderness management in particular. The present guide is ther efore best read in conjunction with the existing general guidance and the two Directives. Finally, this guidance document recognises that the two Nature Directives are enshrined in the principle of subsidiarity and it is for Member States to determine the management requirements arising from the Directives. The good practice procedures and proposed methodologies described in this document are not prescriptive in their intent; rather they aim to offer useful advice, ideas and suggestions based on an extensive review of ex isting experiences and good practices across the EU and beyond. For further read ing, references to various do cuments and other sources of information are provided in the Annexes. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 10 1 What is wilderness in the context of Natura 2000? Qualities of wilderness are naturalness, free fu nctioning natural processes, largeness and the absence of developments. Spatial analyses of wilder ness qualities in EU show that areas with most wilderness qualities occur in the Boreal, Alpine an d Mediterranean regions, whereas wilderness is largely missing in the Atlantic and Continental regi ons. A wide range of habitat types and species of Community interest benefits from wilderness mana gement. Based on an analysis of the Common Database on Designated Areas (CDDA), around 4% of the Natura 2000 network is strictly protected (IUCN protected areas categories Ia and Ib, see chapter 1.4.1). 1.1 Introduction This chapter provides an inclusive working definition for wilderness, taking into account aspects that are relevant for EU level guidance on manage ment of Natura 2000 sites. It is divided into important biological and anthropogenic qualit ies of wilderness which can be considered management objectives of a given site. A review of the literature on definitions of wilderness, and legislative and statutory measures in use in the EU Member States to protect wilderness and wild areas is presented. Moreover, th e link between Natura 2000 and wilderness areas is assessed and quantified based on European-wide datasets. The di stribution of wilderness qualities in Europe is mapped using a wilderness quality index4. 1.2 Definition of wilderness For the purpose of this guidance document it is important to have a clea r working definition on wilderness. The definition includes aspects that are relevant for EU level guidance on management in the context of the Natura 2000 framework, EU nature legislat ion and international commitments on protection of biodiversity. It aims to be applicable and relevant in all Member States and biogeographical regions and therefore co ncentrates on ecologically necessary elements. It is created for the purpose of this management guidance document in order to a) define a general conservation objective for a group of existing protected areas and b) define the wild state of the natural environment at one end of the wilderness continuum. It is not meant to be used as qualification criterion for areas. In this guidance document the below definition for wilderness is used: A wilderness i s a n a r e a g o v e r n e d b y n a t u r a l p r o c e s s e s . I t i s c o m p o s e d o f n a t i v e h a b i t a t s a n d species, and large enough for the effective ecolog ical functioning of natural processes. It is unmodified or only slightly modified and wi thout intrusive or extractive human activity, settlements, infrastructure or visual disturbance. The definition includes four qualities of wilder ness: a) naturalness, b) undisturbedness, c) undevelopedness and d) scale; an overarching and ch anging variable which by definition is central for the wilderness concept. 4 Fisher, M., S. Carver, Z. Kun, R. McMo rran, K. Arrell & G. Mitchell (2010). Review of status and conservation of wild land in Europe. Report: The Wildland Research Institute, University of Leeds, UK. 148 p. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 11 1.2.1 Ecological aspects of the definition Naturalness encompasses 1) the naturalness of the vege tation and associated species assemblages and 2) the natural processes involved. Natural vegetation and its associated species are th e result of biodiversity's unique evolutionary history with the local abiotic environment. Their pr eservation is not only important from a species protection point of view but also because it is important from the perspective of future evolution and adaptation to changing conditions. It is important to identify the spatial and temp oral scales at which the biologically relevant processes for different species and species groups take place in orde r to ensure that sufficient space is reserved for natural ecosystem's functi ons and formation of structures over time 5,6. The minimum size differs between ecosystems and depends on the given geographic and habitat conditions. An area should be large enough for the effective functioning of natural processes. Scale has a large impact on species diversity of natural ecosystems 7. Larger areas offer opportunities for a more varied spectrum of habitats and habitat heterogeneity increases the number of species that will be supported by the area. Moreover, it is known that habitat patches support small local populations and the smaller the local population is the more likely it is to become extinct in the future. Lower densities of habi tats also make it less likely for individuals of local populations to move successfully between the habitats and, therefore, less likely the network will support a viable metapopulation 8. Scale is not only important from an ecological point of view but it can also be defined by anthropogenic factors. A certain size is also often required to enable the protection of whole landscapes. This is important as people identify spiritually with the wilderness and feel emotionally bound to the landscape. The size of the area often determines the perception of 'wildness', i.e. if a visitor can experience solitude, wholeness and other spiritual experiences. The issue of sufficient scale must be considered with reference to the surrounding landscape as the quality of the surrounding landscape determines the ecological connectivity and the functioning of the ecosystems in the core area. The surrounding landscape also influences how the visitors experience the area. Therefore, wilderness is ofte n related to remoteness, although this is not a strict prerequisite. 5 Haila, Y., I.K.

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 12 Undisturbedness/unhindered, means that nature is essentially unhindered and free from modern human control or manipulation. This quality is strongly related to ensuring that the natural conditions are not manipulated and therefore ofte n refers to an administrative, statutory or legislative measure. The means to implement such measures vary between Member States and locally. Undevelopedness is another important aspect of wilder ness. Habitation, settlements or other human artefacts such as power lines, roads, ra ilways, fences may hinder ecological processes directly or by promoting the likelihood of human interference. 1.2.2 Wilderness continuum In Europe there are relatively few areas where all the aspects of wilderness as described above can be found in one place. More fragmented 'wild areas', however, can be found over a range of landscapes across the whole of Europe. In these areas natural processes may predominate and their habitats and species may significantly contribute to their favourable conservation status. However, the original natural ecological conditions have been slightly modified by extractive activities such as forestry and grazing, building of infrastructu re or other extensive human activities. They are often relatively small in size which does not allow for a full range of natural processes and functions and consequently cannot be perceived as wilderness. In the European context, and the Natura 2000 networ k in particular, it is important to notice that there is a spectrum of more or less wild areas a ccording to the intensity of human interference. In that sense, wilderness is a relative concept wh ich can be measured along a 'continuum', with wilderness at one end and marginal used land at the other 9. Re-wilding is a process to move areas up towards a wilder state, where the final stage is wilderness10. 1.2.3 Use of the definition in the guidance document In this guidance document the term 'wilderness' is applied to protected areas where management objectives of the site aim at achieving those objective s. The term 'wilderness' is also used for areas outside protected areas where most of the wilderness qualities are found. The term 'wild area' is used for sites in protected areas and outside protected areas where only some of the wilderness qualities are found, where the conservation objectives aim at achieving only part of the wilderness qualities, or where the objective is to fully restore natural processes and features with the aim to extend the wilderness core zone. 9 See example of wilderness quality index in BISE: http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and- maps/figures/wilderness-quality- index 10 European Wilderness Working Group (2011).

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 13 1.3 Other existing definitions The word wilderness has different meanings and co nnotations in different contexts, languages and cultures. Therefore, it is highly useful to reflect on the definition used in this guidance and compare it with the most commonly used ones internationally. Table 1.1 gives an overview of definitions for wilderness and wild areas as used by organisa tions involved in wilderness protection and management. Table 1.1. Comparison of various existing defini tions for wilderness with key-biological features and anthropogenic qualities. Definitions Key-biological features Anthropogenic qualities 1. A wilderness, in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognised as an area where the earth and its community of life are undisturbed by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain. An area of wilderness is further defined to mean in this Act an area of undeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and influence, without permanent improvements or human habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural conditions and which (1) generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of man's work substantially unnoticeable; (2) has outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation; (3) has at least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition; and (4) may also contain ecological, geological, or other features of scientific , educational, scenic, or historical value .11 untrammelled biophysical and biological elements no human habitation or control primarily affected by natural forces at least 5,000 acres (~2,000 ha) outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation 2. A wilderness is a large area of unmodified or slightly modified land, an d/or sea, retaining its natural character and influence, without permanent or significant habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural condition12. large area unmodified no permanent habitation preservation of natural condition 3. A wilderness is a landscape with a completeness of the native biophysical elements characteristic of the natural forces prevailing, as well as the geomorphological properties of the location such as water, geology, and land form13. completeness of biophysical elements completeness of geomorphological properties natural forces prevailing 4. Wildernesses are the most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet - those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructu re. A core aspect of wilderness is biological intactness 14. biological intactness no human control no infrastructure 5. Wilderness areas are large unmodified or only slightly modified natural areas, governed by natural processes, without human intervention, infrastructure or permanent habitation, which should be protected and overseen so as to preserve their natural condition and to offer large natural area predominance of natural processes no human habitation no intervention experience of spiritual quality 11 US Wilderness Act (1964). http://www.wilderness.net/inde x.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=legisAct 12 IUCN (2008).

Wilderness areas can be described as large territories without major human interference, the lack of which allows for natural processes to occur and wildlife to thrive in their natural ecological state. The protected area has an ecologically unfragmented wilderness area of at least 10,000 hectares where no extractive uses are permitted and where the only management interventions are those aimed at main taining or restoring natural ecological processes and the ecological integrity16. large territory no human interference natural processes prevailing unfragmented core area of at least 10,000 hectares no extractive uses 7. Wilderness areas are large natural areas free from human habitation and intervention, governed by natural processes, where people can experience the spiritual quality and sense of place in a manner that leaves the area unimpaired for future generations, areas unique to wildness, which represents a vital element of Europe's natural and cultural heritage. Wilderness areas can bring important economic, social and environmental services for local communities 17. large natural areas no human habitation no intervention natural processes prevailing environmental services experience of spiritual quality vital element of natural and cultural heritage socio-economic services 8. Wilderness areas are places where wilderness quality is recognised an d valued by society and are defined using arbitrary thresholds of remoteness, naturalness and total area. Wilderness quality is the extent to which any specified unit area is remote from and undisturbed by the impacts and influence of modern technical society18. naturalness remoteness undisturbed by impacts from modern society wilderness quality valued by society 9. A wilderness is an area governed by natural processes. It is composed of native habitats and species, and large enough for the effective ecological functioning of natural processes. It is unmodified or only slightly modified and without intrusive or extracti ve human activity, settlements, infrastructure or visual disturbance. predominance of natural processes presence of native habitats and species large natural area no intrusive or extractive human intervention little human habitation The key biological features of wilderness areas in these existing definitions are naturalness, the prevalence of natural processes, undisturbedne ss, largeness, remoteness, and the absence of developments. Anthropogenic qualities are related to solitude and experiencing spiritual, natural and cultural heritage qualities. The ecologically important features of these defini tions are covered by the scope of this guidance. Qualities perceived by man are not directly in the scope of this document as they are strongly dependent on cultural conditions, vary between Member States, and are not directly relevant for the achievement of the general objectives of the Directives. However, those qualities are of crucial importance when management me thods are selected and they are referred to in the relevant chapters of the guidance. 15 European Wilderness Working Group (2011).

The provisions for protection differ between the Member States, ranging from a total exclusion of all human presence, to selective presence for scientific research, educational reasons, or hiking and subsistence use of indigenous people. For cultural, historical and ecological reasons th e systems of protected areas vary between Member States. Based on analysis of the management object ives of the areas, the Member States' protected area schemes and their relevance for the protecti on of wilderness qualities can be analysed. The IUCN protected areas categorisation 19 is an established method for the categorisation of management objectives. 1.4.1 Strict nature reserve and wilderness (IUCN categories Ia and Ib) Protected areas with wilderness qual ities can most evidently be found classified under categories Ia and Ib (strict nature reserve and wilderness). Twelve Member States of the EU 27 apply a type of protected area corresponding to 'strict nature reserve' (Ia) or 'wilderness' (Ib) area as described in IUCN and its interpretation guidelines (Belgium-Wallonia, Bulg aria, Estonia, France, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia). A list of legislation aiming at protection of wilderness by these Member States is given in Annex A3. Comparison of national legislations for protected areas of category Ia/Ib shows that provisions for protection of 'strict nature reserves' and 'w ilderness' differ between the Member States. Naturalness : Most Member States state in their legislatio n that strict nature reserves are protected areas unaffected by direct human activity (e.g. Estonia), untouched or nearly natural (Latvia) or naturally preserved geotopes and habitats wher e natural processes take place without human influence (Slovenia). In some cases it is explicitly mentioned that restoration of natural development is allowed (Finland). Scale : Some Member States define the minimum size of strictly protected areas, such as Finland (1,000 hectares), but most do not. Aspect, such as scale of natural processes, may be included in the designation processes but strict protection re gimes as such in EU Me mber States would not seem to ensure that the scale of natural processes in strictly protected areas is considered. Undisturbed : Some Member States (Bulgaria, Estonia, Slovenia) prohibit all human activities, except the presence of persons for supervision, resc ue, scientific research or protection activities or visitors using marked hiking trails (Bulgaria, Estonia). Others are much less strict and allow restricted economic, recreation al and educational activities (Latvia). Others may allow under certain conditions, i.e. if it does not endanger the objectives for which the site has been established, 19 IUCN (2008). Guidelines for Applying Protected Area Management Categories; http://data.iucn.org/dbtw- wpd/edocs/PAPS-016.pdf EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 16 the picking of mushrooms and berries (Finland ). Finland also may allow activities such as reindeer herding, ice fishing and angling with the same prerequisite. Most Member States don't allow any form of extractive use of resources (Bulgaria, Estonia, Slovenia). Undeveloped: In some Member States (Finland) it may be allowed to build and restore accommodation for visitors, or the building and restoration of roads if necessary for guidance purposes, provided this does not jeopardise the purpose for which it was established. While it is reasonable to assume that the strict statutory protection schemes described above are in most cases used to protected wilderness qualities, it must be kept in mind that the list is not complete and that that one Member State may be us ing other types of nationally protected areas to protect wilderness qualities. Some of the national schemes are flexible in terms of legal framework, but strict provisions for the protection of wilderness qualities are described e.g. on the level of decree, order, by law or agreement. 1.4.2 Other IUCN categories Substantial areas for protection of wilderness qualities are protected in Member States by means other than assigning a strict pr otection status for the whole area. Wilderness qualities are often protected for instance in national parks (IUCN cate gory II) where substantial areas can be set aside as strictly protected wilderness zones by me ans of management planning. National parks themselves are often not established primaril y to ensure natural development but a non- intervention approach can be applied to part of the area, while visitor infrastructure is built, visitor flows steered and cultural landscapes managed in another part of the area. Additionally, it is important to note in this context that the categorisation developed by IUCN is based on management objectives, it happens that protected areas are assigned to a certain category based on intended future use, rather than the present condition, or are sometimes not managed according to the objectives of their designations 20. Finland has protected part of its wilderness areas wi th a unique system that merits categorisation under category VI. Finland defines in its Act on Wilderness Reserves (1991) wilderness as those places established: \" to preserve the wilderness character of the areas, to protect Sami culture and the traditional subsistence of the areas, and to enhance possibilities for multiple use of nature .\" The Finnish concept of wilderness is unique in Europe; human use is an essential part of the wilderness character of the areas. This type of Wilderness Reserves is classified under IUCN category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources) 21 by Finland. The Finnish wilderness concept has its roots in ancient hunting and fish ing culture. Finnish wildernesses are valued for livelihood, cultural tradition and recreation. Th ey provide income through reindeer husbandry, fishing, hunting, picking cloudberries and nature tourism. They are intended to protect the 20 Leroux, S.J., M.A. Krawchuk, F. Schmiegelow, L.G.

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 17 character of the wilderness areas from road infr astructure and mining. Th e forests in wilderness areas are kept in a natural state. 1.5 Spatial link between wilderne ss and the Natura 2000 network Many Member States apply a protec tion regime in parts of their Na tura 2000 sites that focuses on the preservation of natural conditions by setti ng aside areas for nature, or non-intervention management. It was estimated that around 4% of the Natura 2000 network is protected under strict regime (IUCN protected areas categories Ia and Ib) (Fig. 1.1). It has been reported before that 99% of protected sites of IUCN category Ia/Ib showed an overlap with the Natura 2000 network 22. As explained in the previous section, these figures do not cover all areas that effectively contribute to the protection of wilderness qualities. To get a comprehensive estimate of the total area of protected wilderness in EU27 we sh ould also add (parts of) those national parks and nature parks which are managed as wilderness (as partly the case in France, Finland and Sweden, for instance). This, however, would need analyses of site level data, including management plans and site specific protection provisions. Moreover, a 'size' parameter is difficult to include in this kind of spatial analysis. When discussing the sufficiency of size of wilderness, an understanding of the fundamental ecological processes and functions, along with their dynamic interactio n with environmental ch anges and ecological disturbances typical for the area is crucial. Further more, the required size is relative, as the quality of the larger surrounding landscape must also be considered. By using the existing datasets, i.e. CDDA, and co mbining it with the Natura 2000 database it is possible to give only an estimate of the magnit ude of wilderness protection in the Natura 2000 network. The CDDA database (hosted by the European Environment Agency) of nationally designated areas holds information on protec ted sites and about the national legislative instruments, which create protected areas. However, the CDDA-data for category Ia/Ib are partly biased because not all Member States have the sa me interpretation of these categories. This may result in a false estimate of areas protected with the objective to protect wilderness qualities. Moreover, analyses have revealed that the sp atial data in the CDDA-database are incomplete 22. Therefore, using available databases to localise wilderness areas in Europe only gives a rough and far from complete overview. An alternative approach is mapping, using a GIS- based approach. It is possible to map wilderness and wild areas by using attributes that indicate wi lderness qualities: e.g. naturalness of vegetation, ruggedness of the landscape, road and railway de nsity, population density and the presence of settlements. A 'wilderness map' for Europe ha s been published by EEA (2010) 23. This map was based on the work of the University of Leeds22 and used a set of criteria link ed to remoteness and naturalness. The maps show that the highest values of wilderness index may be found in the Boreal and Alpine 22 Fisher, M., S. Carver, Z. Kun, R. McMo rran, K. Arrell & G. Mitchell (2010).

Smaller an d more isolated areas may also occur in other areas of Europe. For marine areas it is rather difficult to find da ta related to their 'wilderness qualities'. Important attributes here might be: pelagic and demersal fish ing activity, oil platform and mining activities, pollution (fertilizers, organic) and shipping activity 24. 24 See e.g. Halpern, B.S . et al . (2008). A global map of human impact on marine ecosystems. Science 319: 948-952. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 19 2 EU policy framework on biodiversity preservation The EU Birds Directive (EC, 1979) and Habitats Directive (EC, 1992) committed the EU Member States to set up a 'coherent European ecological network of protected areas, named Natura 2000'. The Natura 2000 network aims to ensure biodiver sity conservation beyond national boundaries. The legislation aims to achieve the favourable conservation status of habitats and species, according to Article 6(1) of the Habitats Directive and to Article 4(1) and 4(2) of the Birds Directive. The European Commission publishes guidance docume nts to assist in the application of the two Nature Directives. 2.1 EU Biodiversity strategy The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD, ar ticle 2) defines biologic al diversity as \"the variability among living organisms from all source s including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems \". The conservation of whole ecosystems, including the characteristics and inherent natural processes, is an explicit aim of the CBD 25. The EU is internationally committed to the protection of biodiversity, and to halting biodiversity and reversing loss within the EU by 2020 25. In May 2011, the European Commission launched a new strategy to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 202026. The strategy includes six main targets, and twenty actions, which address the main drivers of biodiversity loss, and which will reduce the main pressures on nature and ecosystem services in the EU by anchoring biodiversity objectives in key sectoral policies. These include: full implementation of existing nature protecti on legislation and network of natural reserves, to ensure major improvements to the conservation status of habitats and species; improving and restoring ecosystems and ecosystem services wherever possible, notably by the increased use of green infrastructure; ensuring the sustainability of agriculture and forestry activities; safeguarding and protecting EU fish stocks; controlling invasive species, a growin g cause of biodiversity loss in the EU; stepping up the EU's contribution to concerted global action to avert biodiversity loss. The protection and, where necessary, restoration of Europe's last wilderness areas can significantly contribute to halting the loss of biodiversity. The benefits of these wilderness areas are significant, especially in terms of retaining biodiversity an d for addressing the adverse effects of climate change 27. 25 http://www.cbd.int/convention/articles/?a=cbd-02 26 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/natu re/biodiversity/policy/index_en.htm 27 Locke, H. & B. Mackey (2009). The Nature of Climate Ch ange, Reunite International Climate Change Mitigation Efforts with Biodiversity Conservation and Wilderness Protection. International Journal of Wilderness 15: 7-13. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 20 This guidance document will directly contribute to the attainment of four of the six priority targets -Protecting and restoring biodiversity and associ ated ecosystem services (targets 1 and 2) and Reducing key pressures on EU biodiversity (targe t 3 and 5). Under target 2, action 6b on Green Infrastructure relies on wilderness areas hosting mu ltiple ecosystem services as core areas, which could become instrumental e.g. in reducing fragmentation of ecosystems and improving the coherence of the Natura 2000 network. Under targ et 3, Action 10 aims to conserve Europe's agricultural genetic diversity which also includes the in situ conservation of crop wild relatives, and action 11 encourages forest holders to protect and enhance forest biodiversity. Action 12 aims to integrating biodiversity measures in forest manage ment plans by ensuring that forest management plans as much as possible include a range of measures, one of which being the preservation of wilderness areas. 2.2 EU Nature Directives At the core of EU biodiversity policy are the Bi rds and Habitats Directives, which provide the legal basis for the Natura 2000 network of protected areas. The ultimate objective is to ensure that the species and habitat types are maintained or restor ed to a favourable conservation status across their natural range28. In addition to designating sites under the Natura 2000 Network, Article 10 of the Habitats Directive also requires Member States to endeavour to improve the ecological coherence of the network across the broader countryside by maintaining and, where appropriate, developing features of the landscape which are of major import ance for wild fauna and flora, such as wildlife corridors or stepping stones, which can be used during migration and dispersal 29. For wilderness management, the most relevant provisions are those that relate to natural processes and allow sufficient scale for them, most promin ently to the management of the Natura 2000 network and to Article 10 of the Habitats Directive. 28 The concept of 'favourable conservation status' is not mentioned in the Birds Directive but there are analogous requirements, i.e. all SPAs must still be subject to special ha bitat conservation measures in order to ensure the survival and reproduction of the Annex I bird s in their area of distribution. 29 Kettunen, M. et al. (2007) for guidance on the maintenance of landscap e features in consistency with Article 10 of the Habitats Directive and Article 3 of the Birds Directive; http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/ecosystem s/docs/adaptation_fragme ntation_guidelines.pdf EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 21 Figure 2.1 The Natura 2000 network across EU 27 (status November 2010; Source: EEA). EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 22 2.3 Managing and protecting Natura 2000 sites The provisions of Article 6 of the Habitats Directiv e and Article 4(1) and 4(2) of the Birds Directive relating to the management and protection of Na tura 2000 sites are explained in the Commission guidance ' Managing Natura 2000 sites: The provis ions of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC'30. The guidance document describes in detail the requirements in relation to the protection and management of the sites; includ ing statutory, administrative or contractual. Whereas Article 6(1) deals with pro-active conservation measures31 that are required to be taken for Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), Article 6( 2), 6(3) and 6(4) include measures to prevent deterioration of the sites as well as procedural sa feguards to deal with plans and projects that may significantly affect the sites . The Member States are responsible for the protec tion and management of the Natura 2000 sites and they may choose more stringent measures than those provided by the Nature Directives. Article 2(3) of the Habitats Directive states that measures taken pursuant to the Directive shall take account of economic, social and cultural requirem ents and regional and local characteristics. The Birds Directive has similar provisions in Article 2. National systems of protected areas enable Member States to incorporate their regional and local characteristics along with economic, social an d cultural requirements into their individual management strategies. The national systems of prot ected areas are often fine-tuned to be sensitive to such requirements and characteristics. Mo reover, some systems we re implemen ted already before the Birds and Habitats Directives came into force. Communities sometimes also attach particular values to various protected areas and in dividual sites. This may be the case for example with areas associated with national or regional identity, such as national parks and national landscapes. According to Article 4(4) of the Habitats Directive Member States must designate their sites of Community importance as a special area of conserva tion as soon as possible and within six years at most. The competent authorities in each country should identify conservation targets and establish conservation measures for Natura 2000 sites at the moment of their designation as an SAC or SPA. The conservation targets and measures are to be based on the status and ecological requirements of the habitats and species for which the sites are de signated in Natura 2000. The ultimate objective is to ensure that the species and habitat types are maintained or restored to a favourable conservation status across their natural range 32. Objectives, targets and measures for the management of wilderness areas in Natura 2000 network are discussed in detail in Chapter 4. 30 Managing Natura 2000 sites: The provisions of Article 6 of the 'Habitats' Directive 92/43/EEC. 31 Art. 6.1:\" For special areas of conservation, Member States sh all establish the necessar y conservation measures involving if need be, appropriate management plans specif ically designed for the sites or integrated into other development plans and appropriate statutory, administrati ve or contractual measures which correspond to the ecological requirements of the natural habitat types in Annex I and the species in Annex II present on the site. \" 32 The concept of 'favourable conservation status' is not mentioned in the Birds Directive but there are analogous requirements, i.e. all SPAs must still be subject to special ha bitat conservation measures in order to ensure the survival and reproduction of the Annex I bird s in their area of distribution. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 23 2.4 Favourable conservation status The ultimate objective of the Habitats Directive is to ensure that the species and habitat types covered reach what is called a ' favourable conservation status' (FCS) and that their long-term survival is deemed secure across their entire natural range within Europe. The conservation status of natural habitat types and species present on a si te is assessed according to a number of criteria established by Article 1 of the Directive. The asse ssment of the FCS is done at the biogeographical level. The effects of climate change on Na tura 2000 are addressed in a special guidance document 33. In simple terms, FCS could be described as a situation where a habitat type or species is doing sufficiently well in terms of quality and quantity an d has good prospects of continuing to do so in the future. The fact that a habitat or species is not threatened, i.e. not faced with any direct extinction risk, does not necessarily mean that it has a favourable conservation status. The target of the Directive is defined in a positive way as a 'f avourable' situation to be reached and maintained. Therefore, the obligation of a Member State is more than just avoiding extinction. In the case of the species covered by the Directive this means that: populations are maintaining themselves over th e long term and are no longer showing signs of continuing decline; their natural range is not being reduced; there is, and will probably continue to be, a sufficiently large habitat to maintain its populations on a long-term basis. In the case of a habitat type , a favourable conservation status is achieved when: its natural range and the areas it covers within that range are stable or increasing; and the specific structure and function which ar e necessary for its long-term maintenance are present and are likely to continue to exist in the foreseeable future; the conservation status of typical species that live in these habitat types is favourable as well. The concept of FCS is not limited to the Natura 2000 network or to the species protected by this network (i.e. Annex II species). It applies to th e overall situation of all species of Community interest (Annexes II, IV and V), which needs to be assessed and surveyed in order to determine their current conservation status. Assessing and evaluating the conservation status of habitats and species within the Natura 2000 network is ther efore not always enough, especially when the occurrences of habitats or species are only partly covered by the network, maybe even in some cases only to a relatively small extent. Wilderness areas play a significant role in achievin g favourable conservation status of many species and habitats of Community importance. Wilderne ss qualities in a landscape contribute to the 33 Managing climate change for the Na tura 2000 network (available at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/climatechange/) ) EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 24 resilience of ecosystems against disturbances (see paragraph 3.1) and hence to the long term survival of its habitats and species. Wilderness areas are also important for the struct ures and functions and typical species of many habitat types of Community interest. Given the wide range of habitat types listed in Annex I and their inherent variability, it is not possible to give detailed guidance for each individual habitat type. However, it is clear that the various ecologic al processes essential for a habitat type must be present and functioning for the habitat type to be considered to be at favourable conservation status. Although, fragmentation is not mentioned in the Directive and can have some positive benefits in forest management (e.g. forest fire prevention) it can also disrupt habitat function and is a factor that should be taken into account when assessing the conservation status of habitats. The Directive uses the term 'typical species' but it does not give a definition, either for use in reporting or for use in impact assessments. In the guidance for Article 17 reporting it is advised to select typical species that reflect and are linked to favourable structure and functions of the habitat type, although it will not be possible to associate species with all aspects of structure and function. Given the variability of the Annex I habitats it is not realistic to have recommended lists of typical species, even for a biogeographical or marine region, indeed even within one country different species may be needed in differe nt parts of the range of a habitat or for different subtypes 34. 2.4.1 Requirements under Artic le 6 of the Habitats Directive Ecological requirements As explained in the Commission gui dance 'Managing Natura 2000 sites' conservation measures in Natura 2000 sites have to correspond to the ecologic al requirements of the natural habitat types of Annex I and the species in Annex II present on the site. These ecological requirements rest on scientific knowledge and can only be defined on a case-by-case basis, according to the natural habitat types of Annex I, the species of Annex II, as well as the sites which host them. The ecological requirements can vary from one species to another but also for the same species from one site and biogeographical region to another. The ecological requirements of habitats need to be reflected in relation to their typical species and the specific structure and function, as these are the aspects which define a habitat per se . These are also aspects that need to be co nsidered in terms of favourable conservation status for habitats. Typical species of the habitat are not necessarily found in the Annexes to the Habitats Directive, but they usually include naturally occurring bird species and fall in the scope of Birds Directive. Wilderness areas are potentially important for the fa vourable conservation status of a large set of habitats and species of Community interest. However, the identification of the ecological requirements of the natural habitat types of A nnex I and the species of Annex II present on the sites is the responsibility of the Member States. The latter may wish to exchange their knowledge in 34 European Topic Center (2011). Assessment and reporting under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive.

Some information about the characteristic species can also be found in th e 'Interpretation manual of the European Union habitats' 35. Article 6 of the Habitats Directive 1. For special areas of conservation, Member States shall esta blish the necessary conservation measures involving, if need be, appropriate management plans specifically designed for the sites or integrated into other development plans, and appropriate statutory, administrative or contractual measures which correspond to the ecological requirements of the natural habitat types in Annex I and the sp ecies in Annex II present on the sites. 2. Member States shall take appropriate steps to avoid, in the special areas of conservation, the deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats of species as well as disturbance of the species for which the areas have been designated, in so far as such disturbance could be significant in re lation to the objectives of this Directive. Article 4 of the Birds Directive 1. The species mentioned in Annex I shall be the subject of sp ecial conservation measures concerning their habitat in order to ensure their survival and reproduction in their area of distribution. In this connection, account shall be taken of: (a) species in danger of extinction; (b) species vulnerable to specif ic changes in their habitat; (c) species considered rare because of small populations or restricted local distribution; (d) other species requiring particular attention for reasons of the specific nature of their habitat. Trends and variations in po pulation levels shall be taken into acco unt as a background for evaluations. Member States shall classify in particular the most suitable territories in number and size as special protection areas for the conservation of these species in the geographical sea and land area where this Directive applies. 2. Member States shall take similar measures for regularly occurring migratory species not listed in Annex I, bearing in mind their need for protection in the geographical sea and land area where this Directive applies, as regards their breeding, moulting and wintering areas and staging posts along their migration routes. To this end, Member States shall pay particular attention to the protection of wetlands and particularly to wetlands of international importance. Habitat types of Community interest th at benefit from wilderness management Wilderness areas significantly contri bute to the favourable conservation status of a large set of natural habitat types, i.e. primary habitats, and the species they host. These habitats are unmodified habitats that are maintained by the dynamic forces of nature. The management requirements of these habitats differ from those of semi-natural habitats which have arisen through human management and use of land, and their continued existence is dependent on that. Examples of habitats that benefit from non-intervention management can be found under all habitat groups under Annex I to the Habitats Dire ctive. Those habitat types are aquatic as well as terrestrial, or closed woodlands as well as open grasslands, dunes, peatlands or rocky habitats. 35 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/habitatsdirective/docs/2007_07_im.pdf EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 26 *Pannonic salt steppes and salt ma rshes (habitat type and Riparian hard wood forests along rivers (91F0) are examples of habitats that can survive without human intervention as a result of abiotic conditions and natural disturbances. Large coastal dune complexes are formed by dynamic eolic processes resulting in the maintenance of a variety of dune habitats. River systems with intact natural hydromorphological processes are also examples of primary habitats with good co nservation values maintained by the prevailing abiotic conditions and natural processes. An approach that considers the scale of natural pr ocesses and dynamics of ecosystems is relevant for the natural regeneration of many habitats. Th e allowance of natural disturbances, the temporal and spatial variation in environmental conditions and the competition between individuals contribute to a diverse environment at many spatia l scales and supports the prevalence of a wide range of their typical species. For instance, many rare and threatened plant, fungi and animal species depend on the natural developmental stages of forests, rich in veteran trees and decaying wood. These can develop only in forests subjected to a long-lasting regime of natural processes, including disturbances such as storms and wild fire 36. It should be noted that a primary habitat in one biogeographical region may be a secondary habitat in another region, where it requir es management for its maintenanc e. For instance many grassland and heathland habitats are likely to be primary ha bitats in the Alpine and Boreal biogeographical regions, but are mostly secondary habitats in the Atlantic or Continental regions 37. Scientific knowledge on ecology of Habitats of Community importance, especially their structures and functions and typical species, is already vast bu t more research is needed even in relation to the most studied ones. To collect examples of habitat types that are of particular importance in terms of wilderness, and whose favourable conservation status benefits fr om non-intervention management a questionnaire was sent to Natura 2000 site managers of wilder ness areas throughout Europe. They were asked to mention the five most important habitat types in their areas representing wilderness value. This gave a list of 80 habitat types (see Annex A5). Although this list gives a picture of the types of habitats that benefit from wilderness management , it is not complete as some biogeographical regions were not represented in the questionnaire and not all potentially benefitting habitat types and species are included. Species of Community interest that benefit from wilderness management, other than birds It is suggested in the scientific literature 38 that the following traits are expected to make a species particularly sensitive to fragme ntation: low population densit y, high-amplitude population 36 Stachura-Skierczy ska, K. & M.

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 27 fluctuations, low reproductive potential, limited storage effects, intermediate or low dispersal capacity, and specialised habitat requirements. Habitat fragmentation and reduced size of in dividual fragments often lead to adverse environmental changes 39, 40 which are likely to influence specia list species more than generalists41. This is true for example for habitat specialists such as several threatened polypore species that prefer large dead trees or old-growth forests and th ey are expected to have a higher extinction risk than habitat generalists 42. Some saproxylic species such as Phyto kolwensis with its general ecological requirement of long continuum of deadwood can serve as an example (see next text box). For this species the necessary conservation measures include the insurance of a supply of deadwood. However, a single trait of ecological requirement cannot be treated in isolation. In the case of P. kolwensis , the poor dispersal capacity should be taken into account and a sufficient scale and network for a viable long-term metapopulation shou ld be ensured. Many other invertebrate species as well, such as saproxylic beetles, are dependent on non-managed forests with large amounts of lying dead wood an d standing decaying veteran trees, which they need for their larval stage of their life cycle (see the example of Western Taiga hereafter). Scientific knowledge on such species and species groups is already vast and growing but more research is needed. Large mammal species such as Brown Bear ( Ursus arctos ), Grey Castor fiber ) benefit from large scale natural areas 43. They benefit from large areas as this helps to minimise any conflicts, but it is difficult to link them to any g iven wilderness related trait as they also thrive near human habitations. Large carnivore species have a role in natural ecosystems as top predators. They contribute to the regulation of herbivore density and therefore indirectly influence the grazing pressure. Carnivores can also in fluence herbivore pressure through behavioural modification, instilling fear and flight in their prey. For ex ample, in Yellowstone National Park, behaviour modification gave rise to the spatially explicit re generation of Aspen after the reinstatement of the Grey Wolf 44. A list of species of Community interest representi ng wilderness values was compiled by asking site managers of wilderness areas to list the five most important species representing wilderness value. This gave a list of 72 species of the Habitat Dire ctive and 59 of the Birds Directive (see Annex A6). 39 Saunders, D.A., R.J. Hobbs & C.R. Ma rgules (1991).

Much of its composition is depend ent upon its history. Some stands may be quite young, having regenerated after a forest fire t hat would have occurred over a hundred years ago, whilst others will be significantly more mature. Natural undisturbed western taig a - i.e. not subjected to commercial forestry - is extremely rich, providing habitats for many threatened species of lichens, bryop hytes, fungi, insects (mainly beetles, such as the threatened Phyto kolwensis ) and birds. The dead wood, in particular, plays a central role in maintaining this high conservation value. The endangered White-backed Woodpecker ( Dendrocopos leucotos ) is an important umbrella species in this habitat type. The preferred habitat for the White-backed Woodpecker is also used by many other red-lis ted species favoured by high abundance of dead wood and high proportion of deciduous trees. Fire with a cycle of 70-100 years is the most important natural disturbance for maintaining a mosaic of young and old successio n stages which are important habitats to many endangered species. Wild fires open up the closed tree canopies, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor and shaping optimal light condition for a rich herbaceous grou nd cover and associated fauna. For some species wild fires are a necessary part of the life cycle. Certain coniferous trees have cones which only open to release their seed after a fire and disperse their seed on a cleared soil characteri sed by a temporally flush of nu trients due to th e burning. The taiga hosts large mammal species such as Brown Bear, Eurasian Lynx , Grey Wolf, Elk and Reindeer and a range of middle-sized mammal species such as Beaver ( Castor fiber ), Hare ( Lepus spp.). Direct and indirect effects of forest management have been identified as the primary threat to flora and fauna in forest habita ts (e.g. Rassi et al., 2010). Species inhabiting decaying wood, including many cryptogams, wo od-decaying fungi and insects have suffered the most. Intensive forest management reduces the amount of dead wood at both the level of individual stands and the landscape. For instance, saproxylic beetles alone are represented by 800 species in Finland, of which 151 (19%) have been class ified as threatened (Siitonen & Saaristo, 2000). Phyto kolwensis serves as an example of a species that requires fire refugia, i.e. forests with very long continuity. Non-intervention management in wester n taiga thus favours a broad spectrum of species, in particular species that depend on decaying wood for their life cycle. Rassi, P., E. Hyv\u00e4rinen, A. Juslen & I. Mannerkoski (Eds.) (201 0). The 2010 Red List of Finnish Species. Ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6ministeri\u00f6 ja Suomen ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6keskus, Helsinki. 685 p . Siitonen, J. & L. Saaristo (2000). Habitat requirements and conservation of Phyto kolwensis , a beetle species of old-growth boreal forest. Biological Conservation 94: 211-220. Although this list gives a good overview of sp ecies of Community interest for which wilderness management is important, it is far from complete. 2.4.2 Requirements under Article 4(1) and 4(2) of the Birds Directive Article 4(1) and 4(2) of the Bird s Directive require special conservation measures to be applied to habitats of the species mentioned in Annex I to the Birds Directive and regularly occurring migratory species not listed in the Annex I. As ment ioned earlier, the content of these provisions is similar to those of Article 6(1) of the Habitats Di rective but refer specifically to Special Protection Areas classified under the Birds Directive. However, in terms of wilderness the provisions 4(1)b and 4(1)d deserve a closer look. Those provisions require that the measures take account of ' species vulnerable to sp ecific changes in their habitat ' and ' species requiring particular attention for reasons of the specific nature of their habitat' . Specific changes in a given habitat can be interpreted to mean changes that make the EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 29 habitat fail to correspond to the ecological requir ements of a given species. Bird species requiring old-growth forest habitats and vulnerable to human interference, would serve as an example for this. With regard to wilderness relevant ' specific nature of habitat ', prevalence of deadwood and saproxylic beetles, can be taken as an example. However, Member States themselves should identify the most suitable and effective conservation measures. The exchange of knowledge regarding how to manage habitats for specific birds species is promoted by the European Commission and supported by EEA/ETC. Effective co nservation of migratory birds in particular, mostly requires international cooperation. Unlike those measures described above for the Habitats Directive, there is no obligation to take necessary special conservation measures for SP As. However, management plans, statutory, administrative or contractual measures are a ppropriate special conservation measures. The application of measures is the responsibility of the Member States. Management plans can be developed up for Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and the same general principles shall apply as those existing for the management plans developed for SACs. Bird species of Community interest th at benefit from wilderness management Bird species that are specialist of old-growth forest are important in terms of wilderness. Old- growth forest specialist species in boreal an d et al . (1997) identified 27 (threatened and habitat depended) species in Europe that excavate their own or use natural or abandoned holes. All of these species would seem to benefit from a wilderness approach and from an increase in dead trees. In the Mediterranean region species that need old, mature forest stands with dead or tall emergent trees include Black some bird species the habitat is important. ( Perisoreus infaustus) are examples of species that need large areas 45. Pristine riverine forests harbour some of the most diverse breeding bird fauna, which include species such as Black Stork ( Ciconia nigra ), White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus species of taiga that benefit from the natural character of the forest include Siberian Jay ( Perisoreus G.M. & M.I. Evans (1997). Habitats for birds in Europe. A conservation strategy for the wider environment. Birdlife Conservation Series No. 6. Cambridge , UK; 464 p. 46 Tucker, G.M. & M.I. Evans (1997).

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 30 Grouse species assemblage in forests adapted to different stages of succession in primeval forests. After wind fall or forest fire, the Black Grouse starts to inhabit the youn gest stages of forest succession, followed by the Hazel Grouse which prefers forest stands of an age between 10 and 50 years. If the forest becomes more than 100 years old and gaps caused by windfall or insect calamities become more frequent in the forest canopy, the Capercaillie that is adapted to old growth forest finds its preferred habitat but also Hazel Grouse can live there if gaps will allow rejuvenation of a mixture of trees containing conifers, pioneer and other deci duous trees. Hazel Grouse, the smallest (350-400 g) of the Forest Grouse, is well adapted to the young stages of forest succession following natural events like fire, bark beetle attacks or other kinds of natural distur bances, and dense understory in multilayered old growth forests. Natural development instead of management activities is most favourable to Hazel Grouse. The home range size (10-50 ha, depending on habitat quality in mountain forests) is small an d a national park of 10,000 ha has enough space for 200 to 1000 individuals. One necessary precondition for long-term surv ival is the protection of natural succession processes after wind fall, bark and beetle attacks, followed by the undistur bed development of pioneer trees like birch, willow, aspen, mountain ash and other deciduous trees together with the high diversity of ground vegetati on. The removal of dead lying trees after wind fall has a negative impact on Hazel Grouse: va luable ground cover is reduced and the protection of pioneer tree succession from the impact of ungulates is diminished. Examples are well displayed in the Bavarian Forest National Park. Klaus, S. (2009). Forest grouse and wilderness. Survival without management impacts; In: Europe's Wild Heart, Conference 2.5 Relevant guidance documents The Commission services have developed a numb er of guidance documents to assist in the application of the two Nature Directives. This includes general guidance on the management and protection provisions of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive 47. Article 6 is the central provision covering positive management and avoidance of nega tive influences to the network; it also deals with plans or projects likely to have a sign ificant negative impact on certain sites. EU guidelines for financing Natura 2000 management through EU financial instruments have also been published 48. While the main responsibility for fina ncing Natura 2000 lies with the Member States, Article 8 of the Habitats Directive explic itly links delivery of necessary conservation measures to the provision of the EU co-financing. Th is is to be achieved by way of the integration approach whereby funding opportunities for Natura 2000 are provided in key sectoral funds. The Commission has evaluated the success of this integration approach with a view to the multi-annual financial framework for 2014-2020 49. This also explains how the \"prioritized action frameworks\" required under the Habitats Directive can serve as strategic planning tools to help strengthen the integration of Natura 2000 financing into the use of relevant EU financial instruments for the next programming period. Article 10 of the Habitats Directive recognises that ecological coherence of the Natura 2000 network as well as habitat quality is essential for the long-term survival of many species and habitats. It is of particular relevance when co nsidering the impacts of climate change. Coherence and interconnectivity in Europe involves the appl ication of climate change adaptation tools for 47 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/n atura2000/management/guidance_en.htm#art6 48 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natur a2000/financing/index_en.htm#guidancehandbook 49 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natur a2000/financing/docs/financing_natura2000.pdf EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 31 biodiversity, such as flyways, buffer zones, co rridors and stepping stones (connecting where appropriate neighbouring and third countries) . The European Commission has commissioned studies to prepare guidance on the maintenanc e of landscape connectivity features of major importance for wild flora and fauna50. The Commission has also provided guidance in relati on to the strict protection of animal species under the Habitats Directive 51. Articles 12 and 16 are aimed at the establishment and implementation of a strict protection regime fo r animal species listed in Annex IV(a) of the Habitats Directive within the whole territory of Member States. The Commission has also developed sector-specific guidance in the following policy areas: non- energy extractive industries, wind farm develo pment, ports and estuaries, inland waterway transport, aquaculture. The overall objective of these guidance documents is to establish a better understanding of how to apply the Article 6 procedure to development plans and projects in each of these sectors ,to provide further advice on how to carry out an Appropriate Assessment in particular 52 and to explain that human activities that are fully compatible with the sites conservation objectives can be carri ed out in Natura 2000 sites. 50 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/ecosystem s/docs/adaptation_fragme ntation_guidelines.pdf 51 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/con servation/species/guidance/index_en.htm 52 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature /natura2000/management/guidance_en.htm EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 32 3 Ecosystem resilience, ecosyste m services and benefits of wilderness areas In this chapter the benefits that wilderness areas can provide for the protection of biodiversity are presented. A brief overview of the concept of ecolog ical resilience and its im portance in the context of Natura 2000 is provided. The various pressure s on wilderness and wild areas, based on the experience of site managers and a literature surv ey is also presented. The important pressures on wilderness and wild areas are habitat fragmentation, illegal extraction of natural resources, and the spreading of invasive species. This chapter also provides a description of the ke y ecosystem services provided by wilderness and wild areas and their benefits. Key-regulating se rvices include carbon sequestration, flood mitigation, erosion control, air quality regulation and water purification. Mo st importantly, social and cultural benefits include (eco)tourism an d the creation of job opportunities for local communities. Moreover, wilderness and wild areas have high landscape and amenity values and are an invaluable resource for science, scientif ic research, education and inspiring cultural and artistic expression. Their ability of delivering mult iple services makes wilderness areas an integral component of Green Infrastructure (which ho wever also covers urban and semi-natural ecosystems). 3.1 Wilderness areas as resilient ecosystems Large-scale natural ecosystems, such as wilderness areas, are considered to have a high biological, functional and response diversity and therefore have a high capacity to adapt to changes in abiotic and biotic conditions, without shifting in a qualitatively different state. In other words, they are ecologically resilient. This important value is a great tool to fight identified threats to biodiversity and makes them unique in terms of provision of ecosystem services. Natural ecosystems are affected by different drivers and pressures. They are affected by anthropogenic pressures i.e. human-induced changes of ecosystem functioning such as deforestation, desertification, eutrophication, ha bitat fragmentation, land use change and climate change. Natural disturbances such as wildfire, in sect outbreaks, flooding, erosion and wind throw act as drivers . Maintaining biological diverse communities in pr otected areas will help to maintain ecosystem resilience and its adaptive capacity (see text box). Ecosystem resilience is closely linked to the assessment of the role of biodiversity within ecosystems and the ability of ecosystems to cope with human induced impacts (e.g. climate change, ha bitat fragmentation, etc.). Consequently, understanding the role of biodiversity within ecos ystems (e.g. trophic rela tions between species, functional traits, abundance and distribution) is more important than solely assessing species richness. It is important to note that within an ecosystem, the capacity only to buffer negative effects is not enough (ecosystem resistance). The ecosystem must be able to reorganise after disturbance, adapt to the new situation, and sustain important supporting ecosystem services. In this context spatial scale is an important factor, with large systems being better able to cope with natural disturbances EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 33 than small systems, and the preservation of ha bitats and species in a favourable state of conservation. Ensuring the sustainable persistence of species in a wilderness area by enabling the movement and spread of species within landscapes can increa se ecosystem resilience. Consequently, securing ecological connectivity within natural landscapes can reduce the negative impacts of fragmentation and climate change 53. The pressures outlined above do not act in isolat ion on biodiversity and ecosystems, but frequently, with one pressure exacerbating the impacts of another. For example: Climate change 54 Fragmentation of habitats may reduce the capacity of species to adapt to climate change, by limiting the possibilities of migration to areas with more suitable conditions; Increased levels of nutrients combined with the presence of invasive alien species can promote the growth of competitive, dominant plants at the expense of less competitive, native species. Climate change can further exacerbate the problem by making more habitats suitable for invasive species; Sea level rise caused by climate change combines with physical alteration of coastal habitats, accelerating change of coastal biodiversity 55. Ecosystem resilience Ecosystem resilience is defined as the amount of disturbance a system can absorb and still remain within the same state or domain of attraction56. This means that the system is undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks57. It is the capacity of an ecosystem to cope with disturbances wi thout shifting into a qualitatively different state. It is considered that the high le vels of diversity, i.e. biologic al, functional and response div ersity, increase the resilience of an ecosystem. The biological or structural diversity of an ecosystem is the diversity of physical structures within an ecosystem built up by species. This diversity forms important habitats for many other species and it also plays an important role in delivering different ecosystem services, e.g. regulating services. Functional diversity is the diversity of species that perform different ecological functions (e.g. predators, herbivores, decomposers, water flow modifiers and nutrient transporters), or perform a same function in different ways (e.g. insect and bird pollinators). The functioning of an ecosystem is based on species / groups of species that perform certain functions. Response diversity is the variability in response of species within one functional grou p to environmental change. That is, they all perform the same function, but they respond differently to changes in the environment58. 53 Kettunen, M., A. Terry, G. Tucker & A. Jones (2007).

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 34 Although the stability of an ecosystem depends to a large extent on the characteristics of the dominant species (such as life span, growth rate, or regeneration strategy), less abundant species also contribute to the long-term preservation of ecosystem functioning. There is evidence that a large number of resident species, including th ose that are rare, may act as \"insurance\" that buffers ecosystem processes in the face of changes in the physical and bi ological environment (such as changes in precipitation, temperature, pathogens). There is established but incomplete ev idence that re ductions in biodiversity reduce ecosystem resilience or the ability of an ecosystem to recover from a perturbation59,60. In the following paragraphs, important pressures on biodiversity, i.e. habitat fragmentation, climate change and invasive species, will be analys ed in more detail, and the capacity of wilderness areas to counteract those pressures and their effe cts is explored in paragraphs 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. Management practices in order to control th e pressures on wilderness qualities in the Natura 2000 network are presented in Chapter 4 of this guidance document. 3.2 Pressures due to anthropogenic disturbances Individual sites within the Natura 2000 network and their qualities of wilderness are often under pressure due to a variety of anthropogenic activit ies working at scales varying from the local, regional, national to the global scale. At the loca l and regional level for example elevated nitrogen deposition inputs may be a threat for the favourable conservation status of species and habitats. At the global scale the impact of climate change has an impact on ecosystem functioning. According to the Global Biodiversity Outlook 3 (2010) 61, the most important pressures affecting biodiversity are: a) habitat loss and degradation, b) climate change, c) excessive nutrient load and other forms of pollution, d) over-exploitation of na tural resources and e) invasive alien species. Site managers identified a more detailed set of pressures, most likely affecting the favourable conservation status of species and habitat of Commu nity interest in wilderness and wild areas (Fig. 3.1). The extraction of natural resources was most frequently mentioned as a potential pressure on wilderness and wild areas. It can be poaching, fi shing or illegal logging of wood. Other pressures mentioned were non-sustainable forms of tourism and environmental pollution. 59 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). Ecosystems and Human Well-being: Biodiversity Synthesis.

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 35 Figure 3.1. Major pressures for the favourable co nservation status of habitats and species in wilderness/wild areas, as mentioned by site man agers in the questionnaire (n=36 respondents). Other pressures mentioned are isol ation and fragmentation, lack of large predators resulting in uncontrolled bark-peeling and overgrazing of tree re generation. Lack of public awareness is also mentioned, meaning that local people are not alwa ys aware of the special qualities of wilderness areas and their benefits. 3.2.1 Habitat fragmentation Throughout the past centuries, many existing wilderness and wild areas have become fragmented and habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are ongo ing. Simultaneously, large areas across Europe have become depopulated62 which has created opportunities to restore connectivity and increase the viability of endangered species. It is known that habitat patches support small local populations and the smaller the local population is the more likely it is to become extinct in the future. A lower density of habitats also makes it less likely that individuals of local populations move successfully between habitats and, therefore, less likely that the network will suppo rt a viable metapopulation. Furthermore, there are well documented species-area relationships, with species richness invariably increasing with the size of the area 63,64. The protection of large natural areas from fragmentation, such as remaining wilderness areas is therefore of high importance. Mitigating landscape fragmentation and restor ing ecosystem connectivity (i.e. supporting the movement of species and the existence of viable populations within the wider ecosystem, as through Green Infrastructure) is seen as a key contributor in the maintenance of biodiversity, ecosystem functions and resilience in the long run 62. Enlargement of wilderness areas by interconnecting wild areas and amalgamating at the landscape level, i.e. increasing the structural 62 CBD (2010).

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 36 and functional connectedness is a strategy counteracting the process of habitat fragmentation and destruction. By protecting existing wilderness an d creating large-scale natural areas, systems will become more robust and more resilient which can effectively address the extinction-spiral of vulnerable species. Larger areas can host larger populations of vulnerable species and trophic chains can be restored because landscapes beco me suitable again for hosting large herbivorous mammal species and their predators. 3.2.2 Climate change Climate change has emerged as the leading environmental issue of our time 65. The cause of the rapid climate change is the result of two main kinds of anthropogenic actions: the large scale burning of fossil fuels and the conversion or de gradation of natural ecosystems. These activities release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from places on or under the Earth's surface where it was previously stored harmlessly or sequestered as one of a number of forms of carbon we call fossil fuels 66. It is beyond the scope of this report to review all impacts of climate on natural ecosystems. Aspects of climate change and how to manage them in Natura 2000 are presented in another guidance document. In general, climate change and the more frequent ly occurring extreme climate events will test the resilience of ecosystems, and their capacity for adaptation will be greatly affected by the intensity of other pressures that continue to be imposed. Thos e ecosystems that are already at, or close to, the extremes of temperature and precip itation tolerances are at particul arly high risk. Resilient areas, such as wilderness, are important in order to allow species more time to adapt, to move to new areas and locations with emerging living conditions, to be replaced by other functionally similar species. However, in order to preserve particular ly important species, the application of assisted migration should also be considered. The climate change process and the associated move of borders of zonal associations may create much high er migration pressure than the recorded highest migration speed after the last ice age. Because of th e quick shift in site conditions \"pioneer\" or high adaptive capacity species may take relative advantage from the changes and even develop \"invasive\" characters. Buffer zones around wilderne ss areas may help to slow down the migration of new/old invasive species. Resilient ecosystems help to cope with the impacts of climate change on habitats and species and on the services they provide for our societies. Cl imate regulation, flood control, erosion prevention and carbon sequestration are important servic es for societies (as promoted through Green Infrastructure). Therefore, wilderness management is considered an ecosystem-based approach for climate change mitigation and adaptation by maintaining and increasing ecosystem resilience. Carbon sequestration The protection of the carbon stored in bogs, mire s, forests and other ecosystems by leaving them undisturbed will be important in the fight against climate change. About 30% of the total historic increase in greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphe re is from deforestation. About 18% of annual global emissions come from disturbing ecosystems with large soil carbon storage, i.e. forests, 65 IPCC (2007).

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 37 wetlands and peatland67. Therefore, the protection of natura l ecosystems\u2014and especially primary forests and other wild areas such as wetlands an d peatlands\u2014will help to achieve climate change goals. The Commission has issued guidance on how to deal with the impacts of climate change within the context of management of the Natura 2000 Network. This has been prepared for site managers and policy makers and presents the latest scientific in formation on the risks posed by climate change to species and habitat types of EU conservation co ncern and provides advice, supported by good practice examples, on how to deal with the impa ct of climate change when managing Natura 2000 sites. It underlines the fact that an effectivel y managed, functionally coherent and well-connected Natura 2000 Network can play a vital role in help ing society adapt to, and mitigate, the impacts of climate change. It also considers how to ensure that Natura 2000 sites, and the species and habitats they aim to protect, are managed in a way that is adapted to the potential effects of climate change 68. 3.2.3 Invasive alien species The available information indicates that ecosys tems in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments have suffered from the impacts of invasive alien species,69. Invasive alien species represent a range of taxonomic groups including pl ants, invertebrates, vertebrates and fungi. They can threaten native species with extinction by a) predation; b) competitive exclusion; c) habitat change; d) hybridisation or e) impacts on native species' health through the transmission of pathogens or parasites (disease vector)70. Overall, invasive alien species are one of the main causes of biodiversity loss worldwide71. The DAISIE project (Delivering Alien Invasive Species Inventories for Europe) supported by the European Commission, provides consolidated info rmation of invasive species that threaten European biodiversity. It is one of the databases that can be consulted through EASIN 72 (European Alien Species Information Network). This can be used as the basis for the prevention and control of biological invasions, to assess the ecological an d socio-economic risks associated with the most widespread invasive alien species, and to dist ribute data and experience to Member States. Together with an underpinning surveillance and in spection system this would create a basis for an early warning system. It has been found that modified environments are much more susceptible to the successful establishment of invasive alien specie s, compared to natural environments 73.

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 38 species are considered causing less problems than in modified ecosystems. However, in some cases established or extending invasive species in wilderness areas are controlled or eradicated. Examples are American mink ( mantegazzianum ). More information on the EU policy on Invasive Alien Species is available at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/n ature/invasivealien/index_en.htm . 3.3 Ecosystem services and benefits of Natura 2000 and wilderness Protected areas, such as Natura 2000 sites, contain biodiversity and ecosystems of high conservation value. In addition, these areas provid e a range of benefits (direct and indirect) to our societies and economies. These benefits are often referred to as ecosystem services . Recent initiatives such as the study on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) have highlighted the importance of better understanding the economic value of ecosystem services and developing instruments to capture and reward these values, thereby encouraging the wiser and sustainable use of ecosystems 74. A recent economic evaluation ha s shown investing in Natura 2000 provides multiple benefits to society and the economy at the local, regional, national and EU level75. The network is a major store of carbon rich habitats and has an important role to play in responding to the challenges we face from climate change, both through mitigation and ad aptation. It also delivers other socio-economic benefits such as maintaining water flow and quality, conserving natural pollinators, preserving landscape and amenity values, and supporting tourism and recreation. According to this study, the benefits that flow from Natura 2000 are of the or der of \u20ac200 to 300 billion/year. It is estimated that there are between 1.2 to 2.2 billion visitor days to Natura 2000 sites each year, generating recreational benefits worth between \u20ac5 and \u20ac9 billion per annum. Therefore, investing in Natura 2000 makes sense and is directly re levant to Europe 2020 objectives of growth and employment as it can be a motor for the local and regional econom y. The costs of Natura 2000 per year have been estimated on 5,8 billion by MS (managing & restoring the network). Natura 2000, as a key element of Green Infrastr ucture, also helps to safeguard the flow of ecosystem services that are otherwise at risk of degradation. Investme nt in management and restoration measures can increase the provision of a range of the services, from the scientific valuation of sites to flood control and water purification as the conservation status of the sites improves. The strong legal protection that appl ies to Natura 2000 also has an added benefit, providing long-term security to any financial invest ments to safeguard the sites it contains and the benefits they deliver. Wilderness areas provide a wide set of ecosystem services common to most of the natural areas but they provide a set of services that are especially re levant to them. In terms of wilderness areas it is important to note that complete ecosystems, maintaining high levels of structural and functional diversity (see paragraph 3.1), are more resilient to external pressure and consequently better able to sustain the delivery of ecosystem services to human society. Moreover, it is equally important to 74 TEEB (2008). The Economics of Ecosystems & Biodiversity. Interim report. European Communities, Cambridge, UK. 75 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/natu re/natura2000/financing/index_en.htm EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 39 Ecosystem services Ecosystem services are the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems. According to the widely used classification developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) these services can be categorised as follows: 1. Provisioning services, or the supply of goods of direct benefit to people, and often with a clear monetary value, such as timber from forests, medicinal plants , and fish from the oceans, rivers and lakes; 2. Regulating services , the range of functions carried out by ecosystems which are often of great value but generally not given a monetary value in conventional ma rkets. They include regulation of climate through the storing of carbon and control of local rainfall, the remo val of pollutants by filtering the air and water, and protection from disasters such as landslides and coastal storms; 3. Cultural services not providing direct material benefits, but contributing to wider needs and desires of society, and therefore to people's willingness to pay for conser vation. They include the sp iritual value attached to particular ecosystems such as sacred groves, and the aest hetic beauty of landscapes or coastal formations that attract tourists; 4. Supporting services , not of direct benefit to people but essential to the functioning of ecosystems and therefore indirectly responsible for all other services. Examples are the formation of soils and the processes of biomass production and nutrient cycling. Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). Ecosystems and Human Well-bein g: Biodiversity Synthesis. World Resources Institute, Washington, DC. 100 pp. note that wilderness areas, such as strictly prot ected areas and national parks, are often protected in response to a sense of collective heritage or patr imony, a perception of shared cultural or social value being placed on treasured landscapes, ch arismatic species or natural wonders, and are therefore likely to provide important social and cultural services74. Based on a literature review, the key-ecological se rvices and socio-economic benefits of wilderness are described, especially with respect to their distinctive features within the context of Natura 2000. Special attention is given to the impact of sustainable forms of ecotourism for local communities. Non-intervention management would by its nature mean restrictions to extractive uses. Therefore, schemes of compensatory measur es are taken into account using best practice examples as basis for this evaluation. 3.3.1 Key ecosystem services European wilderness areas provide a set of ecosyste m services such as a) a refuge for endangered species and a home to undiscovered species; b) ha bitats with highly adapted fauna and flora, which would be lost forever if they were modified by hu man interventions; c) refe rence laboratories where evolutionary processes still cont inue; d) addressing climate change through carbon sequestration and flood mitigation. Wilderness areas offer species opportunities to adapt and migrate in response to climate change. Table 3.1 gives an overview of potential ecosystem services provided by Natura 2000 sites with wilderness quality. Several of the relevant ecosyste m services in wilderness areas are hereafter described in more detail. Supporting services EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 40 Supporting services of natural ecosystems are necessary for the production of all other ecosystem services. They are life-support functions and include processes such as primary production, production of atmospheric oxygen, soil formation, nutrient cycling, water cycling, and provisioning of habitat. The conservation of natural processes and associated biodiversity in wilderness areas has a positive impact on most supporting services and leads to positive synergies with provisioning, regulating and socio-cultural services 76. Provisioning services Although the extractive use of natural resources is not compatible with the conservation objectives of wilderness areas, the availability of biodivers ity resources outside the site can be strongly affected by the wilderness area. It can play an important role in contributing to the provisioning of these resources even though the actual harvesting of these resources takes place outside the area. This could be the case, for example, when a wild erness area functions as an important refuge or breeding place for fish or game species. Natura 2000 land users (e.g. fishermen, fish farmers, hunters and foresters) are the key stakeholders ma king use of the biodiversity resources outside the wilderness area (e.g. wild fish and game). Forest sites play a key role in providing game, whereas marine, coastal and inland water sites are source s for fish and other aquatic resources in the neighbourhood of the wilderness and wild areas (e.g. the example of Haddock 77).

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 41 Regulating services Carbon sequestration and storage: A substantial amount of carbon dioxide is stored in ecosystems, especially forests, we tlands and peatlands, which func tion as a strong buffer in the regulation of the atmospheric level of carbon di oxide. The characteristics of the vegetation determine how much carbon is taken up from the atmosphere and how much is released. Important characteristics are the primary pr oduction, which governs carbon inputs, and woodiness, which enhances carbon sequestration. In forest ecosystems, carbon is stored in living and dead biomass and in the soil. For instance, bo gs in northern boreal ecosystems have been shown to be cooling the climate through the uptake of carbon and will continue to do so if their hydrology is left undisturbed 79. Plant species also strongly infl uence carbon loss via decomposition processes and through the effect of other ecosystem services, e.g. the regulation of fire (which in turn affects the amount of carb on released in the atmosphere)80. 3.3.2 Social, cultural and economic benefits Here, only the direct benefits th rough market processes are describe d. It is worth noting that all avoided costs by the above mentioned regulating services should to be taken in account as economic and social benefits when be nefits of natural areas are assessed. It is reasonable to assume that wilderness qualities are an addition al asset in this regard, although, their added value is difficult to estimate. Wilderness areas have high landscape and amenity values. They are an invaluable resource for science, scie ntific research and education and inspire cultural and artistic expression. They mostly also repres ent a high cultural heritage and archaeological heritage value. Sometimes they are part of reli gious pilgrimages. Wilderness and wild areas in general play an important role in awareness rais ing regarding environmental issues and can offer visitors an arena to get a practical insight into natural processes 81. Any Natura 2000/wilderness site protecting culturally important landscapes, habi tats or species can be an integral part of the identity of a region. The vicinity of a wilderne ss site may make a region more desirable and attractive. It may also have a positive impact on land and property values for local communities and landholders. Wilderness and wild areas have high landscape and amenity values and for their aesthetic benefits they are often highly preferred destinations for natu re tourism, i.e. tourism relying primarily on the natural environment for its attractions or settings. The presence of flagship species, such as Grey Wolf, Brown Bear and Golden Eagle, can form a high attractive value for these areas. However, certain wilderness areas may not be suitable for recreation or ecotourism due to their fragile ecosystems. 79 Frolking, S. & N.T. Roulet (2007).

It will have financial and economic impacts, such as an increase in incomes, jobs and business opportunities at the local and regional level. These impacts further contribute to the economic and social development of the area and region. The beneficiaries of this ecotourism include pe ople working in the tourism sector, or those providing support services to tourists. Local and regional businesses might profit by providing services related to recreation and tourism and site management might also profit from entrance or excursion fees. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 43 4 Management approaches for wilderness in Natura 2000 In this chapter management approaches for wild erness in Natura 2000 are presented based on best practice examples from different biogeograp hical regions. Non-intervention management aims to allow natural processes, prevents human inte rference and protects from human developments within a Natura 2000 site. It ensures a good degr ee of conservation of habitats and species by avoiding human intervention that could have sign ificant negative effects. Management objectives and the related conservation measures are descri bed below. Major potential conflicts between non- intervention management and natura l hazards (e.g. bark beetles, fore st fires, grazing/herding) are discussed. Objectives for the restoration of wild erness qualities in Natura 2ooo are described and practical measures to reach these objectives presented. 4.1 Introduction Building on the previous chapters, this chapter seeks to give guidance on how to manage wilderness areas in Natura 2000, to resist pressure s and to increase wilderness qualities. It takes account of the provisions of the Habitats Directive and Birds Directive and gives guidance based on best ecological knowledge. It gives special attent ion to avoiding or solving potential management conflicts. 4.1.1 Best practice Best practice examples of wilderness and restorat ion management in Europe were collected from different biogeographical regions (Table 4.1). Th e general information drawn from these examples is summarised. The results received from the questionnaire circulated among the site managers managing wilderness and wild areas throughout Europe also provided another source of information (Annex A4). The information was co mpleted with interviews with several site managers. The case study examples demonstrate through practical field examples of different habitats and biogeographical regions throughout Europe that a good degree of conservation of habitats and species of Community interest can be achieved in the Natura 2000 sites through management which pursues the preservation of wilderness qualities. The management authority of a particular site will decide whether non-intervention management is the right approach for its site. This chapter will provide tools and perspectives to assist with management decisions. 4.2 Planning non-intervention management Non-intervention management aims, where necessary, to allow natural processes by preventing disturbance by human activities that would have significant effects on biodiversity. To be successful, the conservation of existing wilderness areas and the restoration of wild areas must be embedded within the social, cultural and historical context of the relevant region. In order to gain the support of local communities, it is important that they can understand the opportunities offered and the environmental, social and economic benefits resulting from non-intervention management.

Site level conservation objectives are a set of specified targets to be met in a site in order to ensure that the site contributes in the best possible way towards achieving favourab le conservation status (FCS) at the appropriate level (biogeographical, national or regional level, taking into account the natural range of the respective species or habitat types) . Site level objectives should be established not only for special areas of conservation (SACs) under the Habitats Directive but also for special protection areas (SPAs) under the Birds Directive with a view to achieve the conservation of bird species. Favourable conservation status of habitats and spec ies of Community interest has to be achieved at the appropriate regional, national or biogeographica l level, but not necessarily at the level of each site. It may not always be indispensable to maintain each habitat type or species in each site in an optimal condition, but it is necessary to make sure that the conservation status of the habitats and species of Community interest will certainly not decrease but in the contrary, will maintain or achieve a favourable level at the appropriate regional or national level. Local fluctuations as a result of natural processes at the site level are theref ore acceptable, provided the FCS status at the national and biogeographical level is ensured. Ecosystems and habitat types are affected by internal dynamics. Structure and function are considered as inherent qualities of ecosystems and habitats. They are not stable per se , but are influenced by processes typical for living syst ems with the full variation of their ecosystem dynamics. Natural fluctuations at the individual site level following natural processes fit well within the Natura 2000 requirements, even if the area of some habitats types may locally and temporarily EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 45 decrease and while other habitats may develop or improve as a result of the same natural processes. Therefore, the maintenance of the dynamic complexe s of habitats, such as those in wilderness areas influenced only by natural processes with natural fluctuations, can be an appropriate conservation objective for particular Natura 2000 sites, provid ed FCS at regional, national or biogeographical level is guaranteed. Evidently, processes leading to a degradation of natural habitat types due to anthropogenic processe s are not permitted. In the case of species and habitats that benefit from or depend on natural processes, the targets for the protection of the relevant site can include the exclusion or reduction of human interference. The measures corresponding to the ecological requirements of such species and habitats can be selected accordingly. Setting short- to medium-term targets may be necessary in order to monitor the impact and efficiency of the measures taken. Based on the results of the monitoring, measures can be adjusted to better correspond to the needs. The definition of a set of targets will also be necessary in those cases where the current conservation status is not the desired one and restoration is needed. This will involve an assessment at the site level of the degree to which the habitat or species concerned requires management, if any, and where restorat ion to a particular degree of conservation is needed. This is important in order to make sure that the site fully contributes towards achieving conservation targets that may exist at a higher le vel (regional, national, biogeographical region or EU). In areas composed of both primary habitats, wh ich benefit from non-intervention management, and secondary habitats, which often need active management measures, zonation can be a successful strategy to contribute to a good degree of conservation of all habitat types and species concerned. A non-intervention core zone with wilderness values can be distinguished from zones with active management where other ecological va lues or socio-economic factors are essential (see also paragraph 4.2.7). Scale might also be a decisive factor in choosin g the most appropriate management strategy in a Natura 2000 site. Taking into account the dimens ions and scale implied by wilderness, restoring wilderness qualities would not be su itable in sites that are too frag mented or small-sized. Natural processes require sufficiently large areas to allo w for dynamic changes to develop over time and space. 4.2.2 When is non-intervention management not appropriate? In many Natura 2000 sites, non-intervention management or a set-aside approach may conflict with the ecological requirements of species or habitats of Community interest. Habitat types and species linked to traditional land-use practices, su ch as livestock grazing, hay-making, reed cutting, and wood-logging (coppice) can often only be maintained continuing these land-use practices 82 and their continued existence is dependent on that. Examples are semi-natural grassland complexes 82 Halada, L., D. Evans, C. Rom\u00e3o & J.-E. Petersen (2011). Which habitats of European importance depend on agricultural practices? Biodiversity and Conservation 20: 2365-2378. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 46 and hay-making meadows (e.g. habitat types 6210, *6 270, 6310, 6410, 6510, 6520, *6530). A list of 63 habitat types dependent on agricultural activities has been identified in the Annex II to the EU Biodiversity baseline 83. Furthermore, nearly 40 bird specie s and nearly 30 other species of Community interest are linked to agro -ecosystems83. Agro-ecosystems cover 38% of the surface of the Natura 2000 network83 and agricultural intensification and land abandonment have been identified as the two main pressures on biod iversity linked to agro-ecosystems in Europe84. Therefore, these Natura 2000 site s are not usually suitable for the introduction wilderness and instead continued low intensity agriculture, in those parts where the secondary habitat types occur, is normally the adequate management approach. In those situations where traditional forms of land use, such as grazing with livestock, are halted succession may become dominant process again. The abandonment of land creates a potential threat 85 to the maintenance and achievement of a favourable conservation status of many species and habitats of Community interest. However, it ha s been suggested that the impact of agricultural activities could be replaced in some instances by introducing wild herbivore species to the area (e.g. European bison, Red deer, Chamois, Ibex). If this is pursued, it is important to set up a good monitoring scheme to assess the impact of introductions on the habitats and species of Community interest at the landscape level. Even in wilderness areas, it might be necessary in some extreme cases to intervene. For example in the case of outbreaks of alien (outside of Europe ) forest pest species regulated by the EU plant health legislation. Several of these pests have a po tential to severely damage European tree species, which lack natural resistance against them and natu ral enemies. In certain cases, tree species could disappear irreversibly. Protecting the Union's forests requires therefore also in wilderness areas surveillance for outbreaks of such new pests and their early eradication, even if the eradication would be locally very damaging to the forest. Member State authorities should also take adequate measures to avoid uncontrolled introduction of such pests from more intensively managed areas into wilderness areas. In coordination with plant health authorities, alte rnative measures may be developed according to the local situation, an d providing sufficient guarantees for successful eradication. The procedures outlined in this paragraph do not apply to forest pest species, which are natural part (native) of European habitats, in line with natural dynamics of ecosystems as described earlier. Similarly, the control of certain animal diseas es regulated by either European or national legislation may include various measures (e.g. vaccination of foxes against rabies, of wild boars against classical swine fever, surveillance in presence of pathogens or to verify their absence, eradication thereof, culling of animals etc.) which, in order to be properly implemented, need close cooperation between authorities managing wilderne ss or wild areas and authorities implementing animal health measures. Management of the anim al population on these areas may also involve awareness of and consideration for the European ru les on animal by-products. Material from wild animals is largely excluded from the scope of the relevant legislation 8687. However, especially in 83 http://www.eea.europa.eu/publication s/eu-2010-biodiversity-baseline 84 http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/10-m essages-for-2010-agricultural-ecosystems 85 http://www.unep.org/pdf/GBO3-en.pdf 86 Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 laying down health rules as regards animal by-products and derive d products not intended for human consumption, OJ L 300, 14.11.2009, p. 1 EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 47 case of grazing, pastoral activities, handling of managed or hunted/killed wild game and other animals, there can be instances when these rules must be complied with or specific derogation therefrom must be granted (e.g. collection and handling of such material or for feeding to vultures). 4.2.3 Management measures in wilderness areas In order to achieve the targets set for the protection of a wilderness area, a management authority providing the stewardship of the area is needed. Pr eservation of wilderness qualities does not mean inaction. Various measures can and shall be taken in order to protect and maintain wilderness qualities, i.e. naturalness of the vegetation an d associated species assemblages and the natural processes involved (for further explanation see pa ragraph 1.2.1). These measures include ensuring that the correct administrative, statutory and le gislative measures are in place and followed. Management also involves management actions linked to visitors and local residents of the area as well as participating in the land use planning of the surrounding areas. To achieve the set objectives it may also be necessa ry to use restoration measures. Management measures of terrestri al and marine wilderness areas do not differ greatly. However, when the management of marine wilderness areas is planned special attention to the undisturbedness and naturalness of the water column and bottom ecosystems needs to be paid. Moreover, certain issues like noise pollution or invasive species may be more difficult to manage in aquatic than in terrestrial environments. A comprehensive approach together with stakeholders may help finding relief to those issues on local le vel. Eutrophication can be dealt with stakeholders the same way and the most important local sources of nutrients identified and tackled. 4.2.4 Management plans The Habitats Directive encourages the developmen t of management plans which are specifically designed for the site in question or integrated into other development plans. The management plan should ensure a good degree of conservation of pr otected areas and \"must be as clear as possible, realistic, quantified and manageable\" 88. In areas where management pursues preservation of wilderness qualities, management plan s are a useful tool in order to: record the habitats and species for which the si te has been designated as Natura 2000 site, so that it is clear what is being conserved; indicate the habitat types and/or species an d their localities for which conservation measures are planned; identify the actual status of the habitat types and species and the desired status which should be reached through the conservation measures; define clear and achievable conservation objectives; explain how the selected approach i.e. non-intervention/set aside contributes to the achievement of a good degree of conservation of habitats and/or species of Community interest and favourable conser vation status more widely; 87 Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 of 25 February 2011 implementing Regulati on (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down health rules as regard s animal byproducts and derived products not intended for human consumption, OJ L 54, 26.2.2011, p. 1 88 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/ management/docs/art6/provision_of_art6_en.pdf EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 48 identify the necessary measures together with the means and a time schedule which can contribute to meeting those objectives; describe the protection provisions for the maintenance and use of the wilderness area; record other actions rele vant to preservation of wilderness qualities; analyse the socio-economic and cultural cont ext of the area and the interactions with surrounding area and identify practical management solutions that can help integrate conservation activities with other land-use in the surrounding area; safeguard measures against potential effects on surrounding areas (e.g. bark beetles, or fire); analyse and consider animal and plant health me asures which may take place in the area in light of the presence of pathogens and pests of animal and plants. give access to other competent authorities or to those acting on their behalf, in particular in implementation of animal and plant health measures The following factors will need special attentio n when conservation measures are selected: size of the area, whether the area is large enough to allow natural processes; connectivity, whether there are buffer areas around wilderness or ecological linkages; need for restoration/existence of natural processes; zonation; provisions of the national protected areas system; potential conflict(s) with traditional uses; potential conflict(s) with extractive uses of the site; invasive species; potential impact of climate change. Additionally, the manager of a Natura 2000 site n eeds to consider the following options related to access to the site: visitor access (restrictions, steering of visitor flows); subsistence use by native/local people (typical in northern countries); access for only monitoring/research. 4.2.5 Compensatory measures to overcome limitations posed by wilderness Communities living in the vicinity or buffer zones of wilderness or wild areas may depend on natural assets for livestock feed, fu el materials, fruits and medicines 89. The establishment of a strict protection regime, such as a wild erness reserve, may affect their ac cess to resources on which they were traditionally dependent. The establishment or extension of protected areas may also have an impact on indigenous customary rights, values and beliefs. Despite considerable success in establishing conservation areas and national park s in many countries, conflicts over the use and management of park resources are sometimes a comple x item, difficult to solve. This is especially the case in areas where the use of resources is se en as incompatible with the pursued management objectives and the costs incurred from conservation to the local communities are more than the related incentives. In those cases compensatory measures could be considered in bringing a solution. This might be a decisive factor in wild erness planning projects to meet their intended 89 In this document, local residents are people living permanently in the close vicinity of the protected area. The close vicinity might be very different and depends on the ac cess and infrastructure ar ound the wilderness area. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 49 objectives. Therefore, local communities must be involved in wilderness planning, decision making and management processes, especially when their traditional land-use activities conflict with the non-extractive use of resources policy in the wilderness area to be established. 4.2.6 Measures taken to ensure and improve wilderness qualities During the preparation of this guidance document, many management authorities responded to the questionnaire (Annex A4) and reported on their experiences and practices. Based on these, a set of general management measures is listed for wilderness areas. These are supported with examples throughout Europe. Measure 1 : Zonation in order to combine protection of wilderness qualities and semi-natural nature and sustainable recreational activities Within one Natura 2000 site there are often area s that require different management measures. There might be a need to enable various management regimes within the same site in order to ensure the protection of both primary and se condary habitats. Although the measure can be applied in any Natura 2000 site, it is mainly link ed to larger Natura 2000 sites. Zonation of the site is often determined in the management plan. Non-intervention as a management tool is an integral part of the overall conservation strategy and visitor management in Fulufj\u00e4llet National Park (Sweden). The implementation of non- intervention management is supported by clear zonation. Zoning involves a pristine core zone where hunting, fishing and snowmobiling are forb idden. This is balanced by more intensively used recreational activity zones, where desires of locals can be fulfilled 90. This kind of zoning is a highly effective method of protecting key natu ral features and processes, while also ensuring the protection of the various habitats and their typical species. These include mires, alpine and boreal grasslands and heaths, subalpine and su barctic forests with their typical species. However, visitor pressure may be a controvers ial issue within the management authority of Natura 2000 sites. Visitors are seen not only as an opportunity to gene rate public support for protection, but also as a potential threat for the natural values. Such a threat must be considered in wilderness areas as well. The impact of tourism can be seen on soil (erosion), flora (e.g. illegal picking of specimens, trampling) and fauna (disturbance, modifying the behaviour of animals). Steering of recreational pressure, or in some cases even limiting it, may be needed. However, these issues can be tackled in many ways and the development of a zoning system to steer visitor pressure while still allowing visitors ac cess to certain parts of the area with specific provisions such as trails, has proven to be a successful approach. Soomaa National Park (Estonia) provides a good example of how zonation, as a management tool, makes it possible to simultan eously serve two purposes: organise public access to the park on duckwalks and protect the mo st sensitive areas. This, along with Soomaa's management tools to control visitor impact, has created a good balance between their two aims of strict conservation and raising public awar eness of the importance of natural processes. 90 Wallsten, P. (2003). The \"Inside-Out\" process. A Key Appr oach for Establishing Fulufj\u00e4 llet National Park in Sweden. Mountain Research and Development 23: 227-229. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 50 Zoning can take into account the distribution of recreational use, the access to the area, the carrying capacity of the area including seasonal an d specific characters of tourism use. There are various methods to define the carrying capacity of an area, and the manager should select the most suitable method 91,92. It should be noted, however, that the carrying capacity of an area might also be influenced by factors outside the wilderness area (access, tourism infrastructure, etc.). Another example of a functioning zoning system is found in Samaria National Park (Greece). The Natura 2000 site is protected by creating a core wilderness zone with strict protection and a 'highest' quality of wildne ss which is surrounded by a buffer zone which protects the core zone and where some human intervention may occur. The main aim of restoration of the wild area is to preserve th e natural environment and support local sustainable development. Here, an effective management rela tionship is being established between a core wilderness zone and surrounding wild areas. The wild area can be regarded as a buffer for the core wilderness, and both are being managed with respect to the other. Steps are being taken to rationalise existing practices across a spectrum of measures, especially in terms of managing external pressures, which are faced by the wild area - these include pressures from tourism and construction. Logging and pastoral activities have been halt ed in core areas, leaving pine tree forests undisturbed to develop and expand. Furthermore, activities permissible in different parts have been organised into zones - the core zone, a sp ecies and habitats conservation zone and an ecological landscape zone. In the core zone, for example, there are no road constructions and the collection or removal of fire wood and fora ging for mushrooms has been stopped, whilst in other areas this is allowed if for personal use. There has been considerable progress towards achieving a good functioning and workable balance and interaction between people and nature. Working in ways that explicitly take into account the traditions and culture of the people attached to the area, the protection of the landscape, its natural resources and important ha bitat types, animal and plant species is being ensured. At the same time, re-wilding is enabling natural processes to establish in increasingly larger parts of the area. Where a core zone is not large enough to allow full functioning of natural processes, plans can be made for appropriate expansion; where feasible , parts of the buffer zone can be restored and at a certain moment be incorp orated into the core zone. In Gorczanski National Park (Poland) the zone of strict pr otection regarded as wilderness has been extended on several occasions since 19 81. Plans to enlarge the core wilderness area over the longer term involve steps to include the nearest most natural forest areas, which themselves, are important ecological corridors. Su ch measures will contribute to the favourable conservation status of the Natura 2000 habitats and species involved. Although within the core 91 Jenner, P. & C. Smith (1992).

Recreation and Environmental Protection 135-140. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 51 wilderness zone most human activities are not allowed, there are facilities for visitors (hiking tracks and trails) and scientif ic research is permitted. Measure 2 : Guaranteeing ecological connectivity wi th adjacent areas to support migratory movements of species A site manager may want to restore ecological functions and increase the connectivity of the landscape to support the natural distribution and migratory movements of species. The measure can be applied in any Natura 2000 habita t and, it is potentially linked to a large number of species and habitats. Removal of fences is clearly directed for the benefit of larger species whose migration they might hinder. Remo val of roads, where appropriate, can be a relevant action to support sm aller animals such as carabidae beetles or amphibians. Large-scale restoration has been carried out in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany) for example by decreasing fragment ation in the park by applying restoration activities such as the removal of asphalt and grav el forest roads. In the past 10-15 years dozens of kilometres of roads have been removed or transformed, either by replacing asphalt with gravel or by allowing gravel roads to become overgrown. In Kalkalpen National Park (Austria), 310 km of road was closed from motorised traffic or restored to natural state in a LIFE project 'Management of Natural Forests in National Park Kalkalpen' (Life 99Nat/A/005915). The location and shape of the Central Balkan National Park (Bulgaria), as well as the long history of development of the reserves system, ha s resulted in a patchwork of wilderness areas. However, the management plan of Central Balkan National Park works towards more connectivity in the long run. It identifies not only the reserves zone but also a zone with limited human impact that is to act as a connecting ar ea between individual reserves. The combination of the two types of land helps establish and maintain the ecological connectivity of wilderness areas on a total of over 21,000 ha of land. Measure 3 : Restoration of modified habitats Setting aside man-made plantations combined with a controlled transition to natural vegetation composed of indigenous species is a measure to restore natural species composition and, eventually, natural structures and functions in both lowland and mountainous regions. Moreover, this measure will help increase the ar ea where natural processes can function and it can be used to increase connectivity in the landscape. Especially in central Europe there are large form erly managed areas that have been set aside. Areas include spruce plantations in beech forest sites at lower elevations (e.g. Luzulo-Fagetum beech forests (9110)). These spruce plantations ar e sensitive to bark beetle mass proliferations, and hence in dry summers, unless controlled, ba rk beetles will proliferate there. There is considerable danger that they will start spreading, including to areas with biologically valuable natural spruce forests at higher elevations (e.g. Acidophilous Picea forests of the montane to EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 52 alpine levels (9410)), if these are within reac h. Normally, in-situ mass proliferations would be limited due to the colder temperatures at the hi gher elevations but the influx of bark beetles from spruce plantations may make the natural spruce forests suffer and they might be completely infested and broken down 93. Therefore, it is important that the transition to natural vegetation dominated by indigenous species, especially in regions where bark-beetle creates problems, occurs gradually in order to prevent large-scale bark beetle infestations wh ich can spread to natural conifer stands and cause unnecessary damage. A controlled transition of man-made conifer stands would be the best way to prevent these catastrophes. Once a fore st is in a more natural state, infestations will occur only on much smaller spatial scales. Sometimes restoration measures are taken in order to speed up the initiation of natural processes and creation of natural structures. This is considered ecologically sensible as restoration is likely to produce habitats for ma ny endangered or locally extinct species typical for those natural habitat types and allow for their return at an accelerated rate. Typically, this kind of activities have been taken to restore e.g. the habitat type *Western taiga (9010) or *Bog bogs, and some 'Forest' habitat types, e.g. *Bog woodlands (90D0) of the Annex I to the Habitats directive require intact hydrology in order to maintain a favourable degree of cons ervation. Restoration of hydrology is typically done by plugging ditches, within or outside the borders of the site, where the ditching has impact on the hydrology. Measure 4 : Ensuring/establishing non-intervention management after natural disturbance Many managers of Natura 2000 sites with wilder ness have seized the opportunity to change the management approach to non-intervention after a drastic natural disturbance in order to allow natural processes to start and ultimately create habitat for species depend ent on those processes and enhance the quality of habitats. This measure can be applied to any habitats appearing in their natural distribution range and benefits species that are dependent on natural pr ocesses. It mainly concerns primary habitats which persist independently of any human interv ention and the species they host. In cases where the point of departure is not natural, specia l attention needs to be paid to ensure that the severity and magnitude of the disturbance does not cause conflicts with the land use of the surrounding areas or uncontrolled impacts to ot her habitat types within the Natura 2000 site (see paragraph 4.4). A good example of a successful change of management approach was seen when the management authority of Kalkalpen National Park (Austria) decided not to conduct sanitary logging in its territory after several severe wind throws in the fir/spruce/beech forests 93 Petercord, on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 53 (habitat types 9130, 9140, 9150, 9410). The resu lts of the non-intervention management were monitored carefully. Monitoring so far revealed that an increase in volume of deadwood from 16 m3 to 25 m3/ha and some 80,000 m3 wood lying on the ground since then has greatly contributed to viable populations of six different species of rare woodpeckers ( Picidae ) in these forests and their habitat quality. Another example can be taken from Bayerischer Wald National Park (Germany), where the monitoring of bark beetle calamity has prov en that abundant forest regeneration occurs naturally after old trees are killed by bark be etles. This disproves fears of the complete disappearance of forests in such areas. More of the actions taken by the park authority can be read in paragraph 4.3.1. Natural regeneration in itiates the development of conditions similar to those of primeval forests. The natural vegetation is certainly a mosaic of mixed forest types dominated by spruce, fir and beech (habitat ty pes 9110, 9130, 9410). At low elevation, on western and southern exposures, broadleaved tr ees occur more frequently, while at higher elevation and on eastern and northern exposures spruce still largely dominates the young forest stands. Measure 5 : Re-introduction and eradication of species Often the functions and structures of a given habitat type are missing due to missing key- species. In those situations the only feasible way of restoration is often the reintroduction of the missing key-species. In other situ ations invasive alien species ma y be disturbing the ecosystems in an undesired way and the eradication of the species is needed. In both situations the re-establishment of structures and functions is pursued. This measure can be applied to any Natura 2000 habitat where the re-establishment of natural species composition is needed. Since the beginning of the 20 th century, the Eurasian Beaver ( Castor fiber ) has been reintroduced in many European countries to re-establish viable populations. Europe's largest rodent species was exterminated in large parts of its natural range due to overexploitation. The Beaver is classified as an ecosystem engineer , because its dam building activities can change, maintain or create habitats (e.g. ponds with stagnant water) which has a considerable impact on the course of succession, species composition an d structure of plant and animal communities. As such it can be classified as a key-species in riverine flood plain, streams, brook valleys and wetland ecosystems 94. The Beaver is a species of European interest listed in Annex II and IV of the EU Habitats Directive. The reintroduction of Apennine Chamois ( Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata ) in the Majella National Park (Italy) is a good example of reintroduction of a species that naturally occurs in the area. With just a few hundred individuals remaining by the early 1990s, this invaluable species was one of the world's most endangered ungulate species. Due to the lack of an ecological corridor between their refuge area in Abruzzo National Park and the Majella mountains (where chamois had disappeared), hu man intervention was unavoidable. Over a several-year period about 22 animals were tran sferred to Majella National Park. Nowadays, 94 Rosell, F., O. Bozs\u00e9r, P. Collen & H. Pa rkere (2005). Ecological impact of beavers Castor fiber and Castor canadensis and their ability to modify ecosystems. Mammal Review 35: 248-276. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 54 their population has reached over 500 individuals. The Apennine chamois is also a species listed in Annex II and IV of the Habitats Directive. The Central Balkan National Park (Bulgaria) has started a reintroduction programme, which aims to release 150-200 Griffon Vultures ( Gyps fulvus ) in five years 95. The reintroduction of raptors in the park contributes to the comple tion of food chains in ecosystems in Central Balkan. Carcasses of wild species such as chamoi s and deer species are food sources for vultures (besides carcasses of livestock). The park also ta kes part in the national strategy to reduce the threats on large vultures in Bulgaria, and to even tually attract them back as nesting species into the Balkan Mountains. In Oulanka National Park (Finland) alien species, American mink ( Neovison vison ), are trapped mainly in order to improve the breeding su ccess of several bird species (waterfowl). The activity must be continuous as the species is difficult to eradicate totally. It causes great harm to bird communities and is being trapped and exterm inated in protected areas jointly with local hunters. Measure 6 : Forest fire prevention through promotin g native composition of forest habitats In the Mediterranean region, fo rest fires create a management problem in fire prone areas where the objective for management is to allow for natural mature vegetation with natural structures and functions. Although natural forest habitats (e.g. Galicio-Portuguese oak woods with Quercus robur Forest of Ilex aquifolium 9380) are more resilient to forest fires than monoculture plantations with high flammability species, the transition period from plantation to native fore st is a challenging period when effective forest fire prevention might still be needed, particularly in the Mediterranean areas 96.97 Promotion of natively composed forest habitats is currently most relevant for forest habitats in the Mediterranean region. It should be noted, however, that climate change will create longer dry seasons, which will likely lead to forest fire challenges in other climatic regions too. Therefore, the experience and best practice of the Mediterranean region should be shared with Natura 2000 managers throughout the EU 27. In Peneda-Ger\u00eas National Park (Portugal) fires are a major threat to conservation of fauna and flora. Outside the wilderness core zone, most occurrences are associated with grazing, i.e. fire is used to renew pastures. Therefore, the pa rk management is taking steps to minimize the extent and effects of wild fires occurring outside the core zone of the park, including fuel management actions at the level of bush clearing in forest stands and conducting prescribed 95 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3534 96 Proen\u00e7a, V., H.M. Pereira & L. Vicente (2010). Resistance to wildfire and early regeneration in natural broadleaved forest and pine plantation. Acta Oecologica 36: 626-633. 97 Forest Fire Damage in Na tura 2000 sites 2000-2012 http://publications.jrc.ec.europa. eu/repository/handle/111111111/27318 EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 55 burning in conjunction with the renovation of past ures for shepherds. When a fire occurs, it is always fought, or one is looking for extinction as soon as possible. In order to manage wild fires and to prevent conflicts with adjacent areas, the national park also has its own fire fighting teams and it establishe s partnerships with loca l teams of forest fire fighters in order to manage an ea rly warning fire alarm system. In case forest fire threatens local residents the management authority cooperates with the fire brigades. The costs of fire prevention are covered from a centralised fund. Majella National Park (Italy) also faces problems with fire management. According to the surveys and assessment of the park management, fires inside the park territory are almost exclusively linked to human actions, either intentional or accidental. Spontaneous wild fires in natural habitats are rather rare. The forest fires are tackled as much as possible technically. The legal background is provided by the general law on wildfires (L. 353/2000). Th is establishes that the aerial operations concerning wildfire fight are competence of th e civil defence Department, whilst the Forestry Corps, the Fire brigades and other corps operate in the field, coordinated by the Regional authorities, which have to create a permanen tly operative office for this purpose. The management authority is directly involved in this issue regarding forecast and prevention activities. The Park may also activate prevention patrols during the high risk season. The park management cooperates with fire brigades, c ivil defence Department and Forestry Corps in order to prevent fire damaging settlements. Measure 7 : Monitoring and providing opportunities for research activities Monitoring in order to detect and prevent conflicts and unwanted impacts from outside and to the outside is an important management measure for any given wilderness area. The monitoring is important in order to know whether the conservation targets are being achieved and if the management needs to be adjusted. Monitoring is especially important in relation to restoration measures in order to record th eir progress and effect iveness. Monitoring programmes in several wilderness areas designated as Natura 2000 sites enable experts to carry out long-term observations and serve as reference areas for research. Bialowieza Forest (Poland), is one of the largest remnants of pristine forest in Europe, and provides habitat for an almost complete assembla ge of species characteri stic for natural lowland forests. It hosts many rare species specialising on dead wood and large trees, typical for naturally dynamic stands. Bialowieza Forest has be en used for scientific research over a long period of time. There are many permanent study plots, some established in the early 1930s 98. The park facilitates studies on the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems, natural succession, population dynamics of mammals and their predators and the flow of substances and energy within ecosystems etc. Much research is carried out, not only on large mammals such as European bison, Grey wolf and Eurasian lynx, but also on the extremely species rich 98 Falinski, J.B. (1986). Vegetation dynamics in temperate lo wland primeval forest. Ecological studies in Bialowieza forest. Junk Publishers. 537 p. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 56 groups of rodents, bats and predators99. Large datasets are available on the natural fluctuating population sizes of many plant and animal species, supplying valuable information on population regulating factors and species inte ractions in forests un der non-intervention management100. There are five research institutions located in Bialowieza: Natural Forests Department of the Forest Resear ch Institute, Mammal Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Bialowieza Geobotanical Station of Warsaw University; Plant Demography Laboratory of the Institute of Botany of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and the Laboratory on the Ecology and Protection of Natural Habitats. Recently, Majella National Park (Italy) has started several monitoring projects on vegetation dynamics and wildlife species. At higher altitudes (above the treeline) monitoring will lead towards an up-to-date mapping of high elevation pastures in the core zone. The study on these high-elevation pastures is also addressed to gain knowledge of the potential nutritional value of the pastures for the wild ungulate species. There is no intention to intervene on the ongoing dynamics in the core zone of the park. The monitoring of the dynamics in the abandoned agricultural/grazing areas at lower altitudes, outside the core zone, is mainly focused on grasslands and shrubs and vegetation dynamics, i.e. forest/grassland cover. Chronologies from the 1950's to recent years will be compiled by comparing aerial pictures from different period s. Important habitat types include Semi-natural dry grasslands and scrublands (habitat type 6210), *Pseudo-steppe with grasses and annuals (habitat type 6220) and *Apennine be ech forests (habitat type 9210). Long-term monitoring programmes are also cond ucted for important wildlife species of the park such as Apennine Chamois, Grey Wolf, and Brown Bear. Despite the long tradition of forestry in Slovakia and detailed knowledge on forests the first mapping of primeval forests in the national le vel was undertaken only recently (within the project financially supported from the EEA/Norway grants in 2009-2010). The main results are the following: 332 mapped sites (53 699 ha) including 122 pristine forests (10 120 ha), 169 pristine forest remnants (1 527 ha) and 696 sites (14 235 ha) with the potential to become wild areas; preparing documentation to designate 5 the important sites as nature reserves; several activities to increase public awareness incl uding the case study on potential tourism in Carpathian primeval forests. Information is avai lable on www.pralesy.sk or may be provided by the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic\". Measure 8 : Educational and interpretation services fo r visitors, schools an d local communities It is important to generate public support for the enforcement of the management plan of each Natura 2000 site. The interpretation of conser vation goals is important for generating the necessary wider public support for biodiversity pr otection. It may help to increase the public knowledge about the whole network of Natura 2000. This measure can be implemented in relation to any habitat type and can benefit the protection of any species occurring in areas with a non-intervention management regime. 99 Jedrzejewska, B. & J.M.

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 57 As part of the comprehensive and concise non-intervention management approach Fulufj\u00e4llet National Park (Sweden) takes advantage of a natural disturbance event in G\u00f6ljadalen Valley as a unique interpretation site. During the 19 97 'centennial flood' approximately 10,000 cubic metres of trees were felled by flash flooding. The management of the nature reserve (status of the area at that time) decided to leave the large amount of wood untouched after the dramatic erosion that followed the extreme downpour. Today the site, covered with dead wood decaying naturally, is one of the biggest attractions of the national park, equipped with interpretation boards for visitors to learn about natural processes. The interpretation of natural values requires in novative solutions. One such example is from Archipelago National Park (Finland) where an underwater snorkelling trail was built following the results of a detailed study on mari ne biodiversity. The interpretation service must ensure that visitors, domestic and internationa l, receive a clear and simple message about the wilderness qualities of a protected area. Interp retation must be multilingual, based on an analysis of most frequent foreign visitors, and interactive. Visitor centres are only one way of communicating with visitors but there are other offline (information boards, leaflets) and online tools (see also paragraph 5.3). Enhancing the awareness of local communities and their sense of ownership is important. The sense of ownership is especially important when a new management approach is to be introduced. Fulfuj\u00e4llet National Park (Sweden) was the first national park in the Swedish protected area system where the new designation title (upgrading from nature reserve to national park) was introduced only after a consultative process with the local communities 101. The new designation resulted from a five-yea r process that involved a cooperation board including representatives of the relevant munici palities, local businesses, etc. The so-called Fulufjallsringen aimed to increase awareness ab out the future national park. In a so-called 'inside-out process', local people received suppo rt from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) and received information about ho w a national park could bring social economic and other benefits, thus making it a source of o pportunities rather than a source of restrictions. The focus was on how to obtain benefits from outside the borders of a national park rather than on the design inside the park. A vision emerged of a new visitor centre with local employees, new tourism facilities outside the park, and better infrastructure with improved roads and telecommunications. The \"loss\" was clear: a nati onal park would bring some restrictions. But now, at last, the gains were also clear: a new fu ture and opportunities fo r people to remain and find jobs in the area. Confidence replaced mistrust. This improved \"inside-out\" planning process created a basis for making the national pa rk a reality. Local resi dents accepted the new national park with a zonation which led to more restrictive land use, for instance limiting 'traditional activities' such as hunting or using snowmobiles. Measure 9 : Minimise illegal and unwanted human in tervention through law enforcement and providing a ranger service for strict protection zones 101 Wallsten, P. (2003). The \"Inside-Out\" process. A Key Approa ch for Establishing Fulufj\u00e4lle t National Park in Sweden. Mountain Research and Development 23: 227-229. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 58 There are great differences in the need for a measure to minimise illegal and unwanted human intervention in wilderness and wild areas. Visitor pressure, location of the site and effectiveness of the general law enforcement defines what kind of measure is needed. In certain regions, a ranger service may be essential in order to ensure the favourable degree of protection of the site but in other regions ranger services may be more focused on guiding and maintenance of visitor infrastructure. It is a decision of the manager to evaluate whether ranger service is needed or not. In Majella National Park (Italy), in cooperation with Corpo Forestale, a ranger service operates to guarantee law enforcement. The ra ngers also act as the representatives of the management authority in the local communities. Rangers in Majella National Park have a main role in controlling activities in forest areas. The continuous improvement of staff capacities is indispensable. A total of about 30 park em ployees (guards and other staff members) and volunteers participated in a course to achieve the licence of Volunteer Environmental Guard. 4.3 Management challenges Response to bark beetle calamities is a challeng e as it may cause economic losses in the forests surrounding wilderness. Forest laws often require managers to intervene even in nature protection areas where non-intervention is practiced. There is a clear difference between the northern and southern Member States regarding this problem. In Northern countries this is a hypothetical problem, whereas in more southern countries th is represents a management issue. However, scientific research strongly suggests that natural forests are more resilient to natural disturbances in general and that semi-natural and managed fo rests are more prone to extreme calamities. A non-intervention strategy often causes conflict during the bark beetle outbreaks (see paragraph 4.3.1). There is a clear difference between the northern and southern Member States in their relation to forest fires. There are fires launched in the Northe rn countries in order to imitate its effect on the habitats. However, wild fires represent a huge social and economic problem in the southern countries, creating a practical problem for wild erness managers (see pa ragraph 4.3.2). However studies show that natural forests ar e more resilient to forest fires 102. Reindeer herding by indigenous people is a specif ic challenge appearing in the northern countries. This herding is often seen as an activity that ha s minimal effect on the biological diversity of a protected area. Therefore it is suggested that wild erness can co-exist with reindeer herding in the northern countries (see paragraph 4.3.3). Despite being mentioned often as the biggest challenge for protected areas, climate change does not yet appear among the top problems recognis ed by the Natura 2000 managers applying a wilderness approach in the management of their sites. This might be due to the high resilience of the natural areas or lack of knowledge on the po tential and complex effects of the climate change process. 102 Proen\u00e7a, V., H.M. Pereira & L. Vicente (2010). Resistance to wildfire and early regeneration in natural broadleaved forest and pine plantation. Acta Oecologica 36: 626-633. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 59 Three potentially conflicting issues and best practice examples to solve them are addressed below i.e. bark beetle outbreaks mainly occurring in the Continental and the Alpine region in Central Europe, forest fires in Boreal and Mediterranean regions, and ma naging grazing pressure in the Boreal zone. 4.3.1 Bark beetles as key species in ar eas with non-intervention management In natural areas bark beetles are key species a ffecting forest dynamics. Bark beetles are small insects, about 2-6 mm long, depending on the spec ies. Examples are the European Spruce Bark Beetle ( Ips typographus ), the ). Some species kill trees. These beetles bore into mature trees and feed on the tissue that transports nutrients and water to the tree, thus interrupting the flow of water and killing the tree. Most, however, live in dead, weakened, or dying host trees. Bark beetles are usually present in forests in low nu mbers, often confined to single tree populations or small clusters of attacked trees widely scatte red across the landscape. Like many other insects, bark beetles emit pheromones to attract conspe cifics, which are thus drawn to trees already colonised by bark beetles. This can result in heav y infestations and eventually the death of the tree. In natural forests these outbreaks usually remain relatively small scale and die out after a couple of years, because dead trees are inhabited by insects antagonistic to cambio- and xylophages 103. Under certain semi-natural and managed conditions, however, they can develop large outbreaks that kill thousands of trees. This process of sporadic outbre aks is an integral constituent of natural forest ecosystems. Bark beetles are a natural disturbance agent that forests have coevolved with and a major force determining successional patterns and ecosystem dynamics. Bark beetles have a large ecologic al impact in forest ecosystems: they initialise decomposition of wood and ba rk for further breakdown by fungi and other microorganisms; numerous organisms inhabit bark beetle galleries, where they scavenge for food, hide, hibernate or reproduce. Resulting dead wood is the livelihood of various plants and animal species including endangered species protected by the Habitats Directive, for other animals: bark beetles and their larvae are parts of food webs; predators range from insects to birds such as woodpecker species; in natural forests generally weak trees are infested; dead trees allow light to pass down to the forest floor, enabling forest regeneration. Climate change prospects There is growing evidence that climate change will increase the potential for bark beetle outbreaks. Population models predict more generations of adul t beetles per year in ce rtain regions related to 103 Hilszcza ski, J.(2008). Bark of dead infected spruce trees as an overwintering site of insects predators associated with bark and wood boring beetles. Forest Research Papers 69: 15-19. 104 Nieto, A. & K.N.A. Alexander List of Saprox ylic Beetles. Luxe mbourg: Publications Office of the European Union. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 60 higher mean annual temperatures. Moreover, some bark beetle species migrate to higher altitudes and settle where they would not have been able to survive previously. Therefore bark beetles will gain further importance in mounta inous and northern areas as well105. Best practice: buffer zones When forests are varied in age and structure, such as primeval forest, they are much more likely to be able to withstand a bark beetle attack. Plante d mono-species, single-aged stands are much more vulnerable. Environmental factors, particularly drought, can weaken whole stands, making a large number of trees vulnerable for infe station by bark beetles. Massive reproduction of bark beetles in non-intervention zones may nevertheless occur, pa rticularly in previously managed forests which are by non-intervention management in transition towards more close-to-nature forests. In order to protect the stands adjacent to the ar eas where non-intervention is practiced, classic forest protection measures against bark beetles n eed to be applied in buffer zones which are under active nature protection 106. There are effective measures which do not require the use of insecticides, as use of insecticides might have unexpected consequences to other species and the ecosystem. The creation of a buffer zone of at least 300 m broad outside the non-intervention area is recommended. Recent studies in Germany have proved that 95% of spreading bark beetles settle on new host trees within an area of 300 m 107. Additionally, controlled trapping of bark beetles in the buffer zone by trap trees (trees which are arti ficially weakened) can be a measure to prevent spreading to adjacent managed forest stands. Regular monitoring of infested trees by bark beetles in the outer zone of wilderness areas is a good practice. The management of wilderness areas should work together with landowners of adjacent areas to control infestations from spreading to ad jacent forests. Infested trees may be removed in localised areas along the park boundary upon request by adjacent landowners. Only beetle-infested trees near to the park boundary would be considered for removal in the first stage of infesting. Removing trees killed by bark beetle and debark ing of stumps during autumn and winter could have negative effects on insect predators overwi ntering in bark under the snow level. Moreover spruces primarily infested by bark beetle might later be colonised by protected cambiophage beetles 108. This means creating a buffer zone between the non-intervention zone and the surrounding territories open for fore stry activities. The creation of such a buffer helps to reduce the conflict opportunities with forest owners. Bark beetles as a political issue in non-intervention areas: the example of Bavarian Forest National Park 105 J\u00f6nsson, A.M., S. Harding, P. Krokene, H. Lange, A. Okland, H.P. Ravn & L.M. Schroeder (2011). Modelling the potential impact of global warming on Ips typographus voltinism and reproduc tive diapause. Grodzki, W. & R. Jakus (2009). Management of bark beetle outbreaks. In: Europe's Wild Heart. Conference Report, http://www.wildnisgebiet.at/en/proj of dead infected spruce trees as an overwintering site of insects predators associated with bark and wood boring beetles. Forest Research Papers, 69:15-19. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 61 Bark beetle outbreaks often lead to controversy in the public opinion on forest management as shown by the well-documented example of the Bavarian National Forest109. After the major wind throw events in the 1980s, the management of the Bavarian Forest National Park adopted a new conservation policy, i.e. non-intervention in th e core zone of the national park. While the bark beetle was still controlled through regular screen ing of stands and immediate sanitary logging of infested trees in the management zone, 'leaving nature to its own devices' became the management policy for the core zone. As a consequence of this new policy, the wind throw stems were not removed from the forest and the coarse woody debr is provided favourable breeding habitat for the spruce bark beetle ( I. typographus ). Above-average seasonal temperatures and a series of severe wind throw events facilitated the spread of the bark beetle between 1990 and 2000, leading to a massive re production during which trees on an area of more than 6,000 ha were killed - more than a quarter of the park's total area of 24,250 ha. Whereas the disturbance itself was considered natural, its scale and velocity were at least partly human-induced, because of the larg e scale presence of plantations. Additionally, climate change increased the incidence of hot and dry summers that affect tree vitality and milder winters reduced beetle mortality. The major change in the visual appearance of th e post-disturbance landscape stirred widespread public resentment among resi dents in the Bavarian Forest 110. Significant parts of the population pressed for actions to control bark beetle outbreak s. This example shows that landscape change as a consequence of non-intervention management lead ing to natural disturbances, such as caused by massive bark beetle outbreaks, is not only an ec ological issue, but also a cultural and political issue110. A good communication plan is indispensable to inform local communities, tourists and the broad public on the ecological significance of cycl ic outbreaks of bark beetles and how these fit in the non-intervention management strategy. Finally, as explained in Section 4.2.2, it should be recalled that, in the case of outbreaks of pathogens alien to European habitats (origin from outside Europe), regulated by the EU plant health legislation, immediate intervention may be necessary to eradicate them. Non-intervention would result in the establishment of those pests, which could cause irreversible and unacceptable damage to Europe's tree species in long term. Forest ecosystem resilience The available scientific evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the capacity of forests to resist change, or recover following disturbance, is dependent on biodiversity at multip le scales. Maintaining and rest oring biodiversity in forests promotes their resilience to human-induced pressures and is th erefore an essential 'insurance policy' and safeguard against expected climate change impacts. The resilience of a forest ecosystem to changing environmental conditions is determined by its biological and ecological resources, in particular (i) the diversity of specie s, including micro-organisms, (ii) the gen etic variability within species (i.e., the diversit y of genetic traits within populations of species), and (iii) the regional pool o f species and ecosystems. Resilience is also influenced by the size of forest ecosystems (generally, the larger and less fragmented, the better), and by the condit ion and character of the surrounding landscape. It is known that e.g. primary forests are generally more resilient (and stable, resistant, and adaptive) than modified na tural forests or plantations. 109 M\u00fcller, M. (2011).

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 62 Therefore, policies and measures that promote their protecti on yield both biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation benefits, in addition to a full array of ecosystem services111. 4.3.2 Forest fires in Boreal and Mediterranean forests Forest fires are a threat for the forest and natu ral areas in Europe. Over 65 000 fires take place every year in the European Union, burning, on average, half a million hectares of the European landscape. Economic losses due to forest fires in the European Union territory are estimated in over 2 billion Euros every year. Areas protected un der the Natura 2000 scheme are no exception to the damage caused by forest fires. Every year , approximately 80 000 ha are burned within the Natura 2000 sites. 112 At the same time, in many ecosystems fire is a natural process and an important disturbance factor that essentially contributes to ecosystem processes. At the landscape level, wild fires create diversity in stand structure, thereby increasing the variety of habitats. Moreover, wild fires have a role in maintaining the vital habitat for species dependent on burned and decaying wood, such as saproxylic beetles. Taking into account the large areas affected, in particular in the Mediterranean region, and the associated environmental and economic losses, wild fire is prevented and extinguished. In most northern European countries wildfi res are almost completely eradicated as a result of the extremely efficient fire suppression systems. After a long suppression period fire is now again reintroduced there at certain places, by using controlled burning. Boreal forests: reburn ing as best practice Under natural conditions, wild fires ignited by ligh tning occur in boreal fo rests approximately once in every 50 years on dry soil conditions, and once in every 100-150 years on moist sites or even 200 years on wet soils. It helps the shifting between successional stages and increases biodiversity at the landscape scale. In most boreal forests, fire su ppression is still an important ma nagement aim often prescribed by national law. Fire suppression is not restricted on ly to the managed production forests but fires are eliminated also from the forest conservation areas. As a consequence, forest dwelling species that are dependent on fires or on the ecological pattern s and forest structures created by fires may not find suitable habitats in the protected forest area s. These observations have led to major efforts in Fennoscandia recently that aim to restore fire in these ecosystems 113. Not only the pyrophilous species but also hundreds of other species, in particular those dependent on dead wood, benefit from burning. Reburning also prevents the long term accumulation of 'fuel load', which otherwise 111 Thompson, I., B. Mackey, S. McNulty & A. Mosseler (2009). Forest Resilience, Biodiversity, and Climate Change.

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 63 would lead to unnatural large-scaled, very intense fires with a large impact on regeneration of the ecosystem. Interactions with bark beetle outbreaks Although major disturbances in forest ecosystems su ch as fire or insect outbreaks may appear to be independent events, they are often causally relate d. Such interactions certainly occur in many northern and boreal forest ecosystems. There is increasing recognition that fire suppression or control policies substantially alte r forest composition, structure, and vulnerability to damaging insect pests113. This may be due to the effects of fire suppression resulting in higher tree densities and a more suitable distribution of large diameter trees114. On the other hand, increased amounts of host material (slash and stumps) in burned stands can also attract bark beetles. The interaction of bark beetles, fuels and fire in forest systems, is inherently complex and much remains unknown114. Mediterranean forests and shrublands Fire is a key factor in Mediterra nean forests and open and closed shrublands (garrigue and maquis, respectively). Shrublands in part icular, are the land cover most prone to fire. Forests are usually less susceptible than shrublands. Summer fires occur frequently leading to vegetation composed of a mosaic of recently burned, re generated secondary vegetation an d unburned areas. Most fires (>98%) are started by man115, either planned or accidentally. Consequently, the fire-interval is shortened to about five years in many areas. The European Forest Fi re Information System (EFFIS) supports the services in charge of the protec tion of forests against fires in the EU countries and provides with updated and reliable informatio n on forest fires in Eu rope. Rural development policy contributes to restoring fo restry production potential damage d by natural disasters and fire and introducing appropriate prevention instruments. Fire spread rate is facilitated or retarded by la ndscape heterogeneity. Therefore, the spatial pattern of fire ignition and spread across landscapes is affe cted by fire proneness, i.e. the differential fire behaviour in various land cover types, such as vegetation composition and heterogeneity that are not equally fire prone116. Studies in Portugal suggest that ma ture forests of broadleaved deciduous and mixed forests generally have a low fire haza rd compared to pure pine forests, eucalypt plantations, or mixed pi ne and eucalyptus stands116. In general, native (evergreen) mixed broadleaved forests (often dominated by Quercus spp.) have a higher resistance and are more resilient to fire, compared to planted coniferous forests (often dominated by Pinus spp.)117. Consequently, fire spreads more slowly and burn s with less intensity and severity in natural broadleaved forests. There is evidence that mature evergreen oak forests can even become 'self-protective' against wildfires, to the point of fire self-extinction 118. 114 Jenkins, M.J., E. Hebertson, W. Page & C.A.

EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 64 Best practice: promoting native species to reduce fire risks Restoration management aiming to restore natu ral mixed broadleaved forests is a successful strategy to reduce fire ri sks in Mediterranean regions117. Transition of planted coniferous forests, which are very sensitive to hot and intense fires, to more natural more fire resistant, mixed broadleaved forests decreases the chance for larg e-scale forest fires. In wild areas, natural succession can be used where site conditions enable it to promote a mixture of species and to favour mature stages. This naturally slow process can be somewhat speeded up with some selective thinning favouring broadleaved species. During the tr ansition period, intense fire prevention is still needed. 4.3.3 Reindeer herding and wilderne ss management: seeking the balance Reindeer herding as cultural heritage Wild reindeer have lived in the Nordic region for more than 10, 000 years, since the end of the Ice Age. In Northern Scandinavia an d Northern Finland do mesticated or semi-domesticated reindeer have been herded by the S\u00e1mi people since the 9th century, or even earlier. Intensive reindeer herding has been practiced for more than 100 year s and the number of reindeers has doubled since the 1970's 119. Reindeer are today grazed in the northern regions of Norway, Sweden and Finland on natural pastures located mainly in forests and on treeless fells. Reindeer herding by the indigenous S\u00e1mi people in the northern part of Fennoscandia and Russia represents a cultural heritage value of natural areas in these regions. However in many areas, overgrazing by reindeer is regarded as a threat in several strictly protected areas, including some wilderness reserves 120. Local S\u00e1mi reindeer herders often find themselves caught between the expectation placed upon them by the majority of society to engage in en vironmentally friendly re indeer herding, and the existing requirement to engage in rational reindeer herding 121. The Finnish Act on Wilderness Reserves (1991) brought a new perspective on the management and traditional forms of use of northern wild nature. It prohibited heavy development that would change nature significantly, yet it aimed at impr oving possibilities for traditional uses of nature. Therefore, reindeer herding is seen as a lega l form of land use in wilderness areas. The management objectives of many protected areas ar e to preserve the pristine character of these areas, and to protect the S\u00e1mi culture and their traditional subsistence uses. The impact of overgrazing Northern fell biotopes are particularly sensitive to intense grazing, since they are characterised by harsh climatic conditions, thin soils, slow soil formation, intense erosion by wind and water, low 119 Suominen, O. & J. Olofsson (2000). Impacts of semi-d omesticated reindeer on structure of tundra and forest review. Mets\u00e4hallitus, Finland. http://www.metsa.fi/sivustot/metsa/SiteAttachments/a147liitteetpdf.pdf ). 121 Dahlstr\u00f6m, A.N. (2003). Negotiating a Cult ural Landscape: Predators & S\u00e1mi Reindeer Herding in the Laponian World Heritage Area. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 65 vegetation productivity rates, and in many places also steeply sloping terrain. Problems arise when the semi-domesticated reindeer herds become overab undant. The impact of grazing is clear but its importance and the optimal amount of reindeers are still disputed119. Overgrazing leads ultimately to the degradation of lichen-dominated habitats and leads to an increase in the uniformity of vegetation and a decrease in biodiversity 122. Alternating periods of intense and light grazing together with moderate trampling create the best conditions for many characteristic plant species of these habitats, as long as periods of intense gr azing are not too long. In winter, grazing reindeer primarily rely on easily digestible lichens, gra sses and dwarf shrubs for foraging, while in summer they feed more on forbs and leaves. Overgrazing resu lts in the spread of plants avoided by reindeer due to their indigestibility, such as tough grasse s, forbs, sedges and mosses. If the animals cannot move to new pastures, these plants will also be eaten, leaving patches of land devoid of vegetation and vulnerable to erosion. Pastures are generally able to recover fairly rapidly when grazing pressure decreases, except for lichen past ures, which only regenerate very slowly. The sizes of reindeer herds were formerly limited mainly by we ather conditions and the carrying capacity of the pastures used for winter grazing. During periods with heav y snow cover, reindeer may starve when lichen become inaccessible. Some herders in Finland today put out silage and hay for their reindeer herds. Such winter feeding an d the medication of reindeer against parasites enable herders in many regions to keep larger herds than natural pastures could sustain. The erection of fences to limit the movements of reindeer has also resulted in local overgrazing. Reindeer herding is one of the oldest traditional li velihoods of the peoples of the Nordic region, and its survival is necessary to preserve an essential part of the cultural heritage. But it remains vital to harmonise both reindeer herding with nature conservation. Reducing the numbers of grazing animals is a social issue that directly affects th e livelihoods of herders and farmers. If pastoral farming and the numbers of grazing animals need to be reduced significantly, society could provide alternative sources of income for such groups 123. Best practice example from Oulanka National Park (Finland) The overall objective of non-intervention management in Oulanka National Park is the maintenance and preservation of biodiversity and natural ecological processes. This should be combined with ecologically sustainable reindeer herding. Reindeer herding is allowed in the national park and necessary work connected to the herding is possibl e regardless of the restrictions. For example, the use of snowmobiles is permitted when needed. The management of the national park cooperates with herding associations to avoid possible conflicts between herding and conservation or other interests such as recreation and nature-oriented tourism. Large herbivores are integral part of the taiga ecosystem. Before the reindeer husbandry was introduced, the Oulanka National Park was popu lated by wild forest reindeer. Nowadays, the reintroduction of wild forest reindeer is impossible due to interbreeding with semi-domesticated reindeer. Moreover, the size of Oulanka National Park is too small to support a natural population of wild forest reindeer. 122 Olofsson, J., H. Kitti, O. Rautiainen, S. Stark & L. Oksanen (2001). Effect of summer grazin g by reindeer on composition of vegetation, productivity and nutrient cycling. Ecography 24: 13-24. 123 www.environment.fi/nordicnature > Fact sheets > Reindeer and sheep grazing EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 66 The management of the Oulanka National Park coop erates with local reindeer herding associations to regulate the presence of reindeer in the park's core zone. The long term aim of the management is to stabilise the grazing pressure of reindeer in the core zone and to reflect the natural situation as much as possible. The park management will estimate the desired level of grazing based on best knowledge and habitat mapping. This requires close cooperation with research institutes. The park management developed a programme to monitor the e ffects of a decrease in the grazing pressure of the reindeer. 4.4 Concluding remarks While wilderness and wild areas are not explicitly mentioned in the EU Birds and Habitats Directives and would not be necessary or required in many Natura 2000 sites, there are particular cases where management aiming at the preservation and restoration of wilderness qualities can be compatible with the objectives of the EU nature le gislation or even necessary to maintain or restore a favourable conservation status of several specie s and habitats of European importance. In those cases, the following conclusions and recommendations can be made: 1. Wilderness qualities make ecosystems resilien t against most of the important pressures affecting biodiversity and help achieving favour able conservation status of many species and habitats of Community interest. 2. The most appropriate management for Natura 2000 sites should be developed in view of the general objective to ensure a favourable co nservation status of the species and habitats for which the sites have been designated. I.e. identifying workable targets for wilderness maintenance or restoration measures, which are designed and devised to bolster natural processes, must take into account the cont ext in which many Natura 2000 sites exist. 3. Non-intervention management implies that dynamic processes leading to habitat changes will occur. These should be monitored and management adapted accordingly. 4. Non-intervention management can be relevant for various habitat groups listed in the Habitats Directive Annex I. Along with several forest habitats; a non-intervention management approach can be applied to cert ain open habitats such as temperate heath and scrub, natural grassland formation habitats and bogs, fens and mires. 5. Besides preserving ecological values and conserving biodiversity, wilderness areas offer the opportunity to learn about natural ecosystem dynamics, and offer a venue for visitors to gain first-hand experience about natural proc esses and experience the spiritual values of these places. 6. Wilderness areas provide reference areas for human influenced areas. They represent open air laboratories for natural dynamics. 7. Establishing the regime and suit able management within Natura 2000 sites is only the first step when protecting the qualities of wild erness. The management authorities should consider the larger scale outside the manage d areas. There are effects from outside the Natura 2000 sites, influencin g the wilderness qualities. 8. Nature conservation and ecological requirem ents of conservation objectives sometimes conflict with other land management. This conflict may require input from the Natura 2000 site managers and practical solutions ca n usually be found. Restoration measures involve making management choices that enable natural processes to become re-established and that, in turn, involves taking management actions to support them. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 67 9. The management authorities should always keep in mind the existence and relevant elements of the European and national anim al and plant health and plant reproductive materials' regimes and related ar eas (e.g. rules for the handling of animal by-products), as well as closely cooperate with the comp etent authorities implementing those. EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 68 5 Communication strategies In relation to the management of wilderness and wild areas, stakeholder involvement is a key- element. A sense of 'ownership' is very important fo r good cooperation with local stakeholders. It is essential to work with different stakeholder groups and embrace their contributions to the site. Different communication and promotional strategies are needed for different target groups, i.e. local stakeholders, decision and policy makers and visitors/tourists. Much of the restoration effort within Natura 2000 sites must also involve (re-)building relationships with peop le, either living in, working on or visiting the site and communicating the merits and purposes of non-intervention management and restoration/re-wilding management. 5.1 Involvement of stakeholders It is very important that the management auth ority of a wilderness and wild area ensures stakeholder involvement in relation to the mana gement of the area. The better the cooperation with local stakeholders, the easier it will be to implement wilderness protection measures. A way to organise this is to make delegates of the most relevant stakeholder-groups members of a local consulting body. The managing authority should regularly explain and discuss all aspects of non-intervention or restoration management with thes e stakeholders. Best practices show that this method of cooperation can be very successful. It is very important that stakeholders have a sense of 'ownership' of the wilderness or wild area. Main stakeholders groups might include: land managers/land owners (state and private); local officials, such as provincial government and municipalities; local communities; local businesses; organisations regions); external land users (i.e. visitors, climbers, bird watchers); national, regional or local nature conservation NGOs; agriculture, forestry, fisheries, extractive industry and interest groups and businesses; European bodies supporting and prom oting non-intervention management; national central and local animal and plan t health and plant reproductive material competent authorities 5.2 Importance of effective communication As a policy, Natura 2000 is about protecting natu re with people, i.e. people are specifically expected to be integrated and involved in the management processes. Similarly, restoration approaches for wilderness are obvio usly confronted by the fact that many Natura 2000 sites occur within areas, which are densely populate d and often have multiple human uses. Local people with a close association with an area , may struggle with concepts of 'wilderness' and may even perceive it as being 'dangerous' or 'out of control'. A main concern is often that EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 69 restoration to enable natural processes to become more dominant on a site may close their access to nature: they may associate non-intervention strategies as lack of management and even neglect. Some may think of wild areas as being less valuable, non-productive and 'less useful' for man. Local people may actually prefer to live in a traditiona l, agricultural, rural landscape: for them, basically, re-wilding can appear to involve the gradual destru ction of nature or land as it is left-over to natural processes. They do not see a steady progression of improvement for nature and land, but rather a loss of what is familiar, known and 'saf e'. Incentive and compensation measures can be used to overcome limitations of non-intervention management for local communities. It is essential to work with farmers, landowners, community-based volunteers, bird-watchers, cyclists, walkers and the wider public and embrace their contributions to each site, whether that be in pursuit of economic gain, leisure, enjoyment of nature or realisation of biodiversity priorities. The important aspect here is that the legal prot ection afforded through being designated as a Natura 2000 site, often also embodied as part of lo cal or national protection scheme, is designed to improve ecological, social and econ omic sustainability. Natura 2000 is not a barrier to activities, which also respect and protect an ar ea's natural resources. In fact, it can be a significant supporting resource to address and resolve tensions. 5.3 Communication strategies and actions Different communication strategies are needed for different target groups (i.e. local stakeholders, decision and policy makers and visitors/tourists ). Different stakeholder groups have different interests. Several recommendations can be made about communi cation strategies based on best practices: A good communication plan is indispensable to explain how important natural disturbance events are for non-intervention manage ment and biodiversity conservation. A clear 'wilderness' message is needed, includ ing a clear definition of wilderness, and an explanation of the ecological and socio-cultural benefits. It is important to improve the ecological awareness of local communities through meetings, publications, educational events and presence in media. Management bodies should be as transp arent as possible about their management approach and should share monitoring results with the broad public. In cases of conflicts with certain stakeholde rs, management bodies should be patient and persistent in their strategic management, as many set goals will only arise on the long term in these kinds of areas. Cooperation with local businesses. If businesses have an ownership feeling towards the nature value, they are willing to contribute towards its preservation. The challenge here is to find sufficient resources to involve the local businesses and create benefits for them. A marketing strategy might be effective in supporting wilderness areas. Promotion of (eco)tourism is an important element of this. Helpful tools include: Sponsoring will promote the area and will create the necessary financial support. Visitor centres are excellent places to promote and communicate non-intervention or restoration management to a broad public in the form of permanent or special/thematic EU Guidance on the management of wilderness and wild areas in Natura 2000 70 exhibitions. They are often good starting points for excursions, led by a well-trained dedicated staff of rangers. Development and promotion of tourism products: programmes to promote an area as a tourism destination and to coordinate and initiate development projects, sometimes financed through European Union funding. Website : every wilderness or wild area should have a well-designed website with opportunities for interactive participation (forum pages). Publication materials : Publishing scientific and public documents and brochures about interesting or new developments in the area, such as major disturbing events and their consequences, or the newly establishment of important and endangered species.

Within the concept of stability there are a number of terms and types that warrant further discussions. Generally ecologists have included the concepts of resilience and resistance of communities within the concept of stability. In this case resilience is the speed with which a community can return to its original state afte r being perturbed and resistance is the ability to avoid the perturbation in the first place (See ' ecosystem resilience '). These ideas are now generally subsumed with the definition of ecosystem resilience. Begon, M., Harper, J.L., and Townsend, C.R. 1996. Ecology: individuals, populations and communities (3rd ed.).

The ecosystem boundaries are irrespective of scale or location for ecosystem processes occur at a multitude of scales. Generally ecologists take a pragmatic approach that looks for assemblages of strong links between components within an ecosystem compared to weak interactions with components outside them. As biological diversity relates to the sum of the variability within species (e.g. genetic), between species and between ecosystems, it can be seen as a key structural feature of ecosystems Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) (Article 2) (http://www.biodiv.org/convention/articles.shtml?lg =0&a=cbd-02 ) Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA). 2005.

(http://www.maweb.org/en/index.aspx ) ecosystem functions / functioning Ecosystem functions are de fined as the capacity of natural [ecosystem] processes and components to provide goods and services that satisfy human needs, directly or indirectly. These functions have been broadly grouped into four categories: 1) regulation, 2) habitat, 3) production and 4) information (de Groot et al . 2002). In short, ecosystem functions can be seen as an observable ou tcome (a subset) of ecosystem processes and ecosystem structure . Out of the group of ecosystem functions, a set of ecosystem services having visible benefits to human society can be identified. De Groot, R.S., Wilson, M.A., Boumans, R.M.J. 2002.

In community ecology, disturbance generally relates to the interruption of, or interference with, interspecific competition and the settled state the community structure would assume if the conditions remained constant. Therefore a disturbance is a discrete event in time that removes organisms or otherwise disrupts the community by influencing the availability of space and/or food resources, or by changing the physical environment. A general consequence of this is that space or resources become available to new individuals. The most commonly identified causes of disturbance are predators, parasites, disease, temp oral heterogeneity and changes to physical structures. Changes to each of these factors can be naturally occurring or anthropogenically induced (Begon et al. 1996). Kaufmann, M. R., Graham, R. T., Boyce, D. A., Jr., Moir, W. H., Perry, L., Reynol ds, R.

The ecological functions of corridors are to enable species dispersal, migration, foraging and reproduction. Individual corridors are not necessarily linear features, but can be grouped in several ways according to their shapes (diffuse, belt-like, line-like, etc.), structure (continuous or interrupted like stepping stones), spatial position to the core area (conjunctive corridor or blind corridors), or by their services like migration corridors, commuting corridors and dispersal corridors. In practice, ecological corridors can be established at different scales, e.g. regional, national or local. At regional and national level ecological corridors refer to continuous habitat stretches (such as river valleys and water courses) and/or mosaic of habitat types that allow movement of species within the landscape. At local level corridors can consist of landscape elements such as hedgerows, dikes and road verges. It is to be noted that the proper scale of implementation is to a large extent species dependent and these aspects should be, therefore, taken into consideration.Conservation and Sustainable Use: Lessons Learned From Ecological Networks.

Three major dimensions of vulnerability are involved: exposure to stresses, perturbations, and shocks; the sensitivity of people , places, ecosystems, and species to the stress or perturbation, including their capacity to anticipate and cope with the stress; and the resilience of the exposed people, places, ecosystems, and species in terms of their capacity to absorb shocks and perturbations while maintaining functi on. In the context of climate change: The degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.
