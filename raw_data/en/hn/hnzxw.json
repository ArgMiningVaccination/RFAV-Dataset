I'm an alchemist at heart and resonate with the Shamanic piece of Classical Chinese Medicine. What does that mean? It means I combine my spiritual sight and intuition to guide me as I hold sacred space for your own innate wisdom to rise up. I believe ultimately that healing comes from within you. My foundation is rooted in the rigorous academics of Chinese Medical School. At the same time, I am guided by the wisdom of my heart and higher self. I also trust your inner wisdom, your guides and your intuition. I am a weaver of Peruvian Shamanism and Classical Chinese Medicine. I enjoy working with people involved with deep plant medicine ceremonial work. I specialize in preparing the mind, body, and spirit before ceremony as well as with the integration afterwards. The sessions are typically 90-minutes which we will spend exploring deeper into your mystical realms. A session plan will be co-created depending on your individual needs and intentions... Modalities include: Acupuncture, Limpia- (clearing heavy energy), Sound Healing, Guided Meditation, Soul Journeying and Retrieval, Energy Balancing, Stone Medicine, and Bodywork.
