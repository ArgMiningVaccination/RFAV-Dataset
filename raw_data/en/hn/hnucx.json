Homeopathy is a gentle, deep acting therapeutic system which considers the whole person: physically, emotionally and mentally. Prescribing is based on all aspects of a patient's health condition, personality and lifestyle. Every case is treated differently and no two patients are alike - even if they have the same diagnosis of illness. A complete medical system In homeopathy we understand the symptoms of an illness as the attempt of our immune system to overcome a disturbance of our health. Working on the principle 'Curentur Similia Similibus', which means 'like treats like', the homeopath will try to find a remedy which matches the symptoms of the patient as close as possible. A dose of this remedy will quickly bring relief and give the right impetus to the self-healing powers of the organism; the curative action will start and healing takes place from within the body. The immune system is strengthened and the body returns to a state of health. Is Homeopathy safe? Homeopathic remedies are drawn from natural substances including from plants, minerals and animals. Regulated homeopathic pharmacies prepare the remedies from minute amounts of the raw extracts, which are then repeatedly diluted and potentised. This method guarantees that the remedies are safe, non-toxic and non-addictive. They can be prescribed to all age groups, including babies and during pregnancy. Homeopathy can be safely used alongside drugs prescribed by your doctor and will not interfere with their action. Contact "}
