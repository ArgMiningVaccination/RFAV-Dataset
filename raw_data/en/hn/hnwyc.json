This report strives to provide a comprehensive view of the key milestones achieved by the agency and important activities undertaken by its staff throughout the year in pursuance of accomplishing its mandate, the thrust of which is embodied in its mission statement; forging strategic alliance with its stakeholders and working towards safeguarding and improving the health of the nation by ensuring pharmaceutical products marketed in the country are safe, efficacious and of quality. Thus it is with pleasure that I present to you once again, on behalf of the NPCB, the Annual Report for 2010. The year 2010 was indeed an eventful year for the NPCB. The Honourable Minister of Health Malaysia, Y.B. Dato' Sri Liow Tiong Lai paid a visit to the organisation and witnessed firsthand the workings of various departments under the jurisdiction of the organisation. NPCB also played host to a number of important regulatory events both international and regional, in addition to numerous seminars and training sessions conducted locally throughout the year. Malaysia was chosen as the venue by the Europe based Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) for its Annual General Meeting and its related seminar on traditional / herbal medicine products. This prestigious event was attended by representatives from some 36 countries including member countries of PIC/S and also non-member countries from the ASEAN region. Additionally, a Joint Meeting on Antimalarial Fixed Dose Combination of Artesunate-Mefloquine for the ASEAN region held in Kuala Lumpur was another occasion where countries came together to forge harmonised policies on regulatory matters that will ensure expeditious access to medicines used for neglected diseases. Pharmaceutical regulatory agencies, like any other regulatory bodies inevitably must rely on scientific and technological inputs and breakthroughs to maintain their dynamism and relevance. Towards this end, NPCB has embarked on a major review of the existing Drug Registration Guideline which on completion will see a more user friendly document that defines policies in an unequivocal manner and incorporate changes that are updated and in line with evolving international standards. Another milestone in its achievement is the promulgation of guidelines for the registration of homeopathic products, the result years of work and in collaboration with the Malaysian Homeopathic Medical Council. The department' s client' s charter too has undergone some significant changes with the focus on reduced timeline for registration and licensing activities, the result of efforts to reengineer some of the regulatori.procedures involved coupled with some important changes within the department itself. Among the quality initiatives, apart from maintaining its quality management system MS ISO 9001:2008, the organisation also successfully underwent full accreditation for MS ISO / IEC 17025 by the Department of Standards Malaysia under the Malaysian Laboratory Scheme. The Centre for Quality Control is currently working on extending the accredited tests to cover a broader range of chemical and microbiological testings. The NPCB, aware of its commitments and obligations to its international and regional partners, continues to engage them positively to foster cooperation and collaboration in regulatory matters. As a World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for regulatory control of pharmaceuticals since 1996, NPCB has continued to play an important role in the capacity building of the regulatory staff of WHO member countries as it benefits from the interactions with these countries. The organisation is also working towards becoming a non-OECD member complying with the Mutual Acceptance Data System of OECD Good Laboratory Practice, the adherence to which is expected to have far reaching effects to pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry conducting non clinical studies in the country. Regionally, NPCB plays a very active role in ASEAN meetings by way of its involvement in the various product working groups. To conclude, I would like take this opportunity to thank the NPCB staff for their tireless effort and dedication in continuing to provide quality service to all the stakeholders. Many of the accomplishments and achievements would not have been possible without the collective teamwork and a deep sense of appreciation of the challenges that lines the regulatory arena.6 Biro Right Timbalan Pengarah Pusat Pendaftaran Produk Deputy Director of Aida Abdullah Timbalan Pengarah Pusat Komplians dan Pelesenan Deputy Director of Centre for Compliance and Licensing Mr. Sulaiman Haji Ahmad Pengarah Regulatori Farmasi Pembangunan Organisasi Deputy Director Tan Ann Ling Timbalan Pengarah Pusat Kawalan Kualiti Deputy Director Timbalan Pengarah Ms. Sameerah Shaikh Abd.

Products that require registration are classified under one of the following categories: New Chemical Entities (NCE), Biotechnology, prescription, non-prescription, health supplement, natural (traditional) or veterinary products. Product registration is done online through a registration system known as QUEST 3 which is available to the applicants at any time. QUEST 3 is an upgraded version of the previously used QUEST 2 system. Besides maintaining the existing modules, several new modules have been introduced in order to improve and further enhance the registration processes. The module on product classification, modules pertaining to enforcement activities and the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) evaluation module are among the new modules. This system is continuously being upgraded in order to facilitate product registration for the ease of the user. 2.0 OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this centre is to ensure that pharmaceutical products are evaluated for its safety, efficacy and quality whereas natural (traditional) products are evaluated for its safety and quality features prior to being registered by the Drug Control Authority. This centre also provides administrative and technical assistance to various stakeholders in matters pertaining to product registration. 3.0 OTHER ACTIVITIES Besides handling product registration, this Centre also provides several other services such as: Issuing the Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CPP) for export purposes Authorizing changes made to the Marketing Authorization Holder Renewal of the Product Registration CertificatePUSAT PENDAFTARAN PRODUK CENTRE FOR PRODUCT Verifying requests made by the Pharmacy Enforcement Division regarding the registration status of products that are suspected of violating the law 4.0 ACHIEVEMENTS Applications Received There was a decline in the number of applications received from 2006 to 2010 for product registration (as in Figure 1). The most significant decline can be observed in 2010 with a reduction of 55.3% as compared to the previous year. This decline could be attributed to the QUEST 3 system whereby only applications approved through the initial screening process could proceed for further evaluation. This screening process mainly verifies that there is no banned ingredient in the formulation, the manufacturer has a valid manufacturing licence and a valid certificate of free sale where applicable. The cumulative number of applications received was 70,819 including those applications received for the registration of veterinary products. The registration and licensing of veterinary products commenced in August 2007. Until 2010, the total number of applications received for veterinary products was 2,806. (312 applications in 2010). Registered Products The decline in the number of applications received was subsequently reflected in the decline of the number of products approved for registration. Figure 2 shows that there was not much variation in the number of products registered each year (2006-2010) for prescription and non-prescription products. However , there was a fluctuation in the number of traditional products registered which was determined by the number of applications received. In 2010, for the first time, 54 veterinary products were approved for registration. The total cumulative figure for products registered until 2010 was 43,814 products (Figure 2).22 Produk Didaftar, 2006-2010 2 : Cumulative Number of Products Registered and Number of Products Preskripsi Non-prescription Semulajadi for Product Registration, 2006-201023 PRODUCT NAME Bridion 100 mg/ml Solutuion for 2 Effient Film- coated Tablets 10 mg Effient Film- coated Tablets mg 3 Prolonged Release Suspension for Intramuscular InjectionInvega Sustenna 150 mg Prolonged Release Suspension for Intramuscular InjectionInvega Sustenna 25 mg Prolonged Release Suspension for Intramuscular InjectionInvega Sustenna 50 mg Prolonged Release Suspension for Intramuscular InjectionInvega Sustenna 75 mg Prolonged Release Suspension for Intramuscular Injection 6 Multaq 400 mg Film coated tablets 7 Omnaris Nasal Spray 50 mcg ( powder hard capsule 9 Onglyza Tablet 2.5 mgOnglyza Tablet 5 mg 10 Priligy 30 mg Film- coated TabletsPriligy 60 mg Film- coated Tablets 11 Qlaira Film - coated Tablet 12 Revolate TM Film coated Tablet 25g RevolateTM Film coated Tablet 50 mg 13 Rnevela ( Sevelamer Carbonate) tablet 800 mg 14 Sifrol Extended Release tablet 0.375 mgSifrol Extended Release tablet 0.75 mgSifrol Extended Release tablet 1.5 mg 15 Thado capsule 50 mg 16 Toviaz 4 mg prolonged release tabletsToviaz 8 mg prolonged release tablets 17 Vidaza powder for suspension for Injection 100 mg/vial 18 Volibris 10 mg Film coated TabletVolibris 5 mg Film coated Tablet 19 Votrient film coated tablet 200 mgVotrient film coated tablet 400 mg 20 Zolinza 100 mg capsule20 New Chemical Entity (NCE) products (Table 1) and 18 biotechnology products (Table 2) were respectively approved by the DCA in 2010. 1: New chemical entity (NCE) pr oducts approved by the DCA in BureauBil./NO.

This was due to the failure of applicants to submit supportive documents regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of the products in the allocated time frame. From 2008 onwards, applicants had to submit all the required documents within 6 months from the time of product dossier submission. As a result, there was a marked increase in the number of rejected products (especially for traditional products) in 2008 compared to other years.

Most of these products were generic products. The main source of non-prescriptions products was from the United States which accounted for 27.4% of the total number of imported products for this category whereas China was the main source of traditional products. (Figures / Traditional Veterinar / Veterinary42006 - 8 --2007 2 64 -902008 15 or Withdrawn Products In 2010, there was an increase of 5% from 2009 (Figure 4) in the number of products cancelled/withdrawn for all product categories except non-prescription products. This was the result of increased monitoring activities on all registered products.

There was an increase of 8 % in 2010 from the previous year for the number of applications received for the renewal of product registration (Figure 10).30 Biro Enforcement Division NPCB has been cooperating closely with the Pharmacy Enforcement Division in verifying the registration status of products. The registration status of products seized by the Pharmacy Enforcement Division under the Control of Drugs and Cosmetics Regulations 1984 would require verification before any legal action is taken. There was an increasing trend in the number of request for product verification. In 2010, there was an increase of 17.6% in the number of requests received compared to the previous year (Figure 11). The most number of requests had been received from the Johor State Pharmacy Enforcement Division (Figure 12). This trend reflected an increase in the pharmacy enforcement activities to ensure that only safe, quality and efficacious products are in the market. Bilangan Produk Number of Products 2006 2007 2008 Enforcement Purposes, 2006-201031 CHALLENG ES The main challenge faced by this centre is to ensure that all products are registered within the timeline specified in the client' s charter. Thus, the sections concerned have to find ways to better manage and expedite the evaluation process without compromising the quality, safety and effectiveness of the product. Among the measures taken include: a) Discussions and interactions with applicants. These one- to-one sessions are intended to guide the applicant in terms of the requirements for registration and problem solving on grey areas in order to speed up the registration process. b) Contacting applicants by phone calls, e-mails and letters and providing step by step technical guidance on using the QUEST 3 system. c) Conducting workshops and training sessions for of Product Registration Status Verified by the Pharmacy Enforcement Division (by state), 201032 Biro Group (TWG) sessions with representatives from the industries and associations in order to strengthen the registration process to ensure safety, efficacy and quality of registered products. e) Updating the Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) through various workshops and meetings to produce a more comprehensive guidelines to help applicants better understand the requirements for product registration. 6.0 THE WAY FORWARD This centre is continuously looking into ways to further enhance and strengthen the registration of pharmaceutical products in Malaysia. Some of the measures taken to ensure the effectiveness of generic products are as follows: i) Products with active ingredients from the highly variable categories will require more detailed and critical evaluations. ii) In addition to the current active ingredients requiring BE studies, generic products with active ingredients intended to treat psychiatric patients will also require BE studies. iii) Continuous in-house training and attachment courses are also conducted so as to increase the number of evaluators who are experts in specific areas such as bioequivalence and validation processes. The Centre for Product Registration is also in the process of regulating active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Controlling the APIs used in products is important to ensure that the final products registered are of quality, efficacious and safe. The regulatory control of API will be implemented in phases beginning with voluntary submission of technical dossier data for New Chemical Entities (NCE) in March 2011 followed by mandatory implementation on other products according to phases as follows:33 Biro Pengawalan st January 2012) Phase IIGeneric products containing Scheduled Poison as active ingredient (Date to be determined later) Phase III Generic products containing non-scheduled Poison as active ingredient (Date to be determined later) The regulatory control of veterinary products will be further strengthened through the compulsory licensing of the manufacturers of veterinary products as well as licensing of local manufacturers which is expected to be effective on 1st January 2012. Guidelines on the requirements for higher treatment claims/ indications for traditional products and health supplements are in the pipeline. This guideline will take into consideration the regulatory requirements of other ASEAN countries, Europe, Canada and Australia so that Malaysia can emerge as a competitive partner for these products. Several meetings have been held with the various stakeholders and this guideline is expected to be endorsed by the DCA in 2011.Biro Centre for Quality Control (CQC) is an integral part of the National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB). It is responsible in ensuring that the approved therapeutic products in the Malaysian market are safe, effective and of quality. It also ensures that the approved natural medicines and the notified cosmetics are safe and of high quality through testing and evaluation of analytical documentation, which are carried out in accordance with the global regulatory specifications / standard and performed by trained and competent CQC personnel. 2.0 OBJECTIVES CQC will continuously strive to achieve the goal by improving and strengthening the quality control system through the following objectives: To carry out chemical and biological tests in compliance with the procedure and methodology of international standards To research and develop testing methodologies To produce chemical and biological reference standards for the use of local institutions and the pharmaceutical industries To optimize the expertise in assisting the local industry and related institutions in the areas of quality control To involve continuously in collaborative studies and proficiency testing scheme organised by the ASEAN, WHO, EDQM and other regulatory agencies to strengthen the ability and competence in the analytical field To collaborate with the Centre for Compliance and Licensing in auditing the manufacturers of pharmaceutical, natural medicines and cosmetics to ensure that their quality control laboratories comply with the prescribed regulations and guidelines.PUSAT KAWALAN KUALITI CENTRE FOR - \"Chinese Medicine Proficiency Testing\" anjuran IFM Services (Australia) - Content in ACHIEVEMENTS Since 1996, CQC has given high commitment to maintain the recognition from the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a Collaborating Centre for Regulatory Control of Pharmaceuticals. Following this recognition, CQC had acquired a number of impressive achievements in 2010 including: Coordinated the establishment of two ASEAN reference standards (ARS); Atenolol ARS and Chlorpheniramine Maleate ARS. Taking part in various collaborative studies and proficiency testing. In 2010, these proficiency testing scheme include: - External Quality Assurance Assessment Scheme Phase 5 organised by WHO - Chinese Medicine Proficiency Testing organised by IFM Quality Services (Australia) - Cadmium Content in Water and Plumbum Content in Food by Chemistry Department Malaysia - Dissolution testing of Paracetamol 500mg Tablet organised by Thailand. Providing training on analytical testing techniques to new officers or WHO fellows through local training scheme or international cooperation scheme. Conducted audits on 28 quality control laboratories of local manufacturers for compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). In January 2010, CQC has successfully acquired an accreditation of MS ISO/ IEC 17025:2005 by Department of Standards Malaysia for following scopes: - Testing of Arsenic, Lead and Cadmium in traditional products - Microbial Contamination Test in traditional products - Disintegration test for traditional products - Uniformity of weight for traditional products 38 Biro Pengawalan Farmaseutikal Kebangsaan National Control BureauPenilaian Protokol dan Evaluation of Protocol Analysis and Data Bilangan Number 2006 2007 2008 Tahun validasi (2006 - 2010) Figure 13: Evaluation of protocol analysis and validation data (2006 - 2010) Figure 13 shows the number of protocol of analysis and analytical validation data evaluated from 2006 - 2010. In 2008, there was a significant change in the total number of assessment due to the transformation of pharmaceutical product registration process in which pre-registration test sample was replaced with a full assessment of validation data. The decline in the amount of validation data evaluated in 2010 might be associated with the upgrading of the NPCB online system (from Quest 2 to Quest 3) that would need time for adaptation.Rajah 13 menggambarkan 2010 Figure NON-PRESCRIPTIONTRADITIONALCOSMETICVETERINARYPRESCRIPTIONNON-PRESCRIPTIONTRADITIONAL Samples Received Sample testing is one of the core activities of the Centre for Quality Control (CQC). Figure 14 shows the different categories of samples received for testing in year 2010. Samples for testing were from pre-registered and post-registered samples, complaint cases. The tests are conducted based on international pharmacopoeias specifications, internal procedures as well as approved protocol specifications. 40 Biro Pengawalan Farmaseutikal Kebangsaan National illustrates a reduction in the number of samples received for each category from 2006 to 2010. This was due to: (i) The transformation of the pharmaceutical product registration process in 2008. The testing of pharmaceutical samples for pre-registration was substituted with the assessment of validation data. Since then, testing was focused on the post-registration samples and pre-registration traditional samples. However , pre-registration tests were still being carried out for applications submitted before 2008. (ii) The establishment of forensic laboratories in the Pharmaceutical Services Division has resulted in a diminution of the sample received from Enforcement (CPF) for adulterants screening. However , NPCB still receives samples from other Enforcement branches for the purpose of prosecution or court cases. Bilangan Number Complaint 2007 The total amount of samples tested in 2010 showed an increment of 3% compared to 2009 (Figure 16). The post-registration (surveillance) and enforcement samples were the major contributors to the increment. However , a similar pattern was observed in Figure 15, whereby the amount of samples being tested for registration purpose decreased every year due to the transformation process of the pharmaceutical product registration.

It is used as the comparison material for confirmation and quantification during testing. The Reference Standard Unit was established in 1994. This unit is responsible for activities pertaining to procurement, production, storage, supply and management of chemical and biological reference farmaseutikal.In 2010, the supply of reference standards had declined in comparison to the previous year (Figure 19). This was mainly due to the abolishment of the pre-registration sample testing for pharmaceutical products and a decreased demand of reference standards from other government agencies as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers. 2006 2007 2008 Tahun YearGovernment Agency Industry / Standards (2006 - 2010) Rajah of reference standards produced. NPCB Working/Secondary Standards were produced by standardization of the certified reference materials against primary standards. Apart from this, the NPCB also collaborates with other ASEAN countries to produce ASEAN Reference Standards. 5.0 CHALLENGES Research and development of testing methodologies is a major challenge for CQC. This field requires knowledge, skills and extensive technical expertise in the field of chemical and biological pharmaceutics. This is to ensure that the testing methods developed are innovative and of quality. In addition, it is a huge responsibility to manage this field proactively, particularly when dealing with 'rapid alert' issue relating to the safety of products in the Malaysian market. CQC encounters significant challenges in the detection of adulterants containing analogue such as sildenafil analogue and sibutramine analogue. These challenges require CQC personnel to be equipped with the knowledge, skills and expertise in isolation, extraction and purification. Apart from that, they also need to understand the structural elucidation as well as having the capabilities of interpreting analytical data. The same skills and expertise are needed in verifying the plants species in natural medicinal products through bio- marker detection. This is in line with the Drug Control Authority (DCA) policy paper regarding the implementation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Control and chemical approaches (chemotaxonomy). 6.0 THE WAY FORWARD Accreditation scope extension in MS ISO/IEC 17025:2005 with the additional tests as below: - Testing method of Arsenic, Lead, Cadmium and Mercury in cosmetic and health supplement products - Testing method of lovastatin in traditional products - Testing method for screening of sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil in traditional products - Testing method for screening and determination of hydroquinone in cream cosmetic products.47 to train and authorize more competent/qualified quality control laboratory auditors (in chemical & microbiology) for the purpose of enhancing GMP compliance within local pharmaceutical industries.

The rise in ADR reports per year was a result of efforts to promote awareness on ADR reporting through workshops and talks held from time to time. The drastic increase in AEFI reports in 2010 was due to the launching of the national Human Papillomavirus (HPV) immunisation program as well as the usage of H1N1 vaccines in the face of the received by reporters 2007-2010. 8,000 7,0006,0005,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 2007 2008 2009 2010Number of ADR Report Number of 2009.Government healthcare professionals contribute to the largest portion of ADR reports received each year. The majority of these reports were provided by government pharmacists with a total of 4160 reports, a 19.2% increase from the previous year. The number of ADR reports from private healthcare professionals had increased as much as 72% from 2009 (from 144 reports to 248). The ADR reports received in 2010 involved 7755 suspected products of which 7134 (92.0%) were prescription products, 443 (5.7%) non-prescription products and the remaining 176 products (2.3%) were traditional medicine, cosmetics, food and unregistered products. Apart from vaccines, cardiovascular products contributed to the highest number of reports with a total of 1451 (26.1%) products, by 1172 (21.0%) anti-infective products, and 548 (9.8%) analgesics.

These information changes include updating the package inserts, changes to the product formula and change of manufacturing site. Rajah 29: Permohonan Variasi Yang Diterima Pada Submissions Processed According To Product Category (2010) A total of 49,653 variation applications were received in 2010. Almost 60% of the variation applications were for prescription products (Figure 31). 92.3% (45,840) of the variation applications were processed in 2010. A total of 30,281applications were approved while 15,559 were rejected. The most common factors contributing to the rejection of applications were: a) The changes applied did not comply with the regulations, b) The documents submitted were incomplete, c) The documents attached were irrelevant to the information required. The number of applications received from 2008 to 2010 is consistent. More than 90% of these applications were processed within the time line. On average, the number of variation applications received during 2008 to 2010 is 26.4% (10,411) more than in 2007. The drastic increase seen after 2007 was due to several factors, such as new circulars issued by the DCA. 2010 Figure 31: Variation Submissions Received and Processed from 2006 to 2010 to time with directives whereby the product registration holders are required to update the product information via the Variation Section. Among the circulars that contributed to the increase of variation applications are: a) Standardisation of labels for health supplements. b) Warnings of label and package inserts of oral liquids that contain anti-histamines, anti-tussives and decongestants (as a single active ingredient or combination) for the treatment of cough and colds. c) Addition of the name and address of the product registration holder onto the labels of traditional products and health supplements. d) Declaration of animal source on product labels. e) Implementation of patient pack size for pharmaceutical products. f) Removal of the statement \"Approved by MOH\" from the labels of locally marketed medicinal products. g) New specifications for microbial contamination test. Other factors contributing to the increase in variation applications included directives from the Pharmacovigilance Section to update the safety information as well as directives from the Surveillance and Complaints Section to update the changes that had been made to the product without prior approval from the 2010 Figure 32: Change of Manufacturing Site Applications Received from 2006 to 2010 Bilangan 2006 2007 2008 Tahun Year2009 PBKD.A total of 450 applications for change of manufacturing sites were received in 2010. This is almost similar to the number of applications (481) received in 2009. On average, the number of applications received during these two years is 106% (240) more than in 2008. Among the factors contributing to this drastic increase in the number of change of manufacturing site applications include: a) transfer of premises to a different location, b) upgrading of the current premises, c) mergers between companies, d) appointment of a new traditional medicine manufacturer due to the suspension of previous manufacturing license by the DCA.63 Biro Pengawalan ke semasa.4.0 COSMETIC NOTIFICATION 4.1 OBJECTIVE To ensure that cosmetic products comply with current regulatory requirements and are of high quality and safe to use. 4.2 ACTIVITIES Post Market Surveillance activities conducted include: screening of the product information and formulation to ensure that it is free from any banned ingredients and that all ingredients are used within the allowed limits auditing of product information file (PIF) sampling and testing of products to ensure that the products meet the quality standards for cosmetics checking of product labels and claims to ensure they comply with the labeling requirements monitoring of adverse events from the use of cosmetics auditing cosmetic manufacturers to ensure that the products are manufactured in manufacturing facilities that are suitable and that comply with Good Manufacturing Requirements (GMP) handling of product complaints from the public monitoring of cosmetic product advertisements 4.3 ACHIEVEMENTS Quest 3 Cosmetic Module The Cosmetic Module of the Quest 3 system was officially launched in July 2010 to replace the existing Quest 2 system. Several upgrades had been made with the new system including an auto-screening function which screens the product formula for prohibited ingredients and restricted ingredients exceeding the allowable limit, product names that are not allowed, control of new substances and many other improvements to help the cosmetic notification system run smoothly. The Quest 3 system is also equipped with a new and regularly updated database of cosmetic ingredients.64 Biro had been designed to be more user-friendly and allows the industry better data management for their notified products. Consumer Awareness Programme The Cosmetics Section had been involved in several programs to promote awareness on control of cosmetics and its safety. The Cosmetics Section had given talks to beauty salon operators, member of PUSPANITA and community pharmacists. The number of notified cosmetic products had increased by 142% from 37,466 in 2009 to 2010 Figure Products in 2010 11 1%12 1% 40 4%111 10% 898 84%Penyaringan of the cosmetic product notification cancellations were a result of formulation screening. These products were found to contain banned ingredients or ingredients exceeding the allowable limit or requirements. Since the implementation of the Quest 3 auto-screening function, these issues were detected more effectively. The number of Product Information Files (PIF) audited had increased over the years since its implementation in 2008. There was more active selection of products to be audited and the product notification holders were more aware of the PIF requirements and the importance of self-regulation. Rajah 35: Audit Maklumat Produk Information File (PIF) 0 2008 2009 2010Fail the number of permits issued for the import of cosmetic products without notification for market sampling or in-house evaluation. Figure 37 shows the number of Certificates of Free Sales issued to cosmetic notification holders for the export of locally manufactured products. 4.4 IMPROVEMENTS ON CURRENT ISSUES In 2010, the Director of Pharmaceutical Services had issued two directives related to cosmetic products as a result of safety issues that were identified under the Post Market Surveillance Program. These were: i) Directive \"Bilangan 1 Tahun 2010\" regarding cosmetic products used around the eye area and packaging not Rajah 36: Market Sampling dan In-house Evaluation Figure products. - This directive was issued following reports and complaints received regarding the sale of products such as eye toners that were originally notified as cosmetic products to moisturise the eye area but were misused as eye drops or sprayed into the eyes for treatment and medicinal purposes. - These products are not classified as cosmetic products and their product notifications were cancelled. - Cosmetic products to be used around the eye area are not allowed to be packaged in eye drop bottles or sprays to avoid the use of these products as eye drops or sprays. ii) Directive \"Bilangan 2 Tahun 2010\" regarding cosmetic products used on the male or female genital area for the purpose of sexual stimulation of men or women is not classified as cosmetic products. - This directive was issued following reports and complaints received regarding the sale of products that were originally notified to be used as skin moisturiser for the genital area of men or women but were misused for the purpose of sexual treatment. - Products to be applied on the male or female genital area as leave-on preparations are not classified as cosmetic products and their product notifications were cancelled. These products may be misused due to claims and advertisements that are out of the cosmetic product scope and the safety of the product when used around the male or female genital area is unknown.68 Biro PRODUCT SURVEILLANCE AND COMPLAINTS Almost 50% of the products targeted for sampling for 2010 failed to be sampled due to reason such as the product had not been marketed. This had indirectly affected the effectiveness of Post Marketing Surveilance Program because this did not reflect the actual number of registered products/notified cosmetics in the market. Due to the lack of infrastructure and manpower , at present only high risk cosmetic products are targeted for laboratory testing, of which this is a relatively small fraction of all notified cosmetic products in the market. 5.2 PHARMACOVIGILANCE i. Low Incidence of ADR Reporting Among Healthcare Practitioners Adverse event reports by healthcare practitioners, especially from the private sector , are lacking despite the general increase in the number of ADR reports. ii. Incomplete ADR reports ADR reports received lack vital information and have hampered the process of causality assessment. The reporter has to be contacted to provide further information. iii. No ADR Signal Detection System Inavailability of an efficient ADR signal detection system to facilitate proactive action on medicines with safety issues and to enable the implementation of prompt preventative action. Currently, signal detection is monitored manually. iv. Increased Workload The number of ADR reports received has consistently increased over the years. Investigations need to be carried out, especially on serious adverse effects, for accurate causality assessment. With the increase in number of reports and the need to contact the reporters to acquire additional information, the capacity of NPCB staff has to be increased in order to handle the workload. 69 Biro Pengawalan Farmaseutikal Kebangsaan National Pharmaceutical Control (AVG) Malaysia telah diberikan penghormatan oleh ASEAN Consultative Committee on Standards and Quality - Pharmaceutical Product Working Group (ACCSQ - PPWG) untuk menerajui dalam VARIATION i. ASEAN Variation Guideline (AVG) Malaysia was given the honor by the ASEAN Consultative Committee on Standards and Quality - Pharmaceutical Product Working Group (ACCSQ - PPWG) to lead the drafting of the ASEAN Variation Guideline (AVG). An ASEAN Variation Guideline Workshop was organised at the NPCB on the 8 th - 10th of February 2010. Following the consensus of the discussion during the workshop, the 4thdraft of the AVG was presented during the ACCSQ-PPWG in Jakarta. The 5th draft has been circulated to ASEAN Member Statesat the end of 2010. The challenge is to compile the comments received before a consensus can be made. ii. Quest 3 Variation and Change of Manufacturing Site Modules The Variation Section continuouslyprovide technical input in the development of the Quest 3 Variation and Change of Manufacturing Site modules to further improve services provided to applicants. The Quest 3 module, in comparison to Quest 2, has been designed based on the type of variation application which will allow the module to generate more accurate statistical reports. An interactive feature available in the system will facilitate correspondence between the applicant and the evaluator. The use of the online Quest 3 system for Change of Manufacturing Site submission is expected to reduce the workload of the applicants and assist the Variation Section in the evaluation process. iii. Processing Fees The Variation Section is in the process of preparing the proposal to impose a fee for variation and Type I change of manufacturing site applications, in view of the statistics of variation and change of manufacturing site applications over the years. 70 Biro Pengawalan Farmaseutikal Kebangsaan National National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau5.4 CONTROL OF COSMETICS i. Cosmetic Notification System With the implementation of the cosmetic notification system, products may enter the market more easily. Products of low quality and that do not comply with the notification requirements can only be detected during Post Market Surveillance. Hence, the consumers may potentially come across products of low quality or products that present claims outside of the cosmetic scope. ii. Notification Holders Lack Technical Knowledge Concerning Product Safety A number of notification holders lack the technical expertise to conduct safety evaluations on their cosmetic products and knowledge regarding the safety of ingredients in the product formulation. iii. Cosmetic Products Advertisements Exceeding the Scope of Cosmetic Products Companies are unaware/lack responsibility when advertising cosmetic products including making unsubstantiated claims exceeding the scope of cosmetics products. This poses as a challenge for NPCB to educate the public so that they do not fall victim to these types of advertisements. 6.0 THE WAY FORWARD 6.1 PRODUCT SURVEILLANCE AND COMPLAINTS Separate units for handling complaints and conducting surveillance were established to further strengthen activities under the Surveillance and Complaints Section. This was possible through the addition of three new officers. Surveillance activities will be enhanced so that product related issues can be detected in a more effective manner. Product holders may then take preventive measures to improve the quality of their products, hence reducing the number of product complaints in the long run. Strengthen product selection in Post Marketing Surveillance with emphasis on traditional products and cosmetics,for efficientdetection of adulteration. Strengthen alliance with the Pharmacy Enforcement Division to improve PMS activitiesespecially in handling adulteration of ADR Reporting NPCB will continue to train pharmacists in hospitals/health clinics/institutions in the effort to improve the quality of ADR reporting and causality assessment. Minimise Patient's Risk of Adverse Events To strengthen activities related to risk minimisation, such as conducting studies/research related to ADR. A national ADR clinical Monitoring Committee will be established to facilitate this. Improve Risk Communication Enhance the effectiveness of risk communication activities to ensure that the safety information of a particular medicine reaches its target. 6.3 VARIATION ASEAN Variation Guideline (AVG) The ASEAN Member States have given their feedback regarding the 5th draft of the AVG. This draft along with the suggestions from the ASEAN Members will be presented to the ACCSQ-PPWG Meeting to be held in Singapore in 2011. The 6 th draft is expected to be distributed after the Meeting. Quest 3 Variation and Change of Manufacturing Site Module The Variation Section will work to ensure that the variation and Change of Manufacturing Site modules will be designed as planned. Efforts will be put in to minimise technical errors to ensure a smooth process flow from the applicant' s submission until evaluation by the evaluator.72 OF COSMETICS Sampling of Cosmetic Products The Cosmetics Section routinely sample whitening products, baby products, products used around the eye area and slimming products.To increase the effectiveness of the Post Market Surveillance system, the criteria and scope of product sampling will be broadened to include hair dyes and products with ambiguous, suspicious or misleading names and functions, such as, breast products, massage products, essential oils and other products with the potential to be promoted exceeding the scope of cosmetics. Cosmetic Safety Expert Committee, CoSEC A Cosmetic Safety Expert Committee (CoSEC) will be formed in 2011 with the aim to strengthen technical knowledge, share the latest information regarding cosmetic ingredients, including ingredients derived from local herbs, and to make decisions concerning safety issues related to cosmetic products. The committee will comprise of representatives from the academia, cosmetic associations, government agencies, research agencies and the regulators.Biro Pengawalan Farmaseutikal Kebangsaan National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau COMPLIANCE MANUFACTURING PRACTICE (GMP) SECTION AND QUALITY, CERTIFICATION, LICENSING & GOOD STORAGE PRACTICE SECTION 1.1 INTRODUCTION Centre for Compliance and Licensing (CCL) is responsible for the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) inspections of manufacturers of registered products and notified cosmetics to ensure manufacturers' compliance towards the current GMP requirements. CCL, with the assistance of the State Pharmacy Enforcement Division, is also responsible for ensuring the importers and wholesalers of registered products adhere to the current Good Storage Practice (GSP) requirements. In addition, CCL is involved in the licensing of manufacturers, importers and wholesalers of registered products. 1.2 OBJECTIVES CCL, through the GMP and GSP inspections, strives to ensure that all registered products and notified cosmetics which are approved for the local market are safe and of quality. 1.3 OTHER ACTIVITIES Other activities that are carried out by CCL are: Evaluation of layout plan of manufacturing premises of registered products and notified cosmetics. Providing advice and guidance relating to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Good Storage Practice (GSP) requirements to the industry. Providing GMP and GSP training for the industries and 'WHO Fellows'. Issuance of GMP certificates and endorsement of document copies concerning licensing. Issuance of additional lists of registered products. Co-operating with other government departments and agencies including the State Pharmacy Enforcement Division in sharing information relating to manufacturers, importers and wholesalers of registered products.PUSAT KOMPLIANS DAN di bawah:1.4 ACHIEVEMENTS Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Inspections In 2010, 324 GMP inspections were carried out. From this figure, 244 of the inspections were routine inspections. These inspections included 100 traditional medicines manufacturers, 85 cosmetic products manufacturers, 39 pharmaceutical products manufacturers, 13 OTC External products manufacturers as well as 7 inspections for veterinary product manufacturers. The remaining 90 inspections were non-routine inspections. These consisted of 15 Prelicensing inspections, 33 Initial Inspections for cosmetic manufacturers, 4 Verification Inspections, 5 Initial Visit for Veterinary product manufacturers and 6 Precertification Inspections. The rest of the non-routine inspections comprised of Prequalification Inspection, Overseas Inspection, Investigation Inspection, Process Validation Preparation Inspection, as well as verification inspections due to poor GMP compliance. The number of inspections carried out since 2005 are shown in the table Number of Inspection 2006 2007 2008 Inspections Throughout 2010, NPCB continued its effort to carry out more GSP inspections on wholesalers and importers licensed by the DCA. There were 89 premises inspected for GSP within Klang Valley in 2010 compared to 60 inspections in 2009, a 48% increment from the previous year. The aim to improve the storage and handling of registered products was further enhanced by the introduction of the Good Distribution Practice (GDP). A few dialogs and meetings with associations from local pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries were carried out to discuss on the draft of GDP Guideline. NPCB also received feedback from various industry representatives such as MOPI, CTFA, DSAM to further improve the drafted guideline which was expected to be published in early of year of 2011. Efforts of introducing the new guideline included 'GDP seminar' which was held at Technology Park Malaysia on 11-12 April 2010. It involved 380 participants among wholesalers, importers and manufacturers for pharmaceutical, traditional and cosmetic industries as well as State Enforcement Officers and Hospital Pharmacists. Overseas GMP Inspections Apart from conducting inspections on local manufacturers, NPCB also performed overseas inspection actively to ensure that the imported products will be manufactured according to current GMP requirements. In 2010, NPCB had received 16 applications for overseas inspection. However , only 1 inspection was conducted in 2010.77 GMP Inspections for Veterinary Products Manufacturers A total of 9 inspections for veterinary products manufacturers were conducted in 2010. 5 of them were precertification inspections and the remaining were Initial Visits. Evaluation of Manufacturer's Suggested Layout Plan 23 layouts from manufacturers had been evaluated and approved by NPCB in 2010 to ensure that the renovation and development of new manufacturing facilities will always comply to current GMP requirements. These layouts were made up of 1 OTC facility, 10 traditional facilities, 11 cosmetic manufacturing facilities and 1 veterinary premise. License Processing Issuance of Manufacturer' s License, Import License and Wholesaler's License is in accordance to Regulation 12 of Control of Drugs and Cosmetics Regulations 1984 (Revision) 2006. In 2010, a total of 1618 licenses were issued and these consisted of 264 manufacturer' s licenses, 319 import licenses and 1035 wholesaler' s licenses (Figure 39). This is a 3.18% increase in comparison to the total number of licenses issued in Number 2006 2007 2008 for Registered Products A total of 480 applications (consisting 1935 registered products) for additional list were processed in the year 2010 (Figure 40). These additional lists were issued based on applications submitted when there are newly registered products. The implementation of cosmetic notification system in 2008 caused a drastic decline in the number of applications from 2007 to 2008. Revocation of Manufacturer's License Under the provisions of sub-regulation 17(1) Control of Drugs and Cosmetics Regulation 1984 (Revision) 2006, the Senior Director of Pharmaceutical Services is authorized to revoke Manufacturer' s License. In 2010, a total of 6 manufacturer' s licenses which consisted of 3 pharmaceutical manufacturers and 3 traditional manufacturers were revoked. 4 of the licenses were revoked due to non-compliance with the current GMP guideline while the remaining were revoked due to adulteration issues.

The inspection was based on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) on clinical site and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) principles on bioanalytical site. This is the first inspection conducted by NPCB following the approval of the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice Inspection by the DCA on 29 th July 2010. The NPCB's Preparations as the National Compliance Monitoring Authority (CMA) for Non-clinical GLP Studies. The NPCB had successfully collaborated with The Malaysian Biotechnology Corporation in organising the Good Laboratory Practice Workshop on Study Director & Quality Assurance (QA) on 2-3 August 2010 at Istana Hotel, Kuala Lumpur. The objectives of this workshop was to give a thorough understanding about the roles and responsibility of Study Director and QA in GLP studies. In preparation for the Mutual Joint Visit (MJV) Inspection by OECD GLP inspection team, the NPCB has taken an initiative to conduct a mock inspection observed by an OECD GLP Expert from Norway. The mock inspection was carried out at the Environmental Technology Research Centre (ETRC), SIRIM Berhad on 4-5 August 2010. Its purpose was to evaluate the competency of the NPCB inspectors while performing inspections. The findings during the mock inspection were discussed and positive feedbacks were received from the expert. In order to strenghten the NPCB GLP Compliance Monitoring Programme, the GLP Manual, procedures and forms involved had been reviewed accordingly and the use of new documents shall be effective from January 2011. The review of documents were done based on NPCB' s standard operating procedures and the comments received from the OECD GLP expert during the mock inspection.86 on MedDRA and Its Application in Safety Drug Monitoring Klinikal \"ASEAN Workshop in Safety Drug Monitoring\" dari 17-19 Mac 2010 di STANDARDS MALAYSIA had conducted series of In-House Training for their GLP Inspectors. The trainings were conducted to harmonize the understanding and interpretation among the Compliance Monitoring Authorities (CMAs) inspectors pertaining to Principles of OECD GLP and to exchange views on any GLP issues. The ASEAN Workshop on MedDRA and Its Application in Safety Drug Monitoring The Clinical Research & Compliance Section (CRCS), NPCB had collaborated with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)-Global Corporation Group (GCG) - ASEAN Collaboration to organise \"The ASEAN Workshop on MedDRA and Its Application in Safety Drug Monitoring\" on 17-19 March 2010 at Le Meridien Hotel, Kuala Lumpur. There were 50 participants from ASEAN regulatory bodies and local industry who participated in this workshop. It was aimed to provide guidance on international standardization of terminology used in pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring in clinical trial. National Committee for Clinical Research (NCCR) In 2010, the CRCS served as the secretariat to the NCCR. The committee is chaired by the Director General of Health Malaysia, Y. Bhg. Tan Sri Dato' Seri Dr. Hj. Mohd. Ismail Merican. Two meetings were held in the year 2010, which are on the 16 th August 2010 and 29th November 2010. In addition, CRCS had also acted as the secretariat to the Malaysian Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice Committee. A meeting was held by the committee on 1 st October 2010 to update the second edition of the Malaysian Guidelines for Good Clinical according to current needs. The third edition of this guidelines is expected to be published in 2011. Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Courses A total of 23 courses were organised by Clinical Research Centre (CRC), Ministry of Health Malaysia and Universities in all over the country for the year 2010 where the Clinical Research and Compliance Section played important roles in giving lecture and invigilating the GCP examination. These courses were organised to provide exposures and training on the GCP aspects to all researchers and staffs who were involved in clinical trials.87 Biro Pengawalan Farmaseutikal Kebangsaan National Pharmaceutical (CRO), 2010.Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) Report As many as 2,885 SUSAR reports were received by NPCB in year 2010. These reports involved clinical trials that had CTIL and were submitted according to the Malaysian Guideline for GCP . Guideline for GCP Inspection The first edition of Guidelines for GCP Inspection had been successfully launched and uploaded in the official NPCB website in October 2010. This guideline was the outcome of the GCP Programme Committee Meeting involving sponsors, Contract Research Organisation (CRO), investigators and Pharmaceutical Association of Malaysia which was held on 8 th July 2010. The Drug Control Authority (DCA) had approved the guideline in its 230 th meeting on 29th July 2010. Shortening of The Approval Timelines for CTIL/CTX The timelines for processing Clinical Trial Import License (CTIL) and Clinical Trial Exemption (CTX) application except for clinical trial involving biological, biotechnology product, advanced therapy product and First-in human clinical trial had been successfully shortened from 2 months to less than 30 working days. This was effective from 1 st July 2010.88 Biro Bureau2.3 CABARAN Contract Research Malaysia (CRM) adalah salah satu Entry Point Project (EPP) daripada 6 EPPs yang dikenalpasti dalam National keperluan GLP.2.3 CHALLENGES The Contract Research Malaysia (CRM) had been identified as one of the 6 Entry Point Projects (EPPs) in the National Key Economy Area (NKEA). Among the targets set by CRM is to have 800 clinical researches conducted in Malaysia by 2020. With the target, evaluators from CRCS will be facing higher demands and growing interest from sponsors, the Contract Research Organisation (CRO) and investigators to conduct clinical research especially in the following fields in Malaysia: a. First-in-human trial or commonly known the phase I clinical trial b. Advance Therapy Product (ATP) Evaluating the clinical trials mentioned above is very challenging. Thus, evaluators should undergo specialised training in evaluating the quality, safety and efficacy of the innovative products. The manpower capacity building could be attained through attachments with other experienced regulatory authorities such as EMEA, USFDA, Australian TGA and etc. With a more competent regulatory platform, Malaysia will undoubtedly attract more investment in conducting clinical trials; which is integral in the realisation of Malaysia as the regional Clinical Trial hub. The challenge faced by the NPCB is to assist Malaysia in achieving the status of full adherence to the Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) System by the end of 2011. In order to become a non-OECD member adhering to MAD system, the NPCB is subjected for a Mutual Joint Visit (MJV) Inspection by the OECD GLP inspection team. The inspection involves review of the NPCB GLP Compliance Monitoring Programme as well as observation on the Test Facility Inspection by NPCB inspectors. The NPCB is facing a challenge to ensure that its Compliance Monitoring Programme fulfilled the OECD GLP requirements and Test Facilities are compliant with OECD Principles of GLP .89 Biro FORWARD In consideration of the development and expansion of activities carried out by CRCS in several areas such as: a. Investigational product evaluation which includes pharmaceutical products, biotechnology products, advanced therapy products, herbal products, health supplements and others. b. Investigational product safety monitoring which involved all clinical trials that have the Clinical Trial Import License. c. GCP and GLP inspection on Bioequivalence Study Centers. d. GCP inspection on clinical sites, sponsors, clinical research organisation (CRO) and ethics committee. e. GLP inspection on non-clinical Test Facilities As a result, CRCS will be promoted into a centre led by a Deputy Director in 2011. NPCB is committed to achieve full adherence to the Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) System of OECD GLP . By being a non-OECD member adhering to the MAD, all non-clinical data produced in Malaysia will be accepted in other member countries. This will eventually boost up Malaysia as one of the non-clinical studies hubs in Southeast Asia. A directive has been issued under Regulation 29, The Regulation for Control of Drug and Cosmetic 1984, Number 1 2011: Accreditation for local bioequivalence (BE) centres in terms of compliance with GCP and GLP will be fully enforced in 2012. Five local BE centers have been identified for BE inspection by this section in 2011. The inspection for foreign BE centers will commence in 2012.Biro INTRODUCTION Noting the importance of both internal and external communications, NPCB continues to work closely and collaborate with local industry, industry associations, health professionals, academia, consumers as well as other stakeholders. This is mainly with the aim to further enhance the overall effectiveness of the regulatory system in Malaysia. 2.0 OBJECTIVES Responsible in providing product/drug information to officers involved in product evaluation and also to those who are involved in patient care to provide the best service to the public. Ensure only updated information is found on the NPCB website. Monitor NPCB'S computer system and to ensure that the online registration system (QUEST 3) functions smoothly. Responsible in providing information on product registration procedures and other relevent matters such as registration status (for pharmaceutical, traditional, and cosmetic products) and other information which is required by the public. Organise education programes for professionals and public through exhibition activity. Coordinate training for the officers. Coordinate documentation and activity related to ISO. 3.0 OTHER ACTIVITIES Management of the Information Technology (IT) System Maintenance of NPCB website Handling of enquiries Publications of magazine related to DCA policies (Berita Ubat-ubatan) and the NPCB Annual Report Co-ordinating dialogues with the relevant industry associations Trainings and Courses Handling local and international visitorsPUSAT 4.0 ACHIEVEMENTS Management of the Information Technology (IT) System The ICT Section had put in relentless efforts to ensure the smooth running of the QUEST 3 System. This included the establishment of a dedicated IT Unit within NPCB which oversees the computer system as well as a Helpdesk within NPCB (to ensure better monitoring of problems encountered by customers), outsourcing of maintenance and troubleshooting. Maintenance of the NPCB Website Several new/updated articles such as guidelines to facilitate regulatory matters were revised and developed. The adopted documents are downloadable from the official NPCB website (www.bpfk.gov.my). Handling of Enqueries Centre for Organisational Development plays an important role in supplying general information to consumers and industries. A total of 3,062 enquiries had been received by the centre in 2010. An increase of 15% (Figure 43) was seen compared to 2009 which could be attributed to the introduction of QUEST 3 system in product registration. Rajah Pharmaceutical of Malaysia (PhAMA), Malaysian Organisation of Pharmaceutical Industries (MOPI), Cosmetic, Toiletry and Association Malaysia Malaysia, (BPF) of queries for other categories (besides walk-ins) could not be presented as the data was not listed separately from the total number of queries Publication In 2010, 4 editions of the Drug Control Authority (DCA) bulletin i.e Berita Ubat-ubatan (containing news and updated policies of the DCA) and 1 edition of NPCB Annual Report were published. Coordinating Dialogues with the Relevant Industry Associations The NPCB works closely and collaborates with the local industry, industry associations, health professionals, academia, consumers and other stakeholders to further enhance the effectiveness of the comprehensive regulatory system currently in place. In line with this, NPCB frequently plans and organises meetings, technical working groups (TWG) and dialogues with the relevant industries when necessary. A total of 8 dialogue sessions were held in the year 2010 including dialogues with Pharmaceutical Association of Malaysia (PhAMA), Malaysian Organisation of Pharmaceutical Industries (MOPI), Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association Malaysia (CFTA), Malaysia Direct Distribution Association (MDDA), Malaysian Homeopathic Medical Council, Malaysia Dietary Supplement Association (MADSA), Penguatkuasa Farmasi (BPF) and Malaysian Development Institute (MDI). Training and Courses The Continuous Professional Development (CPD) Programme for pharmacist and assistant pharmacists is part of the training programme under the purview of this centre. In 2010, NPCB organised a total of 103 CPD sessions which encompassed educational talks, workshops, Journal Club Sessions as well Tahun/ Year Jenis pertanyaan/ Type of Queries2006^^2007^^2008^^2009 2010 Telefon/ Phone - - 267 337 151 134 Faks & surat/ Fax & Letter - - - yang merupakan WHO staffs were also sent for relevant training sessions organised by other parties/ organisations/agencies. Visits by Local and International Visitors As the only WHO Collaborating Centre for Regulatory Control of Pharmaceuticals in Malaysia, the NPCB continues to provide training in pharmaceutical quality assurance and regulatory affairs. In 2010, the NPCB had received 136 local visitors and 23 international visitors from countries such as Singapore, Maldives, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Ireland, Botswana, Tanzania and Nigeria. The courses provided were designed specifically to fulfil the needs of the individual fellows. For example, training in pharmaceutical analysis, product registration, pharmacovigilance, surveillance, good manufacturing practice and licensing system. ^: In 2006, the Complaints for QUEST 2 were monitored under Queries #: The Exhibition Unit was formed in 2007 Tahun/ Year Aktiviti/ Activities2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Pembangunan QUEST 3 QUEST 3 Development- - Penyelesaian Aduan 24 114 23 Pengendalian LatihanTraining (CPD) 51 57 71 92 103 PenerbitanPublication4 4 4 4 4 DialogDialogue5 6 5 6 8 Pameran # Exhibition# - The implementation of QUEST 3 system to replace QUEST 2 system signified an improvement in administration procedure. As a result, few challenges have evolved with the implementation of QUEST3. For instance, the public has to adapt to a new system and has to be trained and educated on how to use the functions in QUEST3. Besides, the new system of QUEST 3 has yet to mature as the function is not fully operational due to the migration of data that takes time to be done. In addition, the system has yet to stabilize technically. The centre is facing another challenge of updating the official NPCB website. It requires continuous efforts to update the website regularly such as the latest status of QUEST 3, news and important announcements. Moreover , the centre has to ensure that the website is fully functional in areas such as links as well as search engines. Last but not least, most of the staff at the centre are relatively junior. Thus, the lack of exposure and working experience would prove to be a challenge to the centre in overcoming its tasks. 6.0 THE WAY FORWARD The centre will strive to stabilize QUEST 3 system in 2011. For instance, efforts will be made with the vendor of QUEST 3 in releasing downloadable patches that will stabilize and avoid interuption of usage of QUEST 3. As a whole, these will increase efficiency of the system. In order to ensure that the staff at the centre are better equipped and gain more exposure, more structured trainings and workshops should be provided to them. Furthermore, the addition of more senior staff is very much welcomed for their experience are vital to the centre.Biro Pengawalan Farmaseutikal Kebangsaan National INTRODUCTION All matters pertaining to financial management are conducted by the Centre for Administration which is also responsible for general administration and other non-professional matters. This centre ensures that all emoluments and claims are paid within the stipulated time and oversees if the financial allocations are sufficient to ensure all planned activities achieve their objectives.

For instance, improvement at the Finance Unit in the purchasing of goods and services is done through a new purchasing sub- module known as e-Perolehan. This sub-module is recognized to enable all the suppliers and contractors to present their goods and services online. Besides, it helps the NPCB in promoting new development projects with the specifications needed. In addition, the lack of official vehicles at NPCB has prompted the plan to purchase more vehicles in 2011.Biro Pengawalan Farmaseutikal Kebangsaan National Pharmaceutical (PIC/S) Seminar107 Biro Pengawalan Farmaseutikal Kebangsaan National WORKSHOP109 Biro Pengawalan Farmaseutikal Kebangsaan National Pharmaceutical OF MALAYSIAN CIVIL SERVICE (PUSPANITA) Mr. Selvaraja Seerangam continued as the advisor for NPCB PUSPANITA in 2010.
