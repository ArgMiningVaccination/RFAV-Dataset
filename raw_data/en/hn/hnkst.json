Ideally your takeaways from the experience will impact all of the dimensions of wellness in some way. Spiritual health encompasses various facets and can affect different dimensions of your health. The practice of spirituality is to produce a meaningful connection to life and to ground yourself in a new atmosphere. Global experiences, just like spiritual health, takes a look deep within yourself to discover your sense of self both physically and emotionally. In a search for substance and reason many are driven to find a sense of harmony leading to stability throughout various aspects. Spirtual practices can be used as a healthy coping mechanism for the everyday uncertainties in life, espcially while living in a new enviornment. You can practice spiritual health through the practice of yoga, joining an organized religion, or ending your day to jot down the things you are grateful for. The practice of spirituality and focus on spiritual health does not have one specific look or way of practice but rather the focus is to maintain balance and purpose in everyday life resulting in resiliency. | | Resources | | [Ways to Improve Spiritual Wellness ](https://news.illinoisstate.edu/2014/02/7-ways-improve-spiritual-wellness/)- The University of Illinois' helpful tips on how to incorporate spiritual wellness into your everyday life.
