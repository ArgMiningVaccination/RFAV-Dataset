Orrin G. Hatch (chair-man) presiding.OPENING STATMENT OF SENATOR HATCHPresent: Senators Hatch, Kennedy, Hawkins, and Quayle.The CHAIRMAN. We will now go into the hearing on the Health'Professions Education/Nurse Training and National Service Corps,and with appropriate apologies to you folks for having to wait thislong.Today we will be considering a major restructuring of severalexisting health programs to reflect the changing realities of healthcare delivery in America in the 1980's. These bills are S. 799, dealing with health professions education and nurse training, andS. 801, dealing with the National Health Service Corps.Last September, during oversight hearings chaired by then Sena-tor Richard S. Schweiker, this committee began an examination ofthe changing trend in Americans' access to health care services.The nucleus of these changes is the inescapable fact that between19'78 and 1990 there will be a 50-percent increase in the number ofpracticing physicians. America has never experienced such anabundance of health care providers and it will mean many con-structively competitive changes benefiting both patients and medi-cal practitioners.There will also be additional problems for us to solve. Last year,for example, Dr. David Rogers, president of the Robert Wood John-son Foundation pointed out that even with the ongoing massiveimprovements in access to practitioners, many Americans wouldstill be left without convenient access to a personal physician. Andof course we are all concerned about the costs of this access.However, at this same hearing we heard from Drs. Schwartz,Williams, and Newhouse, a group of researchers affiliated withTufts University and the Rand Corp., who presented evidence of aninflux of physicians into more rural areas. I am pleased to reportthat the committee has received an update from these individuals,discussing additional findings highly supportive of their earlier(1)7 2encouraging conclusionsthis report will be inserted in the hear-ing record following my statement.These changes in our country's health care environment greatlyaffect the future of the National Health Service Corps. A programCongress initially developed to improve the delivery of health serv-ices for those Americans least able to receive them, the Corps'recruitment was to be voluntary. It was to last for a fixed andlimited amount of time, until a private physician would becomeavailable.During the last two Congresses, the size of the Corps was expand-ed. More scholarships were made available, and by 1990 this expan-sion in the National Health Service Corps would make the Corps41/2 times its present size.Yet, today can seldom be yesterday. And it would be as unfair asit would be financially imprudent, to keep the current Corps' for-mula as isto do so at a time of a physician surplus and a reducedaggregate Federal financial base. This is a problem S. 801, is in-tended to solve.My proposed National Health Service Corps bill, S. 801, providesfor:(1) A redefinition of health manpower shortage areas andapplicable procedures; (2) use of the Corps only where there isdemonstrable demand; (3) growth from the current 2,060 assigneesto the 2,500 level for at least 3 years; (4) phase-out of the scholar-ship program and transfer to a voluntary program by 1990; (5)revision of the private practice option to provide partial subsidy forindividuals choosing this alternative; and (6) a request that theSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services givefull attention to the surplus of scholarship recipients who will beavailable for service over the next 5 years.The second bill highlighted by today's hearing, S. 799, is alsoaffected by the changing trends. In 1963, the Congress enacted theHealth Professions Act to help alleviate physician, nursing, andtechnician shortages throughout our country. Over the years pro-grams under this act have been broadened to provide financialassistance to both health professions institutions and students.Today, 18 years later, we are faced with increasing numbers ofphysicians, increasing diversity among health professions, and acontinuing bedside nursing shortage for which there is very littlethe Federal Government can do. A thorough look at titles VII andVIII of the Public Health Service Act is not only appropriate, butcrucial, in light of the ever-increasing and competing demands forFederal health dollars.Highlights of S. 799 are. (1) The health professions student loanprogram and the nursing student loan program will be continuedusing the available revolving funds; (2) market-rate loans under theexisting heal program will be salvaged; (3) a new program to pro-vide support services and training opportunities for physicians inunderserved areas will be launched; (4) support to stimulate andmaintain primary health care physician services will be continued,and (5) disadvantaged student programs and support for financiallydistressed schools will be sustained.My bill also addresses nursing problems, although there are nomagic Federal solutions. There are severe problems in nursingincluding, a low wage scale, little or no career mobility, unattrac- 3tive hours and Charles Dickens-like working conditions, problemswhich cannot be solved by traditional Federal approaches. Recog-ni2.:'ng this, S. 799 continues nursing student loans, supports specialprojects; and assists in meeting the need for advanced nurses'training.I feel confident that these bills, S. 799 and S. 801, reflect and areworthy of the years of hard work and ongoing accomplishments inour Nation's medical community. They exemplify the progressachieved in our health care delivery systems and how the peopleworking in these systems are distributed nationally. They acknowl-edge and build upon the moral capital the earlier investment oftime and effort by America's health professionals have made possi-ble. Today's hearing is the keystone in this arch for all of us tobuild upon. This is why I thank you all for coming today, and alongwith the other members of this committee, pledge to work with youduring this leanest of budgetary eras.[The text of S. 7141 154114 *4,45.0(4' 54 16.3.

So ordered.OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR KENNEDYSenator KENNEDY Health professionals are a national resource.They are the vital link in meeting national health care needs. For 20 years the Federal Government has responded to those nationalconcerns by providing support for health trainingto meet healthprofessional shortages and to assure that the disadvantaged haveaccess to health profession careers.In the early 1960's when we were confronted with a shortage of physicians, we provided the incentive and medical schools respond-ed Within 10 years, medical school enrollments had nearly dou-bled.In the early 1970's when we recognized that we had too many subspecialists and not enough primary care physicians, we providedthe incentive and medical schools responded. Today more than halfof all first year resident are in primary care training programs.The Federal Government has made an important contribution tothe excellence of our health professions training programs. It hasprovided support and encouragement for innovative teaching pro-grams like area health education centers, other remote site train-ing, nutrition training, and preventive medicine. It has allowedschools to reach out and train students from disadvantaged back-groundsIt has provided support to maintain and enhance theexcellence of our educational institutions. It has afforded individ-uals from diverse backgrounds, individuals of all income levels,financial access to a health professions education.For nearly 8 years, one administration after another has comebefore this committee and proposed drastic reductions in supportfor health professions education. The justification is always simplis-tic and always the samewe have enough health professionals andwe no longer need to encourage schools to increase their enroll-ments.Do we have enough nurses? Study after study has documentedthe shortage of professional nurses. This administration's response is to cut funding for nurse training by nearly $90 million.Do we have enough public health personnel? Studies, includingreports from the Department of Health and Human Services, docu-ment the shortage of trained public health professionals.Do we have enough veterinarians? Enough podiatrists? Again,the answer is \"No \" Do we have enough physicians and dentists?Maybe But Federal support for health professions training means more than numbers It means financial access to and expensiveeducation for the low- and middle-income student. It means ad-vances in patient care and knowledge. It means the differencebetween excellent and marginal educational programs.Are we prepared to limit access to medical school to those whocan pay their own way? Or force students into lucrative nonpri-20 15mart' care careers or practice locations so they can pay off hugedebts?Are we prepared to stifle innovative education programs andjeopardize quality as schools precipitously slash their budgets? Orthreaten the very existence of minority training institutions?Are we prepared to deny the poor of rural America and inner-city neighborhoods access to primary health care on the basis ofscanty data indicating some physicians are moving past the sub-urbs?I am not prepared to abandon the commitment to quality educa-tion. I am not prepared to deny the availability of that education toqualified students at a reasonable cost.I am not prepared to turn back the clock to the late 1960's when60 of the 102 medical schools were in financial distress, whenprestigious schools like Johns Hopkins faced closure due to lack offunds.Health professions education is the foundation of the future qual-ity of our health care system. We have a responsibility to maintainand strengthen that foundation.The CHAIRMAN. Senator Hawkins?Senator HAWKINS. The committee today considers an issue vitalto our health care system; providing an adequate supply of healthcare professionals. I believe the Federal Government does have aresponsibility to insure that we have a sufficient supply of trainedhealth professionals to meet the health care needs of our Nation.Previous health manpower legislation enacted by Congress suc-cessfully dealt with the physician shortage to the extent that itnow appears that there will be a surplus of physicians by the mid-1990's.Despite this projected surplus, there are still areas of medicalpractice that need to be emphasized. One such area that I hopethat the committee will focus on is family medicine, and the needto encourage physicians to pursue careers in this critical area.The other critical area is nursing. Unfortunately, the nursingshortage remains severe. This shortage is a national problem, butFlorida, because of our age distribution, is increasingly dependentupon nurses to meet the health care needs of our older residents.The nursing shortage in Florida has become so severe that it hasforced local hospitals to close patient units, overwork their existingstaff, or pay salaries that increase the cost of health care.Because of the budget constraints under which we are operating,we will not be able to authorize funding for all worthy programsdesigned to encourage health careers. We will be forced to concen-trate on the most critical areas and the programs that have provento be most effective.The testimony presented before the committee will assist in as-suring that an adequate supply of qualified health care profession-als is available to meet the health care needs of our Nation.The CHAIRMAN. Senator Quayle?Senator QUAYLE. In view of the time I ask unanimous consentthat my statement be inserted into the record.The CHAIRMAN. St, ordered.21 16OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR QUAYLESenator QUAYLE. The subject of today's hearing, health profes-sions education and the National Health Service Corps, are pro-grams which were enacted in an effort, first to overcome a per-ceived shortage in health professionals in the United States andsecond, to put some of that increase in health professionals wherethey were most neededin medically underserved areas.The essential question which must be addressed is the role of theFederal Government in health professions education. Current legis-lation seeks to shift the focus away from institutional supportwhich sought to increase the numbers of health professionals, to anemphasis on priorities in an effort to overcome some of the relatedproblems of geographic and specialty distribution.A perceived surplus in physicians would be welcomed in theState of Indiana where, according to 1978 statistics, there wereonly 130 non-Federal physicians per 100,000 population comparedto a national average of 187 per 100,000. It is hoped that efforts toredistribute health professionals will be successful and that Stateslike Indiana, which currently has 30 areas designated by DHHS asbeing medically underserved, representing a population of some317,000 not receiving or lacking access to primary care services,will benefit.I hope that some of these issues and priorities will be exploredtoday and that we can perhaps come to some solution concerningthe appropriate role of the Federal Government in this matter.The CHAIRMAN. Before we begin with our first panel, we wouldlike to welcome you to the witness table. We are very sorry thatsometimes the committee has to conduct some very important busi-ness. Just be glad we are not investigating you right now.Mr. MILLER. You are.The CHAIRMAN. My goodness, I have to get them to inform me,including Senator Kennedy.We do apologize for the delay, but that was very important, and Ithink it was resolved in a very satisfactory way. We are happy tohave you here.We welcome Mr Charles Miller, the Acting Assistant Secretaryfor Health of the Department of Health and Human Services. He isaccompanied by Susanne Stoiber, Deputy Assistant Secretary forHealth Planning and Evaluation; Robert Graham, M.D., ActingAdministrator, Health Resources Administration, and Daniel White-side, Director, Bureaus of Health Personnel Development andService, Health Services Administration.I might mention for you in advance, it might be difficult formembers of the committee to sit throughout the full hearing, be-cause a number of us are on the Budget Committee. We are inmajor confrontations there, and a number of us have other press-ing difficulties that have to be taken care of. So if you will under-stand that we may have staff take testimony which is crucial to thebills we are trying to get resolved before May 15, so we appreciatethe efforts that you have put forth in being with us today. 22 17STATEMENT OF CHARLES MILLER, ACTING ASSISTANT SECRE-TARY FOR HEALTH, DE,PARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMANSERVICES, ACCOMPANIED BY SUSANNE STOIBER, DEPUTYASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH PLANNING AND EVALU-ATION; ROBERT GRAHAM, M.D., ACTING ADMINISTRATOR,HEALTH RESOURCES ADMINISTRATION; DANIEL WHITESIDE,DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF HEALTH PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENTAND SERVICE, HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, APANELMr. MILLER. Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time, unless youwish otherwiseThe CHAIRMAN. It would be wonderful if you could summarize,because we will put all the statements into the record.Mr. MILLER. I am even offering to skip the summary. I will movedirectly to questions. I do want my statement in the record. I thinkthat the administration's position on matters before you have beenwell stated by the Secretary before you last week, and I will beglad to move to questions.The CHAIRMAN. That is terrific. I think that is a good procedureto follow, and that allows us to ask questions up front.My bill, S. 799, is the same as the administration's proposal withregard to total dollar allocation. Although I propose to use some ofthe funds to support different programs. Nonetheless, I would ask,what is the administration's rationale for such a severe cut inhealth manpower and nurse training programs?Mr. MILLER. Mr. Chairman, I think that given the situationwhere there seems to be a consensus that there are going to haveto be sign;.ficant cuts in Government expenditures, we are going tohave to choose those areas where the Government is put in place,have largely done their work, and I think this is true with respectto the health professions area, more than any other.These programs, many of them, were started and enhanced inorder to increase the supply and affect the distribution of healthpersonnel. While there are still problems remaining before thecountry, and we think that the bills that the administration willsend up will continue to attack those problems, we do believe thatin a tight economy that this is an area that really has to take itsshare.The CHAIRMAN. In light of the projected surplus of physicians,and the administration position, how do you plan to deal with the6,500 scholarship recipients currently in the pipeline?Mr. MILLER. Well, Mr. Chairman, we believe that the level of theNational Health Service Corps that we are proposing for fiscal year1983 will be sufficient to take care of those scholarship recipientsin the pipeline.Our plan is to take a look at the situation in the out years withsome expectation that we will begin the scholarships again.The CHAIRMAN. Will any scholarship recipients be relieved fromtheir obligations without either serving or paying back theamounts that you have given them in their awards?Mr. MILLER. We do not think that will be necessary.The CHAIRMAN. So the administration intends to substantiallyrevise the designation process for the Health Service manpowershortage areas?23 18Mr. MILLER. We cannot answer that at this time, Mr. Chairman.We recognize that it is an area that needs a careful look. We aretaking a careful look at it. We do agree with the approach that Ithink you are taking, to try and combine whatever the designationis, into one system of designation. But we have not yet completedour work.The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.The administration proposes to target money to support nursetraining, and to improve the registration and retention of regis-tered nurses. Yet the funding level proposed is well below myrecommendation of $30 million In fact, it is almost half, $15 mil-lion.Do you really believe this sum is realistic with the shortage ofnurses we have?Mr. MILLER. Well, Mr. Chairman, I know that you have heardthis discussion many times. I think our problem at this juncture isthat we really do not know what kind of programs will be mosteffective in getting at the problem of nursing. I think there isbeginning to be a cons nsus that the problem is not one of entryinto the nursing profess ion, but rather retention in the nursingprofession.We have a major study underway with the National Academy ofSciences, which is attempting to take a look at this, to determinewhat would be the most effective method of retaining nurses in theprofession Until then we believe that some of the previous pro-grams may be targeted at the wrong problem. But we recognizethis is a very difficult area that needs a lot of attention.The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.I have a large number of other questions that I would like tosubmit for the record.I am very pleased to have Senator Hawkins and Senator Nickleswith us here today.Senator Hawkins has agreed, in light of the problems that I haveright now, to chair these hearings further. I am very grateful toyou, Senator Hawkins. Why do you not move over to this chair?I appreciate you being here. I will submit those questions to you,and if you can get those back as soon as possible.Mr. MILLER. We will do that.Senator HAWKINS [presiding] Am I correct in my belief that theadministration supports training in nonphysician specialties, suchas physician assistants and nurse practitioners?Mr MILLER. Yes, we do, at a reduced level. But we will berecommending continuous support for both of those specialties.Senator HAWKINS. Do you know what level of support you arerecommending? Let us take the physician assistantsMr. MILLER. We would recommend a level of $5 million in fiscalyear 1982.Senator HAWKINS. $5 million in 1982?Mr. MILLER. That is for physican assistants.Senator HAWKINS. Nurse practitioner training?Mr. MILLER. $6.5 million for nurse practitioners. 19Senator HAwKINS. How much does each National Health ServiceCorps physician cost the Federal Government a year?Mr. Musa. May I ask Dr. Whiteside?Dr. WicrEsinE. It costs on the average about $53,000, if youinclude their salary and their cost of travel and moving theirfamilies to the sites.Senator HAWKINS. Salary plus expenses?Dr. WHITESIDE. Yes.Mr. MILLER. Of course, that is the initial cost, Senator. You saideach year. I think that Dr. Whiteside has included the initialstarting costs. On an annual basis that decreases.Senator HAWKINS. For each one. How many years are the physi-cians in the program?Dr. WHITESIDE. The cost for the people in the National HealthService Corps will drop over the number of years which they stayin the program. For example, you would subtract around $3,000 oftravel costs in subsequent years.Senator HAWKINS. Is geriatrics one of the national priority medical specialties that the administration wants to focus attention on?Mr. MILLER. I think selectively. For example, we are proposing asmall authorization for podiatrists. We will be, in the bill wesubmitthat very definitely is targeted toward special populations,articularly the elderly.Senator HAwKINS. Since those individuals that are 75 and overart... the fastest growing segment of our population, do you not thinkthat more emphasis should be placed on a study of geriatrics,perhaps a course for all doctors, as well as a specialty?Dr. GRAHAM. Madam Chairman, in addition to the response Mr.Miller has already made, in the preliminary care training pro-grams which we support, that you were referring to earlier, thefamily practice and pediatrics, we try to provide emphasis in thegrant awards to those programs which will emphasize the trainingin geriatrics, and care of the aging populations in their residencyprograms.Senator HAwxixs. I have no other questions.Senator Nickles, we will have his questions entered into therecord, as well.You can answer in writing, if you would.Thank you for coming today.[The prepared statem, nt of Mr. Miller follows:) 25 20 Of HEALTH HUMAN SLIV!CIS STAMEN? SY MILLER or SULTS AID IOWAN SERVICES [WORE TIE COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND SUMAS RESOORCES UNIT= STATES MEATS WEDNESDAY, APRIL S. ISIII 26 21 MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF TH3 COMMITTEE: It is a pleasure for me to appear before you today to present ourviews on the Federal rile in health professions education and onthe National Health Service Corps. The legislation you haveintroduced, S. 799 and S. 801, are in most respects similar to theproposals we will submit shortly, and we look forward to joiningyou in pursuit of our common goals. Over the past decade and a half, the Federal Government has playeda major role in the support of health professions education. Formost of this period, we sought to expand the Nation's capacityfor training the key professionals: physicians, dentists, nurses,public health personnel, and associated health professionals. Atthe time the programs were established, the outlook was for seriousnational shortages of health professionals to mc/t rising demandsfor care. As Secretary Schweiker discussed with you last week, the Federalprograms to increase the aggregate supply of physicians and otherhealth providers have been extraordinarily successful. Since 1970,for example, the annual numoer of graduates from medical schools hasincreased from 9,000 to over 15,000. We now have in place sufficienttraining capacity to produce the required number cf health professionals, in total, for just about every major discipline. 27 22 - 2 - Yet there still are shortages of health prlfessionals incertain geographic areas and in certain specialties.Individuals from minority and other disadvantaged backgroundscontinuo to be seriously underrepresented in the healthprofessions.The Administration believes that there is acontinuing role for the Federal Government in helping overcomethese and other special health professions problems. Like you, we propose to end support for most general institutionalassistance.This includes support in the form of capitation grants,start-up grants, and construction programs. These are the programsthat have contributed so substantially to the expansion of theNation's health professions training resources. At a time ofsevere economic constraints, large general subsidies are not thebest means for meeting those priority needs that still must beaddressed on a Federal level. As would your bill, we would also promote an increase in thesupply of primary care physicians through continued support oftraining in family medicine, general internal medicine, andpediatrics.Since 1972, Federal grant funds have been used tostimulate the development of primary care training programs andresidencies.A larger percentage of physicians now chooseprimary care specialties, and primary care has become an 28 23 3- established educational programmedical schools. Continued supporeasonable balance between primaryin the curricula of manyrt will help to achieve acare and other specialties. In order to further improve the dist ribution of health pro-Cossionals, and thereby ensure that peor undorserved areas have better acceswe propose to continue support for AreaCenter (AHEC) programs.

Toa limited extent, aid also should he authorized for traineeshipsto public health students. Me propose the establishment of a new program to encourage thecontinued growth of important preventive health activitiesthrough the development of preventive medicine departments andpreventive medicine residency training programs. Your hill wouldinclude preventive medicine training as one of the types oftraining that might be supported under the public health specialproject authority. The problems faced in the area of nurse training and the availabilityof nurses are somewhat different from the problems of health pro-fessions training and availability generally. Although there hasbeen significant growth in the number of active registered nurses,it is also clear that there are troublesome vacancies and shortagesin some of the least favorable facilities, settings, or shifts. 3 0 25 - 5 - Among the reasons for nursing shortages appear to be inadequatesalaries and fringe benefits, lack of career ladders to providemobility between levels of skill, and lack of flexibility inscheduling hours and night and shift work without adequatesalary differentials. In certain types of facititios, les aresmiting a number of nurses leaving settings such as intensivecare unfits and other emotionally and physically taxing settings. Ws propose to target nurse training support through specialproject awards designed to improve the distribution andretention of registered nurses. We would *stand support forcontinuing education programs, particularly those emphasizingbedside nursing, primary care, and prevention. We propose tocontinue support for nurse practitioner training and to increasenursing education opportunities among individuals from disadvantagedbackgrounds. In a limited number of other health professions program areas, weplan to carry out initiatives of special national interest.Examples of such areas inlcude education and training of alliedhealth personnel for health promotion and disease prevention,develop curriculum and training for podiatrists and help moot 31 the foot care needs of special population groupa such as theelderly, and curriculum improvements in schools of veterinarymedicine. Like you, we recognize the need for additional information onhealth professions supply and requirements as a basin for soundpolicy devalopment. We propose to continue the authority formonitoring and analyzing health professions data. This wouldinclude the development and refinement of estimates of currentand future health professions supply, requirements, anddistribution.We would continue special activities begun underthe Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee toidentify, coordinate, and analyze medical specialty requirements. I would emphasize that this Administration sees its role inrelation to health professions education as being one ofcooperation with State and local governments, educationalinstitutions, the professions, and others to accomplish nationalpriority goals. Student Assistance Programs Current law provides for a number of student assistance programs,including the Health Professions Student Loan (HPSL) Program,the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) Program, the 27 -7- Exceptional financial Need (EFN) Scholarship Program, theLoan Repayment Program, the Nursing Student Loan (NSW Programand Nursing Scholarships. In addition, health professionsstudents are eligible for both Guaranteed Student Loans (GSL)and National Direct Student Loans (NDSL) offered through theDepartment of Education. All of these programs have servedthe country voll, and at a tin* when there was a shortage ofphysicians and other health care providers there vas a cogentrationale for supporting students desirous of a health professionseducation.Times have changed, however. Many student assistance programs, while meritorious, cannotwithstand the careful scrutiny which all programs must undergoat a time when there is a mandate from the American people toreduce federal spending. As part of the President's overalleffort to be responsive to that mandate, it becomes verydifficult to justify subsidising the education of individualswho in the aggregate become some of the highest income earnersin the country. Thus, the student assistance programs forhealth professions students outlined in the President's budget 83-520 0 -81 -333 28 - 8 - would eliminate subsidies for most students. It is on thisbasis that the Administration can fully support the provisionsin your companion bill, S. 799, which will eliminate theScholarships for Students of Exceptional Financial Need andNursing Scholarships. Although the Administration will no longer provide generalsubsidies for health professions students, we believe that someprogram reforms are needed so that a health professions careeris not limited tc the more affluent members of our society. Inorder to reduce the cost to the Federal Government and stillcontinue to offer disadvantaged students an opportunity for ahealth professions education without undertaking a major financialobligation or a service obligation, the Administration is consideringa proposal to make market rate SEAL loans more attractive to thesestudents.Disadvantaged students who do not complete their schoolingwould have the loan repaid by the Federal Government, in effectconverting it to a scholarship. Those students who complete schoolwould be responsible for repaying the loan. This approach wouldprovide disadvantaged students with the same opportunity as an erNscholarship, but the Federal Government would only be subsidizingthose low income students who do not succeed academically. 34 29 -9 - The Health Professions Student Loan and Nursing Student LoanPrograms are need-based and were initially authorized in thaHealth Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1963P.L. 88-129) and the Nurse Training Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-581)and are administered by the schools through a revolving fund.Dollars that were initially appropriated by the FederalGovernment are continually recycled by the institution, thusaaximizing the use of the Federal dollar. Because of theimportance of these funds to the schools, the Administrationendorses your recommendation that the funds already appropriatedcontinue to be reloaned, but that no new funds be eitherauthorised or appropriated. However, we believe that therevolving loan money should be used for disadvantaged studentswho may have difficulty securing a bank loan. The Administration also supports the changes you propose forthe HEAL Program. With no additional appropriation for thetwo student loan programs and the repeal of GEN, HEAL willbecome the principal student assistance program for healthprofessions students. Created in 1976, this FederallyGuaranteed Loan Program had some problems initially gettingunder way.A series of amendments, however, passed since itscreationthe most recent being P.L. 96-538, signed into lawon December 17, 1980, and which authorized lenders to charge 35 30 - 10 - borrowers T-bill plus 3-1/2 percent with no ceiling--have madethe program attractive to major lenders including Chas*Manhattan, the principal lender to date, and now Citibank, thesecond largest bank in the country. Although the HEAL Program is becoming increasingly viable ascurrently authorized, several provisions will enhance theprogram considerably, including: --raising the borrowing limits to offset increasingtuitions; removing the current restriction limiting the percentof students eligible for HEAL Loans in a given institutionto 50 percent. The Administration supports all of these changes but will recommendas well that HEAL Loans be made available to nursing students. Itis our view that the incorporation of these changes into thePresent program will ensure the continued availability of loanfunds for health professions students. National Health Service Corns: (Scholarship and Field Placement Program) The National Health Service Corps and 4s related scholarshipprogram were originally designed to provide a mechanism for :36 31 the ?sclera' Government to guarantee the availability of healthcare providers in the underserved areas of this country. Inexchange for a scholarship to finance a health professionseducation, upon completion of their education scholarshiprecipients would be required to provide at least two yearsof service in undersorved areas. Simultaneous with the inception of the NHSC and scholarshipprogram, the Federal Government provided medical and otherhealth professions schools with incentives to train morephysicians and other health professionals in order to addressthe physician shortage problem. With the growing surplus ofphysicians there is strong evidence that they are beginning tomigrate to some of the more rural f this country. Whatis now critical, however, is to adjust the projected fieldstrength of the Corps in order to provide health care to thoseareas of the country where all available evidence would indicatephysicians and other health providers will not choose to locate.It is on this basis that the Administration is planning for aprojected and stable field strength of 2,500 and is pleased tosee that you, Mr. Chairman, concur with that judgment.In orderto reach that 2,500, the Administration will recommend that theawarding of new scholarships and recruitment of volunteers besuspended until at least 1983 when additional personnel will beneeded to maintain the 2,500 field strength. Coupled with these 32 - 12 - changes, the Administration would: --Permit the private practice option to continue withadditional flexibility to permit the establishment ofpractice in shortage areas: --Continue the Secretary's discretion to offer one-time start-up grants of $25,000 to both Corps obligors who are newlyavailable for service and obligors who have completedtheir service and are willing to establish a private practicein high priority underserved areas, --Continue placement of Corps obligors with State and localgovernments: --Continue to allow the Secretary to designate DoD and VAinstallations as shortage areas and as such placing assigneesin these institutions: --Continue to allow students to buy out of their serviceobligation. In summary, Mr. Chairman, the Administration generally supports thethrust of S. 801. As I think you will agree the National HealthService Corps has had and continues to have a very important 38 33 - 13- function to performthat of providing health care to thetruly underserved areas of this countrywhile at the sametime encouraging the delivery of medical care to these areasthrough the private sector wherever possible. To accomplishthat goal. efforts need to be directed at reducing the six*of the scholarship program so that the number of scholarshipsis more in line with the needs of the Corps and to ensure thata field strength of 2500 can be maintained in the future. Conclusion In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, the Administration is in the processof drafting its own health professions legislation, and we areencouraged by the bills you have introduced. We look forward toworking with you on this important legislation. We will be pleasedto try to answer any questions you may have. 39 34 .r,717.711181 Opinion Forum: Motllyn L Dyer, RNr- I; 0;1.1.`Diploma Iwould like wey reseertsby wades the I term been thedksetre a/ s diploma school of aurs-lag foe 10 ran beton that. anIS.StrUCIOtlatheschoolfoe cermet NanceAssociation% (M A',) 1993 EntryImo Practice perm!

BILLYE BROWN, DEAN, SCHOOL OF NURSING, UNIVERSI-TY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN, A PANELSister JOANNE. First I want to say it is a privilege to be here. Iknow that time seems to be of the essence. Before everybodyleaves, I want to get started.As a hospital administrator and an employer of nurses at all,levels of education and experience, it is my intent to be pragmaticin my testimony today. I will speak about what works in the day-to-day operation of the good general hospitalthe one I want to goto when I get sick. We are in trenches living with how it really is.Our mission is to provide compassionate, high-quality care on aday-today basis, around the clock, in a very complex medicalarena.We are experiencing a serious to acute shortage of nurses inUtah, as well as across the Nation. To dispute this fact is to denyreality. The hospitalis the major employer of nurses. We areclosing needed programs, denying care to inpatients and outpa-tients, and failing to serve the sick among us due to a manpowershortage in many places. We have closed nursing units because weare unable to recruit nurses to staff these units.I agree with what was said previously, one of the major problemsis retention. But that is just one of the major problems. That it notthe whole story.I am dividing my testimony into four categories:One: What kind of nurses do hospitals need?Two: How can we provide for stability in our nursing staff?Three: Are qualified candidates available? Are young and middleaged motivated to become career nurses?Four: Has the hospital directly contributed to the nurse short-age? Can this be reversed?Issue 1: What kind of nurses do hospitals need?Being fully aware of this as a nurse and administrator for moreyears than I would like to say publicly, the role of nurses, theacuity of patient illness today, the complexity of highly specializedservices, for example, intensive care, the manpower needs of thelong-term care facilities, the maldistribution of nurses and doctors,the liability and malpractice risk are things we must be aware of.I firmly believe that in order to barely meet the demands madeon hospitals, we must make haste to prepare nurses at all fivelevels of basic nursing education. the LPN [technical], [technical], the RN [diploma graduate], the baccalau-reate degree nurse, the masters degree nurse, and the midwife.43 This position has had the support of the National League ofNurses, the American Medical Association, the American HospitalAssociation, the Catholic Health Association, of which I am thechairman, and the Association of Community and Junior Colleges.The key responsibility of hospital administration and manage-ment is to provide the right mixcompetencies necessary to excel-lence in patient carea climate that responds to what is best forthe patient.Issue 2: How can we provide for stability in our nursing staff?Hospital nursing is an end producta careerit is not a step-ping stone. Our expectations have been in conflict of late.Present and past experience demonstrates that in a great manyhospitals, the professional registered nurse, the RN, is the back-bone of the hospital nursing staff. I quote other hospital adminis-trators across the country.They are at the bedsideThey have a high degree of flexibility and a broad scope of understanding regard-ing the 24-hour, 7-day-a-week operation of the hospital.They have a strong work ethic, their expectations of their jobs are realistic, theyshare the common goals of the hospitalNursing is their career They demonstrate a high level of judgment, leadership,competence in the nursing process, in assessing, planning, implementing and evalu-ating patient careThat is the end of the quotes.Nursing is an applied science which includes academic prepara-tion together with practical clinical experience. Professional regis-tered nursesdiploma- -who qualify for licensure by passing thesame State board examinations, the diploma programs I am talkingabout, as do the nurses from collegiate programs, are capable offunctioning as beginning practitioners Because they have had ex-tensive experience in the hospitals and they need little orientationto their role as a registered nurse. They are capable of meetingimmediate staffing needs within the hospital. By contrast, theusual orientation needed to integrate the baccalaureate nurse ofteninvolves an inservice program lasting several months. This be-comes a cost factor. Nurses who sat for the 1980-81 examinationfrom our diploma school in Columbus, Ohio, passed in the top 30pei cent of all students from seven schools in the State and abovethe national average for the United States.There is general cause for alarm that some would program thediploma nurse for extinction. At Holy Cross Hospital in Salt LakeCity, we have had the misfortune of not being able to hire any newdiploma graduate for over 3 years. We have 111 diploma nurses atpresent, one-third of our staff. Local hospitals have collaboratedwith Weber State College to support an associate degree programto increase manpower. Holy Cross reimburses for RN's working fulltime for their advanced education.We provide partial scholarships to beginning students at WeberState. We believe these measures do provide stability.Issue 3: Are qualified candidates available? Are the young andmiddle aged motivated to become career nurses?Yes, if we provide alternatives, ways and means, offer a varietyof programs that make it possible to choose nursing as a career bythose persons who can or cannot handle 4 years of college, thosewho must become self-supporting quickly, those who desire a 44 39second career, or in numerous other situations demanding flexibil-ity.We continue to build blocks and expect people to fit in. We mustprovide innovative approaches. Major recruitment. Nontraditionalstudents, for example, midlife careers. Provide night and weekendprograms. Expand faculty. Change the image and the integrity ofthe diploma graduate. Subsidi-,e multilevel programs in ratio relat-ed to need, to job opportunities.Twenty-nine diploma schools in Ohio provide Ohio hospitals with80 percent of the nursing staff in each hospital. We have twohospitals in Ohio. The for-profit hospitals and nursing homes uti-lize nurses and physicians, and make no contribution to their edu-cational preparation.Presently, older, more mature women are entering these pro-grains and they bring special ability and gifts to the nursing profes-sion that we have not had before.There is a job marketthere is unemploymentwe have to getour act together.Issue 4: Has the hospital directly contributed to the nurse short-age? Can this be reversed?Yes. We closed diploma schools of nursing. Many were forced outby the heavy financial burden on patients which we could notjustify.Historically, the private not-for-profit hospitals have been thegreatest supporters of both medical and nursing education. Thiscommitment is based on the fact that quality care is greatly en-hanced through these programs. We also believe in preparing forthe future health care of the people of our country. The clinicalladder for nurses provides incentive to stay at the bedside. Thissystem defines four levels, provides advancement for the RN, whileallowing her to stay at the bedside. The nurse receives a salaryincrease with each advancemert, as well as more responsibility anda status promotion. Heretofore the traditional promotion was tosupervisor to teacher to administrator, and each step was furtheraway from the bedside. I think we are living to regret that. Theygot nearer to the desk and the multimeeting syndrome.These four levels of the clinical ladder are based on well docu-mented programs of learning and evaluation of clinical excellence,knowledge, and practice.The cost of education is overwhelming.The professional status and integrity of the diploma nurse andthe LPN has been under fire.We are on the threshold of literally throwing the baby out withthe bath water in the presence of rather sterile parents.Can we turn ourselves around? I believe we can and will, and insome instances we have begun. We need support in doing soWe must reinstate the hospital diploma program and be open tolook at other alternatives of delivering quality care.We must make nursing education more relevant, more accessi-ble, oriented to patient needs, to the needs of the career nurse.As the major employers of nurses, hospitals shol.ld become moreaccountable for influencing relevant curriculum development forthe nursing profession at all levels.Q5-. D 40We must deal radically with the dissatisfiers for nurses withinour hospitals by providing opportunities such as:Clinical ladder for their advancement in education and skillsoffer options. We found some new ways of doing that. I will nottake your time to go into them today.Primary care nursingWholistic care for patients.Improve the nurse/physician relationshipresolve conflict.Assure equitable wage and benefit programs that are cost effu:-tive in reducing turnover.To recap the challenge to hospitals, in rather simplistic, briefterms:Support all levels of nursing education as it relates to the hospi-tal's mission of providing compassionate, quality care to the sick.Hospitals must seek a controlling influence in the planning fornursing manpower on a short- and long-range basis, especiallysince 80 percent of nursing manpower is in hospitals.Open up to nontraditional, innovative ways of providing qualitycare.Be vocal and unified in dealing with our present plight. Thehealth of our fellow man comes first.I would like to say a couple more paragraphs about turnover,about my experience of turnover, and my whole thrust is geared towhat my experience and the experience of others is in hospitaladministration.The national norm for turnover ranges from 35 to 64 percent fornurses. Holy Cross Hospital has been 33 percent for 2 years anddropping. Radical change in the past month has occurred, and Iattribute much of the change to primary care, which is a satisfierfor nurses. There is a great reduction in medication errors andtreatment errors. Since the units that we began as a pilot studyhave converted to primary care, there is no turnover on theseunits. The shift differential for holidays and weekends has beenincreased. These are some factors that change the lifestyle ofnurses, and they go into other professions for these reasons.For instance, on holidays, our nurses are paid 2' /z times theusual wage. But they get no holiday in lieu of that holiday. This iscost containment considering the cost of turnover and closing bedsWe have got to put more dollars and planning into the wage andsalary programs for this reason.On weekends, we have 12-hour shifts 2 days, and we pay for 40hours. Since we have done that we have had no problem coveringweekends.Our current turnover, in the last 6 months, has dropped to 10percent. That 10 percent we can attribute to nurses who are mar-ried to physicians who leave town, et cetera.Our present position is that we only have openings for two full-time equivalents. That is it. However, we will need even more RN'sduring 1981-82, as we convert the rest of the units in primary care.I am going to end there. I think you have the gist of what I haveto say. I believe very strongly in these issues, and I will discussthem with anyone who cares to discuss them.Senator HAwKINS. Since you have a tight timeframe, we will askquestions of you, and then go to the other witnesses. Please be46 41thinking of summarizing your statements while we ask questions ofSister JoAnne.Nurses play a very important role in reducing health care costs.In Florida, 67 percent of our registered nurses work in hospitals.But the competition is so severe that one hospital in Hollywood,Fla., became innovative enough to offer a $35,000 a year salary,and took out ads to advertise the nursing positions available.While I feel that nurse are deserving of more adequate salariesthan they have been receiving, and there should be some attentionplaced on their surroundings, I am concerned about the effect thisis going to have on the cost of health care.Do you feel that expending Federal funds now on nurse trainingprograms will have a long-term saving in health care costs?Sister JOANNE. Yee, I do. I think that the fund allocation has tobe carefully handled. I think there has to be a real commitment toprograms, and close controls.Senator HAWKINS. Do you have any questions?Do you have any questions of Sister JoAnne?Senator KENNEDY. Yes.Sister, I welcome you here to the committee. We have seen overa period of recent years where at least the previous administrationfelt that we had sufficient nurses in the country; that was a greatdispute between HEW and OMB and this committee.The time that Secretary Califano appeared, I put on the tableabout a foot-high's worth of newspaper advertisements for nursesall across this country. There appears to continue to be a shortageof nurses, and I think that is seen in every major communityacross this country, in the rural areas as well as in urban areas.So,I think itis important that in fashioning and shaping ahealth care system, we are going to be able to be assured of anadequate supply of nurses I think that is in our Nation's interest.I am going to ask some questions of the panel and I would beinterested in knowing what you believe will be the impact of theadministration's budget cuts in terms of the future of nurse train-ing. What will it mean? Will young, committed women and menlook to it as a career opportunity-? What do you think will be theresult of these budget cuts?Sister JOANNE. I think the budget cuts will be a real deterrent.Senator KENNEDY. Why will they be a deterrent?Sister JOANNE. Well, it is not that they do not want to go intonursing, they cannot finance it. We give minimal scholarships tostudents from Weber State. I am talking about $200 or $300, and ithelps them to make the decision that, yes, they do want to go intonursing With the other changes that we are making in terms ofthe career ladder, the chance for advancement, and some choiceswithin the profession women are attracted to the profession.We already have people who want to come into nursing but whoare unabl,- to because they cannot finance it, and I think we aregoing to compound that problem.Senator KENNEDY. Will that not mean that the sons and daugh-ters of wealthier people will go in their place, or do you think therewill just be vacancies? What would be the result if just the wealthycould go into nursing? 42Sister JOANNE. Disastrous. There will be vacancies. The otherproblem is that there are so many other careers that are availableto women, and women are the primary people who go into nursing.The other careers are more attractive. You know, if there is in-stant independence and instant \"having my own money,\" whyshould I spend 3 or 4 years waiting for something that might notbe all that great? I think those are deterring factors.Senator KENNEDY. Let me just ask, finally, what do you think isthe responsibility of the Federal Government in terms of increas-ing the numbers of nurses which are needed in the country?Sister JOANNE. I think it has to be a joint working together, ajoint venture. I think we both need to be responsible for it. I didmention that we have another serious problem, and I know this isan unpopular topic, but itis with the investor-owned hospital,which assume no responsibility for education and use the nurses.So, they do not have a commitment to education, plus they arecreaming us at the top by taking patients. It is expedient for thefor-profit hospital to take care of certain categories of patientsbecause the reimbursement is excellent.So, we have two problems here. We are going to have less moneyin nonprofit hospitals at the local level even before we get the cutsfrom the Federal Government.Senator KENNEDY. Madam Chairman, could I just get reactionsto those two questions.Senator HAwEiNs. Surely.Senator KENNEDY. Those would be the only two questions that Iwould ask of the other two panelists.Dr. COLLINS. I will address, Senator Kennedy, your first question,\"What do you think the impact will be of the cutbacks?\" I thinkthe impact will be drastic. We have depended for some time onsupport money for education for nursing, especially as we moveinto higher education and academic settings, there is a need forsupport.Students at this moment are anticipating dropping out of nurs-ing programs, expecting cutbacks, which will further deplete thenumbers that are pursuing nursing education. This indicates awaste of money already expended. The student will not be able tocontinue, or will continue on a part-time basis, which will againfurther deplete the numbers available for early employment.Senator KENNEDY. You all agree with me that there is a shortageof nurses nationwide, certainly. Do you all agree?Dr. COLLINS. Yes.Dr. BROWN. Yes.Sister JOANNE. Yes.Senator KENNEDY. I gather from your testimony that these kindsof budget cuts will probably make that shortage more acute?Sister JOANNE. Yes.Dr. COLLINS. We believe so.Senator KENNEDY. And then I would be interested if you wouldbriefly describe what you think the Federal responsibility is. I think the sister indicated that it is a form of pat tnership.Would you respond to that question?Dr. BROWN. 1 would be glad to, Senator. I think that it is apartial responsibility of the Federal Government because the48 43health of the Nation is very important to the quality of life in theNation. It is impossible, as the sister and Dr. Collins both havesaid, for a student to pay the entire cost of education.Many of our students will be working more than they are work-ing presently to supplement what private funds they have, whichmeans that this will extendthe length of time they are in nursingschools, which will further complicate the already existing shortageof nurses.Senator KENNEDY. You would agree with that?Dr. Cozen s. Absolutely. I think, also, the stress on the employedstudents and with the heavy expectation of academic studies, thedropout rate would increase. We find in education that the morethey have to work to supplement income, the less time they canattribute to the educational process. As a result, they become moretired, more depressed, more discouraged.Senator KENNEDY. Well, I appreciate the comments. We haveseen in the medical schools,with the withdrawal of institutionalsupport and individual support, an increasing burden on the stu-dent as well as on the institution. There are generally three wellqualified students for medical education for every one that is ac-cepted.I do not know quite what it is with regard to the nursing schools,but what we are going to see is that medical education in thiscountry is going to be reserved for only the sons and daughters ofthe wealthiest individuals in this country, rather than being clear-ly broad based, as I think the health care system should be interms of being truly representative of our society.1 am wondering if this is going to be a problem among the nursestoo, that it is only going to be the sons and daughters of moreaffluent people that are going to be able to choose that career and,by putting on this financial limitation, excluding talented, commit-ted, compassionate young people whose parents do not have thoseresources.Dr. COLLINS. Could I just respond to that briefly, Senator?I recently heard an address by Eli Ginsberg, who reported, thatwith the declining birth rate in this country and the potential needfor more students to enter the health professions, we are going tosee fewer numbersavailable to pursue nursing education. We willsee the stable populationcoming out of the minority groups, thepoor, and the underprivileged. When we look at that grouping ofpeople available to pursue health careers, there is gong to have tobe some financial support for the very reason that you have sug-gested. Only those with money will have access to nursing pro-grams. There will be otheroptions that have a faster turnaroundthan the nursing career would provide. I think this is a majorconcern and, again, a reason to support Government funding foreducation.Dr. BROWN. I agree with that. I do not have anything to add.Senator KENNEDY. I hope you will extend my best wishes toConnie Halleran.Dr. COLLINS. We will; thank you.Senator KENNEDY. She has appeared here before; she was aspokesperson for the Nurses' Association. She was here before the 83-520 0-81--4 44committee on a number of different occasions and worked very closely with us on a wide range of different health policy :ssues. Dr. BROWN. We appreciate that.Senator KENNEDY. I know she is in Geneva.Senator HAWKINS. Sister JoAnne, you may be excused since you have the travel problem.Sister JOANNE. Thank you very much.Senator HA.wxixs. Dr. Collins, could you summarize your state- ment?Dr. COLLINS. Yes, I will try to summarize my statement. Senator HAWKINS. We will enter the full statement in the record. Dr. COLLINS. Pardon?Senator HAWKINS. We are going to enter your full statement in the record.Dr. COLLINS. Thank you; I understand that to be true. I would just like to prefacemy remarks with the fact that I am here representing the National League for Nursing and the Ameri- can Nurses' Association in a consolidated front, as they, in concert with the nursing population and the nursing community, have established this testimony in support of the request for funding for nursing education.I would like to address several issues. One of them is the need for graduate and advanced training for nursing personnel. It is very crucial in this time of advanced technology, and requirement for quality care that nurses be prepared to meet the needs ofan aging population, the deprived and rural areasthat we have available, competent practitioners of nursing who can serve cost effectively in these specialty fields.We see today the health needs of an increasing aging population and the resulting concerns, that nurses are leaving the nursing profession at a time of crisis. I would like to address this issue because I think it is crucial to ar understanding of where our nursing practitioners andour nursi,,g population is needed.The ANA, in a 1977-78 inventoey ...,f registered nurses, indicated that of the 1.4 million RN's currently holding active license, 75 percent of those are still employed in nursing. Of the 25 percent not working in nursing and not working at all, about one-fourth are over 54 years of age. Another 43 percent are under the age of 40; that is, the agerange commonly associated with child-bearingand child-rearing years. Thus, the activity rate of nurses is closely associated with age, and we need to recognize that. According to data obtained by the National League for Nursing, just over 95 percent of the registered nurses newly employed in 1978 were working in nursing 6 to 8 months after graduation. I am therefore suggesting that the population of nursing does indicate an interest in retaining their activity in the nursing profession, yet we need to increase our numbers.We know the technology required in intensive care areas, the serious nature of respiratorycare, acute shock trauma units, andthe whole category of intensive care units, which today require three times as many nurses to staff as they have in the past. We know that without advanced preparation, nurses are not prepared to deal with the highly technical needs of patients in these particu- lar specialties.J0 45Estimates of shortage of over 100,000 nurses in hospitals alonehave been indicated, and we recognize that this number is expand-ed with nursing homes and community service needs. We believethat cuts of the size proposed in Federal support for nursing educa-tion would cripple many programs, especially at the graduate level.I would like to add to my testimony a statement that summarizeswhy I believe, that graduate and advanced education is necessary.In a 1977 surveyand this is a quote from the Journal of PublicHealth Policy, December 1980, submitted by Claire Fagan, suggest-ing changes occurring in nursing roles and functions to be asfollows:Several tasks were performed more often by nurses with higher levels of formaleducation than by nurses with leas education A significantly higher percentage ofregistered nurses with baccalaureates than with diplomas or associate degrees ob-tained health histories, performed portions of physicals exams, selected a plan oftreatment, developed therapeutic plans for patients, instructed patients in manage-ment of a defined illness, instructed and counseled patients and families in healthpromotion and maintenance, and had primary responsibility for following throughon patient care routines.The reason I am making this an emphasis is that one of the mostexpensive commodities in hospital nursing today is the nurse aide.When we look at the better prepared nurse, we are discoveringthat the nurse with advanced preparation can do all tasks and doesnot experience downtime while others are performing tasks thatshe is not licensed or prepared to do.So, cost containment effortthe whole thrust of realizing moreeff,:ctive utilization of the resources of nursingcan be establishedby the better prepared nurse leaderNursing administrators with advanced preparation can deter-mine where the most effective assignment of the nurse resourcescan be made in these agencies. This is important to support theclaim that higher degrees in education for nursing is essential tothe quality of patient care and the maximum use of personnel.Since the inception of the Nurse Training Act in 1964, thedemand for nurses with advanced degrees has continued to begreater than the ability of schools to prepare nurses at advancedlevels. Any action that would decrease this ability in these times offinancial constraint would prove disastrous to nursing efforts toprepare qualified professionals.We understand that special projects and other moneys for nursetraining have been included and retained in the bill that has beenproposed. We salute this supportive move and certainly are incomplete agreement with it.However, there is one area that is under consideration to berepealed, and that is the repeal of section 215 \"Delegation.\" It ispremature at this time. The nursing shortage is a nationwideshortage and not merely geographic in nature. Thus, it is impor-tant that nursing nationally be involved in the decision to distrib-ute funds and be available to advise relative to how these fundscould best be utilized.It is unlikely that this shortage will be relieved to any greatextent during the next 3 years. A major concern about the repealof section 215 relates to the potential dilution of a national nursingperspective which includes the assessment and review of total na-tional needs and the planning for adequate national resources.51 46Since nursing is a national resource, decentralization in the face of a continuing nationwide shortage would only aggravate the currentcritical situation.We appreciate the need to hold the line on Federal spending in these inflationary times. However, given the scope and goal of this legislation, we do not believe that the authorization levels are adequate and we would request your thoughtful attention to this matter.I think this summarizes the major aspects of my testimony in regard to moneys for advanced training for nursing in an academic setting.[The prepared statement and responses to questions submitted to Dr. Collins follow:] 52 47 AMERICAN NURSES' ASSOCIATION andNATIONAL LEAGUE FOR NURSING Testimony on S. 799Health Professions Educational Assistanceand Nurse Training Act April 8, 1981 to Senate Labor R Human Resources Committee By Or. Verla CollinsDirector, Intermountain Health Care AssociationSalt Lake City, Utah 53 48 H2. Chairman, I am Dr. Verla Collins, director of the Inter-mountain Health Care Association in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am pleased to be here today on behalf of the American Nurses'Association and National League for Nursing to present testimony onS. 799 presently before this committee. Nurses indeed support the government's effort to combat inflationthrough budgetary restraint; and we understand the strong popularmandate to obtain a better balance between productivity and the supplyof public services. Yet, a failure to provide adequate health care tothe people of this nation represents a serious threat to the qualityof society as a whole. The health care of our country serves as abarometer for how we Americans deal with the human phenomena thattouch us -- pain, suffering, disability, and dying. If the -Irrentcritical shortage of nurses is allowed to continue, it will bringunacceptable consequences for many individuals. Fspecially ac a timewhen commitment to a position of strong national defense is high, thegovernment must have a vital interest in maintaining an adequatesupply of nurses. 54.....1 49 -2- Predictions vs. RealityThe nature and scope of demands for nursing services have changeddramatically in recent years. Although between 1958 and 1980 thenumber of active nurses more than tripled, and the ratio of activenurses to 100,000 population nearly doubled, today we are faced with1what is being termed an acute nursing shortage. There is a widely held perception by present and past Admin-istrations that the nursing shortage would be solved if inactivenurses returned to work. We do not agree with this assumption. TheANA 1977 Inventory of Registered Nurses, indicated that of the 1.4million RNs currently holding active licenses, 75 percent are employedin nursing.Of the 25 percent not working at all, about one-fourth areover 54 years of age. Another 43 percent of this group are under theage of forty, those years most commonly associated with childbearing2and child rearing. Thus, the activity rate of nurses is very stronglyassociated with age. According to data obtained by the NationalLeague for Nursing, Just over 95 percent of registered nurses newlyemployed in 1978 were working in nursing six to eight months after3graduation. Declines in GraduationsWe cannot emphasize too strongly that a drastic decrease infederal funds for nursing education would pose a grave and unnecessaryrisk to people of this nation. There is every reason to believe thatthe situation will grow increasingly worse. The latest NLN datademonstrateshat the downtrend in admissions, graduation, and enroll-ments to schools of nursing that began in 1976 is worsening. Thcre 50 -3- will be a 3 percent drop in graduations from RN programs in 1981;admissions and enrollments will be down 2 percent. This future decrease in supply must be considered in light of theBureau of Labor statistics projections that the explosive growth inthe health care system has created a need for 85,000 new registerednurses annually through 1990. Further, the demand for skilled nursingcare will undoubtedly continue to rise, fueled by advances in medicaltechnology, the proliferation of labor-intensive critical-care units,and the aging population. Demand for Nursing ServicesIn settings which required ten RNs to staff an intensive careunit in 1970, there are now three intensive care units --one forcardiac problems, one for kidney disorders, and one for brain scan-ning -- and three times as many nurses are required.A 40 percentincrease in various kinds of intensive care units in the nation,coupled with a steep rise in medical technology, has dramaticallyincreased -- not only the need for nurses --but for more nurses withspecial training. Moreover, as pressures to lower hospital costs havetended to limit care to the very sick, more nurses are needed to carefor a rapid turnover of intensely ill patients. The number of long-term care facilities has multiplied as thedemand for health care services by the elderly population has increased.The demand is expected to continue in the future as life expectancyIncreases.The number of nursing home residents during 1973-74 was1,075,800.By 1977, this figure had risen by 21 percent to 1,303,100. 56 51 -4- This increase can be attributed, in part, to the growing proportion of4persons 85 years of age and over. In addition, long-term care hasexpanded to include both institutional and non-institutional health care services. Institutional DemandThe most significant increase in demand for nurses has occurrredwithin the hospital setting. With the emphasis on removal of financialbarriers to health care during the 1960's, hospital utilization increasedAs a result of the enactment of the Hill-Burton Act, many hospitalswere enlarged and more medical facilities were built. The addition ofmore hospital beds signaled the need for more nurses. Estimates of a shortage of over 103,000 nurses in hospitalsalone, and information in news media all over the country testify to the severity and widespread nature of the problem. In the state of Utah there are currently budgetPdvacancies of 1,400 registered nurses. Some south-western hospitals are offering bonuses of glamorousapartments at low rents, free use of an automobile,or cash awards up to $4,000 to lure nurses ontotheir staffs. In Massachusetts the latest estimate cites 2,500 unfi*.lednursing positions. 5 7 52 -5- In the New York City area alone there are over 1,100 staffnurse vacancies; in some floors in Bellevue Hospital thereis only one practical nurse and an aide covering an entirefloor. Need for Nurses with Advanced DegreesWhile the nursing shortage seems to have reached intolerableproportions in many institutional settings, the most grave situationby far is the shortage of nurses with advanced educatonai preparation.In view of the increasing technological sophistication and complexityof health care, many nursing skills require special educational prep-aration.More nurses with master's and doctoral degrees are needed,especially iii nursing service, educational administration, research,and as clinical specialists. Clinicians:Clinical specialists for intensive care units such as renal,coronary care, and trauma care are necessary. Directors of nursingservices report a serious scarcity cf highly skilled registerednurses, especially these prepared to care for critically ill persons.Further, many nurses are presently practicing in underserved areas,providing care to populations that would not otherwise have access tohealth services: In situaticns of this nature, where a high degree 53 -6- of professional judgement must be exercised, it is absolutely essentialthat the nurse have the necessary educational background. Educators:Other professions have long ago established the importance ofadvanced education, and nursing is not an exception to this standard.To maintain the quality and quantity of direct patient care requiredfrom nurses, nursing students must be taught by nurses with advanceddegrees. According to data collected by the National League for Nursingin January, 1978, a total of 20,217 full-time and 4,457 part-timenurse faculty members were employed in 1,358 R.N. education programs.There were 800 unfilled budgeted positions, 24 more than reported inJanuary 1976.Of all the full-time nurse faculty reported as employedin R.N. programs, only 5.3 percent held the doctorate, and 62.5 percentthe master's degree. 5 Administrators:Nearly half 148.1 percent) of nursing service administrators donot hold even a baccalaureate. Yet nursing service administrators -ustassume responsibility for 40-60 percent of a hospital's budget and33-50 percent of its personnel. Only advanced education can preparenurses to provide leadership in responsible fiscal management, indevelopment (4f standards and quality assurance programs, in applicationof patient classification systems, in use of computers to projectplans and predict consequences, in development of research in practiceand operations, and in promotion of exemplary learning opportunitiesfor staff and students. 5y 54 -7- Researchers:More nurses with advanced preparation also are needed to addressthe complex problems concerning quality and delivery of care. Intimes of cat containment, innovations are needed. But innovationsmust be teted scientifically,which requires more nurses educated atthe doctoral level Lo design instruments and methodologies suited tonursing phenomena. Equally important, more nurses must be preparedto interpret and apply these and other research findings inpractice settings. Need for Doctoral PreparationAccording to preliminary findings from the .979 National Surveyof Nurses with Doctorates conducted by ANA and funded through theDivision of Nursing, Health Resources Administration, there are onlyapproximately 2,500 nurses with doctorates in the United States. Thisis far too few to meet the needs of educational and service settings. American Nurses' Association and National League for Nursing PriorityBecause of the critical need and increased demand for nursesprepared to deliver high quality care in the most cost-effectivemanner in today's highly complex health care system both the Americ.-nNurses' Association and the National League for Nursing have identifiedthe continuation of federal monies for the preparation of nurses withadvanced degrees as their highest priority. In order to achieve thispriority however, assistance is necessary at the undergraduate levelto increase the pool of qualified candidates eligible for advancedstudy. 60 55 -8- We are Pleased that S 799 would extend the Nurse Training Act for three years.Lack of consistent oolicy direction during the oast few years has severely affected Program planning in schools of nursing. Continuity will, in addition, enhance and Provide a broader base for evaluation of program effectiveness. Sec.203:Advanced Nurse TrainingNumerous reports reveal a severe shortage of nursing personnelprepared to fill leadership and functional roles such as clinicalnurse specialists, Luz's\u00b0 educators, nurse researchers and administra-tors for service agencies and for education, government and organ-izational work. The definition of advanced nurse training used in past legislationand current regulations is:\"Advanced training programs means a programof study in a collegiate school of nursingleading to a graduate degree in nursing....\" Section 203 of S. 799 could alter this definition considerably.This section proposes that:\"The secretary may make grants to and enter Intocontracts with public and nonprofit private schoolsof nursing and other public and nonprofit privateentities to meet the costs of projects to....\" It is our rnderstanding that with the inclusion of nurse practi-tioner programs ander section the above revisions were necessaryto incorporate iariety of certificate programs currently preparingnurse practitioners. We re_rgnize the unique role that these programshave demonstrated -a the past, but they are no longer sufficient to meetthe current demand for nurse practitioners prepared to funct-z,n Inde-pendently in a variety of settings. 61 56 -9- The American Nurses' Association and National LeagueforNursing both have taken the pos_tion that nurse practitioners must6.7. be prepared in graduate programs in Nursing. Since the inception of the Nurse Training Act in 1964 the demandfor nurses with advanced degrees has continued to be greater than theability of schools to prepare nurses at advanced levels. Any actionthat would decrease this ability in these times of financialconstraint could prove disastrous to nursing's efforts to preparequalified professionals. We urge that Sec. 203 be amended and would suggest the following: The Secretary may make grants to and enter intocontracts with collegiate schools of nursing tomeet the costs of projects to....\" We strongly support the concept that programs in geographic areaslacking such programs and programs on a part-time basis should receivesnecial consideration.It should be noted that there is no documented evidence to supportthe popular assumption that better educationally prepared nurses willincrease health care costs. In fact, managerial effectiveness isincreased with fewer categories of better prepared personnel who canbe held accountable for a broader range of patieht care tasks.Sec. 202. 822, 823 Support for Practicing Nurses; EducationalAssistance to Individuals from Disadvantaged Background1-7TFTngtheningNursing Education. Special projects, authorized in Section 820 of present law havebeen most beneficial in fostering the development of new nursingmethods emphasizing primary care, health education, prevention andgreater cost effectiveness. 62 57 -10- It is our understanding that the intent of sections 202, 822, 823of S. 799 is to provide for a variety of activities which wouldenhance the attractiveness of nursing, improve clinical practice,and provide for such programs as continuing education for nurses inareas where no schools of nursing exist. Past and current specialproject grants authorizations have spoken to this need in languagebroad enough to include schools of nursing and public and nonprofitprivate entities which also Includes hospitals. We do not believe itnecessary therefore, to specify \"public and non-profit hospitals\" andurge that this be amended to delete the reference to hospitals. We donote that special consideration will be given to schools of nursingand understand that such consideration will be expanded upon IL reportlanguage and regulations.We do not believe that funding authorized for Sections 2J2, 622and 823 is sufficient to cover the variety and complexity of programsspecified.We therefore recommend authorization levels be doubled andthe sections be targeted to programs which have proven to be effectivein enhancing innovative clinical and academic learning including con-tinuing education, assistance to individuals with disadvantaged back-grounds, providing flexible opportunities for career mobility forpracticing nurses and programs preparing nurse practitioners Sec. 206:TraineeshipsAlthough enrollments in master's programs rose by nearly 8 per-cent in 1979 over the previous year,, the population of full-timeenrullees dipped below 50 percent. It is predicted that with theincrease in part-time enrollments, slowdowns in growth rates ofgraduations will occur. 63 58 Further, in light of recent inflation and economic concerns andincreased numbers of persons entering nursing as a second career,we believe that traineeships must be maintained. Due to the highdemand for better prepared nurses, we support consideration ofofferingsome assistance to part-time students. An acceleratedpayback system might be tied to this part-time assistance. Section 208-210: Loan AgreementsNursing remains one of the lowe. paid professions in thecountry.Many nursing students come from homes with incomes thatare not high enough to support any post-high school education. Asurvey by the National Student Nurses' Association showed over 50percent of nursing student respondents coming from homes with incomesbelow $15,000 per year. The request for loans,, as well as scholarshipshas remained greater than funds available. The \"SNA survey reportedthat 85 percent of students receiving federal funds said they wouldbe unable to continue their education without that assistance. A totalof 61,33 percent of the students responding to the NSNA survey saidthat they held jobs to help meet education and maintenance costs. We are pleasef that loan provisions remain in proposed leg)slationand that Sec. 208 repeals the prohibition against participatic, in theNDSL program.In a time of shrinking financial resources and fundingit is most helpful for nursing students to be able to participate inNDSL. we continue to support loan forgiveness as both a mechanism torelieve maldistribution and improve access to care as well as avehicle to increase the potential applicant pool for graduate study. 64 59 -12- Section 211-212: ScholarshipsScholarship assistance has in the past, been designed to andhas served as a resource specifically for those students who wouldnot be otherwise able to obtain a nursing education. This groupparticularly includes financially distressed students as well asethnic minorities. If nursing is to continue to fulfill its socialobligations in the delivery of quality health care and increase henumbers ofanorities and disadvantaged in nursing education programsscholarship monies must be retained at this time. We thereforebelieve that scholarships should not be repealed but rather continuedand funded at an adequate level. Section 215:DelegationThe nursing shortage is a nationwide shortage and not merelygeographic in nature. It is unlikely that this shortage will berelieved to any great extent during the next three years. A major concern about the repeal of Section 215 relates to thepotential dilution of a national nursing perspective which includesthe assessment and review of total national needs and the planningfor adequate national resources. Since nursing is a national resource,decentralization, in face of a continuing nationwide shortage wouldonly aggravate the current critical situation. Decentralization of merit review of grants and contracts wouldbe problematic in terms of increased program costs, diffusion ofprogram responsibility and accountability and coordination. Therefore,,we believe that repeal of Section 215 At this time is premature. 83-520 0-81---565 60 -13- Authorization Levels:We appreciate the need to hold the line on federal spending inthese Inflationary times and have indicated our willingness to takeour share of necessary budget cuts. However, given the scope andgoals of this legislation we do not believe the authorization levelsare adequate.We particularly recommend higher authorizations forspecial projects grants. Summary:The nation cannot afford to utilize nurses, its largest groupof health professionals, at anything less than their highest capacity.At the same time, a people who rightfully demand the best healthcare possible must be willing to support the efforts needed toprovide such care. Such support cones through the funds providedfor sound nursing education. POOIN3TES 1.ANA, The Naepn's No.H.R.A.230760279 2.Ibid. 3.NLN Nimrsing Data Book, 1979.

Thank you, Dr. Collins.Dr. Brown?Senator KENNEDY. Madam Chairman, I am going to have toexcuse myself. I want to thank the group that has come here this morning, and particularly the next panel which is on the NationalHealth Service Corps. One of the witnesses will be Mr. GregoryBulger, who is the director of the Community Health Center inMattapan, Mass. I want to thank him very much for coming downhere.We have many fine centers in our State and a very active Stateorganization. This is an excellent program, and I want to thankMr. Bulger for being willing to come down here and talk with usabout these matters. I had a good opportunity to visit a number ofthese centers and see what those National Health Service doctorswere doing. I know that his testimony will be very important andhelpful.I want to give assurances to our other panels that I will lookforward to following their testimony with great interest. Theirsubject matters are matters which I have long been interested inand concerned about and, needless to say, strongly committed to.We will have to do the best we can.I want to thank our panel here, and also thank Gregory forjoining with us, and thank you very much.Senator HAWKINS. Thank you, Senator.Dr. -Brown?Dr. BROWN. I am Billye Brown. I am president-elect of the Ameri-can Association of Colleges of Nursing, and I am dean of the Schoolof Nursing at the University of Texas at Austin.Our association represents over 270 programs in which there arebaccalaureate and graduate programs. Senator, it is very difficultfor me to abstract in a few moments an issue about which i have somuch feeling and feel that I have a great deal of information on. Irealize, however, the constraint of time.I would be prepared to speak to support advanced nurse training,for special projects, and for financial assistance to nursing stu-dents. In the interest of time, however, you have my testimony,which you say will be entered into the record. I think rather thanattempting to abstract, as I said, an issue which I feel is terriblyimportant, perhaps issues that are not included in the writtentestimony could be brought out by questions. And I believe I woulddefer to any questions that might be brought up at this time.Senator HAWKINS. I have questions for both of you.Dr. Collins, I understand from studying that President Carter'srationale for vetoing the nurse training legislation in the 95thCongress was that the outlook was good for adequate, sustainedgrowth in the supply of nurses. I took those words from his text.I hope that projection proves true; however we have not seen itin Florida, even though our population has grown so tremendouslyin the last few years. In Miami alone, there are presently 1,000budgeted positions open for nurses in acute-care hospitals.I need to know from both of you what your projections are for anursing shortage, both of you.Dr. COLLINS. Perhaps I could address that from my perspective inregard to my position as director of nursing and education for a69 64multihospital system that serves hospitals in the three States ofUtah, Idaho, and Wyoming. We presently have affiliate contractsalso with 57 additional hospitals in the broader western region.In Utah alone at the present time, there are over 1,000 budgetedpositions vacant and more predicted to occurbetween now and 1990. Those positions have been established as a result of a studydone in the State of Utah to determine needs for nurses in thepresent and immediate future.In the metropolitan area of Salt Lake City alone, we have 500vacant budgeted positions as of today. I cannot provide figures forall States, but as I react and respond to the constant need forrecruitment, and requests for staff, it is apparent to me that we are not nearly meeting the need or filling the positions.I do know for a fact that in some hospitals, acute beds are closing; beds needed to meet the needs of the sick in some areas are having to be deactivated because of the lack of personnel in thenursing area.Senator HAwKiNs. Dr. Brown, would you support that? Dr. BROWN The same is true in Texas. I failed to mention thatAustin is in Texas, but I thought perhaps you knew that.Senator HAWKINS. I thought it was. We have been here a longtime.Dr. BROWN. The same is true in Texas; we do have a great shortage of nurses there, and many beds are closed in the acutecare hospitals, particularly. There is a great need for nurses innursing homesan area that we have not placed a great deal ofemphasis on, but where there is a tremendous shortage of nursingcare being given because of the lack of prepared nurses at theprofessional level.Many of our schools at the baccalaureate and higher degreelevels are church-supported programs; they are private schools. Atthese schools, the tuition is very high Again, the kind of supportthat would be provided with Federal legislationmoney for specialprojects, advanced nurse training, and financial assistancewouldbe very helpful to allow these schools to remain open. Some ofthem will probably have to close if such funds are not available.This will further complicate the shortage of nurses.Dr. COLLINS. Could I add an additional statement9Senator HAWKINS. Yes.Dr. COLLINS. In the Kearny study conducted in Utah, it was determined that at the present rate of enrollment, the shortagepredicted would occur. If funds are cut and declining enrollment is a fact, those shortages could be magnified tremendously as a resultof lack of funds.Senator HAWKINS. You mentioned a perception held by many that the nursing shortage would be solved if inactive nurses re- turned to work. In Florida, there are over 55,000 resident nurses, about 8,000 of which are not currently working. But out of this8,000, only 800 were seeking work. A large percentage of the unem- ployed registered nurses in Florida are retired and they have no intention of returning to work Is that similar to what you are finding on a national level, or are our percentages out of skew?Dr COLLINS I think that is very representative of the nationallevel. As we look at statistics, very often they are deceptive because7 0 65thy say there are great numbers that hold licenses. But the per-centages of those that are interested in seeking employment or arecapable of employment are very low. So, as we review those num-bers, it is very true.I reviewed a statement out of the analysis and planning projectreport from the Wiche study that said that the proportion of unem-ployed nurses is considerably lower than that for the entire U.S.labor force. So, you see that people that are willing and availableto work in nursing are working. There is not an unemploymentproblem.Senator HAWKINS. What percent of the nurses are women? Doyou have those statistics?Dr. Comms. About 96 percent.Dr. BROWN. At least that.Dr. CALLINs. We have attempted to attract more males into theprofession. I think there is a slight increase in the number of malesthat are entering the nursing profession, but it has not dramatical-ly increased in the last few years.Dr. BROWN. We have 10 to 12 percent in our nursing program.However, because of the lack of male nurses who are alreadygraduates, this would bring our overall percentage down so that inthe neighborhood of 96 percent of all registered nurses are female.[The prepared statement and responses to questions submitted toDr. Brown follow:] 66 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES OF NURSINGTestimony on S. 799 toLabor and Human Resources Committeeof theSenateon Health Manpower Legislation April 8,1981 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES OF NURSING11 Dupont Circle, Suite 430, Washington, D.C. 20036 72 67 I am Dr. Billye Brown, President-Elect of the AACN, andDean, University of Texas. Austin. The AACN is an organizationthat represents over 270 schools with baccalaureate andgraduate programs in nursing We are happy to speak in supportof federal investment in nursing education.I will focus my remarks on three areas. Advanced nursetraining, special projects and financial assistance to students.Even though the federal government has provided somesupport for advanced nurse training through previous legisla-tion. the need is still acute. Only approximately five per-cent of nurses in active practice in the United States havehad educational preparation to prepare for teaching, adminis-tration or clinical specialty positions. Repeated studies ofnursing, all the way back to the Surgeon General's Consultantgroup on nursing in 1963, have pointed out that lack of preparedleadership was nursing's most crucial problem. The recommenda-tion of that study was to triple the number, a 1976 report ofa panel of expert consultants composed of nurses and non-nursesrecommended that by 1982, 17-18 percent of practicing nursesshould have achieved leadership preparation.It should be pointed out that funds for advanced nursetraining in previous legislation have been used wisely, recip-ients of training assistance are employed But nursing isstill \"running to catch up\" because changes in the complexities 73 68 - 2 -of both hospital care and management require more highlyskilled professionals. The lack of nurses with such skillsis continuing to have a direct imr-ct on the nursing shortage.Nurses prepared under advanced nurse training are employedin a wide range of settings as teachers who are indispensablefor the education of the nurse at all levels of preparation,as directors of nursing who manage the largest group of personnel,the nursing service staff in hospitals, as clinicans who provideexpert care and teach and direct the nursing practice in spe-cialty care units in hospitals, as practitioners who renderprimary care in rural areas and in underserved ur5an areas.Curtailment of educational support for nursing's leadershipgroup can only worsen the nursing shortage All nursing organ-izations join with us in urging the Senate not to curtailsupport for advanced nurse training and traineeships.Special ProjectsSpecial project grants, on a competitive basis, can becompared to small investments which enable faculty to developmaterials or methods which will result in improvements inteaching or in nursing care. An example is planning, pilottesting and evaluating outreach programs which bring under-graduate or graduate courses to sites distant from the campusor medical center Some schools have used project giant fundsto develop self-instructional learning packages which havereduced the cost of education. Other schools have developed 74 69 - 3 -a consortium for continuing education, programs to recruitand retain disadvantaged students or educational career laddersfor the practicing nurse.In today's budgets in colleges and universities it isliterally impossible to justify any released time for faculty todevote to ideas which improve and extend the values of educa-tion.Continuation of federal support for competitive specialproject grants is badly needed. One provision for receivingthese grants is the stipulation that the university or schoolwill continue the program when the grant has been completed.I see special project dollars and the support for advancednurse training to be financial stimuli to the private sectorto risk new ventures in education and to improve the educationof nurses.My last remarks are directed to the importance and necessityof loans and scholarships for nursing students.Let me explain why we believe nursing students need speciallydesignated loans and scholarships.987. of nurses are women. They are subjected to thevalues within families which, when money is limited,leads the family to choose to educate its sons..Nursing students come from middle or lower classfamilies.Without help these students cannot affordto enter baccalaureate (4-year) programs in nursing -- 70 - 4 -and yet this is the most direct and most economicalapproach to lessening the nursing shortage. Nursingeducation, which must include clinical practice, isexpensive.This is reflected in tuition..Moreover, the clinical schedule, including time andcost of travel to clinical sites, makes it difficultfor nursing students to work as many hours as theircoed friends in arts and sciences..The starting salary for beginning nurses is low -between $9,500 and $13,000.The repayment rate on loans to nursing students hasbeen good.We appreciate the zeal of your committee in its effortsto reduce federal spending. However, we believe that the reduc-tions in the Nurse Training Act are, to use an apt term, radicalsurgery.The nursing community has no other federal support forits educational programs. The30 million in the billrepresents the total federal contribution to nursing educationWe believe it is important for this Committee to know that 40percent of AACN's member schools are in the private sector,63 percent of the private schools have religious sponsorshipand 37 percent are private-secular. We are very concerned thatwithout some assistance to students and programmatic support moreprivate schools of nursing will be forced to close and stateschools will be less able to respond to the total need. 76 Senator HAWKINS. We thank you ladies for coming and we hopeyou will forgive the lack of attendance because of other meetings that go on simultaneously during the same time. It seems to be arule of the Senate that all committees meet at the same hour andsame moment in time.Senator Hatch has questions he would like submitted to both ofyou, and you can respond in writing for the record, and othermembers of the committee who wish to do so may do so.Dr. COLLINS. Could I make one more statement with regard tocosts?Senator HAWKINS. Yes.Dr. CouaNs. It will be very brief. In identifying costs for educa-tion for nursing, there has been a great deal focused on the diplo-ma level of education. The statistics out of the HEW study, report- ing the direct costs per student of operating basic programs, thediploma program still ranks the highest costwise. The associatedegree at $1,600 and the baccalaureate at $2,500 gives us an indica-tion of how that relates to $3,300 for diploma nursing. I think weneed to address that fact as we look at where the moneys can bestbe used for advanced preparation in nursing education.Senator HAWKINS. Thank you so much.We will now revert to panel II which will discuss S. 801, the National Health Service Corps amendments. First on the panel willbe Dr. Ross Woolley, who is an associate professor and chairman ofthe division of community medicine at the University of UtahCollege of Medicine. He has initiated and contributed to a greatdeal of research related to health care delivery, and specificallyrural health problems.Second will be Dr. Jack Hadley, senior research associate at theUrban Institute in Washington, D.C.

Thank you. Let me just summarize some points.I would like to point out that our experience with the NationalHealth Service Corps began virtually at its inception, or at least 7 7 72when the first deployments were made, and has included a lot ofdifferent kinds of activities that relate to both the deployment ofthe Corps and helping communities to achieve manpower underthe National Health Service Corps program and conducting stud-ies, as well as providing services. We have run five different clinicsin the Intermountain West using National Health Service Corpsmanpower.So, I come to this committee with a dual perspective of bothresearcher and provider.I would like to say at the outset that there have been some verypositive impacts from the National Health Service Corps in theIntermountain West.I would point out that the IntermountainWest is a rather peculiar place in terms of the kinds of problemsthat we face as perhaps opposed to the other parts of the country.We do not refer to our problems as being problems of ruralhealth, but rather remote health. We do not have very many evendistributed, low-density populations. We have some very isolatedpockets of population of low density which are frequently separatedby hundreds of miles with virtually no population in between. Thisreally presents some significant problems when it comes to estab-lishing adequate medical care in these areas.The National Health Service Corps has indeed helped us to fillsome significant needs.Second, there is no question that the financial assistance thathas been provided to medical students and nursing students andothers has been a significant contribution. The ability of studentsto go to school without having to worry about working outside orseeking outside loans, and so forth, has really been important.All of those good things having been said, there have been a fewproblems and I would like to touch on a couple of those problemareas.We have had a good deal of confusion, as I suspect many otherareas of the country have, in terms of just what the focus andpurpose of the National Health Service Corps is. We have hadconfusion about who qualifies and who should qualify for NationalHealth Service Corps placement.We frequently have found that health systems agencies andothers who are supposed to be helping in this activity have usedthe wrong data; they have been confusing and they have failed togive any consideration to advanced planning in terms of what islikely to happen in terms of manpower needs.There has also been confusion as to how to evaluate and how tojudge whether a Corps site has been a good site or a bad site. Whatare the terms of productivity? Is it simply the number of patientsthat one pushes through the door in a given day, or does it relateto an overall increase in the level of care that exists in a communi-ty?There have been some real problems in terms of disincentives,particularly under the scholarship program. We found a lot ofstudents or residents that came out with 1 year's residency andinterrupted their training program to fulfill their obligation. Manytimes, we had people who were totally untrained in primary caregoing cut into rural, remote, isolated places and trying to deliver a78 73full range of services. They had no incentive for staying on andbuilding a large practice.In fact, there was a real disincentive because they were given abonus simply for maintaining the time and place for the durationof their obligation, plus the fact of why build a large practice thatattracts a lot of people who become interested in you as a providerwhen you are going to be leaving anyway? There is a great emo-tional component that goes along with that.Finally, as a disincentiveand this has real impacts as it relatesto the proposal for instituting the private practice optionis thewhole issue of fee structures. We have been instructed, and thereare very clear guidelines, that in establishing fees in clinics, wemust follow what is the current and usual fee structure prevailingin the communities so as to not create unfair competition.Older, established physicians who have been in communities formany, many years and who have their buildings paid for and have inadequate medical record systems that do not cost very much tomaintainthey can charge $4 or $5 for an office visit. Then we asksomebody to come along and establish a solvent, productive prac-tice, and it cannot be done. It is a real disincentive for people toestablish private practice.So, there are some real questions as to how the private practiceoption is really going to attract people into the areas where weneed them and where these kinds of disincentives may exist. Thereare questions as to areas without hospitals.An ambulatory, primary care physician who bases his entirepractice on ambulatory, out-patient, nonhospital medicine is at asignificant economic disadvantage. I have not heard anything ad-dressed as to how that is going to be adjudicated.There are questions about administrative overhead. Our experi-ence has been that National Health Service Corps sites are admin-istratively topheavy because of the rules and regulations of havingto fill out forms and comply with various regulations. Typically,this requires at least one additional administrative person.We need to have better orientation in communities; we need tohave physicians who understand the kinds of communities they aregoing into. I suspect that the private practice option may be benefi-cial in that regard.Let me just make a plea, if I may. The States, and particularlythe States in the Intermountain West, need more flexibility andneed a greater voice in planning their own manpower needs. Therecent census that came out showed that Utah grew 38 percentbetween 1970 and 1980, where the rest of the Nation was obviouslyat a much lower rate of growth. That is the tip of the iceberg; thatis what is going to happen.Exxon just published a report that appeared in the newspaperthe night before last that said that between now and the year 2010,the Intermountain West could expect 800,000 workers to be import-ed for the development of synthetic fuels, if they have their say.That kind of growth is explosive, and we need greater flexibility inbeing able to determine just whe ye need to put manpower and greater flexibility in terms of bei able to do proactive planningand not in response to crisis.7 We need streamlining; we need flexibility in terms of staffing.We need better use of mid-level practitioners.In summary, I think I would just like to say that I see no way that we can meet our manpower needs without some type of Na- tional Health Service Corps program in the future.Senator H.AWKINS. Thank you. Florida grew 41.1 percent in thelast 10 years and can relate to your problem of growth.Dr. WOOLLEY. Yes.[The prepared statement of Dr. Woolley and responses to ques- tions follow:) 75 Page 1 Testimony Presented Before the Senate Committee on Labor and Huma,, ResourcesApril 8, 1981 - F. Ross Woolley, Ph.D. - University of Utah - Salt Lake Ci:y, Utah As a member of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Utah, I have been involved with the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) nearly from its inception. We have participated with communities and governmental agencies in designating health manpower shortage areas,preparing NHSC manpower requests, recruiting nurse practitioners, physiciansassistants and physicians for NHSC placement, and participating in studiesof various aspects of NHSC activity throughout Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.Our research has included studies assessing the impact of NHSCpractices on utilization of medical care services, community acceptance, and practice activities of NHSC assignees. We also completed a study on the adjustment of spouses of NHSC assignees and assessed NHSC productivity and u,ilization in a study of the effectiveness of rural health programsIn addition to research and community development activities withthe NHSC, we have developed five primary care clinics located in the rural Intermountain West wnich have ut4lized corps personnel. The Department of Family and Community Medicine, as the grantee, took responsibility for overall management and provision of services using NHSC manpower. Thus, Ibring today the dual perspective of an academic researcher who has participated inevaluation of the NHSC as well as that of a provider and manager who hasdealt intimately with the day-to-day problems of operating an NHSC-staffed clinic. 83-520 O -81 - -681 76 Page 2 Positive Impact of the NHSC in the Interwountain AreaThere is no question that the availability of health manpower throughthe NHSC has had a very positive impact on helping to meet the health carenreds of people in the rural areas of the Intermountain Hest. Were it notfor guaranteed incomes and direct manpower placement by the rHSC, many smallcommunities would have continued to exist without adequate medical services.Isolated towns, often separated by distances of over a 100 miles from thenearest medical services, simply cannot develop sufficient resources ontheir own.Nor can they combine efforts with neighboring communities dueto excessive distances between these communities. Thus, frequently, theonly viable alternative has been the NHSC. Another area of significant impact has been that of the financialassistance provided to both medical and nursing students.Although the totalpercentage of medical or nursing students receiving NHSC assistance at theUniversity of Utah has never been great, for those using this resource, ithas been a means for going to school without many of the encumbrances oftenplaced on students who must support themselves. Clearly, this financialsupport makes it possible for these students to concentrate on gaining aneducation without diluting their activities through outside employment. Italso limits the need for obtaining other loans which are becoming moredifficult to secure and may put them in serious financial jeopardy formany years. Despite these positive attributes, the processes of obtaining sitedesignation and recruitment and retention of NHSC personnel have createdsome significant nroblems. Although many of these issues are inherent tothe bureaucratic process, I believe that there are positive steps which maybe taken to reduce the difficulties. 82 77 Page 3 Site Designations and NHSC Manpower ApplicationsThe first step in bringing NHSC personnel to an area is obtaining designation of the proposed site as a health Manpower Shortage Area (HMSA) or Medically Underserved Area (MUA). Although the criteria for MUA5 and HMSAs are theoretically distinct, there is considerable confusion between the two on the part of local communities and even the state agenciesresponsible for carrying out the designation process. The result has been that many communities have dissembled when faced with the problem of producing different and contradictory sets of population data, delineating contorted geographic boundaries, revising service area estimates, and reducing aggregated health statistics in order to qualify under one or the other sets of designations. This has effectively eliminated many communities from consideration simply because they did not understand the forms and needs of the government.A major problem encountered in site designation has been the unclear role of the Health Systems Agencies (HSAs) in the review process. In sevcral instances we have found that the HSA uses standards or data which are outdated or applied the wrong set of criteria in making the evaluation. The paucity of accurate health manpower and population data has been a significant problem in working effectively for the designation of hMSA5 or MUAs when developing NHSC sites.Furthermore, there is little, if any, attempt for state or federal agencies to designate areas in anticipation of future needsIndeed, there has been a strong reluctance on the part of the HSAs to approve any proposals for which the need is not already acute. The reason is, of course, that this is mandated by the guidelines from the federal government.HSAs seem to have little incentive in developing guidelines geared specifically to state or regional needs. Unfortunately, the lack of proactive planning has 83 78 Page 4 become a major problem. With the intermountain area growing at a rateunexceeded by any other area in the United States (Utah grew by 38% from1970-1980), the need for anticipatory planning and, hence, site designationis critical.With the construction of power plants or the development ofenergy resources such as coal,-oil, natural gas, oil shale, or tar sandsfor example, we have seen, and expect to see again, 100% or greaterincreases in community populations in the span of a few months. This rapidgrowth is frequently characterized by young, highly transient populationswith heavy demands for acute care services which cannot be met by existinghealth manpower. The introduction of new NHSC providers or any other type of healthmanpower into a community requires a certain period of adjustment.It hasbeen our experience that the longer the community is without health careservices the longer it will take for new providers to become well utilized.This may be due to the fact that once people have established alternativesources of health care, they are reluctant to make a change, even thoughnew services may be relatively more accessible. This does not mean that thenew resources are not needed. It does mean, however, that the developmentof even small systems of health care delivery requires time This will, inthe long run, result in improvements in both the quality and quantity ofhealth care. It is apparent that goals and objectives of the NHSC have shifteddramaticallyIt is still unclear as to whether or not the federal governmentis intent on developing services only where there is economic sufficiency orwhether reasonable geographic accessibility is paramount.Should the govern-ment insure access to care regardless of its economic viability? This isapparently the philosophy which prevails for Native Americans, given themagnitude of services provided by the Indian Health Service. Or, should the 84 Page 5 government simply do nothing to limit access to medical care while main-taining no direct responsibility for providing services where none areavailable.Presently, the federal position on this issue is unclear andthis lack of clarity has produced some considerable chaos in determiningjust who gets NHSC personnel. Historically, the placement of NHSC assignees (especially thoseunder the scholarship program) has been determined by a grading system for sites.There are four levels of sites currently under designation. At thistime, however, only level 1 and level 2 sites qualify for placement underthe loan forgiveness or scholarship obligation programs. Level determinationsare made by evaluating various aspects of the shortage area criteria, e.g.,the provider-to-population ratios. Although the prccess for determiningwhich communities will be at which levels is largely a function of the numberof sites who have made application in relationship to the manpower pool available, the unpredictability of this process makes it difficult to planand advise communities who are seeking assistance. Furthermore, our small,remote sites rarely meet the population density requirements. Economic Factors As indicated above, the issue of the federal position in relationshipto providing access to services is unclear. This becomes a major factor indetermining whether or not a particular NHSC site has an appropriate level of utilization and is, consequently, judged as being productive. Th. issueof productivity has been a significant one in evaluating sites. Unfortunately,the very nature of the system has tended to make the site nonproductive ascompared to their counterparts in the private sector. There are, in fact,some significant disincentives under the existing scholarship program whichmay or may not be ameliorated under the private practice option (PPO). These 80 Page 6 disincentives include the following:, 1.National Health Service Corps assignees traditionallyhave had little or no training in practice management. Unfortunately, the practices they enter are traditionallyon very shaky economic ground. Thus, careful attentionto the details of practice economics and personnelmanagement is required. Although the governing boardis supposed to take an active role in establishing management policies, the nature of the medical caresystem generally puts the provider in the leadposition as it relates to management decisions.Therefore, conflicts between providers and governingboards become commonplace. 2.There is a limited commitment on the part ofscholarship and some other assignees to establishingor building a significant practice. Many NHSC assigneeshave no intention of remaining in primary care practiceor at the site where they were placed. Many scholar-ship recipients left residencies to fulfill their 2 or3 year obligation and had no intention of practicing aprimary care speciality. At the end of their tour ofduty, they left the corps and returned to a residency training program. 3.There are no economic incentives for productivitygiven to scholarship recipients and bonuses have beenpaid not for productivityr but merely for remainingin place to complete their tour of duty. There has neverbeen an attempt under the scholarship program to provide 86 81 Page 7 incentives for increasing utilization of services or other forms of productivity. Salaried systems could,and should, be augmented by some form of incentive basedon practice productivity. Incentives should notnecessarily be tied only to the number of ambulatory patients seen in the office. A significant portion ofmany assignees' time, especially in the smaller communities, should be consumed with preventiveservices, health education and organization of moreeffective service delivery systems. 4.Fee structure imposed on NHSC sites are often un- realistic.By agreement, to avoid unfair competition,NHSC sites are obliged to charge fees which arerepresentative of the prevailing rate structure in the community. Unfortunately, in areas where themajority of existing providers have been in practicefor many years, prevailing rates may well be belowthose necessary to develop and maintain a new and economically viable practice. In many instances, established practices have the advantage of buildingswhich are completely debt free, minimal (and often inadequate) recordkeeping systems which do not requiresignificant expense, medical records systems whichwould not meet BCHS requirements, yet are inexpensiveto operate, and a minimal number of staff whose salarydemands are modest Thus, the new NHSC provider may beattempting to deliver up-to-date care using a fee structure that was adequate two decades ago. 87 82 Page 8 Many of the current problems experienced in NHSC sites may be overcomeby the PPO, however, there are some serious questions raised by the discon-tinuance of the scholarship program. For example, under the most recentoperating guidelines, NHSC sites have often not been expected to achieveeconomic viability. With the discontinuance of the scholarship program anda shift to the PPO, the question arises as to the incentives that will begiven to NHSC providers to practice in areas with marginal economies orgeographic isolation which makes them undesirable. Obviously, under thePPO, the provider is at significantly greater economic risk than thescholarship recipient operating strictly on a salary. At issue is not onlythe amount of subsidy to be provided, but also the duration of such helpunder the private practice option. An attendant issue is the economic impact of practicing in an areawithout hospital services. Under current reimbursement schemes, any primarycare practitioner providing services where there is no hospital is at asignificant economic disadvantage. The amount of income which can begenerated by a practice exclusively devoted to ambulatory care is morelimited than one in which hospital services can be provided. Such asituation threatens the provider not only economically, but also medically.Cerrinly, most physician training programs do not adequately prepare theirgraduates to practice without the substantial benefit and backup providedby a hospital. Regulations imposed by the Bureau of Community Health Services (BCHS),the NHSC itself, and other federal agencies make the development of a viableNHSC practice unnecessarily difficult It has been our experience that atleast one extra staff member is required in an NHSC site as compared to a private practice to prov4de the management services required by federalregulations.Frequently, this one additional person results in increases 88 83 Page 9 of 33% in the staffing level in small clinics. Reporting requirements, auditing procedures, requirements for linkages with other programs, licensure review procedures, etc., all of which are ostensibly designed to improvethe quality of services provided, have, 4n many instances, imposed suchencumbrances upon the practice that the opposite effect was achieved. I am aware of many instances where regulations were functionally ignoredand reports were generated based more on fantasy than fact simply to cut down on the amount of bookkeeping and paperwork.In a similar vein, we have observed that there are competing orconflicting requirements from different federal agencies. Although in the following example the practice was not an NHSC site at the time, it was acommunity health center funded under the auspices of BCHS and, therefore, subject to the same operating rules and regulations as an NHSC site. Weestablished a clinic at Page, Arizona, which primarily served the needs ofthe Navajo Indians living in and withn a 50 mile radius of that isolated community.The Indian Health Service had provided one-day-a-week services for a number of years using a traveling clinic. Unfortunately, there were too many occasions when acute illnesses required immediate attention,necessitating trips of over 80 miles to the Tuba Hospital.In operating this clinic, we received grant support from BCHS, but because the serviceswere being provided by federally funded personnel to Native Americans, theoperating rules and regulations of the Indian Health Service were more consistent 4ith the needs of the patients being served. A major issue, which caused a great deal of concern, was the charging of fees On the one hand, BCHS regulations demanded that we establish a sliding scale fee schedule and attempt to collect fees from the Indian patients. On the other hand, the Indian Health Service (IHS), of course, has never made an attempt to collect fees for their services. Since the IHS hospital and specialists were a major 89 84 Page 10 source of referral and we used an IHS clinic as a satellite site, we wereinexorably connected to the INS and the whole issue of fees and chargingfor services became extraordinarily complex. As a resu1t, many hours ofexpensive administrative time were spent in attempting to resolve this dilemma.It is precisely this type of confusion which requires extraadministrative overhead and dilutes the effectiveness of federally fundedclinics in delivery of services. Retention The issue of retention of NHSC assignees beyond their basiccommitment is a multifaceted problem. Many factors undoubtedly contributeto decisions to leave a site or to buy out of the program. It is apparentfrom our experience that the increased penalty for buying out (three for onepayback) has had a significant effect on the number of obligees who elect tofollow this course. The most significant factor related to retentionappears to be orientation to the community. Adequate orientation takes onseveral dimensions which include being socially oriented, and medicallyoriented to the practice environment. We recently conducted a study of spouses of NHSC assignees. Previousstudies have shown that the single most important factor in physicianlocation is spouse preference. Our research found that the most criticalfactor in helping spouses to adjust to the community was, in fact, helpfrom inside the community rather than assistance provided by NHSC orientation sessions.Interestingly, this study, which was completed late in 1979,found that 72; of the 61 NHSC providers were currently buying homes in thecommunities to which they had been assigned. This suggests that there is areasonable high expectation for permanance among those assigned to Region VIII.However, experience suggests that lack of attention to spouse concerns will 85 Page 11 dilute this commitment.One of the most helpful features of the PPO which we have observed todate has been the significantly greater orientation which takes place prior to the assignees arriving on -Site. Because of the greater involvement inthe details of establishing a practice, the PPO provider frequently makes several visits to the community before actually beginning practice.The appropriateness of the training received by NHSC assignees is also of great importance. As indicated earlier, we have observed that manyNMSC assignees have not had training appropriate for their site. For example,a family practitioner trained in a residency program emphasizing only internalmedicine and pediatrics is poorly suited for entering practice in a Westernrural community where there is a hospital and only one or two other physicians.It is virtually incumbent upon these assignees that they practice obstetrics and surgery.Becuase of low occupancy rates and high overhead, most smallrural hospitals are dependent upon surgery and obstetrics to maintain solvency.Conversely, there may be physicians who must learn to practice where thereare no hospital facilities at all as well as those who are forced to practice specialities for which they have received limited training.The scholarship program cf the NHSC was thought to be having someanpact in modifying resident -raining programs so that assignees would achieve skills more consistent with their anticipated practice. The effects of the eliminati.n of the scholarship program, of course, ate unknown as they relate to possible influence upon curricula.An area which has caused problems for NHSC providers has been theantagonism which they have aroused in both patients and other providers.In one community we observed that the NHSC physicians refused to continuepractices instituted by a physician who had served the community for many years.The procedures in question were undoubtedly antiquated and of 91 86 Page 12 questionable value. Unfortunately, the new physicians were given noguidance nor had they had any relevant training in how to deal with what was a significant community health education problem. Their tactics included lecturing at patients and writing hostile editorials in the local newspaperin an attempt to persuade the community that their style of medicine wasbetter than that of the former physician. It took a number of years beforethe mutual antagonism was dissapated. it is probable that the skepticismwhich many people have for federal programs contributes to the hostility.Even after former NHSC physicians have converted over to straight privatepractice, they are often .111 referred to as the \"government doctors\".Similarly, many private physicians resent the fact that the governmentis helping to estaulish new physicians in their community. Part of this isfear of competition, however, jealousy also plays a role. There olderphysicians recall that there was no one available to help them start their practice when they first came to the community.All of these factors point to the need f6r a greater education andcooperation among the existing medical community and tht NHSC. In all likelihood, in the Intermountain Area the PPO will be much more palatableand understandable by the current physicians in practice than were the salaried assignments. It is important, however, that we continue to solicitthe help and support of the existing medical community and not simply obtain their acquiesence to NHSC placement. Suggestions for the FuturePerhaps the most pressing need in the re-structuring of the NHSC is toprovide the states with greater flexibility in determining their own health manpower needs. In the past, excessively difficult regulations, cumbersomeselection criteria, and bureautic bottlenecks imposed by HSAs and other 92 87 Page 13 agencies have tended to discourage communities where significant needs existed.In the Intermountain Area we are in the midst of a major population boom related to energy development. This boom is expected to continue over the next 30 years and the development of a viable health care system iscritical to preserving the quality of life that now exists. It would behighly desirable to let states develop flexible criteria for designating energy impaced areas as MMSAs. The following is an example of a possible set of criteria for designating an energy-impacted health service area. 1.The proposed service area is rational for the delivery ofprimary care services. 2.Each of the following conditions prevails with the area:. a.The area has, or is projected to have within one year,a primary care practitioner-to-population ratio of 1 to 800. b.The area is at a distance of more than 30 minutes travel time from the nearest contiguous health services. 3.The protected increase of population of the area is aminimum of 100% during the (36 months or more) initial construction phase period. 4.The primary medical care providers in the nearestcontiguous area will be unable to meet the increased demands for the projected population growth in the impacted area.1 1These criteria were developed cooperatively by the Moltana HSA and theUtah Network of Rural Health Systems, Division of Community Hedicine, UnivPrsityof Utah. 93 88 Page 14 Although the development of long-term sites for placement of NHSCassignees is desirable, there are some situations in which the needs formedical services are of limited duration. The Intermountain Area isanticipating large growth followed by diminished populations in many areasin which synthetic fuels or electrical, generating plants will be built. Inthese situations, additional manpower to meet the peak demands will be requiredfor only two to five years. Therefore, some provision for limited termassignments should be incorporated. Professionals associated with the NHSC program should increase theiractivity and collaboration with medical schools and residency training programs.Increased opportunities for training physicians in practice management, healtheconomics, and the behavioral sciences are critical to the success of the NHSC. Additional training in community medicine and health care organization wouldalso be highly desirable inasmuch as many NHSC assignees provide the leader- ship for all medical services in the area in which they practice. Animportant linkage which is often neglected is that with the state and localpublic health personnel. It may be desirable to develop point functions whereNHSC assignees serve both as public health officers and provide routinemedical care. An essential ingredient in the further training of future NHSC assigneesshould be an opportunity, while still in training, to serve a preceptorshipeither in the area in which they plan on establishing practice or in onesimilar to it. Our observation has been that this experience is -invaluablein helping assignees to build relationships with the established providersas well as anticipate and resolve many of the problems which are inevitablein establishing a new practice. The reduced amount of paperwork required of NHSC assignees under thePPO system is gratifying. Streamlining reporting and administrative 94 89 Page 15 requirements in order to reduce practice overhead is vital. Althoughsound business management dictates that accurate records be maintained,the unnecessary paperwork and compliance with inappropriate or low-yieldfederally mandated programs can reduce an otherwise viable practice to insolvency. The NHSC should be lead:ng the way in the development of innovativepractice activities and arrangements. Staffing patterns in NHSC sites,should be such that they maximize the potential utilization of the communityin which they are located. The practice of having two providers on siteto prevent burnout and maintain full-time coverage is desirable. Economicsmay, however, dictate that more reliance be placed on the use of mid-levelpractitioners working either as teams or in combination with physicians. It is important, however, that when physicians are asked to participate inthe delivery of services with mid-level practitioners, they have previousexperience and understanding of the role and capabilities of these providers.An understanding of the distinction between nurse practitioners and physicians assistants is important. Although students and residents may encruntermid-level practitioners in their hospital training many are unfamiliar withhow these personnel function in the rural ambulatory setting. SummaryOn the whole, our experience wite the National Health Service Corps in the Intermountain West has been a positive one. Although projections for a physician surplus by 1990 have convinced many that economic pressures willforce physicians into areas that are currently underserved, the rapid growthin the West will probably demand that assistance from National Health Service Corps providers will be required in the foreseeable future.Greater flexibility at the state level in determining the need forhealth manpower is an important factor for the future success of the NHSC.It is vital, however, that consistent policy regarding the govern-ment's commitment to providing access to ,edical care be developed. 90 RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS 1.In any federally funded program there meat, of course. be baselinestandards, as well as flexibility that make sense based on the needs in different parts of the country. A sensit.7e designation of medicallyunderserved areas in Utah could be mote efficiently and accuiately addressed at the state level. Representa_ives from academe, the state, and regional and local officials must sit down together to equitably define a working formula from which the needs of medically underserved ::real could be met. 2.The scholarship program was instituted at the same time as almost every otaer avenue of federal and public support .as withdrawn. Therefore, a variety of students with different agendas turned for assistance to the NHSC scholarship program. Thus, although there are undo4btedlystudents sz-king financial assistance thrJugh .his program and who, fora variety of reasons, are not suited for either primary care or serviceto the underserved, the Corps scholarship program continued to be acritical source of support for appropriate students. AA April 1981 DENS study found that over 14% of the medical scholarship recipientsfor the 1979-80 school year were identified as non-white. These students will, by definition, serve the underserved at a higher rate than their white counterparts. We cannot ignore the honest financial needs ofthese and low-in,ome white students who often come from and will return to rural areas. We must diversify moans o' inancial support so that we can adequately respond to those who will s, in the public interest. 96 91 3.The Intermountain West will bear the burden of developing energy resourcesnecessary to the whole country. The federal government has a responsibilityto assist this area in the provision of the myriad of public serviceswhich will be necessary to support these energy development projects.The upfront cost of water, sewer, roads, schools, and other basic servicescannot be borne by current populations. Further, it will be necessaryto plan for services to mitigate social impacts of communities undergoingrapid change.We know from the experiences in places like Gillette andGreen River, Wyoming, that rates of alcohol and drug abuse, as well asof family violence, will increase dramatically. Such social problemscan be linked to the efficiency of the business operations in the area.There are clear economic costs to disregarding these basic human servicesThe federal government must join with private companies in paying for thecost of developing viable health and mental health services in these areas.To leave such responsibility solely in the hands of the privatesector would be to disregard a basic public responsibility. 4.The experience of the past ten years makes it clear that merely increasingthe number of primary care residency graduates will not correct problemsof geographic maldistribution. Even with a greater percentage of studentschoosing to practice in rural areas, shortages will continue to exist insmall, isolated communities Corps physicians and/or mid-level practitionerswill be needed in substantial numbers during the 1980's in our area, particularly ..ith the transient pattern of energy projects in isolatedareas of the rural Intermountain West. The market mechanism alone will not meet these needs. 83-520 0-81--79 .? 92 5.Promoting appropriate matches of health professional to rural areas must involve two basic changes. a.Selection procedures to medical school must take into account thosefactors which have been shown to be predictive of practice in rural communities.Both Florida State and Michigan State have successfully implemented admissions formulas oriented toward this goal. I recommend that we study these two examples carefully. b.The training of health professionals must include early and repeated opportunities for exposure to rural practice. The health professionalin training should be allowed to develop an ongoing relationship in a specific community to which he or she might consider returning.We must not make the mistake of thinking that everyone could be convincedof the attractiveness of rural practice. Rather, we must target ourefforts towards those most likely to find work satisfaction In the rural setting Two other factors must be remembered. 1.It is counter-productive to alter . selection procedure without altering the corresponding training program. 2.Since spouse satisfaction has been shown to be the single most imoortant factor in the size of a town in which a physician settles, the familyunit must be treated as a whole in the campaign to make rural practice more attractive. PW/kn 95 93Senator HAwxiNs. Dr. Hadley?Dr. HADt. Thank you, Madam Chairman.My comments focus on two issues. One is trends in the marketfor physicians, the possible effects of market forces on physiciandistribution, and implications for the National Health ServiceCorps. The other is the process of designating health manpowershortage areas.Like most economists, I tend to look forward by looking back-ward. In 1963, there were just over 225,000 non-Federal patientcare physicians in the United States. By 1970, the total numberhad increased by 12.1 percent. However, disparities among geo-graphic areas in the number of people per physician either grewwider or did not change. In sum, the experience of the 1960's wasthat growth in the total number of physicians did not improvetheir geographic distribution.Since 1970, the growth in the total number of physicians hasaccelerated rapidly, reaching almost 323,000 by 1978a more than25-percent increase. By 1990, it is projected that there will be almost 600,000 active physicians and osteopaths, or roughly onephysician for every 409 people. Consequently, the experiences ofthe 1970's may provide some clues as to what might happen tophysicians' earnings and distribution patterns during the 1980's.My reason for focusing first on changes in physicians' earnings isthat this is presumably the mechanism through which marketforces operate. Two trends stand out. First, after adjusting forinflation, physicians' real incomes fell by about 10 percent between1970 and 1978. However, the rate of change differed among variousspecialties and community-size groups.Second, after adjusting for differences in the cost of living, in1971 physicians in nonmetropolitan counties had incomes whichwere about 18 percent larger than the incomes of physicians in thelargest metropolitan counties. In 1978, this relationship was essen-tially unchanged, in spite of about a 25-percent increase in thetotal number of physicians. A further examination of these datasuggests that a good share of the reduction in earnings has beendue to physicians working fewer hours; that is, about 7 percentless, which means that about a quarter of the growth in the totalnumber of physicians was offset by fewer hours of work.What have been the trends in the distribution of physicians overthis period? First, communities in every county size grouping havegained physicians relative to population. Second, the largest rela-tive gains have been made by the smaller metropolitan communi-ties. Third, the smallest increases occurred in the smallest coun-ties, particularly those with fewer than 25,000 people, and in thevery largest, most populous counties.Thus, there has been a diffusion of physicians from the largest tosmaller sized counties, although this diffusion does not appear tohave been as rapid in the smallest counties. Furthermore, therewere no dramatic changes in the relative incomes of physicians indifferent sized communities. Thus, the market does not appear tohave tilted financial incentives sufficiently to offer a very strongstimulus for geographic redistribution.I'd like to turn now to the question of designating health man-power shortage areas. As I am sure you know, the cornerstone of9J 94the process is the population per primary care physician ratio. Asof 1979, there were about 1,400 sites designated as having a physi-cian shortage, and it was estimated that as many as 40 millionpeople came under the health manpower shortage area umbrella.How good is the population per primary care physician ratio asan indicator of where to locate additional medical care resources?The answer I offer is \"not very.\" Probably the biggest reason forthis is that the ratio conveys no direct information about either theuse of medical care or the need for medical care.Second, the focus on primary care physicians ignores the contri-bution of other medical care providers, medical specialists, osteo-paths, nurse practitioners, physicians' assistants, nurses, pharma-cists, and hospitals for improving the health of the Nation.Let me skip ahead a little bit and conclude simply by saying thatthe problem of developing better criteria for designating shortageareas and identifying needy populations is, I believe, soluble. Thereis work underway to try and reach those goals.The problem of placing and maintaining Corps physicians re-quires a more careful and fundamental reappraisal of the Corps'goals and objectives. To the extent that the Corps continues toplace physicians in sites which are relatively the best off among alldesignated sites, then Corps placements simply supplant a processwhich would occur under natural market forces. Continuinggrowth in physician supply will drive more and more physiciansinto successively less well served communities. However, these verymarket forces also insure that the order in which these communi-ties are queued will reflect the financial ability of a community tosupport a physician and not necessarily its residents' needs foradditional medical services.Future interactions between the size of the Corps, designation ofshortage areas, and trends in market-motivated physician distribu-tion depend on which of two alternative strategies is used to placeCorps physicians. The \"bottom up\" approach focuses on communi-ties and populations least able to attract physicians and obtainmedical care on their own. The \"top down\" approach concentrateson communities which appear to have a reasonably good chance ofsupporting a physician financially, but for one reason or anotherhave been unable to link up with a private practitioner.These two approaches to placing Corps physicians reflect, I be-lieve, two fundamentally different objectives which the Corpsmight pursue. The objective of providing a temporary helping handto physicians seeking to establish private practices in currently lesswell served communities implies, and in fact should require, afocus on the best of the worstprecisely those communities withthe best potential for supporting a private practice physician.The goal of providing medical care to those least able to obtain iton their own, for whatever reason, calls for exactly the oppositeapproach to Corps placements. This goal also suggests that theCorps is likely to be a continuing and ongoing factor in suchcommunities At the same time, however, concentrating only onthe worst-off communities narrows the breadth of the shortagearea umbrella. Studies supported by the Robert Wood JohnsonFoundation suggest that 12 to 15 million people are structurallyunderserved This number is considerably smaller than the ap-i 09 95proximately 40 million people claimed to reside in currently desig-nated shortage areas.Finally, one clear consequence of the growing supply of physi-cians is that it is going to become less costly to hire physicians forall activities, including service in the National Health ServiceCorps. Given that medical schools' tuitions, and consequently Corpsscholarship costs, are rising, it may be more efficient to sever theCorps from the process of financing medical education. If this weredone, however, an adequate, though unsubsidized loan program formedical students should be established to fill the vacuum left byending Corps scholarships.Severing the Cops from medical education financing has severaladvantages. Planning flexibility for Corps size and placementshould be greatly enhanced by not being locked into a 6- to 8-year-long pipeline. At the same time, the recruitment pool would begreatly enlarged, permitting greater selection among skills andexperience. Finally, the Corps would be more likely to recruitphysicians with a serious commitment to serving the medicallyneedy rather than young medical students trying to finance anexpensive medical education.In sum, I believe that there is now and will continue to be a needfor a program like the National Health Service Corps. However, Ialso believe that as currently structured, the Corps is not operatingas well as it might. Changes need to be made in the designation,recruitment, and assignment processes.Thank you, Madam Chairman.[The prepared statement of Hadley follows:) 96 Statement ofJack Hadley, Ph.D.Senior Research AssociateThe Urban Institute Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to appear before you thismorning.My name is Jack Hadley. I am an economist with the Health PolicyProgram of The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization locatedhere in Washington. A major portion of my research over the last several years has dealtwith the problems of the geographic distribution of physicians. I haveinvestigated both the factors which influence physicians' location choicesand the normative issue of how physicians should be distributed. I wouldlike to use my time this morning to describe the implications of my research,and other research on these questions, for two issues pertinent to theNational Health Service Corps. The first issue concerns trends in the marketfor physicians, the possible effects of market forces on physician distribution,and consequences for the size of the National Health Service Corps. The secondis the process of designating health manpower shortage areas. I would like toconclude with some general comments about the role of the Corps in meeting thehealth needs of the nation. 102 97 2 Market Forces and the Distribution of PhysiciansLike most social scientists, I tend to look forward(::looking backward/.Accordingly, I'd like to begin by reporting some data from the 1960s. In 1963,there w:re4u6t over 225,000 nonfederal, patient care physicians in the United States.)A 79.1 percent wore located in metropolitan counties and 20.9 percentin nonmetropolitan counties. This translated into 693 people per physician inmetropolitan counties and almost twice that, 1,355 people per physician innonmetropolitan counties.By 1970, the total number of physicians had increased by 12.1 percent, toalmost 253,000. However, the share of physicians in nonmetropolitan countiesdropped to 18.2 percent of the total, and the number of people per physicianin these locations increased to almost 1,400.Also in 1970, the counties with fever than 25,000 residents had fromthree to four times as many people per physician as did metropolitan counties.The state with the greatest number of physicians, Nev York, had only 429people per physician while Mississippi, at the other end of the spectrum, hadalmost exactly three times as many people per physician, 1,266. Finally, aseries of studies of trends in physician distribution within several largecities, Nev York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore documented that therewere very few office-based physicians available to many residents of poorneighborhoods.1 In !UM, the experience of the 19602 vas that growth in the total number of physicians did not improve their geographic distribution. The National HealthService Corps vas established in 1970 partially in response to perceptions of the 19602 experience. It vas felt that some type of direct intervention vasneeded to assist and encourage physicians to locate in communities which haddifficulty in attracting a physician on their own. 103 98 3 Since 1970, the growth in the total number of physicians has acceleratedrapidly, reaching almost 323,00 by 1978--a more than 25 percent increase.The number of people per physician dropped 20 percent, from 728 to 578. By 1990, it is projected that there will be almost 6U0,000 active physicians andosteopaths, or 1 physician for every 409 people. 2Although these projections may be somewhat astonishing, they reflect a rate of growth which is slightly less tlan what occurred between 1970 and 1978. Consequently, the experiencesof the seventies may provide some clues as to what might happen to physicians'earnings and distribution patterns during the 1980s.My reason forocusing on changes in physicians' earnings first is thatthis is presumably one of the mechanisms through which market forces operate.Eight econometric studies of physicians' location choices, which I havereviewed in a paper accompanying my statement, corroborate this presumption.All eight studies found that holding other factors constant, physicians tendto locatc where physicians' incomes are higher. (Estimates varied from a 0.5 to a 4 percent increase in the number of ihysicians for a 10 percent increase in physicians' incomes.)Data on changes in physicians' average net incomes by specialty and community size are reported in Table 1. Some interesting and perhaps surprising relationships appear. First, the data suggest that physicians' incomes are not immune or insulated from market forces. The combination of high inflation rates and an expanding supply of physicians relative to population has -educedphysicians' real incomes (adjusted for inflation) by about 10 percent between 1970 and 1978. This trend has been similar across all three community sizes.General practitioners, obstetrician-gynecologists, and pediatricians seem to 1 99 4 have fared worse than average, while internists, surgeons, and anesthesiologistshave done slightly better than average. Second after adjusting for differences in the cost of living, in 1971 physicians in nonmetropolitan counties hadincomes which were 17.7 percent larger than the incomes of physicians in the largest metropolitan counties. In 1,18, this relationship was essentiallyunchanged nonmetropolitan physicians' earnings were 18.0 percent higher than physician's earnings in the largest metropolitan counties.A further examination of these data suggests that most of the reduction in earnings has been due to physicians' working fewer hours. The change inaverage net real income per hour for all physicians decreased by less than2 percent in nonmetropolitan and large metropolitan counties. The hourl, wage decreased by about 7 percent in small metropolitan counties. (These estimates reflect a reduction in annual hours worked of between 7 and 10 percent.)What have been the treads in the distribution of physicians over this period?First, communities in every county size grouping have gained physicians relative to population. (See Table 3.) Second, the largest relative gains have been made by smaller metropolitan counties. (This in part explains whyphysicians in these locations had the largest decreases in real net income per hour.)Third, the smallest increases occurred in the smallest counties,particularlyerthose with fewer than 25,000 people, and in the very largest, most populous counties. 105 100 5Table 1 Physicians' Average Net Incomesby Specialty and Community Size1971 and 1978 - Constant 1971 Dollars,Adjusted for Cost of Living Differences(Percent from the Profile of Medical Pratice, 1973 and 1980 editions.

Under tho current law, an area which has more than 3,500 people per primary-care-physician and is not adjacentto or accessible to an area which has an excess capacity of primary care physicians is eligible for designation. In addition, population groups and facilities within an otherwise adequately served area may also be eligible for designation.The Secretary is also empowered to take factors such as highinfant mortality, poverty, and the age distribution of the population into account in designating shorage areas. As of 1979, there were just over 1,400 designated sites, roughly 1,100 in rural areas and 300 in urban areas; about L./65 percent of all sites were At least partially staffed.3It is estimated Athat as many as 40 million people may come under the health manpower shortage area umbrella.Given these data as background, how good is the population-per-primary- care-physician ratio as an 'tndicator of where to locate additional medical care resources? The answer I offer is \"Not very.\"On conce2tual grounds, the population-per-primary-care-physician ratio is subject to the following criticisms. First, and perhaps most significant119this ratio conveys no direct information about either the use of medical care or the need for medical care. Second, the focus on primary care physicians ignores the contributions of other medical care providersmedical specialists,osteopaths, nurse practitioners, physicians' assistants, nurses, pharmacists,and hospitals--to maintaining and improving the health of the nation. Third, this ratio provides little basis for comparing areas ane conveys little 1O) 104 9 information about the type of program response which is appropriate. Forexample, it does not follow that an area which has twice as many people perprimary care physician as another is either twice as needy or should receivetwice as many additional physicians or other resources. Lastly, the choiceof a cut-off point for designating shortage areas is arbitrary and is notrelated to the objectives of the program. In effect, the population-per-physician ratio is currently a criterion without a goal.The current criterion is also subject to criticism on a number of mechanicalgrounds.Many of the key concepts that are described in the regulations andare used to construct the criterion are vaguely defined and difficult to measure.Even the most imaginative and resourceful of us would be hard pressed to defineand measure concepts such as rational service area, overused personnel, conti- guous area, excessive distance, inaccessibility, and unusually high need.Consequently, and not surprisingly, the process tends to focus on things thatwe can count and can observenumbers of physicians and politicrl boundaries.The result is,I believe, a poor accounting of differences in physicians' workpatterns--the amount of time spent with patients and the mix of servicesprovidedand patients' travel patterns. I also believe tnat the currentcriteria contain an inherent bias which makes it more likely that rural areasrather than urban areas will be designated, simply because it is much moredifficult to identify meaningful b,undaries and to count physicians in urbanareas. By definition, health manpower shcrcage areas have fever physicians percapita than nonshortage areas. How do residents of these areas compare toresidents of nonshorta3e areas' The statistical evidence is slight, but itappears that, on average, residents of shortage areas may use slightly fewerservices but do not have significantly different mortality rates. 4Theseresults suggest that ch.: current criteria are either not very good at 110 105 10 discriminating among areas or that the designation is too broad. There isalso evidence that cmong designated sites, those with the fewest people perprimary care physician have the best chances of both successfully staffing asite and retaining a Corps members Overall, then, it appears that a combinationof inadequate criteria for designating shortage areas and placement incentiveswithin the Corps have hampered the Corps' ability to provide additional medicalservices to those persons most unable to obtain medical care on their own. The problem of develop...ng better criteria for designating shortage areasand needy populations is, I believe, soluble. My own current research isexploring the feasibility of employing a different type of ratio--the ratio ofMedicare expenditures per enrollee in an area to the mortality rate. Medicareexpenditures per enrollee is a direct indicator of variations in the use of services.The mortality rate is one of the simplest and most direct indicatorsof health status and the potential need for medical care. Both Medicare expen-diture and mortality data are readily available on an annual basis for small areas.they are both defined by Area of residence, so travel patterns to obtain care and boundaries of medical service areas are not a problem. Finally, bothvariables could be available for relatively fine breakdowns of the population into age, sex, and race groups. Thus, I believe that some improvements overcurrent criteria for designating shortage areas could be made fairly readily.The second problem, i.e., olacing and maintaining Corps physicians,requires a more careful and fundamental reappraisal of the Corps' goals and objectives.I will say more about this in my concluding remarks. 111 106 11 Concluding CommentsSo far, I have cried to focus my comments on two separate issues related to National Health Service Corps legislation: market-generated trends in the distribution of physicians and the designation of health manpower shortage areas.I would like to conclude by trying to tie these strands together inororder to draw inferences for the size and structune of the NHSC.To the extent that the Corps continues to place physicians in sites whichare relatively the best off among all desingated sites, then Corps placementssimply supplant a process which would occur under natural market forces.Continuing growth in physician supply will drive more and more physicians into successively less-well served communities. These very market forces alsoinsure, however, that the order in which these communities are queued willreflect the financial ability of a community to support a physician, and not Anecessarily its residents' need for additional medical services.Recent testimony before this Committee by the Department of Health andHuman Services stated that Corps placements in 1980 emphasized the least well served among all designated sites. 6To the extent that this fiend continues,then Corps placements will be less likely to compete with physicians seekingto establish private practices.In effect, interactions between the size of the Corps, designation ofshortage areas, and trends in market-motivated physician distribution dependon which of two alternatism strategies is used to place Corps physicians.The \"bottom up\" approach focuses on communities and populations least able to attract physilkians and obtain medical care on their own. The \"cop down\"approach concentrates on coe=untties which appear to have a reasonably goodchance of supporting a physician financially, but for one reason or another have 'i unable to link up with a private practitioner. 112 107 12 These two different approaches to placing Corps physicians reflect, Ibelieve, two fundamentally different objectives which the Corps might pursue. The objective of providing a temporary helping hand to physicians seeking to establish private practices in currently less well served communities implies,and in fact should require, a focus on the best of the worst precisely chose communities with the best potential for supporting a private-practice physician.The goal of providing medical care to those least able to obtain it on their own, for whatever reason, calls for exactly the opposite approach to Corps placements. This goal also suggests that the Corps is likely to be a continuing and ongoing factor in such communities. At the same time, however, concentrating only on the worst off communities narrows the breadth of the shortage area umbrella. Studies supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation suggest that 12 to 15 million people are \"structurally underserved.\"1 This number is considerably smaller than the approximately 40 million people claimed to reside in currently designated shortage areas.It also seems that the Corps could efficiently meet the goal of serving the structurally underserved with fewer physicians than the 9,000 suggested not too long ago. Although based on very crude calculations, my estimate isthat about 3,000 Corps physicians would be a reasonable interim size for the program.To be more precise than this requires better information and methodsto identify populations which need more medical care and to assess the impact of the Corps on the use of medical services. Both of these should be given high priority for continuing research and evaluation efforts.Finally, one clear consequence of the growing supply of physicians is that it is going to become less costly to hire physicians for all activities, including service in the Hational Health Service Corps. Given that medical schools' tuitions, and consequently Corps scholarship costs, are rising, t 81-520 0--81---8113 108 13 may be more efficient to sever the Corps from the process of financing medicaleducation.(An adequate, though unsubsidized loan program would have to beestablished to fill the vacuum left by ending Corps scholarships.) Thisapproach has several additional advantages. Planning flexibility for Corpssize and placement should also be greatly enhanced by not being locked intoa six-to-eight year long pipeline. At tne same time, the recruitment pool10..4 would be greatly enlarged1permitting greater selection among skills andexperience.Finally, the Corps would be more likely to recruit physicians witha serious commitment to serving the medically needy rather than young medicalstudents trying to finance an expensive education. In sum, I believe that there is now and will continue to be a need for aprogram like the National Health Service Corps. However, I also believe thatas currently structured the Corps is not operating as well as it might.Changesneed to be made in the designation, recruitment, and assignment processes. Ihope that the information I provided the Committee will assist you in yourdeliberations. I have brought with me. Mr. Chairman, copies of several papers which Iwould like to submit for the record and for distribution to the Committeemembers and staff.

Thankyou, Doctor.I have to leave andgo to another meeting at this point, but we are going to continue the hearings. Steve Grossman of Senator Hatch's staff will preside.Mr. GROSSMAN. Mr. Bulger, would you please continue? Mr. BULGER. Thank you, Mr. Grossman.I am here today tourge the committee not to adopt proposalsthat would significantly alter the growth and development of the National Health Service Corps by capping Corps personnel at 2,500 for the foreseeable future, restricting eligibility requirements for placement even further, andencouraging an independent practicemodel. It is vital that the Corps continue to be able to respond to the growing need for primary health care services in shortage areas in both urban and rural communities.Much has been said about the excess supply of physicians that will be evident over the next 5 years. However, in Boston and otherurban areas, it hasnever been a question of physician supply, butof maldistribution.Boston, with its three major medical schools and numerous teaching hospitals, isone of the world's leading medical centers,and if you took the cityas a whole, it probably would have thelowest physician to population ratio of any major American city. Yet, over half of Boston's neighborhoods have been declared health manpower shortage areas and medically underserved areas, and a large segment of the city surrounded by these hospitals has been labeled a \"death zone\" by the New England Journal of Medicine because of morbidity and mortality rates many times above the national average.The private sector has left the inner city neighborhoods in scores over the past 10 to 15 years, and continues to do so. The few that remain will invariablysoon retire. In the Mattapan neighborhoodwhere my center is located, 15 years ago it was predominately a white, middle-class community with ample physicians. It isnow almost entirely a young, black low- to middle-class community with only two part-time generalpractitioners, both over 65, besides thehealth center, providing services to a population which has in- creased to almost 30,000. Thestory is the same for many other Boston neighborhoods as wellas other urban areas across the country.In response to this void created by the absence of the private sector in providing primary health care services, programs such as the National Health Service Corps have become an invaluable source of physicians to serve needy urban populations. Boston now has 28 community health centers which serve over half the city's population. Most of the centers are not supported by Federal funds,but a majority do receive National Health Service Corps place- ments which provide thema vital source of support. And a major-ity of these sites are experiencing significant increases in utiliza- tion rather than a decline.My own center experienceda 40-percent increase in utilization in 1980. In terms of theexcess supply of physicians opening offices inmany of the city's neighborhoods once thought undesirable, this has just not been thecase. The health centers with National116 Health Service Corps support have become in many instances theonly source of primary health care services.Given the economic makeup of the inner-city populations thatare underserved, it is almost impossible for a private physician tocreate a viable practice with a client mix of medicaid and workingpoor who can afford little or nothing toward their bills. Thus, while Boston for many years has had a citywide physicianexcess, these physicians have not chosen to serve the primaryhealth care needs of much of Boston's population. They have in-stead clustered in teaching hospitals and, as documented by theABT study, have served the needs of residents of the surroundingmetropolitan area more than those of the inner city.It is our perception that the number of truly needy residents ofthe city who have no access to primary health care continues togrow, and without the Corps being able to respond to the situation,many people will be left with no medical care.It is important as well, in the designation process for placement,to consider not just geographical barriers, but cultural, language,and racial barriers. For example, the South Cove CommunityHealth Center in Boston sits across the street from a major medi-cal center. Yet, it is the chief source of primary health care forBoston's Chinese population, since it responds to their uniqueneeds in terms of interpreters, et cetera. Such a center might welllose their MUA designation if rigid guidelines were imposed. Yet,no other provider would be able to serve this population. It is vitalthat the uniqueness of various population groups be included in themethodology utilized for Corps placement.In Boston, the great majority of Corps placements have been atcommunity-based, integrated sites, and have allowed the centers toexpand their services to continue to meet the need for basic pri-mary health care services, which continues to grow with the de-cline in the number of physicians practicing in communities servedby the health centers. This type of setting, we feel, has encourag'dphysicians to remain in the community at the centers. However,without continued NHSC support after the initial commitment,most centers cannot hire the Corps physician, given the lack ofother grant support to augment their salary. With a set number ofCorps personnel, many of these physicians would not be funded bythe Corps after the initial placement period.In Boston, volunteer Corps placements have been quite commonand have proved very successful for those involved. But with thecap, volunteers who may be more committed and motivated towork at a particular site would be almost eliminated. While thereare some areas of the country that would not induce volunteers topractice in that locale and would warrant a scholarship placement,a mix of both volunteers and scholarship Corps members should bemaintained.The Corps is a relatively young program and, up to this point,has demonstrated a real capacity to begin to address not just thephysician shortage problem, but the real question of distribution.The private practitioner has shown an unwillingness to serve alarge segment of the inner city and rural populations. As proven inBoston's case, an increased supply of doctors has not effectuatedany real change ii the situation.117 112With the proposed limitation on Corps expansion, many trulyneedy individuals will be denied access to basic primary healthcare services. I would urge the committee not to support the pro-posed leveling off of the Corps and its reorganization, but to sup-port the continued planned growth of the Corps in its present formwith emphasis on placement in integrated, community-based siteswhere the physician can best be utilized.I appreciate this time you have allowed me to express my views.Thank you.[The prepared statement and questions with addendum to Mr.Bulger li 5 113 4101 HILL wvitmotMASS 031311Tv....oftt 194 0041TESTaMONYNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPSSENATE LABOR & HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE Mr. Chairman and Senators, my name is Gregory Bulger.

IS YOUR CLINIC COMPETING WITH THE PLACEMENT OF A PRIVATE PRACTICE PHYSICIAN AND/OR CLINIC? 124 ADDENDUMMANPOWER HEARINGAnswers to additional questionsnot asked at Hearing 1.The nearest hospital is Carney Hospital in Dorchester, which doeshave an outpatient department. The hospital is four miles east Of theHealth Center. However, the hospital's outpatient department ispresently fully utilized and it was in an effort to relieve demand forservices that the hospital encouraged the development of its affiliatedhealth centers such as Mattapan. Given that the Mattapan neighborhoodwhich the Health Center serves is south of the downtown Boston area, themajor public transportation routes run north/south. Thus the trip toCarney Hospital involves at least two and in soma cares three differentbus connections on routes that run quite irregularly. Depending onthese schedules the trip takes one to two hours. Carney Hospital doesaccept Medicare and Medicaid patients. 2.Urban areas such as Mattapan I feel will continue to remain un-attractive to most private physicians primarily because of the economicmix of the population in need of services and without the Health Centerand the National Health Service Corps' Programs, Primary Health CareServices would not be available. Even though the supply of doctorshas increased, the great majority in the Boston area have opted to pract-ice in a particular specialty and are not providing Primary Health Care.To further dissuade the few physics ms interested in Pri,ary Care theeconomic makeup of neighborhoods such as Mattapan does not allow themto set up a viable practice. Mattapan's population which is predominate-ly lower and lower-middle class just cannot provide enough revenue fora private office. Over 557 of the population is considered to be theworking poor who are not eligible for medicaid and who have no insurancecoverage.Most of the uninsured population can afford to pay only asmall percentage of the cost of Primary Health Caro Services. Giventhe situation, any private practitioner would have a difficult timegenerating a decent income to support himself. 3.The Health Planning Council of Greater Boston, Health SystemsAgency IV in Massachusetts just reviewed our Medically Underserved Areastatus in March, 1981 and requested that the Health Center's Health Man-power Shortage Area status be upgraded from a 3 to number one classifica-tion by the Department of Health and Human Services. Upon reviewingthat request the Department. in April formally changed our designationfrom Health Manpower Shortage Area Three to Health Manpower ShortageArea One. 120Mr. GROSSMAN. Thank you.What I am going to do is ask each one of you one of SenatorHatch's, questions and then I assume we will submit further ques-tions to each of you for your answers in the record, and I alsoassume that other Senators will also have questions for you toanswer for the record.I will start off with Dr. Woolley. What recommendations wouldyou make to enhance the attractiveness of the rural practice tohealth professionals?Dr. WOOLLEY. That is a very large question, obviously.Mr. GROSSMAN. I understand.Dr. WOOLLEY. The major problem that I see is one of adequatetraining and preparation. We have a major problem that rural isnot necessarily the same in all parts of even our State or any otherarea of the country. Therefore, we need to train physicians differ-ently to practice in different areas.For example, if you have a person training in a fairly typicaleastern family practice programand I am not discouraging east-ern family practice programs, but they do not typically emphasizeobstetrics or surgery. If such a physician goes to practice in a smallwestern town where they are one of two physicians and you have asmall hospital that operates at 35 or 36 percent occupancy, theonly way to keep the doors open in that hospital is to do obstetricsand surgery. That physician is forced to practice a private medicinefor which he has no training. So, training becomes a critical issue.Second is financial; the Federal Government has a long historyof making nonurban practice financially unattractive. They reim-burse on medicare and medicaid payments at a lower rate, with theperverse notion that it is cheaper to practice in rural areas than itis in urban areas. I know of no valid data to support that conclu-sion.Physicians in rural areas have specific and unusual problems asrelates to continuing education, training, and so forth. The burn-out issue is very real. I do not think that the same standards ofphysician-to-population ratios that are used in urban areas are atall appropriate to rural areas. You simply have to have enoughpeople there to make life worth living.Mr. GROSSMAN. Thank you.[Responses to additional questions to Dr. Hadley follow:] 126 121 RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS Ql.I AM IMPRESSED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY AND 7EEL YOUR RESEARCH IS SUPPORTIVEOF THE COALS OF MY BILL, 5.801. ARE THERE ANY SIGNFICANT CHANCES THATYOU WOULD PROPOSE IN RELATION TO S.80I? A.I sur;ort the goal of separating the NHSC from medical education financing.If this is done, however, I believe that it is essential that an adequatelyfunded, unsubsidised loan program be es:shlished to help fianance medicaltraining. The process of designating /hostage areas should focus primarily onidentifying populations with both poor health and low use of medical care.The ratio of available physicians to population within a geographic areashould be deemphasized as an indicator. Greater emphasis should be given to developing the data systems neededboth to designate populations as eligible for the receipt of Corps personneland to monitor the impact of the Corps on the use of services. Q2.IN REVISING THE DESIGNATION AND NHSC PLACEMENT PROCESS FOR UNDERSERVEDAREAS, HOW CAN WE TAKE ACCOUNT OF AN AREA'S DEMAND FOR SERVICES INSTEADOF ONLY ITS STATISTICALLY DEFINED NEEDS? A.Taking account of the demand for services only makes sense if the goalof the NHSC is to place physicians in areas which are financially able tosupport additional physicians but have not been able to attract them. Ibelieve that social needs will be better served by concentrating oncommunities and populations unable to afford additional medical care. Myresearch suggests that populations with the lowest use of medical carerelative to need has measured by mortality rates) clso tend to have lowerincomes than other population groups. Under these circumstances,. I don'tthink that measuring the economic demand for services should be given highpriority.--- 127 122 Q3THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE IS CURRENTLY CIRCULATING A DRAFT REPORTENTITLED'\"HEALTH SERVICE PROGRAM NEED ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE APPROVED.\"THIS REPORT IS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE FEDERAL DESIGNATION PROCESS FORUNDERSERVED AND SHORTAGE AREAS AND YOUR TESTIMONY SEEMS TO INDICATE YOUAGREE.WHERE DID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GO WRONG? A.AsIindicated in my written statement, the major problem has been anundue emphasis on the number of physicians relative to population in anarea.The designation process should focus on the use of servcies relativeto need (poor health). Medicare expenditures per enrollee and mortalitydata are,I believe, better building blocks than physician availability. Q4DO YOU FEEL THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORP: HAS BEEN OF SOME VALUE INSOLVING PROBLEMS OF PHYSICIAN DISTRIBUTION? AI believe that it has, but I also believe that its contribution could beincreased by shifting its focus to the least well-off populations. Q5IT WOULD BE lOGICAL TO NE THAT WHEN A SURPLUS OF PHYSICIANS EXIST, THEYDISPERSE OUT INTO THE TOWNS AND AREAS WITH LESS POPULATION AND ALSO LESSCOMPETITIONI ALSO HAVE ANECDOTAL AND SOME STATISTICAL EVIDENCE THATTHIS IS TRUE.HOWEVER, GIVEN THAT WE HAVE JUST ENTERED THE PERIOD WHENDOCTORS WILL BE ENTERING THE MARKETPLACE IN HUGE NUMBERS, IS IT TOO SOONTO BE ABLE TO ASSESS THE FULL EXTENT OF THIS PHENOMENA? APhysician supply has been growing rapidly since 1970. Thus,I believe that theprocess is well under way Our ability to measure and assess its magnitudeis hampered primarily by the lack of up-to-date data on physicians' earningsand their geographic distribution by small areas. 1 2 s 123Mr. GROSSMAN. Dr. Hadley, in revising the designation and Na-tional Health Service Corps placement process for underservedareas how can we take account of an area's demand for servicesinstead of only its statistically-defined needs?Dr. HADLEY. The demand for services in the absence of adequatefinancing is a difficult concept to identify. I think that is the rubthat is causing a lot of the confusion about the role of the HealthService Corps. I think it relates to my comment about there beingtwo competing and different objectives which one could impose onthe Corps.If tho. objective is to help physicians establish private practices incommunities that could potentially support a private practitioner,then I presume that there are a number of mechanisms relating towillingness or ability to pay that could be identified.If the objective is to place physicians in communities that do nothave the financial resources for whatever reason, then I think thedemand is probably closer and more akin to the need. It thenbecomes imperative to establish some sort of outside standard as towhat a reasonable level of the need is.Mr. GROSSMAN. Thank you.Mr. Bulger, one of the original purposes of the National HealthService Corps was to have Corps members stay in the arr3a afterthey finished their obligated service and develop their own privatepractice.Have any of the Corps members in your area of Boston donethat? If they have not stayed, why not? Are you aware of anyreasons why they have not?Mr. BULGER. Well, I think the great majority have stayed in thesites where they were practicing. As I said earlier, it is difficultsometimes for the health center to pick up the full salary that theNational Health Service Corps is picking up in its initial commit-ment, given the fact that the income that can be generated by thephysician really is not adequate without other grant support toprovide a cushion for a salary. I think that if there were adequategrant support in the second phase of commitment or placementlet us say a half placement that would be fundedI think thatwould be very helpful to centers in keeping on the National ServiceCorps placements for a second term.Mr. GROSSMAN.

Well, all of the statements will be accepted forthe record. You might wish to briefly summarize and take 3 or 4minutes, if you would want to.Dr. STEMMLER. Well, let me then read thy, prepared oral state-ment, although I would request, too, that a larger statement whichis more broad and all-encompassing be accepted for the record aswell.Mr. GROSSMAN. Each of your full statements will be inserted inthe record.Dr. STEMMLER. Thank you. Mr. Grossman.I am Dr. Edward J. Stemmler, dean of the University of Pennsyl-vania School of Medicine. I am here to represent the point of viewof the Association of American Medical Colleges.Given the time limits, I will restrict my comments to a synopsisof the association's key concerns, but request that the more lengthyexplication, as I said, of our position be entered into the hearingrecord.Clearly, the country is deeply engaged in an examination of theeconomic constraints within which this Nation must operate Central to this exercise is the question of the appropriate role of theFederal Government, in the host of activities perceived as necessaryto sustain or improve our Nation's social conditionLet me summarize why the AAMC believes that the Federalparticipation in the complex enterprise of medical education repre-sents an appropriate as well as an important utilization of Federalresources. The paramount fact is that the quality of medical carereceived by the people of this Nation is ulti.nately dependent uponthe excellence of the education received by medical students Fur-thermore, the international preeminence of the United States inbiomedical and behavioral research is directly related to the excelknce of the educational institutions in which many American sci-entists conduct their research. I must say it is nice to be first insomething. The continuation and enhancement of this superbrecord of innovation and creativity is vital to our Nation's future.Finally, Government investment in these educational institutionsin the recent past has unequivocally confirmed their value asinstruments of change in the immediate- and long-range implemen-tation of national health policy.Federal participation in the support of medical education hasserved the people of this Nation productively and should not be 125abandoned. The reauthorization of the basic health manpower pro-grams currently in force is now more necessary than ever, Medicalschools and affiliated teaching hospitals will in the next few yearsbe faced with unprecedented financial stresses that could compro-mise the very existence of some. Our institutions are dependentupon many revenue streams intermixed from a large and diversenumber of sources, many of which are highly insecure. The loss ofany one or group of these cannot necessarily be made up by others.Now, first let me discus student assistance. Two basic assump-tions underlie the AAMC's position on the future of student aidp.The first is that, in view of their high-income potential,allut the most severely disadvantaged students should ultimatelybe responsible for financing a significant portion of their medicaleducation, The second is that the cost of obtaining a medical educa-tion is becoming almost prohibitive for the average individual.Absent a reasonably comprehensive portfolio of financial aid pro-grams, the opportunity to secure an M.D. degree will be limited toonly the affluent; that is, those who are accustomed to and comfort-able with the notion of borrowing to achieve some future gain.Therefore, the association hopes that you will join us and shareour priorities that accord student assistance the highest impor-tance in the development of a new statute. We advocate that thenew statute provide: An appropriately balanced set of student as-sistance programs for all qualified students seeking access to medi-cal education, regardless of their economic status; manageable debtrepayment options, in recognition of the economic reality thatinitiation of repayment of loans is virtually impossible duringschool, residency, and a serious hardship in the very early years ofpractice; and an expanded opportunity for students to repay theirindebtedness through loan forgiveness programs.The association is disappointed to observe the disparity betweenthese specifications and the proposals currently embodied in S. 799.The scholarship program for students in exceptional financialneeda program that has helped many economically disadvan-taged youmen and women to become physiciansis terminated.Neither S. 799 nor S. 801 offer any substitute for the substantialfunds now available in scholarship support that will disappeargradually over the next 3 years under the proposed change in theNational Health Service Corps scholarship program. The adverseimpact of this loss without any offsetting replacement cannot beoverstated.The failure to continue the capitalization of the health profes-sions student loan program, a campus-administered student loanprogram with a modest Federal subsidy that has been extraordi-narily cost effective in assisting needy students to complete theireducation, is also very distressing in the face of the rapidly risingcosts of attending medical school.The cumulative impact of these deletions would make the HEALprogram, at its very high interest rates, the major vehicle forstudent assistance. On Monday, the rate of Treasury bills againexceeded 16 percent. Moreover, even HEAL borrowing is limited bythe low authorization ceilingsa puzzling proposal since the cost ofthis program to the Gov( 'ment is negligible. 131 126The association is deeply concerned that enactment of the limit-ed student assistance provisions of this bill would constitute disin-centives to students to undertake careers in primary care or topractice in underserved areas and fears that, in the long term,upward pressures on health care costs would be created.The limited access and high cost of HEAL loan money for stu-dents could be additionally and severely exacerbated by some ofthe extant proposals for reforming the guaranteed student loanprograin administered by the Department of Education.Let me discuss institutional support briefly. The AAMC's viewson this program are well known. While currently the amountallocated to each medical school is computed on the basis of stu-dent population, we emphasize that it is not primarily a form ofstudent subsidy. Institutional support is utilized for the stabiliza-tion of the medical center's entire mission, including service andcommunity outreach programs through discretionary interventions.The termination of institutional support proposed by this bill is,of course, of grave concern to our constituents. Institutional sup-port, small as itis,is the only accessible, uncommitted moneyavailable to many schools. The true value of these funds exceeds byfar their actual magnitude. They constitute the only source offunds to develop new and innovative programs and to meet unex-pected contingencies and emergencies caused by the vagaries in allforms of support.Now, the association would like to reiterate one important point,and that is that the medical schools of this Nation have been andcan continue to be powerful instruments of change. Remember,there are only 126 of them. Not a single problem identified byGovernment, be it the need for expanded enrollment, to improvegeographic distribution of physicians, to emphasize primary care,or to reorient medical practice to family medicine, had its solutioninitiated within the Government. Almost all, with the possibleexception of the HMO's, were innovations conceived in, and imple-mented on an experimental basis by, this country's schools of medi-cine or in the private sector.Many of these creative developments by the schools would nothave been possible without Federal institutional support funds thatserved to focus the attention of our faculties on the importance ofthe social, in addition to the scientific and technical dimensions ofmedical education. In the AAMC's opinion, this country has reapedenormous benefit from a small investment of public funds in thisprogram, and we regret that this bill fails to continue this support.I will not read the remaining testimony which relates to theother provisions, other than to point out our support for the specialprojects which must be identified as national priorities and sup-ported appropriately. The AAMC would also note that in the ab-sence of institutional funds to help cover the costs of those specialprojects, its constituents have grave concerns about their ability tocarry them out as you intend.So, in summary, S. 799, on balance, leaves much to be desired.The AAMC would be pleased to work with the committee in themodification of its initial proposal along lines that we believe haveearned public support, even in the stringent economic climate ofthese present difficult times.132 127Thank you, Mr. Grossman.[The prepared statement of the Association of American MedicalColleges follows:] 133 aril lc=itgatIlmasif esanierIcan Statement of theAssociation of American Medical CollegesonThe Health Professions EducationalAssistance i Nurse Training Act of 1981(S.799) The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) ispleased to have this opportunity to share with the Committee itsviews on 5.799, \"The Health Professions Educational AssistanceNurse Training Amendments of 1981.\" The interest of theAssociation in this legislation is self-evident. Since itsfounding in 1876, the AAMC has steadily expanded its horizonsso that today it represents the whole complex of individualorganizations and institutions charged with the undergraduateand craduate education of physicians. It serves as the nationalvoice for the 126 U.S. accredited medical schools and theirstudents; more than 400 of the mayor teaching hospitals; and over70 academic and professional societies whose members are engagedon an everyday basis in the activities - -- teaching, research andpatient care---that in the aggregate canotitute medicai education. Submittedtothe Oupoot CNclo, N.W /Washington. 0 C 200381(202)11211.0400 134 JUSTIFICATION OF FEDERAL SUPPORT OFMEDICAL EDUCATION Prior to oiscussing its specific program recommendations, the AAMC believes it is necessary to outline its views on the support of medical education.In reviewing recant developments, the RAMC has been impressed with the need for and justifiability of marshalling support from all parties who benefit from medical education. Students benefit from preparation to enter a well remunerated profession. Those who would place the entire burden of the cost of the education on the student do not appreciate that, in addition to their own living expenses and foregone earnings---opportunity costs---, each would have to bear institutional educational costs that currently average more than $20,000 per year. A burden of this magnitude would surely restrict the profession cf medicine to individuals from high income families.The extraordinary commitments of the states to medicaleducation indicate the recognition of the importance of medical schools to them. In academic year 1978-79, state support of public medical schools totaled 51.001 billion and these jurisdict. -s provided an additional 179 million to private schools; these amounts account for about 38% of the total operating revenues of the nation's medical schools. The states have borne and are bearing an unusually large share of the responsibility for financing medical education. 135 130 Nov, as in the past. the schools stake their claim on Federalresources on the fact that they are a national resource, engagedto a ailr'ficant degree in public service activities that impacton the whole nation and thus merit Federal subsidy. At this time,the country is currently extremely sensitive to, and deeply engagedin, an examination of the economic constraints within which thisnation must operate, both domestically and abroad. Central tothis exercise is an intense scrutiny of the entire spectrum ofprograms which realistically deserve Federal support. Thus, thefollowing points need to be made in support of the schtsols' claimthat Federal resources are warranted:The health needs of citizens throughout the country areserved by a system of medical education that uniformlyproduces highly competent physicians, based on nationalstandards and thus warranting national support.The high degree of geographic sebility of physiciansimbues them with the character of a national, rather thanlocal, resource and justifies Federal subsidisation ofthe schools which provide their education.Medical education requires subsidy because it is farmore expensive than most other graduate or professionaleducation programs, and is, in practical terms, beyondthe economic reach of many able, altruistic and wellmotivated students.The Federal Government entered into a partnership withmedical schools to achieve ,ozmonly agreed upon publicpu:.oses, the accomplishment an maintenance of whichrequire continuing mutual commitment. 1 3 6 131 The preeminent international stature the United Statesenjoys in biomedical and behavioral research is directlyrelated to the excellence of the educational institutionsin which many of our country's scientists conduct theirresearch.The continuation and enhancement of this superbrecord of innovation and creativity is vital to ournation's future.Past government investment of only a small fraction ofthe nation's health budget in these educational insti-tutions has demonstrated their value as instruments ofchange in the immediate and long-range implementationof national health policy. SPECIFIC PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS \u00a7tudent Assistance Rationale for AAMC Position Prior to addressing the specifics of the student aidproposals advanced by S.799, it is necessary to outline thebasic rationale upon which the Association's views on the future of student aid is predicated: In view of their future high income potential, allbut the most economically disadvantaged studentsand their families should ultimately bear responsibilityfor financing a significant portion of their medicaleducation thr ugh direct payment, loan repayr Int or service payback. 132 The cost of obtaining a medical education is becomingalmost prohibitive for the average individual. Tuitionshave increased dramatically over the past decade. Inprivate schools, the average first-year tuition hasincreased from $1,050 in academic year 1960-1961 to$7,910.Over this same epoch, the median first yeartuitions in public schools have grown from $498 forresidents to $2,070 and from $830 to $4,118 for non-residents.Without a reasonably comprehensive set ofaid programs, the opportunity to secure an M.D. degreewill be limited to only those fortunate enough to occupythe upper economic levels of our society---those who aremore accustomed to the notion of investing large sumsfor a future return. woThe period of training for an adequatelyeducated physician is long and arduous,usually encompassing a span of no lessthan seven and often several more years. woThe medical school curriculum is so rigorousand demanding as to make outside employmentto defray expenses virtually impossibleduring most phases. woMedical students who finance their educationthrough borrowing are faced with the prospectsof high and rapidly rising del,ts. The averagedebt of students with indebtedness who graduated 138 133 in 1980 was $17,200, up sharply and continuing to rise as tuition and living costs increase. The future of other forms of aid upon which medicalstudents have traditionally relied is now increasingly in doubt, particularly in light of the Administration'sproposals to cut the very valuable Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) Program. In academic year 1979-1980,35,183 medical students (55.1% of all medical students)received aid under this program, which provided 70.5% of all loans to these individuals. Criteria for StudentA careful analysis of the above factors, in light of theprevailing economic climate, has led the Association to conclude that student assistance is its highest priority and most urgentrecommendation in the development of new authorizing legislation. It is imperative that the Congress enact into law an appropriately balanced portfolio of programs designed to meet the needs of allqualified students seeking access to a medical education regardless of economic status. Such a structure should encompass: scholarships for the most disadvantaged students; subsidized loans for students with substantial needs; and market rate loans for the financially able. 130 134 The characteristics to be built into these programs obviouslymerit careful attention. Perhaps the most iuportant is the assuranceof availability of assistance. The enormous difficulties anduncertainties that have ensued due to oscillations in the availabilityof student aid in the last year are very undesirable and workedsevere hardships on the students and the schools. The recent upsand downs of the HEAL Program, with which the members of thisCommittee are all too familiar, are illustrative of this Point.Once students have gained acceptance into medical school, they shouldbe able to pursue their education with reasonable certainty thatassistance will be available until graduation. Several other criteriaare in.rinsic to a well designed and cost effective assistance struc-ture.The Association maintains that future student aid programsshould reflect the lessons of past experience and thus should: Establish manageable debt repayment oetions in recognitionof the economic reality that initiation of repayment ofloans is virtually impossible during undergraduate andgraduate medical education and may be a serious hardship duringthe very early years of practice when gross income is offset by the high expenses associated with startingup a practice.This situation will worsen as incomesare reduced by regulation and/or greater competition withthe increasing numbers of physicians entering practice. 140 135 Award assistance on the basis of need,, preferably atthe discretion of the financial aid officer at each medical school.It is crucial, particularly during the currenteconomic climate, that the limited financial resourcesavailable be distributed in the most cost-effective manner. Given the diversity of individual needs and circumstances and thecomplexities. of the various aid programs, theschool financial aid officers are the most qualifiedindividuals to make these determinations. Expand opportunities for students to repay their indebted- ness through loan forgiveness.The present provision forloan forgiveness has been oversubscribed. The Associationbelieves that service as a means of repayment will become an attractivealternative to many students as their level of indebtedness increases as well as more cost effectivefor the government than the National Bealth Service Corps.Loan forgiveness has the added advantage of not forcingstudents to make premature career choices of specialty. The Association must weigh student aid proposals in light of their potential to meet these important criteria. Student Aid Provisions of 5.799Because of these factors, the AAMC finds the student aidstructure envisioned by 5.799 to be of questionable wisdom fromthe perspective of all concernedthe students, the schools, and the Nation. In essence, the bill would circumscribe the current portfolio of assistance programs available to medical students under the health manpower statute. The cumulative impact of this would 1 ,1 136 be to make increasing numbers to rely solely on the HealthEducational Assistance Loan (HEAL) Program as the major vehiclefor aid.The Association would view this eventuality as short-sighted in terms of the country's social, medical and economicpolicies and responsibilities and suggests that the Committeeseriously consider the long-term consequences of adopting sucha policy.while the Association views on the specifics of theproposed student aid programs are discussed below, it wants tohighlight one primary recommendation: that members of thisCommittee throughly examine the failure of the bill to continuefunding for those programs---or to establish new mech,,nisms---designed to aid the most needy students, the Exceptional FinancialNeed (EFN) Scholarship Program and the Health Professions StudentLoan (HPSL) Program.The bill proposes to retain---at approximately its currentlevel---the successful special project grant program which isdesigned to encourage the application of minority and low incomestudents to medical schools. Yet the proposal does not providesubstantive loan or scholarship assistance for these students toactually pursue a medical education. Without aufficient accessto funds on reasonable terms, minority and low income studentswill be unable to realistically consider the prospect of becomingphysicians.Adoption of the proposal advanced by S.799 wouldguarantee this outcome and give credence to the unfortunatebut popular belief that a medical education can only be achievedby the affluent that is, those who are accustomed to and comfortablewith the notion of Lnvesting large sums for a futtu ! return. 142 137 Moreover, the Association is deeply concerned that onactaint ofthe bill' limited student assistance provisions would constitutedisincentives to students to undertake careers in primary careor to practice in underserved areas and fears that in the long-term, upward pressured on health care costs would be created.Outlined below are the AAMC's views on the specific programsAddressed by 8.799. Exceptional Financial Need (EFN) Scholarship ProgramsThe AAMC believes that the high costs involved in trainingphysicians mandate, as a matter of public policy, that specificprovisions be made to insure that even the most economicallydisadvantaged students not be denied access to a health professionscareer for financial reasons. Therefore, the Association deeplyregrets and strongly opposes the termination of the EIPN ScholarshipProgram envisioned by E.799. This Program has enabled the medicalschools to admit a socioeconomically heterogeneous cohort ofstudents and hes helped to limit the degree to which access to acareer in medicine has become a privilege of only the more affluent.In academic year 1979-1980, this Program permitted 340 needystudents to attend medical schools. The eliaibility criteriafor. this program are extremely stringent; until last summer, itwas restricted to those students with absolutely no resources.This definition of need was redefined last year as po ionof the lesser of $5,000 or half the annual student cost ofattending school. The Association is hard pressed to understandthe rationale for eliminating a d to such disadvantaged students 113 188 and strongly believes that it must be retained or a substitutemechanism provided. Health Professions Student Loan (HPSL) ProgramThe Association is puzzled by the decision not to continuecapitalization for the HPSL Program in light of its success fromthe viewpoint of both the students and the schools. The 1978Report of the AAMC Task Force on Student Financing found that theHPSL Program was an important factor in minimizing the debt burdenon economically disadvantaged students and concluded that:\"The HPSL program will help insure that the consequencesof the apparent Federal policy of having medical studentspay for a larger share of their educational costs doesnot fall disproportionately upon the economically disad-vantaged student, therefore effectively further limitingaccess to medical school for these students.\"As noted in its discussion of the EFN Scholarship Program, the AASICdeeply regrets and strongly opposes the proposed elimination ofassistance programs to this cohort of needy students. The Associationis also partictlarly disturbed by the decision not to continueappropriations for a loan program, particularly one whose uniquefeatures have oombined to establish it as a costeffective aid mechanism from the perspective of all partiesconcernedthe students, the schools and the Federal Government.This program:Permits aid to a suhstantial number of students who arein exceptional need but are unable to secure awardsunder the Exceptional Financial Need (EFN) Scholarship 144 Program---for one reason or another, i.e., are not intheir first year of school---but are hesitant to assumeburdensome REAL loans. For academic years 1978-1979and 1979-1580 respectively, awards to 9,808 and 7,646medical students were made under this program. Recognizes the unique needs of and the range of economiccircumstances presented by each student by providingfinancial aid officers with the flexibility necessary,to assemble student aid packages to fit individualrequirements. Authorizes funds received in repayment of loans by pastborrowers to be utilized for new loans to needy students.While this program is still young and repayments are justbeginning to approach steady state conditions, its reauthoriza-tion will eventuate in at least a partially self-sustaining,cost-effective means of financing aid to needy students thatis sound from both an economic and public policy perspective Provides a partial loan forgiveness option that servesas an effective device to attract physicians to underserved ,areas. Finally, the AAMC would like to express its support for thedecision to permit the revolving Binds to remain in the schoolsuntil FY 1986 as a highly cost-effective means of student financing. 145 83420 0 81 --- 10 140 Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) ProgramS.799 proposes to retain the HEAL Program established underP.L. 94-484 at a level considerably below its present authorizationceiling.The Association has long regarded the HEAL Program asone of last resort because of the enormous indebtedness burdenincurred.However, in view of the growing costs of medicaleducation and the vagaries in other forms of student aid, the AAMCbelieves that this ceiling should be expanded, particularly in viewof the fact that the risks and costs to the government are minimal.As noted above, the enthusiasm of the Association for thisProgram has been tempered because of the huge debt burden thatcurrent interest rates presage. Assuming that the loan wasnegotiated on a fixed rate basis, a student borrowing $10,000 ayear, or 540,000 aggregate under current rates of approximately18% (the bond equivalent 3f a 91 day Treasury bill plus 3.5%)would be liable to repay a total of 5188,860 over the minimumten year repayment period or 51,574 per month for 120 months,sometimes starting even before completion of residency training.The AAMC would like to express its support for the provisionsof S.799 designed to ease the Program's repayment burden and increasethe flexibility and accessibility of these loan funds by:Increasing the potential .,t11 and aggregate borrowinglimits to 320,000 and 58C.001 respectively;Removing the remaining eligibility restrictions onHEAL borrowers---the stipulation that no more than50% of each school's students can receive HEAL loans; 146 141 Providing for a graduated repayment option;Allowing deferral of repayment on both the principaland interest during specified periods of education,training and national service. While the Association endorses these modifications, it urges thatthe Committee make further efforts to lessen the costly repaymentrequirements that fall upon HEAL borrowers, by: Extending the deferral of repayment until completionof periods of national service and graduate medicaleducation.The Association believes that this would: esfacilitate bstter debt management by permittingborrowers to defer repayment until they are ina more realistic economic position to do so.Several residency programs now demand periodsof training of five or more years. act to reduce disincentives for young physiciansto serve in shortage areas. oenot lead to a significant increase in theGovernment's expenditures for this programs.Since HEAL is not a Federally subsidizedprogram, the costs to the Government of suchan improvement would be minimal. Finally, the AAMC would like to stress that the high debtburden that a student could incur under this Program has highly 142 undesirable economic and social consequences particularly inview of the possibility that adoption of 5.799 would leave themajority of medical students no choice but to obtain these loans.Members of the Committee should beware that high levels of indebtedness: May be a strong disincentive for physicians to enterpractice in primary care in rural and inner-city areaswhere they are most needed because these practice modesand areas are less likely to produce the necessaryincome to repay these debts. Could have a chilling effect upon the choice ofmedicine as a career by minority and financiallydisadvantaged students.Could result in additional 'pass through\" coststo the consumer and exacerbate the spiralinginflation of health care costs. The AAMC believes that these potential problems merit serious attention by the Congress. 148 143 Institutional Support A variety of cogent arguments may be advanced to justifygeneral Federal support to the institutions engaged in medicaleducation.One major theme is that the Federal Govern-ment, as an important beneficiary of the process, both :at itsown right and as an agent for the general public, should assumeits fair share of the unusually costly process. The Congressappears to have shared this conviction in 1971 and at that timerequested the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to assess the truecosts of medical education and to recommend what would constitutea fair share for the Federal Government to underwrite. The reportof the carefully crafted IOM study concluded that an appropriateFederal share would be about a third of the education programcosts.The Association found the IOM study well documented andpersuasively argued at the time of its publication, and canidentify nothing that has subsequently happened to invalidatethe arguments or reduce the force of the conclusions. A GAOReport in 1978 found institutional support was used effectivelyand for some institutions was critical to their fiscal stability,The clear trends in Congressional action on this issuesince the publication of the IOM Report have been to specify ineven greater detail what a school must do to receive a progressivelydwindling award. While education costs have nearly doubled, theper capita grant fell from 82,065 in FY 1972---barring rescissions---,to about $315 in 1972 dollars this year. This is the Federalcontributlon0 the support of institutions that have served aspowerful instruments of social change. Not a single mechanism 144 advocated by the Government - - -be it to expand medical schoolenrollment, to improve geographic distribution of physicians toemphasize primary care, to reorient medical practice to familymedicineoriginat-d within the Government. Almost all, withthe possible exception of HMO's, were innovations conceived inand implemented on an experimental basis by this country'sschools of medicine.This very minimal Government investment in these institutionshas unequivocally yielded a high return in immediate and long-range public benefits and has confirmed the value of theseinstitutions as a periennial resource of immaginative ideas forthe resolution of societal problems. Faculties of these schoolsare usually far ahead of other segments of society in recognizingproblems and in taking 'fliers' at their solutioas. The FederalGovernment's small, but vital contribution to the maintenance ofinstitutions that serve as major agents of innovation in thiscountry should not be abandoned. Potential Loss of Institutional SupportWhile currently computed on the basis of student population--considered at one time to be the most equitable formula forallocating these funds among eligible institutions---institutionalsupport is not primarily a form of student subsidy. Rather, taesefunds are utilized for the stabilization of an institution'sentire education program, thruugh discretionLry interventions atappropriate times and places. Institutional support, small as itis, is the only accessible uncommitted money available to many 145 schools.The real worth of these funds exceeds by far their rawmonetary value. Most medical school deans view them as the mostuseful at their disposal, the only source of funds to developthe new and innovative prcgrams the nation so desperately needsto advance the health of our people; and to meet unexpectedcontingencies and emergencies increasingly encountered in thisperiod of fiscal stringency.The schools have made commitments to educational programsthat hew to joint Federal/institutional objectives, perhaps ofhigher priority to the former than the latter. Cooperation withthe Government on these public-interest ventures is costly tothe schools.For examplo, the sponsor does not pay the full costs ofthe programs and contributes nothing to the cost of facultytime and effort involved in the planning of the programs,the development of new curricula, the preparation anaprocessing of applications, etc. Discretionary funds arecritically needed; to meet unmet institutional costs to theschools of joining hands with government in a wide variety ofactivities of great benefit to the whole nation; and especially,to deal with the turbulence induced by vacillations and oscillationsin federal commitments.There is a prevalent misperception that student financialassistance funds are essentially fungible with flexible institu-tional support and that schools can recoup the loss of these institu-tional funds by raising tuition, an option made viable by the fact thatstudents have access to loans or scholarships. This argument has very 15i 41,146 limited validity. While private schools have the theoretical freedomto increase tuition at whatever frequency and to whatever extent theydesire, tuitions in many of these institutions are already staggering.The result is that the social/economic/cultural/ethnic mix of thestudent body becomes a less representative and more elitist crosssection of America. For most public schools tuition increasesare not a viable option. Raising tuition is complicated, timeconsuming and cumbersome, often requires action by a Governor,a Legislature (which may meet only biannually), a Board of Regentsor a State Commission on Higher Education. The result of an increase is variable:in soma states, tuition is returned to the StateTreasury, deposited either a general or r dedicated account (e.g.,for retirement of construction indebtedness); in others, the increasedrevenue from tuition can and often will be offset by an equivalentdecline in appropriated funds. Thus, the use of student aid to compensate for the loss of the funds proposed by S.799 is not.in the Association's opinion. a viable option. As noted else-where, the States are already contributing heavily to the costsof medical education; imposing a Iurther burden upon them wouldprobably not be feasible or fair. Accordingly. the Associationis perSuaded that the Federal Government should continue todischarge its responsibility for providing the schools with aform of flexible institutional support.The integrity of a large number of medical schools is seriouslythreatened today by plethora of destablizing fiscal forces, whosecumulative impacts could be lethal, an outcome surely not in thepublic interest. Medical schools and affiliated teaching hospitals 152 147 will, in the next few years, be faced with unprecedented reductionsin revenues on several fronts---from service programs and, in termsof constant dollars, from severe reductions in research and researchtraining funds. The failure of the biomedical research budget tokeep pace with inflation, and the proposal to eliminate institu-tional support and overhead from training grants pose extremelydifficult problems for the schools, as large numbers of facultyare partially supported by Federal research dollars, dividing theirtime between, and deriving their compensation from, both educationaland research activities. If the Federal Government no longer wishesto utilize their research talents, are they expected to live on halfa salary?The economic reality is that some form of institutionalsupport is now more necessary than ever to maintain the innovation,creativity, integrity and very viability of these institutionsthat have dons so much to propel the United States to its positionof preeminence in medicine and biomedical and behavioral research.The potential impact of the termination of institutionalsupport envisioned by this proposal must be viewed in the context of:almost certain reductions in many revenue streams to medicalschools; the impact of inflation;and increased costs to the schools in complying with a hostof government regulations. The Association is firmly convincedthat the termination of institutional support proposed by thisbill will ultimately prove self-defeating for the nation'sscientific advancement, the viability of the schools and theadvancement of the health of our citizens. The Committee'sacceptance or rejection of the proposition advanced by 5.799must be a carefully weighed decision and one which is fullycognizant of the potential implications of such an action. 1. 148 21 Special Project Grant Program Special project grants complement in very important waysthe other mechanisms for Federal assistance to medical education.Under this rubric, solutions to specific societal problems canbe sought through what are really cost reimbursement contractsbetween the Government and institutions possessed of the resourcesto implement the project. These grants offer schools modestincentives to undertake a wide variety of innovative educationalactivities that the Federal Government views as having high priorityin terms of the public interest.The great virtue of these grant programs is that they can coveran extremely broad range of objectives and are ideal for capitalizingto the maximum on the rich diversity represented among the schools.However, special project awards seldom really reflect full costs.without the availability of some other Federal subsidy, such abinstitutional support, the schools will be forced to subsidi7: theseprojects from their extremely scarce institutional resources.The Association is heartened that S.799 reauthorizesseveFal of the genres of activities, initiated under P.L. 94-484.that have proven successful in addressing problems of nationalconcern.The AAMC would like to take this opportunity to specificallyendorse the renewal authorities for: Training Grants in FamilyMedicine, General Internal medicine and Pediatrics; Departmentof Family Medicine; Area Health Education Centers; and EducationalAssistance to Ind!.viduals from Disadvantaged Backgrounds. All of 154 these programs have proven very successful in helping toameliorate major problems confronting the health profes-sions today:the geographic and specialty maldistribution ofphysicians; and, the recruitment and retention of minority andlow income students in medical schools.However, thi Association is seriously disturbed by the factthat the proposed authorization levels for these programs---withthe exception of Disadvantaged Assistance---are well below theircurrent level of funding. As evidenced by the Table below, the levelsproposed by S.799 would not maintain these programs at theirFY1980 leveleven in FY 1982, assuming that the full amountsauthorized FamilyMedicine 56.0 32.0 70.6 Area HealthEducationCenters21.0 16.0 26.5 1982 constant dollars. based on the Administration'seconomic projections which reveal that the increase in the CPI wasequal to 13.5% in FY 1980 and will decrease to 11.1% in FY 1981. 150 The Association believes that adoption of the authorization levelsproposed would seriously undermine these programs and impede theongoing efforts to ameliorate the shortage of primary care physi-cians and the problems of underserved areas. Specifically,, The growing popularity of the primary care specialtiesis a hopeful sign that the primary care health needsof the Nation, will be better served in the near future.These specialties are at a critical stage of development---new programs must be designed, existing programsimproved,,curricula developed, facilities constructedor renovated, teachers recruited or trained. Theseprograms have been highly effective in developing primarycare professionals and sufficient funds are urgentlyneeded to maintain momentum by providing support ata time when the other source of funding throughreimbursement for medical services Is being constrained.Area Health Education Centers. AHECs have proven to besuccessful in attracting and retaining health professionalsin medically underserved areas in a positive and voluntaryfashion.The Department of Health and Human Services hasestimated that these programs currently serve a populationof approximately 58 million people. Adoption of thefunding ceilings embodied in 5.799 could only detract fromand more than likely impair, the efforts of this program. Overall, despite the public and the Congress' desire to hold downFederal spending wherever possible, reduction of the authorizationceilings of programs that have been successful in ameliorating theproblems of geographic and specialty maldistribution of physiciansis self-defeating and should not be taken without thorough exploration 1 5 6 151 Financial Distress The Association is pleased to note that the bill retainsand revises programs designed to assist medical schools infinancial distress and that it establishes a separate authorityfor this purpose. The Association believes that this authorityis essential to the continued viability of our country's predomin-antly minority institutions and probably for an increasing numberof non-minority schools that will experience fiscal problemswhen other support programs are curtailed.The AAMC is particularly heartened that S.799recognizes that schools experience different levels of fiscaldifficulty by establishing both short and long-term mechanismsto address these problems.However, the Association is opposed to any requirementsfor an institution to obtain state funding in order to beeligible for the financial distress program. 5.799 mandatesthat schools qualifying for assistance under the Advanced GrantProgram must secure \"a legally binding commitment to receive agrant or contract from a state or local government, privateentity or combination thereof for the exclusive purpose ofalleviating such school's financial distress.\" That virtuallyall of the institutions in chronic financial distress areprivate sector minority schools is well known. Since theseinstitutions serve a national constituency, state governmentshave been very reluctant to come to their aid, as they would for a st=e controlled institution. Since the institutions in distresshave no control over their access to state eupport, such arequirement is unfair and ill conceived. 152 25 Construction P.L. 94-484 extended the existing grant program of assistancefor construction and renovation of teaching facilities and author-ized a new program to assist in the construction of ambulatoryprimary care teaching facilities. These programs were designed toachieve the dual goal of expanding enrollment and encouraging theteaching of primary care. In recognition of the growing perceptionthat the stimulation of enrollment increases is no longer necessaryor desirable, S.799 proposes to: repeal the enrollment increaserequirement in the existing construction grant program: and relieveprevious construction grant recipients of their obligations toincrease their enrollments. The Association views these as timelymodifications that represent sound public policy.In addition,, this bill proposes substantial revisions inconstruction authorities. Zt would: eliminate all new constructiongrant authority: and provide support through loan guarantees andinterest subsidies only for the \"construction, conversion, renova-tion, or modernization\" of existing facilities :or use as ambulatoryprimary care teaching facilities. The Association questions thewisdom of completely eliminating construction grant authority forexisting schools. Many existing educational \"plants\" are clearlyin need of replacement---a need which is sure to grow; and, theAMC seriously doubts the viability of the mechanism proposed toaddress the already existing serious need for ambulatory teachingfacilities in primary care. The Association strongly recommendsthat the Committee accord these problems a more thorough assessment. 158 153 Predominantly hinority Institutions There are new as well as established medical schools whosestudent bodies are comprised predominantly of individuals fromminority groups, drawn from all over the country. As privateinstitutions, they have very limited call upon state support andprivate philanthropy has not met their needs.Thus, these institutions which meet an important social goal---the education and training of physicians representative of theminority groups in our society---must depend heavily on the FederalGovernment for support. Most medical schools have made valiantattempts to expand enrollment of underrepresented minorities; theminority enrollment of first-year medical students increased from292 in 1962 to 1,548 in 1980. However, our country still has along way to go before it achieves equality in the health professions.Today, minorities constitute only 9% of the total population of first-year medical school classes. In its present form 5.799 does notadequately address the needs of either these students or schools.Thus,the AMC urges that the Committee make every effortto give sensitive attention to the plight of minoritiesand the existing minority institutions in formulatingnew legislation. 1.5D 154 Overall Summary and Conclusions The introduction of 5.799 and the House proposal, H.R.2004has opened debate on the policy issues fundamental to the future of thehealth of this nation. The AMC has outlined to the Committee thebroad policy perspective which it endorses on Federal financialassistance to medical students and to medical education and hasevaluated the pending proposal in the light of this perspective: itstands ready, willing and able to provide any further assistanceto the Committee that is desired.But in closing, the point should be reiterated that thelegislation that finally emerges through the long process ofCongressional debate is of critical significance to a set ofinstitutions whose health and well-being is of enormous importance to the nation. During the twentieth century, the quality ofAmerican medical education went from uneven and often mediocreto a level of uniform excellence. A glance at the advances inprevention,, diagnosis and treatment, made possible by progressin medical sciences during only the past decade, gives amplecredence to this statement. It must be emphasized that theseaccomplishments would not have been possible without Federal support.In the course of this notable growth, the health ofthe Ration has benefited considerably and every evidence s Bests that the best is yet to come.The action taken by the Congress on this legislation willhave a profound Impact on the future of medical education and,through it, on the future health and vitality of our people. 1 6 0 155Mr. GROSSMAN. Thank you, Dr. Stemmler.Dr. Bowie?Dr. Bowie. Thank you, Mr. Groesman.I am Walter C. Bowie, dean of the school of veterinary medicineat Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Ala. I am here today to repre-sent the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools, whichincludes the school of medicine at Morehouse College; the MeharryColleges of Medicine and Dentistry, represented here today byinterim president, Dr. Richard Lester; the Charles R. Drew PostGraduate Medical School; the Xavier University of Louisiana Col-lege of Pharmacy, represented here today by executive vice presi-dent Tony Rochelle; the Florida A. & M. University School ofPharmacy; the Texas Southern University School of Pharmacy;and the institution that I represent, the Tuskegee Institute Schoolof Veter. nary Medicine.Our association is aware of the time and energy that this com-mittee has invested in preparing sound legislation to address thehealth professions needs of our Nation. We are also aware of thesevere budget limitations that have been placed on this committeeby the state of our Nation's economy. Keeping this in mind, Sena-tor Hatch and his staff have spent many hours visiting with healtheducators, reviewing legislative hearing records, and confrontingthe very real question of how to get the most out of limited dollarresources.There is one aspect of the health manpower issue, however, thathistorically has not been adequately addressedthe responsibilityof the Federal Government to support and multiply the successesof minority health professions schools in addressing a nationalpriority.This national priority is the production of more health careproviders from disadvantaged backgrounds. This priority was ar-ticulated by Senator Hatch in his remarks when he introduced S.799 on March 25, 1981. The members of the association agree thatthat perception of the need for more health professions personnelfrom minority and disadvantaged backgrounds is one that needs tobe addressed.The schools in our association have an unsurpassed record inaddressing this national priority. Our schoola have graduated 90percent of all black veterinarians in the Nation, 50 percent of theNation's black pharmacists, and 43 percent of the Nation's blackphysicians and dentists. In spite of the success of our efforts, blackscomprise only 1.7 percent of the physicians, 2.2 percent of thedentists, 2 percent of the pharmacists, and 0.7 percent of the veter-inarians in this country. Similar deficiencies exist for health pro-fessionals from other minority groups.In 1976, with the passage of Public Law 94-484, support wasprovided to health professions schools by the Federal Governmentto increase student enrollments. Through this support, attentionwas given to increasing minority student enrollment and to sup- porting training programs in primary care. Despite this support,even if we accept the possibility of a physician surplus in the foreseeable future, I think it is absolutely clear that there is nooversupply of minority health professionals. 83-520 0 -81 - - 11161 156In order for blacks to achieve parity of representation in thehealth professions, we need to increase the number of black physi-cians from the current 9,000 to 42,000; the number of black dentistsfrom the existing 3,000 to 15,000; the number of black pharmacistsfrom the current 2,500 to 15,000; and the number of black veterin-arians from the existing 400 to 4,300.In the absence of institutional support, it is obvious that otherapproaches must be supported to insure adequate numbers ofhealth professionals from disadvantaged backgrounds. One ap-proach is section 787(a) of the Public Health Service Act, whichprovides special project funding for educational assistance to stu-dents from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our association is pleasedto note the continuation of this program in S. 799.An additional approach is the direct support of health profes-sions schools that serve as national priority institutions. Such insti-tutions are those that are training the kind of health care provid-ers needed by the Nation and whose student population is largelycoming from disadvantaged or minority backgrounds. We believethat the mechanism for such a program is possible by adding a newfeature to section 787 of the Public Health Service Act. Let mecomment very briefly on this section of the legislation.Section 787 of the Public Health Service Act has become knownas the HCOP, or the health careers opportunity program, provi-sion. Aside from the direct support to national priority institutions,this program is the only vehicle the Federal Government has toinsure the recruitment, retention, and graduation of disadvantagedstudents from all health professions schools.The association applauds the committee for recognizing the con-tinued need for the HCOP programs, and recommends that thecurrent funding level of $20 million be provided for the fiscal years1982 through 1984.The primary focus of the schools represented by this associationis parallel and in keeping with the objective of the legislation as socarefully outlined by Senator Hatch in his introduction of thisrevised health manpower legislation. These institutions see as theirreasons for being the emphasis on training in primary care, thepreparation of students to go into the underserved areas, and theprovision of program efforts designed to attract and retain disad-vantaged students who seek careers in the health professions. Wenote particularly the committee's recognition of the need for assist-ing some of our institutions to survive limited periods of financialdistress.For all of the reasons given above, the institutions of this associ-ation are truly national priority institutions. Therefore, of primaryimportance to our institutions is the need to provide some generaloperational suppert because of our unique commitment to under-take the goals of this legislation. We therefore recommend that thecommittee expand section 787 of the Pubh Health Service Act soas to provide ccncurrent general support so urgently needed inorder that our schools will be able to carry out our mission.The association is pleased with the two-tier financial distressprogram provided by sections 166 and 167 in S. 799. In the ad-vanced financial distress program, we recognize the need forschools to join in partnership with the Federal Government to162 157bring financial stability to the institutions. However, we are deeplyconcerned that the matching requirement in the first year of thecontract period would preclude the participation of those schoolsfor which we believe this section was intended.It is clear today that none of our institutions would be eligible orwould be able to receive benefits of this section because of thestringent and near-impossible requirements of the first year's con-ditions.To achieve the same consequences intended by this section,whereby schools in partnership with the public and private sectorsbring financial stability to institutions in financial distress, werecommend and urge that the two-tier financial distress programbe adopted as proposed by the chairman, but that the method ofFederal participation be phased in over the 5-year period of thecontract.Let me then now summarize the rest of our concerns because ofthe time element, and I recognize that time is of the essence.In summary, let me just say very briefly that we would like tosee some serious consideration being given to the following compo-nents of the legislation: One, the enactment of a new feature ofsection 787 of the Public Health Service Act to provide direct,general support to national priority institutions that are trainingthe type of health care providers needed by the Nation; two, thephase in of the matching grant requirement in the advanced fina i-cial distress program; three, the provision of adequate student fi-nancial assistance to students from disadvantaged backgrounds,four, the continuation of the health careers opportunity program atthe current level of authorization, five, the inclusion of authorityfor construction grants to new, private, 2-year medical schools, six,the inclusion of an authority for conversion projects to assist new,private, 2-year schools of medicine to develop into degree-grantinginstitutions.To you, Mr. Grossman, and to the members of the committee, Iwish to say that I appreciate this opportunity to represent theAssociation of Minority Health Professions Schools We look for-ward to working very closely with you and the other members ofthe staff in insuring that adequate support is available to disadvan-taged students and for the national priority institutions that havehistorically provided the opportunity for health careers to thesestudents.Thank you very much.Mr. GROSSMAN.

Xavier University of Louisi-ana College of Pharmacy; Florida A & H University School of Phar-macy; Texas Southern University School of Pharmacy; and TuskegeeInstitute School of Veterinary Medicine.Senator Hatch, our Association is aware of the time andenergy you and Members of your Committee have invested in preparingsound legislation to address the health professions needs of ournation.We are also aware of the severe budget limitations thathave been placed on your Committee by the state of our nation'seconomy.Keeping this in mind. you and your staff have spentmany hours visiting with health educators, reviewing legislativehearing records, and confronting the very real question of howto get the most out of limited dollar resources.There is one aspect of the health manpower issue, however,that historically has not been adequately addressed the respon-sibility of the federal government to support and multiply thesuccesses of minority health professions schools in addressinga national priority.The national priority is the production of more health careproviders from disadvantaged backgrounds. This priority was Z65, 160 articulated in P.L. 94-484, in the September, 1980 Graduate Med-ical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) report tothe Secretary, and in your remarks, Senator Hatch, when you intro-duced S.799 on. March 25, 1981. The members of the Associationagree with your perception of the need for more health professionspersonnel from minority and disadvantaged backgrounds.The schools in our Association have an unsurpassed recordin addressing this national priority. Our schools have graduatedninety percent of all black veterinarians in the nation, 50 percentof the nation's black pharmacists,, and 43 percent of the nation'sblack physicians and dentists. In spite of the success of ourefforts, blacks comprise only 1.7 percent of the physicians,, 2.2percent of the dentists, 2.0 percent of the pharmacists,, and 0.7percent of the veterinarians in this country, (Table 1). Similardeficiencies exist for health professionals from other minoritygroups.In 1976 with the passage of P.L. 94-484, support was providedto health professions schools by the federal government to increasestudent enrollments. Through this support, attention was givento increasing minority student enrollment, and to support fortraining programs in primary care. Despite this support, evenif we accept the possibility of a physician surplus in the forseeablefuture, it is clear that there is no oversupply of minority healthprofessionals. The facts are as follows:During the ten year period from 1971 to 1981the percentage of freshman medical studer.:swho are black decreased from 7.1% tc 6.6%.The percentage of medical school graduateswho are black remains at less than 6%. (Table II) 166 161 From 1971 to 1979 the precentage of blackfreshman dental students declined from 5.2%to 4.4%.(Table III).From 1971 to 1980 the percentage of blackpharmacy students rose slightly from 3.7%to 4.2%.(Table IV). Approximately one-halfof the black pharmacy students are currentlyenrolled In historically black schools ofpharmacy.In order for blacks to achieve parity of representationin the health professions we need to increase the number of blackpnysicians from the current 9,000 to 42,000; the number of blackdentists from the existing 3,000 to 15,000; the number of blackpharmicists from the current 2,500 to 15,000; and the number ofblack veterinarians from the existing 252 to 4,300.Beyond the issue of parity is the fundamental questionof the patient population of practicing black physicians. AsDr. Alvin Tarlov, Chairman of GMENAC,, and Chairman of the Depart-ment of Internal Medicine at the Pritzker School of Medicine at theUniversity of Chicago,, indicated in testimony before the House Subcommitteeof Health and the Environment on March 4, 1981, 80 percent ofthe patient-load of black physicians is black, while only 7 percentof the patient-load of white physicians is black. The schoolsof our Association can be proud of our contributions to addressingthe problem of provider maldistribution because 76 percent of thephysicians graduated by our schools practice primary care,, and46% practice in rural areas.Studies performed by the University of Chicago, and funded inpart by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, indicat, 1 6 7 162 that there is a category of Americans who are the hard-core\"structurally underserved.\" It seems from these studies thatthere exists a significant group of Americans who do not seea physician at all. Reasons for this are cultural and languagebarriers, geographic isolation, and other factors. Most ofthe structurally underserved are found in inner city areas orin remote rural areas, and are usually socio-economically disad-vantaged and often from minority groups. (Table V).In the absence of general institutional support, it isobvious that other approaches must be supported to ensure adequatenumbers of health professionals from disadvantaged backgrounds.One approach is section 787(a) of the Public Health Service Actwhich provides special project funding for educational assistanceto students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our Association ispleased to note the continuation of this program in S. 799.An additional approach is direct support of health professionsschools that serve as national priority institutions. Such insti-tutions are those training the kind of health care providers neededby the nation, and whose student population is 50% or more fromdisadvantaged or minority backgrounds. We believe, Mr. Chairman,that the mechanism for such a program is possible by adding a newfeature to section 787 of the Public Health Service Act. I ampleased to begin my discussion of S. 799 on that section relatedto \"Educational Assistance to Individuals from Disadvantaged Back-grounds.\" 168 163 Educational Assistance to Individuals from Disadvantaged BackgroundsMr. Chairman, section 787 of the Public Health Service Act,(section 168 of S. 799) has become known as the HCOP (Health CareerOpportunity Program)provision. Aside from direct support to nationalpriority institutions, this program is the only vehicle the federalgo\"ernment has to ensure the recruitment, retention, and graduationof disadvantaged students from all health professions schools.The Association applauds the Committee for recognizing thecontinued need for HCOP and recommends that the current fundinglevel of $20 million be provided for fiscal years 1982-1984.mr. Chairman,, as you know, the primary focus of the schoolsrepresented by this Association is parallel and in keeping withthe objective of the legislation as so carefully outlined by youin your introduction of this revised health manpower legislation.These institutions see as their reasons for being the emphasison training in primary care, the preparation of students to gointo the underserved areas, and the provision of program effortsdesigned to attract and retain disadvantaged students who seekcareers in the health professions. We note particularly theCommittee's recognition of the need for assisting some of ourinstitutions to survive limited periods of financial distress.For all of the reasons given above, the institutions of thisAssociation are truly national priority institutions. Therefore,of primary importance to our institutions is the need to providesome general operational support because of our unique commitmentto undertake the goals of this legislation. We therefore recommend t6L 164 that the Committee expand section 787 of the Public Health ServiceAct (which provides educational assistance to individuals fromdisadvantaged backgrounds) so as to provide concurrent supportso urgently needed in order that our schools will be able to carryout our mission.Financial DistressThe Association is delighted with the two-tier financialdistress program provided by sections 166 and 167 in S. 799. Asyou know, Hr. Chairman, we have been advocating this approach formany years now.In the Advanced Financial Distress program) we recognizethe need for schools to join in partnership with the federal govern-ment to bring financial stability to the institutions. However,we are concerned that the matching grant requirement in the firstyear of the contract period would pre.:lude the participation ofthose schols for which we believe this section was intended. Itis clear today that none of our institutions would be eligible orable to receive the benefits of this section because of the strin-gent and near impossible requirements of the first year's conditions.To achieve the same consequences intended by this section,whereby schools in partnership with the public and private sectorsbring financial stability to institutions in financial distress,we recommend and urge that the two-tier financial distress programbe adopted as proposed by the Chaitman Senator Hatch, but that asubstitute method of federal participation be reintroduced as was 10 165 earlier endorsed by Secretary Schweiker who was at the time aMember of this Committee.We therefore urge this section read as follows:\"No school may receive support under this sectionfor more than five years. No grant or contract forsupport under this section shall be in an amountgreater than (1) 75 percentum in the third year, (2)50 percentum in the fourth year, and (3) 25 percentumin the fifth year, or the average annual amount receivedin the first two years of federal grant or contractsupport under this section.\"We believe this woula achieve all of the objectives of theCommittee in reducing the federal involvement in financing theprograms of institutions; at the same time, it would permit alogical and orderly method for involving provate, state and otherresources to become available to us in a manner that will ensurepermanency and stability.In order th ensure appropriate allocation of the dollarsprovided for sections 166 and 167, we also recommend separatefunding authorizations for each section.Student AssistanceMr. Chairman, we are concerned about the increasing numberof low and middle income students who cannot afford a healthsciences education. We have historically sought out and encouragedyoung people to develop their talents and to acquire needed skills. Theseskills are being used to improve the quality of life forall Americans. Yet,, the economics of the 1980s could force ourinstitutions to seek only those students who could afford to pay 171 166 from their own resources for graduate and professional edu-cation.Therefore, we support a student financial assistanceprogram that would maintain the concept of choice.A student financial need profile was presented by memberinstitutions of the Association to t:le House Subcommittee onHealth and the Environment on October 5, 1979 and again onMarch 21, 1980. The student financial need profile reflects thefollowing.)(sherry Medical C011ege - In kvaping with thishistoric and unique mission the College enrollsmore disadvantaged students than any other medicalschool in the United States. Some 86, of ourstudent body requests and receives financial aidto help them pay tuition and other expenses.\"School of Medicine at Morehouse C011ege - \"Seven-teen of the students in the Charter Class (24 students)were recipients of National Health SErvice CorpsScholarships, another was the recipient of anExceptional Financial Need Scholarship, one wasthe recipient of an Armed Forces Health ProfessionsScholarship.Three of the remaining studentsreceived scholarships and loans from variousprivate sources, including medical school funds.\"Xavier University of Louisiana School of Pharmacy -\"Our current tuition rate of $2,650 per year isbelow the national average of $3,100 for privateschools of pharmacy, but the economic status of ourstudents in proportionately far lower than that oftheir peers in other institutions.\"Given the financial need profiles of students enrolled in theinstitutions of our Association, an effective student assistanceprogram is needed.We note with some disappointment the absence of a scholarshipgrant program in S. 799.While we recognize the short-term costs 172 167 of a scholarship program, we are painfully aware of the long-tercosts of an inadequate supply of targeted health care professionals.A high percentage of these targeted health professionals have alreadybeen identified as socio-economically disadvantaged. Increasedloan burden after undergraduate school debt is a certain disincen-tive for disadvantaged students to pursue a health career. Werecommend, Senator Hatch,, the retention of at least the ExceptionalFinancial Need program, with modifications that provide for arange 66 grant awards indexed to a range of income circumstances.Within a defined ceiling, we believe this approach will eliminatethe arbitrary cut-off of awards between students with only $100difference in their incomes.We are supportive of a federally insured loan program thatwould provide low interest subsidized loans to nzedy studentsseeking a career in the health professions.We have also been supportive of the National Health ServiceCorps program. We have noted in S. 799 the transfer of authorityfor the'program from Title VII to Title III of the Public HealthService Act.We in the Association are aware of the cost impli-cations of the Corps program, and therefore strongly urge continuedsupport for other programs that provide student financial assistance.Facilities ConstructionWe are pleased that the Committee has included support forthe construction, conversion,, renovation or modernization of teaching facilities.We are concerned,, however, that this section does not 1 7) 168 provide priority funding for the construction of basic sciencesfacilities to assist private two-year medical schools in becomingfour-year schools of medicine, nor does it provide specific conversionsupport to assist private two-year schools meet the conditions ofthe Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME).Therefore,, we recommend that priority funding be given to privatetwo-year medical schools in the construction of basic sciencesfacilities, and that conversion support to private two-year schoolsof medicine be granted, the amount of which shall be $50,000 foreach third-year student as existed under previous authorities.ConclusionMr. Chairman, in summary, we urge the following: 1.The enactment of a new feature of section 787of the Public Health Service Act to provide directgeneral support to national priority institutionsthat are training the type of health care providersneeded by the nation. 2.The phase-in of the matching grant requirementin the Advanced Financial Distress program. 3.The provision of adequate student financialassistance to students from disadvantages backgrounds. 4.The continuation of the Health Careers Opportunityprogram at level funding. 5.The Inclusion of authority for construction grantsto new private two year medical schools. 6.The inclusion of an authority for conversionprojects to assist new private two year schools ofmedicine to develop into degreee granting institutions.Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee,, I appreciate theopportunity to represent the Association of Minority Health ProfessionsSchools before you today. We look forward to working closely withyou and your staff in ensuring that adequate support is availableto disadvantaged students,, and for the national priority institutionsthat have historically provided the opportunity for health careersto these students. 174 Table I HEALTHPROFESSIONALS E.

Dr. Estes, could you summarize your statement?We will enter the full statement in the record.Dr. EsT Es. Yes; thank you, Mr. Chairman.GMENAC has already delivered its report and has concludedthat the absolute numbers of physicians is no longer a problem andthat a surplus may be present in 1990. This committee also project-ed that the number of primary-care physicians, such family physi-cians and primary-care internists and pediatricians, would be atabout the proper level by 1990.However, this report was based on an assumption that the cur-rent number of training programs in these primary care special-ities would remain present as they are now throughout this decadeof the 1980's. There is good reason to believe that this will not bethe case unless continued support is available for these programs. Recommendation 21 of the GMENAC report states that it is theirrecommendation that support for primary care and family medi-cine be continued during the next period of time.My own characterization of these programs is that they are hothouse plants that are unable at this moment to stand the rigorsof the outside world. They cannot survive for two major reasons. They must derive their support by one of two or three mechanisms.They must derive their support from income from patient care,from sponsoring hospitals, or from sponsoring medical schools.Current insurance-based, fee-for-service payment systems place a high value on the performance of technical services, such as surgi-cal procedures, diagnostic exams, and laboratory tests. But thebackbone of primary-care practice is listening, the provision, theeducation of the patient, and the prevention of illness throughthese mechanisms and processes. These activities, under most in-surance plans, are either not covered at all, or when they arecovered, the payments allowed are insufficient to cover the cost ofproviding services. Thus, the primary-care physician is at a consid- erable competitive disadvantage when compared to other physi-cians.The seasoned, primary-care physician practicing in his own officeis able to overcome this by providing a very highly efficient, tightoffice practice that builds on a lot of prior knowledge of the pa-tient. The teaching environment in which these physicians arebeing trained cannot approach this level of efficiency, and mostexperts in the field estimate that no more than one-third to one-half of the operating costs of running these clinics could, underoptimal circumstances, be provided by patient care income.Why can they not be supported by the hospitals of which theyare a part? These are programs which, in general, do not encour-age patients to come into the hospital; they tend to keep patientsout of the hospital rather than utilizing fully the hospital s facili-ties and services. In a time when the hospital also is facing cuts inmedicare and stringencies of other types, hospitals trustees areoften willing to see the family practice residency go in order toforgo an increase in the per diem cost.The third option is further support from the medical schools. Wehave already heard that the medical schools are facing stringenciesof their own in the financial area. Primary-care programs in gener- al, and family medicine programs in particular, have not always f, 175been welcomed in the medical schools. These programs are notunderstood by highly specialized and subspecialized faculties, andunder demand of stringencies in cost everywhere, there is someevidence that those schools might be willing to see these programsgo rather than to support them and to further cut other programs. Medical schools, like hospitals, are having a hard time keepingcosts down. These programs have enabled family medicine, primarycare, internal medicine, and pediatrics to be established and to pickup speed, but their stability in this setting remains to be seen.In addition, the withdrawal of Federal funds for family medicineand primary care, while funds for research through NIH are pre-served, may give deans and traditional medical school faculty thewrong message, that the geographic and speciality distribution ofphysicians is no longer important and that medical school prior-ities could revert back to the 1960 emphasis on research, hightechnology, and supersubspecialization, without regard to publicneeds.Are these programs worth saving? My own answer is a resound-ing \"Yes,\" and I believe that a majority of the public could agreeThese programs are producing products which provide cost effec-tive, reasonably priced medical services which are readily accessi-ble and much more evenly dispersed than could otherwise be pro-vided. The experience of the past indicates that these programscannot and will not be produced unless special programs are inplace.Experience of the past 10 years indicates that the products ofthese programs have indeed provided primary care and have dis-tributed themselves more widely than other physicians. The evi-dence from family medicine is most impressive The attrition fromthis field has been almost nonexistence. Half of the graduates havegone into towns of less than 25,000 people. Evidence indicates thatthey do provide less expensive care.The next question that I think should be addressed is, can theseprograms ever survive? My answer is \"Yes,\" but with a stringentqualification. Currently, there are no major rewards for cost-saving behavior on the part of either the physician or the patient. Ibelieve that the currently proposed procompetitive health plans, byproviding a mechanism for rewarding cost-effective health behaviorby physicians, will provide an environment in which primary carecan not only survive, but perhaps flourish The current payment system provides great financial rewards tophysicians who do more, especially technical procedures, and penal-izes those who spend time and effort to prevent illness and whobelieve that listening sympathetically can be better sometimesthan a test or a tranquilizer.So, I answer that modification of the current payment systemwhich will encourage groups of physicians, insurance companies,HMO's, and other entities to provide highly effective care willprovide the primary-care physician with a means to survive and, inaddition, will provide training programs with an opportunity tosurvive as well. In the absence of these, I think the ground isshaky.In summary, it is essential that family medicine and other pri-mary care residency training programs be carefully nourished and 1 s i 176protected over the next few years. Otherwise, they may not survive and the gains of the past 10 years will be lost.Thank you very much for allowing me to present my views. [The prepared statement of Dr. Fetes follows:] 182 Testimony before: Committee on Human ResourcesOrrin G. Hatch, Chairman By: E. Harvey Estes, Jr., M.D.Professor and ChairmanDepartment of Community and Family MedicineDuke University School of MedicineDurham, North Carolina 27710 Date: Wednesday, April 8, 1981 In the late 1960's and early k970's, there was a broad percepticn of aninadequate supply of physicians, an uneven distribution between generalist andspecialty /subspecialty physicians, andanequally uneven distribution between rural and inner city areas and the more affluent suburbs and moderate size cities.In order to correct these problems, the Federal Government began to reward medical schools for increasing the numbers of students accepted into medical schools. The Federal Government and the States also encouraged the creation of new medical schools. These activities were aimed at increasing the total supply of physicians, but without specifically directing the specialty training of graduates of medical schools.By tne early 1970's itwas apparent that these efforts at increasing numbers were not correcting geographic or specialty maldistribution. The year1971 marked the first targeted support of family practice residencies. In1976,specific authority to supportfamily practice andprimary care internalmedicine andpediatrics training was granted, plus a requirement that medical schools achieve a certain percentage of \"primary care\" training positions intheir affected residencies. Atthesame time The Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) was created to analyze national data and make recommendations regarding further support and future policies in medical education. 1 S3 0 178 A short five years later, GMENAC has delivered its report, concluding thatthe shortage of absolute numbers of physicians isover,andthata surplus may be present in1990.This Committee also projectes that thenumber of primary care physicians - family physicians, primary care internists and pediatricians would be at about the proper level by 1990.However, this report was based on an assumption that the current numberof training programs in these primary care specialties would be present throughout the decade of the 1980's. Thereisgood reason to believe that thiswillnot be the case unless continued support is available for these programs.At this moment, these programs are hot-house plants, unable to stand the rigors of the world in an unprotected state. It is my firm opinion that unless protected, many will fail, and that we will not achieve either the numbers of primary care physicians needed in1990, or the even geographicdispersal of physicians, which we need so badly to provide a degree of evenness of access to medical care throughout our nation.There are a number of questions to be asked at this point, but the main issues are: 1)is the hot-house plant worth saving? and 21 can the plant survive after a longer period of protected existence? These are important questions, because Ido not believe that the U.S. public, and particularlythe U.S. taxpayers are in a mood to support a program which is a frill rather thana necessity; nor are they willing to support something which must beforever supported, without hope of independent survival. Iwould like to spend my time in speaking to these two questions.To leap to the bottom line, Ibelieve that the plant is worth saving, andIbelieve thatit can survive in the hard, cruel world after a bit of toughening, and when the climate becomes a bit more moderate. 184 179 First, why can't it survive now? The current insurance based fee-for-service payment system places a very high value on the performance of technicalservices,such asasurgical procedure, a highly technical diagnostic examination, or a laboratory test. The backbone of a primary care practice is the provision of counseling, the eduction of the patient, and the prevention of illness through these processes. These activities, under most insurance plans, are not covered at all. Whey they are covered, the payments allowed are often insufficient to fully cover the cost of providing these services.Thus the primary care physician is at a competitive disadvantage when compared to other physicians.A seasoned, experienced primary care physician survives by providing these services in a highly efficient, tight office practice that builds on prior knowledge of the patient, and is able to use its time maximally. The teaching environment, in which such physicians are trained, cannot approach this level of efficiency. Young, learning physicians are slow, and they often require one-to-one teaching. As a result, no more than 1/3 to 1/2 of the operating costs of the model teaching clinics associated with such programs can be covered by patient-charges.Why can't the financial gap in such programs by supported by the hospitals of which they are a part, or by the medical schools which sponsor them?Primary care programs are a particul_ ly difficult problem for the hospital, because they tend to keep patients out of the hospital, rather than to utilize the hospital's facilities and services.In a time when the hospital is attempting to cope with rapidly rising costs, and to keep its ter diem costs toa minimum, adding the cost of these training programs to the 185 180 bills of hospitalized patients is not a popular solution. Hospital trusteesare often willing to see the family practice residency go, in order to foregoan increase in the per diem bed charge.Primary care programs in general, and family medicine programs inparticular have not always been welcomed in medical schools. These programsare not understood by highly specialized and subspecialized faculties. Forthe most part,it was the demand of the public through their governmentalrepresentatives, that has enabled these programs to be established. Federaland State initiatives, by providing special funding to these programs, haveallowed them to be established and to survive in a sometimes hostileenvironment. Medical schools, like hospitals, are having a hard time in keeping costsdown while also absorbing the withdrawal of capitation funds and tightenedresearch awards. GMENAC has created the impression that the manpower problemshave been solved, and many medical faculties, when faced with the necessityof picking up costs which have been previously been borne by a Family Medicinetraining grant or aPrimary Care Pediatrics Training grant, will now bewilling tosee such programs disappear rather than to see other programstighten their belts even further. In addition, the withdrawal of Federal funds for family medicine/primarycare training, while funds for research through the NIH are preserved, givesdeans and tradltional medical school faculty the wrong message: that thegeographic and specialty distribution of physicians is no longer important,and that medical school priorities can revert back to the 1960 emphasis onresearch, high technology, and super-subspecialization. 181 Are these programs worth saving? My own answer is a resounding \"YES!\", andIbelieve thatthegreat majority of the public would agree. These programs areproducing products which provide cost effective, reasonablypriced medical services which are readily accessible, and more evenly dispersed than could otherwise be provided. Experience of the past indicates thatthese physicians cannot and will not be produced unless such special programs arein place.Experience of the past 10 years indicates that the products of these programs have, indeed, provided primary care, and have distributed themselves widely. The evidence from Family Medicine is most impressive.The attrition from the field has been almost non-existent. Half of the graduates have gone to towns of less than 25,000 people. Evidence indicates that they do provide less expensive care.Can these programs ever survive? Again, my answer is \"Yes\", but with a qualification. Ibelieve thatthe currently proposed \"pro-competitive\" health care plans, by providing a mechanism for rewarding cost effectivehealth behavior by physicians, will provide an environment in which primary care can not only survive, but flourish. The current payment system provides great financial rewards to those physicians who do more, especially technicalprocedures, and penalizes those who spend time and effort to prevent illness,and who believe that listening sympathetically can be better than a test or a tranquilizer.Any modification of .necurrentpayment system which will encouragegroups of physicians, insurance companies, HMO's and other entities toprovide highly cost effective care will provide the primary care physician, 18 182 and indirectly, the training programs for producing such physicians with a much stronger and more stable environment for both survival and growth. In addition,it will also promote the effective incorporation of physician's assistants and nurse practitioners into primary care settings.My messageis that, until such time as the procompetitive health care proposals have been considered and (hopefu'iy) passed, it is essential thatfamily medicine and other primary care residency training programs arecarefully nourished and protected. Otherwise they may not survive, and the gains of the past ten years will be lost!Thank you for allowing me to present my views.Mr. GrossmArr. Thank you very much, Dr. Estes.I will follow the p 'tern that we did with the last panel, which isthat I will ask one cSenator Hatch's questions and then when wesend you the transc,..pts from the hearing, there will probably befurther questions from Senator Hatch and other Senators.I will start with Dr. Stemmler. Dr. Stemmler, your testimonyindicates that you have an in-depth knowledge of medical educa-tion and the complex problems which face all of our institutionstraining health professionals. You stated that medical education is\"far more expensive than most other graduate or professional edu-cation programs.\" At the same time, you also recognize the veryreal economic constraints that we are laboring under.Is your organization attempting to examine alternative methodsof medical education which might be successful in training highlycompetent physicians, yet at significantly less costs than our tradi-tional approach?Dr. STEMMLER. You can tell Senator Hatch that we do not havean organized, official study that is now ongoing with respect tomodifications in the cost of medical education. I think, however, itought to be recognized that those questions are continuously beingexplored on an institution-by-institution basis.The point, though, to remember is that although American medi-cal education is extremely expensiveand I emphasize Americanmedical education to distinguish it from education that is conduct-ed in some other countries, which is obviously much less costly interms of actual money; however, in terms of the quality of theindividuals produced, with our costs, we produce the most highlyqualified professionals in the world.We are very concerned that in looking only at cost that we notundermine the quality of physicians that the United States nowproduces.Mr. GROSSMAN. Dr. Bowie, what efforts are being made to seekfunding from private sources for financially distressed institutions?Dr. Bowiz. Let me address that in a very general way and thenmore specifically for Tuskegee Institute.As we tried to point out in our testimony, we recognize theimportance of seeking additional support from non-Federal sources,18& 183and I believe that all of the schools that have been in this programof financial distress have been seeking to undertake the funding oftheir programs from sources other than Federal support.I think it is important for us to point out, however, that the taskforce report of DREW in 1979 pointed out and recognized the factthat there was going to be a rather extended period of time thatwas going to berequired for these schools to come out from underthe financial constraints under which they had historically beenopIthinkrating.that with that in mind, there is some recognition, as Ireview the draft of the legislation, to suggest that at least a mini-mum of 5 years may wellbe needed for these institutions to get inplace those pthat are required in order to find the fundingthat is essentito offset the Federal support.I think that if you look at the institutions themselves and thereports that have been coming each year in regard to the way inwhich they seek to identify and recognize and provide the othersupport that is required other than Federal, I think you will thatthere are several approaches. Each institution, I believe, has a planof its own.With respect to Tuskegee, we have embarked upon a $20 millionfundraising drive for the institution. I think it is important for meto point out at this stage that President Reagan, I believe, in someof his comments has clearly recognized the importance of thehistorically black colleges. I think it is significant to note thatPresident Reagan had committed himself to coming to Tuskegee onApril 12 to be the speaker for our centennial activities. In light ofwhat has happened, I am pleased to say that that recognition ofthe importance of these institutions is being carried out by VicePresident Bush.So, I think there is ample evidence to suggest that there isrecognition on the part of this administration of the importance ofthese institutions.We think it is important for Congress to continue to work withthese institutions that have had a very long and sustained problem.We recognize that it is important for us to deal with this problem;we are working at thisproblem. We believe that it can be resolvedin a partnership relationship. We think that the final answer isFederal support, or some support for these institutions for someextended period of time.Mr. GROSSMAN. Thank you.Dr. Estes, the intent of the initial heals; manpower legislationwas that the FederalGovernment would provide seed money tofacilitate establishment of training programs in family medicineand primary care in internal medicine and pe4Astrics. After almosta decade of support, youhave indicated that these programs arenot yet mature or indeed even capable of financial independence.How can we wean these programs from Federal support?Dr. EErrzs. First of all, I would like to say for the record that theestablishment of these programs could not have been accomplishedwithout the Federal support in the past. So, I think all of usassociated with these programs are grateful for that.Changes in the medical manpower system require aat deal oftime. Remember that it takes 7 years to get a product through, and18J 184the sustinence of the program requires support at all levels withinthe medical center.All of us in medical schools are aware of the fact that thestudent is taught and learns from all levels beyond him. It isnecessary that all levels of faculty be acquainted with family medi-cine and primary-care internal medicine and what it can do. It is not time for this infiltration of information to be complete in our faculty at this moment. It will require another increment of 5 to 10years, in my estimation, for this to occur.In 1978, I was the chairman of an IOM committee that looked at primary care, and one of the conclusions of this group was that primary care would never achieve equity until there was some solution to the payment problem. That payment problem, I think,is paramount and is necessary for the weaning of these programs and any other primary carelike programs. They are not able to sustain themselves under a system that is competitively at theirdisadvantage. This is why I stated that I personally favor theprocompetitive systems that are now being proposed, because thesewill encourage groups to put together cost effective programs that will be able to compete competitively in the world that is out there. I think that is going to be necessary to wean themthe differencein the payment system.Mr. GROSSMAN. Thank you.I want to thank all the witnesses on this panel.Dr. Stemmler?Dr. STEMMLER. Well, could I make a final comment?Mr. GROSSMAN. Yes.Dr. STEMMLER. I want to disassociate myself for the momentfrom the Association of American Medical Colleges and from my own institution and speak only as a private citizen who is veryinterested in the right of access by the public to their electedrepresentatives.I think that the hearing just ending has been a disservice to thatprocess, due to the absence of the Senators. I feel very badly aboutdoing so, but I think it needs to be said.Thank you, Mr. Grossman.Mr. GROSSMAN. Thank you.At this point I order printed all statements of those who couldnot attend and other pertinent material submitted for the record.(The material referred to follows:] 185 STATEMENT BY SENATOR DANIEL K. INOUYE IN SUPPORT OF CONTINUATIONOF THE NURSE TRAINING ACT TO COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES,Wednesday, April 8, 1981 Mr. ChairmanI am most pleased that your Committee is today giving suchexpeditious attention to the reauthorization of the Nurse TrainingAct.In my judgment, as a nation. we have for a long time now, beenfacing a serious nursing shortage, but we have been extremely short-sighted in our unwillingness to develop creative solutions. Theprimary reason behind our reluctance has been our inability, orperhaps our purposeful hesitancy, to make necessary fundamentalmodifications in our current health care delivery system.We have always acted as if nurses will always be willing tobe treated as if they were second-class citizens, rather than truehealth professionals. We have passed laws assuming that they didnot mind having others take the glory and monetary remunerationfor their services. In short, we have not bee:. willing to accordthem true professional dignity and recognition. I wonder if thefact that 98 percent are females is not significant in this regard.There can be no question that our earlier efforts to date havedrastically failed and that no matter how many dollars we continueto spend. the constant turnover of qualified professional nurseswill continued unabated. In fact, just last year. in the State ofHawaii, a joint Hospital-Nursing Association Task Force estimatedthat it cost my constituents over $7 million each year merely toreplace those nurses in our hospital system who have retired $7million not to train their replacements, but merely to orient them 191 186 Statement by Senator Daniel K. InouyePage Two to their new jobs, pay off retirement benefits, etc. Clearly thisis an absolute waste of much-needed health care funds by anyone's standards.Today, I woult. just like to highlight one type of p:ogrammaticinitiative that I sincerely hope will be contained in your finalproposal.First, there must be s clear and firm commitment forAdvanced Training programs. Our nation's certified nurse- midwivesand certified psychiatric nurse practitioners in particular, havelong and honorable tradition of providing high quality care. Fromall the evidence that I have soen, the quality of their servicesare second to none, and nurse-midwives in particular, are actuallypreferred by many American woven to their medical colleagues Accord-ingly, I sincerely that your Committee recommendations will giveOur Appropri...:...= Committee sufficient flexibility so that we mightactually increase our commitment to Advanced Training programs duringthe next fiscal year. In this regard, I would also hope that youwould give every consideration to directing the Health Care FinancingAdministration (HCFA) to provide our nation's nursing schools withsufficient resources to develop model \"Teaching Nursing Homes\". ina manner compatible with that of the traditional Teaching HoepitalNursing home care currently accounts for nearly 8 4 percent of ourhealth care expenditures and is considered by HCFA to be the mostrapidly growing category of health re expenditures Yet.i haveseen no evidence that we really hex ny long-term strategy to addressthis growihg problem. In all sincecy. I ask who better than our 192 18'1 S.Jcement by Senator Daniel K InouyePage Three nation's nursing schools have the type of expertise necessaryto adequately develop high quality teaching programs for thissegment of our population? In this light.I also feel that highpriority should be given to providing Nursing Schools withSpecial Project support. For example,I have recently becomequite aware of the truly unique stresses that military nursessuch as those who served in Vietnam, continue to experience.Unfortunately, it would appear that this population has also beenlargely overlooked by the medically-oriented rehabilitationprograms, in this case those of the Veterans Administration.Once again, Ifeel that it is our nation's schools of nursingthat are in the position to truly address these needs, if onlywe would provide them with sufficient f! Lancia' resources Insummary,I honestly feel that our nursing programs possess thepotential for truly revolutionizing our present health tateprogram, if we would only stop thinking of health care as solelythe provinceof doctors and realize that there are many otherprofessional disciplines involved.If we are truly committed to providing high quality healthcare to our nation's citizens, and especially to those who aretraditionally underserved, such as the elderly and our youth, thenwe must make a firm commitment to increase, and not cut back, onour commitment to our nation's nursing schools. 83-520 0-81-- 13 188 Implications of the Projected Doctor \"Surplus\":Summary of Importaht Findings fromFour Recent Studies Jack RodgersMarch 13, 1981Revised:March 27, 1981 U.S. Department of Health and Human ServicesPublic Health Service Health Resources AdministrationBureau of Health ProfessionsDHPA Report No. 81-17 19 4 189 Introduction The number of active physicians in the United States ts expected to increaseby roughly 150,000 or 36 percent during the pe-iod 1979-1980. During the sameperiod, physician density will increase from 185.1 to 277.3 physicians per100,000 population (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1980a). Theimplications of this expanded supply of physicians for the access to healthcare, for the geographic distribution of general practitioners and for healthcare costs were the subjects of four recent studies conducted by the Divisionof Health Professions Analysis (OHPA). The purpose of this report is to present summaries of these two contract andtwo in-house studies supported by DHPA. The summaries were taken from reportswritten by the principal researchers. All four studies and their implicationsfor the U.S. health care sector are being integrated in a forthcomingpublication (u.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1981). The first summary presents results from a study by Professor James 8. Ramseyof New York university, entitled \"A Re-Evaluation of Supply and DemandConcepts in Physician Care\" (Contract No. HRA 232-79-0068). Ramsey attemptsto replicate the findings from four past studies of physician behavior, three of which gave rise to various \"supplier - induced- demand\" concepts. Each dataset was subjected to a battery of sophisticated specification error testswhich are designed to test for reliability of econometric models. Ramsey conclwes mat none of the studies support the \"supplier - induced- demand\" theory.. stead, the results support the orthodox demand- supply model. 195 190 - 2 - The second study summarized is a study by Or. Donald R. House, ResourcesResearch Corporation, entitles \"The Study of the effect of Physician Supply on the Supply, Mix and Cost of Health Services\" (Contract No. HRA 232-79-0101). House demonstrates that the \"supplier - induced- demand\" model which he terms the\"demand creation\" model rests on a relatively weak theoretical foundation. If the demand creation model is formally specified, its empirical predictions are indistinguishable from those of the orthodox demand - supply model. Therefore, the demand- supply model is adequate for forecasting the effects of an increasing stock of physicians. The third summary presents results from an in-house study oy Or. L. JacksonBrown am, Jack Rei0 entitle0 \"Are the Manpower markets for General ?ractitioners working? Implications of New Evidence for Geographic Distribution\" (000A Report No. 81-13). Brown and Seici's research results ShOw tnat market forces are allocating general practitioners across counties They conclude that the typical market for GP's is in Oisequalibrium, and new GP'sare being distribute0 into markets as a result of cemand shifts. One important implication of their researcn is that the placement of NationalHealth Service Corps physicians in local markets is a destabilizing factor in these markets. The final summary presents forecasts from an in-house study by Dr. JackRodgers entitle0 \"Long-Run Forecasts of Physician and Hospital Prices ana Expenditures\" (OHPA Report No. 81-5). Rodgers uses an orthodox demand-supply moael to forecast health care prices and expenditures. The model forecasts that increases in the supply of physicians curing 1975-1990 ',ill eventuallylean to a decline in the real price of physician services and an increase in the orice of hospital services. 196 191 A RE-aAlliATIOf! OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONCEPTS ItPHYSICIAN CARE 'intract No. MRA 232-79-0068)lew York UnivPrstty, Professor James B. RamseyProject Director Summary A reliable model is one which is explicitly derivedfrom a well-tested theory which in turn is known to be relevantto the situation in question. The simplifications needed toproduce an estimable model should be relevant, useful, cndstable over the estimating, forecast, or policy period. The data used toestimate the coefficient values and to produce hypothesis tests must closely measure those values which the theory indicates are of interest or are contained in the model's structure. Valid statistical procedures must be used and the residuals should be tested fully for the detection of non-randomness. The outcome of such a process is a reliable model and one for which one can trust the theoretically assigned probability levels. Clearly, no model is perfectly reliable and the policy-maker can have degrees of confidence in the results. Modest levels of some aspects of unreliability can be translated into modified probability statements, but more serious levels of unreliability imply that little in the way of useful policy implications can be drawn.Indeed, one can easily be in a situation wherein no reliance at all can be placed in the empirical results. This paper explores the reliability of four studies of the market for physicians' services. The area has been a center of controversy in recent years, with several researchers contending that the market 197 192 behaves most unusually, and that supri:ing policy measiires are thereforeto be recommended, in particular, that the supply of physicians shouldbe restricted in order to reduce price. Our work explores the analytical and particularly the statisticalreliability of work by Feldstein (1970), Fuchs and Kramer (1972),Brown and Lapan (1972), and Hixson (1979)Their data and estimatesare sub)ected to a battery of tests designed to discover non-randomness anddependence in the residuals. The detailed analysis of all the alternativestudies and data sets is not completeso that a final overall evaluationof these models is not yet possible. Nevertheless, a reasonably clearpicture of the empirical situation is beginning to emerge from theanalysis. iirst, given the detailed analysis concerning the definition andmeasurement of the variables involved, the outcomes of the specificationerror tests and the tests for serial independence, the various experimentsrun and the sensitivity analysis, it is clear that all the models are to someextent or another misspecified. tis further clear that the models proposedto date are inadequate to explain the observed data. More specifically, it is clear that the apparent high level of auto-correlation of the residuals must be analyzed and removed before anyconfidence can be had in any of the models. The observed serial patterns saymerely be due to a complex auto-regressive structure in the disturbance terms.What is more likely is that the net effect of a series of modelmisopecifications is producing the apparent result. For a very simpleexample, consider that an important variable has been omitted from theregression and that its time series structure is a complex auto-regressiveone or even a moving average process. The omission of such a variable, 193 especially if not easily approximated in tz.ar of powers of the conditional mean of the dependent variable, would produce the test results observed in the Feldstein equations.Secondly, the removal of the serial independence if inherent in thedisturbance terms could well lead to significant and highly informativeresults from the specification error tests oace the serial independence is removed.Considerable attention was paid to the definition and measurement of theconstituent variables, and the Ortho tests indicate a further reason for care, considerable evidence of high levels of nearsingularity. One immediate implication is that great care must be taken in measuring the variable values and in choosing approximate algorithms for evaluating the data.The presence of near singularity and inappropriate algorithms may mask the presence of otherwise valuable information. It is already clear that modest alterations in the set of observations used to obtain estimates, orstraight forward, but justified, modifications of the variables can have adramatic impact on the values, significance, and even signs of the coefficients.In no manner of speaking can one claim that even a moderately reliable model has been obtal-td.The unreliability of the models including the associated statisticalassumptions, coupled with a dubious set of variables, means that at the moment no useful theoretical conclusions can be drawn. The basic simplecompetitive market model has not yet been rejected by the analysis; there are too litany concommitant and substantial sources of error to contend with for one to be able to reach such a conclusion. 194 Further, one can say even less about the implications of these resultsfor more complete and more sophisticated versions of economic theory which, apriori at least, appear to be more relevant than the current naive formulations.What is abundantly clear is that the physician services market is not asyet understood and there are no reliable models, although Hixson's model mayprovide a suitable base for developing an improved analytic structure. What has also been learnt is the urgent requirement for better data more carefully measured.Some disaggregation by submarkets is obviously required as well.Policy guidance is inappropriate from our results, except to emphasizemost strongly that in a situation of great uncertainty, extreme care must betaken in advocating new policy, particularly counterintuitive policy. The uncertainty of one's information and its inherent risks need to be incorporated in evaluating policy options. At the moment, tie overall weight of evidence and received theory wouldindicate that the odds are in favor of a traditional market in physician services.To put the matter otherwise, once a reliable model has beengenerated the odds are in favor of that model being consistent withconventional theory.If the conventional theory is right an increase in longrun physiciansupply will benefit all consumers, but in particular those now receivingmarginal care, e.g., small towns and villages in the country. A decrease will harm all consumers, but especially the marginal consumers, audconsumption items, for example, preventive health care for children. 2 195 However, if SOON form of the supplyinduced-demand theory were to be correct an increase in supply would increase medical care only slightly, but would raise prices. A decrease in physician supply would lower care, but would lover prices as well; at least to it is claimed. Because the theoretical development of the supplyinduced demand hypothesis is incomplete, the above \"beneficial\" predictions are hazardous, but are the best results from the consumer's viewpoint claimed by its proponents for an as yet undemonstrated situation.Consequently, even if the odds were even between received theory and the supplyinduced demand hypothesis, one must concude that the optimal policy is still to encourage the supply of physicians, or at least take a neutral stance. At greater than even odds for received theory, then consumers can be expected to be overwhelmingly better off by encouraging physician supply, not discouraging it. 201 106 THE STUD1 OF THE EFFECT OF PHYSICIANSUPPLY ON THE SUPPLY, MIXAND COST OF HEALTH SERVICES (Contract No. HRA 232-79-0101) Resources Research CorporationDr. Donald R.

At stukt in this controversy is the healthmanpotter policy aimed at controlling costs.Most are aware of the Fedcral government's continuing attempts toLontnin he .1th care ecKts.

Demand creation had its beginnings as aserious explanation of physician behavior in 1970 and has evolved through u smallnumber of contributors. And since the Congress must consider health manpowerlegvilution, it is ru cessary to determine what promise the dcmnnd creationapproach affords. This economics literature as ttc only substantive materialoffering demure] creation analysis of the medical market. As an alternativetheory with some legitimacy, the Bureau of Health Professions must considei II rpossible use of demand creation in foremaing the impact of the growing stock ofphysicians upon the future medical market. This research, therefore, mustevaluate the demand creation model and issue recommendations to the Ilurcau ofHealth Professions regarding the advisability of adopting the (I( n n,ci creationmodel as a forecasting tool.

The Bureau of Health Professions'forecasting model and its underlying premises are reviewed in the context of existing supportfor the demand creation approach and the 1990 responses to the futurephsleian stock are considered. Results hind RecommendationsThe demand creation model is incomplete for two reasons. First, it is based on a relatively weakfoundation. Second, the model itself is not closed, i.e., additional relations must be specified for the model to yield predictions concerning physician behavior. The completed version of the model makes predictions stitch are generally indistinguishable fiom the orthodox demand-supply model. The exception is that in predictions of the impact of a growing physician stock upon fees, the c'ernavdcreation model is consistent with either increases or decreases in fees when the stock of physicians increase. Surprisingly, the demand creation models acre d vfloped is an explanation ofthe empirical positive relation bctw,..cn physiciandensity and fees but as we have shown, these models are consistent with anyempirical fact. In adchten, when asked to consider other equally important evidence, the models become troublesome and inaccurate. The demand creation model when completed cannot explain any emp.rical facts not explained by en expanded demand supply model.

L. Jackson Brown and Jack Reid Summary Are market forces allocating general practitioners geographically? Theevidence generated from this study indicates the answer is yes. This summarywill briefly review that evidence and identify those conclusions that can andthose that can not be drawn from the evidence. The approach that this study used to address the research question is asfollows:First, equations representing causal (structural) models of medicalservices markets in equilibrium and different types of disequlibriun weredeveloped.Next, these models were solved for their reduced-form, Finally,this set of reduced -form equations was further analyzed to derive theempirical patterns one would expect to see under circumstances of equilibriumand disequilibrium. This led to a series of p,- .diction concerning the sizeand sign of certain regression coefficients and the behavior of the errorterms under conditions of correct specification and of misspecification of thereduced-form equations. These predictions follow logically from the originalstructural models and allow the construction of hypotheses that discriminateempirically between markets in equilibrium and markets in disequilibrium. 2 6 201 Four separate hypotheses emerged from the analysis. One described the pattern of empirical events that would occur if markets were in equilibrium and no other misspecifications were embedded in the model. Another described the pattern if markets were in disequilibrium and the model was otherwise correctly specified. A third and fourth, described the empirical patternsexpected it misspecifications other than equilibrium/disequilibrium conditions were committed. To test these hypotheses, the number of GP's in all non-SMSA counties in the United States was analyzed using linear regression. The empirical results of that analysis overwhemlingly contradicted the predictions of all but thehypothesis of disequilibrium. Thus, the hypothesis of equilibrium and the two on other forms of misspecification can be rejected in favor of the hypothesis that markets for GP's are in long-run disequilibrium and that they areadjusting to market forces engendered by exogenous changes in demand. The study was then extended to an analysis of the market behavior exhibited by three different types of counties: Those designated by the Federal Government as physician shortage counties and staffed with a physician under the NationalHealth Service Corps program; Those counties so designated but not staffed;And those counties not designated as shortage counties. Events had created the conditions of a quasi-experiment. Each group of counties was analyzed with data from 1975, before NHSC physicians had been placed. Then each was re-analyzed with 1978 data after NHSC placements had occurred in the one group. 27 202 The results of the analysis for two groups of counties, those not designatedand those designated but not staffed, were very similar to previous results.They were in disequilibrium adjusting at about the same speed found in theoverall analysis. Moreover, their behavior did not change much between 1975and 1978 indicating that no structural change in causal forces had occurred inthe interim. This was not the case for the counties that had been both designated asshortage areas and staffed with NHSC physicians. In contrast to othercounties, these counties were not showing market adjustment activity in 1975. Instead they were essentially static indicating they were in long-runequilibrium at a time other counties were losing GP's. Out, when thesecounties were examined with 1978 data a marked change was observed. At thattime, they were in disequilibrium showing the most rapid adjustment of anygroup of counties studied. Thus, the results indicate the two groups of counties in which intervention did not occur were very similar to one another in their market behavior andalso very similar to the behavior of all non-SMSA counties. In addition theyshowed no structural change over the time period. In contrast, the countiesthat had experienced intervention between 1975 and 1978 were dissimilar to theother markets in their behavior before the intervention (i.e., they were inequilibrium while the others were not) and experienced marked structuralchange afterwards (i.e., they were then in disequilibrium and adjust4rgrapidly).The placement of NHSC physicians was the only apparent change thataffected these groups of markets differentially. 208 203 What conclusions can be drawn from all of this? First, these results offer strong evidence that market forces are allocating general practitioners across counties.The final estimating equation and the empirical patterns predicted were derived from an original structural model in which supply is endogenously respond,ng to exogenous demand shifts. Not only can it be determined that the markets for general practitioners are functioning, their speed of adjustment can be estimated since the coefficient that indicates that speed is derived from an original structural with that same interpretation. The fact that other types of physicians or the quantity of medical services were not observed arguesfarcare in drawing inferences, but it JOeSnot invalidate the conclusions thus far drawn. Even if other types of physicians are substituting for geniral practitioners, the fact remains that GP's are flowing into and out of counties and a market disequilibrium model rationalizes that flow. What can not be said is whether the net quantity of medical services or the total number of physicians in a market are increasing or decreasing. That would require arguing past the evidence. Second, the results offer strong evidence that the placement of NHSC physicians in a market is retarding the replacement by market forces of general practitioners subsequently lost to the market area. This follows from the fact thatanendogenously adjusting supply in the presence of exogenous demand shiftsis not sufficient to explain the structural change that occurred in that group of markets after NHSC physicians were placed there. Instead, one must argue that it is the exogenous shift in supply due to the placements 83-520 0-81--I4209 204 that is driving the system by throwing those markets into a condition ofexcess supply. Market forces are attempting to reduce that excess byretarding the market replacement of GP's leaving. Those who would quarrelwith the market explanation are left to come up with a consistent and explicitalternative.Along that line it doesn't seem reasonable to argue that adisjunctive leap in the trends in demand has occurred for some mysteriousreason in only one set of markets. Here again, with this conclusion, care must be taken not to argue past thedata.All physicians were not observed, therefore, one cannot argue thattotal physician manpower has decreased (or increased for that matter), muchless the quantity of medical services delivered.But one can argue thatwhatever the total manpower is, it is less than it would have been if marketforces were not retarding replacements, and that should placements cease thethe tendency would be to return to the appropriate long-run equilibriumassociated with existing demand conditions. 205 LDNG-RUN FDRECASTS DF PHYSICIAN ANDHOSPITAL PRICES AND EXPENDITURES(DHPA Report No. 81-5) Dr. Jack Rodgers This study reports the use of an econometric model to forecast health care prices and expenditures. The model represents the current status of research conducted in the Bureau of Health Professions for several years. The object of this research is to develop a capability to forecast national health careprices and expenditures in each of the major service categoriesdental, physician, hospital, pharmacy, and long-term care. Forecasts of dental prices and expenditures have been reported elsewhere (Hisxon, 198D; Hixson and Mocniak, 1980). The specification of an econanetric model of physician and hospital services has also been documented previously (Hixson, 1979). The empirical basis of this Bureau of Health Professions econanetric model is aset of national time series data for the years 1949-75 which is based on standard series reported and updated annually in the Statistical Abstract of the United States and other common sources. Forecasts from the econometric model are presented in Table 1. Each forecasted value is indexed to the base year 1975 to facilitate comparison of changes over the forecast period. The real price of physician services is forecast to fall by 7.7 percent between 1975 and 1990 while the real hospital price level rises 20.3 percent during the same period. Partially because of these price changes, the quantity of physician services rises by 52.8 percent while the quantity of hospital services rises only 34.4 percent. 21' 206 Since cost containment is currently an important national policy goal, totaland per captia expenditures on health care services are of great interest.The model forecasts a 41.0 percent increase in expenditures on physicianservices (which is 23.7 percent on a per capita basis) and a 61.7 percentincrease in expenditures on hospital services (which is 41.8 percent on a percapita basis). The forecasts from the model described in this paper reflect the effects ofincreases in both resources and regulations. As a result of increased medicalschool enrollments, the stock of physicians will increase through 1990 andbeyond.During the recent past and into the foreseeable future, growth inbeds and other hospital assets will be controlled by Certificate of Need andother devices.The result is downward pressure on prices in the physicianservices sector with continued increases in hospital prices. The forces onhospital demand will include increased population, increased income, andfalling real prices for physician services. The model can be used to show how changes in the number of physicians andhospital beds will affect long-run developments and the price quantities ofphysician and hospital services. The comparative statics of a four-equation,two-market system are somewhat more complicated than that for the singlemarket with two equations.For instance, a decrease in the number ofphysicians will increase the price of physician services in the single marketwith no interaction.In the four-equation model, a decrease in price forphysician services decreases the demand for hospital services thus puttingdownward pressure on the price for hospital services. 21 2 207 Table 2 shows how changes in the numbers of physicians and hospital bedsaffect the 1990 equilibrium real prices and quantities. A 10 percent,eduction in 1990 stock of physicians (shown as Alternative 1 in Table 2) willincrease the 1990 price of physicians to 95.9 compared with the baseline(Table 1) forecast of 92.3.A 10 percent reduction in the 1990 stock ofphysicians decreases the hospital price below the forecast in Table 1 (111.4capared with 120.3).As might be expected the quantity of physician servicesdeclines.However, the quantity of hospital services also shows a declinerelative to the baseline forecasts. An increase in the number of hospital beds (shown as Alternative 2 in Table 2)causes the real price of hospital services to fall relative to 1975 andrelative to the baseline 1990 forecasts. The 1990 real physician oricesincrease slightly above those in Table 1. Quantities of both physicians andhospital services increase relative to the baseline forecasts. At present the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC)is recommending a reduction in enrollments at medical colleges (U.S.Department of Health and Hunan Services, 1980b). The result of such a policychange would be higher prices for physician services than will be the case ifenrollments continue along present trends. On the other hand, the modelpredicts that. a smaller stock of physicians will reduce the demand forhospital se-vices. 203 208 Caution must be exercised in interpreting the results of a time serieseconometric model based on so few observations. The forecasts and comparativestatic results presented above should be viewed as only rough indicators ofcertain forces at work in the health care industry. For instance, since themodel includes only one measure of hospital physical capital, beds areprobably a proxy for total physical assets. Thus, the model should beinterpreted as indicating how changes in hospital capital will affectmovements in equilibrium real prices and quantities. Also, the model is toohighly aggregated to show how changes in the complicated regulatoryenvironment will affect future outcomes. For example, supply responses toprice changes may be prevented by certificate-of-need requirements or othergovernmental controls. These weaknesses notwithstanding, the forecasts indicate that strong forcesare at work in the health care market place which result from the increasingnumber of physicians and controls on investment in physical capital. 214 209 Table 1FORECASTS OF NATIONAL HEALTH 1:1990 stock of physicians is ten percentbelow 1990 Table 1 values.

The Association ofAmerican Veter_iary Medical Colleges includes in its membership the twenty-five schools and colleges of veterinary medicine currently in operation andtwo developing colleges.S. 799 proposes significant departures from the current national healthprofessions education policy. We have two major areas of concern we wishto express. One et.nee;n, our first priority, is for the students, their abilitiesto finance their education, and the prospects of only those of very significantfinancial means having access to 4, veterinary medical career. Secondly, weare concerned that the elimination of institutional support mechanisms willresult in poorer quality educational programs and reduction in enrollment,i.e., reduced educational opportunities for students.In the past few decades, startling changes have occurred in the veterinarymedical profession.While the original and most obvious service the deliveryof direct health care to animals and the relationship of that service to foodsupplies and the nation's economy remains a basic and vital function, it isbut one part of a larger responsibility. Thousands of veterinarians work forgovernmental agencies at all levels, helping to implement regulations designedto assure that only safe, wholesome animal products are marketed for humanconsumption.Others are involved in public health matters such as controllingand preventing the direct hazards to human health from transmissible animaldiseases and the dangers arising from toxins and environmental pollutants.Comparative medicine, that area of study that deals with the interfacebetween animal and human medicine, demands the skills and attention ofinvestigators trained in schools of veterinary medicine. If those on the front 22 0 215 lines of veterinary medical activity are to have the knowledge and tools toperform effectively, research in the laboratories and in the field must berelentless, and it must be pursued by highly trained professionals.Veterinary medicine is a biomedical science of such breadth that itsmembers are now among those best-equipped to deal effectively with thecomplex interrelationships among human beings, animals, and the environment.If society is to continue to benefit from advances in veterinary medicine,there must be no lapse in the quality of those trained to pursue it. Currentlyabout 8,150 students are enrolled in twenty-five colleges and schools ofveterinary medicine in the United States. About 1,950 new veterinarians willbe graduated this year.Clearly, any significant reduction in the quality oftraining would impair a vital national resource. Nevertheless, sevcral factorsare threatening to do just that, foremost among them the financial squeeze.The cost of veterinary medical education ranks among the highest inthe health professions, far beyond the amount that can be recovered fromtuition and other usual sources of college income. Twenty-one of the veter-inary medical colleges are in state universities, and these states cannot beexpected to continue to finbnce the major part of the nation's costs forveterinary medical education. Like schools devoted to training physicians,veterinary medical colleges maintain a high ratio of faculty to students,particularly in the clinical aspects of training, veterinary schools face highcosts in recruiting and maintaining high quality faculties, they must provideexpensive laboratories and equipment for teaching the full range of biomedicalsciences, and they must provide those vital arenas of instruction, modernteaching hospitals.Unlike their counterparts in human medicine, those responsible fortraining veterinarians must prepare their students to deal with complex 22.1. 216 health problems of not one but many species. They must do this withoutaccess to some major sources of income available to medical schools. Mostsignificant for animal health care,, there are no third-party payer systemsavailable to owners of animals requiring medical care. This results inseverely limiting the service income of veterinary medical teaching hospitals.Income in such hospitals rarely provides more than half the needed support.With costs of veterinary medical education approaching $20,000 per yearper student, itwould be folly to presume that the students can carry themajor part of the financial burden of their education. While physicians areoften seen as able to command high incomes and therefore repay largeeducational debts, the situation for veterinarians is quite different. Startingsalaries average about $18,500.In most respects, we believe, the previous health manpower laws havebeen effective in achieving the national priorities in veterinary medicaleducation.Capitation grants have provided funds which could be used toimprove the quality of educational programs. The declining level of capitationgrant funds in recent years has resulted in many losses which reflect immedi-ately on educational quality, and they include reduced purchases of librarybooks and other autotutorial resources, reduced employment of technicians toaid the faculty, and, in some cases, reductions in faculty numbers. Webelieve the decisions to terminate institutional support will continue toreduce the quality of education unless alternate sources of such funding aredeveloped.The limited financial resources of the states make it Improbablethat many of them will be in a position to provide increased financing forveterinary medical education. This leaves the burden largely with thestudents, so student financial aid will become even more important for thefuture. 222 217 Capitation grants have also helped provide access to veterinary educationto students from all states, although veterinary schools exist in only 24states.One likely result of the elimination of capitation grants will bereduced educational opportunities for students from states without veterinaryschools.This will probably contribute to geographic maldistribution, particularlyin large-animal medicine.Current public concern over levels of state spendinginhibits sufficient expansion of state appropriations for veterinary medicaleducation.To attempt to close the income-cost gap by further limiting theenrollment of out-of-state students would be tempting but shortsighted.Because of the geographic locations of the institutions, many states would beunderserved, and entire regions of the country would be shortchanged.Please consider the following recommendations for amendments to S. 799:We are pleased to see that S. 799 proposes to continue the institutionalfinancial distress grants.Without this source of funds in recent years theSchool of Veterinary Medicine at Tuskegee Institute could not have continuedas an accredited veterinary medical college. That school serves a uniquerole in veterinary medical education and contributes through its distinguishedfaculty in many significant ways to the advancement of veterinary medicine.It must have this source of financial assistance until it can complete currentlyplanned operational, managerial and financial reforms. We recommend changesin S. 799 in accord with the April 8 testimony of Dean Walter Bowie tomake this program a continuing effective means of assistance to TuskegeeInstitute and other health professions schools in similar circumstances.Continuation of the Health Professions Student Loan Program is extremelyimportant to veterinary medical students since it provides a major source forthem of moderate Interest rate loans. We are pleased to see that S. 799proposes to extend the HPSL progran however, we believe it is essential 223 218 that S. 799 provide for continuing appropriations so that students in existingand developing schools may rely on this source of loan support. Withoutcontinuing appropriation authority, access to IIPSL loans will be available toonly a very few students, probably only those who have borrowed from thissource in the past.Unless loans are available from this source, students willbe forced to seek high interest rate Health Education Assistance Loans,which is an unsatisfactory alternative. New graduates with massive highinterest rate loans to repay will be forced to select the highest-paying pbc.Economic factors will prevent them from taking jobs in which service maybe more essential or continuing their education for service in currentlyundersupplied specialities.Notions we hear regarding reducing studentfinancial aid programs simply do not, In our opinion, recognize the realitiesof current costs of health professions education. The Health ProfessionsStudent Loan program, with provisions for loan forgiveness for specifiedprofessional service, and The Guaranteed Student Loan program have been ofmajor assistance to veterinary medical students. We believe that theseprograms must be continued and expanded, especially in view of the diminishedinstitutional support and the increases in the students' share of educationalcosts.Extension of the scholarships for students of exceptional financial needis a vital action to help assure that students from low income backgroundsmay prepare for a health profession. While few veterinary students have hadthe benefit of such scholarships, we believe the program will be even moreessential in the future, and we recommend its extension and the extension ofsuch scholarships through the second year of professional education.We hope that the Congress will continue to recognize the increasingnecessity of federal financial aid for health professions students. In view of 224 219 the diminishing institutional support, adequate resurces for student assistancemust be available or the health professions will soon be restricted to onlythe very wealthy.Veterinarians trained as specialists in biomedical research, livestockproduction research, pharmaceutical product development, and veterinarymedical education are scarce. the numbers are too limited now for theexisting demands, and economic pressures on institutions and students indicatethat this situation will continue unless action is taken now to provide incen-tives and resources for post-doctoral education. Veterinary pathologists andtoxicologists and laboratory animal veterinarians are currently needed insignificantly greater numbers than are available.The General Accounting Office reported on March 30, 1979, that it hadfound inits review of the National Cancer Institute's carcinogenesis programthat a major factor causing failures in the program was \"... a shortage oftoxicologists and veterinary pathologists .. ..\" This is only one illustrationof an extensive problem which is not improving. The National Academy ofSciences is currently studying this matter with the intent of documenting thenature of these health manpower supply problems. Large debts to be repaidafter graduation from veterinary medical colleges discourage or prohibit newgraduates from continuing their education unless appropriate stipends areavailable.The veterinary medical colleges cannot provide the post-doctoraleducation opportunities without additional funding for that purpose. Werecommend that a new special project program be authorized to providethrough grants or contracts the necessary funds to expand post-doctoraleducation in several veterinary medical specialties.Last year we made recommendations which we thought were appropriateregarding federal sharing in the cost of health professions education and 83-520 0-81--15225 220 specifically veterinary medical education. Our problems of operating qualityprograms in veterinary medical education continue as do the problems of our students.Another year has passed, and the sources of financial support forour programs and our students have become more uncertain while the costscontinue to climb.Demands for veterinary services, escalating costs ofeducating veterinarians, and severe limitations on sources of income forveterinary medical schools have put these vital programs in jeopardy.We appreciate this opportunity to comment on S. 799. 226, 221 Health Professions Educational Assistance and Nursing Training_Act of 1981 S. 799 Statement of: The Association of University Programsin Health Administration April 9, 1981 Gary L. Filerman, Ph. D.President 202/659-4354 2 9'''.., 222 Health Administration Training. Health administration graduate training involves a two year masters degree.Accredited programs may be located in a variety of schools, including medicine,business, public health, or graduate schools, all offering equivalent degrees.The curriculum includes the study of health institutions, medical care practices,health economics, management skills, and behavioral sciences. The programs provide important services to the health service deliverysystem.In addition to attracting, training, and placing needed managementtalent, health administration programs: - Provide management consultation to all kinds of health services. - Teach health service organisations and health economics to studentsin other health professions. - Do research on management problems and policy issues. - Advise state legislatures and other agencies on health care policy. - Provide a significant portion of all continuing education opportunities designed to strengthen the competence of practicinghealth seriices administrators. There are accredited programs in forty universities. Twelve are in schoolsof public health and twenty-eight in other settings, including one operated bythe U. S. Army. 228 223 The Weed There is an acute shortage of trained health administrators in many kinds of delivery organisations. Only large general hospitals have adequate professional management.The greatest needs are in rural hospitals, HMO's, home-health agencies,group practices, community health centers, and state and local government agencies. - Program graduates have many job offers. - Starting salaries average almost $20,000, reflecting the high demand. - There are career long opportunities for every graduate - less than 5% of all graduates have left the field. - The most professionally oriented nursing hone administrators belong to theAmerican College of Nursing Home Administrators, but only 35% of theirmembers are college graduates and only 10% have health administration training. - There are 5,000 home health agencies. A 1975 AUPHA study showed that 90% of their administrators had no administrative background. - In 1979, 27.3% of the members of the Hospital Financial ManagementAssociation lacked a bachelor's degrees. Only 14.6% were trained at the master's level. In 1979, for the first time, half of the graduates did not go to general hospitals.As a direct result of federal support for expanded enrollment,production was sufficient to begin to direct some graduates into the managerially underserved sectors of the system. 22u 224 The many executives of health delivery organisations who lack profest.onaltraining need the continuing education and technical assistance provided by the programs.Continuing education also focuses on maintaining the skillet ofprogram graduates and is particularly important to assure effective ssssss wentand use of new managerial and health technology State agencies are major clients of health administration programs. Theprograms provide id-career training of individuals who move from clinical andtechnical roles into administration. If the states assume greater responsibilityfor federal programs through block grants, the programs will be asked to producenew staff for them, up-grade the competence of current program managers andprovide direct consultation on program planning, maaagement and evaluation.Because many states lack health administration programs, number are functioningas regional resources. Federal Support The increased demands of all kinds on health administration programs resultin large part from federal initiatives. Agencies whi:h administer Medicaid andMedicare require program graduates and services. PA the key factor is that federal funds, controls and accountability have g fatly increased the complexityof managing all health services, creating the high demand for appropriatelytrained managers in even the smallest unit. In fact, the small units lack thetechnical skills to back up the general administrator, so they spend large sumsfor outside backup. 23 0 225 Until 1977, only programs in school, of public health had any consistent federal support - and that was as part of the school.In 1977. the Congress, with bipartisan and administration support. enacted Senator Schweiker's amendment which provided modest support to the programs outside of public health schools. The law recognised a clear federal resPoneibility to improve the Management of organisations which expend billions of federal dollars to IM011eNnt Metal health programs. Under the block grant prow**. the need will continue - it will grow to the extent of management development needs in state agencies. because the programs are smelt and in the process of developing the capacity to meet the nation's neeJs, only a modest amount of support can be used effectively. There is an acute shortage of appropriate faculty.Direct federal support for programs outside of public health schools was, therefore. limited to $5.000.000, which was divided between $314 to increase the capacity of the programs and $2M to support training of experienced health workers. Non- public health programs had to met criteria which reflected the nation's needs' - Quality - the program must be accredited - growth - enrollment must increase - critical male - minimum of 2S graduates - non-federal support - non-federal support of $100,000 must be assured, in effect, creating a Retching effort in which the federal grant gradually decreases as the number of eligible Programs increase 231 226 This approach proved very successful, beginning development of nationalsystem of health management training centers. Won-federal support increased,enrollment expanded, there has been a mocked increase in continuing educationofferings and other managerial backup to the system. P.7,1 S.7117 would dismantle this expended effort and do it precipitiously.While other health professions have been anticipating an and to institutionalsupport, health administration and public health have repeatedly been assuredof their continuing national priority. S. 733 assumes, incorrectly, that all health professions (except nursing)are oversupplied. If S. 711 is passed: - The number of health administration graduates will drop at least 20%, virtually assuring that all will go to the large g 1 hospitalswhich offer the best salaries. - Nid-career training - such of it for state age3cies - will end. Onlytraineeships make mid-career training possible. - Non - federal matching funds will be reduced. The inducement to saintaincurrent levels will be gone. - Continuing education, a low university priority, but a high health administration and public health priority, will be the first activity to go. 232 227 Some health agencies, IHO's, long-term care, and rural services will be the hardest hit. - Administration efforts to reduce vests, fraud, mismanagement, and Owe will be undermined. The bill authorised SS million for public health and health administration, all in project grants - only $4 million of which is earmarked for schools of public health and graduate programs in health administration. This authorisation does no* provide the maintainenoe of effort necessary to **et the stated objectives of the Administration - it is, in fact, one million less than the 1912 budget. USarifttn first Priority: The bill be increased to 1135 million, $12 million to be allocated to loans to health studentc o her than medicine and nursing. The other students are for practical purposes excluded from the student aid programs in the bill as introduced. Three million dollars to be authorised for health administration capacity development grants, contingent upon non-federal funds of $150,000 (up from $100,000 at present) the first year, $175,000 the second year, and $200,000 the third year. The $5 million in the bill would be allocated entirely to public health. 233 228 Seared Priority, Increase the public health and health administration authority to 66 millionas in the President's budget for the first year, increasing the authority to $7,000,000 in 1,63 and $11.0 million in 11164.

The remarkswhich follow are also endorsed by the American College of PreventiveMedicine, the professional society for preventive medicine physiciansand a sister organization.The Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine is a smallacademic society composed of some 600 individual members who arelargely medical faculty and some 60 medical school departments ofpreventive medicine. The Association has as its overriding goalthe advancement of prevention as a component of health professionseducation.It is widely recognized that we are rapidly approaching whatcould be termed a crisis situation in the health care field. Although.as stated recently by the Surgeon General, the health of the Americanpeople has never been better, our nation's annual health care billhas skyrocketed to a level unthought of just years ago. Thiscondition cannot go unchecked -- with that all can agree. However,,questions and disagreements as to how we, as a nation, are to addressthis problem will continue to abound as we attempt to grapple with this very complex issue.In our view, long-term control of health care costs will only be achieved by integration of prevention within the health care system.Our current model of health care is in reality the science of diagnosis and treatment. As a result, the system itself is a model of \"crisis management,\" intervening after the fact withcostly remedies rather than acting to anticipate and avoid the occurrence of ill health and disease. Under such a model, solutions 23 282 to contain costs can only have short-term impact because they donot cut to the core of the problem with our health care system.The adage of \"an ounce of prevention\" is indeed true, yet we haveconsistently failed, in any meaningful way, to integrate preventioninto our health care policies and programs.If a change is to be affected in our health care system tointegrate the science of prevention, we must first impact upon theknowledge and attitudes of the individqals who run that system --health professionals, particularly physicians. Unfortunately,today's average practicing physician has little or no comprehensionof the potential role of preventive medicine in the practice ofmedicine.Frequently patients are more knowledgeable in thisarea than are their physicians. Yet there exists a body of knowledgewhich, if properly taught, could have a measurable impact onphysicans' skills and hence, the health of their patients. And herewe speak of health in terms of health maintenance and the avoidanceof costly disease, rather than treatment of it after the fact. Inthe aggregate, the implications for cost savings are potzntiallyenormous.Prevention, though a small field, is dynamic in itsconcepts and goals. Preventive medicine is the branch ofmedicine that is primarly concerned with preventing physical,mental and emotional disease and injury, in contrast totreating the sick and injured. The paramount goal of thisarea of specialization is to promote and preserve individualhealth status. Additionally, it is concerned with thewell-being of the community, and the efficient and effectivemanagement of scarce resources. - 2 - 238 233 The distinct body of knowledge known as preventive medicinecan be traced at least to 1913, when the first edition of RosenausPreventive ledicine and Hygiene was published. Since that time the body of knowledge has been extended and its focus hasshifted in response to changing patterns in the incidence of di .For instance, early in this century, preventive medi- cine was concerned primarily with communicable diseases, whiletoday one major focus is on chronic conditions such as respiratory and heart di ,while another is health maintenance andenhancement.Training and practice in preventive medicine build upon a diverse, multi-disciplined base. The \"core\" sciences of preventivemedicine include epidemiology, biostatistics, environmentalhealth, nutrition, clinical preventive medicine, the behavioralsciences, management and health care systems analysis.Preventive medicine practitioners are engaged in teaching, research, administration, end the delivery of personal health services.Teachers are responsible for instilling an awareness and knowledge of prevention in all medical students, through curriculumdeveloped and taught by departments of preventive and community medicine, or through integrated curriculum in other clinical fields.Non-physician public health personnel are also trained by preventive medicin e specialists within both medical and public health school settings.Researchers in the field are engaged in a wide array ofactivities, ranging from the study of risk factors and distribution of disease (epidemiology) to the design and evaluation of progr:.:+s to promote health and prevent disease. Physicianadministrators occupy key positions in public and private settings, such ag state and local health departments, and health maintenaccc- 3 - 234 organizations, where they are responsible for planning andimplementing personal and community health services. Finally,practitioners deliver a variety of prevention services in thecommunity setting, be it the workplace, school, or locality.In 1979 Healthy People: The Surgeon General's Report onHealth Promotion and Disease Prevention called for a second public healthrevolution in the United States. In conducting such a campaign,the importance of prevention and the role of the physician specialistin preventive medicine cannot be overstated. While the incidenceof chronic diseases is on the rise, a growing body of knowledgemust now be translated into practice. Apart from tremendous returnsin human productivity and cost savings, an investment in preventionpromises the potential of avoidance of needless human suffering.PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND MEDICAL EDUCATIONOur present model of medical education in the United Stateswas largely shaped by a famous report, which included the followingamong its observations:..The practitioner deals with factsof tuo categories. Chemistry, physics,biology enable him to apprehend one set,he needs a different perspective and appre-ciative apparatus to deal with the other,subtle elements. Specific preparationis in this direction much more difficult;one must rely for the requisite insightand sympathy on a varied and enlargingcultural experience Such enlargement of -4 - 24Q 235 the physican's horizon is otherwise important,for scientific progress has greatly modifiedhis ethical responsibility. His relation wasformerly to his patient - at most to hispatient's family;, and it was almost altogetherremedial.The patient had something thematter with him:, the doctor was called in tocure it.Payment of a fee ended thetransaction.But the physician's functionis fast becoming social and preventive,rather than individual and curative.Upon him society relies to ascertain,and through measures essentially educational toenforce, the conditions that preventdisease and make Positively for _physicaland moral well-being (emphasis added)...1 To the intelligent and conscientious physician,a typhoid patient is not only a case, buta warninghis office is equally to heal2the sick and to protect the well...\"That was written in 1910, in the \"Flexner Report' onMedical Education in the United States and Canada, a report which otherwiserevolutioned the course of medical education, (in most respects.)Fifteen years later, in a retrospective study of the 1910report, Abraham Flexner wrote the following'\"Curiously enough, despite the increasingimportance of preventive medicine, consequent - 5 - 83-520 0-81-162 4 1 236 upon the advance of bacteriology and theclearer knowledge of the futility or limi-ttions of many therapeutic measures, hygienecontinues to occupy decidedly subordinateposition in the undergraduate curriculum:,and even incidental treatment of the pre-ventive aspects of di ,though increasingly3common, is still far from general.\"In 1932 a Commission on Medical Education of the Associationof American Medical Colleges (AAMC) made the following observation:,\"Medical education should emphasize tostudents the influences of urbanization,industrialization, and present dayconditions of living which are importantin the causation, treatment, and preventionof disease...it is important that thephysician be acquainted with the social,economic, and other environmental factorswhich have an influence on the individual4and his health.\"In 1945, a Committee of the AAMC, formed to investigatethe teaching of prerestive medicine and public health in medicalschools, again found ,uvere shortcomings in this area. Amongother things, the report examined tiro importance of a distinctdepartment of preventive medicine, as well as the necessityof increasing the proportion of medical school curriculumsdevoted to prevention. Committee recommendations, which wereapproved by the AAMC Executive Committee, included:, 242- 6 - 287 \"1.That the objective in each medicalschool be to provide a separate departmentof preventive medicine and public healthand that for purposes of evaluatingthe organization for teaching preventivemedicine and public health in any givenschool, the combination of preventivemedicine and public health with some otherdepartment be regarded as unsatisfactoryafter July 1, 1948... 2.That there be set aside for the teachingschedule of the department of preventivemedicine and public health, four percentof the total hours available in the curriculumof undergraduate medical education, and thatafter July 1, 1948, any medical schoolproviding loss that this amount be considereddeficient in this regard... S.That the various departments of themedical school in their respective fields,strive for the greatest practicable contri-bution in teaching the preventive aspectsof disease; that in the highest degree possible,the teaching of preventive medicine and oublichealth be integrated with clinical teaching, - 7- 243 288 and that the greater part of theinstructional staff in the departmentof preventive medicine and public health5 be given hospital and clinic appointments.\"In more recent years, both medical school curriculumand residency training in preventive medicine have been thesubject of a number of studies. In 1975, n task force onEducation and Training of Health Manpower for Prevention(National Conference on Preventive Medicine) found evidenceof insufficient training of prevention within medical schoolsas well as shortages of specialty trained practitioners isthe field.The task force recommended that federal healthmanpower legislation be enacted which would a) encouragea preventive emphasis on the basic curricula for health per-sonnel b)provide career development support for trainingof teachers of prevention, and c) .encourage projects tointegrate prevention in programs to train primary health carepersonnel.In 1978 these recommendations was confirmed by anInstitute of Medicine report entitled A ganoower Policy forPrimary Health Care. The report found that \"...insufficientattention has been devoted to teaching and research inbehavioral and social sciences, to the coordination andcontinuing of health care, and to clinical experience in - 8 - 244 239 outpatient settings.\" It therefore recommended that\"Undergraduate elucation shouldprovide students with a knowledge ofepidemiology and areects of behavioraland social sciences rele%ant tr patientcare.\"s Last year the first Surgeon General's Report on HealthPromotion and Disease Prevention was issued. In additionto proposing a strategy for the integration of preventionwithin our health care system, it discussed at length themanpower implications of such a strategy. Again, evidenceof future shortages in the field of preventive medicineass cited, as well as an insufficient emphasis on preventionin the training of physicians.In December 1979, the Department of Health, Education, andWelfare submitted a report to Congress on community and public healthpersonnel.Among other things, this report contained the followingsecommondation for action by the Federal government:\"Encourage and support the developmentof capabilities to provide training inhealth promotion, disease prevention, andother public health content in thecurriculum of schools of medicine.osteopathy, dentistry. optometry. pharmacy.podiatry, veterinary medicine, and inschools offering preparation in the allied7 health programs.\" - 9 - 2 1 5 240 Clearly there has been long-standidi consensus thatour health care eystem, particularly the educational system,should place greater emphasis on prevention. This consensus,however, is in stark contrast to current realities:Of the nation's 128 medical schools,at last count only 88 have departmentsof preventive medicine or its equivalent.A number of these are today threatenedwith closure due to shrinking budgets.Others have already been forced to closedown since the last count was made. Federal support for genetic specialprojects in preventive medicine withinmedical schools has dropped precioitiously,from $1.1 million in FY 79 to zero inFY SO. It has been estimated that less than LSof the total undergraduate medical curriculumis devoted to prevention, in contrast tothe 4\u00b0. recommended above by the AA%C. Of the 41 active accredited residencyprograms in preventive medicine, mosthave only a few funded positions 241 available.For 1980-81, the mean was 6.6funded positions per program. Although it has been estimated that 3,600public health and general preventive medicinespecialists will be needed in 1990 to meed demand,at the current rate at which they are beinggraduated from residency training programs, only2,800 will be available in that year. Federal support for residency traininghas also declined in recent years. ffhereasin 1973 $1.2 million was committed forthis purpose, in 1978 and 1979 thatlevel of support dropped to approximately$100,000.In FY 1980 approximately$275,000 was made available for this purpose. Although preventive medicine needs have been repeatedlystressed they have seldom been met. The reasons are obviouslycomplex.Chief among these has been the minimal committmentof financial resources within medical schools to departmentsof preventive medicine. Without these resources, existingdepartments, even where they do exist. are unable to developthe faculty, and hence the curriculum, for long-term imnactupon medical student education tithout that impact, ue areunable to recruit new physicians into the field. further 2 d4 242 exacerbating faculty development.then medical students do express an interest in specializingin preventive medicine after graduation, they are faced withuncertain and fluctuating prospects for support during theirresidency training years. Many residency program directorsresort to turning away prospective residents because the re-sources simply do not exist to support them. Governmentstipend support is particularly important for the preventivemedicine resident because stipends cannot be provided out ofpatient care revenues as with other \"bedded\" specialties.An extra year of post-MD academic training is required forboard certification. Preventive medicine residents are nothospital based during the remainder of their training, thusprcgra'n directors cannot offset training expenses by providingservices for remuneration. Finally, after graduation preventivemedicine specialists generally occupy positions in the publichealth sector at salary levels which are much less lucrativethan private practice, making reoayment of educational loansmuch more onerous.The current state of affairs has therefore led toextreme shortages in many preventive medicine areas. Inaddition to impacting on the delivery of public health programsand prevention research, this has obviously had an impacton the status of prevention within the medical school curriculum,thereby completing a vicious cycle Without tne reouired 2 I 8 243 manpower pool, advancement will be impossible. Certainly if ourhealth care system in to place greater emehasis on prevention, achange must be effected in the attitudes and behavior of medicalstudents and physicians. Federal manpower policy must foster anintegration of prevention principles within manpower education.The commitment must be made now to develop the necessary manpowerbase to carry out this mission.In light of the foregoing, we are deeply disturbed that S 799contains no provision for the support of either medical schooldepartments or residency traini.g in preventive medicine. Enactmentof legislation without provision for training in pre:entlon would,in fact, exacerbate the current situation since the authorities forexisting support, under P.L. 94-484 although meager, would beeliminated entirely. At a point in tire when prevention is beingspoken of as the hope of the futurr in terms of health care costcontainment, such an aura of events would translate to a severediminution in the visibility of prevention within the medicalschool curriculum.We are pleased that the Administration has recommended $3 millionin new funding in this area for 1982, and would urge that S. 799 heamended to include specific program support for both departmentsand residency training in preventive medicine.Confronting, as we do, a future of diminished resourceswhich must be allocated among competing demands, it is importantthat we invest wisely with an eye to future returns. As health carecosts have skyrocketed in recent years, alternative forms of costcontainment have been examined. None offers more promise thanprevention.Clerly, if the goal of our health care system is to - 13 - 244 assure optimal health at minimal cost, disease prevention holds animportant key. S. 799 will, therefore, be amended to provide theIopportunity to unlock and apply knowledge which from as tar back as1910 has been generally recognized as being vital to our nation'shealth and well-being.

SENATE COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES ONNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS AMENDMENTS The American Medical Student Association is a National organization of22.000 allopathic and osteopathic medical students at over 130 schools through-out the United States. We are a completely independent organization committednot only to representing our members. but also to advocating better health carefor all Americans. We appreciate this opportunity to submit testimony on 5.801.and thereby share the results of our members.Various provisions of 5.801 are of major concern to ANSA.We feel that S.801 not only will impact on the availability of financialassistance to medical students from disadvantaged backgrounds, but more nnportantly,will substantially decrease the Health Manpower sources for millions of Aokariransrescuing in medically underserved areas.Our specific areas of concern regarding 5.201 are: 1.)geographic population and institutional criteria usedin designation of Health Manpower shortage areasZ.)continunity of communication between federal and local healthagencies regarding evaluation of health manpower needs withiniealth 'Aanpower Shortage Areas3.)Elimination of National Health Service Corps scholarships4:Expansion of the Independent Practice Option for National HealthService Corps scholarship recipients 252 247 Entities Eligible for Designation es HMSA'sA major concern of our organization is the change that 5.801 would effectregarding the designation of Health Manpower Shortage Areas (HMSA's). Thecurrent language of H.R. 7203 states the definition of a HMSA as \"(A) an areain an urban or rural area (which need not conform to the geographic boundariesof a political subdivision and which is a rational area for the delivery ofhealth cor7icoc) thede :on-Ines has a health manpower shortage,(B) a population group which the Secretary determines has such a shortage. or(C) a public or nonprofit private medical facility or other public facilitywhich the Secretary determines has such a shortage.\" We believe that thedeletionof Sections (B) and (C), as proposed in 5.801, would be an errorwhich would lead to much greater level of imprecision in designation of HMSAs. As of December 31, 1980. 1921 sites had been designated as HMSAs. 1790were geographically-based. 33 were population-based, and 48 were institdtionally-based.Designations of population groups included the elderly, imigrant workers.Hispanic and Indochinese refugees. American Indian groups (outside areas tradi-tionally served by tne Indian 4ealth Service), and hedically indigent sub-popula-tions (with income averages less than 200' of poverty level).Designations that were institutionally-based included state prisons. publicinpatient psychiatric facilities. institutions for the mentally retarded. andambulatory care services witnin tertiary care institutionsElimination of population and institutional criteria for HMSA designationswill 14air the Secretary's ability to evaluate the true medical needs of aCommunity[t will ignore such inherent factors of population subgroups as theirinability to support physicians in a traditional fee-for-service scheme, culturaland languape differences between the population and fee-for-service physiciansal0 practice among other population groups in the sant geographic area. andspecific medical needs of a population that would not be addressed by privatesectar c,'nysiciariS due groups lack of economic power This Committee hasnear p.evious testi-ony, sally from Orc. Soliciting Input From Local OrganizationsThe concern we have regarding the elimination of population andinstitution-based criteria for HMSA designation is far greater than expressedthus far, however. It has logically been argued until this time that suchpopulation groups would have adequate representation and participation inthe processes that could culminate in designation as a HMSA.The mechanismsfor their roprosentation and participation have been the local HealthSystems Agency (HSA) and the State Health Planning and Development Agency(SHPDA).It concerns us that the language of S.801 specifically excludespassages from Section 332 of the Public Health Service Act that provide forthese avenues of local response: \"The Secretary shall take into considerationthe following:\"Sec.332(c)(1)(A) Tho recommendations of each health systemsagency... (B)The recommendations of the State Health Planningand Development Agency.... (2)The recommendations of theGovernor of each State in which the area, population group,medical facility, or other public facility under considerationfor designation is in whole or part located.\"The Administration's current plan to eliminate the HSAs and SHPDAsdoes not provide an alternative mechanism for local or regional input,into thedesignation of HMSAs. It seems quite paradoxical to this organization thatthe stated philosophy of the Administration is decentralization of governmentalresponsibility for provision of medical services in an effort to make suchsystems more responsive, when the changes of language proposed )n S.801 woulddo exactly the opposite. The changes would eliminate the mechanisms throughwhich local governments may express their unique needs for financial, tech-nical, and manpower support. In addition, specific changes involving thedeletion of Sec. 332 (g) would eliminate individual recommendations to theSecretary for designation of an area, population, or institution as a HMSA.Although the Administration seems to indicate that HSAs and SHPDAs areyet another instance of the federal government superimposing control on analready adequate state network, this is in many, if not most cases, a miscon-ception.In fact, information provided to Rep. Henry Taxman's staff regardingHR 7203 of the 96th Congress, demonstrated that in 1979, the federal governmentand HSA agreed on whether or not a RMSA classification was appropriate in86t of all cases considered. In 12\" of the cases, the federal governmentdisapproved of establishment of a HMSA, while the NSA approved. In only 2-of the cases did the federal government approve designation of a HMSA opposing 254 249 the recommendation of the HSA. Thus, with regard to designation of specificgeographic, population, or institutionally-based groups as HMSAs, an unusuallyhigh level of accord was achieved between federal and local agencies.In1979, 641 out of 700 requests for HMSA designation were approved, 463 of whichoriginated within the HSAs and 21 of wnich originated within SHPDAs. Sinceit is these agencies which present and reflect local needs and management ofhealth care facilities within their jurisdiction, we find it surprising thatthe Administration seeks their elimination. This effort is particularlyconfusing in light of the fact that only a minority of states have integratedsuch agencies within their Departments of Health. Two examples of such programsare found in California and Pennsylvania. Some states have cooperative healthstatistics programs to assess current health care needs and predict futuredemand.Many states, however, will be left without a mechanism specificallydesigned to assess and initiate the implementation of changes in health care delivery. 255 250 National Health Service Corps Scholarship ProarewThe American Medical Student Association (AMSA) wishes to reaffirm itssupport for the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program. Wehave ardently voiced this position since the 1960s, even before the officialestablishment of the NHSC by the Emergency Health Personnel Act Amendmentsof 1972, Public Law 92-585.Despite increases in the total supply of health professionals in theUnited States, a severe maldistribution of health manpower was perceivednationwide.In 1975 this prompted Dr. Malcolm Todd, then president of theAmerican Medical Association, to state before the House Committee on Interstateand Foreign Commerce that, \"Unless we can come up with acceptable incentivesfor rural and inner-city practice, were going to have the same (distribution)problem in 1980 that we do now.\"The NHSC Scholarship Program was seen them, as it must pe today, as themajor attempt by the federal goveenment to target physician manpower tothose rural and inner-city area feeling the manpower shortage most acutely.Contrary to the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee(GEMENAC) report, the Carter Administration, in testimony before this committeein the 96th Congress, estimated that by 1990, over 16,000 additional physiciansand mid-level professionals will be required to provide service in medicallyunderserved communities and institutions: 7500 in rural areas, over 5000 ininner-cities, and over 3,500 in prisons and mental institutions. TheAdministration's intent to eliminate Corps scholarships for fiscal year 1982does not reflect the unmitigating nature of the economic forces that havePrevented fee-for-service physicians from establishing practices in sucnunderserved areas.AMSA recognizes various economic factors which have largely determinedthe geographic distribution patterns of physicians and other health personnelin the past.These have included expected levels of eimbursement and incomeand the economic ability of patients to utilize local medical facilities, madepossible to a large extent by third-party payments Other factors havefrequently been mentioned as influencing practice location, including area ofbirth or previous residence, the locale of one's medical education, and socialand cultural characteristics of the community in which establishment of apractice is considered. 256 251 These factors will continue to play a role in determining the geographicdistribution of physicians in the future. However, their significance willbe minimized by the economic realities that physicians who have incurred sub-stantial debt will face. Our organization's testimony on another bill currentlybefore this Committee, 5.799, provides an excellent perspective on thoseeconomic realities.Based on current Treasury Bill rates, the physician entering oracticesubsequent to a three-year postgraduate course would have to repay 525,265on a principal of S4,000, borrowed in annual increments of $1,000. Between1968 and 1978, the average amount of student debt rose from 53,050 to 510,450,an increase of nearly 250 percent. Subsequent data provided by the Associationof American Medical Colleges indicated that in 1978 and 1979, the number ofgraduating physicians having incurred debt increased to 76 percent of thetotal.The average level of that indebtedness of graduating students increasedsimultaneously to $15,800 in 1979. Needless to say, these trends haveseriously concerned our organization as well as medical school administratorsand faculty.AMSA's concerns regarding the changes made by provisions in 5.801center on its impact on the service aspect of the NHSC. A second issue ofgreat concern, intricately tied to the first, is the effect that this billwill have on the future composition of medical school classes.AMSA's testimony on 5.799 provides statistical documentation of thecurrently declining enrollment of minority groups as a percentage of the total.The NHSC Scholarship Program has specifically sought to correct this problem.Between academic years 1973-74 and 1977-78, a significant share of the 4,566new scholarships awarded were provided to members of underrepresented groups.While Black students comprised only 6.1 percent of total medical schoolstudents. 19.5 percent of NHSC scholarship recipients were black. Whileonly 2.7 percent of medical students were of Hispanic origin,. Hispanicstudents represented 3.9 percent of scholarship recipients. While AmericanIndians totalled only 0.3 percent of all medical students, fully 1.2 percentof NHSC scholarship recipients ere American Indians.A major study done by the American Association of Medical Colleges(RAMC) found that 78.8t of black medical students are interested in a shortage-area practice versus only 45.6\" of Wilte students. The proportion of black 83-520 0 81 -- 17257 252 medical school graduates who eventually establish practices in underserved areashas been variously estimated at 50-75%. By eliminating the National HealthService Corps scholarship porgram, 5.801 would discourage minority students fromattending medical school when those students are the most likely to maintainpractices in shortage areas. Scholarship for First-Year Students of Exceptional Financial Need (EFN)Through EFN, medical education has hocomp a reality for many students fromseverely limited financial backgrounds. Under this program, scholarships areavailable to full-time students of medicine and other health professions.These scholarships cover all reasonable educational expenses, includinga stipend of 5485 per month.In fiscal year 1981, 700 EFN scholarships were awarded to students ofexceptional financial need, a majority of whom are from groups that areunder-represented both in medical practice and in medical schools. This is alimited program, however, and only provides for first-year scholarships. The700 EFN students who received scholarships for the current academic yearwere designated as priority candidates for National Health Service Corpsscholarships provided in fiscal year 1982. Since maintenance of good academicstanding at the institution in which the EFN recipient matriculated was thesole criterion for this priority classification, the elimination of new NHSCscholarship awards appears to violate a contractual obligation between theSecretary and the students Many EFN recipients specifically chose to attendmedical school based on the availability of these funds, and did not anticipatethat they would be furced to incur substant.al debts for their medical educa-tion.Since the recipients are from lower socio-economic backgrounds,requiring them to incur such debts precludes the possibility of their returningto an underserved area, which most probably could not support a traditionalfee-for-service physician. 258 253 Independent Practice OptionAMSA would like to commend the expansion of the Independent PracticeOption (IPO) as a means of fulfilling the service obligation of scholarshiprecipients.We feel it is essential that scholarship recipients be encour-vzed to practice in HMSAs following fulfillment of the obligatory serviceperiod.It must be noted, however, that the retention rate has greatlyincreased since 1973. A 1978 General Accounting Office report, Progress andProblems in Improving the Availability of Primary Care Providers in UnderservedAreas, noted that the very low retention rate prior to 1976 was largely dueto recruiting policies followed prior to fiscal year 1974. Until that time,the report stated, most Corps physicians had draft obligations, and manyhad not completed their residency training.The provision in 5.801, Sec. 338C, that would provide subsidies forphysicians practicing under the IPO is commended by this organization. Thesliding scale incentive during the four yearS of obligatory service apparentlyis intended to provide the physician with a larger subsidy during the initialstages of independent practice, while decreasing the amount cnnsecutivelyover the service period.We feel that the subsidy levels proposed in Sec. 338C would only providesufficient supplements to the incomes of physicians practicing in Priority 3or 4 HMSAs.These levels, therefore, would establish an inherent economicprejudice against Priority 1 and 2 areas in which the need for placement of aCorps provider is most appreciable. This would also contradict past policyof the 1,115C which emphasized placement of Corps personnel first in Priority1 and 2 areas.We profoundly disagree with the Administration's view thatsimple supply-side conomics will eventually provide 'or adequate distributionof physicians in all communities, regardless of the socio-economic compositionof the individual communities. Despite any future surplus of physicians thatmay occur, the economic realities of independent practice make it far moresuitable for Priority 3 or 4 areas. We must stress that this argument is basedsolely from a hypothetical e,.onomic perspective and does not re'lect any changein our position that most areas which have traditionally been unable to supportfee-for-service physicians w:11 continue to be unable to do so. This isespecial!, t, ,in light of the spiralling costs of both riedical education andhealth cam it*. essential that adequate health care be provided for sv-11 25D 254 areas.AMSA opposes amendments to Section 338 (F) that would provide for theconversion of NHSC scholarship contracts to loan agreements under which therecipient is relieved of any service obligation. Rather, we would ardentlyurge that service contingent loan forgiveness programs be provided for phys-icians entering into independent practices in health manpower shortageartas, as designated under Section 332. Attempts to make rates of repaymentmore favorable to students, still falls short of eliminating the need forthe physician to generate income within a fee-for-service scheme above alevel necessary for personal support. Similar repayment schemes, concludeda 1975 GAO report, did not have a significant impact on influencing medicalschool graduates to locate in shortage areas. It is our contention that ifttm increased level of indebtedness has stimulated significant interest insuch programs. that Priority I and 2 areas will, once again, be subject toeconomic forces which provide physicians with a greater likelihood of successin less underserved areas.it is our firm belief that the current system of financing medicaleducation requires most individuals to incur dramatically increasing levelsof personal debt. This, in turn, makes it economically impossible for all buta small number of students to consider establishing practices in underservedareas.On behalf of our membership, we would like to express our sincere appre-ciation for this opportunity to submit testimony on 5.801. We look forwardto working with this Committee in providing quality, cost-effective health carefor all Americans. 255 American Academy of Pediatrics Testimony submitted to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources for the Health Professions Educational Assistanceand Nurse Training Act of 1981 S799 Anril8, 1981 Division of Government Liaison1300 North 17thStreetArlington, Virgava 22209703-525-9560 261 256 Hr. Chaitman, this testimony is submitted for inclusion inthe hearing record on the Health Professions EducationalAssistance and Nurse Training Act of 1981 (S. 799), whichproposes to amend Titles VII and VIII of the Public HealthService Act.Policies and recommendations contained hereinare those of the American Academy of Pediatrics, an inter-national professional association whose more than 22,000member physicians are dedicated to the well-being of infants,children and adolescents.That commitment ever in mind, there are thus several aspectsof S.799 which warrant comment, foremost among them:Training Grants. Itis the considered view of the Academythat especially during a period of scarce resources, theprimary care specialties should not receive arbitrarily dis-proportionate fedcral assistance. Nor should general ptdiatricsand general internal medicine be lumped together in theirlanding arrangements. We urge that such impediments in thelegislation at issue he removed. Specifically, we proposethat separate and distinct grants from the Department of Healthand Human Services be made to 1) plan, develop and operateapproved residency training programs in general pediatrics,2) plan, develop and operate teaching programs for medicalstudents in general pediatrics:, and 3) plan, develop andoperate programa for the training of physicians who plan toteach general pediatrics.Total authorizations for the above mentioned tnitiativesshould be set at not less than $15 million during each ofthe next three fiscal years as, in our judgment, that is theminimum sufficient to meet basic maternal and child healthinterests.The relative availability of funds for researchand training in the 1960s promoted the growth of subspeciali-zation.The influence of these subspecialties and of theservice funds associated with them was an important factorin bringing about emphasis on residency training in inpatientsettings at the expense of training in ambulatory care.Traditionally, departments of surgery and medicine, ascompared to departments of pediatrics, have received dispro-portionate levels of hospital and medical school supportbecause of the revenue generated from their hospitalizedpatients.Lover rates of hospitalization and greater volumeof ambulatory care have been contributing factors and makeit very difficult for general pediatric training programs.Turning for a moment to the proposed bill's Student Aasslstanceprovisions, suffice to reiterate established Academy views.Medical students should he limited to an aggregate $80,000in federally insured loans for their education, includingtuition, fees and reasonable living expenses. Interest rates 262 257 should be fair and variable in regard to need. Repayment onprincipal and interest should be deferred during medicalschool and length of residency, service in the armed forces,Peace Corps or National Health Service Corps. Repaymentought to be permitted over 10-15 years and begin 9-12 monthsafter graduation.The Academy also favors partial forgiveness of loan principaland interest in return for minimum of two years service inthe NHSC or in a shortage area 15 percent for one year; 20percent each for second and third year; and 25 percent forthe fourth year. The amount of debt that can be paid inthis fashion is 80 percent of the principal. Of course, incases of death, permanent disahility or the like, the loanshould be totally discharged.With respect to Enrollment Commitments, the Academy applaudsthe provision of this legislation that aims to releaserecipients of grants, loan guarantees and interest subsidies(such as medical schools) from any contractual obligation tofulfill related enrollment increases. It is an effort longoverdue.But there are other efforts equally overdue -- efforts notaddressed in this hill but which must be addressed soon ifthe government is genuinely serious about seeking to deliveradequate, cost-effective health care to all Americans.Clearly today, advances in prevention and control of tradi-tional acute and infectious diseases permit the pediatricianto devote more time and attention to what have been relativelyneglected areas -- chronic disease; the increasing number ofbehavioral problems of childhood and adolescence; and whatwe call biosocial problems -- those health problems sociallyinduced or complicated by social and environmental factors.Because coping with the challenges of modern society willcause an increase in the incidence of biosocial problems,modern pediatric training must be directed more specificallyto the treatment of those problems.The content of experience in biosocial pediatrics shouldinclude normal and abnormal growth and development, basicbehavioral science information, reactions of children ofvarious ages to illness, education for healthy lifestylesand familiarity with th.1 principal literature regarding childdevelopment.Residents should also learn about the nature ofpsychologic and achievement tests, the principal psychologictherapies, the principles of psychopharmacology, and thetechniques of family counseling. They should be familiar 253 258 with the development characteristics of the parent-childinteraction, child care practices and dysfunctions inparenting.Residents should learn to manage such family crises as deathand bereavement, suicide attempts, sexual assault, acci,:ents,child abuse, birth of a defective child, separation, divor,e,abortion, and a wide range of common behavioral disorders.Furthermore, they should be able to work with the family toresolve problems in parenting, well child care, adoption/fostercare, school adjustment, and learning. They should be familiarwith the role of the pediatrician in the management of diseasestates in which psychological elements play an etiologic orcontributory role.There has been also a dramatic increase in our recognition ofchild health problems associated with poverty, a deterioratingphysical environment, changing family structures and othersocial and psychological factors. There is growing evidencethat encouragement of health promotion and changes in life-styles may become more important than medical interventionin affecting morbidity and mortality. The pediatric communityrecognizes that pediatric education must respond to thesechanges in child health needs. We ask Congress to followsuit by authorizing the funds to allow us to develop andmaintain an educational program relevant to those needs.Pediatric programs have, in fact, begun to evidence a shiftin emphasis toward treatment of biosocial disorders througha strengthening of ambulatolz training. But the shift hasbeen slight, and the bulk of pediatric training still takesplace in hospital settings even though the burden of carefor children with such problems remains largely in hecommunity.We simply cannot continue to all but ignore therelationship between biosocial and developmental disorderssuch as early family adjustment difficulties and schoolfailure and adverse health effects of those problems. Arecognition of that relationship mandates pediatric edutaifanwhich emphasizes the processes of human growth and developmentand their relationship to health and disease.Because pediatrics is a primate care disclyline, and becausemost pediatric problems are best handled on an outpatientbasis, pediatric education should utilize the skills anddemonstrate the commitment to personal, continuous carepracticed by the general pediatrician. Thu current pre-ponderance of hospital-based teaching in the pediatriccurriculum is one indication of the dissonance between current 264 259 pediatric education and the health needs of children. Bythe completion of formal postgraduate training, mostpediatricians arc extraordinarily skilled at diagnosing andmanaging illness, especially that of hospitalized children.As a consequence of concentrating pediatric resident educationon illness, many if not most pediatric residents have only arudimentary knowledge of the concept of normality and parti-cularly of the variability surrounding the \"average\" withregard to child development and health status.In the future, pediatricians will be called upon more andmore to manage children with emotional disturbances, learningdisabilities, chronic illnesses and other problems of adevelopmental, psychological and social nature. They willprovide increased amounts of health care to adolescents.They will be expected to manage their practices efficiently,collaborate with other members of the health care team and usecommunity resources to enhance the effectiveness of servicesto children and their families.The ambulatory experience responds to these needs by developingskills in counseling, anticipatory guidance, developmentalappraisal, referral, consultation, use of screening proceduresand practice management. Skills relating to the care ofchildren with chronic illnesses and handicapping conditionsare particularly important. Finally, the ability to coordinateservices, plan comprehensive care and mobilize availablecommunity resources is essential to provide ambulatory careof high quality. To accomplish all this, there remains adistinct need for faculty development and greater suppottfor research related to ambulatory care. Full-time facultymembers in ambulatory _pediatrics need formal training Inthe discipline, it is no longer acceptable to assume thatany pediatrician can teach ambulatory pediatrics.Unfortunately, the pediatric community finds itself in theunenviable position of respond!ng to a dramatic shift ineducational need in an atmosphere of fiscal restraint. More-over, increasingly larger percentages of medical school fundsare being devoted to the delivery of patient care, a develop-ment which we re,ognize is a justified response to the publicdemand for quality health but one which means that othersources of support are necessary if service programs ineducational centers are to improve the teaching environment --particularly through the development of model ambulatory careprograms.An appropriate program of grants for generalpediatric trainiaa_could respond to this need by earmarkingfunds for_the development of ambulatory pediatric models.We 265 260 would reiterate, also, that the Academy does not seek addi- tional pediatric residency positions but, rather, the means to improve the quality of existing residency training andprovide the necessary redirection of content.The need for federal support of ambulatory training programs derives also from the present pattern of reimbursement forpediatric services ...y third party payors. The funds used to support pediatric residencies are pooled from many sources, including Medicaid, other patient-care revenues, stateappropriations and grants. Current reimbursement formulas directly and indirectly detract from the importance ofambulatory care and diminish pediatric department operatingbudgets by imposing restrictions on full reimbursement forambulatory care. Medicaid reimburses well below the actualcost of providing ambulatory care in a teaching setting, andmany private insurance policies do not cover ambulatory care.Sixty-flve percent of families have no insurance coveringoffice visits to a physician. Furthermore, procedure- dominated reimbursement systems tend to discriminate against the provision of preventive services, which constitute a large proportion of good pediatric practice. Simply stated, pediatric residency programs cannot further expand intoambulatory teaching without independent support. Only separate and dedicated federal funding can accomplish thisteaching and training objective.We believe increased financial support channeled into faculty salaries to be the most effective use of increased funding.Current circumstances find medical school faculty commonlyforced to \"earn their keep\" by delivering medical care duringnon-teaching hours. This obviously detracts from teaching time and effectiveness. In the pediatric field, this problemis compounded by the generally longer hours required of practic-ing pediatricians and the above-mentioned disproportionatefinancial stress on pediatric departments. A more substantial federal support program would free pediatricians on medicalschool faculties to do their job, namely, to teach pediatricsto the best of their ability.As the emphasis on teaching ambulatory care increases, pediatricdepartments will ne'd to cope with the serious shortages offaculty to teach in such areas as adolescent medicine, learningdisabilities, care of the chronically ill. ambulatory cart.community prediatrlcs and the behavioral sciences. Faculty development in these areas will require financial supoortfor fellowship, and research positions in these disciplines.This means that pediatric education, which is already costly. .?66 261 will grow even more so if it responds to the obvious healthneeds of our nation's children. In the past we have beenmuch slower to finance ambulatory and preventive care thancatastrophic or tertiary care. However, it is increasinglyclear that economical and effective health care depends muchmore on the former than the latter. We ask you to recognizethis situation in this and future health manpower fundingproposals.Finally, the American Academy of Pediatrics would like tooffer its services to aid in implementing some of thesuggestions made above. 4-21-81 2 6 .7 262alarm esarnerican !OHM0 COOPIO.

HatchChairmanCommittee on Labor and HumanResourcesUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510Dear Senator Hatch:The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) wouldlike to take this opportunity to express its views on 5.801,The National Health Service Corps Amendments of 1981\" andrequests that this statement be entered into the hearing record.The AAMC serves as the national voice for the 126 U.S.accredited medical schools and their students; more than 400 ofthe major teaching hospitals; and over 70 academic and profes-sional societies whose members are deeply engaged in teaching,research and in patient care. As such, the AAMC is an interestedparty in the development of legislation to revise the NationalHealth Service Corps and its feeder mechanism, the ScholarshipProgram.National Health Service Corps (NHSC) ProgramThe AAMC---a longstanding advocate of the NHSC as an effectiveand socially desirable instrument to improve the specialty andgeographic distribution of physicians---has become progressivelymore concerned that the costa of this Program will drain largeamounts of funding from the increasingly scarce resources availablefor other vital programs. There has been a growing convictionthat the NHSC has become an unnecessarily expensive solution tothe maldistribution problems in the Nation. There has also beenconcern that these problems no longer demand efforts as strenouaas in the past. These assertions should not be interpreted tomean that the AAMC believes that the Federal Government has nores,Dnsibility to assist in correcting the maldiatribution ofhealth professionals or indeed that these maldistributions nolonger exist.Rather, it is an expression of the Association'sconcern that the Corps, in its present form, does not appear to be Sun*200/0114 Dupont Circle, N.W /Washington.

HatchApril 22, 1981Page Two the most cost-effective mechanism through which to address theseproblems and that in light of the amelioration of these problems---in part attributable to the NHSC---the magnitude of currentneeds now merits reevaluation. For these reasons, the Associationbelieves that further growth of the Corps should not be permitted.While the Association is pleased that 5.801 provides thatthe Corps be maintained at a steady state, it hopes that membersof the Committee recognize the necessity of reassessing the country'sneeds and exploring less costly means of meeting them. The Associa-tion would suggest that the Committee consider expanding thepopular loan forgiveness provision in the Health Profeasions StudentLoan (HPSL) Program---which has been oversubscribed - - -to allFederal loans. Funding such a program at a modest level wouldprovide the opportunity to test the viability of loan forgivenessin current economic circumstances as a less expensive complementor alternative to the National Health Service Corps Program.Finally, the Association would like to take this opportunityto express its support for the proposals advocated by this bill toencourage use of the Program's Private Practice Option, as onemeans of alleviating the burgeoning costs of the Corps and meetingthe needs of underserved area. Specifically, the Associationendorses those provisions of 5.801 that would:Require the Secretary to provide subsidies forthose individuals who choose this option.Grant the Secretary the authority to negotiatethe conversion of the services obligation ofindividuals electing independent practice into aloan with favorable interest rates and repaymentterms.National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Scholarship ProgramConsonant with the view that the Corps Service Program hasgrown too costly, the AAMC believes that its feeder mechanism,the Scholarship Program, should be scaled down accordingly andtherefore suppo- s the bill's intent to provide only continuingawards.The As Jciation also strongly endorses those provisionsof the bill that would grant the Secretary the discretionaryauthority to convert a student's service obligationinto a 7%loan.The AAMC believes that permitting the Secretary suchflexibility is essential in terms of both the public interest andsound economic policy. 26D 264 Honorable Orrin G. HatchApril 22, 1981Page Three Finally, the Association would like to strongly emphasizethat, although not originally intended as such, the NHSC Scholar- ship Program has proven to be a necessary component of the student aid structure available to medical students. In academic year 1979-1980, 4,401 medical students received approximately $49.8million in aid under this Program---more than half of the fundsappropriated.Thus, it has proven to be a substantial form ofaid and the impact of the loss of these funds must be considered. Therefore, restoration of funds in this amount through some more generous authorizations for other student aid programs is vital tothe continuation of adequate student assistance,If I or members of my staff can supply you with further information, please don't hesitate to contact me. 270John A.

GENERAL COMMENTS The AMA views two factors as being singularly important to assuringthe strength of medical education. First, the instituti ns themselvesmust have sufficient resources to provide education of high quality;and second, the students who wish to pursue careers in health 274 269 -2- professions must have the resources to meet the costs of this education.In order to accomplish these goals, we believe that it in In the best interests of medical schools, the government, the medical profession,and especially patients, that the relationship between government and medicine be as constructive as possible. In the end, our paramount con- cern and goal must be the provision of medical care of high quality. Institutional Support The separate legislation passed in the House and the Senate last yearand S. 799, currently before this Committee, offer aid to health professionsschools through a variety of resources. The AMA strongly endorses the con-cept of having multiple sources for aiding medical schools. In addition tothe aid which has been available through federal programs under the PublicHealth Service Act, state aid to many health professions educational institu-tions, and the support of individuals, foundations, and Industry and businesshave proven to be invaluable. General Institutional support has been an investment of publicfunds that has successfully aided in improving the quality and availabilityof medical education and medical care. The expenditure of these grants has the advantage of allowing the schools to have the flexibility to meettheir Individual needs and the needs of the community they serve. However,the AMA recognizes that even these expenditures must be reviewed in lightof competing priorities for limited resources.Special project grants hnve also proven to be beneficial. In authorizinggrant monies, the government has succeeded In furthering important goals,such as the bolstering of primary medical care in the United States. The 275 270 -3- availability of spacial project grants has benefited those institutionsthat have availed themselves of this source of funds. Funds for aiding Institutions in financial distress and for themodernization of existing facilities have an immeasurable value as a meansof maintaining the quality of medical education. Without resources forthese purposes, the ability of some medical schools to graduate a well prepared class of young physicians would diminish. Such funding should take precedenceover future federal investments in the start-up of new medical schools.However,in supporting assistance for modernization of existing facilitiesand for institutions in financial distress, the AMA recognizes that suchfunds cannot act as a permanent crutch for schools in need of modernizationor in financial distress. In light of the growing trend for elimination of general instituticnal support for medical schools, as exemplified by S. 799, it is our view thatthe medical community and the medical schools must diversify further sorcesof financial support for medical education. While the federal role hasbeen significant in the last decade, medical education has also enjoyedsupport from various other sectors of society. It will now be incumbent toincrease this latter base of support to assist in meeting funding requirements. Student AssistanceThe cost of financing a medical education can only be described asstaggering.Annual tuition figures in excess of $10,000 are becoming common-place, and we are deeply concerned over the financial burdens being placedon students and the impact of high tuition upon new practitioners. 271 -4- The AMA believes that access to medical education must not be allowed to become limited on the basis of income. To prevent this, student assistance must be of the highest priority for government action. Financial aid mustbe available to make the choice of medicine as a career a viable one for qualified applicants. The AMA is committed to seeing that financial resources are available to qualified aspiring health professionals.We believe that an effective and appropriate mechanism for governmentparticipation in medical education is a strengthened program of guaranteed loans.Such a guarantee program would encourage private lenders to makemoney available to students and serve to minimize the strain on government resources.The AMA recommends that repayment of loans under such a program be deferred during the otiriod of medical school training, as well asthrough residency training, when income limitations might pose a hardship In meeting loan obligations. Consideration should also be given to interest subsidies for the length of training, and to setting the rate of repayment tothe ability of the individual to repay the principal of the loan. Loan forgive- ness arrangements, at realistic rates of forgiveness, entered into following completion of medical training when the young physician can better assessthe various available alternatives, could encourage service in areas lacking adequate medical services. This would result In the location of physicians In such areas who are more likely to desire to serve in the area following fulfillment of their payback obligation.While the AMA strongly endorses the guaranteed loan mechanism, webelieve that additional mechanisms can, and should be available to help finance medical education. For example, service arrangements, such as the 272 -5- military scholarship programs and financial grants -in -aid for able buteconomically disadvantaged students should be available. Furthermore,state aid to students in health professions educational Institutions mustbe encouraged. Nurse Training On a daily basis, physicians providing medical care to patients inhospitals are working under a handicap of a shortage of qualified nursing staff.The AMA supports continued federal assistance to programs of basic nursetraining in order to meet the nation's nursing needs. This assistanceshould be provided to both the training institution and to the nursingstudent. National Health Service Corps (MSC) The goal of the Corps should be to place assignees into alegitimate need with the expectation that a long-term commitment for servingthe community will evolve. In this fashion, the MSC should be able tofulfill its function of making medical and other health care available toan underserved population. Accordingly, NHSC service should be undercircumstances approximating and compatible with private practice in thecommunity.The AMA also supports the private practice option where suchservice is consistent and compatible with private practice modes In thecommunity.The field strength of the Corps should not exceed the needsof the shortage criteria.s designated 0-1 and 0-2 under current designation 2 '78 278 SPECIFIC PROVISIONS Data CollectionS. 799 would amend the section of the Public Health Service Act thatauthorizes the Secretary \"to collect, compile, and analyze data on healthprofessions personnel.\" As amended, the Secretary would not be mandatedto establish a uniform health professions data reporting system, and thedata would not center on medical and dental practice. In addition, theSecretary will study the need for and supply of health personnel andprovide \"projections relating to such need and supply In the future.\"The AMA believes that the data collection segment of the existing lawshould be modified, and we therefore endorse the proposal to repealauthority to establish a data reporting system that focuses on physiciansand dentists.However, we are concerned about the possibilities of collecting data on \"practice characteristics;' and using such data to make projectionson the need for health professionals In the future. The AMA has developeddraft legislation (attached) to address thisThe mandate to collect data on practice characteristics should bedeleted from the law. Such specific date, when coupled with the other Infor-mation collected, could serve to Identify individual practitioners. The AMAis concerned with the possibility that information may be Improperly disclosed.We ere also concerned that the Secretary's authority to make projectionson the future needs of health personnel could have the potential of 'lisping the future directions in medical education and the education of other healthcare personnel by using a single study as the basis for planning. TheGraduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) Is an example 27D 274 -7- of an organization that has set out to project future medical practitioner needs.GMEMAC has completed its study, but its methodologies and findingsare highly controversial and have been widely criticized. The AMA stronglyrecommend, that studies concerning the need and supply of health carepersonnel be continued in the most cost-efficient manner by non-governmentalorganizations, using a variety of models and assumptions based on data and analyses of trends. Construction FundsThe proposed legislation makes construction funds available in theform of loan guarantees and Interest subsidies to assist nonprofit privateentities to carry out approved construction projects. S.799does notauthorize any funds for grants to public or other nonprofit institutions.Additionally, the statutory enrollment Increases that are tied to construction funds will be repealed.The MA supports the provision that would delete the enrollment Increaserequirement that is currently tied to receipt of construction funds. However, we are concerned over the limited nature of the entities eligible to receiveconstruction funds under the proposal before the committee. We would recommendthat such funds be available to more than Just nonprofit private entities,and that these funds be limited in use to renovation and modernization of existing facilities.The MA recognizes that funds for construction assistance are limited, and itIs our belief that expending these monies for construction of newmedical schools would not be appropriate at this time. Many medical schools 200 275 -8- need to upgrade their facilities, and we believe that any funds allocated for construction assistance would generate the greatest return if they are funneled toward modernization and renovation of existing facilities. General Institutional SupportUnlike H.R. 2004, the health manpower bill currently under consideration in the Nouse, and the health manpower legislation that passed in both the Nouse and the Senate last year, S. 799 would abruptly end general institu- tional support.As we have already pointed out, general institutional support of medical schools has served the public interest by aiding and improving the quality and availability of medical education and medical care.While the amount that an institution can receive under this program is not great, these funds are flexible and enable medical faculties to focus their use on their institution's needs and the needs of the community. We are concerned that an abrupt discontinuation of these funds will force institutions to retrench some of their essential programs, particularly in the services basic to medical practice, and to look to other government programs or to increased tuition as a means to recapture these funds.The AMA recommends that the general institutional support program be phased-out. Such a phase-out would allow for those institutions that rely on these monies time to develop other sources of funds while continuing without the substantial disruption that would be caused by the total elimina- tion of the program. 281 276 -9- Financial Distress Grants The bill tefore the committee provides for a dual program for institu-tions in financial distress. The first program would allow Institutionsthat have not received funds under the existing program for the past threeyears to enter into grants or contracts with the Secretary to help themmeet costs, accreditation requirements, or carry out operational reforms.The second program would establish \"advanced financial distress grants\" forSchools of Medicine, Osteopathy, Dentistry, Optometry, Podiatry, VeterinaryMedicine or Pharmacy if those individual institutions have previouslyreceived financial distress funds for the past three years. Institutionseligible for advanced grants may receive these funds for up to five yearsand they are obligated to find additional nonfederal support and to workto eliminate the need for further federal support. The AMA believes that financial distress grants can serve a valuableneed in aiding institutions whose financial problems have reached crisisproportions.The financial problem* of some schools, particularly thoseschools enrolling a large proportion of minority students, are deeply rootedand do not appear susceptible to short-term solutions. For this reason, theAMA has developed draft legislation (attached) to address this need. Wedo support the Intent of the financial distress provisions of S. 799. However,the AKA is concerned over the fact that the bill only authorizes funds forthis program through FY 1984. We would recommend that the program beauthorized for five years, and that multi-year grant authority with advancedfunding be available so that the purpose of these grants can be fulfilled. Finally, we are concerned over the fact that the program Is only authorized 282 277 -10- $9 million annually, and that this may prove inadequate. As structured, financial distress grants would only be available for a limited period oftime and institutions receiving these monies would have to work to create solvent programs. Failure to do so would result in the ultimate failure of the institution. It is our view that If an institution is worthy ofreceiving a financial distress grant, there should be adequate funds to aid the institution in becoming fiscally sound. Student AssistanceS. 799 would continue the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL)program and allow loans issued under this program to be consolidated Ith those Issued under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Additionally, restric- tions on the percentage of a class receiving HEAL loans will be repealed,and funds received under this program will be allowed to be used for living expenses.Payment of interest will be deferred for an additional year, andstudents of medicine will be able to borrow up to $80,000 with an annual limitation of $20,000. Finally, borrowers under this program may elect a graduated payment plan with smeller initial payments upon completion of training.The bill would also discontinue additional funding for the HealthProfessic al Student Loan (HPSL) program, with the program continuing to use funds that exist in the revolving fund. HPSL Interest rates will be set at 9% annually.S. 799 would also repeal the Exceptional Financial Need scholarship program.As stated above, the availability of financial aid for medical students is of paramount Importance. With medical school tuition rising, 233 278 and with institutions looking for additional sources of revenue, a limita-tion on the availability of financial aid could have the effect of creatingmedical school cl hat are not representative of the population asa whole.Students entering medical school should have the opportunity toapply for financial assistance from a variety of programs. We note withconcern that existing federal programs would be severely limited under thebill before this committee, and could have the effect of precludingqualified applicants from attending medical school.Some of the changes in the HEAL program that are proposed in S. 799are ILj overdue, and we endorse them as practical actions that can onlybenefit loan recipients. The proposed graduated payment plan, theadditional deferral o' Interest payments, the authority to use HEAL moneyfor living expenses, the ability to consolidate HEAL loans with HigherEducation Act loans, the repeal of class restrictions coupled with MEALloans, and the increase in the amount students can borrow under the HEALprogram all represent positive steps. These actions will allow for moreflexibility in the HEAL program and AMA supports them.The HEAL program is continued with $100 million being authorizedon an annual basis for FYs 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986. While welaud the fact that this program is being continued and that funds willbe available through 1986, the total amount being authorized for the nextfive fiscal years will still fall $20 million short of the authorizedfunding level for FY 1980. Coupling this with the reductions proposed forthe MPSL program and the Exceptional Financial Need program, the very realpossibility exists that medical students will be facing a financialcrisis In the immediate future. We urge the committee to closely examine 2 s 279 -12- the programs for student assistance before any cuts in the programs are made.Additionally, we would recommend that a program for studentassistance, providing for flexibility in funding and career choice, alongthe lines that we have discussed in the earlier portion of this statement,be initiated. National Health Service CorpsS. 801 would make major changes in the basic structure of the National Health Service Corps program. Under this bill, health manpower shortage areas will be redefined so as to include only geographic a and in the designation process the Secretary of HHS will consider the ratio ofavailable health manpower, access to care, and the likelihood that the demandfor are will not be met within the next two years. In making designations, local medical and professional societies will be given an opportunity to comment on the proposed designation. Assignments'of Corps personnel to the shortage areas will only be made after a determination of need by theSecretary, and after local medical and professional societies had beenafforded an opportunity to comment on assignments.The NHSC scholarship program would also be the subject of significant alterations under S. 801. First, the program would be shifted to Title ill of the Public Health Service Act In recognition of the fact that the NHSCis designed to offer medical services in areas of legitimate need, andIs not designed to be primarily a financial assistance program for medical students.Under the bill before thli committee, scholarship contractsmade in FY 1982 would provide the ,ecrstary the option to convert theservice contract into a 72 loan oblf9atmn upon complation of training 2S5 280 -13- with the service obligation being eliminated. The Secretary would alsohave authority to negotiate similar modifications with pre-FY 1982 scholar-ship recipients, and the Secretary would be able to establish lower interestrates for those individuals who establish independent practice in ashortage area. The scholarship program would be continued with fundingadequate to only continue existing scholarships, with no new scholarshipsbeing offered. Finally, the independent practice option would be encouraged. The AMA he; recently completed a lengthy analysis of the NationalHealth Service Corps program. The AMA isin agreement with the intent ofthe provisions of S. 801 that would authorize greater medical communityInput into the designation and placement of Corps personnel. We also agreewith the proposal that would limit NHSC scholarhsips to those who haveexisting scholarships. However, the provisions of S. 801 should be modifiedso that the goat of the Corps, i.e., long-term community service, will beaccomplished.The designation and staffing process should be reformed to specificallyauthorize approval by local and state medical societies prior to the designa-tion of a shortage area and the assignment of Corps personnel. Of course,the Secretary should have the authority to override a medical societydecision In the unlikely event of an arbitrary withholding of approval. Withsuch provisions, as provided in earlier law, s with manpower needs would more likely be served on a long-term basis. The new provision in the independent practice option that would obligatephysicians who elect this option to accept Medicare assignment or be found In breach of their contract would most certainly be counterproductive. As a matter of fact, to attach such conditions under the label of \"independent\" 286 281 practice is at best an anomelly. A provision mandating the physician to accept assignments (generally a reduced fee) in all cases regardless of individual circumstances does not create a practice environment that isconducive for the physician to create a long-term practice. We are concerned that a requirement for acceptance of Medicare assignment wouldactually discourage the desire to fulfill a service obligation throughthe private practice mode, when in fact, encouragement should be provided. Incentives for long-term private practice are needed, and mandatoryacceptance of Medicare assignments would not lead to the development of a viable practice. The AMA would recommend that the buy-out optinn provision be alteredto authorize the Secretary to only negotiate a buy-out option with NHSC scholarship recipients. The provision included in S. 801 that would authorize the Secretary the option unilaterally to convert a scholarship into a 7 loan and eliminate the service obligation does a disservice to the scholarship recipient.Those individuals in the NHSC pipeline desiring to continue theirCorps scholarship would discover that their obligations could be radically changed upon completion of training. Under the proposed change, an individual who truly desires to serve in an underserved area as a Corps member could find him or herself with an obligation to pay off a substantial loan obligation.Ideally, the Secretary should only have the authority to negotiate such a contract modification with all NHSC scholarship recipients. CONCLUSIONThe American Medical Association would be pleased to work with the committee and its staff in the development of health manpower legislation. 28 7 282 -15- WO are well were of the need to keep the federal budget within reasonablelimits, and the necessity to balance this need with the government's role in health manpower programs. In recognizing the desire to pare the federalbudget, we accept the fact that health manpower programs will not befunded at the same levels as in past years. We urge the committee toreview these issues with care, and to consider not only the budgetaryimpact of such decisions, but to consider how those actions will affectthe nation's ability to deliver quality medical are both now and In the future. 28& 283 February, 1981 DATA COLLECTION AMENDMENTS This bill would amend provisions of the health manpower lawpertaining to data collection on health manpower by deleting authorityof the Secretary to collect \"practice characteristics\" of practitioners,by deleting physicians and dentists as a special class from whom dataare collected and by prohibiting HMS collection of Identifiable information. - AMEAICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -DEPARTMENT OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION, DIVISION OF et7o a:and as; Public Health Service Act to protect ihe privacy of health ,.' - ;;;,:;-*,..sif.,:as-,ri:/7;-,.i:-. ,..-a...,1-..-::.i...,..-g':,.-.,....:, ,..?..4 ...... --,(niintIng \"4: .,3, ,t?,-\" 11(40 in the third sentence delete the words 'and such other 'flemegraphIc 2 0 285 -2- Information regarding health professions personnel as the Secretary2way require\" and insert in lieu thereof the following: \", except that 3no information shall be transferred by t.lyentity to the Secretary underthis section, collected by the St *tory under this, section, or ealutaibcd5In any record under this program that would identify any individual health'Professional\u00b0.-7SECTION 2.Section 706(e) of the Public Health Service Act `; hereby repealed.. .

The membership of the associations comprising the Joint Health Policy Committee represent a majority of institutions of higher education in the United States that provide the training of most members of the health professions, the training of professionals who conduct research, and are the sites for the conduct of the preponderance of biomedical research in this country. We have feared that the complexity of the national budget coupled with the complexity of major research intensive institutions might result in a lack of attention to the cumu- lative impact of budgets actions across a wide array of health and research programs.The expression - The whole is larger than the sum of its parts\" - applies equally today to the major research- intensive university as well as to the proposed budget changes for FT'8I and FT.82. There is no other committee in either house of Congress that has as much impact an the university as this Committee with its jurisdiction over the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Education, and even the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. However, we are compelled to point out that other committees of the Congress as well as Executive Agencies also have jurisdictions which impinge significantly on our total structure.Over the past several decades our institutions, with the financial assistance of the federal government, have created great academic health centers.The health center has become a driving force for excellence for the entire campus. The quality of education programs even at the undergraduate level often is rooted in the sophisticated research and training programs for the health professions. The quality of excellence that permeates research conducted in all disciplines frequently is enhanced by the momentum created by the academic health center.It also is true that the fiscal stability of our campuses is greatly affected by the fiscal condition of the academic health center, which both attracts funds for the conduct of research and training and demands, in turn, large funding to carry on productive programs. 2 9 s 293 -2- We believe that the federal government and our own education and research community have reason to be proud of what we have accomplished together in Just the past few decades.The preeminence of this country in biomedicalresearch can be measured in a number of ways:Nobel prizes awarded to American scientist; significant advances inknowledge in biomedicine leading to improvement in healthfor all citizens of the world; numbers of American citizensand visitors from foreign countries being trained forcareers in health care in our nation's universities andteaching hospitals. In response to a national determinationthat a shortage of physicians and other health professionalsexisted, our campuses expanded rapidly. Now, national concern has shifted to the potential surplus of healthprofessions.Wihout exaggeration, we are profoundlyconcerned for the future condition of the health educationand research enterprise that we have built together.We lave attached a document to our testimony that outlines the entire range of proposed federal budget savings that have an impact on the fiscal stability of higher educationinstitutions.If all of these were to be implementedsimultaneously, the impact on our institutions would be extraordinary. Some of the smaller and free standing medicalschools and other health professions institutions might be particularly vulnerable to program reduction. Among them are institutions that especially serve minority students,presenting special social implications. The major institu- tions will not close their doors. Instead, they will be forced to trim back what they do in education and researchprograms and particularly in research training, foregoingexcellence and becoming used to mediocrity.These multiple budget cuts will affect the fundamentalstructure of academic institutions. Intentional and planned academic program cutbacks raise deep concerns, but cutbacks not academic may be equally serious by damaging inadvertentlysome linkin the total academic structure.To address the issue of health manpower: a large number of our students come to health professions programs already bearing substantial debts incurred during theirundergraduate education. Budget proposals before Congress may eliminate or at least diminish student assistanceprograms ofall kinds.The ability to pay for health professions training has suffered since institutions have 290 294 -3- lost capitation programs, received less funding from thestates because of local economic exigencies or the reductionof funds in other federal programs. Tuitions will have tobe raised.Access for health professions education to alleconomic classes of our country will be more difficult. Newopenings into the National Health Service Corps will notexist.Subsidized student loans will be greatly modified;our graduates will no longer reflect all economic and socialstrata but will disproportionately reflect higher incomebackgrounds.Some students will bet on themselves and their futuresand incur extraordinarly high debts. Our worst \"caseestimates indicate that young physicians Just beginn-ing in practice may have a cumulative annual debt serviceranging between $15,000 and $27,000. These debts willpreclude some of the finest talents in research from enteringthose career specialities.where rewards are lower. It willreduce the number of interested and qualified healthprofessionals who will be able to afford primary care as a speciality.AcadeMic medicine, which, after all, is thebasis for the next generation of practioners and researchscholars will become less attractive. In basic research,young researchers tend to be most productive and mostinnovative.These bright young researchers should beencouraged, not lost, at their most valuable period. Itis equally important to note that the term healthprofessionals' does not mean only M.D.'s. Other health professions education is also lengthy, costly and often doesnot provide the future earning potential of physicians inhighly specialized private practice. Nevertheless,this distinction among the health professions, and withinmedicine Itself, is not taken into account in current orproposed legislation.Students in the health professions hays, reliedheavily on the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. ItIs inevitable that major changes will take place in thatprogram to cut costs in the feoral government. Some of theproposed changes could make those loans extremely expensive.Other changes at the undergraduate level involve a cut forPC81 of 40% in the National Di-ect Student Loan Programspecifically designed for low income students, serious andsignificant changes in the 8E0G-Pell Grant program thatcould revoke the changes enacted in the Middle IncomeStudent Assistance Act requiring middle income students toborrow mere. 30o 295 -4- Toshift from health manpower to biomedical research,there are two major academic elements in biomedical research:training of the next generation of research scholars andthe actual conduct of research by faculty and associates.In our testimony to this committee on April 1st, we delineatedin some detail our concern with the proposal for eliminatingall institutional allowances and indirect cost for theNational Research Service Award program. We reemphasizethat those funds are essential and are needed to help payfaculty to conduct training, to pay for supplies and essentialInstruments and equipment. If the federal governmentprovides only ;tipends for students these programs will beradically altered. The universities will not be able tosustain training programs of excellence if they are requiredto subsidize all the related costs of these programs. Forexample, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine hasestimated the impact of several Administration proposals;for research training, a loss of 5731,000 in institutionalawards and $150,000 in individual awards; for investigatorinitiated research a loss of approximately $300,000; forhealth manpower, $307,000 in institutional assistance and asignificant loss of student aid (70% of students take loanswhich total approximately S2M/year). At Washington UniversitySchool of Medicine and at the University of California SanFrancisco School of Medicine the estimated losses fromreductions in training grant programs alone are S2 millionannually for each institution. The same numbers are presentedin virtually every one of our university health centers.As we indicated earlier, it is extremely important tonote that some of the more serious implications for academicmedicine lie in programs outside of the jurisdiction of thiscommittee.The programs of our teaching hospitals are anintegral part of our academic enterprise. Among th* 325 non-federal members of the Council of Teaching Hospitals, 65hospitals (20%) nave over 25 percent Medicaid admission.Therefore, proposed cuts in both Medicaid and Medicareprograms are likely to have a disproportionately deleteriousefect on those very institutions that are training tomorrow'sphysicians and researchers. Let me give you some examples.In the State of Missouri about a dozen hospitals care for90% of the State's Medicaid patients. At the University ofIllinois 60% of patients treated at the university hospitalare from families with an income of 57,500 or less. Theseinstitutions would receive substantially less funds inreimbursements under Medicaid because of the proposed 3 O.: 296 -5- \"CAP.*We are told by our colleagues at Stanford University that the cumulative impact of Budget Committee proposals for cuts in the Finance Committee (Medicare and Medicaid programs) would result in a loss of $10.7 million for that university's hospital in FY'82.Different institutions naturally are affected in different ways.Eliminations of the N1OSH program would have dire consequences for public health schools. Other programs are limited to few instituions. At the Health Services Adminis- tration two relatively small research and training programs in maternal and preventive health care research are marked for elimination. The University of Alabama at Birmingham, which in the past two decades has grown into one of the preeminent medical centers in its region stands to lose approximately S2 112 million for research training funds because of those cuts. Other institutions are affected by other cuts, but every institution is feeling the cumulative rate of the new federal budgetary disciplines.A few years ago me were reading about surpluses in many state budgets. We now find that, with a few exceptions of states with large petroleum industries, most states are struggling to balance their own budgets and may feel constrained to do so by restricting support for inner city programs. The hard times now effecting the automobile industry are well known.The University of Michigan has layed offhundreds of employees. Michigan State University has gone fur the,and may be forced to cut tenured faculty and reduce programs to me-.t the fiscal savings demanded by the state government.The problems in the auto industry are not restricted to Michigan. St. Louis is one of the major centers for assembling automobiles and the state of Missouri is experiencing its own financial pressures. While the states may be considered an appropriate source of support, it grows increasingly unlikely 'hat they will have the option of being of immediate assistance.The potential cumulative impact for our institutions is very significant. Recently, we heard Senator Schmidt discuss the choices made by the nation in early 1960's. He said, and we paraphrase, that had the United States chosen not to embark on its space program, it would have been equivalent toa decision by the English Government not tobecome a great naval power in the 17th Century. While we take pride in serving humanity for our biomedical research Programs. we also recognize in this troubled world that there are other significant reasons why this nation must 3 0 .,..,, 297 -6- remain number one in certain areas. As national policywe must continue to defend biomedical programs adequatelyenough to permit this nation to retain preeminent positionamong the nations.As you prepare authorizing legislation, may we drawto the Committee's attention a statutory inconsistencybetween Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and thePublic Health Service Act's sex discrimination provisions(Sections 799a and 845) which prevent students attendingwomen's colleges from receiving both program and studentassistance funds under the Public Health Service Act. At least 30 women's colleges are disadvantaged by this conflict.Congress exempted the admissions practices of independentundergraduate institutions from coverage of Title IX of theEducation Amendments of 1972 in order to ensure continuededucational diversity in independent higher education. The 1971 Amendments to the Public Health Service Act prohibitdiscrimination on the basis of sex in health trainingprograms and contain no similar independent college exemption.In order to come into compliance with the PHSA as it nowstands,a women's college will either have to give up itseducational mission and admit men generally or establish itsnursing or other health affected programs as separateschools with a separate co-ed admissions policy, thusremoving these programs from the educational benefitsattendant to full integration with the total undergraduateProgram offered by the college, o- forego the receipt offederal financial assistance.The current result does not appear to have been intended.The Public Health Service Act was amended in 1971 duringfloor debate on the 1971 Nurse Training and Health ManpowerActs primarily because there was no existing provision offederal law that prohibited discrimination a ainst women inmedical training programs. Title IX was signe into law in1972 and is a later, more comprehensive statement of Congressionalintent on discrimination in education programs. We respect-fully urge the Committee to amend the Public Health ServiceActso as to bring it into conformity with Title IX.One final observation. As programs are examined withan eye toward cutting, we are told that the Chairman of thiscommittee looks upon a program in terms of three standards:whether itis cost effective, whether it is an appropriatefederal function and whether it has high enough priority.With regard to cost effectiveness - we can only ask thequestion that has been asked before. How much has thenation saved in the past two decades because of the development 303 298 -7- ofa vaccine against poliomyelitis? The same questioncan be applied to the current availability of drugs andvaccines to keep our people active and contributing theirefforts as well as their taxes rather than looking to thegovernment to keep from dire poverty. Our national expen-diture for health services is approximately S240 billiondollars.The total devoted to health research is only 3%of that.Since health research fundings often lead to preveitivecare that would obviate the need for experience traatment,we believe that from the point of view of investment aloneour nation must continue to provide adequate support forbiomedical research.With regard to the federal role: we believe thathealth is akin to national defense and agriculture. States may fund a national guard unit and support research anddemonstration program effecting the food supply, but ultimatelya coordinated effort has to be conducted at the nationallevel.Nothing done in one state is kept within the boundariesof that state. Medical research conducted at any medicalcenter is conducted in behalf of the entire nation and everycitizen is a potential beneficiary of that. like our nationaldefense, our health education training and research programsdepend on the federal governments.As for priority, we do not presume to establish prioritiesfor this committee or for the Congress, but we do notbelieve that the health of the nation has become a lesseroriority to the citizens of this country or the world. Weurge this committee and your colleagues in the Senate toevaluate the implication of proposals before you today toinsure that both in the short and long term we do not, inthe interest of an immediate and gravely significantobjective of budgetary control, cut down what we will becompelled to build again at greater cost and with lesseffectiveness as we will have lost a generation of students,faculty and research scholars. 3 0 4 299 N160.1SUA U,\" WIandlanOGrantCarvesban L. oma,.

Educational Assistance and Nurse Training Amendments of1981.In particular, we are vitally interested in Title II,containing amendments to and authorizations for various sectionsof the existing Nurse Training Act, a portion of the overallPublic Health Service Act.AMA is a professional organization whose membership iscomprised of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs).There are presently about 15,000 active practicing CRNAs in theUnited States. Each one of these individuals holds uniquequalifications which allow him or her to administer anesthesia.CRNAs must hold a current license as a registered professionalnurse, must have graduated from an accredited program of nurseanesthesia, must have passed a rigid qualifying examination,and must be involved in a program of continuing education inanesthesia.A.NURSE ANESTHETIST TRAINEESHIPSWe are interested in legislation to extend the authorityfor the nurse anesthetist traineeship grants program (Section 831)initially authorized by the Nurse Training Amendments of 1979.That program was authorized for FY 1980 only at a level of $2million, but did not receive a supplemental appropriation thatyear.We favor maintaining a separate authorization for thisprogram and would therefore urge the Committee to fund the pro-gram for fiscal 1982 and not approve Section 207 of S. 799 whichwould repeal outright this traineeships provision. 31 1 305 - 2 - 1.The Education Program and Training of a Nurse AnesthetistThe CRNA is a much needed element within the health caresystem. A description of the type of intensive education programwhich the CRNA must complete brings into sharper focus the reasonsfor having an adequately funded program for the training of nurseanesthetists.Building on the professional nursing base, the stu-dent nurse anesthetist must complete a program which includesorientation to anesthesia practice; chemistry and physics anesthetic of \"contact hours\" for each part of this curri-culum ranges from 35 to 120.Also included in the clinical program is a requirement ofa minimum of 600 hours of actual anesthesia time in which clinicalinstruction is provi&d in situations where students actuallyadminister the anesthesia. Other requirements include a minimumof 450 cases of anesthesia actually administered, with thesecases distributed according to types of techniques required andvariety of drugs used. With this type of background, thereshould be no doubt as to the ability of the CRNA to providethe patient with quality anesthesia care.Training programs ere graduate-level programs for regis-tered nurses.Training involves 24 consecutive months of coursework and clinical instruction. A certificate of graduation isreceived when the program is successfully completed.Alltraining programs are accredited by an accreditation body ap-proved by the Department of Education. 31 306 - 3 - 2.The Dimensions of Nurse Anesthetist PracticeAs previously stated, the CRNA is a vital element withinthe health care system in the United States. Nationwide, nurseanesthetists are providing safe, reliable and economical anesthesiatreatment to approximately one-half of all patients undergoing anes-thesia.Included in this statistic is the fact that in rural areasnurse anesthetists account for approximately two-thirds of allanesthesia treatment rendered. Throughout many areas in thecountry, nurse anesthetists are the only providers of anesthesiatreatment.For example, in a 1971 survey of hospitals, fortypercent of all of the hospitals surveyed had only nurse anes-thetists on the steff. According to figures published inthe February,1978 issue of Anesthesiology, the national meanpopulation ratio for active practicing nurse anesthetists is7.20 per 100,000. This figure compares with a distribution of4.64 anesthesiologists per 100,000. A breakdown of these figureson a regional basis shows that the areas with the thinnest dis-tribution of anesthesiologists have the highest distributionpatterns for nurse anesthetists. 3.Supply and Need for Nurse AnesthetistaNot only are CRNAs a vital segment of the health care sys-tem within the United States, but there is also a definite pro-jected need for more nurse anesthetists now and in the future.According to a 1976 study by the H.E.W. Bureau of HealthManpower on \"Supply, Need and Distribution of Anesthesiologistsand Nurse Anesthetists in the United States, 1972 and 1980\"(HRA: 77-31), there was a projected need of from 22,000 to 25,000nurse anesthetists for 1980. Obviously, there is currently a 307 - 4- serious shortage in this field in the United States of from 7,000to 10,000 active, practicing nurse anesthetists. Inclusion ofthe traineeships for students in schools of nurse anesthesiain the Nurse Training Amendments of 1979 was the important firststep on the part of the ?ederal Government to rectify this short-age.The next step can be taken by authorizing funds for thenext fiscal year.The fact that nurse anesthetists are a significant groupin delivery of anesthesia services was pointed out graphicallyby Dr. Feldstein of the University of Michigan in a study ofthe 16,500,000 surgical procedures performed in 1974.The largestpercentage of anesthetics was 3.5% by registerednurses other than CRNAs. A further breakdown of those proceduresindicates that certified, registered anesthetists administeredapproximately two-thirds of all the anesthesia procedures inhospitals smaller than 100 beds. Anesthesiologists tend tocongregate in larger hospitals, over 200 beds, where theyadministered 47.5% of all anesthesia compared to 42.5% forCertified Registered Anesthetists.4.Economics of Nurse Anesthetist ServicesThe majority of nurse anesthetists are salaried hospitalstaff, whose services are billed by the hospital as part ofhospital operating room costs. According to the U.S. Departmentof Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 'Industry Wage Survey ofHospitals, August,1975 - January, 1976', the average hourly 314 908 - 5 - wage for nurse anesthetists working in 21 major metropolitanareas was $8.02. Based on a 40-hour work week, the average annualearnings for a nurse anesthetist would have been $16,681.60.This figure compares with full-time equivalency earnings ofhospital-based anesthesiologists of $80,000 as determined by aHealth Care Financing Administration Study of the Reimbursementand Practice Arrangements of Provider-Based Physicians, December,1977 (Contract No. 600-76-1155). An analysis of these two sal-ary figures indicates that where nurse anesthetists are providinganesthesia services, the cost to the patient should be substan-tially lover than where anesthesiolgists are providing theservices.Even where a team approach is used, the fact thatsome of the time utilised is of CRNAs rather than anesthesio-logists would indicate efficiency and cost savings. S.Need for Federal Trainin SupportNurse anesthetists are clearly a shortage field in healthcare.Possibly twice as many nurse anesthetists are needed forthe 1980s as are practicing now, according to the HEW studycited above.One of the largest obstacles to obtaining an adequatesupply of nurse anesthetists is the lack of financial supportfor trainees.Training programs are generally for two years --a substantial graduate program. The total of tuition and allcosts is about $10,000 for hospital-based programs and about$15,000 for most college and university-affiliated programsper year.Tuition costs range considerably with some at$2,000 to $2,500 and others only nominal with the hospitalassuming all costs. Hopsitals also offer stipends but the 315 309 - 6- average is about $3,000. With hospitals attempting to limitcosts and inflation unchecked, hospitals are able to devote lessto these programs than in prior years.In fact, the number ofhospitals offering stipends has decreased substantially inrecent years due to higher costs of operation.Few offer themnow.In addition, many hospitals have dropped their programsentirely.The number has decreased from 225 to 145 in recentyears.Students are generally unable to hold summer or part-time jobs because the nurse anesthesia programs run for 24consecutive months. In addition, rotating clinical schedulesprevent part-time work in the evenings and on weekends. Thefinancial problems mentioned above deter students from enter-ing this field. Loans are difficult to obtain and entry levelsalaries are in the $15,000 range with average salaries after5 years at $20,000. Such salary levels are not conducive toborrowing, particularly if an individual has a family to support.Traineeship support authorized at $3 million, for example,would provide grants of about $2,000 to each of the 1500 traineespresently enrolled in training courses.To the institution, the major financial burden is inmaking stipends available to students.With living costs whatthey are and with no time for part-time work, stipends arecritical.Institutions put up $3,000 on the average towardthese living and educational costs of at least $10,000. Limitedresources prevent institutions from offering more aid or fromoffering aid to more students. Federal support to the institu-tions for traineeships will allow a greater number of studentsto enter programs since some programs are prevented from expend- 31 6 310 - 7 - ing due to the lack of stipend money. It will also help relievethe burden on low income students to permit their entry into theprogram.In addition, with a Federal share of some of thetraineeship costs, institutions will be able to devote some oftheir future funding to program expansion in other vital areas.It should be noted that the number of nurse anesthetiststraining programs has decreased in recent years by about BO.These are the smaller programs. Federal support may preventsuch harmful attrition, and at the same time stimulate thedevelopment of new programs.Mr. Chairman, AANA is hopeful that this Committee and theCongress will adopt a nurse anesthetist traineeships authoriza-tion for the next fiscal year. This vital program will greatlyenhance the quality of medical care for all Americans in the yearsand decades to come. B.ADVANCED NURSE TRAININGWe support continued funding for advanced nurse trainingprograms.This is institutional support and is used to plan,develop, operate, expand, or maintain programs for the advancedtraining of professional nurses. Under Section 203 of S. 799,public and non-profit private institutions who train professionalnursesto serve in various fields of advanced clinical practice\"would be eligible for this assistance. This would include hos-pitals and colleges which train licensed, registered nurses tobe nurse anesthetists. Institutional aid can be put to good useby hospitals and colleges to develop new programs or bolsterexisting programs forthe training of nurse anesthetists. Weare presently experiencing a severe shortage of training programs 317 311 - 8 - -- down from 225 to 145, a drop of 80 programs, in recent years.Institutional support can help reverse this disadvantageous trend. C.NURSE ANESTHETIST TRAINEE LOANSAANA also supports the specific inclusion of nurse anesthe-tist trainees in the nursing student loan program under Sections835-840 of the Public Health Service Act. By making nurseanesthetist trainees eligible for the same loan program asnursing students, we can further help to insure an adequate supplyof qualified CRNAs for all the reasons discussed above withrespect to traineeships.For the consideration of the Committee, we offer draftstatutory language. Section 835(b) should be redesignated Section835(c) with the following inserted as Section 835(b): \"TheSecretary is authorized to enter into an agreement for theestablishment and operation of a student trainee loan fund inaccordance with this subpart with any public or private non-profit program meeting such requirements as the Secretary byregulation shall prescribe and accredited by an entity or enti-ties designated by the Secretary of Education for the trainingof licensed, registered nurses to be nurse anesthetists\".Technical and conforming amendments elsewhere in Sections 835-840 might roughly include adding \"or trainee(s)\" after\"student(s1\" wherever it appears, and by appropriately adding\"or training institution(s)\" after \"school(s)\"; \"certificateof graduation from a course of training to be a nurse anesthe-tist\" after degree-diploma-graduate degree in nursing;\"program(s)for the training of after\"school(s) of nursing\"; and \"nurse anesthetist\" after \"nurse\". 3 1 Mr. Chairman, we would be happy to work further with you andyour Committee in drafting appropriate statutory amendments.AMA firmly believes that financially deserving nurseanesthetist trainees should be eligible to receive long-term,low interest loans to help finance their courses of study.Thank you. 319 313 STATEMENT OF The Coalition for Allied Health Professions Education ON 1981 LEGISLATION TO AMEND AND EXTEND CURRENT HEALTH-MANPOWER TRAINING AUTHORITIES CONTAINED IN TITLE VII OF THE rUELIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT (AS AMENDED) Presented toThe Committee on Labor and Human Resourcesof theUnited States Senate 3 20 314 2/ The Allied Health Community Mr. Chairman, the Allied Health professions are hetero-geneous in the extreme, differing in the competencies theyrequire, their respective requisite educational preparation,the scientific foundations for their knowledge bases, and theclinical and educational roles which they play in the nation'shealth-care delivery system.Required competencies vary from the performance of rela-tively routine tasks to the highest levels of education andservice-delivery administration and the generation of newknowledge through research. Similarly broad is the range ofeducational preparation the Allied Health professions require --from limited post-secondary training t) postdoctoral study.The time required for such preparation ranges from severalmonths to more than a few years. The scientific foundationsof Allied Health profession expertise range from severalmonths to more than a few years. The scientific foundationsof Allied Health profession expertise range from the biologicaland chemical sciences (IA,, clinical laboratory professionals).to the social sciences (1,g,, social workers and clinicalpsychologists), to combinations of the physical and socialsciences and the humanities (e.g., speech pathologists,rehabilitation counselors).Some Allied Health professionals are involved primarilyin institutional patient care, others in communityhealthpromotion and protection, still others in health-care research, 321 315 3/ manpower training, and education and service deliveryadministration. The range of Allied Health services includes:emergency services (1,8, emergency medicaltechnicians, physician assistants);reception and screening anddental secretaries, medical assiscancs);,inicialevaluatioriciia:osisan (1,&,, audio-logiscs, workers);. ..,-.continued assessment as occupational therapistsrespiratory therapists, speech pathologists, audio-logiscs, dietitians);cescin(e.g., medical laboratory personnel, technologists, ultrasound technical specialists,nuclear medicine personnel, cardiology equipmentpersonnel);acute cars therapy operating room technicians, obstetrical assistants, surgeons' assistants);long-term care therapy (ta, occupational, physicaland ocher therapists; personnel in mental health andsocial services, counseling, speech pathology, audio-logy. nutrition);medical instrumentation (e.g., radiation and respira- tory therapists, dialysis technicians, cardiopulmon-ary technicians, opchalmic dispensers, dental labora-tory technicians);community health promotion and protection (e.g.,nutritionists, dental hygienists, population andfamily planning specialists, health educators, schoolhealth educators, medical librarians, health writers);environmental health Promotion and protection (e.g.,sanicarians, environmental health technicians, sani-tarian aides, environmental engineering assistants);control and elimination of hazards in an institu-tional or industrial setting (e., audiologists,health physicists, health care fag.cility housekeepers,industrial hygienists); 83-620 CO-In--21322 316 4/ health systems management hospital administra-tors, health planners, medical records personnel,medical computer specialists);research and development (e,g,, biomedical engineers,biostatisticians, epidemioiiiiiits, toxicologists,public health scientists, and researchers in everyoccupational category).An essential feature of Allied Health education since the1960s has been its rapid change and expansion, characterized bythe following three major ingredients: First, there has been atremendous growth in the number of programs, particularly incollegiate settings, which has paralleled the great expansionof two-year colleges and the growing popularity of vocationalprograms (in 1966, there were an estimated 2,500 collegiateprograms; today there are over 8,000); second, the distributionof programa has changed -- hospitals and other health-servicesettings still play an important role, but the greatest programgrowth has occurred in such other settings as medical centersand universities, two-year colleges, vocational technicalinstitutes, and private career schools; third, a dramaticexpansion of knowledge and skill requirements has led toincreased diversification of educational requirements.In 1976, the latest year for which there is adequate surveyinformation, there were about 14,000 formal postsecondar programsfor Allied Health personnel. Of these,52 to 54 percent were in collegiate settings33 to 35 percent were in hospitals10 to 12 percent were postsecondary non-collegiate institutions, andone percent were in the armed forces. 32 3 317 5/ Over half of the nation's 3,000 higher education institu-tions have at least one Allied Health program.Such programsare contained in about 90 percent of the nation's researchuniversities and doctoral-granting institutions, as well as inlarge proportions of comprehensive colleges and universities,free-standing medical centers, and two-year colleges. Signi-ficantly more than half of all Allied Health programs incollegiate institutions award degrees at the baccalaureate orhigher level.It may be important to point out here that these patternsof education for the Allied Health professions have grown outof practice needs, rather than from abstractly determinedsets of values. Thus, the history of Allied Health education,brief as it is, is closely related to the history of the occupa-tions themselves. The burgeoning of the Allied Health professionsand of Allied Health education is the product of increased andincreasing health-service demands and the explosive growth inhealth science and technology.Manpower data collection is not what it might be -- whatwe hope it can and will be -- in the area of Allied Health.Still, we can say with reasonable assurance that, as of ON.an estimated 3.5 million individuals (nearly 66 percent of thetotal health-care work force) could be classified, in thebroadest sense, as Allied Health practitioners. The core ofthis population -- the professions in which the federal govern- 324 318 6/ went has invested the bulk of its Allied Health manpower-training funds and which, generally, require collegiate pre-paration ranging from the associate degree to the doctorate-- has grown from 442,000 in 1966 to approximately 1,026,000 in1978.This 132-percent rate of growth compares with a 76-percent growth rate for all health professionals.Yet despite this growth, the Department of Health andHuman Services Bureau of Health Manpower (Health ResourcesAdministration)* tells us that there are still clear andsignificant national Allied Health manpower shortages in suchprofessions as audiology, speech pathology and respiratorytherapy.And though the data is not definitive, it alsoappears to the Bureau that there :till may be national shortagesof dietitians and dietetic technicians. radiation therapists,physical therapists, occupational therapists, and formally-trained dental assistants. Federal Support of Allied Health EducationFederal support for Allied Health manpower training wasfirst authorized in 1966 by the Allied Health ProfessionsPersonnel Training Act. During the first four years ofoperation under its authorities, the statute put primaryemphasis on increasing the number of training programs andprofessionals. In the early seventies, however, the statutewas amended, its emphasis shifted:. Basic improvement grants,which encouraged the establishment of new scholastic programs, * Report (to Congress) on Allied Health Personnel, DHHS Pub. No.(HRA) 80-28 325 319 7/ were abandoned in favor of new focuses and initiatives,relating more to the provision of quality Allied Healtheducation and health service than to the production ofincreases numbers of Allied Health professionals. The shiftclearly was occasioned by public economic policy, and not byevidence that manpower needs had been mat -- there were atleast as many \"significant\" national professional-area short-ages at the start of the seventies as there are today.The new funding focuses were on special educational pro-jects for Allied Health training programs (one special projectfocus addressed the need for the \"establishment of new rolesand functions for Allied Health\" personnel), on facultydevelopment through a mechanism celled \"advanced trainee-ships\", and on the recruitment to the Allied Health profes-sions and retention of ethnic minorities-group members.Funding authorizations which followed the shift from theearly basic improvement grants to the special target grantsand contracts were moderate, to say the most. But thismoderate support soon becan.e virtually no support at all.In fiscal year 1973, for oxample, Congress provided $30.2million to support Allied Health planning, development andoperation of such (sections 796, 797 and 798) projects asthe establishment of regional systems for coordinating andmanaging Allied Health training; of new and improved methodsof credentialing Allied Health Personnel; of recruitment,training and retraining programs; of career ladders and 326 320 8/ other programs of advancement; of continuing education programs;of faculty training institutes; and of ethnic minority-groupmember recruitment. Two years ago, following a CarterAdministration call for zero funding of Allied Health manpower-training programs and projects, the Allied Health communitywas able to win congressional support for a $10 million fiscal1980 appropriation for these Part G (Title VII) initiatives(one-third of that amount subsequently was rescinded). Lastyear, the Carter Administration again called for a zero fund-ing level.After Congress appropriated $6.7 million for fiscal1981, President Carter called for a rescission of all of thatamount and the new Administration appears similarly inclined.The rationale of both Administrations for these terminalreductions makes no sense at all. Spokesmen for both Adminis-trations have listed cost effectiveness, the delivery ofservices to unserved and underserved areas of the country,disease prevention and health promotion, and the involvementcf ethnic minority-group members in health-care educationand service delivery as major national health-care objectives.Yet, the Carter and Reagan Administrations have urged Congressto refuse any support for that segment of the health manpowerpopulation which is best prepared and best able to addressthese objectives.Both Administrations also have said that, inasmuch asthere are no manpower shortages among the Allied Health pro-fessions, \"continued federal involvement in basic Allied 327 321 9/ Health training support\" is unwarranted. The argument bothdenies and defies the reality of the Report of the federalgovernment's own health-manpower agency. which not onlymakes a \"case for continued Federal activity on behalf ofallied health personnel.\" but also lists a relatively largenumber of key Allied Health professions in which there are\"significant national shortages.\" But more -- both Administra-tions have overlooked the fact that federal Allied Health man-power-training fundings is expressly intended by statute forspecial-target projects and not for basic education support.Indeed, such basic support hasn't been available to the AlliedHealth professions for the better part of a decade!Some might argue that the $283 million invested by thefederal government (since 1967) in Allied Health manpowertraining is not only a substantial amount, but an appropriateamount us well. Substantial it well might b.; appropriate itmost assuredly is not. The $283 million figure -- the federalgovernment's total 14-year Fitment to two-thirds of thenation's health-care workforce -- represents merely four percentof the total federal investment in health-manpower trainingand development. From its beginnings. Allied Health has beenrelegated by the federal government to but a cubby hole inthe great mansion of health-care education.Today, there's aneviction notice on our small door. We hope this Committeewill tear down that notice and, in doing so. give notice ofits own that Allied Health can, must and will be counted on 322 10/ by the federal government as a major partner in the developmentof an effective manpower-training and service-delivery effort. Bureau of Health Professions RecommendationsThe Coalition believes that the federal government mustassume a ?eadership role in helping fill what RRA's Bureauof Health Professions terms as \"significant nationalHealth) shortages.\"In addition, we see a major federal responsibility in thefulfillment of these of the Bureau's Allied Health relatedrecommendations: 1.\"Information including statistical data onallied health personnel requires continued*movement, by larger investments and co-ordinated activities ...\"Particularly, data are needed with which todetermine the nature and extent .f 'criticalvacancies' and specific skills shortages,and to plan appropriate local, State.regional, or national education.\"Bettor data are needed on minorityparticipation in the work force.. 2.\"Special attention to the allied healthpersonnel problems of small health careinstitutions is required, to ensure thatregulatory and other constraints do notinterfere with access to and the qualityand continuity of patient care.

The Definition of \"Allied Health Personnel\" and \"trainingcenter for allied health personnel\" (Section 795 (1) and (2))Current statutory language defines \"Allied Health personnel\"as \"individuals with training and responsibilities for (A)supporting, complementing, or supplementing the professional:unctions of physicians, dentists, and other health profes- 3 31 325 13/ sionels in the delivery of health care to patients, or (B)assisting environmental engineers and other personnel inenvironmental health control and preventive medicine activities.\"The extant statutory portrait of Allied Health professionalsis completed in the section 795 (2) definition of \"trainingcenter for Allied Health professions,\" which lists as thegalt examples of those professions \"medical technology.optometric technology, and dental hygiene.\"The portrait is inappropriate and, as we shall offerlater, largely unnecessary. It is inappropriate for threereasons: a.The definition uses the term \"personnel\" ratherthan the term \"professional.\" Physicians and dentists and unidentified others are \"professionals:\" Allied Health practitioners are \"personnel.\" The distinction Is inappropriate and, we think. derogatory.b.The definition suggests that Allied Healthprofessionals always and everywhere work for or under the supervision of physicians, dentistsand environmental engineers. That's simply not true. c.Finally, the definition puts forward asexplicit examples of Allied Health practitionersnot the physical or occupational therapist, theiricaologist or speech pathologist, the dietitionor clinical psychologist, but rather the indivi-duals who function (medical technologists excepted)as aides and assistants. The examples are notinaccurate -- these professionals are Allied Healthpractitioners; they are, however, not nearly as representative of the Allied Health fields as other choices would be.Let us cite just one example of the unfortunate effectsof the present definition's inappropriateness: The AmericanSpeech-Language-Hearing Association has long suggested to itsmembers that they should not seek federal training assistance 33r) 326 14/ under the Part G Allied Health authorities of Title VII.

Among other things, the bill (S.2375)contained a proposed amendment to section 795 of the PublicService Act.Under the amendment,... subsection (1) would be changed to read:\"The term'Allied Health personnel' re atescience, withresponsibility for the delivery of health careor health care related services (Includingservices related to the identification,evaluation and prevention of diseases anddisorders, dietary and nutrition services,health promotion, rehabilitation, andhealth systems management), but who, 33p 327 15/ ..

We, therefore, recommendthat theCommittee adopt an amendment to section 702(a) ofthe Act that wouldadd representatives of Allied Health schools(and of the student bodies of such institu-tions) to those health profession schoolrepresentatives presently listed in sectionru2 (a) of Title-NUL as members of theRational Advisory Council on neaanProfessions Education. 3 3 4 328 16/ 3.Data Collection in Allied Health: According to therecent reports of the Bureau of Health Professions and theNational Commission on Allied Health Education,* support fordata collection in Allied Health should be at the top ofthe federal government's Allied Health support agenda. Saysthe !Wort of the Bureau of Health Manpower:\"There are insufficient data about allied healthpersonnel at the local, State, or national levelto permit radical improvements in planning, pro-duction, and management. The large number ofoccupations and functions involved, and theirinterrelations, makes good planning for alliedhealth personnel difficult. Improved data onproduction, recruitment, reimbursement, utilization,service cost, and work force quality are needed.Data on improvements in supply, work fortequality, educational standards and methods, andopportunities for minorities are difficultand costly to produce and generally less thansatisfactory.Where improvements have occurred,Federal support appears to be s decisive factor.\"According to the National Commission:\"The federal government should support thesystematic and continuous collection anddissemination of data on the numbers anddistribution of health manpower in alloccupational areas, including information onprojected openings. Support also should bemade available for the continuation ofbiennial national inventories of AlliedHealth programs, expanded to include allsettings which offer formal post-secogaIryeducation programs.\"The Commission's emphasis on data collection from \"alloccupational areas (and) settings which offer formal post- *The Future of Allied Health Education, Jossey-Bass, Publisher1San Francisco), 1980. 335 329 17/ secondary education programs\" merits special note. At present,the federal government supports Allied Health related datacollection which relates only to Allied Health schools definedin existing section 795 (2) -- i.e., schools which award theassociate or baccalaureate or higher degree. There is, however,a large number of certificate-awarding Allied Health institu-tions (and an increasing number of Allied Health aide, assist-ant, and orderly-type graduates of such schools) regardingwhich data are not being collected. Clearly, this data needto be gathered and analyzed. Such data should be and, wewould urge, can be gathered without altering in any way thestatutory definition of the Allied Health schools which areappropriate recipients of federal training support.There also is a pressing need for feasibility studieson the collection of data relating to ethnic minority-groupmember involvement in Allied Health training and practice.Data on approaches to career counseling, recruitment, admis-sions, and retention of minority-group students in trainingprograms are required, so that we can understand (and dealwith) the reality of greater student involvement at lowerlevels of training. We also need definitive studies on theimpact of minority institutions on the overall Allied Healthmanpower pool and on the reasons for unique minority-groupmember practice patterns and geographic distribution.In view of the foregoing, the Coalition asks theCommittee to -- 33o 330 18/ either amend the existing data-collection language ofor_add a new_section to Part G to accommo- datt the teed for the collection of AlliedHealth related data from schools of Allied Health (inclaNipost-secondary nonprofit and Proprietary institutions which grant practice \"certificates\" in Allied Health disciplines), including data relat- IngLto production recruitment reimbursement, atiliationseryisecdsts, workforce quality,oancationand methods, and opportuni-ties for minorities.4.Allied Health Project Support: Existing section 796authorizes grants and contracts to \"eligible entities\" projects which are detailed in subsection section.With one notable exception (i.e., projects toestablish \"new roles and functions of allied healthpersonnel\"),the purposes of section 796 should be retained in the Subcommittee's final 1 islative ro (\"sal. n at on, theoong pro ect-support emp ases should be added to chose ilrea enumerated:projects which focus on Allied Health role delinea- tions and related interdisciplinary curriculummodules; on meeting new health-service needs without creating new specialities; on the development of mechanisms for interdisciplinary articulation;on the use of Allied Health practitioners incontaining health-care costs; on the Allied Healthrelated needs of unserved underservedareas; and on curriculum offerings in healthpromotion, diseaie_prevention, gerafFIZTindhealth planning. The authorization levels for existinsection 796 should be $10 million forsca12,million for fiscal 1983,_514million for t seal 1984, and $16 million for fiscal 1985. 5.Training Institutes in Allied Health- Existing section 797authorizes grants for the conduct of short-term \"institutes\"generally designed to accomodate the \"advanced\" learningneeds of Allied Health practitioners who, principally as a 337 331 19/ result of the rapid expansion of the Allied Health fieldsand increases in the numbers and varieties of Allied Healthopportunities and initiatives, find themselves in neweducational, supervisory or administrative settings. TheSociety believes that this emphasis should be continued and,therefore, recommends that the final Committee proposalshould --include existing section 797 through fiscalyear 1985 at an annual authorization levelthat is no less than 41.5 million. 6Ethnic Minority-Group Allied Health Education: Asthe National Commission on Allied Health Education pointsout, the Allied Health professions, because they are amongthe few professions IA the economy for which the employmentoutlook is almost uniformly favorable. \"represent an excellentavenue for social mobility\" on the part of ethnic minority-group members. Moreover, notes the Commission, \"minoritiesare substantially underrepresented in educational programsfor the relatively high-level Allied Health occupations(i.e., baccalaureate and advanced degree levels).\" MinorityAllied Health training programs also are underrepresentedamong programs receiving Allied Health training assistance fromthe federal government. In the last year for which data areavailable (1975), the 563 Allied Health discipline programssituated in minority institutions represented 10 percentof the total Allied Health program offerings. Yet minorityinstitutions received only six percent of Allied Health training 33 Ls www0 20/ assistance made available through the Bureau of HealthProfessions.The Society asks that the Committee includein its final legislative proposal authorizations designed toprovide student support for disadvantaged ethnicminority-group members enrolled in Allied Healtheducation programs (especially in baccalaureateand graduate programs), and special programsupport tor Allied Health programs in traditionally and predominantly minorityinstitutions.In addition, the special. recruit-ment and related hawsexisting (T)..amUTVxtesititannual authorizationlevel of no less thila Mt.

The traditional emphasis of osteopathic medicine on family/general practicein the medically underserved regions of this nation is perhaps the only systematiceffort in the private sector toward this goal ever undertaken. The osteopathic professioncurrently deploys 67 percent of Its manpower in the nation's largest and smallest communities, the areas of greatest need: 50.5 percent in communities of 50,000 or less and 16.9 percent in communities of 500,000 or more.Another area of national concern the rising cost of health services has likewise been a matter of importance to osteopathic physicians in terms of their practicepatterns and hospital utilization. The profession's continuing emphasis on community-based ambulatory care as the preferred locus of treatment has over the years perpetuateda model of efficiency and cost-effectiveness.In short, osteopathicmedicine has demonstrated a record of responsiveness to nationalhealth care needs and goals long before they were articulated in federal policy, andover the years has developed considerable expertise in assuring all Americans accessto timely, pertinent, quality primary health care.Many of our successes can be directly attributed to the impact of P.L. 94-484. Lackingthe impetus of federal assistance, itis doubtfulour colleges could have embarkedupon the dramatic development and expansion efforts necessary to address the acutegeographical and specialty maldistribution problems which still characterize health carein this country. We have watched with growing frustration repeated attempts to erodeor eradicate precisely that federal support which has made possible many of the mostsignificant and effective responses by the health professions educational community tonational health priorities.It would be disingenuous of us to ignore the straitened nature of the federal budgetnow under consideration, or to minimize the importance of exercising selective fiscalrestraintin setting federal expenditures for health professions education, as for allother aspects of the economy. However, opponents of such support are equallydisingenuous in supposing that by taking the proverbial meat-ax to those programscurrently funded under P.L. 94-484 significant and in some cases ircversible damagewill not be done to the scope and quality of training programs. The false economy of an indiscriminate approach to fixing programsand authonzations is all too readilyapparent.Not only will the functional capabilities of the health professions schoolsbe seriously impaired, but as tuitions are forced upward to compensate for lost federalfunding, students will be driven even more deeply into debts which they will have tomeet through higher patient charges. Thus, while the short-term impact of a massive -I- 340 retrenchment in federal assistance will disadvantage educational programs and facilities, the long-range consequences are more far-reaching, potentially affecting every health care consumer by pushing the cost of services well beyond current limits.The following remarks highlight those programmatic and conceptual areas of particular importance to the osteopathic educational community: student financial assistance, institutional support, minority education, faculty development, and primary care training at both predoctoral and postdoctoral levels. -2- 3,17 341 1.STUDENT have t.een highly successful mech- anisms for assuring the availability of an adequate practitioner supply while permitting students to enter the health manpower work force regardless of economic status. During the academic year 1979-80 nearlyone-third ofallosteopathic students participated in federal scholarship programs, and more than SO percent were recipients of federally guaranteed or subsidized loans. Without such support student debt loans and with them, health care costs will skyrocket, and economics rather than talent will determine the composition of the student pool, to the detriment of both quality and equality of opportunity.We advocate a pluralistic mix of scholarship, subsidized loan, and conventional loan programs which will enable students to elect the method of financing their education most compatible with their individual economic circumstances. We are particularly supportive of the following initiatives.A.National Health Service Corps; NEW Scholarthip ProgramThe National Health Service Corps and its scholarship program have been extremely effective in channeling students into geographical and specialty shortage areas while minimizing economic discrimination. Consistent with osteopathic medicine's traditionalemphasis on community-based practice, a disproportionately large number of osteopathic students are currently recipients of NHSC scholarships or practicing members of the Corps; and the NHSC scholarship program has proved a student support mechanism singularly appropriate to the practice pattern of the majority of osteopathic physicians. We are therefore considerably distressed at the proposed phasedown of the NHSC scholarship component underlying its transfer to Title III, for a significant reduction in Corps field strength to save dollars in the short term will more than likely result in severe practitioner shortages in underserved areas for many years to come. Moreover, given the proposed elimination of the scholarship program for exceptionally financially needy students, the Corps represents the only other funding alternativeavailable to many individuals in this category. Any reduction in the scholarship program will inevitably affect this most needy population first and most severely.A second problem in transferring Sections 751-757 intact involves perpetuation of the three-year limitation on deferrals for graduate medical students under Section 752 0:0 (5) (A) of current law, a requirement which discriminates against osteopathic medical education.All osteopathic students are required to undertake a one-year rotating internship in addition to any residency program they may elect to pursue, thus effectively extending their graduate training to four years rather than the three common to allopathic education. The need to accommodate this unique feature of the osteopathic educational model was recently addressed through the addition of language providing for Secretarial discretion in granting deferrals exceeding three years under \"The Nurse Training Amendments of 1979,\" P.L. 96-76, Section 202, and more recently in Section 205(d)(1)(13) of H.R. 2004, which extends to four years the deferral option under the HEAL program.We trust that this problem can be resdlved in the language of the new law rather than through post facto amendment. - 3 3 .1 342 B.Health Professions Student Loan ProgramWe are highly supportive of the retention of the Health Professions Student LoanProgram, the most demonstrably successful health-oriented federal loan program nowin operation.This program, the most popular of the student assistance options undercurrent law, has just begun to recapitalize on the basis of loan repayments, and earlyindications point to an unusually low default rate (less than 2 percent). However, the absence of a new authorization will create an insurmountable hardship for recently-established schools which, due to the lack of a payback reserve, do not have adequatefunds to rollover into new loans. We recommend two solutions: (l) provide a seed authorization for formula distribution to new schools only, or (2) recall all federalHPSL funds and reapportion them on a formula basis to all schools. The extension of a proven loan program such as this to every health professions educational institutionon a equitable basis must be viewed as a priority if freedom of career choice regardlessof economic status is to be assured.C.Health Education Assistance Loan ProgramContinuation ofthe HEAL program atborrowing ceilingsconsistentwith actual educational cost is welcome, and we predict greatly expanded utilization of this programbyhealthprofessionsstudentsinthe coming years.Regrettably, however,the reauthorization proposal as articulated in S. 799 tails to address the three-year deferrallimitation for graduate study under el.. 94-484 (Section 731 (a)(2)(C)60. As in the case of the NHSC scholarship program, a threeyear deferral fails to accommodate therotating internship required of all osteopathic students. An extension of the deferral period to four years would remedy the discriminatory focus of current law and byallowing the majority of osteopathic students to complete their residency trainingbefore entering upon a loan repayment program. U. INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT In the past Congress has provided support to institutions educating health professionalsto encourage the production of additional manpower to meet national needs. These flexible, nonprogrammatic funds have been used to insure the continuity, quality, andresponsivenessofhealthprofessionseducationtofederalgoals,and have been instrumental in holding tuition costs to the lowest possible level consistent with themaintenance of institutional viability. This last pointis particularly important, for higher tuition will inevitably lead to higher patient care costs when students enterpractice and begin to repay their educational debts. Moreover, significant tuitionincreases will effectively preclude disadvantaged students from entering careers in thehealth professions,therebyimposing discriminatory economic constraints on the composition of the practitioner pool.With respect to osteopathic medical education there are other problems as well. Severalnew osteopathic colleges have arisen in response to the discrete demand for distinctively -4- 3 19 343 osteopathic care and the general demand for additional primary care physicians. Many of these new schools depend on institutional support to offset some portion of theunusually heavy expenses incurred during the developmental phase of an institution'slife.The established osteopathic colleges are also uniquely in need of this form ofassistance, for unlike most health professions schools, the majority of them are notattached to large educational complexes whose shared resources help hold operationalcosts to a minimum.Likewise, because our schools concentrate on preparing primarycare physicians to enter practice at the earliest opportunity, their research componentand its attendent benefits relative to the acquisition of permanent facilities, faculty,and overhead offsetsis necessarily limited.These colleges rely heavily on the flexible nature of Institutional support to assist them in initiating creative programsin nutrition education, patient education, remotesite training, and similar educt.tionalactivities consistent with federal goals.Our schools have been actively seeking alternative sources of income to counterbalancethe expected reorientation of federal priorities away from this type of support. However,this process has been slow and, given the critical state of the American economy, toooften without tangible issue. Additional time and a continued, if reduced, federalcommitment to institutional fund.ng are needed if the health professions schools are to free themselves of federal dependency in this area. We believe institutional coresupport should be continued, but we also realize that Congress may wish to effectsignificant changes in both the direction and scope of such support. We therefore recommend thatif current funding is to cease, withdrawal of the federal presenceshould be accomplished in a phased manner so as to minimize the disruption whichtermination of these funds will inevitably cause. In this regard it would be both useful and relevant to undertake an impact study under Section 107(c)(3) of this bill to determine the effect of eliminating such support upon institutional stability, curricularscope, content and quality. faculty recruitment and retention, and student charges andservices.Health professions educational institutions are national resources deservingof national support, preferably through a program which recognizes colleges having aproven record of producing primary care practitioners, and which encourages schoolsnot having such a record to revise their curricula accordingly. We stand ready towork with this Subcommittee to develop a mechanism which will assure needed coresupport while simultaneously reinforcing the goal of educating more primary carepracitioners to serve the needs of the American people. IR.SPECIAL PROJECTS A.Family MedicineWe are delighted to find inchided in S. 799 a provision extending grants to departmentsof family medicine, and to note therein language authorizing projects to improveadministrative academic units already in place. To insure that existing depts receive an adequate share of funds under this program, we recommend that report languagebe drafted so as to emphasize the Congressional intent to distribute these funds equitably for the improvement of current programs as well as the creation of newones.-5 - 30.i 1 344 B.Training Grants in Family Medicine, General Internal Medicine, and GeneralPediatricsWhile we are pleased that S. 799 recognizes the need to augment the production ofprimary care practitioners to offset current and projected manpower shortages, we aredismayed to observe an overwhelming bias in favor of graduate education. As has already been noted, osteopathic physicians, over 90% of whom are primary carepractitioners, are trained under a didactic model which delivers the bulk of its academicand clinical education in general practice at the predoctoral level. In combiningpredoctoral primary care training and faculty development under a single authorization,the two components geared specifically toward undergraduate medical education areeffectively pitted against each other in a zero-sum game from which neither canbenefit except at the expense of the other. Internship and residency programs arenot similarly handicapped, an inequity made more trenchant by the considerable disparitybetween the ;26 million authorized for graduate training and the $6 million allocatedto both predoctoral and faculty development programs. The importance of adequate support for both these activities is self-evident; what should be emphasized here isthat funds authorized for these purposes will ultimately benefit all medical students,not merely the few who choose to undertake residencies in primary care specialities.We urge the Committee to create separate authorizations for predoctoral and facultydevelopment programs(Subsections(3)and(4)respectively),andtoadjustthedisproportionately large authorizations for postgraduate programs to reflect a moreequitable distributior of funds for undergraduate as well as graduate medical education.With respect to Subsection (3) in particular, we are fearful that the \"plan, develop,and operate\" language Implies that new programs alone are eligible for funding, andthat projects designed to maintair. or improve existing programs may be consideredineligible because the planning and development phases of their operation have alreadybeen implemented.We recommend that the language of this section be revised toread, \"plan, develop, operate,\" a distinction which would clarify the application of thisprovision considerably.Relative to this same section, we suggest expansion of the\"medical students\" language to include both \"medical and osteopathic students,\" aclarification without which osteopathic institutions may be precluded from applying forprogram funds.C.Disadvantaged AssistanceWe wholeheartedly endorse reauthorization of the disadvantaged assistance program.Although the colleges of osteopathic medicine have been consistently supportive ofspecial efforts directed toward disadvantaged students, the limited funding made available under this authority in the past has been insufficient to create the desiredeffect.This stricture is especially severe in the case of programs targeted at theattraction and retention of minority students. Particularly in the case of small schools lacking affiliation with a large university system, the availability of faculty to providethe necessary counseling, remedial, and socialization support cannot be guaranteedwithout increased access to the requisite funding. In the absence of one or more full-time staff members committed solely to overseeing the various aspects of theproposed program, responsibility for operatingitwill devolve upon staff members already overworked, with predictably dissatisfying results. 351t-6 345 Despite chrome underfundinc,, programs such as the Health Careers Opportunities Program (HCOP) have managed to produce impressive results.Through a HCOP grant the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine has established an Office of Special Opportunities (OSO) to increase the representation of ethnic disadvantaged students incolleges of osteopathic medicine. Administered in cooperation with a consortium composed of the fifteen colleges of osteopathic medicine, the program provides a variety of services to individual schools to stimulate local initiatives such as undergraduate recruitment, summer preceptorships, pre- and post-admission academic reinforcement and peer counseling. Through the OSO a national osteopathic career information service has been made available to students, counselors, and advisors at both secondary and predoctoral levels. A recent review of applicant and enrollment statistics for our schools indicates a significant positive demographic shift, attributable in large measure to HCOP's role in assisting osteopathic institutions to recruit and retainminority students.The percentage of minority applicants to colleges of osteopathic medicine has risen from 4.5% in 1975 to more than 9% in 1981.First-year enrollments of minorities have likewise increased, from 5.7% in 1975 to 6.8% in 1980.The HCOP approach clearly works; but if minority recruitment and retention activities are to register more than token gains, federal participation must be augmented.The $18 million authorization proposed in S. 799 is insufficient even to meet current commitments, much less provide for increased activity. As it is estimated that increases over the current $19.5 appropriation of $4 million and $6 million respectively will be required tomaintain the current level of effort during FY 1983 and F11984, we recommend raising the proposed authorization levels to $20 million, $23.5 million, and $25.5 million for the next three fiscal years.D.Remote -bite TrainingWe are deeply disappointed that S. 799 fails to include meaningful support for predoctoral clinical training in areas remote from the main campus, particularly those located in medically underserved areas. One factor responsible forthe marked success of osteopathic medicinein attracting and retaining practitioners in underserved com- munities has been the exposure of students early and repeatedly during their clinical training to practice in remote-site ambulatory settings; yet to date little federal support has been forthcoming for this training modality. While we are appreciative of the attempt embodied in Section 782 to provide for placement of students with preceptors in the field, the thrust of this section is clearly toward the provision of support services and not toward the creation of clinical experiences congruent with the fundamentally educational goals and objectives of this legislative proposal. Moreover, many of the support services covered by this provision are already available to members of the National Health Service Corps and individuals who have elected the NHSC private practice option under Title IP of the Public Health Service Act.This potential duplication of services seems unaccountably wasteful, particularly when the predoctoral clinical(i.e., educational) component of the proposal has been granted only the most token recognition.During the 96th Congress, both S. 2144 and later S.2375 as finally approved by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources contained a provision (Section 784 of S. 2375) which spoke effectively to the need to provide remote-site training as well as support services in underserved areas. (Appendix A)As itappears in S. 799, only the latter half of that original proposal the subsection dealing with support services has been adopted. We urge you to reintegrate the missing component of that earlier provision, directed specifically toward remote-site training support, into S. 799. -7 346 Such a provisionis clearly educational in nature, and thus appropriately within thescope of health professions education reauthorizing legislation. Remote-site training support will enhance the production of Primary care physicians, particularly for practicein underserved areas, assist schools in their transition away from dependence uponcapitation funding, and encourage increased use of community-based facilities fortraining and service delivery. The proposal has an established and approved legislativehistory,and arationale amply provided inreport language accompanying S. 2375 (Appendix B).Finally, the proposal is reasonable, given the thrust of S. 799 towardalleviating primary care malchstribution problems, and iseasily implemented and administered.While remote-site training is unquestionalby a cost-effective activityboth in terms of providing direct services in shortage areas and developing practitionersinterested in making a long-term career commitment to this type of practice, IL willrequire federal assistance if it is to continue to grow.E. Area Health Education CentersAs a condition of eligibility for AHEC status under current law (Section 781(d)(2)(A),each qualifying center must enroll at least six individuals in a family medicine or general internal medicine residency program. This provisionfails to recognize the unique primary caretraining emphasis of the predoctoral osteopathic curriculum.Because the necessity of completing a residency in family medicine or general internalmedicine is largely obviated by the heavy emphasis on primary care education in theundergraduate program and during the required rotating internship, relatively few osteopathic physicians undertake further postdoctoral training in these areas unlessthey are interested in an academic career. The osteopethic family medicine residency programis a recent innovation,still inits developmental phase and consequently enrolling only a small number of participants at this time. To require of osteopathicallyaffiliated programs the same level of quantitative complicnce as allopathic programs clearly discriminates against an alternate but equally valid training model. We proposethat in order to rectify the fundamental inequity of the law as currently constituted,the numerical requirement relative to primary care residencies be waived in the caseof an AHEC affiliated with an osteopathic college.F.Curriculum Developm.ntCurriculum development activities supported under Section 788(d) perhapsthe single most cost-beneficial program under P.L. 94-484, assuring the continuedflexibility and relevance of medical education for a relatively small federal investmentwhile helping the health professions schools expand their academic capabilities in areasrelevantto national needs.Since itsinception the program has generated many innovative advances in medical education and practice, despite minimal appropriations.The failure to reauthorize this invaluable program within the context of S. 199 is thusparticularly disappointing, as there continues to exist a demonstrable need to encouragecurriculumexpansioninnutrition,geriatrics,humanisticmedicine,theethical implications of biomedical research, rr iodo:ogles of cost-effective medical practice, and a variety of other issues of nationa, ...uncern.

However, the indiscriminate erasure of many programs, and the crippling by token finding of others as proposed here, will without question be detrimental to the educational process.We urge the Committee to revise S. 799 in such a way as to preserve a comprehensive federal commitment to training the Individuals who will deliver health care to the American people for many years to come. :3 ' 83-520 0-81---23 r-348 Appendix A (I) Section 784 is amended to read as follows:\"REMOTE SITE TRAINING AND SUPPORTSERVICES IN UNDERSERVED AREAS\"SEC. 784.

The Committee believes that these decentralized educationalprograms, if properly implemented, can provide health professionsstudents with important knowledge and attitudes so that they willprovide community responsive health care. Hopefully, students whohave received a portion of their training in such settings can becomeacclimated to providing health care less dependent on the tertiaryresources available in academic health science 'centers. This acclima-tion, may, m turn, encourage students to consider careers of service tothe underserved. An additional benefit to the provision of clinicaleducation in geographically remote sites where underserved popula-tions reside is an increase in the availability of practitioners just byvirtue of the conduct of these educational program. Faculty, associatedhealth professionals, and staff will more than likely be located in suchareas in order to conduct the contemplated educational programs. Thismigration has been witnessed in the initiation of a number of areahealth education centers. Although the faculty is available for teach-ing students, they are also, in the clinical setting, treating patients.Once the critical mass of health professionals is located in a previouslyunderserved area, they may well attract other professionals, as severalstudies have demonstrated.As important as attracting health professionals to underserved areasis keeping them there. Professional isolation has been cited as one ofthe reasons why health professicnalr will not remain in communitiesin which there are few colleagues. Consultation and referral services,students educational programs. locum tenens and continuing educationprograms may all assist in creating a professional environment attrac-tive to health providers.Therefore, the Committee has provided new authority for the sup-port of clinical training programs in areas that are geographically re-mote from the main teaching facilities of the schools and that are med-ically underserved. Tne Committee bill also authorizes funding forthe provision of support services to health professionals who are prac-ticing in health manpower shortaet areas. Because area health edu-cation centers supported under Section 781 are to carry out suchactivities in order to receive support under that authority, the Com-mittee has precluded such centers from receiving support under Sec-tion 781 concurrently. The Committee expects the Secretary, to givepriority to those projects which will conduct clinical education pro-grams. and provide support services to piofe:sionals, in undereeredareas unlikely to be ser%ed b) an area health education center in theforeseeable future. The new authorit% under section 784 constitutes arecognition that two important functions served by AHEC; that is,remote site tranring and support services to practitioners, are worthyof encouragement in their own sight. ei en apart from the comprehen-sive accnmplishments achieved by A I rECs. 3 ;7 351 TESTIMONYOF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF NURSE-MIDWIVES Summary 1. A certified nurse-midwife Is an individual educated in the two disciplinesof nursing and midwifery, who p idence of certification accordingto the requirements of the American College of Nurse-Midwives. 2. All certified nurse-oiduives are nurses who have completed an accreditedprogram of education in midwifery, at least 15 of 4:Itch are funded by theNurse Training Act, from both Nurse Practitioner and Advanced Nurse Training funds.3. Nurse - midwives have been in the U.S. since 1925 and have increased rapidlyin the last twenty years because the federal government and childbearingfamilies support nurse-midwifery care.. The federal government has a long history of support for nurse-midwiferyeducation and practice and nurse-midwives are an integral partof many health care projects for the medically indigent. S. Nurse-midwives have a demonstrated ability to reduce Infant morbidity andmortality and improve pregnancy outcome. 6. Nurse-midwifery care has been shown to be cost effective for a variety ofreasons. 7. Nurse - midwifery education programs are planning to become financiallyself-sufficient but will need further federal help; considerable physicianresistance to expansion of nurse-midwifery services hinders these plans. 8. The American College of Nurse-Midwives suggests that funding nurse-midwifery education is a vise investment for the U.S. Congress and offers several recommendations for continuing federal support (or nurse-midwifery education. April IS, 1980Committee on Labor and Human ResourcesU.S. Senate 352 The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) is the professionalorganization of Certified Nurse-Midwives (CNMs) United States,representing 85Z of all CAlis. The ACNM is autonomous from all otherprofessional organizations and speaks for its membership on all issuesaffecting the practice, education, recognition, legislation and economicsof nurse-midwifery. The ACNI1 collaborates with other professional groupswhich share its primary concern of quality maternal and infant health carefor women and babies, and is recognized as an advocate for maternal andchild health Care issues.According to the official ACtai definition. \"A certified nurse-midwifeis an individual educated in the two disciplines of nursing and midwifery,who possesses evidence of certification according to the requirements ofthe American College of Nurse- Midwives. Nurse-midwifery practice is theindependent =Amazement of care of normal newborns and women,antepartally, intrapartally, postpartally and/or gynecologically. Thisoccurs within a health care system which provides for medical consultation,collaborative management, and referral and is in accord with the 'Fu:A.tions,Standards and Qualifications for Nurse-Midwifery Practice' as defined bythe ACNM.\" There are approximately 2,200 curse-midwives in the United States,andapproximately 220 more graduate each year. Most nurse-midwivespractice in association with institutions such as hospitals, c1inkcs,And birthing centers. A small number offer home birth services. In1976-1977, rase-midwives did approximately one percent of all birthsin the U.S. To become a professional nurse-midwife in the United States, onemost first study nursing, and then usually practice nursing for one year inthe field of maternal and infant health . The future nurse-midwife then appliesto a nurse-midwifery educational program. Alttough all of these programs areassociated with major universities, some are part of a Master's Degree program.and others grant a certificate rather than a degree. Both kinds of programsoffer nurse-midwifery education which prepares the student nurse-midwife forclinical practice. Students in Master's programs also receive 'urther educationin public health or nursing. Students who successfully complete their educationalprograms are eligible to rake the American College of Nurse-Midwives' certificationexamination.Those who pass the examination are certified as nurse-midwives - C'ls.All nurse-midwifery program are accredited by the Division of Accreditation ofthe ACNM. 353 2 prepares the student nurse-midwife for clinical practice. Students inMaster's programs also receive further education in public health ornursing.Students who successfully complete their educational programsare eligible to take the American College of Nurse-Midwives. certificationexamination.Those who pass the examination are certified as nurse -midwives - CNMa. All nurse-midwifery programs are accredited by theDivision of Accreditation of the ACNM. Until the last decades of the 19th century, childbirth was in thehands of women. Midwives practiced an art and science passed fromwoman to woman. Mothers gave birth at home, surrounded by femalefriends and relatives, attended by a midwife who usually was also afriend or relative. A number of factors, including the rise of themedical profession, the growth of the public health movement, a trendtoward limiting family size, the political vulnerability of midwivesand their clients, the high infant and maternal mortality rates, andthe severe decrease of immigration during and after World War I, com-bined to virtually eliminate traditional birth attendants and to movebirth from the home to the hospital by the early 1900s. Maternal andchild health became a national political issue when, during World WarI, one third of all men were found physically unfit for military serviceand one half of those were thought to have suffered from poor maternaland child care. This experience during World War I and the politicalstrength of newly enfranchised women brought about the passage of theSheppard-Towner Act in 1921, creating the first infusion of federaldollars into maternal and child health care. In 1925, Mary Breckinridge,an American nurse educated in midwifery in England, established theKentucky Committee for Mothers and Babies. A native Kentuckian, MaryBreckinridge became the country's first nurse-midwife and the committeebecame the Frontier Nursing Service, providing care for mothers andbabies in mountainous, isolated Eastern Kentucky. Like the earliermidwives, nurse-midwives support the natural processes of health birthwith watchful expectancy and emotional support. Unlike the midwifeof past centuries, the certified nurse-midwife comes to her work afterrigorous education offered by prestigious universities, bringing ascientific basis to her practice and an ability to identify and respondto deviations from the normal course of childbearing.The number of nurse-midwives increased slowly between 1931, whenthe Maternity Center Association in New York opened the first nurse-midwiferyeducation program, and 1970. By 1970, approximately 600 people had graduatedfrom U.S. schools of nurse-midwifery. In the last 10 years the number ofschools has doubled to more than 20 and an additional 1,600 nurse-midwiveshave graduated. Families' commitment to prepared childbirth, the assertionof consumers' rights and the resurgence of feminism have spurred a tremendousinterest in nurse-midwifery care among consumers in the last decade.Consumers are demanding care which offers them decision-making powerand reasonable options in childbearing. Meticulous screening through-out pregnancy and birth, combined with freely shared information andcontinuit, of care, are the hallmarks of nurse-midwifery care. Inaddition, because of the eniquely female nature of childbearing, some .36 354 3 women seek nurse-midwifery care in order to receive care from women. In the last 20 years, women have acquired the education and strength to make changes in the health care system and nurse-midwifery has grown enough to be able to respond significantly to the demands women andtheir families make of health care providers. Consumers have been most vocal and ardent in their support of nurse-midwifery.Only since the 1910's have professional midwifery services, whichhave long been available to women of all classes in other countries,been available to economically affluent women in the United States. Nurse-midwives are responding to increasing demands for nurse-midwiferycare from affluent women by participating in a variety of private sector settings. The federal government has a long history of support for nurse- midwifery.Several federal agencies rely heavily on nurse-midwives to provide care in their programs -- the Indian Health Service,. Rural Health Clinics, the Maternal and Infant Care Projects, the National Health Service Corps, Improved Pregnancy Outcome projects, Adolescent Pregnancy Projects, and the Army, Air Force and Navy. Nurse-midwives receive directreimbursement for services to military families under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CRAMPUS) and, thanks to diligent work on the part of the members of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and to Senator Daniel Inouye, nurse-midwives will sonn begin to be reimbursed for services to Medicaid clients.Several recent federal government reports support nurse-midwiferypractice.The Graduate Medical Education Advisory Committee's reportrecormended that nurse-midwives be doing 5 percent of all normal deliveries in the United States by 1990 and that federal support fornurse-midwifery education remain at its current level.2 The currentoutput of educational programs is not sufficient, however, to meet thatgoal. The report on necessary maternal and infant health services pre- pared for the Select Panel for the Promotion of Child Health focuses on nurse-midwifery services.3 The General Accounting Office's report, \"Better Management and MoreResources Needed to Strengthen Federal Efforts to Improve Pregnancy Outcome\"describes nurse-midwives' effectiveness in delivering care to low incomefamilies.The report observes that \"although HEW has endorsed use ofnurse-midwives, the Health Services Administration has not agressivelypromoted use of nurse-midwives in its programs \"The CAO recommended that \"...HEW encourage a greater use of nurse-midwife obstetrician teams, help eliminate barriers which precludenurse-midwives from practicing in hospitals, and provide additionaltraining funds for nurse-midwives, by giving such training higher priorityfor use of existing funds and/or seeking additional funds from Congress.\"4HEW agreed that better training and practice opportunities are needed for nurse midwives and promised to convene a working group of HEW 361 355 4 operating agenices to develop by March 1980 a plan to promote greateruse of nurse-midwives. This plan has not yet been developed, however,the working group has held one meeting and two consultations with nurse-idwives. The safety of nurse-midwifery care has been well established. At ahearing held December 18, 1980, by the Subcommittee on Oversight andInvestigation of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, notedepidemiologist, C. Arden Miller said, All of the studies I know confirmthat the health benefits of care as rendered by nurse-midwives standup to scientific scrutiny exceedingly well.\" He added that many of theinterventions routinely used in obstetrics today have been subjected toa scientific scrutiny which \"...is in many respects less rigorous thanthe scrutiny to which the midwife's services are subjected.\" 5 Aconsiderable body of research documents the safety of nurse-midwiferycare. All studies have shown that the risk to women attended by nurse-midwives is equal to or lower than the risk to comparable groups ofwomen attended by physicians. In fact, the literature reports instance&of striking reductions in infant mortality rates after introduction ofnurse-midwifery care. Since its beginning in eastern Kentucky, nurse-midwifery care hasbeen introduced to other medically underserved areas characterized bypoverty, geographical isolation and other social factors associated withpoor obstetrical outcomes. Nurse-midwives screen carefully for indicationsof medical problems and collaborate closely with physicians when compli-cations arise, thus identifying clients who are essentially medicallynormal from among the population characterized by social risk factors.Nurse-midwifery care has been shown to increase utilization of prenatalcare, lower infant mortality and morbidity and to increase maternal well-being among these populations.At the Frontier Nursing Service \"...the maternal mortality ratesaveraged 9.1 per 10,000 births from 1925-1951; among white women nation -vide the maternal mortality rate was 34 per 10,000. Since 1951, the FNShas not lost a single mother to birth related causes. FNS neonatalmortality rates in the years 1952-1954 were 17.3 per 1,000 -- less thanthe rest of Kentucky and the United States. Since 1971 the FNS perinatalmortality rates have averaged only 6 per 1,000 which is less than halfthe average of the rest of the country, even in its best year (14.5 in1977), and better than the best country in the world, Sweden. TheMetropolitan Life Insurance Company of New Tork estimated in a reportin 1932 that if services like the FNS were adopted nationwide, theperinatal mortalities of the time would be reduced by 60,000 per year.6Nurse-midwifery services in other rural areas, especially in the Southand Southwest, have produced similar improvements in pregnancy outcome.The Medical Mission Sisters founded the Catholic Maternity Institute in1943 to serve the impoverished mothers of Santa Fe County, New Mexico.The Sisters offered prenatal care and births at their Childbearing Center.Many births also took place in adobe homes with no electricity or running 36c 356 5 water.Prior to the program, in 1939, perinatal death rate of Santa Fe County were 87.6 per 1,000. By 1967 it had been reduced to 15.1, a level of achievement not to be attained by the country at large until over 10 years later.At that time, in 1967, the perinatal mortality rates of the United State* were 22.1 per 1,000, while in New Mexico it was even higher i at 24.8...\" In the early 1960's a CNN practice was established as a pilot project in Madera County, California. Special legislation made nurse-midwiferylegal for the duration of the project. Certified nurse-midwives were introduced as the only new variable in the medically understaffed county's health core system. The mothers served by the project were primarilyagricultural workers. During the first 18 months of the project, the Madera County pre- maturity rate dropped from its previous level of eleven percent to 6.6 percent and the neonatal mortality rate dropped from 23.9 deaths per 1,000 live births to 10.3 deaths per 1,000 live births. There vas a significant increase in attendance at prenatal clinics during the pilot project.Mothers who had had no prenatal care and who were cared for during labor and delivery by nurse-midwives experienced a neonatal death rat. of 26.8 per 1,000 live births. The neonatal death rate for mothers who had no prenatal care was 50.6 per 1,000 live births after the project ended and nurse-midwifery care during labor vas no longer available.Despite these good results, the California Medical Society opposed legalization of nurse-midwifery and the nurse-midwives had to leave at the end of the project. After they left, the prematurity rate increased by almost 50 percent and the neonatal death rate tripled. 8In Holmes County, Mississippi, in 1971 the infant mortality rates had dropped from approximately 39 per 1,000 live births to 20 per 1,000 live births, two years after certified nurse-midwives began providing primary care to pregnant women as part of a community-wide focus on the health problems of mothers and babies. 9 A study by the University of Mississippi Medical Center between October 1, 19;2, and April 30, 1973, showed that nurse - midwifery clients kept 94 percent of scheduled appointments, compared with 80 percent of visits kept by clients of the house staff physicians. It should be noted that clients of both physicians and nurse-midwives did not see the same care providers at successive visits. Among the nurse-midwifery clients 82.6 per cent had normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries;, 62.1 percent of the house staff clients had normal spontaneous deliveries, with most of the difference found in the rate of low forcep deliveries by the house steff.'0At Su Clinica Familiar. a nurse-midwifery childbirth center in southern Texas, all maternity care for normal mothers is provided by certified nurse-midwives. The prematurity rate in 1974. two yearsafter nurse-midwifery began, was 3.5 percent. In the same year in Texas 363 357 6 the prematurity rate was 7.6 percent and for the nation it was 7.4 percent.The nurse-midwifery service has been operating since 1972. The clientsare Mexican- American and Mexican women who are primarily migrant workers. 11\"In 1976 a nurse-midwifery program was begun in Mississippi Countyin northeast Arkansas. In 1975, 80 percent of births had occurred undergeneral anesthesia in that county. In 1979 general anesthesia rates hadfallen to 12 percent, while perinatal mortalities also dropped dramatically. 12\"In 1941 the Tuskegee School of Nurse-Midwifery opened in Alabamaoffering services to the area. During the five years of its existence,neonatal mortality rates went from 46 per 1,000 live births to 14more thanthree-fold improvement.\"13Nurse-midwifery services have also resulted in lowered infantmortality and sorbidity rates among inner-city mothers.In 1931, the Maternity Center Association OICA) opened the LobenstineMidwifery Clinic to care for immigrant families in upper Manhattan tenements.Between 1931 and 1951, 5,765 mothers registered with the clinic, of which87 percent gave birth at home attended by (nurse- )midwives. Their maternalmortalities were less than one-third the national rates of the time. Theiraverage neonatal death rates were only 15 per 1,000 while that of New YorkCity as a whole ranged from 28.0 in 1931 to 18.4 in 1951.\" Kings CountyHospital, New York City, opened a nurse-midwifery service in 1976. In thefirst 884 birhts, they had a neonatal mortality rate of 7.9 per 1,000,reflecting the deaths of 7 premature babies.14At the North Central Bronx Hospital, whose clients come from one ofNew York's most distressed areas, where every patient receives nursingcare or nurse-midwifery management from nurse-midwives in labor, fromJanuary 1 to December 31, 1979, 88 percent of the mothers experiencednormal spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Less than 30 percent of allmothers needed analgesia or anesthesia in labor. The neonatal deathrate among infants 1,000 grams or over was 4.2 per 1,000. Since 1970, nurse-midwifery practice in the United States hasexpanded to include two additional special populations, adolescentsand economically affluent women. Adolescent childbearing carriessocial and medical risks which can often lead to poor obstetricaloutcomes.nurse-midwifery care, along with physician collaborationhas been effective, and has been shown to improve the outcomes ofteenage pregnancy.Between 1976 and 1977 at a clinic for teenagers in Lincoln Hospitalin New York City, nurse-midwifery care brought considerable improvementin outcome measures such as maternal weight gain and hematocrit. Therate of low birth-weight babies dropped from 18.1 percent to 6.3 percent.16The Office of Adolescent Pregnancy at the Department of Health and HumanServices has stressed inclusion of nurse-midwifery services in theprojects it funds. 3 358 7 The available data suggest that nurse-midwifery care is generally less expensive than traditional obstetrical care.The cost effectiveness and high quality of nurse-midwifery care are usefdl tools for Congress to use in its efforts to provide economic health care for mothers and babies who need to rely on public sector services. A study conducted in rural Georgia showed significant improvement in infant outcomes and a decrease lit health care expenditures after introduc- tion of nurse-midwifery care. 1'Nurse-midwifery care often opens the door to lowered costs through the use of non-hospital facilities, such as a birth center or the client's home, for normal births.The Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Greater New York audited the Childbearing Center started by the Maternity Center Association in New York City in 1976-1977. They found that care at the Childbearing Center cost 37.6 percent of in-hospital care, barring complications. The report also stated that the cost to Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Greater New York for families delivering at the Center was 66.1 percent of the cost to the plan had the family gone to the hospital, barring complications.The cost to the health care system of full care at the Center has decreased each year, from a high in 1976 of $2,016.46 to $1,046.17 in 1979, as utilization increased. The Childbearing Center staff expect the Center to be self-supporting with 600 families in the program annually. In late 1980 the Center had over 500 families enrolled and expected to meet their goal very shortly. Medicaid is currently paying from $1,649.53 to $2,230.04 for normal care with a three-day hospital stay in various New York hospitals. The Childbearing Center currently charges $1,000 for its whole package of prenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care; the Center receives $885 for total care from Medicaid and the Center is appealing that rate.The care at the Center is economical because clients have the opportunity for prolonged contact with professionals, including the nurse- midwives who are with them in labor and delivery. A client's stay at the Center is much shorter than the typical three-day stay and she receives intensive, personalized care during that time.The Center is also economical because non-hospital facilities, the Center and the client's homes are used as settings for provision of care. The Center's all inclusive fee of $1,000 compares favorably with the $3,000 for hospital and obstetric fees which private care in New York City can cost.18Another mechanism often associated with cost savings and midwifery care is the shortened hospital stay for a healthy mother and baby.Midwifery care during pregnancy and availability by phone or home visitduring the early postpartum period set the stage for the well-prepared family to go home within 12 to 24 hours after a normal labor and birth. 359 8 In Washington, D.C. the current cost of prenatal, delivery and post-partum care with a nurse-midwifery service is $.300 for clients planningto deliver in the hospital. This includes prenatal care, labor managementand delivery, postpartum care, a two week, six week, six months and oneyear checkup and three postpartum claeses. Physician's fees vary from$800 to $1,200 and include prenatal care, labor and delivery management,postpartum care, and a six weeks check-up. Hospital costs for nurse-midwifery clients who spend 6 hours or less in the hospital afterdelivering, are atound $600. Clients who stay the traditional threedays will pay close to $1,000 in hospital costs. Host nurse-midwives are employees who have no control over pricescharged to clients. As more nurse-midwives go into practice withphysicians and establish private nurse-midwifery practices, we will beginto be able to assess the financial impact of private nurse-midwiferypractice.OMITS began reimbursing nurse-midwives within the pastyear and is conducting a study of the impact of nurse - midwifery reimburse-ment on their maternity care costs.While the data are litited, several characteristics of nurse-midwiferypractice suggest that nurse-midwives deliver cost-effective care. Theaverage salary of a nurse-midwife in clinical practice in 1976 was $16,200.Contract this figure, which has certainly improved somewhat since 1976,with the median income of any obstetrician-gynecologist, which was $89,310 in 1979.Nurse-midwives' services have to cost employing institutionsless than obstetricians'.Nurse-midwives have a proven record in reducing infant morbidity andmortality.The reduction in prematurity and low birth weight rates in themany places nurse-midwives have worked certainly must also have meant areduction in dollars spent by states ..nd private companies on intensive carenurseries.An official of the University of Mississippi, Peter H. Meyers, hascompared the tax payers' cost for nurse-midwifery education with the savingsreaped through improved pregnancy outcomes.Looking at 76 graduates over a three-year period, I foundtheir median age to be 31. Assuming that on the average752 of them work until age 65, delivering 15 babies permonth and referring 5 others, I can anticipate that theywill provide primary care for 583,680 mothers, delivering437,760 habits.Using a very conservative cost for lifetime institutional-ization of $500,000 we Can Say that if only 4 out of583,680 babies have radically different outcome (familysupport rather than lifetime institutionalisation) thetaxpayer breaks even. The break-even is of babies avoidlifetime institutionalisation. I would, more realisticallyI believe, predict a savings to taxpayers of many hundredsof times the program's cost. 11=MillMIW6v 360 9 Cost effectiveness includes other costs such as thecost of delivering care, and the cost of nursingschool; but these costs are often borne in largemeasure or entirely by private parties.Nome of this deals with maternal or infantmortality or maternal morbidity. What are thesocial costs when a mother dies? Bow often do herchildren become temporary or permanent wards of thestate? What does that cost the taxpayer? I can'teven guess. 19 Nurse-midwives are educated to use technology only when it is indicatedby a client's condition. Such limited, rather than routine, use of machinesand laboratory tests should result in savings for individual customers.Nurse - midwifery clients often use less analgesia or anesthesia in labor.A Cesarean birth can add as such as $1,000 to a physician's fee andas much as $3,000 to hospital fees. Nurse-midwifery services have Cesareanbirth rates which are significantly lower than the U.S. rata which isapproaching 30 percent in many facilities. The Cesarean birth rate at thenurse-midwifery service at the North Central Bronx was approximately 13percent in 1979, for example. A nurse-eldvifery service would be less expensive for the federalgovernment to establish than a physician's practice because nurse-midwivesneed less complitated equipment. They need only to have access to hightechnology through their collaborating physician.In addition to potential cost savings, nurse-midwives bring to eachbirth s concern for the psychological and cultural factors which affect thebirth experience of the mother, family and infant. Ample research hasshown that the nature of the birth and immediate post-birth experiences havea strong impact on later infant-parent relationships. The evidence suggeststhat positiie birth experiences correlate with lover incidences of childneglect and abuse. Nurse-midwives strive to help parents create positivebirth experiences and this must make an indirect contribution to loweredfinancial ad emotional costs to society as a whole.The iiformation available and the logical conclusions drawn from exam-/notion of'nurse-midwifery practice prove that nurse-midwifery care is acost-effective means to providing safe, satisfying maternal and child healthtire. An investment in nurse-midwifery education is then, one which bringsgood returns to Congress and to American families. 3 6 7 361 10 At least 15 of the 25 nurse - midwifery education programs recive majorparts of their funding through the Nurse Training Act. It coats between S20,000and $30,000 to educate nurse-midwife; tuition for a master's degree programcan be almost 55,000 a year and the longest programs are two full years, includingthe summer aesester.Several programs have estimated that if federal funding were with-drawn, tuition would have to rise to between 322,000 to $30,000 tocompensate.Ranks would hesitate to give loans for such high tuitionbecause nurse-midwives' salaries do not make them attractive loancandidates.Other student aid resources are not sufficient to coverstudent needs for current tuition costs; it seems unlikely student aidfunds would increase in proportion to tuition increases.If federal funds are removed and not replaced by the states, thenumbers of students admitted each year will be sharply reduced, thenation's total yearly output of nurse-midwives will be severly reduced,services created by educational programs will be reduced or closed, careto indigent populations will be less available and costs will surely rise.Nurse-midwives are valuable enough to the nation that a federalpriority to continue educating nurse-midwives and to increase theirutilization should be established.All of us in nurse-midwifery education are aware of the need fordependable funding sources. Directors and faculties of nurse-midwiferyeducation programs are devising strategies for shifting their funding basefrom soft money to hard money. All faculties would like to be fullysupported on herd money by their universities, as are the programs atSt. Louis University and University of Kentucky. Since most universitybudgets will not permit that kind of full support, nurse - midwifery educationalprogress are turning to developing self-supporting nurse-midwifery servicesas a means of finding financial support and clinical experiences forstudents.Nurse-midwifery education lends itself easily to this model becausenurse-midwifery is largely taught in the clinic and at the bedside. Facultymost practice in order to teach nurse-midwifery; these same faculty, withaccompanying students, could be reimbursed either through Medicaid orthrough private insurance plans. A faculty which had a practice largeenough to offer students the necessary clinical experiences would besupplying a substantial part of its own salary. The university would thenfund the non - clinical teaching activities, such as conducting seminars,curriculum revising, student counseling and program administration.Financing nurse-midwifery education through private faculty practiceIs a concept which many programs are exploring. There ia, however, atension between the need to shift the funding base and the politicalreality of opposition to nurse-midwifery practice. 362 11Among the six obstacles to greater federal utilization of certified nurse-midwives which the GAO report identifies, the limited supply, few training programs, reluctance of some nurse-midwives to practice in less desirable areas, restrictive state licensing or third party reimbursement, non-availability of obstetricians with whom to work, physician resistance is the most difficult problem.2\u00b0 This problem was recently the subject of an investigatory hearing held by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation of the Nouse of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee. The resistance occurs despite the demand for nurse-midwives by consumers, state governments and federal agencies, despite the record of improved health for mothers and babies, despite cost effectiveness and despite the widespread employment of nurse-midwives through the country. Resistance to nurse-midwifery practice is strong and seems to be gathering strength.While this resistence is described in some detail, it is important to keep in mind the co-existing reality that in many communities nurse - midwives, physicians and hospitals have formed mutually satisfying professional relationships.The ACNM and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) often work together on issues of importance to mothers and babies.Nurse-midwifery practice was officially Indorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Nurses Association of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in a statement issued jointly with the ACNM in 1971 and in a supplemental statement in 1975.The ACNM has benefited from and appreciated AGOG', official support.The incidence of resistance is widespread and has been found in recent months in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey. Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Maryland, Delaware, South Carolina. Tennessee, Illinois, and South Dakota. Resistance comes from many sources: individual physicians, professional organizations such as medical societies, hospital department of obstetrics, public bodies such as state boards of health and state medical practice boards, insurance companies, and occasionally nursing.The form which the resistance takes varies as well. It includes refusal to provide medical collaboration, refusal of permission or privileges for use of hospital facilities, placement of unjustifiable restrictions on nurse-midwifery practice or settings, refusal of third party payors to reimburse nurse-midwives, harassment of physicians who support nurse-midwifery practice, request for unreasonable payments for liability insurance and misrepresentation of the nature of nurse-midwifery przetice to the public.In Washington, D.C. Georgetown University Medical Center has consistently refused to allow nurse-midwives to practice in labor and delivery, even though the school of nursing has had a nurse-midwifery education program for several years. 363 12 In New Jersey the Board of Medical Examiners hasissued regulations which restrict nurse-midwiferypractice and which prohibit nurse-midwives fromcaring for women under 16 and over 35 years ofage.Thetis regulations have a severe impact onnurse-midwives and their clients, especiallyadolescents, in New Jersey.In Nashville, Tennessee the two nurse-midwifemembers of an obstetrician-nurse-midwife teamwere denied privileges at three hospitalsin which their physician practiced. Theirphysician experienced such strong ha ntfrom his colleagues, including cancellation ofhis insurance by the physician owned 'malpracticeinsurance company, that he has left Tennessee. Noother physician in Nashville is willing to collaboratewith nurse - midwives in private practice. The nurse-midwives have been forced to close their businessand undertake expensive legal action. They will befiling suit in a few wteks.21When Maternity Center Association in New York Cityopened its Childbearing Center, en out of hospitalbirth center, they did so despite the opposition of awide array of state agencies, state physicians' organ-izations and national physicians' organizations.22In Englewood, N.J., the Childbirth Center hasstruggled to survive in the face of opposition fromlocal physicians, the Board of Medical Examiners andmajor insurance company.23In Washington, D.C., a private group practice of threenurse-midwives who do home births embarked a yo.:r agoonpilot experiment doing hospital births at theWashington Hospital Center. In order to obtain privilegesthe nurse-midwives became technically the emplryees oftheir collaborating physicians who already hod privileges.Although the first year vent well, ths hospital's Depart-sent of Obstetrics and Gynecology voted to itnd the nurse-midwives' privileges because they are also doing homebirths.The decision has not been carried through by thehospital's board of directors because of tht large publicoutcry against the decision. The Department of Obstetricshas formed a committee to review the nurse-aidylvss' charts.There -24 364 13 While scores of rationales fOr these obstacles exist. end each incidentis flavored with its own particular legal, administrative and interper.onalcharacteristics, two theses emerge from the arguments against nurse-midwifery practice. The first of these is the issue of quality of care andof patient safety. The rare. and often preventable occurrence of acosplicatioe of pregnancy or birth is often cited as the reason for prevent-ing nurse - midwives from practicing or for limiting the scope of theirpractice to less than that for which they have been educated. Twoassumptions underlie that rationale. The first is the idea that while nurse-midwives are better than no prenatal or intrapartum care at all, thephysician is always more desirable because of his or her education in deal-ing with complications. The statistics refute that claim. The record ofnurse-midwifery care in the United States in reducing infant mortality andmorbidity shove that nurse-midwives are safe. Countries with lover infantmortality rates than the United States' rely heavily on professionalmidwives.The second underlying assumption is that the speed with whichcomplications arise is great enough to Justify physician presence through-out Libor and delivery managed by nurse-midwives. It is important toremember that pregnancy and childbirth are normal physiological practices.Normal. healthy pregnancy and delivery are the predominant realities ofchildbearing.Complications are the exceptions, not the rule. Nurse-midwives. unlike most physicians, are able to be in constant attentionthroughout labor. Thus. nurse-midwives detect problems at the earliestmoment and often avert them. Extremely serious complications which de.eloprapidly are extremely rare. Many common complications of labor and deliveryresult from the routine interventions of traditional medical care which donot characterise routine nurse-midwifery care. Nurse-midwives are educatedto recognize the syuptons of complications, to bezin the appropriate inter-ventions and to call for assistance immediately when complications arise.The second chum which emerges in the resistance of nurse-midwiferypractices Is that of \"independent practice.\" Licensure, direct third partyreimbursement, home birth services and out-of-hospital birth centers allraise the question of whether nurse- midwives are, or should be, \"Independentpractitioners.\" \"Independent practice\" appears to mean a nurse-midwifehanging up her shingle In a solo practice patterned after the independentbusiness of the solo physician in private practice. The implication cfthis model is that the nurse-midwife would be practicing without back-upphysician, without the system for consultation with physicians, referralof clients to physicians and without the collaborative management ofclient care by both a nurse-midwife and a physician which are an integralpart of the definition of nurse-midwifery practice. The record needs tobe very clear on this matter. Nurse-midwives do not practice midwiferyin the \"independent practice\" model of the private solo practice whichcharacterises much physician practice. The \"Functions. Standards andQualifications for Nurse-Midwifery Practice\" states that nurse-midwiferypractice \"Occurs interpendently within a health care delivery system.Occurs within a formal written alliance .Ith an obstetrician; or another 365 14physician, or a group of physicians. who has/have a formal consultativearrangement with an obstetrician-grecolosist; exists within a frameworkof medically approved protocols.\"The dictates of the \"Functions, Standards and Qualifications forNurse-Midwifery Practice\" are clearly explained by Helen Varney, thecurrent president of the American College of Nurse-Midwives in her recentlyreleased textbook of nurse-midwifery. \"'Independent sapagemeat' refersto the fact that a Imtlant may never see a physician if her courseessentially is normal and she is menages by a nurse-midvife. Thus, thepractice of nurse - midwifery within the protocols for practice, whichdefine the practice and provide for medical consultation and referralis independent. . . Independent practice means without medical protocolsof formalized physician hack-up. A certified nurse-midwife always functionswithin a health care system in team relationship with a physician and isnever independent of physician back-up f^r consultation, collaborativemanagement, or referral.\"26 Should a nurse-midwife be thought to be violatingthe principles established in 'Functions, Standards and Qualifications,\"she would be subject to investigation by the Amerimp College of Nurse-Midwives and would be vulnerable to censure, suspension, expulsion or decertification. Nurse-midwives have always practiced and will continue to practiceis collaboration with physicians; that relationship will not change.What has begun to change, however, is the employment relationship betweenthe nurse-midwife and her collaborating physician. Nurse-eldwive arenow not always employees of physicians or hospitals. In some cases thenurse-midwife has joined the practice of her physician p4.7tners. In (Aparcases, nurse-midwives are employing physicians to provide them with consul-tation and referral services. Nurse-midwives are increaaingly eligiblefor direct third-parry reimbursement. Many private insurance companiesincluding Connecticut General, Travelers, Aetna, and all union insuranceprograms, will reimburse nurse-eidwives in all states. New Mexico, Utahand Maryland have adjusted their insurance codes to include directreimbursement to nurse-aidwives. CRAMS and Medicaid now reimbursenurse - midwives. All of these changes seen there is substantially morecompetition in the obstetrical market place. All of these changes mean thata nursraddwife may become economically independent of her physician orhospital back-up services. Her professional interdependence with physiciansand hospitals remains and always will.Until nurse-midvives are able to establish self-supporting facultypractice arrangements which put education programs on dependable, renewablefinancial bases, nurse-midwifery education programs will need federal aid.Until this country no longer has citizens who lack access to maternaland child health care and to safe options in maternity care, the federalgovernment will need nurse-midwives. Nurse-midwifery services proVide the federal government with a safetynet upon which to depend in a time of budget cuts. Certified nurse-midwivesare in part an antidote to the high coat of federal maternal and infanthealth care.Funds invested in nurse-midwifery education are moneysprudently invested and many times returned. 3 7 2 366 The following are specific recommendations for your consideration duringdiscussion of the Nurse Training Act. I.Increase funding for the Nurse Training Act, includirg for Advanced NurseTraining programs; Nurse Practitioner programs and Special Projects.Rationale:The increasing economic stress of our time will create an_ -increasing need for nurse-midwives to serve disadvantaged populations.An increased number of nurse-midwives will be needed to meet the needsof these populations and to meet the CHENAC projections.2. Increase funding for National Health Service scholarships and jobs;change the eligibility regareftents to include certificate program aswell as masters degree program students.Rationa_le'The NHSC is a cost-effective means of providing care tomedically underserved areas. Nurse-midwives are appropriate member:of the Corps because of their ability as health educators as well asproviders, and their suitability for areas which cannot attract anobstetrician or for areas which can support an obstetrician and anurse-midwifebut not two obstetricians. 1.Increase funding for scholarships and student loans.Rationale: The $2,500 a year available through loans to eligible studentsand the $2,000 available through scholarships are not enough aid to helpmost disadvantaged students enough to enable them to enroll. 4. Encourage states to develop mechanisms for sharing the costs of nurse-xidwifery education among state, federal and private organizations.Rationale:Pooling of resources and sharing of costs can reducethe cost per student to each participating institution. Mechanismssuch as regional funding and regional allocation of clinical resourcescould lead to increases in the number of nurse-midwives graduatingeach year, without leading to substantial increases in education costs. 37'3 36?

The National AHEC Program is characterized in the followingmanner: 1.It is a program of education and training of physiciansand other health manpower based in the academic medical .377 371 Page 3 center.Twenty (20) medical schools participate in theprogram as prime contractors. Subsequent subcontractsserve to involve fully one-third of the nation'smedical schools in the National AHEC Program. 2.It is designed to bring the education and training ofhealth manpower to underserved communities via thedevelopment of new regional training centers (usuallycommunity hospitals or community health centers) thatassume responsibility for helping to meet the healthmanpower development needs of a defined number of ruralcounties or inner city neighborhoods. Today the 21 AHECprojects account for 76 regional centers called AHECs. 3.It has had a measurable and significant impact on thegeographic and specialty maldistribution of physiciansand other health manpower in underserved areas.In addition, the National AHEC Program demonstrates thefollowing important characteristics: 1.It is based on incentives and voluntarism. 2.It reflects an approach whereby federal funds areprovided to states and regions to develop manpowerprograms that meet local and regional needs in thecontext of national goals. 3.It demonstrates that most projects have been able touse federal AHEC funds to catalyze state, local andother funds which have assured that most of the AHECprojects funded in part by the federal government in .3 7 372 Page 4 1972 will survive--in whole or in part--following thecessation of federal funds.--as noted, since 1972 The Congress has appropriated$144.2 million for the National AHEC Program. In thatperiod of time over $291.5 million of state, local andother funds have also been catalyzed by this federalinvestment. 4.It demonstrates the fact that the federal governmentcan catalyze regional activities which meet uniquelocal circumstances through the flexible statutoryrequirements and minimal rules and regulations. Thisfederal approach has been critical to the success ofthe Program, especially for the projects originallyfunded in 1972.The projects support funding of the National AHEC Programfor FY 1982 at the level of authorization listed in HR 7203 aspassed by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980. This levelis $28 million. Further, the projects believe this authorizationshould be followed by authorizations of $30 million for FY 1983and $32 million for FY 1984.It is Important to recognize that the foregoing levels offunding include funds for the start-up of new AHEC projects.Should The Congress be interested only in assuring the develop-ment of those projects to which it already has a contractualobligation then an authorization level of only $23 million isneeded for fiscal year 1982, $25 million for fiscal year 1983,and $27 million for fiscal year 1984. 379 373 Page 5 Program Accomplishments As noted, the National AHEC Program has had a measurableand significant impact on the distribution of physicians andhealth manpower. This is particularly true of the elevenprojects originally funded in 1972. The remaining projectsfunded subsequent to 1977 are too young to have had an impactc.n manpower distribution. For this reason, the accomplishmentsof the National AHEC Program will be listed in two categoriesaccording to date of initial federal funding of the projects. I.AHEC Projects Originally Funded in 1972Pages6 - 12. II.AHEC Projects Funded Subsequent 1972Pages13 - 19. 3 374 Page 6 Projects Funded in 1972 CALIFORNIACalifornia began a Statewide AHEC Program under newauthorizing legislation in 1979, but one of the original elevenprojects also took place in California starting in 1972. The principal target area was the Central San Joaquin Valley. The Health Science Centers were the University of California atSan Francisco (UCSF) and the University of California atLos Angeles (UCLA). The major objectives of the Central Valleyprogram have been accomplished, and as federal funding draws toa close dramatic results can be counted. For example:--Before the project began there were virtually no medicalstudent rotations to the AHEC area. Now there are 180 studentrotations per year, many of which are core clerkships in theUCSF Medical School curriculum. Faculty appointments for practicing physicians in the target area have increased.--Physician resident training in primary care specialties hasrisen during this period from 12 to 129.- -A series of consortia of small hospitals was organized toconduct continuing education for physicians and other healthprofessionals throughout this area which is nearly as largeas the state of South Carolina; this service continues withoutfederal funding, paid for by fees and subscriptions.- -The impact of these physician education programs is shown bya survey of physiciail population done in the sixth yeartokkLskeav4A ekv. i.screateeab.ok- 14 PO'CAL,.:r OVIA,Ire...4RMA4Cnk.- -Other major achievements included development of a new dentalresidency program fed by a steady stream of dental students;an extensive network of nurse career ladder programs fromnurse aide to associate degree programs, Bachelor of ArtsDegree programs, and Master's-level programs, as well as twonurse practitioner programs; a wide range of allied healthtraining activities; and a strong, enduring communityorganization.Much of this program has been transferred to other fundingand other elements have been closed as the need was met. No federal support is expected after this year.The California Area Health Education Center System, begunin 1979 under authorization of Section 781 of PL 94-484, buildsupon the demonstrated success of the local project begun in 1972. 3 s 375 Page 7 It compares areas which had significant AHEC educational activity with similar areas which did not have AHEC assistance. Positive changes in the AHEC-Impacted areas were substantial, compared to a decline of physicians in the non-AHEC areas. The AHEC areas showed a net gain of 152 physicians, an increase of more than twenty percent.ILLINOIS401 clinical training of all medical students now in community hospitals.- -112 family practice residents serving 42 counties.--Retention of family practice residents - 70%.--Over past nine years, $70 million in State funds went into regionalization.MINNESOTA- -AHEC has provided training for approximately 1,900 students in ten different health fields. AHEC has:- -Provided ..ural preceptorships for 470 medical students andrural clinical rotations for 170 residents.--Provided over 500 registered nurses with off-campus courses and nurse practitioner training, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels.- -Provided rural preceptorships for nearly 150 dental students.--Assisted the Medical School to develop se-ren different clinical preceptorships to improve the supply of physiciansin underserved areas.- -Assisted in the creation of the position of Assistant VicePresident for Health Sciences Outreach.MISSOURI- -Has encompassed all disciplines of allied health (includingdieticians and radiology technicians) into an organized network of C.E. programming, particularly in west central and northwest areas.pr,witIL!a and distributed an audio-visual catalogue ofove: 800 program,: available at no charge, for use by area health cart_ professionals and nospital libraries as well as stttdents In the field. .3QA,/ 376 Page 8 - -Established an In-WATS line for learning resource requests ofboth reproduction and on-line search. In addition, most A/Vprograms are requested this way from area professionals andinstitutions.All facilities at our health science libraryare available to participants.--Has conducted a very successful minority recruitment effortcalled Summer Scholars 1980 for area high school Juniors andseniors.Another program is planned for 1981 in Kansas City,and also for the St. Joseph area. Other talent identificationprogram efforts have been extremely successful in identifyingstudents at this level.--Participation in three study tours to acquaint health sciencestudents with career possibilities in the state of Missouri,(medical, pharmacy, dental and nursing) as well as a veryactive externship /preceptorship program in the areas ofmedicine, pharmacy, dentistry, and nursing. Over two-thirdsof the medicine rotations are in primary care/family practicesettings.- -A strong nurse practitioner program in southwest Missouri,providing externship experiences and C.E.- -Established a viable working liaison with the health scienceschools of UMKC and UMC, particularly in nursing and alliedhealth.NEW MEXICO- -Developed an organization of Indian health program adminis-trators and planners.- -Developed and sustained health professional training programsfor nurses, emergency medical technicians, physician assistants,medical technologists and community health representatives onthe NavaJo.- -Supported over 300 Indian students in various health trainingprograms.Of those who have completed their training, over85% are working with Indian people.NORTH CAROLINA--Medical student education is now occurring on a regular basisin over half of North Carolina's 100 counties. The proportionof North Carolina medical school graduates who are choosingto practice in North Carolina has increased dramaticallysince the start of the AHEC Program. In the 1960's only 30%of the State's medical school graduates were eventuallylocating in North Carolina. That number has risen to over40% of graduates since 1972 and the student body has doubledin size. 3S:3 377 Page 9 --Primary care residency training now takes place in all nine AHEC regions of North Carolina. Historically, the State has retained slightly over one-third of the residents trained here.In 1980, two-thirds of AHEC-trained primary care residentsremained in North Carolina to practice.--From 1973 to 1978, the improvement in North Carolina'spopulation /physician ratio was 20% compared to 15% for therest of the U.S. North Carolina's rural counties haveImproved their physician/population ratios significantlygreater than other rural U.S. counties.- -A process is in place to direct major program initiativestoward improving the recruitment and retention of nurses inthe State's hospitals and other health agencies. As an initial step, a major statewide nurse manpower survey wasconducted by AHEC which documented 1,500 budgeted vacanciesfor RNs in North Carolina in 1980, and showed the annualturnover rate of RNs to be 23% in the State's health careagencies.NORTH DAKOTA--By means of the AHEC contract, North Dakota developed itsdegree-granting medical school, a statewide program in whichcommunity physicians are the faculty and community hospitalsare the campus. Since the inception of AHEC, North Dakota'smedical school has graduated five classes, a total of 200new physicians.--Also due to the AHEC contract, North Dakota now offers sixprimary care residency programs throughput the State - fourprograms in family medicine and one program each in internalmedicine and obstetrics-gynecology. These six programs train 62 residents per year.- -In 1972, the year of the AHEC contract award, North Dakota'sratio of physicians to 100,000 population was 85.1. In 1977,five years into the AHEC Program, North Dakota had climbed toa ratio of 108.0. Although this ratio does not yet approachthe national average, it represents a significant advance inphysician manpower for North Dakota.SOUTH CAROLINA- - Increased extramural residency positions from 69 in 1972 to337 in 1980; three-fourths of these are primary care.- -Senior medical student rotations to rural areas have increasedfrom 27 weeks in 1972 to 995.5 weeks per year in 1980-81.

It has organized all -.tight fully- developed medical schools intc cooperative relationship with the ma)or state health agencies and with a developing network of local AHECs. Twelve local centers are now in planning or development phases and four more are expected to be added in fiscal year 1983. Of these, nine will have an urban focus, while six will serve the needs of rural areas.Much of the successful experience in the Central Valley will be useful in the new endeavor, but new approaches to the university-community partnership also are being developed in urban areas where the barriers to health care are significantly different from those in rural areas. Although some parts of the state are \"over- doctored\", the Division of Health Professions Analysis, DHHS estimates that 2.7 million people reside in primary care health shortage areas in California and that 871 additional primary care physicians are needed in these areas.This is a classical case of maldistribution which has resisted solution for decades. The AHEC program has proven to be an effective remedy to this problem.The California AHEC pro)ect is a potent alliance of the educational resources and local and state agencies needed to overcome the problem of maldistribution of health professionals. These efforts are carefully targeted to areas and populations of need and are supported by the California Medical Association and other important professional groups. In fact, there are fourteen active professional, student and community committees which are designing and evaluating educational components. In selected areas of severe manpower shortage, we will increase training opportunities (over 100 new primary care physician residency positions are planned to be added), but in other cases we will zely on other mechanisms to induce distribution, including recruiting and retention programs, and enhancement of the professional environment.COLORADO- -Medical student core clerkships exist now in four AHECcommunities where none previously existed. In 1980-81 100 students will study medicine, pediatrics, surgery, obstetrics-gynecology, and/or psychiatry in community hospitals away from Denver.- -Precertorshis for medical students have been greatly expanded since 1977 when only 5-10 students per year participated. In 1980-31, over 40 students will work with rural Colorado physicians through the AHEC Program. 3 S \" 382 Page 14 --Nursing baccalaureate students are using rural Coloradohospitals and health departments for part of their clinicaleducation.For the first time these rural facilities have anopportunity to recruit baccalaureate nurses for their communityand graduates are returning to the sites of their ruralexperiences to work.--The AHECs offer continuing education to practicing healthprofessionals in rural areas. During 1980-81 an estimated4,000 rural professionals will receive continuing educationclose to home.CONNECTICUT--AHEC has provided key support in establishing a requiredprimary care clerkship which will involve 70 fourth yearmedical students each year in urban health experiences inunderserved inner cities.--Supported the expansion of a family medicine residency programto include a significant focus on urban and community healthissues and needs.--Developed contracts with seven health professions schoolsincluding:medicine, dentistry, allied health, public health,nutrition sciences, nursing, and social work to place studentsin discipline-specific and inter-disciplinary experiences inAHEC-developed and sponsored sites.--Supported the development and implementation of a school nursepractitioner program to upgrade the clinical skills of schoolnurses.This has increased their ability to function in amulti-disciplinary environment and has expanded their under-standing and utilization of community health resources.--Developed a university-wide approach to minority recruitmentand development, including linkages to public schools, othereducational and training programs in the target area andbranch compuses of the university.--Has utilized the resources of key agencies withln the Blackand Hispanic communities to plan, develop and implementeducational programs for students, health practitioners andcommunity residents.KANSAS--While only in the middle of its second year of existence, theWestern Kansas Rural AHEC Program has already planned,developed, and/or conducted over 30 community-based programsin continuing education for nurses and allied healthprofessionals. The programs conducted to date have attractedover 500 individuals in nearly 15 different communities. 3 8J 383 Page 15 - -In addition, community-based continuing education programs for rural physicians have been initiated through the AHEC Program and have been conducted by medical school faculty in cooperation with medical specialists in Northwest Kansas.Over 150 rural physicians in six different communities have attended programs ranging in content from: medical ethics to toxic shock syndrome.Dozens more programs have been requested throughoutthe regions for the upcoming year.MARYLAND- -Consists of three active AHECs (two urban and one rural) with plans being implemented for an additional rural center.- -One of the urban centers is unique in the Nation because it is designed to address problems of ready access to and maldistribution of health care providers for a specific geriatric population.- -The numbers of students, both graduate and undergraduate, andresidents that have rotated through the three centers for the past 1 1/2 years are as follows: Medicine:Undergraduates - 67, Allied Health: 27, for a total of 265.- -To date, three physicians, four dentists, four social workers,four nurses, six nurse practitioners, and three pharmacists have located in a designated underserved area in the State following their experience in the Cumberland AHEC Program.MASSACHUSETTS- -The Massachusetts Statewide Area Health Education CenterProgram is a partnership effort among three medical schools (University of Massachusetts Medical School/Worcester, Boston University School of Medicine, and Tufts University School of Medicine), ten other health professions schools and programs of these universities, and community-based institutions which have planned or will plan local Area Health Education Centers (AHECs).The Program is federally supported and was initiated in October, 1978.- -Established four regional AHECs, and is planning two additionalcenters.--Assisted in the establishment of a primary care preceptorship program at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center,required of all students. 3 j 0 --Assisted in the implementation of residency training in innercity Boston health centers and public schools, and in ruralsites in Western Massachusetts effecting a total of 33 primarycare residents.- -Increased nursing graduates in Western Massachusetts by 12graduates per year, developed new training affiliations inhospital and home health care settings for nursing students,fostered career ladder opportunities for ADN nurses byfacilitating transfer to BSN programs, and funded thedevelopment of a family care nurse practitioner program.--Assisted in the establishment of a preceptorship program fordental students in Boston neighborhood health centers.NEW JERSEY- -The New Jersey AHEC has put its first Area Health EducationCenter (the Greater Camden AHEC) into operation on October 1,1980, and is scheduled to put its second AHEC into operation(the Central Camden AHEC) on October 1, 1981.

Regional programs at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, and Case Western Reserve University are in the third year of the program and are operating centers in Georgetown, Youngstown, Akron, and Cleveland.The Wright State University School of Medicine will begin its third year on April 1, 1981 with an operation of a Center in Dayton. The Medical College of Ohio, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, and Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine are now conducting developmental activities and have established Centers in Sandusky, Lima, Columbus, and Athens.--In addition to the medical schools, 24 schools or programs of the other health professions are participating actively in the Statewide Program. These include dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, and allied health. Students from these disciplines as well as medicine are being trained throughout Ohio.PENNSYLVANIA- -Medical interviewing was completed by 52 students and 86students completed the Introduction to Patient Care Course.- -Seven students elected clerkships at St. Margaret's andShadyside Family Practice Residencies as part of the Primary Care Senior Elective.- -Coordination and liaison with family practice residencies by six specialty coordinators (i.e., community medicine,psychiatry St. (2) a dermatology clinic for Shadyside residents (3)first use of patient simulators at St. Margaret's(4) psychiatric teaching, precepting and curriculum development at Washington, Shadyside and St. Margaret's residency program and (5) a one-day otolaryngology workshop for residents of six Family Practice Residency Programs. 394 386 Page 18 - -20 fourth year dental students participated in a rural clinicalpractice at Westmoreland Hospital Association and the CurryMemorial Home one day per week for 16 weeks (2 sessions).- -Fifteen third year dental students participated in an urbanexternship at Mathilda Theiss Health Center one day a weekfor 10 weeks.- -Four students who have agreed to seek employment in underservedareas have been enrolled in the Class of 1980 to be trainedas family nurse practitioners.

The cost-effect-iveness of disease prevention is believed to exceed that of curative treatmentof disease.It is further believed that the productivity and quality ofhuman life can be enhanced through health promotion activities such asphysical fitness. stress management, nutritional awareness, environmentalsensitivity. and increased self-respoasibility.To the extent that health promotion activities require the direction bytrained health professionals, the implenentstion of the state policy isconstrained by the availability of such professionals. The Federal Governmenthas a variety of programs affecting the mix of skills obtained by health pro-fessionals throughout the educational system. The State of California urgesthe Congress to direct more of our nation's health training resources towardthe development of oreventive health and health promotion skills.The persons receiving training in preventive health (including environmentaland occupational health) and health promotion should not be limited to physicians.Emerging mid-level health practitioners provide a means of expanding services ina more cost-effective manner than can be achieved through a reliance onohysicians alone. An increased number of mid-level practitioners have thepotential to improve the availability of primary care services in a less costlyfashion.The useofmid-level practitioners can also facilitate a shift froman illness-oriented health system to a system oriented tadard health and well-being. Tne following points relate to specific issues of manpower legislation: 1.General Duties of the Secretary of Health and human Services:The Secretary should be required to support activities designed toempower individuals to maintain and improve personal health status throughaccessibility to nutrition information, physicial fitness resources,stress management techniques, and other health promotion resources. 2.Capitation:Capitation grants should be weighted toward those health professionalsthat provide primary care, preventive health services, and health pro-motion services. 3.Incentive grants: Incentive grants should be designed to increase the numbers of primarycare providers as a percentage of the total number of health profes-sionals; incentives for the education of physician extenders (physician 395 389 -?- assistants, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives) should becreated. 4.Start-up grants: Grants for the initiation of programs to train non-physicianprimary care providers such as physician assistants, nursepractitioners, and nurse midwives; apprenticeship programs and on-the -job training for nurses should be supported: programs at nurseryschools that train non-physician primary care providers should besupported. 5.HEAL Loans and Health Professions Student Loans:Student loans should be weighted toward those programs that trainprimary care providers and health promotion specialists. Loans shouldbe extended to programs training chiropractors and other alternativehealth providers deemed capable of improving primary health careservices. 6.Loan repayment: The Secretary should be authorized to repay student loans for healthprofessionals providing primary care to underserved areas. 7.mISC Scholarships: The NHSC scholarships should be expanded to include the training ofnon-physician primary care providers including physicians assistants,nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, and nutrition counselors. 8.family Medicine Departments:Grants to medical and osteopathy schools to train family medicinepractitioners should be required to train non-physician providers and totrain physicians to oractice family medicine in cooperation with tnenon-physician providers in a primary care team approach. 9.Public Health and Health Administration: Special emphasis should be given to the development and expansion ofprograms in disease prevention and health promotion, including women'shealth, geriatrics, environmental health, occupational health, andnutrition. To the extent that funds are limited, public health programs shouldtrain non physician personnel that will increase the a%ailability ofpreventive health and health prevention activities at a lower cost perindividual practitioner. 3,9G 390 .3. 10.Allied Health Professions: Funds should be allocated to the training of more mid-level health practitioners capable of providing preventive health and health promotion services at a lower cost than physicians. 11.Special Projects: Section 188(d) of PHS At should require the Secretary to continue the availability of the 5th Pathway Program to United States citizens par. ticipating in the Betas Para Azatlan Program sponsored by the Mexican Government.Under the Betas Para Azatlan Program. Chicano students from the United States are provided scholarships to attend undergraduate and graduate school in Mexico. Upon graduation from medical school in Mexico. the students require additional training in the U.S. before becoming fully qualified to practice medicine. At present. the 5th Pathway Program is available for that purpose. but it may not continue to be ..eilable due to the increased supply of physicians graduating from United States' medical schools. While discontinuation of the 5th Pathway Program may (or may not) be appropriate. a specialized version of the program should be continued to meet the needs of Chicano students participating in the vecas Para Azatlan Program. Those students agree to serve Chicano areas in the United States as a condition of their receiving scholarships from the Mexican Government.Since the Chicano communities are generally medically underserved. the Betas Para Azatlan Program represents a means of raising the health status of Chicano Populations in the United States. 397 391 Association of Schools of Public of all the Deans of the U.S.Schools of Public Health, I respectfullysubmit our comments on S. 799, tha 'HealthProfessions Educational Assistance and NurseTraining Act of 1981'.

The Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH).,which represents all of the twenty-one U.S. Schools ofPublic Health, appreciates this opportunity to present its views on S. 799, the 'Health Professions EducationalAssistance and Nurse Training Act of 1981'. The purpose of this statement Is two-fold: one is tomake the Congress and this Committee aware of themajor training and financial problems facing Schoolsof Public Health today; and two is to clearly spellout the ASPH position on the Federal role in publichealth professions educational assistance programs. Public health deals with the protection and improvement of community health by organized community effort. Public health activities are essentially a public or government responsibility. The services of public health agencies are not reimbursable on a fee-for-service basis as are personal health services.Rather than treating the symptoms of disease in cne person, public health is concerned with discovering how a disease occurs, in halting its spread and in organizing programs for those who have been or may be affected by it in a community. state or nation. The goal in theory and in practice is to discover the source of ill health and to reduce or eliminate it at the earliest point. As a public responsibility such preventive activities have been largely supported by public funds. 'ASPH is the only national organization representing the Deans, faculty and students of the twenty-one Schools of Public Health. The Schools represent the primary education system that trains personnel needed to operate our Nation's public health, disease prevention am health promotion programs.ASPH's principal purpose is to promote and improve the education and training of professional public health personnel. 399 393 -2- Public health measures have been successful in controlling communicable diseasesas a major cause of death In the United States. While these measures shouldcontinue to prevent a resurgence. today the mojor public health problems in thiscountry involve the causes and control of chronic diseases such as cancer and heartdisease; the control or elimination of environmental health hazards; and theprovision of equal access to quality health care at reasonable costs.In recent years Congress has addressed these problems through significant legislationdealing with environmental health, disease prevention and planning, evaluation andmanagement of the health care delivery system. Such legislation has created growingmanpower needs in public health. The demand is expected to continue and increaseas new programs to improve the quality of life and reduce health cart costs are en-acted, yet Federal support has actually declined since the id-1960's.(See Table Iand Attachment A and 0). ---Few studies have been conducted on the impact of the new legislative initiatives onthe demand for public health manpower. A study conducted in 1973. prior to theenactment of the health planning law and the current emphasis on cost containment,showed a short fall in every category of professional public health manpower:U.S. ESTIMATED SUPPLY OF AND REQUIREMENTS FOR SELECTED CATEGORIESOF PROFESSIONAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH MANPOWER Professionals with masters level training or higherBase YearSupply(1970 unless1980 Supply, assuming Possible 1980'sConstantReducedSchoolSchoolOccupational Category 2.0003,6003,1006,000Health Services Administration 18,20015.30)25,200Health 1,1001,7001.5002.500Maternal Health, FamilyPlanning i Child Health 8001,8001.5002,000Mental Health 2004003501,100Public Health Dentistry 300550500550Public Health Nursing 2.4575.2004,5005.700Public Health Nutrition 1.0001,8001,5002.600Public Health VeterinaryMedicine 200350300550 Department of Health Administration, School of Public Health. University of NorthCarolina.Professional Health Manpower for Coemmnity Health Programs. Chapel Hill,North Carolina, 1973. The Schools of Public Health are the_bljor manpower training resources availableto meet the increasing demand- for highly trained and competent personnel in thepublic health field. 394 Federal health professional manpower policy has focused al,ost exclusively onOystclans and has based policy decisions affecting other health professions onconclusions relating to physicians. For example, studies hase shown that theremay be a substantial oversupply of physicians around 1990. Based on thisfinding the President's FY 1982 budget request assures an oversupply of allhealth professionals and consequently targets its request for health profTFsionseducation programs at minimizing the future oversupply of health professionals.As suggested by the chart, the available evidence indicates an unlersupply ofpublic heatlh personnel. Also the recent Surgeon General's report.(HealthyPeople) found that there is a need for prevention manpower especially in the Yields of epidemiology. biostatistics, health administration, environmentalhealth, occupational safety and health, nutrition, among others. Further, a December 1979 HHS report to Congress on community and public health personnelalso called for increased Federal support to programs training pro ssionals inthese priority public health areas. The Schools of Public Health' have been educating professionals in the techniquesof public health practice, health preservation, health promotion and diseaseprevention and control since the first decades of the twentieth century. Some Schools of Public Health had their begirnings in university schools of medicine;others were conceived from the outset as autonomous units within their parentinstitutions.Today there are twenty-one fully accredited Schools of PublicHealth in the United States, 7 at private and 14 at public universities.Schools of Public Health are distinct from other health professions schools in a number of ways. They are oriented to the community and prevention rather thanto the individual and cure. They train people in a value system that is equali-tarian and public service oriented. They train persons to be need oriented rather than demand oriented. They teach techniques of need response and how to view the 'community as a patient'. Students are prepared for community teamwork and adminis- tration rather than private practice. To solve coTunity health problems thetypical graduate works on a team in organized community action, deals withadministrative problems and must understand group behavior as well as health care techniques. locatel in 17 states and Puerto Rico, the 21 accredited Schools of Public Healthtrain students from every state in the nation. The Schools have a combinedenrollment of over 7,000 students and a faculty in excess of 1,700. Graduate education in the 21 Schools is organized around a number of major specialties. 'University of Alabama in Birmingham. University of California-Berkeley. University of California -Los Angeles, Columbia University, Harvard University. University of Hawaii. University of Illinois. The Johns Hopkins University, University of Loma Linda, University of Massachusetts. University of Michigan. University of Minnesota. University of Morth Carolina.

Boston University and San Diego State University will be seeking accreditation in the Fall of 1981 and 1982, respectively.\"When Federal support for Schools of Public Health began in the late 1950s, 11 Schools were training 2,000 students. Federal support has remained constant since the early 1970s. In constant dollars, Federal support has declined drastically (See Table Iand Attachment A and 0). 401 395 Same of the fields of concentration offered by the Schools are:Behavioral and Social SciencesBiostatisticsrfrivironmental Health Sciences'EpidemiologyHealth Services Administration.Policy 6 StudiesPublic Health Practice 6 ProgramManagement (e.g., public health nursing)Graduates of the Schools of Public Health work primarily in the public sector in the areas of health promotion and disease prevention. They represent the basicresource pool from which Federal, state and local health and environmentalagencies draw their manpower needs. Graduates also work and teach in universitysettings.' Industry relies heavily on the Schools to train their employeesinvolved in industrial hygiene, occupational safety and health, environmental toxicology, among others. The breakdown is as follows: 50 percent of graduates in a single given year go into Federal, state or local government service, 34 percent work for either non-profit community health agencies or universities and4percent work for industry. MPH data shows that the Schools no longer primarily train professionals for state and local government agencies. In response to a demand for new types of healthworkers and a broader concept of public health, the Schools have made major efforts to train students in health services administration and epidemiology, now the two most frequently chosen areas of specialization. Health services administrationattracted 1.923 students in 1979-80, or 26.1 percent of the total. With health planning and policy studies counted in. that total would be even higher.Epi- demiology narrowly displaced environmental health/sciences as the second most frequently chosen specialty. Environmental health/sciences ranked third with900 students in 1979-80 (12.2 percent). while 'other'areas of specialization was fourthwith827 students (11.2 percent) and public health practice and program management ranked fifth with 651 students.(8.8 percent). Students who attend the Schools are often mid-career professionals with a prior commitment to public service. Thege age is slightly over 30. A large percentage are part-time students already working in the public sector while upgrading their skills. It should be noted that a public health degree does notincrease the income potential of the graduate as much as other health professions degrees.Schools of Public Health are in the business of training men and women for public service. The 21accreditedSchools are two- thirds state owned and one-thirdprivately 83-520 0 -81 -2640'1 396 - 5 - owned.None of the private institutions, except the University of Pittsburgh,received state support. Private schools by and large depend on the traditionalmeans of private sector support such as endowments, tuition, gifts, etc., yetthey are in the business of training workers for the public sector.FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH I.Institutional Support Federal assistance to encourage development of experienced public health professionalsbegan with traneeship support in 1956, thus making Federal aid to Schools of PublicHealth one of the oldest health manpower training programs. Federal institutionalsupport was authorized in 1958 and the special project grants program began in 1960.Since the Federal assistance program began, the number of accredited Schools hasalmost doubled from 11 to 21 and the enrollment has increased fivefold, yetFederal support has remained constant since 1975. In current dollars, institutionalsupport has declined more than 40 percent since 1970.(See Table II and attached charts).The basic intention of Federal institutional support to public health schools isto increase the supply of health manpower in fields where the demand is high and/orwhere a shortage exists. The July 1979 Surgeon General's Report said that althoughthere is a lack of public health manpower data.* there are definite shortages ofcertain specialized disciplines such as epidemiologists, biostatisticians, occupa-tional and environmental health workers and health service administrators. The over-whelming majority of these professionals are trained in Schools of Public Health.Institutional support to both public and private non-profit Schools has provided ageneral subsidy which may be used for any educational program of the Schoolsincluding teaching and community service. Such grants supplement other sources ofincome and permit a degree of flexibility in program development. For the newerand smaller Schools the institutional subsidy has stimulated growth and provides a measure of financial stability. Providing basic institutional support is a means whereby the Federal governmentcan share the costs** with states and private institutions for the training ofpublic health personnel to manage and operate governmental health programs The Schools still need flexible but accountable funds which they can use tosupport parts of their overall program which have been weakened by insufficientFederal, state and local and private financing. Adequate training and research funds are available in certain fields such astoxicology, nutrition, occupational safety and health to partially support studentsand to purchase supplies and equipment. However, there are no categorical fundsavailable, except the old formula grants and the present capitation grants, thatprovide adequate support for curriculum development and program support.ASPH believes that S. 799 should provide the basic generic support for improvingthe quality of the curriculum and teach techniques and enhance the capacity ofthe Schools to provide health promotion and disease prevention activities in thecommunity. Reasons for the lack of data are several, such as lack of uniform and fixeddefinitions and requirements for employment, methodological problems and high costsof gathering information.**Teaching costs per student per year approximate those of medical schools. ASPHestimates that it costs $15,000 to train one public health student each year. 403 397 -6- An alternative to capitation is needed because of the general disfavor of the program.While it has been effective in increasing enrollment, it has not been effective as a means of addressing the problems of specialty and geographic mal-distribution.Dealing with these problems requires targeted programs of assistance. Basic institutional support would assure the health care system an adequate supplyof public health professionals in defined national priority areas. HR 2004 targets financial support to categorical programs that are responsive to national health requirements and programs. The quid al sug implied in Federal support is basedon results in terms of increased minority enrollments, public service commitmentof students and graduates attracted to specialty and geographic areas in need.Federal support, in terms of instituitonal, student, and curriculum assistance,challenges Schools to place cpphasis on Federally defined priority areas. It ensures the training of professionals (such as health administrators, biostatisti-cians, epidemiologists, public health nurses, preventive medicine specialists,environmental and occupational health specialists, nutritionists, maternal and child health workers, among others) who would provide services in disease control,protection against health hazards, health services management, reduction of cost,health promotion as well as disease prevention.The Administration has proposed the termination of capitation funds for all healthprofessions schools in FY 1982 based on the assumption that capitation grants art incentive payments to Schools to increase their enrollment and are no longerneeded since there is or will be an adequate supply of licensed health professionalsin the 1980s and 1990s. Yet ASPH studies and two prepared by HHS point out thatthe demand for the types of health manpower trained by Schools of Public Healthwill increase as a result of current and future legislative and Administrationinitiatives in the fields of disease prevention and health promotion (not tomention improved management of health services delivery). These initiatives are looked uoon as means to improve the quality of life and to reduce skyrocketing health care costs.In view of the growing demand for health manpower stimulated by recent passage ofFederal programs such as health planning, clean air, clean water, toxic substances,health maintenance organizations, older Americans act, nutrition programs, PSROs, and other federal initiatives such as home health care,child immunizations, mentalhealth, child health, health promotion, rural and urban health initiatives. among others, the ASPH believes that continued institutional su ort isustif.rd bthe nature of public health as a goverrmenta enterer se a med at the improvement o the TaTtc's health. !orthermore, the Schools of Public Health presently represent the major source of supply of trained personnel to implement and manage the Federal health programs and initiatives. institutional support is simply a partial reim-bursement of costs incurred by the Schools in providing comprehensive training ofpersonnel for Federal, state and local governments, industry and voluntary health agencies charged with the responsibility of carrying out Federalprograms and meeting Federal health requirements. A December 1979 report to Congress on Community and Public Health Personnel andthe Surgeon General's Report, Healthy People. Also the Institute of Medicine and MNhave repeatedly stated that a Th-67T-TuFFT7-6f eoidemiologists and biostatisticians exists. 4tf 398 - 7 - The Federal fuhds received by Schools of Public Health have been considered to be the Federal government's share of preparing public health personnel to meet the needs of the public today and for the future. The amounts, while small in comparisonto overall expenditures, have and will continue to contribute to the preparationof this vital health resource. The percentage of Federal funds as authorized under P 1. 94-484 to each School is approximately 10 percent of their total budgets. The capacity of the Schools to respond to emerging needs, to offer a balanced curriculum and to provide graduate training in critical areas which are unsupportedby other funding sources would be severely reduced by the absence of institutional support.To delete institutional support now or in the near future will diminish the ability of the Schools to serve the Nation's health in the manner intended bythose national leaders who first conceived the notion of financial support to Schools of Public Health. ASPH urges the Committee to amend S. 799 to provide stable support t) the Schools of Public Health. This financial assistance would enable these ,,ublit health graduate institutions to provide categorical educational programs and community services that are complementary to national public health shortage areas outlined in Healthy. People. The quid pro ER implied in Federal assistance would be based on results: -Increased supply of professionals working in nationallydefined specialty shortage areas such as health administrationand management, biostatistics, epidemiology, nutrition,gerontology, environmental and occupational health (includingtoxicology). health promotion, maintenance and diseaseprevention, among others. -Increased supply of manpower needed to implement nationalpublic health and health care service programs.The justification for continuing institutional support to students and Schools of Public Health is generally the same as it was 20 years ago when the program first began.Public health schools train personnel for public service. The Federal government has a direct interest in assuring that an adequate supply of public health personnel is trained in quality institutions to manage and operate the health delivery system in the national interest. II.Student Assistance (Traineeships) ASPH strongly urges enactment of a traineeship section in S. 799 to provide needed support to students entering or continuing their professional careers in public health. The traineeship program is intended to attract high caliber students and to offer the economically disadvantaged, especially minorities, an entry point into the system. The rising cost of tuition and other expenses will make it even more difficult for low-income students, particular minorities, 405 899 - 8 - to afford graduate education in public health schools. Furthermore, manly undertake graduate study in public health at mid-career and have important family obligations. Others have already accrued heavy debts from their previous education. Over 75 percent of students received sane fore of financial help in 1979-80.The graduates, unlike manly of the other health professions, do not enjoy lucrative incomes.Over 90 percent of the graduates are employed by governmental and community agencies and universities. Their modest salary levels are reflected in a recent survey which showed an average of only $30,000 after 15 years of exper- ience.Of the 1979 graduates, 57 percent earn less than $19,000 per year, 17 percent $19,000 to $22,000, and 20 percent $25,000.Calculated in constant dollars, traineeship support has declined by 48.6 percent since 1970 with enrollments growing in that same period (52 percent). This has meant less money to be spread among more students. (See Table III).It should be noted that the limitation on the amount of an individual traineeship award puts the Schools of Public Health at a competitive disadvantage in recruiting physician students in residency programs.Traineeship support to students in Schools of Public Health is justified on the grounds that a majority of our students enter (or re-enter) public service. A recent ASPH survey of 1979 graduates shows that 50 percent worked in tax supported agencies of the Federal, state, regional and local governments and 26 percent worked for voluntary and non-profit, private health organizations. Over 32 percent of the 1979 graduates are providing public service administrative, planning or evaluation services, 15 percent education or other training services in public health, 5 percent public health community organization services and 38 percent are providing technical services such as clinical, laboratory, social and environmental services.ASPH urges the Committee to amend S. 799 to include support for traineeships. Again, Schools of Public Health train men and women primarily for service in the public sector in the areas of health promotion, disease prevention and in the organ- ization and administrat'on of health services.Traineeships support these indivi- duals in their public service career paths. *Survey and analysis by Thomas Hall, M.D., of the School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina. (Sae Attachment 8).**In 1979-80, 53.6 percent of public health students were women. 406 400 9 III. Special Projects ASPH supports the special project grant section of S. 799 (Section 790). Thisprovision, however, does not replace losses to the Schools brought on by inflation.As inflation has gone up, Federal assistance in special project grants has gone down.In FY 1973. the Congress appropriated $6 million for special projects;in FY 1981 it approved $5 million which represents $3.0 million in 1972 dollars. Yet School enrollment increased 40 percent since 1973. (See Table IV).These grants are used for projects that are designed to place emphasis on curriculum in the areas of national public health manpower needs (epidemiology, biostatistics,health administration, nutrition, gerontology, environmental and occupationhealth, maternal and child health, among others). These grants are used tocomplement Federal Initiatives that are stimulating a growing demand for publichealth personnel. The special project grants program began in 1960 and was intended to aid accreditedSchools of Public Health to develop new programs and expand existing programs inbiostatistics and epidemiology, health administration, health planning, health policy analysis and planning, environmental and occupational health and dietetics and nutrition. An amendment by the 95th Congress opened this authority to any educational entity offering programs in the above areas without increasing the authorization level. Project grants provide support for the development of training opportunities in public health to meet emerging national priorities for public health manpower competencies.These include the training of leadership for management and specializedresponsibilities in new and projected health agencies and agencies to controlenvironmental health hazards, plus private industry. Project grant appropriations have been decreasing since 1973. Inflationary pressures have accelerated that decline. Calculated in constant dollars in the FY 1980 appropriation of $5 million is 40 percent less than the amount appropriated in FY 1973. (See Table IV). Further, Schools of Public Health do not receive all of the money appropriated.As a competitive program, Schools of Public Health must now compete with allprograms in health administration, environmental health, nutrition and othereducational entities offering training in the specified fields. However, wesupport Federal assistance to these programs since they greatly contribute to the needed public health manpower pool. ASPH supports the increased authorization levels in S. 799 for special project grants to Schools of Public Health. Here is the justification. Training and re- search funds are Available in certain fields such as toxicology, nutrition,occupational safety and health to partially support students and to purchase supplies and equipment. 407 401 - 10 - However, there are no categorical iunds available, except the old formula grants and the present capitation grants, that provide support for curriculum development and program support. ASPH believes that increases for special project grants would provide the basic generic support for improving the quality of the curriculum and teaching techniques and enhance the capacity of the Schools and health admin- istration programs to provide health promotion and disuse prevention as well as health services management activities in the community, state and Nation. IV.Preventive Medicine, Dentistry and Public Health ResidenciesASPH urges the Committee to re,x 't-out a provision to S. 799 that provides support for residencies in public health aid preventive medicine.Healthy People under- lined the need to increase the supply of professionals in these special practice areas.Also a recent Institute of Medicine report, 'A Manpower Policy for Primary Health Care,' made a number of recommendations including one to increase the number of residency positions in preventive medicine.The recent GMENAC report also pointed out the need for physicians in this specialty area.(See Attachment C). ASPH concurs with its sister organizations, the American College of Preventive Medicine and the American Teachers of Preventive Medicine, in their efforts to have Congress recognize the special needs of programs in preventive medicine. They maintain that if a change is to be effected in the health care system to bring about a greater emphasis on prevention, a change must be made in the attitudes and behavior of the medical profession. Medical students, and hence physicians, are not trained to understand the potential of prevention. To pro- mote an awareness of prevention within the medical profession, it is necessary to foster integration of prevention principles within federal policy regarding health manpower training. S. 799 should provide incentives to medical schools to integrate prevention within their curriculum and by providing direct support for departments of preventive medicine and residency training to students in pre- ventive medicine in Schools of Public Health. V.Continuing Education acid Health Policy and Management TrainingASPH urges the Committee to report-out a section in S. 799 that would target funds for continuing education programs designed to train en-the-job professionals in the latest developments of health policy, management, finance and administration. Recent enactment of Federal health and environmental laws, plus expanding expectations for health, increased public participation in personal and national health affairs, greater demand for competition models and improved health services management, all have created a demand for the upgrading of skills for professionals working in health promotion and disease prevention and health administration fields.According to recent reports, of the approximately 150,000 people from the public health work force, only 25 percent are graduates of Schools of Public Health or other health professional training programs. One-half of the total requires short-term re-training in order to help them keep up with the growing complexities of health programa and the ever increasing base of knowledge and technology. *1980 Report to HHS by the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC).See Attachment C. 406 402 There is an urgent need for trained policy planners and ranagers thro4ghout the health system, including many in public and private non-profit agencies and institutions that are not directly engaged in the provision of hands-on care for the ill, but do impact on the availability, quality and cost of medical care, and on health services generally, including disease prevention, health promotion, and protection of the public from hazards to health (radiation, toxic substances, air and water pollution, etc.).ASPH urges the Members to support programs that effect constructive change by widening the perspectives and increasing the management capabilities of seniorand mid-level executives and leaders who are responsible for directing healthagencies such as Wis, NSA', community health centers, hospitals, state and local health departments, environmental agencies, among others, including industrymanagers. VI.Facilities MaintenanceASPH urges the Committee to approve provisions in the health manpower act thatprovide assistance to Schools of Public Health for construction, renovation and/orrefurbishment of facilities to provide appropriate teaching and research environ-ments for students and faculty. S. 799 would support the Schools in expandingtheir programs in vital public health disciplines to incorporate the necessaryelements which ASPH maintains are so desperately needed. However, the billdoes not provide flvids for additional space requirements that would be neededif S. 799 is enacted. Present plans to terminate grants for construction and extremely limited funds for renovation of teaching facilities, ignore the implications of Federal laws, initiatives and the Surgeon General's report which will stimulate the growing demand for public health manpower. If assumptions regarding growing demands are true, the Schools of Public Health will need the construction grants in order to expand their facilities to accommodate the necessary increase in enrollments. Many of the 21 Schools of Public Health are operating at their capacity level. Expansion of enrollment to meet the growing demand will mean overcrowded and inappropriate teaching conditions.VII.Health Personnel Data and Manpower ProjectionsASPH requests extension of Section 793 of P.L. 94-484 that asks the Secretary to collect, compile and analyze data on all sectors involved in the health services delivery system. With the demands being placed on the Schoolsof Public Health to provide data to the executive and legislative branches of the Federal government, it becomes imperative that a centralized system of data collection be continued. At the present time such a system is operating andcan provide information on applicants, students, graduates, faculty researchprojects and expenditures in Schools of Public Health.Because of the need for authentic data produced in a timely fashion, federal funding is necessary to maintain surveillance on public health manpower production in the Schools of Public Health. Also, this type of data collection and surveillance needs to beextended to other schools and programs that produce specialized health manpower personnel. 4 09 403 - It -Further in an effort to monitor the ability of the production system to fillempower requirements of the wort fora, studies must be undertaken to assesspublicmanpower requirements in all sector of the health delivery system,especially in the public sector. Contrary to the other health professions(physicisans, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, veterinarians, optometrists, etc.)no federal studies have been undertaken on the need for the present. or futuresupply of public health workers. ASP4 urges the Committee to provide assistance to not only conduct studiesto determine the demand for public health personnel, but to determine the costof educating and training community and public health workers, as well as identifyingfunctional and geographic areas in which there are shortages in national priorityneeds. VIII.The Administratton's Proposal We understand that the Administration's bill will propose to end capitation butit will continue to provide limited support and curriculum development moniesto Schools of Public Health. Newt NHS reports to Congress state that a short supply of public health personnel exists in our Nation. It is surprising andconfusing. therefore, for the Administration to propose drastic reductions in Federal support to Schools of Public Health. Given the present state of the economy,certain reductions in Federal spending is Justified. However, to recommend cutsin programs that contribute to keeping individuals out of the medical are system does not make sense. Cost savings in the health can system can be achievedthrough greater emphasis (not reductions) on progress that keep people and communities healthy. IX.lymnr-xASPH urges the Committee to include references to public health in the preambleof the bill that would amend P.l. 94-4$4. ASPH suggests that the revised act becomplementary to the Surgeon General's report Healthy People: It is the thesis of this report that further improvements in thehoalth of the American people can and will be achieved .. not alonethrough increased medical care and greater health expenditures -- butthrougha renewed national commitment to efforts designed to preventdisease and to promote health. further, the preamble should note another finding in Healthy People:In the field of public health, in contrast to personal health,manpower shortages are believed to exist in some key fields,including occupational health, epidemiology. biostatistics, andhealth services administration. 4 ig 404 - 13 - In summary. the ASPH believes that continued Federal assistance is actuallyan investment at the front end of the health care system. The Schools (i.e..through their students, graduates, researchers, faculty and community serviceprograms) will not only help prevent illness but will also help slow down the rapidly escalating costs of medical care. Providing basic institutional andstudent support is a means whereby the Federal government can share the costswith state and private institutions for the training of public health personnelto manage and operate governmental health programs. Public health is a public responsibility. Schools of Public Health train personnel for public service.The Federal government has a direct interest in assuring that an adequate supplyof public health personnel is trained in Quality institutions to manage and operate thehealth delivery system in the national interest.ASPH thanks the Committee on Labor end Noun Resources for the opportunity to present its views on S. 799, the 'Health Professions and Education Assistance and Nurse Training Act of 1981.' ASPH urges favorable consideration of S. 799 withsuggestions outlined in this statement. 41j 4.liers(malims 24'aa.is148412121i406 Attachment A I-1 i storyCurrent and Dol lars19611980 ......!....*0*......-//II..4..I,.44 446\"H. 41 41 IA 10 10li 13 14 17 1411OW' Key---- CurrentDollarsConstant DollariAssociation of Schoolsof Public Health 412 406 Attachment BASSOCIATION OF SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH%Ama lif..ltahtt of the Prelisinare Data nn 1978 and 1979 Graduatesit Mtgeployment78.41 82.3$ of the graduates are saga12.8U.S of the graduates have oonZined their education5.54.2of the graduates are uaemployedType of teeloving OraaniutkolsSt.41 52.011employed granules work for tax supported orgaaisationsuch as federal.

We recognize that with federal budgetary constraints, dif-ficult choices must be made by this Committee as it establishespriorities and funding levels for health manpower programs. Duringthis review,it must be noted that while much progress has beenmade in solving the problems these programs were designed to ad-dress, much remains to be done. The progress made in ensuring awell-trained supply of health care practitioners adequate to meetthe needs of all Americans has largely been a result of federalhealth manpower programs. The tremendous gains made by medicineand the other health disciplines in increasing the quality of theiracademic, research and training programs have been due in no smallpart to the federal assistance these programs provided. Sharply escalating costs in health professional education,research and training, however, threaten both to eradicate the gainsthat nave been made and to prevent further advances. Continuingfederal assistance will be required if health professional schoolsare to continue to provide high-quality education at levels afford-able to all capable students. The problems of geographic maldistri- 4`)0 415 -2- button and lack of minority and female representation will alsocontinue to require federal assistance. As this Committee is aware, chiropractic, alone among themajor health disciplines, is not eligible for equal participationin the various federal health manpower programs. Without benefitof the federal assistance medical and other health professionalschools have received over the years, our chiropractic collegeshaveneverthelessmanaged to provide high-quality education toan increasing number of chiropractic students. The exclusion ofour schools and students from these assistance programs, however,seriously threatens our continuing capability to do so, and hasprevented the chiropractic profession from sharing in the gainsmade by those health professions receiving assistance under healthmanpower programs. The chiropractic profession faces the same problems as thosehealth disciplines included in 5.799. The IS Schools of Chiropracticwith status with the Council on Chiropractic Education are sufferingfrom the same financial pressures and developmental problems as arethe other health professional schools; the 8,902 students currentlyenrolled in schools of chiropractic must likewise bear the bruntof rising tuition costs and limited financial aid resources; andthe chiropractic profession has not been able to share in the pro-gress made by other health professional groups in meeting the pro-blems of geographic maldistribution and inadequate female and min-ority representation within the profession. Exclusion of chiropractic from these programs has been incon-sistent with the federal government's recognition of chiropractic 42.E 416 -3- services under a number of federal health programs, includingMedicare and Medicaid. In addition to this federal support, chiro-practic has been accorded recognition by both state and localgovernments and the private sector, and enjoys widespread accep-tance among members of the public. Demand for chiropractic servicesis growing, and there is evidence to suggest that demand for suchservices may well outstrip supply. Clearly, the federal governmenthas a role to play in ensuring top quality chiropractic education. As this Committee is aware, the Senate voted last year toinclude chiropractic in its legislation reauthorizing health pro-fessions programs. We again urge this Committee to act favorablyon the inclusion of chiropractic In the health manpower legislationit ultimately adopts. This year will no doubt see reductions infederal outlays for health manpower. Existing inequities, however,must not be allowed to continue under the rubric of 'budgetaryconstraints.\" The exclusion of chiropractic, althougn perhaps atestament to the American Medical Association's lobbying intensity,has not been in the best interests of our health are economy.Equal participation by all health professionals for the federalmonies that will remain available is, we think, the surest way tolower health care costs through a truly competitive market forhealth professional services. Therefore, we respectfully suggest that all involved will pro-fit substantially by Federal support of chiropractic education: ThePublic, by being able to serve its increasing demand for chiropractichealth care; The Economy, by returning impared workers back to thejob more quickly thereby increasing productivity and profit, and 422 417 -4- ila Federal Government, by expending less funds, on a cost-benefitanalysis, for chiropractic as a less expensive health care alter-native. THE ECONQMICS OF CHIROPRACTIC CARE Based on size and on the number of practitioners and patientvisits, chiropractic is the second largest health care service inthe United States. The 23.000 practicing Got4rs of Chiropractichad approximately 122.5 million patient visits in 1979. generatingover $1.3 billion in practice revenues. Chiropractors are a li-censed and officially recognized health profession in all fiftystates plus the District of Columbia. All fifty states authorizechiropractic services as part of their workman's compensation pro-gram. In the private sector, virtually all major commercial healthand accident insurance policies provide for chiropractic services.Substantial numbers of major international, national and localunions include chiropractic services in their health and welfareplans and many industries such as General Motors, Firestone, etc.pay for chiropractic care for t pir employees. The federal government has likewise recognized and authorizedchiropractic services under Medicare. Medicaid, vocational rehabil-itation programs, Longshoremen and Harbour Workers' CompensationAct, Internal Revenue Code (as a medical deduction). For federalemployees, chiropractic services are covered under federal employeeshealth benefits programs and in federal employees workers' compen-sation. Federal funding of chiropractic has also been provided underappropriation measures sent to the Department of Health and Human 42 418 -5- Services and for a statistical survey of the chiropractic pro-fession undir the Health Manpower Act. The U.S. Department ofEducation officially recognized the Council on Chiropractic Ed-ucation as an accrediting agency for chiropractic educationalinstitutions. Fueled by both government and private sector support, thedemand for chiropractic services continues to grow. Evidenceexists to suggest that the demand for chiropractic services farexceeds the supply. For example, in 1978 the ratio of Doctors ofChiropractic to population was approximately 10.3 per 100,000population. The 1980 F.A.C.T.S. study, conducted and financed bythe federal government. estimated that a ratio of 14.1 per 100.000population was needed in order to satisfy existing demand for chiro-practic services. Assuming the I4.1 ratio to be an appropriatestandard, one Doctor of Chiropractic would be required per 7092,as opposed to the current supply of one chiropractor per 9709. A recent study in the state of Iowa revealed 'that while the ratioof Doctors of Chiropractic was already 23.2 per 100,000 populationin 1979, the demand for chiropractic services remained high; Thissuggests that the 14.1 ratio may indeed be a conservative estimate.Further indication that demand has not been satisfied comes from anannual survey by the American Chiropractic Association. In 1972,when there were approximately 15.000 chiropractors, the average num-ber of patient visits per week was 107.1. In 1980. with a substantialgrowth in the number of active chiropractors, the number of patientvisits per week wal exactly the same 007.1), indicating an evergrowing demand for chiropractic services. 419 -6- The supply and demand problem is further compounded by theserious geographic maldistribution of chiropractors across thecountry. Ineligible for the National Health Service Corps andother health manpower programs designed to correct distributionof health practitioners, maldistribution among chiropractors isperhaps the most severe of all major health disciplines. For ex-ample, while there are 23.2 chiropractors per 100,000 populationin Iowa there are .9 chiropractors per 100,000 population in theDistrict of Columbia. The meldistribution problem is regional also.The New England States have 6.8 per cent of the nation's chiroprac-tors while the western states compose 15.2% of the practitioners. Chiropractors function as primary care health providers inmany instances and as such play a significant role in servicingrural underserved areas of this country. Fifty-two percent ofchiropractors practice in communities of less than 50,000 popu-la'n. Perhaps a more telling statistic is that thirty-two per-cent of all chiropractors practice in areas of 24,000 or less pop-ulation. It is the smaller communities that have traditionally beenneglected by other health care providers. The chiropractic profes-sion has been attempting to respond to this need. Assessing the role of chiropractic continues to be difficultbecause of the lack of data on chiropractic in our health careeconomy. Research does suggest that chiropractic care, as comparedwith alternative treatment modes. can be a less costly way to treatsubstantially identical health problems. For example, in a studyof official data from State Workman's Compensation claims, it was found 425 420 -7- that chiropractic care was 1/3 less costly than medical care forsimilar ailments. A 1972 California study by C. Richard Wolf, N.D.also found that chiropractic care returned the impaired worker backto the job more rapidly than medical treatment, thus reducing busi-ness costs and increasing worker productivity. The lack of data on chiropractic can be linked in some degreeto chiropractic's exclusion from health manpower and other researchand training programs. For example, the chiropractic professionhas thusfar been excluded from the Department of Health and HumanServices cngoing data collection activities. Yet the informationsuch data provide is crucial not only to the future development ofchiropractic, but to an assessment of its' contribution in servingthe health care needs of our nation. We are pleased to see 5.799'srecognition of the importance of these activities in Section 107'sauthorization of HHS's data collection activity in the health per-sonnel area. We request that chiropractic be included in these ac-tivities. The National Advisory Council on Health Personnel also has animportant role to play in assessing and developing the future roleof health personnel in our health care economy. Again, despite theenormous role chiropractic has played and will continue to play inthat economy. the profession has thusfar not been represented on theCouncil. The Council cannot in any realistic way perform its functionby continuing to ignore the existence of one of the largest healthdisciplines. We therefore support 5.799'sexpansion of the Coun-cil, and urge that chiropractic be included among its members. 426 421 -8- In sum. great strides in professional improvement have beenmade. We acknowledge our advancements but with very real concernexpress our failure to acheive some of the goals this legislationaddresses. The chiropractic profession is dedicated to servicingAmerica's health needs. We agree with the American Medical Assoc-iation on the partnership role that the health professions and thefederal government share towards a goal of providing high qualityhealth care. We applaud the statement made by a representative ofthe A.M.A. in testimony before the U.S. House Energy and CommerceSubcommittee on Health and the Environment on March 12, 1981: 'TheA.M.A. is committed to seeing that financial recources are availableto qualified aspiring health professionals.\" STUDENT ASSISTANCE The over 8,000 students enrolled in the 15 Schools of Chiro-practic recognized by the Council on Chiropractic Education mustsuccessfully complete a rigorous educational program in order toearn a Doctor of Chriopractic degree. After a minimum of two yearspre-professional training (the two year requirement of professionaltraining is similar to dental school) incorporating the prescribedcontent of science courses, chiropractic colleges require a minimumof four academic years of professional relident study. In additionto passing the licensing board examination in all states, the Doctorof Chiropractic must pass the Basic Science Board examination: (in-cluding anatomy, physiology, pathology, bacteriology, chemistry, andpublic health) in four states and the District of Columbia. This isthe equivalent examination given to M.D.s and D.D.s. 4 2 71 422 -9- While the tuition and fee levels at chiropractic colleges arerelatively inexpensive in comparison with other doctorate-levelhealth professional schools, the rising costs of chiropractic educa-tion are an onerous burden which even many of our higher-incomestudents are finding increasingly difficult to bear. Rising costsand ineligibility for health professions scholarships and loan pro-grams have greatly skewed our student body. Despite recruitmentefforts, women comprise only 17 percent of the students at chiro-practic colleges, with minority groups comprising less than 1 per-cent. Foreign students represent approximately 4.5 percent of thestudent population. The disproportionate representation of the af-fluent in our chiropractic colleges has, of course, affected thechiropractic profession generally, which has traditionally beenlargely white and rale. The recent gains made by the health professions included in5. 799in increasing female and minority participation is direct-ly linked to the federal student assistance programs that have beenmade available to health professional students. Only through federalassistance have students in other health disciplines been able tomeet the enormous costs of health educations; only through federalassistance have health professional schools been able to recruitwomen and-minorities in increasing numbers. That the wealthy and thewhite remain disproportionately represented in chiropractic collegesis a testament to chiropractic's exclusion over the years from healthmanpower scholarship and loan programs. While our chiropractic col-leges have on their own make enormous strides in this regard, lack 42? 423 -10- of financial resources have prevented them from improving to anacceptable degree the economic and racial mix of students enter-ing the profession. All capable students, regardless of their sex,race or family financial resources, must be allowed to pursue achiropractic education. We strongly support continued funding of the Health EducationAssistance Loan (HEAL) and the Health Professions Student Loans(HPSL) programs, and we request that chiropractic students be al-lowed to compete for these funds on an equal footing with the otherhealth disciplines. We also strongly support the program of assis-tance to individuals from disadvantaged beckgrounds detailed inSection 168 of S. 799. This program is essential if capablestudents from low-income backgrounds are to be able to enter thehealth professions. The chiropractic profession is committed to im-proving the income and racial mix of our students. Our inclusionin these programs is crucial to the success of that committment. INSTITUTIONAL ASSISTANCE We agree with the premise of this legislation that health pro-fessional schools are a national resource that continue to bear aspecial responsibility in solving the health care needs of this na-tion. Accomplishing this goal, however, requires that schools befinancially stable. All of our chiropractic colleges are private, freestanding in-stitutions; they are neither public institutions with the governmentas a primary funder nor are they parts of universities upon which 420 424 they can rely for financial support. Schools of chiropractic re-ceive virtually no government support from either federal, stateor local sources. As a result, many of our schools are dangerouslyclose to bankruptcy. They must rely for funds solely on ongoingcampaigns for philanthropic support and on tuition and fees. Tui-tion and fees in fact comprise nearly 70. of our colleges operatingincomes, a figure sharply contrasting with the 9.9% average for thetight other health professional groups covered by federal assis-tance programs. These funding sources serve merely to maintain thestatus quo and keep chiropractic colleges solvent. Little if anyof our funds remain available for special projects, improvements offacilities, continuing education, advanced clinical training, orrecruitment of women and minority students. Yet, the funding needs of our colleges are so large, and theneed for new programs and improvements so great, that only throughsome form of additional federal support can these needs be met. Ourteaching facilities are in particular need of renovation and capi-tal improvements. Many of our colleges were constiucted years ago,and are both inadequate for modern quality chiropractic educationand are unable to meet the needs of a str4ent body growing in sizeSatellite clinical centers are needed to provide not only a qualityclinical experience for our students, but to provide services to manyof our underserved and elderly citizens who travel great distancesto receive care at our present clinics. The exclusion Af chiropracticfrom federal assistance places the profession at a serious disad-vantage in the maintenance of quality education. This exclusion isneither consistent with the many federal programs which include chiro-practic services, nor is it in the best interests of this country's 43 o -12- health care delivery system.426 We therefore strongly support continued funding of the fed-eral loan guarantees and interest subsidies programs, and we urgethe Committee to allow chiropractic schools to )articipate on anequal basis for this federal assistance. Likewise, we support re-authorization of the financial distress grant program. Chiropracticcolleges are not immune to the burden of inflation nor to the pro-blem of maintaining accredidation in the face of steeply risingeducational costs. Chiropractic colleges facing serious financialdifficulty should be allowed to participate in the financial dis-tress grant program. We support continued funding for Area Health Education Centers(AHEC), and urge the inclusion of all health professionals, includ-ing chiropractic, in this program. Likewise, we support grant pro-grams to schools providing support services to health professionalspracticing in underserved areas. The Chiropractic profession hasa long history of service in underserved rural areas; the poor andthe elderly have traditionally been the most dependent users ofchiropractic care. Our colleges would be most anxious to initiateprograms to provide needed care to the underserved and elderly whoare far removed from our present clinics and teaching facilities.Lack of funding has prevented the establishment of such services inthe past. Inclusion of chiropractic in AHEC and grant support pro-grams for underserved areas would go far in both maintaining qualitychiropractic education and to providing much needed services. 431 426 WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY 408''4%BOWMAN GRAY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE40.300 loath Hawobonse Road WiattosSaltme.

April 1. 1981 The Honorable William HefnerU.S. House of Represented Nes2161 Rayburn BuildingWashington, D.C.20515Dear Mr. Hefner.Ithas come to our attention. through material that we have received fromprofessional societies to which we belong, viz., the Society of Teachers of FamilyMedicineandtheAmericanAcademyofFamilyPhysicians,that President Reagan has recommended a marked and serious reduction in familymedicinefundsforresidency,undergraduate,andfacultydevelopment programs for FY 81 under Section 786 of the Health Manpower Act. An example of the immediate concern we have. is the Hatch Bill, S.799. In FY 82 itis anticipated that grants for family medicine residency, undergraduate.and faculty development programs will be reduced by 516 million dollars, from536.450,000 to 520.450,000.A reduction of this magnitude at this time willsignificantly imperial the progress and viability of educational programs infamily practice in North Carolina. Additionally, and of serious import to the viability of family medicine, the President has proposed for FY 82 that allprimarycare programs(familymedicine.generalinternalmedicine,and general pediatrics) be consolidated inasingle budgetitemof 536 million dollars. He did not - and this is important - spell out what portion would beallocated to family medicine. Grants t., department of family medicine (Section780) would not be included in the above budget item, but they would bereduced from 59.5 million dollarsto 58.0 milliondollarsfor FY 82,a 16 percent reduction.The Hatch Hill calls for an even more severe reduction to57.0 million dollar*.We appreciate very much the efforts that are being exerted in getting our cou,ntry on an even keel. However,there are programs.e.g..training family physicians. which are, without question, cost effective. A large cadre of well trained family physicians can improve the overall quality of health care inour country, and equally important, such a cadre can be effective inreducing the overall costof medical carein this country.Though these reductions may have some immediate salutary effect on the budget problemsfacing the Administration and the Congress. the long term effect may well bearesultantincreaseinthe national cost of health care delivery. Itis indisputable that alternative delivery systems, viz., pre-paid groups (IPA's, 432 427 The Honorable Mr. HefnerApril 1, 1201Page 2 11140's), cannot be cost-effective without the active participation of generalists(familyphysicians.inparticular.andgeneralinternistsandgeneral pediatricians) in the delivery of the large bulk of health services. Familyphysicians should be the cornerstone of our American health care deliverysystem.In 1970 there were only seven departments and 16 divisions of family medicinein 101 American academic medical centers; in 1980 there were 97 departmentsand 11 divisions of family medicine in our academia medical centers. In 1973 only 53 residents in family medicine completed a residency training program;in1980 there were 1.846 graduates that brought the 10 year total of familypractice graduates to 8,579. This phenomenal growthisdue,inlarge measure, to appropriate funding of family medicine by state legislatures andthe federal government.Any reduction infederal and state support for family medicine will have srThmediate deleterious effect on the viability offamily practice residency traiiaiTir programs and other educational endeavorsinfamily medicine.Itis our strong belief thatitwill take another two decades, at the current effort level, to train an appropriate number of familyphysicians that are necessary for the support of a health care system. The GMENAC report generally supports this contention. An increase in state and federal support is needed - not a devastating decrease. Such a decrease will send a signal to academic medical centers that will say in effect, \"Go aheadwith your traditional training of technically oriented subspecialists; the nationand the Congress arereallynot interested in having more primary care physicianstrained; expensive hospital emergency rooms can be cur triagemechanism; available, continuous, comprehensive, . and personal family healthcare is a pipe dream; the efforts to change the professional distribution ofhealth care professionals, e.g., training more family physicians, which wasbegun in the late 60's and accelerated in the early 70's, were inappropriate;we should have stayed with the status quo.\"We do not believe these are the messages you want to send to our academicmedical centers;yet thatisprecisely how the traditionalists in academic medical centers will react to Any cut in funding for family medicine, whetheritisinSection780orerection786oftheHealthManpowerAct.

We - family medicine -are thenew boy on the block;they are threatened by the entry of familymedicine into their traditional territories.Turning back the clock to the subspecialization era of the 50'a and 60'a would,intheir view, be most desirable!But is this what the nation needs? is this what you want' 83-520 0-81--2843r, 428 The Honorable William HefnerApril 1, 11131Page 3 Instead of a out in funding for family medicine by 44 percent, an Increase of 15-20 percent is sorely needed. Instead of retrenchment, advancement is needed.Instead of more technically oriented subspecialists, more personalphysicians are needed.We and our faculties, as have other family medicinedepartment chairmen and faculties, have done and are doing our bit by giving up our private practices to accept faculty appointments In family medicine at income levels and levels of financial security less than those found In the private sector.Therefore, we fair rot for our own security; our concern is for the people whom you and we serve in our own ways.If family practice is to survive - if the specialty of family medicine is to be able to fully mature into an established discipline within our academic medical centers and appropriate community hospitals - then family medicine urgentlyneeds your help and the help of your colleagues in the Congress. If you feel we can be of help in this endeavor, rest assure that we will do anything, go anywhere, and work as hard as necessary in order to gather support for thiscornerstone of American medicine.

I submit my statement in testimony of my beliefs as well as my concerns for the nursing profession.Thank you for your interest and efforts on nursing'sbehelf. enclosure:Sincerely, Margaret Mastal, R.N., M.S.N.CoordinatorHuman Resources Development 435 430 Hr. Chairman, the Committee on Labor and Human Resources iscurrently focusing on a vital issue: the Health ProfessionsEducational Assistance and Nurse Training Act of 1981. Thecurrent shortage of nurses and other problems within thenursing profession are pertinent topics when considering fundingfor education.A recent study, \"Why Nurses Leave Nursing andWhat Can Be Done About It,\" published in the American Journal ofNursing., January 1981 provides a summary of the problems as wellas insight into their solutions. This investigation revealsthat many of the problems arise from within the profession andmust be resolved by nurses themselves and our professional org-anizations.For example, nurses are dissatisfied with salariesand fringe benefits, inadequate administrative support, unnecessaryorganizational tasks, and inexplicit state laws governing practice.These problems are outside the jurisdiction of the federal gov-ernment; rather, they belong to nursing. However, this study,which surveyed 3500 nurses, also revealed that nurses are dis-satisfied with the lack of opportunities for continuingeducation and the availability of inservice educational programs.These dissatisfiers are occurring at the same time that theAmerican Nurses' Association has adopted a position that thebaccalaureate degree be the basic preparation for entry intoprofessional practice. Further, there is a trend among thestates to mandate continuing education as a requisite for re-licensure.Nurses provide the greatest protion of direct health care andare inadequately compensated and recognized for their services. 436 431 Low salaries do not support nurses in their efforts to continuetheir education and increase their professional capabilities.Theproposed radical cuts in the budget for nursing education andadvanced nurse training can only compound a painful situation.However. nursing educational funding must be limited if thenational economic issues are to be resolved. Perhaps, as acompromise between nursing's dilemma, the health of the citizenry,and national economic interests. the proposed cuts to nursingeducation should stand but not on such a radical basis. Untilnursing can resolve its own economic and other internal problems,we ask you to support our education efforts so that nurses canremain professionally competent.

A 1977 HEY-fundedstudy revealed that more than 61 percent of the nation's practicing registerednurses(RNs) were employed in the hospital setting.It is clear that, despitealternative delivery systems and other employment opportunities, the majority oftoday's nurses work in hospitals. Hospitals have begun to address the problems of nursing shortages in a con-structive manner and ars attempting to develop innovative solutions.

Hospitals alsohave applied management engineering techniques to the problems of nurse ached -ulIng.In some institutions. computer - assisted nurse scheduling system havemaximized the ability of their administrations to apply nursing resources mostproductively, accommodate shift preferences, and minimize scheduling conflicts. In addition, the AHA has recently initiated National Comaisaion on Nursing.which is an autonomous forum of national leaders In nursing, hospital manage-sent, medicine, goverment. acagesia, and business. The comaission--charteredforthroe-year periodis composed of 30 commissioners serving as eitherindividual ambers or representatives of organizations. The health-relatedorganizations represented on the commission are the American Association ofColleges of Nursing, American Hospital Association, American Medical Associa-tion, Asarican Nurses' Associatun (ANA), American Society for Nuesing ServiceAdministrators. Assembly of Hospital Schools of Nursing, National Council ofHospital Governing Boards, National League for Nursing (MN), and the Divisionof Nursing of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The commission has three interrelated and overlapping activities: collectingdata and infonmaion, formulating recommendations, and developing practical 4 40 .435 4 action plans.One of the commission's major tools for collecting data andinformation has been series of public hearings held across the country. Thepublic hearings provide opportunities for broad range of individuals andorsanIxations at the grace -roots level to aid in identifying and defining pro-blems and issues. Other data collection methods include reviewing currentliterature and existing studies and collecting reports of ongoing programs andprojectsthatare designed toimprove nursing and nursing practice.

It may alsoprove to be useful to public and private entities which have as interest in suchinformation.The recommendations will lead to the development of action plansthat will provide practical solutions for institutions and organizationsconfronting nursing problems. The Nursing Shortage While there are aggregate increases in the total supply of health professionalsin certain fields, especially in nursing, hospitals ate exptrtencing severe andchronic shortages. AMA-ember hospitals Indies:* that they have between 90,000and 100,000 nursing vacancies, and SO percent of the nation's hospitals are saidto have unfilled nursing positions. Recent information from state hospital associations confirm these stet:sties.For example: oIn October 1980, the Indiana &natal Association reported that thevacancy rate for nurses in Indiana hospitals was 11 percent for 1980,2.6 percent higher than the previous year. Overall,the nurseshortage is sore severe in large urban areas. Shortages of nurses arealso more revere in larger hospitals, with those having more than 150beds reporting a vacancy Tate of 12.5 percent. compared to a 5.3percent rate in hospitals with fewer than 150 beds. The Cary area hasthe highest vacancy rate in the state, at 22 percent, followed by theIndianapolis area at 15.2 percent. Hospitals in Indianapolis and its 441 436 5 adjoining countits hired 550 more ItNs in 1980 than in 1979. but werestillshort by 653 nurses. Evansville area hospitals reported avacancy rate of 9.8 percent. 1.2 percentage points below the statewidefigure, while the Tort Wayne area's vacancy rate vas 4.7 percent. Thelover vacancy rota in the Evansville and Tort Wayne areas can bepartially attributed to thepresence of four of Indiana's sixhospital-based diploma schools of nursing. In March 1980, the Ohio Hospital Association reported that, of 15.249full-time budgeted EN staff nurse positions in Ohio, 1,512 or 10percent vets vacant. Of the 7,248 part-time budgeted IN staff posi-tions. 932 or 12.9 percent vete vacant. In July 1980. the North Carolina Hospital Association reported thatNorth Carolina needed 1.300 additional full-time RNs, 522 additionalfull-timeLrms.198part -timeRNs.and108 part-time LP8s. oIn February 1980, the Maryland Hoopltal Association reported thatMaryland's community hospitals acre experiencing a 14 percent shortageand an approximate 29 percent annual job turnover rate among Via andLille.The specific turnover rate of RNs vu 32 percent and for LPNe.27 percent. oIn September 1980. the Illinois Hospital Association reported 4.982vacant RN staff positions (13.4 percent) sod 1,365 vacant LPN staffpositions (12.1 percent) in Illinois. Regional data indicate thatChicago has the highest 'tenancy rate in the state. oto May 1980. tne Florida Hospital Association reported 2,520 vacant RNpositions and 904 vacant LPN positions in Florida. According to the Department of Labor's Bureau of Leber StatiatiCS. of job open-ings inthe health care field in the 19802 up to 50 percent will be fornursesapproximately 83.000 annual openings for RNs. Hospitals are not onlyconcerned about the present shortage, but also about the future availability of 4.12 437 6 nursing personnel. Even though job opportunities abound, not enough people aregoing into nursing. The number of graduating declined 2 percent in1979--the first such occurrence in 10 years --and another 24 percent in 1980,according to data from the KU. With the rate of unemployment for nurses--also 2 percentremaining far below the norms for other categoric' of comparableprofessionals, the league predicts that the current nursing shortage Will becomeeven worse In the near future. The factors underlying the shortage of professional nurses in hospitals arenumerous enddiverse.Mursing must compete with a variety of other careeropportunities which have become increasingly available in recent years. :Even inthe profession of nursing, nurses have the opportunity for greater diversi-ficationr-into industrial health, health promotion, community health centers,and clinics, for example -which hive provided the profession with greater oppor-tunities for mobility and career advancement as well as more convenient workhours. Compounding the problem is the trend toward shorter lengths of stay by moreacutely ill patients requiring more technologically complex nursing care. Thecreation of Intensive care units and specialized services within hospitals hasresulted in an increased demand for kgs, as have changes in the utilizationpatterns of hospitals, with shorter stays reflecting a greater focus on theplanning of admissions and discharges and greater use of outpatient facilities. The effectiveness of such special care units will be severely compromised ifsufficient *webers of well-trained hospital nurses are not available. Thepressures felt by hospital nurses Are compounded by the trend to a more medi-cally intensive hospital caseload. The demands on nurses are not simply phy-sical and 'natal, but their emotional resources are called upon as well. Theirability to meet many demands is taxed by prolonged understaffiug, in situationsin which hospitals are unable to recruit nurses.Hospitals arc, therefore,coo erned 'hata persistently inadequate supply will compound the existingproblem by further discouraging active nurses and increasing the potential forwhat has been called \"burnout.\" 443 438 7 All ourchasers of health care, public and private, bear a portion of the costsassociated with the nursing shortage. Certainly one of the most important, yetleast quantifiable, of these costs is the effect of shortage of resources onthe health ofthe nation.As we have noted, the mission of the hospital, sscentral component of our health delivery system, is dependent on an adequatesupply of nurses, not only to support new health care technolo,ies but also topromote efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of basic health services. Other costs, which can be quantified to some extent, are significant, not onlyin their absolute &mounts, but oleo in the context of opportunities foregone ina time of scarce economic resources. Tor example, many hospitals unable toobtain permanent nursing staff have responded by using nurse registries assources oftemporary personnel. This extensive use of registry nursau sub-stantially increasan the cost of providing care to hospital patients because thefees paid to registries far exceed the total of salaries and fringe benefitspaidto permanent employees. In Chicago, more than $7 million was spent in oneyear for temporary nursing personnel. This figure understates the magnitude ofthe problem since it does rot include the hidden costs involved in the constantorientation process that isneededto enable these nurses to function inparticular hospital environments. In addition, expenses incurred by hospitals to recruit nurses from other fieldsandto attractinactive nurses into the hospital setting have risen. Theaverage hospital recruitment budget has risen 63 percent in the past 'tar. Toteach nurse who leaves, the National Association of Nurse Recruitersestimates that a hospital spends from 5150 to $4,000, with an average of $1,000,to recruitreplacement.Hospitals unable to obtain permanent staff have oftenresponded to nursing shortages by using nurse registries--services that providepools of temporary nursing personnel. In response to survey conducted by theANAin January1979,35 state hospital associations reported that memberinstitutions have become increasingly reliant on temporary nurses for theirnursing departments. As would be expected. nursing salaries also are rising with growing demand. Real 4.14 439 8 vases for t14 recently have !amassed at a faster rate than real wages for allnon-supervisory workers in the privet, sector. In addition, many hospitals havebegun special compensation incentives for weekend and night work. For example,a *two day alternative\" in sass hospitals offers nurses 36 hours of pay for 24hours of weekend day shift work and 40 hours of pay for 24 hours of weekendnight shift work. Other hospitals are paying $17 an bola to lles on the nightshift. In addition, the shortage of professional nurses will have serious consequencesfor the physical well-being of the growing elderly population.Americans over.65 account for 23 percent of hospital discharges and 35 percent of totalhospitaldays;they experience 50percentlongerlengths-of-stay andconprtively higher surgery rate. According to HMS, the 65-and-older group is the fastest growing segment of theAmerican population. Sy the year 2039, there will be sore than 50 millionAmericans 65 years or older--an estimated 17 percent of the total population inthat year.This sharp rise in the number of older Americans will havedra..antic effect on utilization of hospital and nursing home care.Projected trendsfor short-stay hospital days of care, reported by the National Center for HealthStatistics Hospital Discharge Survey, show that during the next 25 years, totaldays per year will increase from 36 to 47 percent, with 12 to 20 percent of theincrease due to the aging of the population. The provision of health care for the older-age group will, of necessity, beshared among all health professionals within the delivery systes; however, thegreatestrespoosiblity will undoubtedly fall to nurses, who must attend topatients' daily needs. Hence, there is likely to be an even greater need forspecially trained nurses to meet the unique medical requires:int, or the elderly,whose demands for restorative, maintenance. and palliative taro are greater thanthose ofthe general population. for couple, four out of five older personahave at least one chronic di Of tha 81 percent who have chronic condi-tions, 46 percent experience activity limitations; 40 percent are limited inmajor activities. Moreover, the nt and implementation of appropriateplans ofcare for elderly patients are sore difficult because variety of 445 440 9 physiological and psychosocial factors must be taken into conelderation. Suchfactors deepen the severity of the nursing shortage. Guidelines for Federal Support Is view of the current and projected nursing shortage, the ANA believes thatfederal support for nursing education should continue. Consequently, whileaddressing the IfttG issue, the ANA is focusing its comments on certain programaunder Title II, Nurse Training, in 5.799, the health manpower bill before thisCommittee.In our opinion, the priorities for funding should be in the 7ollow-ing ordert(1) student assistance, (2) special pro3ect grants, (5) advancednurse training programme, and (A) institutional support. Student Assistance The ANA believes that student loans and scholarships should be continued at thecurrent feeding level in order to assist students who may otherwise not be ableto complete their education. Section 212 of 8.799 proposes to elininate theexisting scholarship grant program for nursing education. and the bill wouldprovide no new authorisation for existins student loan funds. Instead, Section208 of the bill would amend current law to persit all nursing students to applyfor loans under the National Defense Education Act of 1955. In view of theextreme need for support of nursing education, ANA opposes changes in thescholarship grant and loan programa and urges their continued funding at currentauthorisation levels. Me believe that Section 2011 of the bill is meritorious inthat it would open an avenue of support ass currently is not available tonursing students. However, by itself, the WOG loan program will be insuffi-cient to compensate for proposed uhangs in the scholarship grant and loanprogram, because coepetitioo for liaised funding will make if difficult fornursing education to receive the priority it deserves. l4holarships have been awarded in schools of nursing to those in greatest fi-nancial need; such students frequently come from backgrounds that sake it diff-icult for then to borrow from the private sector. Moreover, such students arenot in positions both to support themselves through part-time Jobe and, if 4 41 6 10 course requirements dictate, to pursue needed remedial and supplementary pro-srams. Data obtained from the NU publication. *Vary into Nursing. fart II.\" indicatethat the most significant determinants of student's decision to apply toparticular *using program are the cost of the program and availability offinancial aid. Currently, one in every three applicants asks for financialassistance. An analysis of federal student assistance for fiscal Year 1974 showed at 20percent of nutting scholarship* were awarded to black students,proportion inexcess of the 2.5 percent of black nurses in active practice.The most recentfigures from the MIDI show a decrease in enrollments for both minority and malestudents in basic nursing programs. Cessation of scholarship funding wouldcertainly reinforce this trend. In addition. many cursing schools report to us that up to 80 percent of theirstudent bodies may be dependent on soma form of student assistance. withfederal t bodies may be dependent on eons form of student assistance. with fed-eral !unclips supplying a aignificant proportion of that aid.Tuition costs fornursing students also tend to be high in comparison with tuition costs foreducational programs in the liberal arts. because frequently there are labora-tory fees. costs of transportation to clinical sites. and exceptionally highteacher/ student ratios in comparison with other undergraduate programs. Thewithdrawal of federal student assistance funding would be particularly hard onprivate nursing schools in states where public funds are available only forstate institutions. Special Project Grants The ABA is pleased that 5.799 proposes to extend authority for special projectirnts.The Association supports the continuation of such greats at currentauthoriasticm levels in order to increase the supply or improve the distributionby geogrsphic area of adequately trained personnel; to provide more opportun- 4 41,1 a 11442 ities for disadvantaged or improve curricula. includingthose for padiatric, obstetric. and geriatric nursing. The Association commands the chairman for including in S.799 spacial consider-ation for projects that would (1) promote carter articulation or nurses whowant to move up the professional ladder; (2) encourage mergers between hospitaland collegiate schools of nursing; and (3) enhance the clinical training ofnursingstudents.especiallythroughinternships/preceptorships and\"reality-based\" (i.e.. 24-hour) experiences, and provide opportunities fornursing faculty to upgrade their clinical skills, especially via short-termtraineeships.The special project grant section should focus on programs thatencourage recruitment and retention strategies involving hospitals an! schoolsof nursing. Below is a list of some possible examples. Career articulation: Special projects designed to encourage motility.One ofthe sajor problems that exists today in nursing education is the lack ofa standard. articulated ladder that would enable most nurses to progressfrom entry level up to the highest level through a recognised hierarchy ofsteps.In fact. a direct educational ladder does exist for sone nurseswho enter the system by earning a baccalaureate degree in nursing (BM. arethen qualified to enter a master's program leading to a nursing degree, andprogress todoctoral degree in nursing. However, because the vest majority ofpracticing nurses today, sad the majority of nurses entering the profession inany given year. do not hold baccalaureate degree. taey are excluded fromimmediate access to advanced educational opportunities. For nurses who wish to progress through the educational system, the baccalau-reate degree is the gateway to advanced programs. A nurse who undertakes basiceducational preparation for practical, associate degree, or diploma programlacks such a gateway. in that his or her academic credits generally do not applytowards a baccalaureate degree. Federal funding of spacial project grants designed to promote career articula-tion would have the following benefits: 4 ,18 443 12 (1)Nurses seeking higher education would be qualified to move through thesystem in an orderly way.(2)All previous educational experiences in nursing would earn academiccredit.(3)laploying institutions would have a more highly qualified work poolavailable to them and a staff potentially sore able to satisfy theirindividual career aspiration.(4)Public and private funding for nursing education would be sore effec-tively utilized if earned credits were transferable among programs.(5)Both individual nurses and employers would benefit if uniform ex-pectations and skills were adopted for each level of education withina single system. Mergers between hospitals and collegiate schools of nursing: Special projectgrant money should be used where appropriate to encourage hospital-bared schoolsof nursing to merge with collegiate schools of nursing. It is our belief that.when cooperative arraosements exist to facilitate the integration of new pro-fessionals into the wet., place, the retention of such profess/ousts is hibner.Such systems include Joint appointments for clinical nurses as cadesdc facultymembers, supervised preceptorship and internship programs. and other such formalreltiooships between academic and service institutions to help close the widelyidentified gap between the education and service programs. Recent mergers have shown the following benefits! (1)The values and particular virtues of the hospital school are main-tained.(2)Students in schools that have merged with academic institutions aremere easily accorded credit for general education coursevork and fornursing courses.(3)The frustrations of RNs seeking to enter higher education levels areavoided.(4)The hospital that continues to serve as site for clinical instruc-tion potentially has the chance to recruit for its own labor forceamong the students of the program. 44f) 83-520 O- 81 - -29 444 13 Clinical education: Special projects designed to encourage clinical education.Federal assistance for clinical education programs to both basic and advancednurse training program Is crucial. According to hospital administrators, manybasic education programs do not place sufficient emphasis on clinical Ireland,which oust then be provided on the job. Exposure to such training may alsomotivate students to choose the hospital setting as a work environment untocompletion of their basic programa. Moreover, because of the increase in tech-nology and the development of special can units, clinical training is essentialat the advanced level to prepare nurses to sect the challenges of specialisednursing In the hospital setting. Advanced Nurse Training The ANA continue to support advanced nurse training programs which providefunding for three major categories: preparation of nursing faculty, the qualityof whoa hasdirect effect on the quality of care given by students to pa-tients; managerial education for supervisory and administrative nurses, most ofwhen presently rely on on-the-job training; and advanced training in specialtyareas.Programs for training nursing adniniatrtore are particularly importantbecause a lack of nursing service adnintstrators, combined with the sometimesinadequate management training of many nurses serving in adniniatrative capaci-ties, has contributed to the growing dissatisfaction and subsequent shortage ofnurses. Advanced nurse training program should be offered on a part-time, as well as ona full-time basis. since many prospective enrollees must contin,e to work tomeet personal financial needs. Advanced nurse training funds can encourage thedevelopment of innovative work/ study progress. Tor example. a programdeveloped jointly by the ANA and the University of Illinois School of Nursingcould be replicated in other places with advanced nurse training funds. Theprogram enables practicing nursing service adninistratore 0 combine theircontinuing work experiences with alternating residential sessions, featuringself-learning modules supplemented by local preceptor's instruction. Such aprogram. adopted nationwide, would help Peet the urgent need for more formallyeducated management nurses in hospitals. Such courses should be credit-carryingto enable student to attain degree status by consolidating coursework. 4 30 14 Inatitutimal Support445 1.799 proposes to eliminate isatitutloesl 'assort. ASA recommends that anyreduction in federal institutional mapport should he a gradual and orderlyprocess that will not jeopardise the viability of existing programa.

Should federal support for capitation grant& to schools of nursing be coati:cued.the ANA exam that the support be provided to all three basic nutell41 programs:diploma. amoelata degree, and baccalaureate degree.

FORZICN WED/CAL CSADUAIES Although S.799 dose not currently address the MC issue, the ANA recommends thatlanguage be added to the bill that would extend the substantial disruptionwaiver provision of Section 212 of the migration and Nationality Act toDecember 31, 1964.

As financial conditions worsen. salaries in those hospitalscannot keep pees. sad the ability of the institutions to maintain the equipmentand support services required by physicians in specialty practices becosesseverely limited. The inability of thew hospitals to retain physicians inspecialty practice hinders their ability to provide services to patients whoneed them. The ANA also urges the inclusion le 5.799 of provision which would extend thelength of time fNC may spend in the United States for training from the ex-isting two years to seven years. The proposed change would recognise that masypostgraduate programs require morn than two years to complete.

DODD April 28, 1981 The Honorable Orrin BatchChairmanCommittee on Labor and Human ResourcesUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510Dear Chairman Hatch:Sw I am writing to express the views of the American Dental Associationon legislation (S.799) to amend and extend the Health ProfessionsEducational Assistance Act (P.L. 94-484). Last year the Associationsubmitted a detailed record statement on this important issue. Ourcomments in this letter are intended to emphasize certain aspectsof federal health manpower assistance with which the Association hasa particular concern. We respectfully request that these recommen-dations be included within the hearing record.Institutional SupportStudies conducted by government and private entities over the lastseveral years have shown that the collective capacity of the nation'sdental schools is sufficient to meet and exceed the current andprojected demand for dental services. The Association is in accordwith these findings and therefore reiterates the position taken manytimes in the past that the government's support of the country'sdental schools should not be linked to a formula that has alreadyburdened the system by requiring or encouraging the admission ofadditional students. A recognition that this country has achieved an adequate supply ofhealth care practitioners does not, however, relieve Congress andthe Executive of the obligation to continue supporting the enterprisewhich they have promoted and encouraged. Continuity and predict-ability of revenue is as Important to the health education systemas it is for any large and complex activity. Dental education inparticular rests upon an extremely fragile economic base. Between1970 and 1980 the average annual cost to train a dental student in-creased by over 120 percent. The current educational costs to acliental school exceeds 524,C.10 yearly - a level which iz one of thehighest among the health profession. 454 449 The Honorable Orrin BatchApril 28, 1981Page 2 Schools of dentistry are presently receiving over $12 million in annual capitation grant support. Because of the inability of manyschools to generate replacement funds, the American Dental Associa- tion urges the Subcommittee to give serious consideration to theestablishment of an alternate mechanism for providing institutionalassistance.Such a funding authority should not, as stated earlier,be linked to a student enrollment formula. Rather it should bestructured to ensure an adequate and stable level of federal support calculated as a percentage of a school's instructional budget or non- federal expenditures. Previous studies by the Institute of Medicineof the National Academy of Sciences include specific recommendations on such an approach. Student AssistanceThe American Dental Association believes that a comprehensive and financially viable program of health professions student aid should be accorded a top priority in any renewal of the health manpower law. Our position on this issue is prompted by a concern that a prospectivewithdrawal of federal institutional support will force many dental schools to raise tuition to unacceptably high levels. The conse-quence of this action is already evident in the precipitous declinein dental school applications which has occurred since 1974.Between the academic years 1973-74 and 1979-80, the average tuition rate at all dental schools increased by 126. During the same period thenumber of individuals applying to dental school's fell by 26 percent. The most recent data available to the Association indicates that a sizeable majority of the more than 22,000 dental students require financial assistance to complete their education. It is reasonable to assume that the absolute number of students seeking aid, as well as the level of assistance required, will grow in proportion to the additional increases in tuition which can be expected to occur in the next few years.It is important, we believe, that a student assistance program be responsive to the needs of the participant while in school rather than on a perception of income in later professional life. TheAmerican Dental Association supports the provisions of 5.799 whichwould permit health professions schools to continue, for three years,direct student loans from those sums which are and become available from their respective revolving funds. Unfortunately, the bill doesnot authorize additional federal contributions to the school loanaccounts.We respecL:ully disaaree that the sums which are repaidtc tta rev-'-'ng funds will be sufficient to meet the financial needsof our dental students. The Association therefore strongly recommendsthat Section 742 of the existing law be retained with an annual authori- zation of $25 million. 455 450 The Honorable Orrin HatchApril 28, 1981Page 3 The bill, 5.799, proposes a 'graduated repayment plan option\" forstudents who borrow under the federally insured loan program (HEAL).Although this provision will provide a measure of financial reliefwhile a student is in training, the ultimate level of indebtednessmay well become unmanageable as a consequence of a continuing accrualof interest. This concern underscores the urgent need to provide someform of interest subsidy under the HEAL authority. A provision ofthis nature must be considered by the Committee if federally insuredloans are to become a viable mechanism for student aid during periodsof high interest rates.The number of exceptional financial need scholarships which have beenavailable to dental students under the current law has admittedly beenall too few.Nonetheless, those dental students who did receive thisassistance during the 1980-81 academic would undoubtedly have beenunable to pursue a dental career without such scholarships. TheAmerican Dental Association urges a continuation of this authority(Section 758) with amendments allowing exceptional financial needscholarships to be available for all four years of a recipient'straining.Dental General Practice ResidenciesThe American Dental Association is most concerned over the proposedelimination, in 5.799, of support for dental General Practice Resi-dencies as authorized in Section 786 of current law. These programshaye been particularly effective in providing the future generalpractitioners with the skills and experiences necessary for theprovision of comprehensive, primary dental care. The number ofgeneral dentistry residency positions is limited, even with federalassistance.A withdrawal of this support would certainly precludethe development of any new residency programs and would likely jeo-pardize those which do exist. Given the stated emphasis on \"stimu-lating training in primary care\", we fall to understand the basis forthe sponsors of S.799 to recommend a repeal of the one program whichis designed to prevent overspecialization in dentistry. The ADAaccordingly urges that that Section 165 of 5.799 be amended to, (1)authorize a continuation of dental General Practice Residency support,and(2) earmark not less thatn 10 percent of the total sums authorizedunder Subsection (b) for this purpose.Enrollment CommitmentsThe American Dental Ass--\"\"-: \"clly endorses the provisions ofSection 122 of the bill which would direct the Department to 456' 451 The Honorable Orrin HatchApril 28, 1981Page 4 unilaterally release schools which have received construction grantassistance from all contractual enrollment commitments entered intounder that authority. As we understand this, and other Sections ofthe bill, dental schools would then be free to establish enrollmentlevels which are compatible with their educational resources.Sincerely, Wilfred A. Springer, D.D.S.ChairmanCouncil on Legislation WAS/pi 452 STATEMENT OF THEASSOCIATION OF SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES OF OPTOMETRYAND THEAMERICAN OPTOMETRIC ASSOCIATIONONHEALTH CORPS(S. 801)TO THECOMMITTEE ON LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCESUNITED STATES SENATE Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry1730 M Street, N.W., Suite 833-9890 458April 9, 1981 453 The Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry and theAmerican Optometric Association appreciate the opportunity to submitcomments on the proposed legislation S. 799 and S. 801 under considera-tion by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. We represent thesixteen schools of optometry in the United States and the 20,000practicing optometrists which are vitally interested in the role theFederal Government has and will play in health professions education.We have reviewed S. 799 and S. 801 and wish to comment on theprovisions as well as to suggost amendments necessary for ensuringthe American people an adequate supply of optometrists as well asquality vision care servcie in the future.Over the last two decades the Congress has demonstrated its concernfor education in the health professions by passage of significant legis-lation which has increased the numbers of optometric graduates, providededucational access for the less affluent and effectively upgraded thequality of education. Great strides have been made and the Congresscan be justly proud of its contributions.In many ways S. 799 represents a sudden and unwarranted retreatfrom this success which, if allowed to stand, will reverse the trendtoward adequacy and quality. Recent studies, testimony before this andother committees, and a general public attitude suggests that unless weimmediately cease all Federal support there will be a large anddetrimental excess of health professionals in our country. Further,that the \"excessive\" income levels of health professionals justify thatthey go into significant debt to gain their education. These state-ments may possibly be true for some health professions but it is our 4 454 -2- opinion that they are being erroneously translated to apply to all.An excess of orthopedic surgeons should not control the educationof podiatrists, nor should the existence of too many ophthalmologistsjustify that they perform optometric functions. Other studies showthat shortages remain and will continue in many of the non - medicalhealth professions. In optometry 50% of the present 20,000 practitionerswill leave active practice in the next 15 years due to retirement anddeath.Our schools will be hard pressed to replace this loss, let aloneaddress the unmet needs and increasing need due to population and theincreased demand of an aging population for vision services. Theexpected indebtedness will affect the practice circumstances of ourgraduates and result in a negative effect on what has generally beena better than average geographical distribution.As relates to income I can assure you that the non-medicalpractitioners are not, particularly in the early years of practice,commanding incomes that allow for repaying $50-$80,000 indebtednessIncurred in their education. You have been given annual incomefigures in the $50 and $60 thousand range during the first yearof practice.Those most certainly do not apply to optometry. Theaverage net income of tho first five years of practice is in the rangeof $20,000.Equally important is the fact that the economically deprivedcannot conceive of such a debt, even if it were possible to repay.Their social and cultural experiences would force them to reject such4 suggestion.We are left then with the rich and near-rich as theonly remaining group to pursue health professions. The advances inthis area over the last 20 years cannot be dealt such a blow.Let us turn now to specifics as relates to S. 799 and S. 801: 460 455 -3- A.Wealth Professions Data:We fully support the proposed changes in Sec. 708 to collectand analyze significant elements relating to health professions.A continuum of information and knowledge in this area iscritical for decision making for the future. Considering thecomplexity of the undertaking we question whether $3,000,000is an adequate funding level since at least in optometry, muchof the data is not prosently available.B.Grants and Loans for Construction of Teaching Facilities:We certainly favor continuation of this authority. There is aneed to expand the clinical teaching capacity of our schoolsand to renovate some existing facilities. The continuedemphasis on off-campus clinical education through affiliationscan be enhanced through this support.C.Student Assistance:The recommended change in Sec. 729(a) to provide a maximum of$20,000 is supported. Presently optometric students have hadminimal participation in this program. The ever-increasingcosts of education and the limitations of other loans andscholarship support indicate that there will be a rapid anddramatic increase in participation.The change in Sec. 731(a) to provide for a graduated repaymentplan addresses the need for the professional to becomeestablished.We would, however, alert the committee to thefact that the ultimate repayment with increased inte2:estresults in a higher debt. Such a provision only delays andexacerbates the inevitable. It will result in higher and higherhealth care costs - -just the opposite of what the Congress, 461 456 -4- the Administration and the people would hope for. It willalso cause undesirable practice choices both in type andgeographic site. Sec. 740 of the Health Professions StudentLoan Program is continued under this bill but would terminatethe Federal capitalization. The interest rate is, increased tothe level of 9%. We are pleased that this highly cost-effectiveprogram is to be continued but strongly recommend that theFederal capitalization be restored. Many of our schools arejust beginning to have repayments made into their funds andthe newer schools, three in number, have not yet had theopportunity to establish a program. This inequity should becorrected. D.Area Health Education Centers:The Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry hasobserved the functioning of AHEC's and fully concurs in thepurposes for which the Congress established this authority.Unfortunately, the medical leadership required by the existingauthority has not seen fit to include participation in theprogram of many of the non-medical health professions. Westrongly recommend that the authority be amended to includefurther incentives for inclusion of optometry and others. Wewould be pleased to work with the Committee on identifying suchincentives. E.Support Services in Underserved Areas:We concur in the proposals related to these authorities. F.Financial Distress:We concur in the proposals related to these authorities. 462 457 -5- G.Start-Up Assistance:Within the last two years three new schools of optometry havebeen established. They are in critical need of the supportunder the Start-Up authority and have based their class sizeand acceleration of the timing of the first class on theavailability of this program. These schools are not yetunder the Start-Up program due to administrative problems overwhich they had no control. We urge the committee to continuethis support by amending the bill for those schools establishedbut not yet receiving such support.I would like to turn briefly to S. 801 which extends andamends the National Health Service Corps Scholarship program. Theoptometric profession has supported this initiative. We recognize,as does the Administration and this Committee, that continued manage-ment as in the past would result in excessive government cost inthe face of a reducing need and an excess of physicians obligated toservice.As we have testified in the past, the management of the NHSChas consistently ignored the unmet vision care needs of the unservedpublic (other non-medical provider services have also been ignored).Nearly 400 vision care shortage areas have been designated underSec. 333(c).We urge the Committee to amend the authority to providethat the scholarship allocations be in accordance with and proportionalto the shortages as determined under Sec. 333(c) of the act. Withthe primary medical care needs now expected to be met, the resourcesshould address other equally beneficial services.By exclusion the proposed legislation terminates a number ofauthorities which exist under the present law. We would like tospeak to some of these and suggest amendments to S. 799 related to them. I 6(-1 458 -6- There has been an emphasis within our profession to attractminorities and other economically disadvantaged students. TheExceptional Financial Need Scholarship is the last remaining programto assist us in this goal. We have not yet made the progress wedesireOur efforts, however, will be further hampered if wecannot provide the needed financial assistance such potential studentsrequire.We ask that the Committee seriously consider restoringthis program and the funds necessary for effective support.Optometry like most health professions is dynamic. There is aconstant body of new knowledge, practice changes and the impact of systemchanges occuring at a rapid rate. The assimilation of these changesinto the optometric curriculum; changes in the existing curriculum,and strengthening of the faculty is critical to the continued qualityof our product--the graduate optometrist. The development ofeducational administrators is also a need. We have maintained somelevel of timeliness in this regard through the support of the Federalprogram under Sec. 788(c) and (d). We note that while the authorityhas not been repealed, no funds for continuation of such curriculumand faculty projects grants are provided. We recommend that appropri-ation authorizations be included to restore these grants and contractsto assist in maintaining the present quality of health professionseducation.Institutional assistance is of great importance to our institutions.It was expected that while the Congress would ultimately terminatethis direct support program a phasing-out would be provided. Ourinstitutions have worked toward adjusting to this circumstance. Theeconomic situation within the states negates the potential thatstate appropriations would be increased. At present the precipitous 464 459 -7- terminations will work a very serious hardship on our schools.At the least it will require significant tuition increases but will mostlikely result ultimately in reduced class size and a furtherShortage in the late '80's and '90's. We urge the Committee to fullyconsider the long-term impact of what appears to be a short-term dollar saving.We remain available to work with the Committee and its staff on these and other issues of common interest. 4 65 83-520 0-81---30 460211gosonation of Protnart Stfooistant i3rogranics12341 JEFFERSON DAVIS HIGHWAY, SUITE 700ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA 22202703/920-5732DONALOWRINIRMOmonmssmcnm April 7. 1981 The Honorable Orrin HatchChairmanSenate Committee on labor and Human ResourcesUnited States Senate6 237 Dlrksen Senate Office BuildingWashington.

The need for physician assistant educa-tion was addressed by the Administration and Congress in 1971 withthe passage of the Comprehensive Health Manpower Training Act and continued support was demonstrated by the passage of the HealthProfessions Educational Assistance Act of 1976. Over 75% of theprofession fostered by this federal support is providing vitalprimary care to the American public. In addition, physician assis-tants locate in rural and low income areas at a rate twice that ofphysicians. The most important factor in physician assistant educationand deployment is the potential it represents to the government inreducing health care costs. Physicians are far more expensive totrain than PAs; the total differential between training a physicianand a PA is 5110,000. In addition, physician assistants are far 4 6 462 U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human ResourcesApril 8, 1981Page 2 less expensive to employ (average salary $17,611 in 1978) and yetresearch results show the majority (up to 7S%) of adult and pediatricambulatory visits for common problems and preventive care can Desafely delegated to a PA. Most importantly the study entitled 'Surveyand Evaluation of the Physician Extender Reimbursement Experiment,*funded by the Social Security Administration, concluded that PA-assistedpractices provided more visits per $1,000 of practice cost, at ahigher quality of care, and with less charge to the patient or thirdparty payor than do traditional physician practices. Educating PAsto function in appropriate settings -- and yet function dependentlyunder physician supervision -- will assist the federal government inmeeting its cbjective of decreasing costs bile maintaining thedelivery of quality care. These facts are in part responsible for the favorable recommenda-tions made to Congress regarding PA education and reimbursement. TheGraduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee recommendedthe continued production of PAs at current levels while concurrentlycalling for a decrease in the number of physicians trained in certainspecialties.The rationale for this recommendation is based upon thefact that by 1990 PAs can potentially provide 294.7 million patientvisits and the committee concluded that non-physician providers, under the supervision of physicians, can provide these services atdecreased costs while at the same time providing a broader range ofservices. 463 U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human ResourcesApril 8, 1981Page 3 The Institute of Medicine study entitled, \"A Manpower Policyfor Primary Health Care,\" concluded that PA training should remainat the current level and should continue to receive direct federalsupport because PAs are among the most feasible practitioners provi-ding primary care to underserved populations. Congress and the Administration face an unfortunate dilemma:meeting the immediate need to limit federal spending and curb infla-tion while/at the same time continuing to support program which cansignificantly reduce national health care costs. The proposedAdministration budget figure for FY 81 of $8.1 million and the elimi-nation of funds for physician assistant educational program supportin FY 82-84 will lead to physician assistant program closures. The Association of Physician Assistant Programs recognizesthe need for its member institutions to be active participants in thc effort to reduce federal expenditures. The Association ofPhysician Assistant Programs makes the following recommendation tothe Congress and the Administration for consideration. RecommendationThe FY 81 budget figure for physician assistant educational program support be established at $8.8 million and that funding for physicianassistant educational programs be continued in future health manpowerlegislation at $8.1 million for the fiscal year ending September, 1982and each of the next two fiscal years. 46 () 464 U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human ResourcesApril 8, 1981Page 4 SUMMARY The Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committeerecommended the continued production of PAs at current levels and theInstitute of Medicine study (*A Manpower Policy for Primary HealthCare') recommended that educational programs for physician assistantsshould continue to receive direct federal support. Physician assistantshave improved access to care and have been shown to be effective indecreasing the cost of health care delivery.The above recommendations will allow for the continued educationof PAs while affording programs the necessary transition time to obtainnon-federal support for their educational endeavors. The attached paper entitled *Statement of the Association ofPhysician Assistant Programs on Physician Assistant Education and ProposedHealth Manpower Legislation* provides additional information and appropriatereferences which further document the need for continued federal support for physician assistant education.This statement was prepared and approved by the Board of Directors ofthe Association of Physician Assistant Programs. 4 7o 465 STATEMENT BY THE ASSOCIATION OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTAZ PROGRAMSON PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT EDUCATIOK ANDPROPOSED HEALTH MANPOWER LEGISLATION INTRODUCTICWThe Association of Physician Assistant Programs (APAP) represents overfifty training programs for physician assistants (PAs). Since its foundingin 1972, the Association has been providing information about the PA profession,developing and evaluating educational curricula, assisting in the developmentof a role delineation for the PA, developing continuing education programs,and conducting research on the PA profession. These research results havebeen made readily available to the Public, Congress, foundations, and institu-tions of higher learning.The Association's member programs graduate approximately 1,500 PAs annuallyfrom programs based in twenty-eight states. To date over 10,000 graduates havebeen produced. APAP programs carry various titles such as physician assistant,surgeon assistant, MEDEX, physician associate, child health associate, andfamily nurse practitioner, yet, each is involved in educational activitieswhich train assistants to the primary care physician.The purpose of this document is to present our rationale for proposedfuture support for physician assistant training programs. The report isdivided into two (2) sections. The first section describes the evolvingnature cf today's health problems and the impact of physician assistantsin the delivery of care in this evolving system. The impact is describedIn terms of economics of care, access to care, and quality of care. Thesecond section offers specific recommendations on future funding of physicianassistant training. SECTION I:EVOLVING NATURE AND IMPACT OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS A host of statistics dc,cument that Americans are living longer and arehealthier today than ever before. The dramatic decline in mortality frominfectious disease since 1900, particularly in infancy and childhood, hasbeen accompanied by a significant increase in life expectancy at birth.!While medicine and public health measures contributed significantlyto these improvements in the health status of U.S. citizens, the degreeof impact during the past 20 years has been much less than in the preceding20 years.The age-adjusted mortality rate decline has slowed to less thanone percent per year. Since the 1950s, life expectancy for adults hasincreased by only a small margin. The major health problems of todayare the result of multiple factors and have only recently been consideredamenable to prevention. 471 466 Association of Physician Assistant ProgramsStatement on ?A Education and Proposed Aealth Manpower LegislationOctober, 1980Page 2 Chronic illnesses, including those associated with aging, are theprimary causes of disability and death in middle age and liter life. Thelongevity rtsalting from medical advances creates a situation .nere chronicdiseases now affect many more persons for longer periods of time than waspreviously the case. This situation often imposes extended burdens on thepatient, families, and on society as well.Physicians are not well distributed by geographic region or specialtyto deal with these pressing health problems. It is imperative that theCongress of the 'nited States enact legislation that places greater emphasison health promotion and protection as well as to adequately address themaldistribution and over-specialization of our health care providers. Suchlegislation must carefully consider the teat to the American people. ThePotential for modifying the existing system of health care delivery focusingon these issues exists today. PAs can do much to meet the challenge ofimproving health status in the United States. As the nature of thedelivery system changes, action snould be taken to insure the important,cost-effective role of the physician assistant. The Physician AssistantThe PA profession has experienced a rapid rate of growth since thefirst program began in 1965. :n 1967, the National Advisory Commissionon Health Manpower reported, \"The development of health personnel at theintermediate professional level has been repeatedly exploredrecommend tnat tne federal government give high priority to the supportander univers!ty direction of programs which train and utilize new cate-gories of healtn professional.'3 By the early 1970's the National Centerfor Health Services Research and Development funded pilot programs forMEDEX and physician assistants. In 1970, the American Medical Association (AMA)defined the PA as \"... a skilled person qualified by academic and practicaltraining to provide patient sereices ender the supervision and direction ofa licensed physician who is responsible for the performance of tnat assist-ant.\"4Further development of the PA profession was encouraged by Congresswith passage of the Comprehensiee Health Manpower Training Act of 1971,which provided funds for the implementation of a new PA program.Strict standards for training and certification have been developed.In1971, educational essentials for PA programs were developed by theAmerican Medical Association in collaboration with the American Academyof Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the America')Academy of PediatricS, and tne American Society of internal Medicine.4-hese organizations formed tne initial Joint Review Comm,ttee on Educa-tional Programs for Physician's Assistants later ;olned by the AmericanAcademy of Physician Assistants, :he American College of Surgeons, andtne Association of Physician Assistant Programs. The Joint Review Com-mission 1; responsible for recewing the results of on-site evaluationsof 'A programs. The Committee makes recommendations for program approvalto the Committee on All'ed ^ealth Education and Accreditation (CAHEA, whichwas formally tne Council on Medical Education, AMA). 472 467 Association of Physician Assistant ProgramsStatement on 0A Education and Proposed f,ealch Manpower LegislationOctober, 1980Page 3 In 1973, tne Iational 3oard of Medical Examiners first administered anational certifying examination, which now is administered annually undercontract from the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assist-ants (MCCPA).The Commission maintains a record of all certified PAs. Theyalso require continuing medical education for biannual reregtstratton andrecertification which is required every six years.The Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-484)authorized the continuation of federal support for PA training programs. Asa result, over 50 programs exist today and graduate approximately 1500 PAseach year.PA !meet - Access and Deployment Available data reveal a wide distribution of PAs throughout all fiftystates, with the majority practicing in primary care settings. P. Forty-five states have enacted legislation recognizing and regulating the oracticeof physician assistants.7 Scheffler surveyed post-entry level PAs and foundgraduates were practicing in non-metropolitan areas more frequently thanphysicians. 4Geographically, over one-quarter of PAs are practicing in ruralareas where 25Z of the U.S. population resides. This compares to only 13%of physicians practicing in rural settings.9 Other data show 53% of PAs incommunities of 50,000 population or less where 37% of the population resides.but only 28% of physicians practice.lu Finally, several studies have revealeda positive relltipnship between location of training programs and the locationof graduates.11. 12. Relative to the provision of care, two large surveys show that between73% and 83i of PAs are working with family practice physicians. PAs arealso providing care In public hospitals (10%) and community public healthclinics (9%).Another 16% report working in remote or satellite clinicswhere direct physician services are not always availabla.6 Approximately100 PAs currently serve in the National Health Service Corps, with manymore an the waiting list. PAs have improved patient access to care by increasing the availabilityof health care services ven their geographical distribution and diffusioninto the primary cart marketplace. Increased productivity measures alsoimprove patient access since more patients are axle to be seen. Economic Pr,4uctivity Research on DA productivity Is quite favorable. PAs do increase thevolume of office visits and can improve patient access to care by expandingthe physician's practice. Controlled studies of MEOEX graduates in dashingtonState and New England reinforce this conclu,lon with practice productivityincreases measured f-om 37: to 50%.16 A study of rural California practicesrevealed PAs were quite productive, averaging 19 patients per 9ay.70 A studyperformed for the Social Security Administration concluded that practiceswith new lealth oractitioners are 50-701, more productive by number of visits 47 2 468 Association of Physician Assistant ProgramsStatement an PA Education and Proposed Wealth Manpower ...egislationOctober. 1980Page 4 tnan controls.\" The study also found that Jtilization of a ?A allows moretime per patient visit. Hershey and 4noPo reported (1979) that when a linearprogramming model is used, 393 patients can be seen per week in a practicewith a PA and 208 patients in a practice with no PA. 4 Finally, after performingextensive research and analyzing he literature, Record has stated that newhealth practitioners make extremely valuable adjuncts to primary care physiciansand assist them in meeting a larger number of outpatient visits and that newhealth practitioners are capable of performing at high levels of productiiity.18it has been concluded through empirical research that PAs are cost-effective if properly employed in private practice.19 Record estimates acost-sai'ng of 520.000 per year per PA employed in a health maintenance organ-ization due, in part, to the salary differential between a PA and a physician.20Studies of ?As in rural primary care practice. however, demonstrate some problemscaused by a lack of Medicare reimbursement. 41 The 1977 Rural Health ClinicServices Act( ?.L. 95-210) does not entirely rectify this situation due tostringent federal standards for clinic certification regulated by the Health CareFinancing Administration. Recently, tne Institute of Medicine Primary Care Study re,:ommended equal reim-bursementor 0A and physician services under Federal programs to resolve thissignificant problem. Z4The data cited above aid other research support theconclusion that ?As are cost-effective in both th..! private and public settings. Further evidence of the economic productivity of 0As is revealed in astudy by Blaxe and Guld on 'Yid -Level Practitioners in Rural Health CareA Three 'ear Experience in Appalachia.' Their findings indicate that duringthe first three years of operation of three (3) rural Appalachia clinics,76% of the geograpnically defined popu,acion of 5,500 received services. PAsand .'Ps provided care in half of the 40,252 medical encounters and 89% oftheir contacts were managed without consultation with, or referral to, the phy-sician.They further reported that the PAs managed 36% of first year visits.51% of second year visits. and 54% of third year visits. Population surveysindicated tnat consumer satisfaction with PA services is high and that healthcare from this system is perceived as being more accesible than care fromalternative sources.Impact of 0A training and employment on costs can be measured in twoimportant, yet different, ways manpower production (training) costs andutilization (employment and care purchase) costs. Educational costs dataon PAs from tne Mtianal Center for Health Services Research show the train-ing costs to be approximately $15,100 per graduate.23 any PA programs reportan annual cost aer student of S8,000-S12,000. Obviously, PA training costsare suOstantially 'ess than physician training costs. In addition, the ?Acan provide about :40 years of service before a physician, who simultaneouslybegan his/her education. can even begin residency, 474 469 Association of Physician Assistant ProgramsStatement on PA Education and Proposed Health Manpower LegislationOctober, 1980Page 5 From the above cited research it can be concluded that PAs improveaccess to health care in areas of greatest need and that when economicfactors are considered, ?As, when utilized properly, afford considerableSavings to the health care system (public dollars).Quality of Service - Quality of CareThere are a large number of studies weigh validate the level of agape-tence of PAs.Nelson24, Pondy25, and rienry46 have shown patient acceptenceas a function of perceived quality of care to be highly favorable. Forexample, Nelson found that more than 85% of patients rated PAs as highlycompetent and professional, and 71% reported an improvement in the qualityof care.Task analysis studies find PAs performing complete history andphysical examinations, diagnosing acute and chronic disease, and providingpreventive medicine and counseling services to the patient and the familyunder the supervision of a physician. Record reports no significant dif-ferences in morbidities or outcomes of care in primary we services de-livered by PAs compared to physicians in an HMO setting.a A 1977 OHMreport concluded that *physician assistants provide at least the samequality of care as the physician with whom they were compared on the sametask.448This has been further substantiated by Sox (1917) when heconcluded that the quality of primary ambulatory care given by NPs and PAswas indistinguishable from that given by physicians.49 Most importantly,it has been stated that as a result of decreased patient Baiting time andincreased continuity of professional care, the inclusion of a PA in apractice was an excellent deterrent to the ever present threat of mal-practice.30 Concerning patient acceptance of the PA, the literature is rich withstudies reporting that PAs are well accepted by their patients.31. 32 AOHMS Physician Extender dark Group reviewed existing research on patientacceptance and found excellent consumer satisfaction with PA-rendered care.33 SECTION II.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSA review of the available research data indicates that PAs are assuminga significant role in the delivery of health care in rural/urban areas, andby doing so are improvirg patient access to care. PAs are well accepted bypatients, are productive, and have been identified as a resource which in-creases effeciency in the delivery of healtn care services. In addition,PAs are delivering high quality care. As further evidence of the vale of physician assistants in providinghealth care, the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committeemade the following recommendations to the Secretary of the Oeparmtent ofHealth and Human Services regarding tne continued use of PAs. Even in the event that there is an adequate number or surplus ofphysicians in a particular specialty, the use of nonphysicianproviders (Ws, \u00b0As or nurse-midwives) may be supported for oneor more of the following. 475 470 Association of Physician Assistant ProgramsStatement on PA Education and Proposed wealth Manpower Legislation October, 1980Page 6 1.When they increase the accessibility of services.2.When they decrease the costs or expenditures associated with health care delivtry.3.When they are the providers of choice for some consumers. 4.When the utilization of nonpnysicians increases the quality of service; i.e., services provided by a team composed ofa physician and nonphysician are superior to those which aphysician working alone could provide.35In 1978, the Institute of Medicine's report of a study entitled, \"Manpower Policy for Primary riealth Care\" recommenced: Continued support for physician assistants...is based on the Committee's belief that underserved populations, especially in rural areas, can obtain economical and quality medical care from these providers. ...the Committee recommends that training programs for ...physician assistants should continue to receive federal... support,because these practitioners are the most feasibleproviders of primary care to underserved pooulations.J2 The PA profession offers a significant opportunity-for this country to realize its primary objective in promoting a balanced supply of health professionals to meet the health care needs of the American people. Accord- ingly, tne Association of Physician Assistant Programs makes the following recommendations for the funding of PA training programs in health professions education legislation. 1Federal authorization for PA training should be maintained at current levels. This is critical to guarantee the continued production of well-trained graduates at current numoers and to increase the supply of primary care health professionals. PA programs have not yet and cannot be expected to become entirely self-supporting in the period covered by tne current Act (P.L. 94-484). Surveys conducted by the Association PA Programs (APAP), data from the Office of Special Programs (Bureau of Health Planning), and the Gen- eral Accounting Office (GAO) Report on 2A Training confirm that the cost to produce a ?A graduate is approximately 510,000 - 515,000 as compared to 5112,400 to produce a board eligible family physician.If one accepts the average production cost figure for PAS at $7,000 per year and recog- nizes that 53 programs are now in need of ongoing support, w-th an annual production of 1,500 graduates or 30 graduates per program per year, we estimate the expenditures for eligible OA programs each year to be 511.13million.Assuming 5500 per graduate in tuition revenues per year or a 476 471 Association of Physician Assistant ProgramsStatement on PA Education and Proposed Health Manpower LegislationOctober, 1980Page 7 total of S.75 million in tuition revenues, and assuming that state re-venues will cover approximately 10.; of estimated educational expenditures(S1.1 million), then $10 million in federal monies will be necessary tomeet the expected expenditures of existing PA programs each year. Ifmore graduates are to be produced, additional revenues must be provided. 2.PA students should be made eligible for all appropriate federal healthprofessions scholarships, trafneeships, and loan forgiveness Programs.Our experience indicates that students entering PA training areolder and tend to have greater financial responsibilities than studentsin medical, osteopathic, dental, and nursing schools.6. .54 It has alsobeen demonstrated that most PA students, are from a lower economicbackground than the above named students.At the p-esent time, the requirements for traineeships for PAS donot conform to those for traineeships for lips. Thus in any new healthmanpower initiative, these requirements must conform. This should in-clude but not be limited to: 1) permitting individuals who do not residein a health manpower shortage area to receive a traineeship, but providingfor special consideration for individuals who do reside in such an area,and 2) clarify the Secretary's authority to determine the service commit-ment required of each beneficiary.In addition, the provisions of the current law (P.L. 94-434) gov-erning the Health Education Assistance Loans Program should be amendedin order to make PA students, who are eligible for loans, able to receivethem. 3.PA training funos should be authorized separate from nurse practitionerfunds.firsis important to prevent needless confusion over allocation3TIFaining funds. 4.Legislative priorities for awarding Physician Assistant Training Grantsshould be as 731177s. A.Encourage deployment of graduates to designated health man-power shortage areas and other underserved areas. B.Encourage cooperation of the programs with other local pri-mary care training programs. C.Encourage cooperation with local Health Planning Agencies, orcollaboration with Area Health Education Centers.

Hudson, MO, in anarticle in the Journal of the American Medical Association, calledforan advanced medical assistant with special training, inter-mediate between that of the technician and that of the doctor, whocould not only handle many technical procedures but could also takesome degree of medical responsibility.\" HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO GET OFF THE GROUND' Four years.In 1965, Eugene A. Stead, Jr., MD, launched atDuke University the first PA program with admission of fourexmilitary corpsmen to be trained as assistants to the primarycare physician.DID THE IDEA GROW ONCE IT WAS UNDERWAY?Twelve programs were In operation by 1972. Since then, under theimpetus of the Comprehensive Health Manpower Training Act of 1971,the number of programs has risen to nearly 50 from which some 1,500PAS are graduated annually. ARE THERE ANY CONTROLS OVER THE PROGRAMS AND WHAT THEY TEACH? Yes.The programs must be accredited This began in 1972 when,under the sponsorship of the American Medical Association, a JointReview Committee was formed to inaugurate a process of accreditingprograms that was approved by the U.S. Commissioner of Educationin 1974. IS THERE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS?The Association of Physician Assistant Programs was founded in 1972to facilitate the exchange of information and to provide mutualsupport in such areas as curriculum development and continuing medicaleducation.Virtually all accredited programs are now members of theAssociation which has been instrumental in defining roles of DAsIn the health care delivery system. WHEN DID CERTIFICATION OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS FIRST BEGIN?In 1972 when the National Board of Medical Examiners began developmentof a PA certification examination - the first non-MD examination ithad ever produced. The examination was first given in 1973. Thefollowing year IS national organizations voluntarily formed theNational Commissici on Certification of Physician's Assistants whichnow determines eligibility for the examination and establishes itscriteria, and administers the examination. 1/81 4 476 ARE THERE ANY PROVISIONS FOR THE CONTINUING EDUCATION OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS? Yes.In order to maintain their membership in the American Academyof Physician Assistants. PAS must every two years meet rigid continu-ing education requirements. The Academy was organized in 1968 andis now recognized as the inclusive'organization most representativeof the physician assistant profession in the United States today.WHERE MAY I OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS'AmericanAcademyof Physician Assistants2341 Jefferson Davis Highway.

The PA is qualified to performa minimum of 70 percent of the clinical procedures carried out bygeneral practice physicians.HOW DEEPLY INVOLVED IS A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT WITH PATIENT HISTORIES?The PA interviews patients and compiles patient histories. Inso doing, he gives physical examinations as necessary and ordersor gives required diagnostic tests.WHAT DOES THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT DO WITH A COMPLETED PATIENT HISTORY?The PA analyzes it along with the physical examination results tomake a preliminary diagnosis with or without consulting with thephysician he assists. That depends on the type of case involvedand the RA's working relationship with the physician.WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS? The PA develops a treatmert plan and explains it to the patient.When appropriate, he also will confer with his supervisingphysician and other professionals before implementing treatment.WHAT TYPE OF THERAPY AND PROCEDURES DOES A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PERFORM?The PA administers medications and performs intubation and cannula-tions.Also performed are a wide range of musculoskeletal, pulmonary,ear, nose, throat, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary,obstetrical, and gynecological therapies.WHAT ABOUT SURGICAL PPOCEDURES'The PA carries out a variety of minor surgical procedures. Theyrange from administering topical and digital block anesthesiathrough caring for wounds to excising superficial skin lesions.IS A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT INVOLVED IN TREATMENT OF EMERGENCY CASES?The PA treats all types of emergency cases from severe drug reactionto cardiac arrests.

Under the supervision of a licensed physician, PAs carry out a varietyof delegated functions that permit medical staffs to focus their skillswhere they are most needed. These PA functions include conducting patienthistories and physicial examinations, carrying out general workups followingphysician diagnosis of patient problems, and assisting in rounds.ARE THERE OTHER FUNCTIONS PAS CARRY OUT? PAs also initiate orders for appropriate examinations or tests requiredto evaluate a patient's illness, counsel patients, prepare summaries ofpatient hospital and clinic care, manage medical emergencies, and assistin surgery. WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF A PA TO OTHER HOSPITAL NONPHYSICIAN PERSONNEL?Normally the directions given by a PA under the delegated authority of aphysician are carried out as though given by the physician. Deviationsfrom this procedure, however, may be present due to state laws or to aparticular hospital's general, institutional, or PA guidelines.WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICANHOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ON HOSPITAL UTILIZATION OF PAS?Both recommend PAs be utilized under the supervision of a licensed physicianand be integrated into a single medical staff governed by a single set ofbylaws.They also recommend the extent of functions, responsibilities, andprivileges be determined for each PA based on individual credentials,qualifications, and competency. IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE POSITIONS OF THE AMA AND AHA ON THE UTILIZATIONOF PAs BY HOSPITALS' The PJ4A feels a PA should be an employee of a licensed physician affiliatedwith the hospital rather than of a hospital on grounds that this systembetter assures the quality of PA services. The AHA calls only for thedesignation of a physician supervisor.WHAT DOES THE JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATION OF HOSPITALS SAY ABOUT HOSPITALUTILIZATION OF PAs? The JCAH supports the concept that PAs can 'exercise Judgment within theirareas of competence, participate directly in the management of patientsunder supervision, and write orders.' To back this, it requires hospital (over) 4 Sr, 484 medical staffs to establish rules and regulations governing the utilizationof PAS.GOES A HOSPITAL UTILIZING THE SERVICES OF A PA FACE ADDED LIABILITY?Both HEW and the AMA general counsel have stated evidence does not supporta PA increases liability. There have been no malpractice Judgments againstPAS and professional liability insurance is available both for PAS and PAemployers.WHAT IS THE EMPLOYEE STATUS OF PAS WORKING IN HOSPITALS?The PA may be an employee of the hospital supervised by a hospital-salariedstaff physician, an employee of and supervised by a hospital-salaried staffphysician, or employed and supervised by a private physician, who is amember of the hospital's attending staff, in order to render services ex-clusively for the employing physician. HOW ARE PA SERVICES GENERALLY REIMBURSED?Under existing public and private insurance plans, reimbursement for PAservices always goes to the employer whether it is a hospital or a physician. GOES MEDICARE REIMBURSE FOR PA SERVICES?Medicare policy considers the services of hospital-employed PAS as allow-able costs under Part A. Employing physicians are reimbursed under PartB when the physician is directly involved in the encounter with the patientand the services rendered are normally furnished in the physician's officeand are commonly included in the physician's bills. In both cases of suchreimbursement, the PA's activities must be under direct and immediate phy-sician supervision.DOES MEDICAID REIMBURSE FOR PA SERVICES? Policy varies from state to state. Generally, recognition is given aphysician's right to employ PAS, within legal parameters, and to bill andbe reimbursed through Medicaid in accordance with prevailing regulationsfor their services when performed under the physician's direct supervision.DO PRIVATE THIRO-PARTY CARRIERS REIMBURSE FOR PA SERVICES?Most private third-party carriers consider services rendered by hospital-employed and supervised PAS as reimbursable as part of the hospital'sgeneral service expenses. Reiabursement for the services of physician-employed PAS assumes the existence of direct physician involvement.

If theAssociation can provide any assistance to you, the members ofthe Committee or the staff, please do not hesitate to contact us.Sincerely. Harr ./W. Bruce. Jr..

Hal ChristensenDr. Thomas (inlet'Executive Committee 490 STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF DENTAL SCHOOLSSUBMITTED TOU.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCESApril 16, 1981 The American Association of Dental Schools appreciates the oppor-tunity to submit a statement for the record concerning S. 799, theHealth Professions Educational Assistance and Nurse Trainin, Act of1981, now pending before the Senate Committee on Labor and HumanResources.Before presenting our views on the health manpower bill.we will first outline some of the problems facing dental schools andtheir students and present our views about the appropriate Federalroles in addressing these problems. The most serious difficulty that dental schools and their studentsconfront is that of finding ways to cope with the rapid escalationin the costs of providing and obtaining a dental education. Forthe dental school, the cost of educating a dental student reacheda staggering average figure of over $24,000 per year in the 1979-80academic year. This yearly c.'st to the institution is certainlyone of the highest of the health professional schools. In thatsame academic year, first-year tuition and fees in public dentalschools averaged $2,371 for residents and $5,700 for nonresidents.For first-year students attending a private institution, tuitionand fees averaged $7,660 and for some the total was as high as 491 $12,000.In the current year, average tuitions have climbedanother 15 percent and they are scheduled to again increase signi-ficantly in the coming school year. It is obvious that continuedinflation is steadily worsening what has already become a serioussituation for both the institution and the student. However, it is important to note that there have been several signi-ficant developments within the dental schools that have also contri-buted to rising costs. Schools have expended large sums of moneyin order to comply with the Federal requirements that have beenprerequisites for institutional support. In addition, technicalequipment which rapidly becomes outmoded in highly utilized dentalschool clinics has required replacement and modification in orderto respond adequately to new program needs, and long overdue improve-ments have been effected in faculty-student ratios. The primary concern cf the dental schools is to maintain the qualityof their programs and remain financially viable. In a survey com-pleted early last year by the American Association of Dental Schoolsthe schools that are receiving capitation grants were asked tospecify the actions they expected to take in order to accommodate M-520 0-81--324 Q\", 492 to the reductions anticipated in capitation funding. Without Federalsupport, dental schools in general would have to obtain replacementfunds to support up to 57 percent of faculty and staff salaries.Private dental schools would have to obtain sufficient replacementfunds for almost 62 percent of their faculty and staff salaries.One school anticipated the closing of the school library. All wereconcerned that the actions they were taking would make it increasinglydifficult to recruit and retain competent clinical faculty in theyears ahead. In addition, almost three-fifths of the schools responding to thesurvey planned an immediate increase in tuition and fees to compen-sate in part for the reduction in funds. Some institutions reportedthat they would also be forced to curtail or eliminate various studentprograms, including programs aimed at the recruitment and retention ofminority students. Increases in tuition, no matter how necessary,would certainly exacerbate the serious financial problems thatalready confront the needy student who wishes to attend dentalschool.Current student assistance programs although potentiallyworkable, are underfunded and are accompanied by heavily restrictiveregulations which tend to deny assistance to many students from themiddle income group. 493 -4- The Health Educational Assistance Loan (HEAL) program that wasdesigned to assist students in these circumstances has not beenavailable at all to students in schools that have opted to foregocapitation, and those students who are able to avail themselves ofthe HEAL program find that their original indebtedness is greatlyinflated by the high interest charges for HEAL loans. To theireducational indebtedness, newly graduated dentists who wish toenter practice must immediately incur large additional debts toestablish their practices. Repayment of educational and practiceindebtedness begins during a period in their careers when theirearnings are their lowest. What this is the federal role in helping schools and students toaddress these serious difficulties? We.believe this role is two-fold:(1)the federal government should supplement other sourcesof school income thereby assuring the fiscal stability of theschools so they can provide quality education for the future dentistsof the country: and (2) the federal government should provide welldesigned and adequately funded student assistance programs, so thatall students may be assured equal access to a dental education andstudent indebtedness may be kept at a manageable level. We believeit is appropriate that the federal government assume these responsi-bilities because dental schools have demonstrated exceptional 4 Q r 494 -5- responsiveness in meeting national health manpower needs. Indeed,there are seventeen states without dental schools and these statesmust rely upon the schools located in other states for their supplyOf dentists. Without a federal supplement it will be difficult and in many casestotally impossible for schools to generate sufficient income toattain anything resembling fiscal stability. It is already apparentthat income from private and state sources cannot adequately replacethe loss of revenues that would be experienced by a severe cut orelimination of institutional support from the federal government.We believe that it is essential for the federal government toassist the schools through institutional support to minimize theirneed for tuition increases. Also, it is important for student assistance programs to be trulyresponsive to student needs. It is unrealistic and unfair toask the health professions student to bear the total burden ofeducational costs simply because of the high income potential ofa successful professional practice. It is a potential that seldomis realized until many years after graduation and, for some, noteven then. u 495 -6- Specific Comments on S. 799 follow.institutional SupportThe Association is distressed that S. 799 includes no provisionfor institutional support for health profession schools. We believethat a continuation of institutional support is absolutely essentialin maintaining fiscal stability for these institutions. At the sametime, we believe that modifications are needed in the current insti-tutional support authority. The assurances that dental schoolsmust :seed in order to receive institutional support under thecurrent authority are either obsolete or unnecessarily burdensome:They further escalate the cost of dental education and they resultin the production of ore dental graduates than are needed to meetthe demand for dental services. The preferred mechanism would beinstitutional support with no required assurances. Schools couldthen direct funds into their own particular curriculum which ordi-narily has been developed with the needs of the community andregion in mind. At minimum, any assurances Lied to institutionalsupport must be reasonable, flexible and not overly burdensome. We emphasize that these assurances must be within the context ofinstitutional support. We do not think that the objective of fiscalstability can be realized through project grant authorities, because 5 0 1 496 -7- special project grants are targeted authorities carrying a forwardcommitment for operating resources. However useful project grantsmay be in contributing to educational quality and innovation, theydo not and cannot provide the basic consistent financial assistancethat is so sorely needed by the dental schools. Student AssistanceThe Association endorses the student assistance provisions containedin S.. 799 but believes that, taken as a whole, they do not constitutean adequate program for meeting the financial needs of health profes-ions students. Although we welcome the proposed three-year post-pontment in phasing out the health professions direct student loanprogram, we were aghast to find that S. 799 contains no authoriza-tion for appropriations for federal capital contributions to theloan funds for this three-year period. At a time when growingnumbers of students not only need assistance but need more assist-ance than ever before, it seems nothing short of folly to diminishthe schools' capacity to provide financial assistance by forcingthem to rely solely on roll-over monies. We are not unmindful ofthe need for fiscal restraint, but, given the circumstances, we urgethe Committee to reinstate Section 742 of the pHS Act, providingnew authorizations for capital contributions in fiscal years 1982 02 497 -8- through 1986.We fear that the time is near when only studentsfrom wealthy families and those who can afford to heavily mortgagetheir futures will be able to obtain a dental education. The Association also believes that the elimination of the authorityfor scholarships to students of exceptional financial need is bothunfortunate and mistaken. Although EFN scholarships have beenavailable to few students, those who have received them probablycould never have embarked upon a dental career without such help.It is the only aid program targeted for those in greatest need. For most students in nced of financial assistance, there will beno alternative but to borrow under the high-cost HEAL program.Although S. 799 provides for graduated loan repayments, thisprovision, while highly desirable because it will permit youngpractitioners to repay their indebtedness in keeping with thegrowth of their practices, in the long run will mean an evenheavier load of indebtedness for the HEAL borrower. What isneeded is a program of interest subsidies covering the periodHEAL recipients are still in training as well as r reauthoriza-tion of the loan repayment feature of the current program. 498 -9- Support for General Practice ResidenciesThe Association is also concerned that S. 799 contains no authori-zation for grants in support of general practice residencies (GPRs)in dentistry.By creating new postdoctoral training positions ingeneral dentistry, the GPR program has not only been helping toavert overspecialization in dentistry but it has also enabled newgraduates to receive the additional year of clinical training thatmany educators and students deem essential preparation for thepractice of dentistry. Almost 60 percent of all graduating seniorssurveyed last year expressed a need for additional clinical experi-ence before entering dental practice, and significantly, theiroverwhelming preference was for additional training in generaldentistry rather than training in a specialty. However, withonly one GPR position available for every eight graduates, thereare far too few GPR positions to accommodate these students and,given the financial situation of the schools, there is littlepossibility that additional programs can be instituted withoutfederal assistance. The GPR program is particularly important to the dentist whowishes to practice in an area where specialists are scarce orwhere he or she must provide dental services for patients withspecial health problems. Participation in a GPR program prepares 001 499 -10- the dentist to provide a broad range of services, including thecare of geriatric patients, the medically compromised and thehandicapped.In addition, the program affords dentists anopportunity to interact with physicians, nurses and other healthprofessionals in settings that facilitate their awareness of oralhealth problems which complicate the lives of patients alreadycompromised with debilitating di We urge the Committeeto add language to Section 165 of S. 799 reauthorizing grantsfor GPR programs in dentistry and earmarking for these GPRprograms, 10 percent of the funds authorized under this section. 50 HarvardMcalSchoediol500 Deoserrers woo,* 13eqzarserrizeour330 (storm A.eare(6173S20:08OOO HatchBethUnited States Senate411 Russell Senate Office BuildingWashington, DC 20510Hospital Dear Senator Hatch:We at Beth Israel, as do many others 'crow' the country, face the imminent demiseof our primary car* residency training program, a program that already has had extra-ordinary impact on our Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Not many realise it,but fully onethird of all trainees in internal medicine at Harvard teaching hospitalstoday are in a \"octal track preparing them for careers as primary car* internists.This flies in the face of the tradition of subspecialty concentration at Harvard, andshows how successful we, with federal help, have been in getting our students andtrainees to enter careers as generalists. Of the seventeen first graduates of our Hos-pital's program, all but two are in general medical practice now, and many are workingfor the underserved. in inner city health centers and in rural settings. We have hadreal impact in trying to turn around the trend to subspecialisation and inpatientcars, and it would be terribly damaging for out ;irogram to disappear.W urge you to support training in general internal medicine ma mandated it TitleVU, section 714, of the Public Health Service Act. We oppose the cutback of 35%in such programs for FY $2 and urge that the proposed rescission of more than 30%for primary care training in FY II he defeated or diminished.The impact of this section of the Public Health Service Act on general medicine traininghas been profound nationally since its inception four years ago.95% of primary care residents choose to practice as generalists.rural and inner city communities are the preferred practice sites of thegraduates.faculty supported by this program serve as generalist role models for allmedics. residents.the proportion of all internal medicine residents choosing generalist careershas risen during the last four years from 15 to S0%. Si0 501 Page 2 The Administration's Manpower budget and legislation proposes that primary care residency training programs in internal medicine and pediatrics be continued at a reduced but stable level of funding. The proposed level funding indicates that theseprograms form an important part of the Administration's plan to improve geographicaland specialty distribution nationally and to give high priority to the implementationof coat effective clinical practice. You must recognise the disastrous consequences if funding in 1941 and 1942 is reduced in a precipitous manner:....cutoff of support for one third of all primary care residents nationallyin the middle of training.termination of community based training for primary care physicians inHome Care, Nursing Home Care and Health Centers.reversion to subspecialty dominated, in-hospital training for all medicalresidents.lower quality of care for ambulatcry patients in our and other participatinghospitals.!urge you to help restore adequate funding to the FY 81 rescission budget in order to support qualified, approved programs.

Hatch, Chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources,United States Senate. 1 503 My name is Thomas Delbanco. I am a board certified, general internist; AsaociateProfessor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School; and Chief of the Division of GeneralMedicine and Primary Care at Beth Israel Hospital, one of the Harvard teaching hos-pitals.I am also Director of the Henry J. Kaiser Fellowship Program an General Medicineat Harvard Medical School, a program which ts preparing physicians for careers asteachers and scholars an primary care and general medicine. I am a councillor ofthe Society for Research and Education in Primary Care Internal Medicine (SREPCIMIsa national organization of physicians involved an practice, research, and training ingeneral internal medicine. Three years ago I was privileged to work in the Congressas a Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow, working on the staff of Senator BobDole. When the availability of primary health services reached its low point ten yearsago, the American public seemed to wake up and notice that we were preparing toomany subspecialists and too few general physicians. The doctor who used to carefor us when we were growing up had disappeared, and he was being replaced by doctorswith skills in sharply circumscribed areas. We noticed also that medical care wasgetting very expensive. Medical technology was loding and proliferating. A newtest was invented every week. Physicians were using more and more gadgets andcharging a lot for their use. What excites me about the proposed legislation is that it addresses two issueshead on: the imbaiarsco between generalists and specialists, and the mounting costsof health care. The impt.lse Lehind training programs in primary care is to Stimu-late us to turn out more general physxians and, by implication, fewer subspecialists. 5 0 D 504 Page 2 It is my sense that if we do that, we may have a real chance to improve health careand at the same time keep down same of the costs that frighten us all today. What have the training programs in family medicine, general internal medicine,and pediatrics done so far? Stimulated first by private philanthropy and then by theHealth Professions Educational Assistance Act (94-484) in 1976, medical schools havemounted exciting programs which have attracted more and more young physiciansinto primary care.If I had told my colleagues at Harvard five years ago that in 1981,30 percent of trainees in Harvard internal medicine programs would choose specialprograms preparing them for careers in primary care, they would have thought I washallucinating. But that is the case today, and the legislation should help maintainth momentum and help us more further ahead. Last year, 293 programs were supportedby the government, and it is extraordinary to watch how primary care has taken animportant role in even some of our most conservative health science centers. In addition to giving further support for the teaching programs that are nowunderway, the proposed legislation moves into a new area. You propose to fund programsto train future faculty for careers in family medicine, general internal medicine,and pediatrics.I am presently directing such a program in the Division of PrimaryCare and Family Medicine at Harvard with the support of the Henry J. Kaiser FamilyFoundation. hi recent years, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and more recentlythe Kaiser Foundation have helped establish several programs for preparing such faculty.We need federal support.1 cannot overstate the importance of the faculty role modelin the academic health science center. There are few of us in medicine who cannotpoint to one or two individuals who had a remarkable influence on our subsequentcareers.I believe that one of the principal reasons it has been difficult to get ouryoung doctors to enter primary care is the fact that these role models have pat not 5 i 0 505 Page 3 existed at the medical school in recent times. Slowly but surely the academicallyaccompliabod young generalist is emerging. We have to train more of them, and Isuspect that the money you spend in this area will have an enormous payoff for oursociety. It will have a ripple effect In terms of attracting the young physician Intoprimary care that will far exceed its initial cost. Primary care training programs help our nation address expli, tly some of theeconomic forces that play such an important role in health care. The incentive systemin health today rewards the wrong things. How can I make the most money? I canorder too many laboratory tests; I car put too many people in the hospital; I can certainlymake sure that I not give can to the poor and underserved. This has important implica-tions for primary care training programs. Why? Because in large part they are locatedat the academic health science center - and more specifically in the outpatient clinic.And at the hospital, the incentives are just as confused. Let me give an example of what I mean. If I run a hospital, and the professorof urology comes to me and says be would like to hire a few more residents to trainmore urologists, I am delighted, because I can make a pretty safe bet that over timeI shall fill more hospital beds and keep the operating room a little buster. On theother hand, If the primary can professor comes and says he would like to train moregeneralists and care for more patients in the outpatient department, and by the waydo his best to keep the patients he is serving out of the hospital, I might not be sothrilled. In particular, I may be very worried because the house officer caring forpatients who can still walk and talk can often not charge a physician's fee which third-party payers will honor. 5 506 Page 4 There w yet another problem. It is an extraordinary fact that today almostone out of every four visits to a doctor is to a hospital outpatient depart ment. Hospitalclinics have been an abomination in the past. They were the last place you wouldchoose to go for ongoing medical care if you had any choice. But training programswhich hope to produce good primary care doctors use primarily the outpatient depart-ments, and they learn very quickly that you cannot attract the young into careersin primary care if you try to seduce them in a setting where patients do not receiveexcellent care. We can see already that these training programs have been crucialfor improving the care the clinic gives. Moreover, the academic health science centeroften serves the inner city, or is the focal point for widespread rural populations.The most successful programs are integrating care in one setting for both the under-privileged and the more fortunate. We all know that separate but equal has neverworked very well in our country. This is just as true in medical care as in the publicschools on which we have focused. What happens when training programs in primary care mature? In these settingswe very rapidly become the patient's advocate. We keep our patients Out of thoseexpensive hospital beds, not pat because we are cost conscious, but because we havelearned chat the best medical care need not be centered on the hospital wards. Ourstudents learn quickly that patients, and particularly the elderly, sometimes fall apartin the hospital bed. Frequently the biggest favor we can do our patients is to managethem as outpatients.It does not make sense to teach doctors the way I was taught.I thought that good medical care meant hospitalizing a sick patient. I have learnedby now that good medical care more often than not means keeping the patient outof the hospital. That is what we teach our students in the programs the Governmenthas supported. 51 2 507 Page 5 In these programs we do not profit from the laboratory tests we order. We spenda lot of time teaching our students to think critically about the cost implicationsof their practices. Do they really need to order that expensive x-ray right now, orcan they perhaps afford to wait awhile and see what happens to abdominal pain overtime? In out primary care programs we teach our doctors what not to order; on thewards the traditional trainee sometimes orders everything in the world to see if some-thing will turn tin. I strongly support this legislation and urge you to consider raising the authoriz-ation levels for the primary care training programs. Please realize that programssuch as these form an important part of the Administration's plan to Improve geographi-cal and specialty distribution nationally and to give high priority to the implementationof coat effective clinical practice. Budgeted funds must be adequate in FY 82 toenable the Administration's and the program's goals to be accomplished, namely -tocontinue the training of physicians who will devote themselves to the practice ofprimary can in communities across the nation. 51_,,83-520 0-81--33 508 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGESOF PODIATRIC MEDICINE Mebac.. 01.00,20 CHEW CHASE CIRCLE, N W, WASHINGTON, D C 20015 202-557-4950 April 15, 1981 Orrin Hatch, ChairmanCommittee on Labor i HumanResourcesUnited States Senate4228 Dirksen Senate Office Bldg.Washington, D.

CaneExecutive DirectorRAC/cjbEnclosure 509 STATEMENT OFTHE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGESOF PODIATRIC MEDICINE ON S.799 THE HEALTH PROFESSIONSEDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND NURSETRAINING ACT OF 1981 APRIL 14, 1981 515 510 INTRODUCTION The American Association of Colleges of Podiatric Medicinerepresents the five colleges which educate this nation's doctorsof podiatric medicine. We respectfully submit this statement inregard to 5.799, the Health Professions Educational Assistance andNurse Training Amendments of 1981, and request that it be made apart of the permanent hearing record.The challenges facing podiatric medicine in the 1980's willbe unique among the health professions. Unlike our colleagues inthe other major health disciplines, podiatry is a profession that remainscritically undermannea. Additionally, podiatry remains the mostseriously maldistributed of all the health professions. Both ofthese facts have been frequently reiterated time and time again instudies conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services.The September 1980 \"Report to the President and Congress on the Statusof Health Professions Personnel\" is the most recent confirmation ofthese points.In overall terms, this Association finds the authorizationlevels contained in 5.799 for podiatric medical educaticn programs tobe inadequate to assure the nation an appropriate supply of foothealth care professionals. INSTITUTIONAL ASSISTANCE With the impetus of past federal aid, the five colleges ofpodiatric medicine have dramatically increased enrollments since themid-1960's.In 1966, there were 700 podiatric medical studentsenrolled; today there are over 2,500. In 1966, the colleges awardeddegrees to 135 individuals and in 1980 to 577 individuals. Additionally, each college now has a newly constructed orcompletely renovated physical plant.Despite this success, much remains to be done. The Departmentof Health and Human Services has identified a need to double by1990 the number of practicing podiatrists in this country and hasprojected a 30% shortfall of this goal at current graduation rates.with each of our schools currently educating maximum numbersof podiatrists, there is no chance of eliminating this shortfall 511 without a federal commitment to counter this adverse trend. Remote Site Training We propose that the Committee institute a special projectauthority within the Health Professions Educational Assistance Actdesigned to alleviate both the shortage and maldistributionproblems in podiatry through regional efforts by the colleges ofpodiatric medicine. Under the proposal we envision, our collegeswould receive Federal funds to institute an intensive effort torecruit students from underserved areas across the country. Inaddition, the colleges would guarantee that each such student wouldreceive the equivalent of at least ore and one-half years of clinicaltraining in an underserved area.We believe that this type of special project would have animmediate and positive impact on both the shortage and maldistributionproblems in podiatry. The program would provide our colleges withunique and needed incentives and resources for increasing enrollment.Further, by focusing recruitment and clinical training efforts inpodiatric underserved areas, (of which DHHS has identified 1,400nationwide) we would be more certain of attracting significant numbersof students with an orientation toward eventual practice in such areas. Financial Distress Grants We note the limited support for Financial Distress Grants inS.799.It seems likely that the contemplated cut of capitationgrants to health professions schools might, at least temporarily,heighten the need for financial distress grants, and we suggest thata precipitous cut in authorization levels for that program would beuntimely at present. STUDENT ASSISTANCE Student assistance programs are critically important to studentsof podiatric medicine. At the present time, our students pay a farlarger share of the total cost of their education that do students ofany other health profession. Half of the $14,000 annual cost ofpodiatric medical education is borne by the student in the form of 51; 512 tuition and fees.Cessation of federal capital contributions to the health pro-fessions Student Loan program will, if enacted, reduce availablestudent loans an estimated fifteen percent per ciwita fn our colleges.Many students, especially minorities and the economically deprived,would be placed at a distinct disadvantage by such a reduction inavailable funds.We are distressed to note the lack of support in 5.799 for theNational Health Service Corps and its scholarship program. Studentsof podiatric medicine have only recently begun participating in theNHSC scholarship program. With proper recruitment and orientationof recipients, we are convinced that this program can be successfulin assuring the availability of quality foot health care in thenation's many underserved areas. We urge continuation of the NHSCscholarship program wi_h an appropriate earmarking of support forpodiatric medical students. NATIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION Many of the concerns expressed Li this statement were recentlyvoiced by the National Advisory Council on Health Professions Education.In a unanimous resolution, a copy of which is submitted for the hear-ing record, the Council pointed out the critical manpower shortagesin podiatric medicine. The Council urged that the federal governmentprovide full professional and resource support to podiatry in itsefforts to increase the supply of doctors of podiatric medicine. CONCLUSION In introducing 5.799, Senator Hatch expressed his view that thebill acl,,resses the nation's most critical needs for health care pro-fessionals.Yet, the national shortage of podiatrists, consistentlyrecognized by the federal government, is never addressed by the pro-posal.We urge The Chairman and the members of the Committee to actto correct this unfortunate omission. As always, we stand ready tocooperate fully with the members and their staffs in the developmentof this important legislation. 513 Resolution on Podiatric Medical Education(adopted by the National Advisory Councilon Health Professions Education 1/29/80) WHEREAS, The Bureau of Health Manpower's 1978 Report to thePresident and Congress on the Status of Health ProfessionsEducation points out that the number of podiatrists in thiscountry are currently inadequate to meet national healthcare needs, andWHEREAS, because podiatry is moving toward an expandedfunction role in the areas of health promotion and diseaseprevention,the future needs for podiatrists take on anadded dimension of concern, andWHEREAS, statistical data contained in the above-mentionedBureau of Health Manpower report projects a need for 24,000footcare practitioners by 1990 while less than 9,000 arenow available, andWHEREAS, the five schools of podiatric medicine are nowoperating at full capacity and certain regions of the countryincluding the South have no schools of podiatric medicine, andWHEREAS,geographic maldistribution of podiatrists is moreacute than in any other health profession,THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Bureau of Health Manpowerand its parent agency, the Health Resources Administrationare urged to provide full professional end resource supportto podiatry in its efforts to increase the number of graduates;to continue the provision of incentives to assure the mat-riculation of additional numbers of currently underrepresentedpopulation groups; continue the provision of incentives,especially by means of the National Health Service Corpsscholarship program, to assure the placement of podiatristsin undorserved areas; to participate in the continuingassessment of the functions performed by the various membersof the health care team in a variety of urban and ruralsettings; to provide new incentives to stimulate the integrationof new podiatric medical oducatio- programs into existingmedical and encouragingparticipation of podiatrists in Area Health Education Centersand other continuing education programs; to continue to providesupport to existing schools of podiatric medicine with a viewtoward educating greater numbers of podiatrists; and to provideregular reports to the Council, the Surgeon General, and theCongress regarding progress in reaching those importantpodiatric manpower goals. 51 gr.) 514 April 14, 1951REGIONALDENTALEDUCATIONPROJECT Ns. site didactic and clinical health professions education and S. 799. Dear Ms. Turner: Thank you for meeting with Drs. Canfield, Rowell. and me on April 27th during ourrecant visit to Washington, and for discussing the Regional Dental Education Program(MEP) being developed cooperatively between the School of Dentistry here at the Uni-versity of Washington and the University of Utah and the Idaho State University.I em writing this letter to submit a statement to be included in the record of hear-ings held by the labor and Human Aesources Committee on April 8. 1981. 1 understandterials may be submitted for inclusion in the record of hearing within a ten-dayperiod following the actual date of hearing.

Debra Turner -2- April 14. 1981 0 - efficient and cost effective utilization of higher educationresources in preparing health professionals. These experiences have been and are taking place in connection with the remote sitedidactic and clinical education programs known as WAN! (Washington. Alaska, Montana.and Idaho) in the School of Medicine and as ROEP (the Reiional Dental EducationProgram between Washington. Utah. and Idaho) in the School of Dentistry. In eacn ofThese programs, students are admitted from their participating home state to thehealth professions school here at the University of Washington according to reouire-ments meeting accreditation. Admitted students then take the first year of theirpreparation in a home state university which is identified as satellite to thehealth professions school at the University of Washington. During the second, third.and part of their fourth years. these students then transfer to the University ofWashington. Seattle campus. entre they receive training in full mix with studentsoriginally admitted to the central university.During the latter part of the fourth year, students originally taking the firstyear in their home state satellite university then return to their home state forclinical training in whet are titled 'Community Clinical Units.' These 'CCU's'are chosen by the University of Washington both for their capacity to provide highquality clinical training and for their location in regions and which areunderserved.While working in the 'CCU.' students are supervised by local practi-tioners - persons who are given appropriate appointments to the faculty of thecentral university by reason of their qualifications and ability to teach. Also,while in the 'CCU.' students are given opportunity to prepare for and take licens-ing examinations in their home state. The WAMI Program in the School of Medicine has been operational and funded by theparticipating states for several years It has assured applicants from stateswithout medical schools opportunity for admission to medical education. Studentstaking the sequence outlined above are returning to their home states to practiceIn primary care, family medicine, and specialties required by the home state. Stateswithout medical schools are able to maintain replacement levels of needed manpower,red they are able to do this by using their already high quality non - medical- schoolwIgher education systems to provide a portion of medical professional training,thus foregoing need to construct costly new medical education facilities. Further-more, the University of Washington School of Medicine is able to maintain the crit-icalmiss of students necessary for high quality education without pumping allof its graduates into the State of Washington, a state which is near average inthe ratio of physicians to population.The ROEP program is currently under development in the states of Utah and Idaho.A total of 27 students will have been admitted by the fall of 1981. To date, ithas established that both didactic and clinical dental education can be provided ona remote site basis. Educators in participating states evaluate the program posi-tively (i.e., students admitted to satellite programs are performing at least aswell as students admitted to the central university in Seattle). These educatorsare prepared to recommend assumption of program operating costs by their respec-tive states upon termination of the Federal Contract (HRA-232-79-0069) underwhich the program is being developed.

Debra Turner -3- April 14, 1981 As so clearly identified in the \"Report to the President and Congress on the Statusof Health Professions Personnel in the United States\" (August, 1978), the problemof practioner maldistribution remains with us even though we have sufficient sup-plies of medical and dental manpower protected through the middle 1990's. TheMANI -KIP model of remote site didactic and clinical education provides a meanswhereby the resources of health professions education are marshalled to addressthis problem. Not only with respect to maldistribution, but also with respect to the question ofadmission of citizens from states without professional schools, the WAMI-RDEP modelprovides an answer. This is an important aspect because as states with health pro-fessional schools find it appropriate to modify their admissions policies in theface of reduced manpower needs and fiscal constraints, it is most often the citizenfrom a state without medical and dental schools which finds it increasingly difficultto obtain admission, regardless of how well qualified. Furthermore, states withmedical and dental education programs are not especially interested in the out-of -state student if it means that students will probably remain or return to the statein which he /she was educated, rather than to the state from which admitted to school.With present national manpower levels in medicine and dentistry, the nation does notneed to invest in additional costly educational facilities and programs for the pre-paration of these practitioners. The WAMI-RDEP model of remote site didactic andclinical training provides an alternative by which manpower levels can be maintained,presently available higher education resources in both health sciences centers andgeneral systems of higher education used efficiently, and issues of manpower locationaddressed.

I hope the manpower legislation hasa better fate than the NIH bill you and the Secretary worked on.In reviewing the testimony of Charlie Miller, before theSenate Labor and Human Resources Committee on April 8, I notedthat the Administration supports making Health EducationAssistance Loans (HEAL) available to nursing students. We represent the Association of Nurse Anesthetists and are interestedin that proposition; particularly since the anesthetisttraineeship program is eliminated in the Administration's bill.At present, there are about 15,000 active, practicing nurse anesthetists nationwide. A study by the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare in 1976 forecast a supply need of 22,000to 25,000 nurse anesthetists by 1980. Therefore, according to this estimate, we presently have a supply shortage of some 7,000 to 10,000 nurse anesthetists. The number of training programshas bean dropping also from 225 only a few.years ago to 145 now.Since the'Administration and Chairman Hatch have proposedlegislative elimination of the separate authorization for nurse anesthetist traineeships, there is likely to be no authority for traineeship support.

We, therefore, welcome theAdministration's initiative to extend the HEAL program to nursingstudent:, assuming nursing students included anesthetists. TheServioeContingency Loan program in the 1980 Senate bill includednurse anesthetists.Wo would propose that Section 737 of the Public HealthService Act, containing the definition of 'eligible institution\"for purposes of student assistance, be amended to include anaccredited program for the training of nurse anesthetists\". Also,it would be useful to establish in statute or by legislativehistory that nurse anesthetist trainees are to be conclusivelydeemed \"students\" for purposes of this program.

REV/kmlCC:Dr. Dan WhitesideMs. Jo Eleanor ElliottDr. Gordon Physicians' Specialty and LocationDecisions JACK HADLEY Several chapters in this book have alluded to physicians' responsive-ness to financial incentives as an important determinant of the ultimateimpact of a number of potential financing policies: reimbursementreform, subsidized loans, obligated scholarships, and direct grants tophysicians. This Appendix will summarize some of the available evi-dence pertinent to the question of the sensitivity of physicians' careerchoices to financial incentives. Although the quantity of prior researchon physicians career choices is impressive, most of these earlier studieshave either ignored reimbursement and physicians' incomes, or reliedon indirect proxies, such as area per capita income or populationgrowth.' Unfortunately, the few studies which have attempted to 'For surveys of this literature. sce Jack Hadley. Models of Physician? Specialty andLocation Choices. Technical Paper Series N. 6. (Rockville.

Thus, inferences drawn from these stud-ies' findings can only be considered tentative at best.With these caveats in mind, we review three groups of studies:analyses of physicians' specialty chokes, analyses of geographic distri-bution as a function of average fee levels, and analyses of geographicdistribution as a function of physicians' gross or net incomes. Includedin the last set are two studies of physician distribution in Canada.These use more accura!e data on physicians' payments and net incomesthan have been available for analysis of U S. distribution. The applica-bility of this body of research is based on the underlying premise thatincreasing the reimbursement rate for a particular specialty or locationraises physicians' incomes.2Physicians' Specialty ChoicesThe area which has received the least amount of prior research is theimpact of income on physicians' specialty choices. Two studies, bySloan and Lee, were discussed in Chapters IV and V, and will not bediscussed again here) Both found that higher specialty income wasassociated with a greater number of residents in that specialty's train-ing programs. In both cases, however, the magnitude of the estimatedrelationship was small. A 10 percent increase in a specialty's incomewould increase the number of residents in that specialty by between .4 21n general, physicians' incomes could be increased in two nays increasing prices paidfor physicians services or granting lump-sum payments (bonuses) to physicians In bothcases, the increase in income may lead to a reduction in the numbers of hours worked byphysicians We ignore such effects in this review For empirical evidence on this issue. secMartin S Feldstein, \"The Rising Price of Physicians' Services.\" The Res ieu of Econom-ics and Statistics 52 (May 1970) 121-33.

A third study investigated the probability of individualphysicians entering one of nine alternative specialties.4 It found thatthe choice of internal medicine relative to general practice was posi-tively related to the ratio of internists' incomes to general practitioners'incomes. Income did not have a significant impact on choosing any ofthe other specialties. However, these estimates are likely to be biaseddownward because the measure of specialists' incomes used probablyunderstated the conceptually appropriate variable, individual physi-cians' expectations of their earnings in alternative specialties. Physicians' Fees and Geographic DistribtitionStudies by Fuchs and Kramer, Ramaswamy and Tokuhata, and Cant-well have investigated the relationship between cross-sectional varia-tions in the number of physicians per capita and some measure of theprice of physicians' services.5 Although each used a different data set,geographic unit of analysis, and definition of price, all three found thatprice had a positive and generally statistically significant effect on therelative number of physicians in the area. Fuchs and Kramer estimateda multiequation model of the physicians' services sector using 1966data for thirty-three states. Their physician supply equation related thenumber of active, patient care physicians per 100,000 population, tothe average price of a physician visit (mcasured in GP- equivalents),income per capita, hospital beds per 1,000 population, the number ofmedical schools in the state, and the average number of visits perphysician.

Elasticities (thepercentage change in physician supply for a 1 percent change in price)ranged from .419 to 1.144, with three of the six reported valuessignificantly different from zero. Although these findings are consistentwith prior expectations, the results are suspect because of the very poorquality of the underlying data.'Ramaswamy and Tokuhata estimated a model identical to Fuchs'and Kramer's, but with a very different and much more precise datafile. A :.andom sample of 658 self-employed physicians was drawn fromPennsylvania Blue Shield's claims files for 1972. Data on the samplephysicians' prices charged and quantities of services provided wereaggregated to the county level to form a cross-sectional data file withsixty observations. Average price was defined as a weighted index offees charged for specific procedures. Although their results show thesame sensitivity as the Fuchs and Kramer findings, their elasticityestimates were always positive and significantly different from zero,with values ranging from 2.47 to 6.20.These values are considerably higher than those reported by Fuchsand Kramer. However, this is due in part to an important difference inthe definition of the unit of output. The two sets of estimates can bemade comparable by assuming that the Ramaswamy and Tokuhataoutput measure, the weighted physician's service, is equivalent to 3.29GP visits, the output measure used by Fuchs and Kramer. (Theconversion factor is simply the ratio of the average prices in the twostudies, expressed in 1967 dollars.) Applying this transformation re-sults in elasticities ranging from .75 to 1.884, still larger than the Fuchsand Kramer estimates, but nevertheless remarkably similar given thedifferences in the underlying data.Cantwell used data from the American Medical Association's 1975Periodic Survey of Physicians to construct two cross-sectional datafiles consisting of 261 standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSAs)and fifty non-SMSA areas. (Non-SMSA counties within each state See Fuchs and Kramer. Determinants of Expenditures. pp. 27-29. for details on theconstruction of their variables Both the quantity of services per physician and averageprice per service had to be estimated by indirect methods 59c 523 250 Jack Hadky were aggregated to form each observation.) His dependent variablewas the number of nonfederal patient care physicians in the SMSA ornonmetropolitan area. Price was represented by the average fee for afollow-up office visit. Other variables in the equation included popula-tion, mean physician visits per capita, hospital beds, a measure ofphysicians' gross billings in equilibrium, an index of the quality of lifein the area, and the number of graduates of local medical schools in thearea. Although the choice of estimation method is subject to question,'the price variable still has the expected sign in both the SMSA andnon-SMSA equations and is statistically significant in each specifica-tion. The estimated elasticities were quite similar for both types ofgeographic areas. Their values ranged from .43 to .52 for SMSAs andfrom .43 to .55 for rural areas. Physicians' Incomes and Geographic DistributionA second approach to investigating the geographic distribution ofphysicians is to analyze the relationship between the number of physi-cians in an area and some measure of physicians' incomes.\" If the 'Both price and gross billings are probably simultal-,cously determined with the numberof physicians This implies that use of ordinary least squares regression analysis wouldresult in coefficient estimates biased toward zero.There are also three studies which investigate the probability of making a particulartype of location choice These will be only briefly mentioned here because their depen-dent variables cannot be easily translated into actual physician supply in an areaBrown found a positive, statistically significant, but quantitatively small Impact ofphysicians' earnings on the probability of choosing a nonmetropolitan practice locationin Nova Scotia.Yett and Sloan investigated the probability of a state's retaining physicians who hadhad some prior medical educational contact or were born there Their sample consistedof physicians who were in training or in the military in 1965 but in practice in 1966. Theyfound that physicians' net incomes in the state (as reported in the American MedicalAssociation's Periodic Survey) had a negative and in two cases minimally signifi-cant impact on the overall retention probabilities for both specialists and generalpractitionersFinally, Hadley investigated the probability of an individual physician practicing in aparticular state, given different combinations of prior cuntact with that state He did notfind physicians' income in the state to have a statinically significant of on any of thelocation probabilities. 52V83-520 0-81 --34 524 Reimbursement and Specialty and Location Decisions 251 number of services or units of output produced by a physician is notvery sensitive to small changes in price (reimbursement), then a changein the reimbursement rate, say a 10 percent increase, is equivalent toincreasing income by the same amount. lf, on the other hand, anincrease in reimbursement either stimulates additional production orinduces physicians to take mor- leisure time, then the change in incomewill be either larger or smaller than the change in the reimbursement.Unfortunately, evidence on this issue is ambiguous.'' Therefore, inorder to facilitate comparisons across studies, we shall assume thatphysicians' incomes can be altered by changing reimbursement rates byan. equivalent amount.Five studies, three using U.S. data and two using Canadian clOa,have investigated the impact of physicians' incomes on physiciandistribution.\") Sloan, and Harrison and Jud, investigated interstatedistribution in1960 and 1967-68, respectively), Held studied themigration behavior of physicians who graduated from medical schoolbetween 1955 and 1965)2 Hadley and Berry et al. analyzed physician For details. see Murry G.

The Berry etal. study also has two unique features. First, it examined physicians'location choices within the province of Quebec using sixty-five medicalservice areas as the geographic unit of analysis. Second, data onindividual physicians' gross billings for each of five years were madeavailable by Quebec's provincial health insurance agency.Sloan estimated two physician supply equations as part of a multi-equation model of the distribution of medical care resources.\" The twoequations' dependent variables were the number of active, nonstudentphysicians per 100,000 population and the proportion of active, non-student physicians who received their M.D. degrees between 1945 and1954. The former focuses on the physician stock and the latter onphysician flow (recent graduates). Both equations were estimated usingstate data for 1960. The physicians' mean net income variable wasconstructed from Internal Revenue Service data on the incomes ofsole-proprietorship physicians in 1960. Other variables in the equa-tions included hospital assets per capita, medical students per 100,000population, public school expenditures per pupil, the number of medi-cal students from the state per 100,000 population, a measure of thecyclical sensitivity of the state's income level, the failure rate on thephysician-licensure examination, and the proportion of physiciansworking more than forty-nine weeks.The physician stock equation was estimated in both static anddynamic forms. The latter includes a variable measuring the value ofthe dependent variable ten years earlier (1950). The dynamic specifica-tion is based on the assumption that it takes several years for thenumber of physicians in a state to fully adjust to a change in physi-cians incomes. This equation generates both short- and long-runestimates of the income elasticity of physician supply. Since physicians'income is simultaneously determined with physicians' supply in Sloan's \"Jack Hadley. \"Canadian Evidence on the Income Elasticity of Physician Supply.\"Urban Inctitute Working Paper No 1225-2 (Washington.

The long-run elasticity,however, was considerably larger, with a value of .98. This suggeststhat a 10 percent increase in physicians' mean net income in a statewould eventually result in an almost equal increase in the number ofphysicians per 100,000 population.The physician flow equation also indicated that higher physicians'incomes are associated with a greater flow of recent graduates into thestate.16 The elasticity of physicians' income in that equation was .26.Another variable associated with financial opportunities, the propor-tion of physicians working more than forty-nine weeks, also had apositive and statistically significant effect on the number of recentgraduates.Held analyzed the location behavior of recent medical schoolgraduates by focusing on the in- and out-migration rates by state for asubsample of 1955-65 graduates of U.S. medical schools. Looking onlyat physicians who did not attend medical school in the state in whichthey were practicing in 1971, he found that physicians' income (mea-sured by solo practitioners' net profit in 1966) had a positive effect onthe rate of in-migration.\" However, the estimated coefficient wasstatistically significant only for physicians who had residency trainingin the states. Tte elasticities for these physicians were .94 for generalpractitioners and .88 for specialists. For physicians who had no priorcontact in their state of eventual practice location, the elasticities wereonly 12 and .04 for general practitioners and specialists, respectively.Physicians' income had a negative, though insignificant effect in threeof four out-migration equations.The model formulated by Harrison and Jud is conceptually similarto Sloan's, but somewhat more parsimonious. They focus on only twoequations which explain physicians' earnings and the number ilac:ky nonfederal physicians per capita. Thc latter was assumed to depend onphysicians' earnings, which wcrc measured by average net earningsreported by sole-proprietorship physicians' practices to the InternalRevenue Service, the number of medical students in the state, and theproportion of the population living in metropolitan areas. State datafor two years, 1967 and 1968, were pooled to form a sample of sixty-seven observations. Using two -stage least squares regression analysisto estimate the model's parameters, they found that physicians' netincome had a positive and statistically significant effect on the numberof physicians in a state. The computed elasticity was 1.65.Hadley analyzed data on physician distribution in Canada usingdata for nine provinces over a nineteen-year period, 1958-76. Becauseof the relatively long time series available for each province, he wasable to formulate a dynamic model in which the number of active, fccpractice physicians per 1,000 population depends on physicians' meannet income from medical practice, the number of medical schoolgraduates in the province three years earlier, and the dependent variablelagged one year. Thc last variable incorporates the assumption that ittakes several years for the equilibrium stock of physicians to adjust tochanges in net income The source for the income variable was Re-venue Canada, Taxation, which had access to physicians' tax returns.Thus, the measurement of this variable is probably more accurate thanin other studies reported above. Other variables in the physicians'income equation wcrc per capita income in the province, the number ofshort-term hospital beds per 100 population, and a dummy variable forthe introduction of universal, comprehensive health insurance in eachprovince.\"Using a simultaneous eqUation method to estimate a linear supplyfunction, Hadley found physicians' net income to enter with a positiveand statistically significant coefficient with a short-run elasticity of .49.The speed -of adjustment parameter implied a full adjustment period of6.70 years. Thc long-run elasticity was 3.28.'9 These elasticities imply \"Comprehensise health insurance was implemented separately .n each pros ince beginrung with Saskatchewan in 1962 and ending with Quebec and Prince Eduard bland in1971\"Estimation of the model in logarithmic form produced estimates of 64 for ihr short-run elacticit). 3 39 )ears for the adjustment period. and 2 17 for the long run clesticit) 50 , , 528 Reimbursement and Specialty and Location Decisions 255 that a one-time increase in all physicians' net incomes in the averageprovince would cost about 570,000 (in 1976 U.S dollars) per netaddition to the physician stock in the first year. After full adjustment,however, the cost drops to about 556,000 per net addition per year.Finally. Berry et al estimated a series of equations explaining in-and out-migration rates of physicians in Quebec over the years 1971through 1975 '10 Their geographic unit of analysis was a medical servicearea, which was defined on the basis of clusters of physicians andhospitals within the province. Physicians' income in the market areawas measured by average gross payments from the Quebec insuranceagency to physicians in the previous year. They found that the netmigration rate for general practitioners was positively related to grosspayments to general practitioners in the previous year. The impliedelasticity was quite high, with a value of 3.44. They also found that newgeneral practitioners are more responsive than established generalpractitioners, with elasticities of 2.10 and 1.67 respectively. For special-ists, on the other hand, incom- was negatively and significantly relatedto the net migration rate.In interpreting these results, itis Important to emphasize thatspecialists in Quebec must be board-certified Consequently about halfof Quebec's physicians are general practitioners. This differs signifi-cantly from the United States, where medical specialty statistics arebased on self-designation Thus, a Quebec specialist is much morelikely to depend upon a relatively large population and ready access toa hospital for the conduct of his or her practice. This greater depen-dency on nonfinancial factors may help explain the unexpected resultsfound in the specialists' migration equations.What conclusions can be drawn from this review? First, the litera-ture on physicians' specialty choices and financial incenti.es is verysmall and characterized by extremely poor data Keeping this in mind,the three studies reviewed imply a small positive or insignificant effectof income on specialty choice. The literature on geographic distribu-tion is larger, with a total of eight studies reviewed In spite of consid-erable variation in data, models, and estimation methods, all of thestudies found income to have a p.itive and generally statistically \"'Berry ct al . -Responses of Canadian Physicians\" 534 529 256 Jack Hadky significant impact on the number of at least some types of physicians ina geographic area. However, the magnitude of this relationship, mea-sured by the percentage change in the number of physicians for a Ipercent change in income orprice, varied considerably, from .06 to6.20.Table A1.1 summarizes these studies and their findings. Of particu-lar interest is the estimate of the cost per new physician per year ofusing financial incentives to attract physicians into an area. Theformula used to compute this cost is based on the assumption that allphysicians in the area receive a 10 percent increase in net income andthat new physicians also receive the higher average income. In sym-bols, this can be represented by A Y A Y[(y) (DOCS) ( Y) + (I + 7-) (ADOCS) ( Y)1/ADOCS, A Ywhere ---- = percentage change incomesY = physicians' net incomesDOCS = number of physiciansEDOCS = number of new physicians attracted to area.This expression can be simplified torAn+ ( I +FY) Y, were n is the elasticity of the number of physicians with respect tophysicians' incomes. In effect, then, the cost per new physician de-pends critically on the value of r) as well as on physicians' income levelsand the proposed change in income.The last column of Table Al I shows this clearly. Annual cost pernew physician based on data from studies which estimated elasticitiesgreater than 1.0 ranged from about $56,000 to $93,000 in 1975 dollars.Cost estimates are more than two times larger, however, using theelasticities reported by Cantwell and Hadley.There is reason to believe, though, that in general these cost 535 StudyYearsAnalyzedI.

First, the Berry et al. studyindicated that new general practitioners have a higher elasticity thanany other category of physician. Second, the mean income expected by new physicians is likely to be lower than the mean income forall physicians. Third, the Berry et al. and Hadley studies spanned time periods of rapid increases in the stock ofphysicians. Thus, their estimates may be more relevant to the projectedsituation. in the United States than studies which used only singleperiod cross-sectionsand/or data from the 1960s. These observationssuggest that a policy which is implementedduring a period of expanding physician supply and which limits financial incentives for locating in particular areasto new physicians in primary care specialties might be less costly than indicated by Table A I. IPerhaps the strongest conclusion of this review is thatmore re- search with recent and goodquality data is needed. This is especially true for the question of the effect of incomes and feeson specialty choice Although the geographic distribution research is consistent with regard to its qualitativeconclusion, there is considerable variation in the exact magnitude ofthe income effect. As thecalculations in Table A1.1 suggest, the value of this parameter is key inestimating cost implications of a financialincentives policy. t:,.0 4'..1 533Appendix 2 The National Health Service Corps*t JACK HADLEY Thc National Health Service Corps (NHSC) was established by theEmergency Hcalth Personnel Act persons and arcas of the United States where hcalth personneland services arc inadequate to meet the needs of residents of suchcommunitics and areas.\"' This objective was reiterated in the HcalthProfessions Educational Assistance Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-484), whichdirected the of of purposc, thereappears to have been a fairlymajor shift in the government's perception of the role of the NHSC.Thc initial concept of the Corps was that of a facilitator which helpedlink physicians interested in practicing in underserved arcas with needy ...----1 would Tike to thank 11.chard Schulman, Terry Smegelsky, Nancy Dv., Ion, and GaryWold of the Bureau of Health Manpower for making current dzta 2,.ailable andproviding helpful comments.W S , Congress, Senate, Emergent.)

Recruitment was to be primarily voluntary, and theCorps' presence in any particular community limited to the transitionperiod needed for the physician to become reasonably established. Themajor emphasis was on bringing physicians to rural areas. The mostrecent legislation, on the other hand, projects a NHSC greatly ex-panded in size and directly tied to obligated service scholarships andloans with forgiveness options. Also tl-e Corps' future orientation islikely to be more urban and institutional In effect, the NHSC nowappears to be the primary policy instrument for direct intervention intothe physician distribution processBecause of the expanded role envisioned for the Corps and itsdirectlinkto major financing options for undergraduate medicaleducation, this Appendix will describe the NHSC and provide data onsome aspects of its performance. However, the rapid changes in theCorps' nature and size and its relative immaturity preclude a full-scaleevaluation at this time. Also, this review will concentrate on physiciansin the NHSC, even though the Corps includes several other healthprofessions.The Health Services Administration, an agency of DHEW's PublicHealth Service, administers the NHSC. This entails assigning recruitsto eligible communities and managing the day-to-day operations ofCorps sites. Another Public Health Service agency, the Health Re-sources Administration, has primary responsibility for two other activ-ities directly related to the NH SC operating the scholarship and loanprograms which are now the major vehicles for recruiting physiciansinto the Corps; and designating areas, populations, and institutionswhich have health manpower shortages and therefore are eligible tobecome Corps sites.Both the recruitment and the assignment processes are gearedtoward increasing the odds that a physician will remain to practice in ashortage arca, either as a voluntary member of the NHSC or in privatepractice Thus, preference for award of an NHSC scholarship is givento applicants who plan to enter primary care residency training, whocome ft om medically underserved urban or rural areas, have had workexperience in health manpower shortage areas, and/or express plans towork in a health manpower shortage area after completing the NHSC r--,O'i 9 535 262 Jack Hadley service obligation.3 Financial need of the applicant is not a criterion.Assignment of physicians operates primarily on a cooperative ratherthan a command basis. Each physician is permitted, at governmentexpense, one visit to a prospective site before agreeing to serve there.The Corps also assists eligible communities in developing, organizing,and managing a medical practice facility in order to make them asattractive as possible to NHSC physicians. Thus, the Corps retainssome of the spirit of its first years by continuing to serve a brokerfunction between communities and physicians.5Scholarships in exchange for NHSC service were first authorizedby the Emergency Health Personnel Act Amendments of 1972 (P.L.92-585). Each award consisted of full tuition and fees, paid directly tothe student's medical school, plus $6,750 per year paid to the studentfor living expenses. The scholarship could be renewed for up to fouryears of full-time attendance in a medical school. The service obliga-tion consisted of one year of service in the NHSC (or the Indian HealthService or Bureau of Medical Services, which are also components of:he Public Health Service) for each year of scholarship support, with aminimum requirement of two years of service. The beginning of theservice period can be deferred for up to three years for internship andresidency training.Scholarship awards were made to 4,710 medical students over thefive years (academic years 1973-74 through 1977-78) covered by P.L.92-585.6 About $110 million was obligated during this period, withabout 31 percent going to medical and osteopathic schools for tuitionand fees.

Some of this growth was due tothe increase in the average value of a NHSC scholarship, to almost$11,100 in 1977-78. However, the bigger share of the increase isattributable to the growth in the number of awards made each year.Data for 1977-78, the first year covered by the 1976 Act, illustrate thedramatic growth Intended for the NHSC. The number of awardsincreased by 32 percent and total amount awarded jumped by over 60percent.As of June 1978, 2,867 of the medical students who receivedscholarships were still in school and 1,416 in deferred status.' Morethan 80 percent of those in residency training were in the three primarycare specialties of family practice, internal medicine, and pediatrics.8Thus, almost 92 percent have yet to fulfill their service obligation Ofthe remainder, 169 are on active duty, 73 have completed their service,and 133 chose financial repayment.9 (This last figure appears to ex-clude 4 deaths and 43 students who failed to complete medical school )Although the number of students not fulfilling their service obliga-tions is small relative to the total number of students receiving scholar-ships, it represents more than 30 percent of students not still in medicalschool or graduate training. Table A2.2 breaks down monetary repay-ment cases by reason. Under the terms of the scholarship program,those who complete their degree but refuse to serve their obligation arerequired to repay the full amount paid to them and on their behalfwithin three years of default at the maximum interest rate allowed inthe District of Columbia (currently 8 percent). As noted in Chapter V,this effectively converts the scholarship into a loan. The principalamount depends on the number of years an award was made plustuition at the student's medical school. If we assume an average annualtuition of $3,000 during the period covered, then the maximum repay-ment would be $39,000 plus interest. The average monetary repay-ment, however, may be considerably smaller, which makes default anattractive optionfor physicians who facefinancially rewardingalternatives.

Table A2.3 lists the ten schools of medi-cine and osteopathy which received the largest number of awardsbetween 1973-74 and 1977-78. Two of the top three medical schoolshave predominantly nonwhite student bodies. The other six medicalschools charged relatively high tuitions, thus inreasing the value of theNHSC scholarship. In 1976-77, average tuition and fees per medicalstudent at all medical schools was $3,295.10 Excepting Howard andMeharry, tuition ranged from $4,000 to $7,000 for that year in theother medical schools listed in Table A2.3. These ten schools ac-counted for almost twenty-five percent of the total awards made. Atthe same time, thirteen schools had fewer than ten NHSC scholarshipawards over the five years. Among the apparent reasons for these lowparticipation rates are a strong nonprimary care orientation, lowtuition rates (particularly at public medical schools), and generousstate financial aid to students.The Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1976 ex-panded the scope of the NHSC in, two ways.

In addition, designation takes into accountnot only the ratio of physicians to population, but also health indica-tors such as infant and maternal mortality, access to health services,and the number of foreign medical graduates practicing in the area. Asa result, the number of designated areas has more than doubled, from1,100 in 1975 to about 2,800 in 1979.\" More importantly, this .:hang.will permit a much greater penetration of the Corps into urban areas.Second, authorized appropriations for NHSC scholarships havebeen increased dramatically. For fiscal year 1977, the last year coveredby prior legislation, $40 million was appropriated for scholarshipsupport Under the new legislation, NHSC scholarship appropriationsare increased to S60, $75, and $79.5 million for fiscal years 1978through 1980. DHEW estimates of the number of scholarshipsawarded to medical students for these years are 4,118, 9,542, and13,292 at an average annual cost per award of S11,000.12 In 1977-78,1,593 awards were made.\" Because of deferments for medical educa-tion and residency training, current awards will not have a majorimpact on actual NHSC field strength for several years.There were about 1,000 physicians assigned to NHSC sites in 1978and 1979. DHEW has estimated that if the NHSC is to be theprimary vehicle for meeting critical health manpower shortage area needs by1990, approximately 5,000 physician assignees wouldbe required each year.\" Although this represents almost a fivefoldincrease over current size, the NH SC would still absorb no more than asmall fraction of the total stock of patient care physicians in the UnitedStatesIf half of the NHSC physicians complete their obligations and \"Miike and Zuckert, Table 6\"Ibid..

Health Services and HealthResources Administrations, March 1978 541 268 Jock Hadley drop out of the program in any given year, then NHSC obligations willbe required from about 15 percent of future medical school classes inorder to maintain staffing.A third significant change incorporated into the 1976 law affects thepenalty for defaulting on a service obligation. The financial penaltywas increased to three times the amount of scholarship award plusinterest at the maximum prevailing rate (currently 13% percent). Thepayback period was also shortened from three years to one year. Sincethe average award is about S11,000 per year for two or more years, thisincreases the monetary cost of default to about $70,000 which wouldhave to be paid in one year. Although there has not been any expe7i-ence yet under the new default provisions, this would appear to be asignificantly greater deterrent than was in effect under the previouslegislation.In spite of the major role projected for the NHSC, there has beenrelatively little experience with actually operating practice sites staffedby scholarship obligees. Because of deferments for medical educationand the Corps' very modest funding in its first years, the number ofstaffed sites in operation in 1978 was 668, less than 15 percent of thetotal number of sites projected for !983. Furthermore, these sitestended to be predominantly rural and organized along the lines of atraditional fee-for-service practice with one or two physicians. Bycontrast, DHEW anticipates that in 1983 a:most 80 percent of Corpsassignees will be placed in some type of institutional setting, with about35 percent located in urban areas. Thus past data may not be veryreliable for assessing future performance of NHSC sites.With this caveat in mind, Table A2.4 reports various data on Corpssites for the years 1975 through 1978. Cost per encounter appears to berelatively comparable to fees charged by prisate practitioners in non-metropolitan counties According to an American Medics'.

However, TableA2.6 reports the findings of a study of thirty NHSC sites conducted in1975. Productivity is measured as encounters per physician or physi-cian-hour.

Again using American Medical Association data for comparison,unadjusted figures for the numbers of patient visits per physician and 1544 National Health Service Corps 271 per physician-hour in non metropolitan counties in 1975 were 7,975 and3.37.\" These arc roughly 70 and 40 percent higher than the average forNHSC sites. Limiting the private practice sample to solo, nonmetro-politan, primary care physicians between the ages of thirty and thirty-five reduces the annual patient visit figure to 6,627.'8 However, this is still about 40 percent higher than the NHSC average.A number of factors may explain these differences:natural selection of private practices into the most productiveand financially viable locationsunwillingness of local populations to give up traditional sourcesof caresalaried reimbursement of NHSC physicians, as opposed to fee-for-service reimbursement of private practicesdifferences in the style and quality of care deliveredcontinual practice-building and start-up periods, due to turn-overs in NHSC physiciansIdentifying the relative importance of these factors is critical to deter-mining the viability of the one-or-two physician practice model which has so far dominated the NHSC experience. Some of these possiblesources of low productivity may be dealt with by altering programstructure, for example, offering productivity bonuses for NHSCphysicians.If, on the other hand, the NHSC is to serve as a provider of lastresort in areas which, under current insurance and reimbursementsystems, cannot support private practices, then the apparent lowproductivity and high cost may be an inevitable component of effortsto redistribute medical care. In this regard, the NHSC would be muchlike other public programs which provide services to rural and/or poorpopulations at subsidised rates.

Data reported above indicate that Corps physi-cians' salaries were approximately $32,000 in 1975. If we ignore generalinflation and assume an average annual scholarship award of $11,000which could have accumulated interest at 8 percent for seven years(four years of medical school plus three years of residency training),this adds an additional cost of almost $19,000 to the physician's first-year salary and to each year up to the minimum required. If nophysician served in the Corps beyond the minimum, then the averageannual cost per physician would be about $51,000. To the extent thatphysicians stay in the Corps, scholarship costs can be spread over moreyears of service, thus reducing average annual cost per physician.Unfortunately, data on average tenure in the NHSC are not available.However, according to data reported in Table A2.4, the proportion ofphysicians remaining in an underserved area for at least one additionalyear has increased to almost 50 percent in 1977 and 1978, compared toonly 26 percent in1976. This will lower cost per physician-yearsomewhat.In 1975, median net incomes for physicians in nonmetropolitancounties were $48,286 for all specialties, $41,900 for and suggested that physicians' location decisions couldbe influenced directiy through manipulation of the reimbursementsystem Although calculations were necessarily crude, it was estimatedthat if physicians' location choices are relatively sensitive to financialincentives, the average annual cost per physician attracted to anunderserved area might be on the order of $60,000 to $90,000 per yearbased on.a 10 percent increase in physicians' net incomes. If adjust-ments were made for productivity differences between private andNHSC practices, then the two policy strategies appear to be roughlycomparable in cost per physician year.If there were no political constraints on policy options, then theredistribution of physicians and medical care services in general could \"Ga ffncy.

Current approaches are evaluatedusing these criteria and are shown to be unsatisfactory. An alternativemethod, based on the economic theory of production, is then described.The paper concludes with some recommendations for further research. I.IntroductionAnalysts, administrators, and legislators generally agree that the princi-pal health manpower supply issue is no longer an inadequate total supply ofpersonnel, but rather a maldistribution among activities and locations.Implicit in this assessment is the notion that there are known optimal distri-butions against which existing manpower allocations can be compared. In thecase of the geographic distribution of physicians, such a comparision mightresult in a ranking or listing of areas according to their apparent physiciandeficit or surplus. Policy-makers would then have a clear indication of whattypes of reallocations of existing physicians and/or assignments of futurephysicians would lead to a more socially desirable physician distribution.Although described very simply, this scenario underlies much recentfederal legislation and program activity. For example, the National HealthService Corps, Health Professions Loan Forgiveness, Health in Underserved RuralAreas, and the Rural Health Clinics Act in one way or another all rely upon thedesignation of certain areas as \"shortage\" lcoations in order to make their awnallocation decisions. Thus, the fiscal stakes involved in distributing federalresources are already large and could grow such larger still under schemesenvisioned by some national health insurance oroposals.This paper has three objectives. The first is to describe some charac-teristics which one might wish to incorporate into a method of determining underserviceThis in turn provides a backdrop for evaluating existing methods. 549 2 Lastly, we propose an alternative approach and outline some exploratoryresearch to investigate its feasibility. II.Some Desirable Characteristics Postponing until later the critical question of data availability,what properties would we like an ideal method of determining underservice to have?At least four come to mind: an explicit identification of the good which isin short supply, the ability to identify the source of the under-service,the ability to make cardinal comparisons acrossareas or populations, and an explicit allocation rule for addressing theunderservice.The first of the four is simultaneously the most obvious andthe most complex requirement. Although all of us probably feel that wehave a good intuitive sense of shortage or underservice, i.e., we'd knowone if we sew it, translating this notion into a formal statement isentirely a different matter. The problem arises primarily because it ishealth that we are ultimately concerned with an it is also health that sofar has eluded most attempts at definition and measurement. There is agood deal of important and interesting h underway which is tacklingthe problem of developing a health status index (3,6,10]. However, theshort term prospects for a widely accepted and easily implemented index arenot good. Given this gap, there appear to be two principal alternatives. Onedefines underservice in terms of the presence of ill health and focuseson items such as mortality from various causes cr among particular popu- lations, restricted activity days, work loss days, or Z1-..lee incidence.The second concentrates on measures of either the use or availability of 550 3 medical care, e.g., physician visits and hospital admissions as use measures,and physician and hospital bed to population ratios as availability measures.As luck would have it, availability measures are probably farthest from whatit is that we're really interested in, yet readily attainable data make themthe most widely used. The second characteristic proposed is the ability to identify thesource of the underservice. Given that one area has lower health orgreater illness than another, what are the reasons for these differentials?In asking this question, it is important to emphasize that there is very likelymore than one reason for underserJice. This in turn implies that there ismore than one way to skin a cat. One need not, and in fact should not belimited to a single type of resource in attempting to compensate for perceivedmaldistributions. Thus, not only should our method identify the sources ofunderservice., but also their relative contributions or effects on the valueof the variable measuring underservice. We would like our method to tell us, on the one hand, whether theproblem lies in too few physicians, hospital facilities, or other medicalcare personnel. Or should we focus instead on factors like income levels,housing and sanitation conditions,, education, nutrition, or transportationservices'It is important to point out in this context that even if thelatter set of factors has a greater absolute impact than medical care, itdoes not at all follow that the former should be neglected. The costs andtime required to change environmental conditions could be enormous. If so,medical care might still be the best policy option even though is is notthe most important health determinant. 5 5 t; 551 4 Clearly, methods which define underservice is terms of either the useor availability of services have no difficulty in satisfying this secondrequirement.Just as clearly, however, they do so in a purely tautological fashion.to the extent that one is dissatisfied with defining underservicein terms of the physician to population ratio, for example, then knowingthat increasing the supply of physicians will alleviate the underservice is of little confort.The third desirable property is the ability to make cardinal comparisonsamong areas or populations. this is particularly relevant for measures ofunderservice which are defined as indices or composites of multiple factors.In particular, if one area has an index value of fifteen and another a valueof thirty, does this mean that the first is twice as worse off as the second?Should it get twice as many additional resources, assuming that we know whatthe relevant resources are/ Thus, unless we are interested only in relativerankings of areas, which for some purposes may be fully adequate, it isimportant that the measure of underservice permit cardinal as well as ordinal rankings.Finally, we would probably like the method of determining underservice to incorporate a meaningful allocation rule. Assuming that the first threeconditions are satisfied, how should additional resources be allocated andwhere do we stop? For example, should we strive for equal health, equal useof medical care, or equal availability/ Alternatively, are there minimumstandards or thresholds below which no area or population should fail/ IfJne brings resource constraints into the picture, as one obviously should,then another possible rule is to maximize the aggregate impact on themeasure of underservice, given the limited budget. Ultimately, of course,these types of considerations require political and social deliberationswhich transcend the more narrow technical calculations. 55, 552 5 III.Observations on Current Methods of Determining Underservice At noted in the introduction, some recent legislation explicitly requiresconsidering the adequacy of health manpower supply or the extent of under-service.For example, Section 1122 of the Social Security Act requires thatthe adequacy of the health manpower supply in an area be taken into considera-tion in certifying the need for new capital expenditures, including construc-tion.What is meant by \"adequacy\" or how that determination is to be madeare not specified. Similarly, the Emergency Health Personnel Act of 1970(P.L. 91-623), which created the National Health Service Corps (NRSC), theHealth Maintenance Organization Act of 1976 (P.L. 93-222), and the HealthProfessions Education Assistance Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-484) require theSecretary of DREW to designate health manpower shortage areas for the purposesof assigning HHSC personnel and forgiving medical education loan obligations. Again. 'Attie guidance is given other than suggesting criteria such as ...manpower to population ratios, indicators of need such as infant mortality,access to health services, health status, and the number of foreign medicalgraduates\" (17). What methods have been used to make such designations? Early in 1976,the National Center for Health Statistics analyzed variations in infantmortality by State Economic Areas (SEA) (7). The Rural Health CoordinatingCommittee later decided to designate any SEA which was among the highestfifty in either white, non-white, or total infant mortality as a High InfantMortality Area )14). The Bureau of Health Manpower defined in CriticalMedical Shortage Area (for physicians and physician extenders) as an areawhich has a ratio of resident population to fulltime equivalentr non-federal, primary care physicians greater than 4000:1 (16). (Adjustments are made tothe ratio if there is a continguous area which has a population to physician 1,7,1 (..-3 553 6 ratio less than 2000:1.) Finally, the Bureau of Community Health Servicesemployed the Index of Medical Underservice to designate medically underserviceareas for the federal HMO program [51. Identification of the ranking criterion in the first two cases isself-evident.More problematic are how the cutoff point was chosen and,perhaps most importantly, what implications the particular ranking orcriterion has for health manpower distribution or policy. In particular,the High Infant Mortality Area designation by itself conveys no informationat all about the availability or use of medical care resources or aboutother factors that might influence geographic variations in mortality.Conversely, use of the population to physician ratio says nothing aboutthe health state of the population. Furthermore, the single cutoff point,even if based upon expert opinion and average conditions, fails to take account of the extensive geographic variation in population characteristics,physician characteristics, the availability of hospital beds and non-physicianpersonnel, as well as variations in geographic and environment conditions (1,13].The Index of Medical Underservice (IMU) is the most sophisticated aproachtaken no far [5]. Using a variety of techniques, groups of experts in threestates made consensus assessments of the scarcity of personal health servicesin communities in their states. Statistical techniques were then used todevelop a set of weights for combining four variables (physicians per 1,000 population, percentage of the population below the poverty level, percentageof the population age 65 and over, and the infant mortality rate) such thatthe composite index produced a ranking which would be consistent with theexpert assessments. On average, the model explained about sixty percentof the variation in local experts' assessments. 55J 554 7 Even if the DIU can successfully rank areas, its major difficulty is that it suggests very little about the sources or causes of underservice,or what policies might be used to address the problems (19). Further,because the MI is an artificial index with no ready interpretation, itspower is United to ordinal rankings. Thus, one cannot make meaningfulcomparisions across areas, nor is there any obvious way to select the appro-priate cutoff point. This problem was illustrated by two studies (8,12)which compared adequately served and underserved non-metropolitan countiesdesignated by the Bureau of Community Health Services. There were nostatistically significant differences in physicians' patient loads, hoursworked, and appointment waiting times, or in households' medical care use and medical conditions.Although this has been a fairly cursory review, it points out some of the difficulties faced by existing methods. In fairness, however, it shouldalso be emphasized that most of these methods were designed only to determineeligibility for certain programs. For these purposes, they may functionquite adequately. If, however, designation of underservice plays a moredirect role either in allocating program funds or in determining reimburse-ment levels, then more work seems needed. The next section proposes anddescribes an effort in this direction. 5 6 o 555 8 IV.An Alternative ApproachThe conceptual framework for the proposed alternative approach is theeconomic theory of production. Very briefly, this theory is a representationof how firms combine resources to prouuce final products. One result is a set of general rules which a firm cap folio, to minimize its cost of producing a given level of output. In effect, these rules guide the efficient allocationof inputs, given their prices (e.g., various wages, material costs, andinterest rates) and the nature of the production technology (i.e., the setof technical factors which govern or limit tho way in which the inputs can be comitned).In order to apply this theory to the problem under discussion, let usassume for now that the first criterion identified in Section 1I is satisfied,i.e., there is an acceptable measure, either positive or negative, of health.(This assumption will be relaxed in the discussion of h implications.)Let us also think of health as the final produ:t which results from combiningmedical care with other relevant factors which affect health, such as behavior, heredity, and environment. While there is obviously no organized company orfirm which consciously chooses health output levels and corresponding combin-Lion* of inputs, one can nevertheless conceive of a statistical relationshipwhich could be referred to as a production function, i.e., a relscionshipbetween an output, health, and a set of inputs and technical corstraints, medical care, behavior, etc.The advantage of this analogy is that it suggests the concept of themarginal product, which is simply defined as the change in output for a smallchance in the quantity of one input when the quantities of the other inputs are held fixed. Using general notation to represent the statistical relationship, e.g., 5 61 81520 0-81--36 factors.the mathematical definition of the marginal product is Just the first partialderivative of D with respect to H. or (2)Walt - fm(H.B.H.E). The exact value of t..e marginal product depends, of course, on the choice ofthe mathematical form to represent the function f, the estimated coefficients. and, most importantly, the values of variables M. IS, H. and E.When evaluatedusing values for a specific location and/or population group, this concept has two advantages. First, it relates the change in, say, the number of physicains to the change in health. Second, it takes account of the other resources and conditions of the area.This approach also suggests possible criteria for assessing the adequacy of health manpower supply. For example, one might postulate that the areaestimated to have the greatest need for physicians would be the one whereadditional physicians would have the greatest impact on the health indicator, given local conditions. This implies simply ranking areas on the basis of the computed marginal product of physicians. Note that such a ranking wouldbe cardinal as well as ordinal, in the sense that both relative and absolute differences between areas would have meaningful interpretations.A second possible criterion for defining adequacy might be based onasking what redistribution of physicians across areas would produce thegreatest impact on health, given existing distributions of health manpower and facilities. Again referring to the analogy of the firm attempting tocombine resources efficiently, the answer would be the distribution which ryb 2 557 10 equalizes marginal prsducts acrmis areas. Note again that this would notnecessarily be the same as equalizing health or equalizing the physician topopulation ratio across areas, essentially because of the influence of otherfactors.(This criterion also implicitly assumes that the cost of anadditional physician of a given type is approximately equal across areas.)A third possible criterion for defining adequacy could be based on someminimally acceptable level of health in an srea or for a population group.For example, given a socially determined target, say,, the average level forthe U.S., statistical estimates of the production function's parameCersand assumptions about the costs of the various inputs. it is a relativelysimple calculation to determine what mix of manpower could reach the giventarget at the lowest possible cost (13). In this allocation, resour.eswould be distributed so as to satisfy the condition that ch, marginal practiceper dollar spent on each type of manpower would be equal acroca both areasand types of manpower. Areas which had fewer physicians. nursese etc. thanthe quantities calculated void be those with inadequate supplies. Further-more, this approach would simultaneously determine manpower targets orrequirements for such areas. 558 11 V.Research Implications The analytic approach described in the proceeding section may appear,at first blush, both complex and mysterious. However, an initial approx-imation of the relationship represented by equation (1) can be estimatedwith readily available data. The most obvious candidate for the dependentvariable is an area's mortality rate, either adjusted for variations in age,sex, and race distributions, or defined for specific age-sex-race cohorts.Medical care resources could be measured by stocks of different types ofhealth manpower and health care facilities available in an area.The model'sother variables could be approximated by a number of population and areacharacteristics variables. To date, a number of studies have demonstratedthe promise of this approach at the state level (2,4,11,18). Further ref inement, however, is clearly needed in several areas.First,more work is needed on defining the appropriate dependent variable. Oneapproach, noted above, is to develop some type of health status index.Alternative and more intermediate approaches might focus en mortality ratesdisaggregated by cause, rates of disease prevalence, or morbidity measuressuch as restricted activity days or disability days. However, use of cause-specific mortality or disease prevalence rates requires much better inputdata on the quantities of medical care services or resources used to treatparticular diseases and conditions. Morbidity measures are more general,in that they summarize the effects of essentially all diseases and conditions.Their shortcoming is that they are much more subjective than mortality ordisease prevalence measures, since terms like restricted activity or disabilityrequire individual interpretation In addition, each of these possibledefinitions shares the common problem of measuring only one part of the healthspectrum. 56 559 12 Researchers obviously have little choice but to focus on each of thesepartial measures until an acceptable and easily implementable health statusindex is available. This does not invalidate, however, studies usingmortality or morbidity as dependent variables. If findings regarding thedistribution of medical care resources are similar, then policy implicationsvill still be relatively clear. On the other hand, if results are incon-sistent for the two measures for example, making more physicians availablemay reduce mortality but increase morbidity), then this identifies an im- portant policy dilemma which might be masked by an index measure. Resolvingsuch a dilemma is primarily . social and political issue, rather than aresearch issue. A second needed refinement relative to earlier health production functionresearch is focusing on geographic areas smaller than the state. The stateis generally too aggregated a unit to deal with current concerns over resourcemaldistribution Disaggregating to the county level, however, is also in-appropriate because of cross-county travel patterns. Two promising possibilitiesare the Census Bureau's designations of State Economic Areas and County Croups.Dividing states into SMSAs and non -SlSA county groupings is anotherapproach, although some needed data for non -S1SA counties may be difficult to obtain.Alternatively, one could simply use the EMSA as the unit ofanalysis, although this clearly precludes investigating urban/rural distribu- tion problems [9,15). Third, data on stocks of available medical care providers should be re- placed by information on the use of medical services. This, unfortunately,would require substantial expansion of existing data collection efforts Apossible alternative may be to use available data to explore the relationship 5 65 560 13-1.4 between the stock of available providers and the supply of medical careservices, the production function for medical care [9]. Onemight then extend inferences to areas for which direct observations onmedical care use are not available. Another possible source for medical care use data is insurance claimsrecords.Medicare, Medicaid, and selected private insurance claims filesare already being tapped for research purposes in some areas.Unfortunately,the fragmented nature of the private insurance sector probably precludesany =le of such data on a comprehensive basis. This would be a very richsource of information under a more unified health insurance system.Although the conceptual model underlying the analytic approach describedin this paper is quite simple, it is unlikely that these methods could beapplied successfully at the small area or local health planning level. Thereare generally too few data observations with probably too little variation copermit reliable estimation of the necessary statistical relationships. Thus,these uethods are applicable primarily at the regional of national levels.The principal role of small areas should be to supply local data and information which could be used to supplement and modify data available from centralized,national sources, such as health manpower and health care facility professionalassociations. If health planning is to become a meaningful component of the medicalcare system, then improvements in planning methods are needed. This p4,,erhas examined one part of the planning process, evaluating health manpowerdistributions. Existing methods have several major shortcomings. An alternative approach, based on the economic theory of production was outlined.Whilemany difficulties still remain, an approximate orof this method can beimplemented at the regional or national levels with existing data. Furtherrefinements, however, will require additional investments in data collectionactivities. 66 1.561 15 References AdaY, L.A.' Criteria for Determining Health Manpower Shortage Areas.
