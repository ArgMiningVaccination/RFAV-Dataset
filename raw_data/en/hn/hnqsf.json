A war for our minds, our bodies, our livelihoods, our hearts, in fact it could be argued that there is a war going on for our very humanness. We are at war with a powerful, invisible enemy. An enemy lurking in the shadows of our governments, our health authorities, and our media. We can no longer trust our own governments, health authorities or media to tell us the truth. We can no longer trust that these entities are working in our best interest. Or maybe we never could and it's just coming to a head. The coronavirus pandemic and the government responses worldwide have devastated or economies, torn apart our families, deprived our children of an education and have left our elderly to die alone. Experimental Vaccines? And now we are, for the first time in human history, facing the experimental vaccines using using novel, never before used mRNA technology. A vaccine, which certain powers want to see single every human being on the planet injected with. A vaccine, which was never tested in long-term clinical trials and in most cases not against an inert placebo but instead against other vaccines. Some of the novel coronavirus vaccines were developed or tested on cell cultures from aborted human embryos, which were rendered What will this do to us as human beings? How will this vaccine affect our bodies and minds? Our children and grandchildren? Future generations? The fate of humanity? Nobody knows. How can we respond to such a war? Legal Options and Education There are legal option, which are already being deployed around the world, thankfully. In case you are not aware of this, You can find plenty of useful information there, including how to file a claim Rocco Galati is also leading another legal challenge about to be filed here in BC to sue the BC government organized by There are many other legal efforts going on in Germany, Austria, Europe, the US and elsewhere, which is terrific, but will take time. In the US, the Children's Health Defense In Germany, the More information here: Education What else can we do? We can help to educate others, including our families, friends, strangers, and government representatives. Share the word, share the reliable website such as I encourage all of you to call and to write to your representatives and express your concerns directly. Unfortunately I'm not sure many of our elected representatives are listening. Spiritual and Energetic Warfare or Countermeasures? So what else can we do? We can engage in energetic and spiritual 'warfare', spiritual martial arts if you will. How? Thoughts and intentions are powerful, they are forces to be reckoned with, especially when administered in a group. Research has shown that focused intention sent by a group of at least 8 people can have very interesting effects on many different living things as well as on water and even on machines. Perhaps some of you are familiar with the work of Her experiments have included people sending healing intentions to plants, polluted water, human beings and even to countries and regions in the world affected by war. The Power of Intention Did you know that a group of people in Australia can affect the growth rate of grass seedlings in a lab in America simply by sending positive intention to the seeds? It's been done and measured. Repeatedly. Healings of every kind of condition have been reported as a result of small and large groups of people sending healing intention to sick individuals. And - wait for it - in a number of experiments focused intention sent by groups of people appeared to be associated with drastically reduced levels of violence, even in war-torn countries. Every human being is born with this ability! Think about it. What if we had one or several small or large groups of people sending healing intention to our government representatives? To the coronavirus? To Bill Gates? And it does not take much time, only ten minutes at a time! We're not talking about hours of sitting in meditation, that is laudable but not too practical for most of us, ten minutes once a week or every two weeks or once a month with a minimum of 8 people, that's it. Intention Experiment to address Covid-19? In fact, Lynne conducted a number of large-scale intention experiments at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic aimed at reducing the virulence of the virus by 25% each time. And what happened? The dire predictions of millions of people dying like flies from the virus never materialized. Of course, there could be many reasons for that but what if the focused intention that Lynne and many others engaged in did help? What if these kinds of things thwarted the efforts of the shadowy elements driving this situation, at least to some extent? Maybe it did help, maybe it didn't help, but it certainly didn't hurt. And here is the kicker folks, not only did people engaging in these kinds of experiments and groups reported healings, better jobs and relationships among others, they also reported a profound sense of connection and oneness with each other. This, friends, is human nature, connection, love, oneness, let's use it against the 'so-called' enemy! Contact me to start a Group Let's start a group or a few groups and send focused intention to the governments, to Bonnie Henry, Adrian Dix, John Horgan, the legal system and the media. Totally counterintuive at first, isn't it? I have to get over gagging myself believe me, especially with Adrian Dix, but that just means he needs it the most! Hey it's something we can do, it costs nothing, it will make us feel very good and it may just make a difference. Spiritual warfare, friends! Who is ready to fire? Anyone interested in starting or being part of a group please contact me let's do it. Thank you so much! Anke Zimmermann, BSc, FCAH 0 Comments Your comment will be posted after it is approved.
