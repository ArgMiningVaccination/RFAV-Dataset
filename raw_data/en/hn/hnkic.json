Volume 4, Number 1 January-February 1981 **************************************************************** NOMINATED AS HHS SECRETARY: Senator Richard Schweiker, who has been nomin- ated as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, was co-sponsor of the \"Proxmire Bill\" in 1974. The FDA had proposed a limit on the potency of over-the-counter vitamin and mineral preparations. The proposed limit was 1.5 times the RDA of any vitamin or mineral. The Proxmire Bill specifically restrained the FDA from setting this limit. The FDA took the position that megavitamin therapy required proof of efficacy. The bil\\ was opposed by FDA, American Institute of Nutrition, American Society for Clinical Nutrition and other profes\u00ad sional groups. It was promoted by National Health Federation, which mounted a massive letter\u00ad writing campaign, and the bill became law. Sen!ltor Schweiker, during the hearings, criticized the FDA Commissioner, who was present, for not setting the RDA for.vitamin B6 at 25 mg. Such a level would be\u00b7 impossible to reach by any conceivable human diet that did not include synthetic B6. PLACEBO EFFECTS ON CATARACTS: An area in which quackery thrives involves nostrums sold to older people who fear surgery and impaired vision due to cataracts. Many fake medications have been successfully promoted for cataracts because visual acuity changes spontaneously in cataracts. It is estimated that a 30% \u00b7to 50% improvement in eyesight could be expected even if \"bottled dishwater\" were used as eyewash. (JAMA 238:7:627, Aug 15, 1977).

RUSSIA HAS QUACKERY TOO: The free-enterprise system lends itself to the promotionalism which ,is the essence of quackery to be sure, but\u00b7 apparently even the Soviets,.are not without the prob\u00ad lem despfte the availability of \"free and qualified\" medical services to everyone. Medical charlatans are reported to be doing business on the side (SF Sunday Examiner & Chronicle 1-4-81,l p A~6). Among the quack remedies reported are eggshell and tooth powder diets, walnut extracts, one-nostril breathing exercises, purification diets, prolonged enemas, needles inserted into the liver area, and more. LAETRILE PROMOTER NOW MAKING ARTHRITIS CLAIMS: Dr. Harold Manner who claims to have found Laetrile effective in mice* now says he's made a major breakthrough in the treatment of\u00b7 arth\u00ad ritis. His treatment is similar to the Laetrile-centered, \"metabolic therapy.\" It includes a juice diet and analysis for ~itamin and mineral deficiency followed by administrations of super oxide dismutase, homeopathic concentrations (!PPM) of poison ivy and four others. (From: Total Health, December 1980). Dr. Manner is still taken seriously by some because of his associ\u00ad ation with Chicago's Loyola University. With this new claim his incredibility grows. *(These claims have not met the normal standards of cancer research.) UNPROVEN ARTHRITIS.l,lEMEDIES: There has been a flurry of new unproven arthritis remedies appearing on the scene; here is another: Oxycal . This is simply a vitamin C food supplement (which also reportedly contains a small amount of calcium) sold through health food outlets. Its developers have not even tried to obtain FDA approval as a drug or done controlled trials. Nevertheless, it's being promoted in news reports as an arthritis \"breakthrough\". Past studies of vitamin C have shown no benefit for any of the major forms of arthritis. We are asked to be on the alert for the promotion of unproven arthritis remedies like Oxycal, green-lipped mussel Toukuwan.

CHIROPRACTIC ANTITRUST PLOY: Chiropractors collectively are suing 10 different medical (including osteopathic) organizations claiming their exclusion by orthodoxy constitutes a violation of the Nation's anti-trust laws. Since medical practice is a business as well as a clinical and scientific enterprise, the strategy is to attack it from the perspective of its business aspects only as if the scientific dimension were unimportant. Whether or not this clever ploy will succeed is being decided in Federal Court in Chicago. The article by Stephen Barrett, MD in this issue of the Newsletter tells how medical profes8ionals can cope with chiropractors attempting to use this method of acceptance. RICHARD PASSWATER: Those who follow nutrition pseudoscience will immediately recognize Passwater as the author of Supernutrition (New York: Pocket Books 1976) and four other books on nutrition which promote megavitamins. Passwater has been widely publicized as a biochemist, nutritionist, and holding a PhD degree. He is a member of the National Advisory Board of _!11~ Healthview Newsletter and writes for health foods magazines. According to an article in People magazine. (12-15-80) Passwater received his degree from Bernadean University in Las Vegas. Correspondence with the Nevada Commission on Postsecondary Education reveals that Bernadean University has never been accredited or approved by the State of Nevada. Bernadean claims to be connected with the Church of Universology. Interestingly, even the Rodale Press thinks little of Bernadean. Readers of The Practical Encyclopedia of Natural Healing were warned of its misrepresentations {p 266). Mr. Passwater runs the Solgar Vitamin Company's research center in Maryland. Could this be another case of using freedom of the press to carry on a form of hidden advertising by a vitamin entrepreneur, or are we too suspicious? THE NEW HEALTll ROBBERS IS NOW AVAILABLE AT THE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS BOOKSTORE. PSYCHIC SURGERY DEBUNKING TEACHES A LESSON: On December 12 the Subcommittee on Paranormal Health Claims of the Committee to Scientifically Investigate Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) met at UCLA. Professional magician James (\"The Amazing\") Randi demonstrated how the \"psychic surgeons\" of the Philippines perform their sleight of hand illusions which make it appear as if they have opened the body cavity, removed diseased tissue and closed the incision without a trace of having made a cut. Randi has helped the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) produce a film debunking the procedure. The film showed that although disease victims believed themselves to have been cured, all had died within months--except for one who had gone to the \"psychic surgeons\" to save his eyesight and he had gone blind. Incredibly, after the airing of the TV special showing how the fraud is perpetrated, the only question asked by more than 200 telephone call-ins was \"How can we arrange to go to the Philippines for treatment\"! This demonstrates just how desperate sick people can become. Publishers and media programmers should realize that all many people need is the location of another place to try when they are grasping for straws. The notion that an open marketplace should exist in the care and treatment of terminal illness is unrealistic. The only way to control quackery and its abuses is through legal penalties. Quacks eventually will kill someone who could have been cured by proper treatment-\u00ad it's only a matter of time. GOOD BOOK: Recommended reading effective against the false myths, quack cures, and so forth is A Surgeon's Book of Hope by William Nolen, MD (Publishers: Coward, Mccann & Georghegan, 1980). It is well written and presents the \"up\" side of medicine. HEALTH FOOD STORE ADVICE: Stoffer, et al surveyed ten health food distributors by having individuals \"seek out the supervisor or 'nutritionist'\" of each establishment. These investigators stated that they were being treated for goiter and asked if they had products that would help. All ten said they did. Two advised discontinuing medical treatment. Among the products recommended were: raw gland preparations, parsnips, parsley, malt tablets, kelp and others. (JAMA 244:18:2045-6, Nov 7, 1980). NATIONAL ENQUIRER BLASTS CHIROPRACTIC \"SUCCESS SCHOOL\": National Enquirer (11-18-80) reporter Lee Harrison managed to register himself in a practice-building course for chiropractors offered by Sid Williams, DC of Atlanta (Williams was featured by CBS 1160 Minutes\" last year). Harrison's opening line was: \"Chiseling chiropractors--hell-bent on ripping off the public with their quackery--have sunk to an a11...:time low in their lust for money.\" The reporter goes on to describe the tricks that were taught chiropractors so they could \"cash in on your pain and misery. . The disgraceful lesson. was simply this: convince your patient chiropractic can cure anything--then once you get your claws in--never let go.\" This is not simply another example of exaggerated sensationalism by The Enquirer. CCAHF has a copy of Williams' practice\u00ad building manual and has collected his materials for years. Williams is but one--and not the biggest--of the chiropractic \"success school\" operators. (Copies of the article are available free to CCAHF members--all others send $1.00 for postage and handling.) **LATE NOTE: CHIROPRACTORS LOST IN THEIR ANTITRUST SUIT AGAINST TEN MEDICAL GROUPS. STEVE Mc QUEEN'S \"DOCTOR\": It. has been reported in the media that de-licensed orthodontist William Donald Kelley's claim to expertise in cancer treatment is based upon the remarkable fact that he cured himself of a \"diagnosed\" case of cancer of the pancreas. An account of his purported diagnosis and cure can be found in his book One Answer to Cancer {Grapevine, TX: Kelley Research Foundation 1969). Kelley begins by invoking the name of God as he swears by his method of treatment: \"In light of Jesus' teaching, 'Physician Heal Thyself,' I can truthfully say that I have cured or healed myself of cancer (malignancy). I can cure myself again if it ever becomes necessary. Better still, I have learned God's Law of Health concerning malignancy (cancer) and I will ever invoke this Law that I will not have the disease again.\" (p 1). Next, he makes a statement in which he claims to have not only known exactly how long he had cancer but precisely how much longer he had to live. \"I had cancer three years and seven months before it ever dawned (emphasis ours) on me. At the height of the cancer I had only three weeks and five days to live.\" (p 2). Kelley then goes on to describe his self-diagnosis. He says he first began to \"belch\" and \"pass gas.\" Next, he needed bifocals at age 35 and experienced a \"long, long horrible period of mental depression.\" He reports that his \"thinking became fuzzy, unclear, irrational\" and that he developed a hernia. He then reports his \"diagnosis:\" \"I was feeling so badly that I reluctantly returned to my physician. He admitted that there might be something wrong with me and sent me off to a specialist. After many tests and three months' time, he made the suggestion that I have my pancreas biopsyed. This was quite a shock to me, and it then dawned (emphasis ours) on me the tru\u00b7e condition of my body.\" (p 3). --- Nowhere does Kelley state that he had a biopsy done. He confirmed his suspicions by using a \"bio-chemical test\" he had invented himself. \"By this time I had found a very reliable bio-chemical test for the early detection of cancer \". It took me about two weeks to overcome the shock and accept my fate. Then I decided to run our bio-cheinical test on my own family. The results were deeply shocking. My wife, two of my three children, and my mother had cancer, also.\" (p 4). \"Kelley describes this marvelous test: \"The most accurate and extensive cancer detection system ever developed is THE KELLEY MALIGNANCY INDEX.* This evaluation determines the presence or absence of cancer, the size and growth rate of the tumor, the .location ~f the tumor mass, prognosis of the treatment,~ of the tumor, and the regulation of medication for treatment. We prefer to use this system of evaluation and find it far superior to any other method of detection.\" (Emphasis ours) (p 13). It now becomes clear why he believes himself able to know exactly how long he had had cancer and the amount of time he had left to live. Finally, he describes the treatment he used to \"cure\" his cancer which again involves his own creation: \" We call our system of cancer therapy Ecological* because the total person and his total environment must be considered in order to give proper treatment. \"We have found that halting or stopping the malignant growth is relatively simple. The clinical problem in treating a cancer victim is clearing the body of accumulated toxins.. The growth is usually stopped from within 3 hours, to 12 days of Ecological treatment, depending upon the amount and method of administration Many cancer victims have had their tumors successfully treated only to die of toxic poisons as the mass is dissolved and excreted from the body: the clinician treated the disease and not the patient, or failed to treat Ecologically.\" (p 14) *Both of these were reviewed and found wanting by the American Cancer Society (CA: A Cancer ~?urnal For Clinicians, Nov/Dec 1970, pp 372-374). This case again demonstrates the tremendous power of the mass media to spread nonsense, From all appearances no reporter has bothered to check the veracity of Kelley's claim of self-cure, Kelley is also founder of the Nutritional Academy, an Illinois-based degree-mill which certifies \"nutrition counselors,\" a members of the Board of Advisors of The Healthview Newsletter, developer of the \"Computrition 500\" computerized nutrition program being marketed by VM Nutri Inc. of Wisconsin, and the \"Research Director\" of the International Health Institute iri Dallas, Texas. page 5 The califomia ~nclt Against Health Fraud, Inc. ,l,/IJ~.J~J~~.1\"1 Box 1278 Loma Linda, CA 92354 Stephen Barrett -- to,re.new YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY OTJIER NOTICE BESIDES THAT STAMPED BY THE MAILING LABEL ON THE NEWSLETTER THAT YOUR MEMBERSHIP HAS EXPIRED.* PLEASE MARK. \"DUES\" ON YOUR CHECK AND INFORM US OF ANY CHANGES YOU WISH TO MAKE IN YOUR CLASSIFICATION.

Th~ California Council Against Health Fraud, Inc: Volume 4, March-April CA NATIONAL NEWS COUNCIL UPHOLDS COMPLAINT: A complaint against Peopl~ magazine filed by Victor Herbert, MD, JD, President of The American Society for Clinical Nutrition has been found warranted, The complaint charged that People misled the public by giving the appear\u00ad ance of reliability for \"Dr.\" Richard Passwater and \"his PhD\" from Bernadean University in Las Vegas and for promoting in that article that readers should take large quantities of food supplements as sold by Passwater's employer, the Solgar Vitamin Company and other vendors. A previous successful NNC complaint against US magazine for misrepresenting Kurt Donsbach 1:rnd his \"university\" has been published in the !larch/ April 1981 issue of Columbia Journalism Review, Vol 19, No 6, pp 93-94. HOW TO COMPLAIN TO THE NNC: The NNC takes complaints from any individual or organization concerning inaccuracy or unfairness in a news report. The procedure to follow in filing a grievance is simple: Write to the news organization and send a copy of your complaint to the NNC. If you are not sure to whom to address your complaint at a news organization, send it directly to the Council, A copy will be forwarded to the appropriate news executive. If your complaint concerns a printed news report, include a copy of the report, the name of the public\u00ad ation, and the date. If your complaint concerns a radio or television news report, include the name of the station, the name of the network, and the date and time of airing. Be sure to include as specific information as possible as to why you are complaining. Complaints should be addressed to: The National News Council, One Lincoln Plaza, New York, NY 10023. HEALTH STORE CURES CONDEMNED: Julian DeVries, Medical Editor of The Arizona Republic (Phoenix) visited a health food store feigning illnesses such as weight loss, poor appetite, insomnia, psoriasis and nighttime leg cramps. Clerks sold DeVries $124.34 worth of vitamins that, according to a doctor, easily could have worsened the conditions he reported having. The clerks claimed to know \"what they were doing in recommending tne vitamins\" because they had been given a \"three-week course in vitamin nutrition.\" He was also sold a book which has a purported \"nutritional cure\" for almost. every ailmeni: known to man. (The Arizona Republic, March 8, 1981, p 1 and A-2.) SELLING FOOD SUPPLEMENTS: At least three large companies which sell food supplements are systematically turning their customers into salesmen. Shaklee Corp. claims to have \"hundreds of thousands\" of distributors. About two-thirds of its $411,331,000 1980 income was from nutritional products. The Neo-Life Company has more than 100,000 distributors primarily in the western U.S. Its 1980 income is estimated to be well over $200 million with 70% from vitamin sales. Amway Corp. claims more than 750,000 distributors worldwide. About 20% of its $825 million gro5s income was from the sale of food supplements. These facts come from a new book by Dr. Stephen Barrett, The Great American Hustle, soon to be released. FLUORIDATION REAFFIRMED IN AUSTRALIA: The Committee of Inquiry Into the Fluoridation of WatPr Supplies commissioned in March, 1979, has told the Victorian State Parl.iament that no new evidence was found challenging the safety or effectiveness of fluoridation. The evidence claiming that fluoridation is harmful was dismissed as opinionated and without scientific merit. (ADA News, Nov 24, 1980). NOTE: According to Let's Live magazine (March 1981, p 21) HHS Secretary Richard Schweiker is \"anxious to hear testimony that fluoridation of public drinking water causes cancer on large scale.\" YELLOW NO. 5 PRODUCES ALLERGIC REATIONS: The FDA has issued final rulings on effecive dates for warning labels on foods and drugs containing yellow No. 5 (TARTRAZINE). This substance causes allergic reactions (including bronchial asthma) in sensitive people.

RAW MILK CAUSES ILLNESS IN OREGON/CALIFORNIA: Fifty-two of 91 Oregonians yielding stool isolates of Campylobacter fetus (an infectious microorganism excreted by up to 60% of healthy cattle) gave a history of raw milk consumption. Subsequent studies of exposure to pets, livestock, raw eggs, raw meat, untreated water and exposure to other people implicated raw milk as the vehicle of infection. In California, a four-and-one-half-month-old infant was stricken with Salmonella saint paul infection following the use of Certified raw milk. (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, March 6, 1981, Vol 3, No 8.) These infectious microorganisms are killed by pasteurization. The continued use \u00b7of raw milk and belief in its superiority is the result of continued promotion by irresponsible constituents of the health foods industry. NEW ARTHRITIS DRUGS OVERPROMOTED: Two new drugs still in the testing and approval stages have received sensationalized publicity by the tabloids--and a third is apt to be similarly pub\u00ad licized soon. Benoxaprofen (trade name Opren) was inappropriately called a \"breakthrough\" by The National Enquirer (March 10, 1981). Orgotein was labeled \"a miracle\" by the National Examiner. The story misrepresented The Arthritis Foundation's position, misquoted its spokes\u00ad person and grossly exaggerated the drug's potential according to Charles Bennett, Vice\u00ad president of Public Education for the Foundation. NEW FLUORIDATION FACTS BOOKLET AVAILABLE: The Department of Preventive and Community Dentistry at Loma Linda University is making available a copy of Fluoridation Facts: Answers to Questions About Fluoridation to recipients of the CCAHF Newsletter. Send requests to CCAHF, Box 1276, Loma Linda, CA 92354. THE BIG QUACK ATTACK: MEDICAL DEVICES: This is the title of an FDA booklet which outlines the methods of quackery, identifies some specific devices and tells consumers what to do including where to report complaints. It can be obtained from the FDA's office of Public Affairs, Rockville, MD 20857. Ask for HHS publication No. (FDA) 80-4022, or call an FDA district office: Los Angeles (213) 688-3776; San Francisco (415) 556-0318. \"CELLULITE\" DEVICES SEIZED: Devices known as the Galvastim GP 18 muscle stimulator have been seized by the FDA in California. These devices are accused of making false and mislead\u00ad ing claims for treatment of \"cellulite\" and other conditions as well as inadequate labeling. SCHWEIKER OPPOSES DELANEY AMENDMENT: HHS Secretary Schweiker is sponsoring a bill (S 587) which would delete or alter the Delaney Amendment which requires the removal of food addi\u00ad tives which produce cancer in man or animals. The Delaney Amendment sounds good but has proven to be unrealistic in the face of modern technology's ability to detect the presence of substances in ultra-minute amounts which may produce cancer when given in unrealistically huge dosages. While most well-informed people appear to agree with Schweiker's proposal, the health foods industry has long applauded the Delaney Amendment because it has probably caused more public paranoia over the food supply than any other single factor. It will be interest\u00ad ing to see how this bill affects the friendship Schweiker appears to have with the health foods industry. IRS BARS COSTS FOR UNPROVEN CANCER REMEDY: A couple tried to deduct $9,580 they had spent on health foods, yogurt, bottled water, etc. prescribed by William Kelley, DDS (de-licensed); the individual who treated the late Steve McQueen. Kelley's diagnosis of the wife's cancer was questioned by the tax court as was the vaiidity of the diet treatment. (Wall Street Journal, Jan 28, 1981.) IMPORTANCE OF PROPER MANAGEMENT OF CANCER PATIENTS: Often overlooked in debates about proven vs. unproven methods of cancer treatment is the proper management of a cancer patient. Segaloff (JAMA, Jan 9, 1981, Vol 245, No 2, pp 177-179) points out that \"the most common metabolic consequence ~f being host to a malignant disease is hypercalcemia (elevated serum calcium level) which is potentially lethal.\" Many hazards attend any serious illness besides the disease itself. The trend toward radical dietary manipulation has its own attendant dangers. CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGES FORM ALLIANCE: Life C~iropractic College of Marietta, Georgia, the creation of chiropractic success promoter, Sid E. Williams, has formed an alliance with Pacific States Chiropractic College, San Lorenzo, CA. Williams' questionable practices have been the subject of a number of reports by the media. This alliance can hardly be viewed as progress for the California health care consumer. Page 2 FOOD SUPPLEMENTS TOUTED AS VD CONTROL: Herpes Type II is the most recently discovered venereal disease. Many of the afflicted are incurable and are destined to be plagued with the problem until science finds a solution. As Jacobson says \"it's in areas where our knowl\u00ad edge is inadequate that quacks find fertile ground--and they plow it well!\" An articl\"e in Sexology Today exemplifies Jacobson's observation. Included in the nonsense is the claim that sugar makes the immune system sluggish, lysine tablets should be taken, other nutrients decreased--and most absurd--.three to 10 grams a day of Vitamin C should be used. [The author should have read \"Vitamin C and Phagocyte Function\" (Nutr Reviews, June 1978, Vol 36, No 6), or Shilotri and Bhat, \"Effect of Megadoses of Vitamin C Activity of Leukocytes\" (Am J Clin Nutr 30:1077-1081, 1977), which show that two grams daily of Vitamin C impairs leukocytic phagocytosis.] TRYPTOPHAN SUPPLEMENTS MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO EYES: Edward Cotlier, MD, Professor of Ophthalm- ology at Yale, has observed that Tryptophan is known to yellow and brown the lens and may be involved in the formation of cataracts. (JAMA, Dec 12, 1980, Vol 244, No 23, pp 2593-4). Correspondence with Dr. Cotlier on the questionable practice of taking Tryptophan supplements as a \"mood enhancer\" elicited the opinion that this practice may be deleterious if done on a regular bas is. ZINC SUPPLEMENTS LOWER HDL'S: High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are the \"good cholesterol factors associated with a reduced incidence of heart disease.\" Supplementation of 220 mg zinc sulfate (80 mg elemental zinc) reduced the HDL of 12 men 23-35 years old by 25%. (JAMA, Oct 24/31, 1980, Vol 244, No 17, pp 1960-1). Zinc has been touted as beneficial and without harm in large amounts. This study shows again that excessive amounts of a good thing may become a bad thing. WHO IS A COMPETENT NUTRITIONIST? One of the major problems facing the health consumer today is the proliferation of pseudo nutritionists doing private consulting, selling food supplements door-to-door and working in health food stores. Unfortunately, since there are no licensing laws governing these practices anyone can call themselves a \"nutritionist.\" Until the legis\u00ad lature does something to correct this situation, it's \"buyer beware.\" James J. Kenney, PhD (Nutrition) of Nutrition Associates, Inc. of Santa Monica offers these guidelines: (1) Membership in the American Dietetic Association; this professional organization checks the education and training of everyone applying for membership. Those with inadequate education and training are denied membership. Members may take a registration exam to become registered dieticians which is usually required before they can work in a hospital. (2) Graduate work in the nutrition field; anyone with a MS, PhD or ~ll'H in nutrition should be a reliable source. But be very careful that their degree is from an accredited university. Unfortunately there are many people with PhDs in nutrition from unaccredited schools. Degrees from unaccredited schools mean nothing. The holders of such degrees are usually, if not always, quacks. \u00b7 (3) Sale of food supplements or other health products; anyone selling supplements which they are also prescribing is at best unethical and at worst a charlatan. These people should be viewed as salespeople, not as health professionals. Anything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. (4) Check with your physician; your doctor may be able to refer you to a competent nutrition\u00ad ist. If you do see a nutritionist, discuss what they've told you with your doctor. The medical profession is not perfect but a blanket condemnation of medical doctors by a nutritionist strongly suggests quackery. (5) Nutritionists do not diagnose or treat disease; if yours does then (s)he is not only a quack but also practicing medicine illegally. (6) Methods of nutritional assessment; the use of unproven, untested and unreasonable methods of evaluating nutrition status strongly suggests quackery. Some of the more popular questionable methods include psychic powers, cytotoxic tests, kinesiology (muscle testing), iridology, pendulums, amino acid fractionation tests, hair analysis (does have a few legitimate uses), and urine pH testing and pulse testing for food allergies. (7) Routine use of fasting, enemas, colonies, digestants and other so-called detoxification products and procedures certainly suggest quackery even though on rare occasions may be useful. (8) Guarantee; any nutrition counseling service providing nutrition information to the public should be willing to return their clients money if its counselors are unable to supply them with accurate and up-to-date information.

SEVEN DIE FOLLOWING CHIROPRACTIC \"COLONICS\": The Colorado State Dept of Health has reported an outbreak of amebiasis (a disease of the large intestine caused by the invasion of the submucosa by a protozoa). Thirteen cases were confirmed, seven were fatal. All had received colon irrigation--a series of enemas to \"wash out the colon\"--in a chiropractic clinic, (Morbidity and .Mortality Weekly Report, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Mar 13, 1981, Vol 30, No 9). COMMENT: The notion that the bowel needs cleansing regularly is based upon the long-defunct intestinal toxicity theory still advanced by naturopathy. The usual defense of an incident like this one reported above is that orthodox medical practices also sometimes result in tragedy (ie, anaphalactic shock following penicillin injection, surgical deaths, etc.) However, it seems clear that a distinction must be made between misfortune resulting from unproven or disproven practices vs. conventional care. These involve unnecessary added risk without evidence of benefit. NATIONAL SECOND SURGICAL OPINION PROGRAM: Provides information for people who are faced with non-emergency surgery. A toll-free number is available to assist the public in locating a surgeon or other specialist. (800) 638-6833; (800) 492-6603 in Maryland; (202) 245-7897 in DC). PREDIGESTED PROTEIN PRODUCTS FOUND NUTRITIONALLY INADEQUATE: A study of eight commercially available predigested protein products were analyzed for their elemental (mineral) composition and found wanting. (Jones et al, \"Elemental Content of Predigested Liquid Protein Products,\" Am J Clin Nutr 33:2545-2550, 1980). SINGLE-NUTRIENT EXCESSES OR DEFICIENCIES: Can impair the function of the immune system. Deficiencies of iron, zinc, vitamins A and Bl2, pyrodoxine and folic acid; or excesses of essential fatty acids and Vitamin E are cited. (Beisel, et al, \"Single-Nutrient Effects on Immunologic Functions,\" JAMA, Jan 2, 1981, Vol 245, No 1.) The California Council Against Health Fraud, Inc. \"',,1,1,1.;-\" .I ;I ;I .IN Volume VOTES EXPANSION: We have seen CCAHF grow from an idea in 1976, a chartered non-profit corporation in 1977, to a highly-visible, credible organization to which many different people (reporters, academics, professionals, laymen, other voluntary health agencies, community groups, etc.) turn for information and help. The need for the kind of services -CCAHF provides and its wide acceptance led the Board of Directors to the inescapable conclus\u00ad ion that expansion is inevitable in order for the Council to fulfill its potential. After almost a year of consideration, the Board voted during its April 29, 1981 meeting to markedly expand the activities of the Council and change it from an all-volunteer agency to a funded, fully-staffed agency. The plan calls for hiring a fund-raiser on a fee-for-service basis whose assignment is to raise about $100,000 for 1982. When sufficient funds become available, a full-time director and office secretary will be employed to administer the agency and con\u00ad tinue the fund raising effort. As more funding is obtained, the next phase would be to establish a university-based Consumer Health Studies Center with a part-time direotor and at least one research assistant. Included in the plan will be the on-going services of a public relations firm whose task it will be to keep in the public eye CCAHF, its positions on consumer health issues, and individuals who CCABF believes need to be heard. CCAHF SPEAKS Otl'l' OH DIET/DELINQUENCY LINK: After reviewing proponents' claims that diet is a major underlying cause in criminal behavior, CCABF President, William Jarvis, PhD, has spoken against this proposition in a statement aired on KNX news\u00b7radio in Los Angeles. ''We are completely in favor of improving the dietary habits of anyone--including delinquents whether or not a link exists with criminal behavior,\" Jarvis said. \"However, proponents of the supposed diet/ delinquency link are claiming to have scientific evidence of a cause/ effect relationship. A review of the basis for such claims is glaringly inadequate. Improve\u00ad ments in behavior of probationary delinquents reported by Probation Officer Barbara Reed of Ohio easily may be confusing cause and effect. Disorderly living and thinking would undoubt\u00ad etlly be reflected in poor dietary habits and bringing order 111ld discipline to the lives of these youngsters would be expected to be seen in their eating habits,\" contends Jarvis. \"The usual response to such criticisms is 'who cares whether it's cause or effect, as long as it Nrka.' Our response is that anyon\u00b7e interested in truly understanding the problem should be ftrY concerned that we don't fool ourselves by slopp,-science. This can lead to focusing on the wrong solutions to the problem, wasting resources and even endangering the public by turning criminals loose on society who have been led to believe their deep-rooted psychological problaas are simply due to 'junk foods'. What happens when one of these people explode emotion\u00ad ally despite their eat:lng habits! Also, as often happens, whenever attention :ls given to such pseudoscience, a bizarre collection of proponents with pet theories rush to be in the limelight and proclaim their notions. These have run from hypoglycemia, megavitamins, and color therapy to negative ions and food 'allergies'. The result is confusion and chaos. To our chagrin, LA County politicians are indulging these people and initiating policy based upon poorly founded claims. One of these requires the removal of salt shakers from the dining halls at juvenile halls. Concern has been expressed that those involved in work crews and heavy exercise may be exposed to heat prostration during hot weather by this act. We are all concerned about crime and want - . to .see it reduced,\" adds Jarvis. \"Besponsible leadership doesn't rush to pseudoscience for its solutions.\" The NewZettez, is published birw:mth'l,y by PEARSON, popularized by the Merv Griffin TV show, has been appearing recently in KFM:&-TV San Diego as a \"science reporter,\" Pearson has extolled the alleged value of a variety of food supplements in terms local members of the scientific community have called misleading and inaccurate, CCAHF members in the area have actively sought to correct the media mis\u00ad information which reportedly has been a boon for the local health foods stores. The follow\u00ad ing article by CCAHF Board Member Harold Loeffler, PhD, occasional science writer for the San Diego Union, describes the situation. RESPONSIBLE JOURNALISM A television station and its newscasters should have the same responsibility to confirm their stories as do newspapers even if they are not of the stature of the Washington Post or the National Enquirer. For this reason San Diego scientists have been objecting to the inaccurate panaceas recited by Durk Pearson on Channel KFMB television. The media has been especially lax in confirming the scientific validity of food and health information even though some may be harmful, There is a precedent for heavy liability, A grieving mother won a $150,000 settlement from the estate and the publisher of Adelle Davis books. Seems the mother followed Adelle instructions to give her daughter megadoses of Vitamin A. The child's growth was permanently stunted as a result, The California Council Against Health Fraud has received uniformly negative comments when taped transcripts of Pearson talks were submitted to specialists. Pearson suggested eating 3 grams of choline every day along with Vitamin BS, \"MIT students given this dose showed improved memory and intelligence.\" \"People in their 70's and SO's given choline often have a greater feeling of well-being and improved memory. 11 ''Hyperkinetic children given choline will show an improved mental focus and ability to concentrate.\" However, in the very references- be quoted the researchers injected choline and speci~ically state that choline given orally as Pearson recommended is metabolized to trimethylamine\u00b7 and 1a not converted to the neurotransmitter \"acetylcholine\" as Pearson states. They suggested that choline can get into the brain by eating lecithin which contains choline in its molecule; an easier way to get the choline is from eating eggs which contain lecithin. 1'he average person would probably not improve his memory with choline from whatever source, The researchers injected scopalamine before the choline which blanks out the action of any choline or acetylcholine already in the system, They started with a clean empty state and did find improved memorization comparing added choline with its complete absence. An individual with a normal amount of choline in his system would probably have no better memory with the added surplus amounts. The elderly with poor memories and the beginning of \"senile dementia\" do have a shortage of acetylcholine but it is due to poor performance of the enzyme that converts choline to acetylcholine rather than any shortage of the choline itself. World famous expert Dr. David Janowsky of UCSD adds that \"Choline in high doses can cause mild to severe depression in susceptible people so it has effects on well being but in the wrong direction. I do not know about its use in hyperkinetic kids or MIT students but doubt this is true on the basis of other controlled studies of its effect on performance,\" Excess choline or acetylcholine can be harmful and possibly lethal. If the body cannot get rid of excess acetylcholine the nerves will keep firing and the body go into catatonic shock as it does when poisoned with nerve gas or the strongest of pesticides. Person suggested nutrients could replace tranquilizers particularly the use of a vegetarian di.et. \"Such foods lack those amino acids that are converted to nor-adrenaline-a substance that excites you,\" He admits such a diet. devoid even of milk and cheese would trigger multiple vitamin deficiencies and protein inadequacies. Page\u00b7 2 Dr, Janowsky disagreed, \"There is no controlled evidence in man that going on a vegetarian diet causes a decrease in nor-epinephrine (ie, nor-adrenaline) or that nor-epinephrine increases particularly from eating meats, or that nor-epinephrine causes aggression in man.\" Janowsky continued in more emphatic fashion. \"If people who need psychiatric drugs for psychoses or depression think they can do without them simply by going on a vegetarian diet, the increase in morbidity, mortality and even violence in these patients increase as they stop their needed medications. The assumptions of this report are naive and potentially dangerous!\" Pearson presented nine talks on taking care of your hair, As a younger man his comb would be covered with a hundred hairs and tody his comb has very few, Re ascribed the change to his various nostrums that he says has also cured his dandruff. He emphasized as a hair nutrient the amino acid cysteine which he stated \"is relatively uncommon in human diets and in women may be the limiting factor in the growth of their hair.\" \"In many cases it is actually possible to double the rate at which a person's hair will grow simply by giving them additional cysteine.\" He is dead wrong. Cysteine is very common and is presant in most proteins. Furthermore, Dr. Paul Saltman of UCSD has added that cysteine is not an essential amino acid and the body could synthesize it if it were lacking in a diet. Dr. W. Mangara, Director of the Oregon Primate Research Center disputed all of Pearson's hair advice. Dr, Mangara is about the world's leading authority on hair. Re has written the key books on the subject and was the keynote speaker at the 1975 World Conference on Hair held in Japan. Mangara says there is no way to increase much less double the rate of hair growth by taking cysteine. The rate of hair growth is almost constant at about 0.3 to 0.4 mm per day. The hair follicles are programmed ,to grow hair for a varying length of time. The follicle cell below an eyebrow may grow hair for only a week while that below a pony tail may go on.producing for eight years. file fewer hairs on Pearson's comb would occur as he got older irrespective of all his dosage. tiangara pointed out that a young adult has 100,000 to 150.000 hairs on his head. About 10% of the underlying cells are always in a resting phase of about 100 days. When a hair cell comes out of the resting phase it starts producing a new hair and usually pushes out the old hair so it showed up on the younger Pearson comb at an expected 100 hairs per day. As we get older the hair cells stay much longer in the resting stage so less new hair is starting and fewer old hairs are getting pushed out to show up on the older Pearson comb, It is that simple. Pearson claimed that the strength of hair can be increased and sometimes kept from greying by pills ad diverse at Vitamin E, Vitamin A, selenium sulfite (reducing dandruff) or para aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Mangara said they were all useless. Since industry is sometimes ahead of academic researchers, the suggestion of Saltman was followed and the specialists at Proctor and Gamble back in Cincinnati were contacted. They are probably the biggest manufacturers of hair preparations. They had found all of Pearson's remedies useless-or they would have put them in their own products. Pearson prescribes Vitamin A saying if you don't have enough your hair will fall out. Re also believes with too much Vitamin A your hair will fall out. How can he explain the millions of Americans who don't take extra Vitamin A and whose hair is not falling out? Pearson said Vitamin A has anti-oxidant properties. He is wrong. It is not an anti-oxidant, He recommends 10,000 supplemental units per day even though the average diet easily provides the Reco111111ended Daily Requiremmt of 5000 units. Dr. John Todhunter of Catholic University, Washington, DC along with Saltman here are certain these S1110unts are definitely toxic. Pearson admitted the toxic storage in the liver of this amount of Vitamin A but suggests a dnc supplement will reduce the ill effects. He is unaware that supplemental zinc can reduce the beneficial HDL portion of cholesterol. Page 3 'l'hueAave been so many ill effects of people dosiq themselves with Vitamin A that health authorities suggested it be sold only by prescription but special interests have blocked the move. The Council bas accumulated additional transcripts and additional negative conments but the pattern is the same. The presentations of Pearson are not in accord with scientific facts and the users of his information may suffer serious harm. Should that be permitted just in the name of free speech? Should it not be obligatory for the TV station to provide the scientific rebuttal and correction? The Council is now requesting such equal time. --Harold J, Loeffler. PhD LOMA LINDA The so-called \"T-J Diet Plan\" is being circulated with the claim that \"Loma Linda Hospital promises\" that a person can lose 10-17 pounds in 10 days and llfeel like a million. 11 The Nutritional Services Dept of the LLU Medical enter disclaims the plan and further states that (1) it is not nutritionally balanced (2) makeE extravagant claims. and (3) does not teach good food habits necessary to maintain weight once lost. RAW MILK POISONINGS: Additional reports of raw milk poisonings by Salmonella and CampYlo- bacter have been reported fr0111 Montana and Kansas respectively. It is interesting that the dairy in the first instance only sells raw milk at the plant and in the other case the dairy voluntarily stopped selling raw milk. This is very different from the situation in California where raw milk is agressively promoted despite sicknesses and deaths which have resulted from. its use. CHINESE HERBAL B!MBDY BLAMED IN DEATH: Chuifong Toukuwan. a Chinese \"herbal\" medication has been blamed for the death of a 70-year-old Georgia woman who was taking the drug for rheumatoid arttlritis. Investigators have found that the '\"herbal\"- also contained _several prescription drugs which can cause serious adverse effects. Interestingly, samples\u00b7varying so widely t~ some preparations contain. altogether different substa1'ces. Apparently when a consumer purchases Chuifong Toukuwan it is like buying a \"pig in a poke\"--which may turn out to be a killer_! (FDA Consumer. 198~ pp\u00b7 29-30). SBA SPONGIS toxic shock syndrome (TSS) has 110t gone unnoticed by the \"natural is better\" ilk. Sea sponges are being sold in s0111e areas for use as tampons. These have not been shown to be safe and effective. Analyzed specimens have been found to contain such \"natural\" contaminants as arsenic, iron, sodium, sulfate, hydro\u00ad carbou and nicotille. \u00b7 'l'Wo cases of TSS in women using sea spoages have been reported by the Center for Disease Control. (FDA Consumer, May 1981, p 30). \u00b7 Jl1 THE LLtT BOOKSTORE: Books of interest to CCAHF Newsletter available in the Loma lltnda Univere:f.ty Cllapus Bookstore fnclude Water Witching USA by and Vogt. a scientific ~k at this interesting pseudoscience which includes some good material on the scientific llwtking procesa; ~ Health Robbers, expanded, updated and illclexed, an excellent resource for many forms of quackery; Consumer Health: A Guide to Intelligent Decisions.

Page 4 THE COST OF CULTISM: Taylor Straight Chiropractic Center (Det?'Oit) placed a newspaper ad stating \"Your Child Does Not Rave to be IMl1UNIZED Por School.\" It continued by saying, \"Would you let your child have live puss from sick animals or the use of dead bacteria put into their veins?\" \"Straight\" chiropractic cultists believe that adjusting the spine enables the body to ward off infectious diseases by \"nerve flow.\" Ironically, one of the few deaths from diphtheria reported in 1979 involved the 5-year-old son of a California chiropractor who had signed a waiver against immunizations. (FDA Consumer, March 1981, p 32). BCG FAILS TO PROTECT FROM CANCER: Due to the abuse of BCG by certain fringe practitioners. as a cancer treatment (it has also been used experimentally by responsible researchers), a report by Kendrick and Comstock (J Natnl Cancer Inst, 66:3:431, March 1981) is of interest. In 1950 nearly 17,000 people were vaccinated with BCG. Comparing their cancer incidence with that of over 17,000 controls found no protection effect against cancer. LIBERALIZED LAETRILE BILL DEFEATED: State Senator William Campbell's attempt to permit fil!I_ doctor or surgeon to prescribe. Laetrile rsceived only one vote--hia own, The passage of such a bill would be a boon to California's maverick and fringe medical practitioners who profit on the irrational hopes and fears of desperate cancer victims, Campbell claims his continued pressing for liberalizing Laetrile's use is due to his belief in freedom of choice. He seems oblivious to the fact that free choice is a God-given attribute of human beings not something granted by politicians. Cancer sufferers are free to eat apricot pits or whatever else they choose as a cancer remedy--but they can't sell it to others! The law forbids the exploitation of cancer victims by fraudulent or misguidedentrepre'iieiirs:\" This is what Campbell really has been pushing for all of these years. We wonder if ha is as fond of the free-choice concept when it comes to issues like a woman's right to choose an abortion? We suspect that even Campbell places limitations on how much free-choice the health marketplace should sustain, His free-choice argument appears to be a ploy he uses to cover his real intent for liberaliz\u00ad ing Laetrile.

FTC ORDERS\u00b7 llEll'tJNDS: Two 1111111 order companies selling products claiming to \"cue\" baldness and \"eliminate\" cellulite fat do aot have adequate scientific evidence of effectiveness, says the Federal Trade Commission (PTC). They are asking a Federal District Court to order Braswell, Inc. and Standard Be~earch Laboratories, Inc. to make refunds to customers and to bar them from using certain illegal practices in the sale of their products. (FTC News Summary, Apr 3, 1981). Page 5 PUTTING DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS IN PERSPECTIVE: Fredrick Stare, MD, Emeritus Professor of Nutrition at Harvard, has put dietary recommendations for people at risk as succintly as anyone yet. He says, \". if you have some of the risk factors known to relate to diet-- - obesity, an elevated blood pressure, an elevated cholesterol level--then some dietary changes may be helpful, and the thoughtful, prudent individual should certainly make them First, cut down on total calorie intake which for most of us means less meat, less cheese and whole milk products, and less alcoholic beverages. Second, increase physical activity so as to use up more calories. The combination of these two suggestions will result in weight loss and usually in lowering of blood pressure and blood cholesterol. Third, if blood cholesterol is not decreased by this weight loss, then a decrease in saturated fats, an increase in polyun\u00ad saturated fats, and a decrease in dietary cholesterol (fewer egg yolks) is in order. Fourth, if the weight loss does not result in a satisfactory decrease in blood pressure, then dietary salt should be reduced, and drastically.\" (Nutr Today, Sept/Oct 1980, p 19). We believe this uncomplicated bit of general advice will be supported by nutrition scientists everywhere. NUTRITION HALL OF FAME A SHAMEi The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSP!) has chosen their first ten inductees into their so-called \"Nutrition Hall of Fame.\" Included among some who deserve some acclaim (such as Jean Mayer) are Adelle Davis whose unsound nutrition advice has resulted in death and debility to several children; J. I. Rodale whose publications may have spread more nutrition misinformation than any other single source; Benjamin Feingold whose theories on hyperactivity and food additives have not held up to scientific scrutiny and, in our opinion, caused research dollars to be wasted because of the manner in which his ideas were popularized instead of following established scientific protocol; Nathan Pritikin who has made a name for himself but still has failed to scientific\u00ad ally demonstrate the validity of his claims;--and others not quite deserving of major acclaim. CSP! also has a Nutrition Hall of Shame. There appears to be some confusion on their part as to who belongs where! WIIJi;rAM H. PHILPOTT, MD: Dr. Philpott is an \"orthomolecular\" practitioner and a member of the Advisory Faculty of Donsbach \"University.\" Philpott has engaged in some strange practices over the years including abuses in discipline at.the Green Valley School for retarded and problem adolescents in Florida. These included disciplining with electric cattle prods, forcing boys to dig their awn graves and sleep in them, chaining students together by the esck, and forced fasting in solitary confinement. He also has treated so-called \"cerebral allergy\" with co2 inhalations, a procedure which resulted in the death of a woman under his care so111e years Dack. These facts can be found in Medical World News, Aug 11, 1975, p 81. Dr. Philpott was acquitted of manslaughter in his patient's death (New York Times, July 24, 1974). Dr. Philpott is one of the \"experts\" being quoted by proponents of the theoretical link between diet and criminal behavior. CALIFORNIA TUMOR REGISTRY WON'T PUBLISH FLUORIDATION/CANCER STUDY: Donald Austin, MD, MPH, \"'Chief, Resource for Cancer Epidemiology Section and California Tumor Registry of California's Dept of Health Services, has stated in a letter to the National Institute of Dental Research (dated April 15, 1981) that they would not be publishing their findings which found no associ\u00ad ation between fluoridation and cancer. The reasons given are that they feel the supposition has been adequately addressed by scientifically unimpeachable groups and they do not wish to become embroiled in a pseudo-scientific controversy. Their findings have been sent to \u00b7 Governor Brown. ARTHRITIS QUACKERY A ONE BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS: The economics of quackery is always difficult to determine so we take information from wherever we can. The Arthritis Foundation states in a June 4, 1981 press release that the nation's 31.6 million arthritis sufferers spend about a billion dollars a year on quack products and treatments, ARTHRITIS BLAMED FOR POOR NUTRITION: Poor nutrition is a result of arthritis rather than its cause according to two medical reports presented at national scientific meetings of the Arthritis Foundation June 5, 1981. A study in Wisconsin found that arthritis sufferers pre\u00ad pared poorer meals because of their pain and impaired function. A New York study determined that 73% of subjects reported improvement on some kind of \"diety therapy\"--no matter what kind. \"Improvement often correlated with weight loss, which would decrease stress on inflamed joints,\" a researcher noted.

Jarvis, PhD Aaoodah: Profossor of Preventive and Dentistry Loma Unda Univel'>lty School of Dentistry Loma Unda, CA People become food faddists for many different reasons. It may result simply from misinformation, from an out growth of deeply held philosophical beliefs, or from a health neurosis. Most individuals who are immersed in faddism can be placed Into one of two categorle -the Deceived and the Deluded. The Deceived mainly need accurate information and perhaps some assistance with logical reasoning. The Deluded require much more ef. fort and may even be beyond help. The Dacelved and Deluded cannot be dlffemlttated on the baill of what they believe or how strongly they appm1r lo hold their convictions. The test Is how they react when faced with substantive evidence that their beliefs are wrong. The Deceived will change, the De\u00ad luded . will not.

FLUIDOTHERAPY-,-UPDATE: In July of this year, a story announcing \"New treatment offers fast relief for 31 million victims of arthritis\" appeared in The National Enquirer. The story con\u00ad cerned .the use of tiny solid particles suspended in air to approximate the action of a liquid (fine-ground corn coos.which easily transfer heat). These particles are heated and olown about in a small oox into which a painful hand or foot are placed and heated to aoout 120F. Studies on this mode \u00b7of heat have appeared in several medical journals (1977, 1978, 1980). Generally speaking, fluidotherapy appears to produce some relief, roughly the equivalent of that of other traditional forms of external heat therapy such as paraffin and hydrotherapy. An Arthritis Foundation news release following the newspaper story criticized the sensational way in which fluidotherapy was proclaimed as a major breakthrough in arthritis. Some physical thei:apists who_ utilize fluidotherapy oojected_to the _release on the grounds that it might tie interpieted as classifying this form of treatment as unscientific. Properly used fluido\u00ad therapy is a safe and effective way to apply dry heat to painful, inflamed hands and feet. (Arthritis Foundation Public Information Memo, Sept 18, 1981.) CIGARETTES!1!)ST HEAv'Il.Y ADVERTISED PRODUCT IN U.S.: The U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs reports (Consumer News, Vol II, No 17, Sept 1, 1981) that the nation's _six major cigarette companies spent one oillion dollars to sell their product in 1980 making cigarettes the mosi. _heavily advertised item in the 1118-rketplace.

On the one hand they give credit to the chemotherapy but they still say they're comoining Laetrile treatments also. In doing so, they're still using the \"heads I win, tails you lose\" psychology.

SUNTANNING TABLETS SAFETY QUESTIONED: According to an article in People magazine. (July 27, 1981) the new suntanning pills 1118-Y produce problems in some people.

IF SO, SEND IT ALONG TO US WHEN YOU CAN. page 3 SUPER OXIDE DISMUTASE The July 28 issue of the National Enquirer carried a story on Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) entitled \"Look Younger--With Incredible Youth Pill. 11 The first paragraph is very explicit-\u00ad \"For as little as 25 cents a day, the fountain of youth can be yours-in easy to take pill form!\" The enthusiasm is maintained in the second paragraph, \"this incredible 'youth pill' makes you look and feel up to 30 years younger by firming up your skin, smoothing wrinkles and boosting your energy supply.\" The story parades a variety of so-called authorities who give eJtalllples of \"people in their 60's will look more like 35 or 40.\" One declaims \"It's a miracle compound. You can literally turn back the hands of time with this enzyme!\" \"People on SOD can actual,ly avoid having a face lift.\" So every health food store is sold out on their stock of SOD. The story was apparently triggered by a modest quote by Dr. Richard Cutler of the National Institute on Aging (a part of the National Institute of Health) to the effect that \"SOD may turn into a major breakthrough in health and aging.\" Cutler is aghast at the resulting article and its fanciful suggestions. Cutler insists as do other biochemists that SOD pills have absolutely no biological activity. SOD is an enzyme and like other similar proteins will be broken down by the digestive enzymes into its component amino acids before it can be absorbed into the circulation. It is like forcing a tennis ball through the small apertures in a window screen-the tennis ball has to be ground down to fuzz before anything will go through the small holes. The amino acids that wind up in the circulation will have no more of the characteristics of the original enzyme than the fuzz has -of the original tennis ball. Supere;,xid:e itsilf has valuable biological activity. Dr. Peter O'Toole of UCSD Medical School says it is combination of two oxygen atoms with an extra electron and is the active principal that enables the white blood cells in the body to overcome foreign P.roteins such as bac.teria and thus protects the body against disease. It is called a 'free radical. ' Somet111les the superoxide is called forth in excess amounts and these excesses. can cause a type of inflammation. Arthritis may be such an inflammation. Superoxide dismutase is the enzyme that destroys the excess of superoxide and if the body doesn't have enough of this SOD, local injections may be of help in overcoming the inflammation. Medical World News, back in 1979, carried an art.icle indicating that Diagnostic Data Inc., a California .firm, had formulated an injectable product by adding sucrose to the metalloprotein molecule which had been extracted from bovine livers. They named the new compound orgotein. It has been approved by the FDA as a veterinary drug and is widely used in treating .horses for arthritis. \u00b7 Diagnostic Data Inc. has submitted to tti.e FDA the\u00b7results of clinical trials on human rheumatoid arthritis. They claimed it was as effective as gold but with no side effects. It appeared to be more effective in the early stages than in the latter stages. An FDA advisory_colllmittee has reco1D111ended_ that approval be denied until better clinical 1:1tudies are accomplished; Local offices of the FDA don't know whether such further studies are under\u00ad way. A Swedish researcher claims (rom double blind studies that orgotein can reduce the side effects of radiotherapy. \u00b7 The article points out the tablets have only the name on the package allowing pill dis.pensers to claim \u00b7they are a natural food supplement and thus get around FDA jurisdiction. The research d\u00b5:ector cf Diagnostic Data admits the blood level of SOI) taken orally would be 'extremely low' and though they tried to keep rats and mice forever young with SOD it just didn't wor,k.. The SOD-must be injected locally since it has a very short life in the circulation. The safe dose . is only a thousandth or so of the amount in the cells of the body. For these reasons the SOD could not have the biological effects claimed by the Enquirer oven if it were injected. Dr. Vi~tor Herbert has suggested added SOD might have harmful eff,~ts or none at all since most enzymes are specie specific--that is work only with the animal specie from which they are derived. Dr. Charles Cochrane o;!: Scripps Research believes this is not a matter of concern since this particular enzyme is less specie specific than some. For example, it has been possible to inject boV'ineSOD from cattle into horses without calling forth antibodies or showing allergic reactions. Chemisi:s are trying to make SOD more effective and safer by tacking on other chemical groups that would allow the SOD to have a longer life span in the\u00b7 circulation. Smaller amounts then could be used and the possible ill effects of an excess be avoided. \u00b7-page 4 Dr. Cutler has found that there is.a correlation between the average life span of an animal specie and the average SOD found. For example, man has just about the longest life span among the primates and has the most SOD. Chimpanzees with a shorter life span have relative ly less SOD. Smaller monkeys with a shorter span yet have correspondingly less SOD. In animal experiments it has been found that the amount of SOD remains relatively constant during the life of an individual. Cutler did- find more SOD in elderly humans than in young people but he doesn't believe this means any increase with age. Those with less SOD may simply not have lived long enough to be part of the elderly study. Cutler has not found in animal experiments that injecting SOD has increased the life span. This might be expected since injected SOD would be in the circulation while the active beneficial SOD of the body is in the cells themselves. Researchers believe it is unlikely that circulatory SOD could get into the cells in significant amounts. It is difficult to explain the claims in the article of the wondrous results. Dr. Ellie Shneour points out that none of those quoted belong to the important nutrition or biological societies so are not recognized by fellow scientists as authorities. Their work has not been published in technical journals so has not been studied or reviewed by other scientists. Perhaps the placebo effect is the explanation. Many people insist they feel better when the doctor says the medicine should help--even when the pills are as inert as sugar alone. --Harold J.

The FDA considers the book an extension of the labeling of DMSO. However, the New York chapter of the ACLU looks at the seizure as book censorship and may take the FDA to court in a constitutional test. There is legal precedent to support the FDA position.

BOX 18'16, LOMA LINDA, CA 983S4. page 5 Malpractice Is An Inevitable Result: Of Chiropractic Philosophy _ And Training A chiropractor charges: Chiropractic is based on a false theory and its practitioners are inadequately trained in diagnosis PETEil J. MODDE, D.C. TWO YEARS AGO, a 47-year-old man con\u00ad sulted a chiropractor ror severe leg pain or three days' duration. 1be chiropractor did not remove the patient's trousen, shoes, or socks. lnscead, he examined only bis back, diqaosed \"lumbalaia,\" and manipulated tbe man's spine. Three tbe patient's pain persisted, he con\u00ad sulted a medical doctor who realized that the problem was a blocked artery tbat bad bee!I cutting down the cin:ulatioa or blood to the leg. Had the problem been diagnosed earlier, surgery could have removed tbe block. By this time, however, amputation or the leg was necessary. At first glance, this might appear to be an extreme or isolated case or malpractice. But my experience u a chiropractor and u an independent coasullaat in mal\u00ad practice cases has convinced me it is not. The chiro\u00ad practor was merely following what he bad learned in school. Chiropractic is based \u00b7oa a raise theory. 1 Its practitioners are inadequately trained in diagnosis, and most do not know their limitations. 1 Malpractice is an innitabl, result or these circumstances. Chlrapract:ic Philasaphy Chiropractic was rounded in 1895 by Daniel David Palmer, a grocer and \"magnetic healer\" who believed tbat almost aD diseases are the result or misplaced spinal bones. According to bis theory, \"subluxations or spinal vertebrae c:ause disease by interfering with the flow or \"nerve energy\" from the brain to the body's tissue cells. Spinal \"llijustments,\" by restori111 vertebrae to their \"proper places,\" allow brain energy to heal the diseased condition. It should be obvious that anyone wishing to treat a diseue would tint have to accurately diapose what needs treatment. But rollowers or D.D. Palmer's philosophy see things differently: . Their obligation is merely to examine the spine, find the subluxations, and correct them. A \"medic:lll diagnosis\" is unneces\u00ad sary. Not aD cbiropracton espouse this \"straight\" Palmer philosophy. The more modem cbiropracton, known u \"mixen,\" do talk about diagnosis. Antagonism exists between the two aroups. An interesting debate recelltly appeared in the stu\u00ad dent newspaper or the Palmer School or Chiropractic. Speaking from the mixer viewpoint was Louis Spor\u00ad teli, D.C., past president or said: \"Uterature the Chiropractic 'truth' bas reached an all-time high Wouldn't it be wonderful if the cause or HEAL 1J{ and DISEASE were u simplistic u finding the ever elusive 'subluxation' and then correcting it.\" \u00b7 Thomu A. Oelanli, D.C., president or the Sherman Sch_ool or Straight Chiropractic, replied: \"It is obvious that [SporteDi's editorial] wu written by someone ja, norant or chiropractic principles as ex~unded by D.D. Palmer ... Chiropractic will assume its-rightful role in society when those who claim to be chirpprac\u00ad tors stop wanderini all over the medical therapeutic world and use their fuD potential in runher developina the art and science or locating and correcting subluxa\u00ad tions.\" Sponelli then responded in a letter: ''The vut majority [or chiropracton J are tired or this ranatical concept and definition or what chiropractic is and is not ... Thea to add a note or tarnish to the silver tongued spokesmen ror super 'straight' chiropractic is the ~stion: Are the straights. ruUy straight, or do they gather at meetings and conventions to convince their rriends lhat they practice only that which is pure and principled straight Chiropractic? Only to return to the sanctuary or their offices 10 utilize_ blood tests, The chiropractor's legal duty is to: 'first, diagnose the patient's problem: second, if the problem can be treated by spinal manipulation, then he may proceed' nutrition, physiotherapy. vitamins, and yes, even diagnose. . . They advertise cures ror every condi\u00ad tion in materia medica. yet do not treat condi- tio\"s . ~ ,\u00b7 page 6 As far as the obligation to diagnose is concerned. lhe couns clearly side with\u00b7 the mixers. A hmgthy legal memorandum published in 1he journal of the American Chiropractic Association concluded: \"The legal duty of the .chiropractor. as with any other doctor, is to: first, diagnose the patient's problem; second, if the problem can be treated by spinal manipulation, then he may proceed; third, if he determines that the form of treatment required is outside the scope of his practice, then he must refer the patient to another doctor.\" Chiropractic Training Are chiropractors trained to accurately diagnose and refer? lnmy opinion, the answerisno. Toe \"straight\" schools are dominated by D. D. Palmer's philosophy and the .. mixer\" schools. are cenainly not free of it. Dr. Sportelli is probably correct that some straight practitioners are trying to diagnose, but it is also clear that most mixers believe that spinal problems are the basic cause of disease. To illustrate the scope of their work, almost all chiropractors use charts that sup\u00ad posedly show how nerves supply the body's vital or\u00ad gans. Chiropractic students, past and. present, have not been.\u00b7taughl by skilled medical diagnosticians. They are legally barred from usipg. many 4iagnostic tests that could be crucial to proper medical investigation. Nor are they able to study the care of patients in hospitals, Independent studies have concluded that chiropractic schools do. not adequately prepare their students to function as primary physicians.$~, Patient Risk Since chiropractors are licensed as \"doctors,\" most people who consult them expect to be \"properly medi\u00ad cally diagnosed.\" Patients also assume that if their problem is beyond the scope of chiropractic, they will be referred to an appropriate practitioner; Since these assumptions are usually incorrect, the more the patient relies on the chiropractor for diagnosis of bis case, the more vulnerable be will be. Patients who use chiro\u00ad practors as primary physicians, either because they don't know any\u00b7 better or because they have been turned off by orthodox medical care, run the greatest risk. There are two main types of chiropractic malprac\u00ad tice: I. Failure to diagnose conditions that require timely medical attention. 2. Damage from manipulation of body pans that have been weakened by disease or previous _trauma. Here are some cases I recc;ntlY reviewed: A 58-year,old woman consulted a chiropractor for low back arid.h:ft hip pain; The cbiropractor performed a cursory physical exam.and x-rayed only her lumbar spine. Dtagnosi.ng,.Jumbar nerve pressure syn\u00ad drome,.\" he manipulated her low back area with her left lc;g flexed. The patient's problem was actually a fractured hip. Manipulation disturb_ed the fracture and made normal healing impossible. As a result, the pa tient required surgical implantation of an anificial joint. A S:,ar-okl ma who consulted a chiropractor for low back p;iin w~ 1-rayc;d, examined briefly, and treated with spinal manipulation. Despite three pionrhs of treatment, his pain persisted and he consulted a second chiropractor who treated him in a similar fash\u00ad ion. When his pain persisted, be went to a medical doctor who ordered tests that led to a diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease. The patient's pain had been caused by swollen lymph glands. It disappeared with treat meat of his underlying disease. A 51-yeaNJld maa with back pain became paralyzed from the waist down after spinal manipulation by a chiropractor. Unknown to the chiropractor, the pa. dent's spine had been weakened by metastatic bladder cancer. The chiropractor's evaluation did not include a \u00b7medical history, an orthopedic evaluation, or a urinalysis. An x-ray film was taken but was of such poor quality that .it was diagnostically useless. A SO.year-old lllllll required surgery for a prolapsed lumbar\u00b7 disc that was ruptured by chiropractic treat\u00ad ment. Careful orthopedic evaluation would have indi\u00ad cated that what the patient needed at the time of bis chiropractic visit was not manipulation but bed rest and traction. A 63-year-old woman who relied ona chiropractor to treat her\u00b7for neck pain, headaches, nausea,\u00b7and diz2:i- 11e,s~ died as a of a brain hemonbage. Unsus\u00ad pected bythechiropractor, her symp.toms were caused by high blood pressure in urgent need of medical man\u00ad agc:Oll:ilt. A 55-year-old maa who consulted a chiropractor for pain in his midback, chest, and left shoulder was told that his pain was \"nerve pressure\" from a spinal sub\u00ad luxation~ His problem was actually a heart attack re\u00ad quiring immediate hospitalization. This last case is of particular significance because few conditions are less appropriate for chiropractic care than an acute heart attack! Case Involving Claims . A Pennsylvania chiropractor is now facing prosecu\u00ad tion -for advertising that \"intense, fearful constrict\u00ad ing chest pain\" is a reason to sec a chiropractor. Other ads figuring in the case claim that blum::d vision is a reason to see a chiropractor and that \"pinched nerves\" can cause abnormal blood pressure, hay fever. sinus trouble, arthritis, pleurisy, glandular trou\u00ad ble, goiter, bronchitis, colds as well as stomach, liver, kidney. and gallbladdet problems. At the preliminary hearing, a medical cardiologist testified that severe chest pain could represent a heart attack requiring emergency care and that:delay in get\u00ad ting such care could be faul. Seven chiropractors tes\u00ad tified in suppon of the advertising claims. Here is the testimony of one of them: Q; Sir, if S0'1\\CbodY came 10 you complaining of blurred vision, would you examine the eye? A. I would examine _the spine. I examine eyeryo11e's spine. Q. If .someone came to you complaining of goi\u00ad ter, would you examine the goiter? A. I would examine their spine again. Q. If someone came to you complaining of in\u00ad tense pain in the chest radiating down the left arm, would you examine, or would you at\u00ad tempt to examine the heart by using an elec\u00ad trocardiogram machine? A. I only check the spine for vertebral subluxa\u00ad tions. Q. Would you use a stethoscope to check the heart pain at that point if somebody came to you with their complaint? A. We don't use a stethescope in checking the pain. We only check the spine for subluxa\u00ad tions. At a subsequent hearing, the chairman of the Pennsylvania State Board of Chiropractic Examiners and faculty members from three of the nations' 13 chiropractic colleges endorsed the ads as accurate and representative of what is taught in chiropractic schools.

Although chiropractors enjoy undeserved status as primary care providers, they have become politically powerful. For this reason, it is unrealistic to expect state legislators to curtail their abuses or restrict their practices. Nor is it likely that chiropractic can build a safe and rational health care system on a foundation that is delusional. Malpractice litigation therefore may be the most effective way to alert the public to chiro\u00ad practic's dangers. A.ddttss PERMISSION) LEGAL ASPECTS Of MEDICAL PRACTICE O FEBRUARY 1979 RAW MILK ASSOCIATED WITH DEATHS AND ILLNESSES IN WASHINGTON STATE: An outbreak of Salmonella dublen infection in Washington state has been associated with drinking raw milk from a coDD11ercial dairy. Eighteen persons were infected from November 1980 to July 1981. Eleven victims required hospitalization. Two persons, a cancer patient and a diabetic, died. (Source: Morbidity and Mortality Report, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, Vol 30, No 30, Aug 7, 1981, p 373). It's worth remembering that deaths from raw milk induced Salmonella dublin poisoning in California also involved people with pre-existing serious diseases. Investigations found that the reason these individuals were drinking raw milk is because they had been led to believe raw milk might help restore their health because it was \"natural.\" The public should be told that designating raw milk as \"certified\" only means that cattle have been tested for TB--it does not offer assurance against Salmonella dublin, campylobacter or other such infections. SUCCESSFUL WATER FLUORIDATION PROMOTION: The state of New York is engaged in a non- controversial, low-key educational approach to the promotion of fluoridation.

SPIRILINA-A NEW FOOD FAD: Spirilina maxima is a blue-green alga which grows in brackish water. Women of the Chad Republic have gathered, sun-dried and sold it in local markets for years. The dried alga contains 62% protein, 2-3% fats and 16-18% carbohydrates and mineral salts. Health food pr01110ters have discovered spirilina and are marketing it as a \"miracle food.\" It is being called \"Light Force Spirilina,\" \"Spirilina Algae,\" and \"Spirilina Plankton.\" Often it is combined with other substances and given special trade names. Claima include: ''You'll lose weight and \"increased energy,\" \"less need for sleep,\".\"no hypoglycemia symptoms,\" and spectacular claims of nutritional superiority. The facts are that while spirilina is a nutritious food source comparing favorably to peanut meal in protein value (which is inferior to eggs, milk, beef or soya meal) the amount of money being charged by promoters staggers the imagination, Consu-rs are paying $10 to $23 for the same amount of protein available in 70\u00a2 (.26.lb @2.69/lb.) worth of Virginia peanuts. Spirilina is high in Vitamin B12, but in the amounts it is being sold the daily dose becomes insignificant. The claim that phenylalanine, an amino acid found in spirilina acts on the brain's appetite center to switch off hunger pangs so people eat less is refuted in the FDA Consumer, Sept 1981, p 3. (Further reading: Clement, et al, \"Amino Acid Composition and Nutritive Value of the Alga Spirilina Maxima,\" J of Science and Food Agriculture, Vol 18, 1967, p 497+). The California Council Against Health Fraud, Inc. J~ ~ j~ ~~ .J ~\"A\"~ AB 868 SHOUW BE-DEFEATED: The Assembly passed AB 868 by a vote of 47 to 27. If this bill becomes law, chiropractors in California would be permitted to function far beyond their current scope. Rather than being limited to \"the manual adjustment of the spine\" they would be recognized as \"concerned with the care of the human body in health and disease\" (Section 7.1); and defined as primary health care deliverers (Section 7.1.c.). Section 7.1.d permits them to practice \"physical or corrective treatment of any bodily or mental condition (emphasis ours). . . \" Other subdivisions of Section 7 .1 permits ''patient counsel\u00ad ing in nutrition, supplementation, special dietary foods, and specifies colonic irrigation, supportive orthopedic appliances, corrective and orthopedic gymnastic: and other rehabilitative measures.\" Section 7.2 enables chiropractors to \"E?tamine, analyze and diagnose (emphasis ours) the human body to determine sub\u00ad luxations and diseases (emphasis ours) ... \" This is a radical departure from traditional chiropractic. Chiropractors are notably deficient in their ability to diagnose disease and some even eschew its appropriateness. The chiropractic guild has never demonstrated its competence to perform such services but AB 868 nevertheless intends to grant such license anyway. Section 7.4 authorizes chiropractors to designate themselves as specialists. This will compound what is already a massive consumer deception. Chiropractic licensure by the state was originally granted in order to control the activities of these unscientific practitioners. Constant political activity has permitted chiropractors to use a stepping-stone approach to achieve wider and wider latitude. Legislators have been misled by chiropractic lobbyists into believing they are merely bringing the law into step with advances within chiropractic. This is clearly not true. ~ Chiropractor.shave certainly expanded the scope of their practices but not with scientific justiffcation. A recent study conducted by consumer health students at Loma Linda University found widespread abuses by chiropractors as to scope of practice. Chiropractors have expanded by salesmanship and patient indoctrin\u00ad ation--rather than by having advanced themselves scientifically. Recent trends in so-called \"holistic health\" in which even medical doctors, dentists and other recognized health care providers have abandoned the scientific rigor of their training and ventured into practicing by placebo effect, has been a boon for the unscientific chiropractors. Some legislators hide behind the argument .that if AB 868 passes, it will be referred to the people for ballot approval. To take the political position of \"let the people decide\"--like motherhood and the flag--is an almost unassailable position. The problem with it is that \"the people\" don't have the opportunity or sufficient interest to gain the insight needed for such decision. Legislators are placed in responsible positions by the voters and are expected to protect the public welfare. If AB 868 becomes law. the welfare of a significant sector of the community will be placed in jeopardy. Governor Brown is not to be trusted to act in the public interest because according to the October, 1980 issue of Chiropractic Economics he is a chiro\u00ad practic devotee. The last place to stop this dangerous and unwarranted legis\u00ad lation is in the State Senate. Do not be misled by chiropractic claims that this bill merely brings the law into step with modern chiropractic. It legalizes unscientific health care delivery. Chiropractic is as scientifically invalid today as ever. The few practitioners who approach chiropractic responsibl~ eschew the fundamental basis for chiropractic and limit themselves to manipulative therapy for musculo\u00ad skeletal complaints, in opposition to organized chiropractic. The Newslettet' is published bemonthly by The California Council Against-. Health Fraud, Ina., a non-profit, ta:i:-e:cempt, all-volunteer organisation, It is intended for CCA11F membero and ,others the Council 1,1ishes to QUACK SOLICITS FUNDS FOR SENATOR CAMPBELL: Convicted Laetrile peddler Dr. James Privitera has published a letter in the November, 1981, issue of Public Scrutiny soliciting funds for state Senator William Campbell. Calling Campbell a \"patriot\" who \"stands against the evil forces of government tyrants that are planning to limit your precious health freedoms . ~\" (by this he means those who protect desperate cancer victims from charlatans with worthless remedies who prey upon them). Campbell bas authorized several bills which sought to legal\u00ad ize quackery. These include Laetrile, chelation therapy for heart di~ease, permitting unqualified health foods store clerks to act as nutrition consultants, removing control of raw milk from the state Department of Health, and others. CCAHF considers Senator Campbell to be the California health consumer's worst enemy and quackery's best friend. Privitera's letter emphasizes the so-called \"Health Freedom\" notion which has thus far been organized quackery's most effective propaghnda weapon. It is a clever diversionary tactic which directs our attention toward the victim instead of the quack. We all are naturally sympathetic with victims of serious illness who beg for the chance to try the quack's nostrums. What is overlooked is the reason why the victim wants the treatment--because the quack has convinced him it offers hope. The laws prohibiting quackery are aimed at the sellers, not the buyers of these worthless nostrums. HEMATOLOGIST WARNS OF HARMFUL B12 BREAKDOWN PRODUCTS IN MULTIVITAMINS: Dr. Victor Herbert warns that Vitamin B12 added to multivitamin capsules contain breakdown products which actually may interfere with the vitamin's utilization. Herbert began studying the problem after seeing a 19-year-old female patient who had developed pernicious anemia despite having taken an over-the-counter vitamin preparation :during the previous year. Ber serum showed no intact Vitamin B12 but a substantial analogue level. Herbert says a solution to the problem of B12 break\u00ad down would be to leave it out of supplements altogether. (Ref. Med World News, Sept 28, 1981) \"NUTRITIONIST\" ACCUSED: James J. L. Jeffers, who holds a Ph.D. in communications psychology, operates \"Jeffers' General Orthotherapy Clinic\" in Englewood, Colorado. Law enforcement officials came down on Jeffers due to complaints they had received. In one case Jeffers reportedly prescribed vitamins ~s nutritional therapy and colonic irrigations to a woman patient suffering from potentially fatal system lupus erythamatosis. In addition she was advised to use goat's milk and cod liver oil. Jeffers claims he is being persecuted by the medical establishment because he uses nutritional instead of drug therapy.

(Ref. Vol 16, Number 2, Sununer, 1981) ECONOMICS OF VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTATION: According to CCAHF advisor Thomas H. Jukes, PhD of Berkeley, a year's supply of the RDA's of all eleven vitamins cost 85\u00a2 per adult American. Therefore, the total vitamin requirement of the US could be supplied for $200 million. Presently, vitamin sales are at the two billion dollar level. From these figures it would appear that the government is not the only one which wastes money! page two PRITIKIN DIET FAILS TO OUTPERFORM AHA DIET: An investigation comparing the high\u00ad fiber, low-fat Pritikin diet with the American Heart Association's moderate fat, fiber and cholesterol diet was carried out at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. Fifty subjects were assigned to each diet. All were urged to exercise 45 minutes daily and to restrict the use of alcohol, coffee and salt. The program lasted for one year. Subjects were tested for treadmill walking times, peripheral vascular blood flow arid several important blood chemistry factors. While both groups showed significant improvements in most of the tests (not peripheral blood flow) the differences between diet groups was not significant. Observers noted that improvements were more likely to be attributable to the exercise than the dietary programs. (JAMA, Voi. 26, No. 17, p 1871, Oct 23/30, 1981).

VALIDITY OF MIRACULOUS CURES AT LOURDES QUESTIONED: One of the most famous sites for purported paranormal healing is Lourdes, France where it is claimed the Virgin Mary appeared to a young girl in 1858. As many as 4.5 million people have visited Lourdes in a single year (1979) making it the third most popular tourist site in France. The church has been fairly conservative in its willingness to officially recognize purported miraculous healings. A medical bureau was established in 1882 because so many people seemed to be getting better while visiting the shrine. In 1978 i.t declared the healing of 41-year-old Serge Perrin the 64th official miracle in Lourdes history. , The criteria for an accepted cure seem quite stringent: recoveries must be \"sudden\" and \"unforeseen,\" and occur without convalescence. Illnesses must be \"serious\" or \"life-threatening\" and must include objective evidence of a distinct \"organic disorder.\" No disease with effective treatments available is accepted and cures must stand the test of time. All of these sound very good on the surface. However, a critical review reported in 1982 Medical and Health Annual of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (pp 129- 147) found Perrin's miraculous cure highly suspect. The report offers good insight into the problems of verifying paranormal healing. It is highly recommended for those interested in this topic. (Note: CCAHF president, William Jarvis, PhD, is co-chairman of the Subconnnittee on Paranormal Health Claims of the Committee to Scientifically Investigate Claims of the Paranormal-an organization which scrutinizes purported psychic phenomena including such things as UFOs, Bermuda Triangle disasters, astrology, ancient astronauts, etc.) LENDON SMITH'S FOODS FOR HEALTHY KIDS, NOT RECOMMENDED: Describing this new book as a rehash of an earlier work Feed Your Kids Right (also not recommended by several reviewers and described as \"dangerous\"), Environmental Nutrition (Dec 1981) reviewers state that while recipes in the book are fine, the rest of the book contains \"vague and misleading advice which parents would be better off without.\" MASSAGE BENEFICIAL IN RELIEF OF MUSCULO-SKELETAL PAIN, ETC.: Many extravagant claims have been made over the years for the bene.fits of massage. \"Naprapathy\" is the designation given to the therapeutic use of massage. Like other forms of ineffective therapy, naprapathy disappeared for a while but is being revived under the guise of \"holistic\" health care. The Arthritis Foundation points out that massage can help relieve tightness, soreness and pai~ sometimes. Such relief does not constitute therapeutic effectiveness, however. MEASLES INCIDENCE GREATER IN UNVACCINATED CHILDREN: Children with religious exemptions to vaccination were studied in Massachusetts and Ohio. They were found to be at increased risk (in some cases all exempted children developed the diseases: Throughout the US children are exempted from vaccination for religious reasons.

Cail 796-3067. page three WASHINGTON CHIROPRACTIC DISCIPLINARY DOARD SCANDAL: Washington Chiropractor De::-yle D. Hovinga pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of a nine-year-old patient (also giving her gonorrhea) in 1976. Hovinga's hlstory of sex crimes goes back to 1964. In 1977 he settled out-of-court a suit involving indecent acts with a 14-year-old. The bizarre part of this scandal is that the state Chiropractic Disciplinary Board took no action following these offenses. However, this same Board attempted to take away the license of another chiropractor, Peter J. Modde, for his public criticisms of the lack of competency of chiropractors to function as primary health care providers (see CCAHF Newsletter, Vol 4, No. 5, Sept/Oct, 1981). Modde eventually was vindicated of charges brought against him by the Disciplinary Board, alleging that he wrongfully prescribed vitamins and over\u00ad charged a patient, when the Washington State Supreme Court dissolved the Board as unconstitutional in 1978. Here .is a case where a sex offender was protected and a crusader for the public's welfare was attacked by an agency set up to protect the public from malpractice. As a result of this scandal all boards responsible for disciplining members of health professions will be open to the public. Comment: This bizarre situation certai.nly should not be too widely general\u00ad ized to all chiropractic Disciplinary Boards. However, it would be remiss not to point out that chiropractors appear extremely protective of their frar,ile public image--for good reason--they simply cannot stand close-scrutiny due to their cultism and pseudoscience. CCAHF has experienced protectionism by the California Board of Chiropractic Examiners on more than one occasion. It has become clear to us that the CBCE exists to protect chiropractors rather than the public. More will be written on this in future issues of the Newsletter. WHAT'S IN THOSE MEXICAN DRUGS? Many people report dramatic relief from arthritis after receiving drugs in Mexican clinics. They are generally told these drugs do not contain cortisone. An excellent article reviewing the Mexican-border\u00ad clinic phenomenon and documenting the contents of the drugs used is: Hindmarsh and LeGat t, \"Mexican Drug Therapy,\" Clinical Toxicology, pp 85-99, 1980. NATUROPATH JAILED IN DEATH OF PATIENT: Idaho naturopath Cyrus Maxfield was sentenced to 15 years in prison on 21 counts including manslaughter. Maxfield had been peddling sugar pills labeled as \"vaccines,\" utilizing real drugs such a.s digi talis--a potent heart drug. He also pretended to diagnose cancer in patients using hair and urine tests. One patient yied following a series of colonic enemas and an administration of digitalis. The results of this case compares unfavorably with another CCAIIF was involved with. Naturopath Kenneth Slawson charged with manslaughter, unlawful dispensing of prescription drugs and other criminal offenses was able to plea bargain his case down to pleading guilty to practicing medicine and administering prescription drugs without a license. Slawson was granted a withheld judgement, placed on two years probation and fined $500. If these differences leave you a bit puzzled or cynical about how juftice is meted out to quacks, you are not alone! FDA Consumer, Oct, 1981. FDA NIXES \"FAT MELTING\" CLAIMS OF BODY WRAP CREAMS: Nationwide promotion of \"body-wrapping\" for recontouring women's figures includes the use of \"body contour cream.\" Ads claim the cream will help melt away unwanted fat in just 60 minutes. The cream apparently produces a warming sensation leading naive consumers to feel like their fat is melting. The creams have not been reviewed, analyzed or approvecl by FDA, but the fat-melting claim has been poopooed in the November 1981 issue of the FDA Consumer (p 4-5). (Also see \"Cellulite: The Fat That Doesn't Exist But Costs a Fortune to Get Rid of,\" Shape magazine, September 1981. Reprints avai 1- able for $1.00 from CCAHF will include a reprint of \"CelluHte: Hard to Budge Pudge,\" FDA Consumer, May, 1980). REPORT SAYS PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION STRONG: Professor Stephen Greysen of the Harvard Business School cited a study showing very strong public support remainittg for consumer protection even though there is public objection\u00b7 to government. He noted that 65 percent of the public agrees that protecting consumer interests is \"so important that requirements and Rtandards cannot be too high antl contihuing improvements must be made regard1ess of cost.\" (Consumer News, U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs, Nov 1, i9R1). page four AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ALLERGY REAFFIRMS: FLUORIDES NOT ALLERGENIC: Anti-fluorid\u00ad ationists repeatedly have charged that fluoridation produces allergic reactions in sensitive people. Attempts to show proof of this have been transparently pseudo\u00ad scientific. At the. request of the US Public Health Service, the American Academy of Allergy evaluated the question in 1971 and issued the unanimously adopted state\u00ad ment, \"there is no evidence of allergy or intolerance to fluorides as used in the fluoridation of community water supplies.\" This statement was reaffirmed in February, 1980 by the Academy's Executive Committee.
