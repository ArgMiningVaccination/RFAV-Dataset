Agriculture consists of growing plants and rearing animals in order to yield and produce in a way maintaining the biological equilibrium in nature. It is the most important enterprise in the world. Agriculture helps to meet the basic needs of human and its civilization by providing food, clothing, shelters, fuel, furniture, medicine and recreation. It also provides raw material for Industries. Agricultural development is multidirectional having galloping speed and rapid spread with respect to time and space. Indian agriculture is unique in the characteristics, where over 250 different crops are cultivated in its varied agro-climatic regions. Uses of various sources of power from the human resource to the bullock and from tractors to combines are common. After green revolution, farmers started using high yielding varieties, fertilizers, pesticides and improved cultural practices in intensive cropping systems to enhance the production potential per unit area, time and input. Now India is not only food and nutritionally secure but has emerged as a net exporter of food grains and continues to forge ahead in the adoption and modification of many of the advanced technologies brought from other countries. The thought behind developing the course on Agriculture is to improve the skill of students through practical applications and to develop employability, so that they may explore post- secondary opportunities and career in each area of Agriculture. This Student Handbook on Introductory Agriculture, as part of skill development is being introduced to the students of IX standard will give an insight into the basic principles of agriculture and explain the various components of agro-based industry of our country. I congratulate everyone, who is associated in developing this book, which is a very useful resource for the benefit of the students. Chairman, CBSEviAcknowledgements Advisors Shri Y.S.K.

Ager means land or field and Cultura means cultivation. Therefore the term agriculture means cultivation of land. i.e.,the science and art of producing crops and livestock for economic purposes. Definition : Agriculture is defined as the art, the science and the business of producing crops and the livestock for economic purposes. As an art, it embraces knowledge of the way to perform the operations of the farm in a skillful manner. As a science: It utilizes all modern technologies developed on scientific principles such as crop improvement/breeding, crop production, crop protection, economics etc., to maximize the yield and profit. As the business : Agriculture as a business aims at maximum net return through the management of land, labour, water and capital, employing the knowledge of various sciences for production of food, feed, fibre and fuel. In recent years, agriculture is commercialized to run as a business through mechanization. Agriculture is now a holistic approach of growing crops and livestock in a proper manner to meet the food demand of the country, which is drastically increasing. Thus agriculture is now taken a form in which it has large number of identified units. These units not only provide farmers and growers an option of livelihood but also provide better need based farming options for the society. BRANChES OF A GRICUL TURE Agriculture is the branch of science encompassing the applied aspects of basic sciences. The applied aspects of agricultural science consist of study of field crops and their management (Aviculture) including soil management. There are a large number of fields under agriculture, as under. Plant Breeding/Genetics is the art and science of changing the traits of plants in order to produce desired characteristics. Plant breeding can be accomplished through many 2different techniques ranging from simply selecting plants with desirable characteristics for propagation, to more complex molecular techniques (see cultigen and cultivar). Plant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years, since near the beginning of human civilization. It is practiced worldwide by individuals such as gardeners and farmers, or by professional plant breeders employed by organizations such as government institutions, universities, crop-specific industry associations or research centers. Agronomy is the science and technology of producing and using plants for food, fuel, fibre, and land reclamation. Agronomy encompasses work in the areas of plant genetics, plant physiology, meteorology, and soil science. Agronomy is the application of a combination of sciences like biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, earth science, and genetics. Agronomists today are involved with many issues including producing food, creating healthier food, managing environmental impact of agriculture, and extracting energy from plants. Agronomists often specialize in areas such as crop rotation, irrigation and drainage, plant breeding, plant physiology, soil classification, soil fertility, weed control, and insect and pest control. Horticulture is the other important section of agriculture which comes from the Latin hortus \"garden\" and cultra \"cultivation\", from cultus, col \"I cultivate\". Hortus is cognate with the native English word yard (in the meaning of land associated with a building) and also the borrowed word garden. Cultivation and intensive focus to crops like mango, banana, sapota, guava and vegetables like tomato, potato, onion comes under this section of agriculture. Divisions of Horticulture Horticulture crops include fruits, vegetables, flowers, plantation crops, Spices, condiments, Medicinal and Aromatic crops etc. In addition to these, Horticulture also deals with raising of trees for shade, ornamental and avenue purposes, planning and raising of ornamental gardens, parks and raising of seed and planting material. Further, horticulture also deals with the utilization of horticulture produce and improvement of horticulture crops. Hence, based upon the crops dealt and also their purpose and utilization, the branch of horticulture is sub- divided in to the following divisions for convenience. Pomology: It is derived from two words i.e. 'Pomum' meaning fruit and 'Logos' meaning discourse or study. So, Pomology is study or cultivation of fruit crops. For example, mango, sapota, guava, grape, banana etc.Fruit: It is a developed and matured ovary with or without accessory parts and which is generally eaten as raw. Olericulture: It is derived from two words ie. 'Oleris' meaning Potherb and 'Cultra' meaning cultivation. So, Olericulture literally means potherb cultivation. In the present days it is introductory agricul ture3broadly used to indicate the cultivation of vegetables. For example, brinjal, okra, tomato, pumpkin etc. Vegetable: It is any part of the herbaceous plant that is generally used after cooking as a principal part of the meal. Floriculture: It is derived from two words i.e. 'Florus' meaning flower and 'Cultra' meaning cultivation. So floriculture means study of flower crops. In this there are again two sub- divisions. (1) Commercial Floriculture (2) Ornamental Floriculture. Commercial Floriculture: Deals with the cultivation of flower crops grown on commercial scale for profit (Income). For example, rose, jasmine, carnation, aster, and marigold etc. Ornamental Floriculture: It deals with the raising of flower crops for ornamental, pleasure and fashion purposes. For example, dahlia, zinnia, cosmos, etc. Arboriculture: This branch deals with the raising of perennial trees meant for shade, avenue or ornamental purposes. For example, polyalthia, spathodea, cassia, gulmohar etc. Plantation Crops: Are those crops, which are cultivated in an extensive scale in large contiguous areas, owned and managed by an individual or a company and whose produce is utilized only after processing. For example, coffee, tea, rubber, coconut, cocoa etc. Spices and Condiments: This branch deals with the cultivation of crops whose produce is used mainly for seasoning and flavouring dishes. Spices are those plants, the products of which are made use of as food adjuncts to add aroma and flavour. For example, pepper, cardamom, clove, cinnamon, All spice etc. Condiments are those plants, the products of which are made use of as food adjuncts to add taste only. For example, turmeric, ginger, red chillies, onion, garlic etc. Both spices and condiments contain essential oils, which provide aroma, flavour and taste and they are of little nutritive value. Medicinal and Aromatic Plants: It deals with the cultivation of medicinal plants, which provide drugs and aromatic crops which yields aromatic (essential) oils. Medicinal Plants: are those plants, which are rich in secondary metabolites and are potential sources of drugs. The secondary metabolites include alkaloids, glycosides, coumarins, flavonoides etc. Aromatic Plants: are those plants, which possesses essential oils in them. The essential oils are the odoriferous steam volatile constituents of aromatic plants. For example, lemon grass, citronella, palmrosa, vetiver, geranium, davanam, lavendor etc. 4Post Harvest Technology: It deals with the processing and preservation of produce of horticulture crops. Landscape Gardening: It deals with the planning and execution of ornamental gardens, parks, landscape gardens etc. Nursery and Seed Production: It deals with the production of seeds and planting material of horticulture crops on commercial basis. Plants grown for aesthetic value are also included in horticulture. Though crops like potato, cowpea and several condiments are grown as field crops they are included under horticultural crops when they are grown as vegetables in small areas. Horticulture also includes the fields like mushroom cultivations which is concerned with cultivation of mushroom in a controlled and intended manner to use it for the purpose of food especially button mushroom i.e. Agaricus bisporus, which is common in cultivation in India. Agroforestry is the science dealing with land use management system of growing shrubs, trees around or among crops or pastureland. In simple words it combines agricultural and forestry technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy, system for farming. Most common plants used in the agroforestry are subabul, pongamia, jatropa etc. Forestry It deals with the large scale cultivation of perennial trees for supplying wood, timber, rubber, etc. and also raw materials for industries. Soil Science is the study of soil as a natural resource on the surface of the Earth including soil formation, classification and mapping; physical, chemical, biological, and fertility properties of soils; and these properties in relation to the use and management of soils. Sometimes terms which refer to branches of soil science, such as pedology (formation, chemistry, morphology and classification of soil) and edaphology (influence of soil on organisms, especially plants), are used as if synonymous with soil science. Soil scientists have raised concerns about how to preserve soil and arable land in a world with a growing population, possible future water crisis, increasing per capita food consumption, and land degradation Agricultural Microbiology is a branch of microbiology dealing with plant-associated microbes and plant and animal diseases. It also deals with the microbiology of soil fertility, such as microbial degradation of organic matter and soil nutrient transformations. Agricultural Biotechnology also known as agritech, is an area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including genetic engineering, molecular markers, molecular diagnostics, vaccines, and tissue culture, to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and microorganisms. Agricultural Engineering is the engineering discipline that applies engineering science and technology to agricultural production and processing. Agricultural engineering combines introductory agricul ture5the disciplines of mechanical, civil, electrical and chemical engineering principles with a knowledge of agricultural principles. Agricultural Extension is a general term meaning the application of scientific research and new knowledge to agricultural practices through farmer education. The field of 'extension' now encompasses a wider range of communication and learning activities organized for rural people by educators from different disciplines, including agriculture, agricultural marketing, health, and business studies. Extension practitioners can be found throughout the world, usually working for government agencies. They are represented by several professional organizations, networks and extension journals. Agricultural Economics: It is an applied field of economics concerned with the application of economic theory in optimizing the production and distribution of food and fibre \u2014 a discipline known as agronomics. Agronomics was a branch of economics that specifically dealt with land usage. It focused on maximizing the crop yield while maintaining a good soil ecosystem. Throughout the 20 th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much broader. Agricultural economics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with conventional economics. Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in economics, econometrics, development economics, and environmental economics. Agricultural economics influences food policy, agricultural policy, and environmental policy. Human dependency on animals similarly completed by the field of animal husbandry which deals with the management and care of farm along with dealing at genetic qualities and behaviour for fulfilling the livestock needs of the society. Dairying: The human need for milk is taken care by the field of dairying which refers to long- term availability and production of milk, which is processed further for eventual meeting the need of milk of the society. Some of the most common named cow breeds for milk in India are Gir, Red Sindhi, Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Rath etc... Poultry is the branch of agriculture which deals with the rearing birds kept for meeting the food demand getting the eggs they produce, their meat, their feathers. In India some of the reared poultry breeds Piggery is the field which concerns the farm rearing and breeding pigs for the livestock purpose, Pigs convert inedible feeds, forages, certain grain byproducts obtained from mills, meat by products, damaged feeds and garbage into valuable nutritious meat. Most of these feeds are either not edible or not very palatable to human beings. Some of the pig breeds reared in India are Large white Yorkshire, Land race, Middle white Yorkshire, Hampshire, Duroc etc. Apiculture or Beekeeping denotes the rearing and maintenance of honey bee colonies, commonly in natural and artificial hives for the purpose of getting honey and bee products. 6Bee species like Apis florea, Apis dorsata ,Apis mellifera are commonly known for rearing , in all these Apis mellifera is most commonly reared species. Sericulture is a branch of agriculture dealing with the silk farming, that is rearing of silkworms for the production of silk, especially the species Bombyx mori L., which is commercially used in Indian regions like Assam, Meghalaya, that are of prime importance in the field of sericulture. Agriculture Entomology is the branch dealing with study of agriculturally important insects and pest, While, Soil Microbiology deals with soil property and health, water management plans such as irrigation and water use systems are also equally important for the holistic development of agriculture. Nematology is the scientific discipline concerned with the study of nematodes, or roundworms. Although nematological investigation dates back to the days of Aristotle or even earlier, nematology as an independent discipline has its recognizable beginnings in the mid to late 19th century Plant Pathology (also Phytopathology) is the scientific study of diseases in plants caused by pathogens (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions (physiological factors). Organisms that cause infectious disease include fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms, phytoplasmas, protozoa, nematodes and plants. Not included are ectoparasites like insects, mites, vertebrate, or other pests that affect plant health by consumption of plant tissues. Plant pathology also involves the study of pathogen identification, disease etiology, disease cycles, economic impact, plant disease epidemiology, plant disease resistance, how plant diseases affect humans and animals, pathosystem genetics, and management of plant diseases. Animal Husbandry: Maintenance of various types of livestock for direct energy (work energy), milk and meat. Husbandry is for direct and indirect energy. Fishery Science : It is for marine fish and inland fishes including shrimps and prawns.Home Science : Application and utilization of agricultural produces in a better manner.ChECK YOUR PROGRESSQ.1 Define Agriculture and mention various disciplines of agriculture?

Women by their intrinsic insight first observed that plants come up from seeds. Men concentrated on hunting and gathering (Paleolithic and Neolithic periods) during that time. Women were the pioneers for cultivating useful plants from the wild flora. They dug out edible roots and rhizomes and buried the small ones for subsequent harvests. They used animal meat as main food and their skin for clothing.

India is endowed with tropical climate with abundant solar energy throughout the year, which favours growing crops round the year. There is a vast scope to increase irrigation potential by river projects and minor irrigation projects. In additional to the above, India is blessed with more labourer availability. Since agriculture is the primary sector, other sectors are dependent on agriculture. Total geographical area 328.848 million ha. Area under cultivation 143.000 million ha. Total cropped area 179.750 million ha. Area not available for cultivation 161.300 million ha. Area under forest 66.400 million ha. Role of Agriculture in Indian Economy Indian agriculture shares nearly 14 % to the national G.D.P . and provides employment to 58% population of India directly and indirectly, it also shares nearly 10% of total export from India. Indian agriculture is one of the main reasons of India being one of stable economy in the world. Thus it is impossible to imagine and see Indian economy without the eyes of Indian agriculture. Share in National Income: The contribution from agriculture has been continuously falling from 55.1% in 1950-51 to 37.6% in 1981-82 & further to 18.5% in 2006-07. But agriculture still continues to be the main sector because it provides livelihood to a majority of the people. Largest Employment Providing Sector: 69.5% of the working population was engaged in agriculture. Provides Food to the Growing Population: Provides healthy, nutritious food to the ever growing population. Contribution to Capital Formation: Agriculture can play a big role in pushing the Capital Formation in India. Providing Raw Material to Industries: Agriculture provides raw materials to various industries of national importance. Sugar industry, Jute industry, Cotton textile industry, Vanaspati industry are examples of some such industries which depend on agriculture for their development.introductory agricul ture11 Market for Industrial Products: Since more than two-thirds of the population of India lives in rural areas, increased rural purchasing power is a valuable stimulus to industrial development. Importance in International Trade: Agriculture constitutes about 75% of the total exports of the country. Major problems faced by Indian Agriculture 1. Stagnation in Production of Major Crops 2. High cost of Farm Inputs 3. Soil Exhaustion 4. Depletion of Fresh Ground Water 5. Adverse impact of Global Climatic Change 6. Impact of Globalisation Regional Importance of different Agricultural Enterprises in India' Agricultural Enterprises' has been defined as the one of those engaged in live stock production, agricultural services, hunting, trapping, game propagation, forestry logging and fishing. The agricultural enterprises account for major economic activities in our country. Due to availability of vast variable climate and land resources, our country offers us the great benefit of completely different agricultural enterprises based on the availability and specificity of the resources available in various regions. Among various agricultural enterprises available, most of the Indian citizens are involved in farming and live stock production. In South India, the major agricultural enterprises include cultivation of arable crops like paddy, maize, etc. and horticultural crops like mango, banana, guava, coconut, cashew, coffee, tea, cocoa etc. in major parts of the states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala etc. In addition to cultivation, the processing and value addition has also become a good remunerative enterprise for the farmers of these states. For example, Mango pulp processing in Chittor (AP) and Krishnagiri (TN) districts, Cashew processing in Puttur and Shimoga districts of Karnataka, Raisin making in the Bijapur region of Karnataka. Sericulture is a major enterprise in the Karnataka regions such as kolar, Bangalore (Rural & Urban), Ramnagar, Tumkur and Chikka ballapur. Poultry is one of the major enterprise in some regions of AP , Tamil Nadu and Telangana. Spices related enterprises are concentrated in various parts of kerala, Rubber enterprises are present in Kerala and Karnataka regions. Tobacco related enterprise located in and around Rajahmundry region of Andhra Pradesh. In Central India, the major enterprises include cultivation and processing of various horticultural commodities such as grapes, banana, pomegranate, onion etc. The major grape exporting and wine making enterprises are established in the regions around Nashik, 12Aurangabad and Pune while some regions of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra has the sheep enterprises. In North India, the major enterprises include cultivation of temperate fruit crops such as apple, pear, peach, plum, cherry, and nut crops such as walnut, almond etc. These enterprises are located mostly in the districts of Himachal Pradesh such as Shimla, Kinnaur etc. The saffron related enterprises were concentrated in various regions around Jammu & Kashmir, While Basmati enterprises are located in and around Punjab. In Western India, the major enterprises include Dairy enterprise along with all other agricultural enterprises. Dairy Farming is generally a type of subsistence farming system in India, especially in Gujarat, the major producer of milk in the country. More than 40% of Indian farming households are engaged in milk production because it is a livestock enterprise in which they can engage with relative ease to improve their livelihoods. Regular milk sales allow them to move from subsistence to earning a market-based income. Rice production is one of the major enterprises in western India. In Eastern and North-Eastern regions of India, the major enterprises include Tea cultivation and Processing, Fish culture, Pineapple cultivation and processing. Assam and Darjeeling Tea have became world famous, they have got GI tags and earn huge export revenue. West Bengal have the best fish and jute enterprises in India. Also, the north east region has the special advantage of bamboo enterprises and other natural resource enterprises which need to be explored further. Thus the regional enterprises have both resource and religion acceptance giving more benefits to the concerned farmers. ChECK YOUR POROGRESS Q.1 Discuss briefly the history of Indian agriculture.

It is a measure of the average pattern of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric pressure and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. The climatic factors include rainfall and water, light, temperature, relative humidity, air, and wind. They are abiotic components, including topography and soil, of the environmental factors that influence plant growth and development. Influence of Climate on Crops Climate is the most important dominating factor influencing the suitability of a crop to a particular region. The yield potential of the crop mainly depends on climate. More than 50 per cent of variation of crops is determined by climate. The most important climatic factors that influence growth, development and yield of crops are solar radiation (light), temperature and rainfall. Solar Radiation (Sun Light)Solar Radiation (Sun Light) is that visible portion of the solar radiation or electromagnetic spectrum. It is a form of kinetic energy that comes from the sun in tiny particles called quanta or photons, travelling in waves. Sunlight should be carefully considered when selecting plants for your garden. All plants need sunlight for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which light, chlorophyll, energy, carbon dioxide and water interact within the plant to produce the sugar and starches it needs to survive. All plants require some amount of sunlight, but introductory agricul ture15some need many hours of full sun while others do best largely in the shade. Plants need sunlight in order to survive and, without sunlight, or artificial light if grown indoors, plants would not grow strong and healthy and would die, or at best, be very unhealthy. Three properties of light affect plant growth and development are light quality, light intensity, and day length or photoperiod. Light quality refers to the specific wavelength of light; light intensity is the degree of brightness that a plant receives; and day length is the duration of the day with respect to the light period. Temperature Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of a substance is called temperature. It is commonly expressed in degree Celsius or centigrade (0C) and degree Fahrenheit (0F). Temperature influences growth processes of all plant such as photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, breaking of seed dormancy, seed germination, protein synthesis, and translocation. At high temperature the translocation of photosynthate is faster so plants tend to mature earlier. In general, plants survive within a temperature range of 0 to 50 0C. The favourable or optimal day and night temperature range for plant growth and maximum yield varies among crop species. Enzyme activity and the rate of most chemical reactions generally increase with rise in temperature. But at excessively high temperatures, denaturation of enzymes and other proteins occur. Excessively low temperature can also cause limiting effects on plant growth and development. For example, water absorption is inhibited when the soil temperature is low because water is more viscous at low temperatures and less mobile, and the protoplasm less permeable. At temperatures below the freezing point of water, there is change in form of water from liquid to solid. The expansion of water as it solidifies in living cells causes the rupture of the cell walls. Air The air is a mixture of gases in the atmosphere. About 75% of this air is found in the troposphere. The Oxygen and Carbon dioxide in the air is important to the physiology of plants. Oxygen is essential in respiration for the production of energy that is utilized in various growth and development processes. Carbon dioxide is a raw material in photosynthesis. WindAir movement or wind is due to the existence of pressure gradient on a global or local scale caused by differences in heating. On a global scale it consists of the jet stream flow and movement of large air masses. On the local scale only a smaller quantity of air moves. Surface winds are lower and less turbulent at night due to the absence of solar heating. When air that is close to the ground cools, it contracts and the pressure rises; when it warms, it expands and loses pressure. Where both cold and warm air occur in proximity, as over a 16lake and its adjacent shore, the cold flows to the direction of the warm air or from high to low pressure area to correct the pressure imbalance. This also happens in tropical Asia but in a larger and more complex way, as the monsoon winds. This climatic factor serves as a vector of pollen from one flower to another thus aiding in the process of pollination. It is therefore essential in the development of fruit and seed from wind-pollinated flowers as in many grasses. Moderate winds favor gas exchanges, but strong winds can cause excessive water loss through transpiration as well as lodging or toppling of plants. When transpiration rate exceeds that of water absorption, partial or complete closure of the stomata may ensue which will restrict the diffusion of carbon dioxide into the leaves. As a result, there will be a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis, growth and yield (Edmond et al. 1978). Each of the above discussed climatic factors has been shown to produce limiting effects on various growth processes. However, the various climatic factors always operate together and interact with each other under natural conditions. Rainfall (Precipitation)Rainfall is the most common form of precipitation. It is the falling of water in droplets on the surface of the earth from clouds. Other forms of precipitation are freezing rain, sleet or ice pellets, snowfall, and hail. The amount and regularity of rainfall vary with location and climate types and affect the dominance of certain types of vegetation as well as crop growth and yield. Relative humidity (Rh)Relative humidity (RH) is the amount of water vapor in the air, expressed as the proportion (in percent) of the maximum amount of water vapor it can hold at certain temperature. For example, an air having a relative humidity of 60% at 27 oC temperature means that every kilogram of the air contains 60% of the maximum amount of water that it can hold at that temperature. The relative humidity affects the opening and closing of the stomata which regulates loss of water from the plant through transpiration as well as photosynthesis. A substantial understanding of this climatic factor is likewise important in plant propagation. Newly collected plant cuttings and bare root seedlings are protected against dessication by enclosing them in a sealed plastic bag. The propagation chamber and plastic tent are also commonly used in propagating stem and leaf cuttings to ensure a condition with high relative humidity. SOILSoil is a mixture of broken rocks and minerals, living organisms, and decaying organic matter called humus. Humus is dark, soft and rich in nutrients. Soil also includes air and water.introductory agricul ture17Organisms in the soil need air and water to survive. Having these essential materials - air, water, and organic matter - makes it possible for plants, bacteria, fungi and small animals like earthworms and insects to live in the soil. All the living things in the soil, plus essential materials that these organisms use to survive, form the soil ecosystem. Scientists study the soil ecosystem because they want to understand how organisms relate to one another and to the environment that surrounds them. Soil generally consists of visually and texturally distinct layers, also called profiles, which can be summarized as follows from top to bottom: Figure: Photograph of Typical Soil Profile O) Organic matter: Surficial organic deposit with litter layer of plant residues in relatively non-decomposed form. A) Surface soil: Organics mixed with mineral matter. The Layer of mineral soil with the most organic matter accumulation and soil life. This layer eluviates (is depleted of) iron, clay, aluminum, organic compounds, and other soluble constituents. When eluviation is pronounced, a lighter colored \"E\" subsurface soil horizon is apparent at the base of the \" A\" horizon. A-horizons may also be the result of a combination of soil bioturbation and surface processes that winnow fine particles from biologically mounded topsoil. In this case, the A-horizon is regarded as a \"biomantle\".Bedrock)horizons18B) Subsoil: Subsurface layer reflecting chemical or physical alteration of parent material. This layer accumulates iron, clay, aluminum and organic compounds, a process referred to as illuviation. C) Parent rock: The parent material in sedimentary deposits. Layer of large unbroken rocks. This layer may accumulate the more soluble compounds . R) Bedrock: The parent material in bedrock landscapes. This layer denotes the layer of partially weathered bedrock at the base of the soil profile. Unlike the above layers, R horizons largely comprise continuous masses of hard rock that cannot be excavated by hand. Soils formed in situ will exhibit strong similarities to this bedrock layer. These areas of bedrock are under 50 feet of the other profiles. Indian Standard Soil Classification System Classification Based on Grain (Soil particle/ Soil separates) SizeThe range of particle sizes encountered in soils is very large: from boulders with dimension of over 300 mm down to clay particles that are less than 0.002 mm. Some clay contains particles less than 0.001 mm in size which behave as colloids, i.e. do not settle in water. In the Indian Standard Soil Classification System (ISSCS), soils are classified into groups according to size, and the groups are further divided into coarse, medium and fine sub-groups. The grain-size range is used as the basis for grouping soil particles into boulder, cobble, gravel, sand, silt or clay. Very coarse soils Boulder size > 300 mm Cobble size 80 - 300 mm Coarse soils Gravel size (G) Coarse 20 - 80 mm Fine 4.75 - 20 mm Sand size (S) Coarse 2 - 4.75 mm Medium 0.425 - 2 mm Fine 0.075 - 0.425 mm Fine soils Silt size (M) 0.002 - 0.075 mm Clay size (C) < 0.002 mm Gravel, sand, silt, and clay are represented by group symbols G, S, M, and C respectively. Physical weathering produces very coarse and coarse soils. Chemical weathering produce generally fine soils. Soil separates are specific ranges of particle sizes. In the United States, the smallest particles are clay particles and are classified by the USDA as having diameters of introductory agricul ture19less than 0.002 mm. The next smallest particles are silt particles and have diameters between 0.002 mm and 0.05 mm. The largest particles are sand particles and are larger than 0.05 mm in diameter. Soil TextureSoil texture is the relative proportions of sand, silt, or clay in a soil. Soil texture is a qualitative classification tool used in both the field and laboratory to determine classes for agricultural soils based on their physical texture. The classes are distinguished in the field by the \"textural feel\" which can be further clarified by separating the relative proportions of sand, silt and clay using grading sieves: The Particle Size Distribution (PSD). The class is then used to determine crop suitability and to approximate the soils responses to environmental and management conditions such as drought or calcium (lime) requirements. A qualitative rather than a quantitative tool it is a fast, simple and effective means to assess a soil's physical characteristics. Textural Triangle The soil textural class is a grouping of soils based upon these relative proportions. Soils with the finest texture are called clay soils, while soils with the coarsest texture are called sands. However, a soil that has a relatively even mixture of sand, silt, and clay and exhibits the properties from each separate is called a loam. There are different types of loams, based upon which soil separate is most abundantly present. If the percentages of clay, silt, and sand in a soil are known (primarily through laboratory analysis), you may use the textural triangle to determine the texture class of your soil. 10090 8070605040302010100908070605040302010100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 sand sandloamysandy loamloamclay siltsandy clay loam percent sandpercent silt percent loamsilty clay loamclay claysandysilty silt loam Figure: Textural Triangle. (The textural triangle describes the relative proportions of sand, silt and clay in various types of soils).20Importance of Clay and Other Particles of Similar Size Clay particles, as well as other particles of similar size, are important components of a soil. There is a fundamental difference between soils that contain large amounts of sand particles and soils that contain large amounts of very small particles, such as clay. That difference is surface area. The total surface area of a given mass of clay is more than a thousand times the total surface area of sand particles with the same mass. To put this idea into perspective, imagine a single cube with 6 sides. This cube represents a sand particle. Now, imagine that you break this single cube up into 100 smaller cubes, which represent 100 clay particles. These 100 cubes each have 6 sides. Essentially, by breaking up the larger cube, you have exposed many more surfaces. Thus, the total surface area of the smaller cubes will be much greater than the surface area of the single cube. This increase in surface area has an important implication in nutrient management because it provides many places for soil particles to retain and supply nutrients (such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate) and water for plant uptake. Types of Very Small Particles within the Soil The most common clay minerals in Maui's soil are called layered silicate clays, or phyllosilicates. There are different types of layered silicates, such as kaolinite, halloysite, montmorillonite, and vermiculite. The various types of layered silicates differ greatly, as we will discuss later. Amorphous minerals, such as allophane, imogolite, and ferrihydride , may be found in the volcanic soils of Hawaii that developed from volcanic ash. Like silicate clays, these minerals have a very high surface area. As a result, soils with amorphous minerals hold large amounts of water and stored nutrients, depending on the degree of weathering. Aluminum and iron oxides are typically found in the highly-weathered soils of the tropics. As clay minerals are intensely weathered, the structure of silicates clays change. Particularly, the silicate clays lose silica. What remains in the soil are aluminum and iron oxides. Gibbsite is an example of an aluminum oxide, which has a grayish, whitish hue. Goethite is an example of an iron oxide, which imparts a reddish color to the soil. Properties of Oxides Oxides are fairly stable and resistant to further weathering. Oxides can act like a glue and hold other soil particles together. Oxides can tie up nutrients, such as phosphorus. Oxides have a high anion exchange capacity (AEC). humus is the portion of organic matter that is mostly resistant to decomposition and remains in the soil. Humus is composed of small particles, with tremendous surface area. These particles have a very great capacity to retain and supply nutrients, as well as hold water.introductory agricul ture21Soil Structure Soil structure is the arrangement of soil particles into groupings. These groupings are called peds or aggregates, which often form distinctive shapes typically found within certain soil horizons. For example, granular soil particles are characteristic of the surface horizon. Soil aggregation is an important indicator of the workability of the soil. Soils that are well aggregated are said to have \"good soil tilth.\" The various types of soil structures are provided in Figure. Granular: Resembles cookie crumbs and is usually less than 0.5 cm in diameter. Commonly found in surface horizons where roots have been growing.Prismatic: Vertical columns of soil that might be a number of cm long. Usually found in lower horizons.Blocky: Irregular blocks that are usually 1.5 - 5.0 cm in diameter. Single Grained: Soil is broken into individual particles that do not stick together. Always accompanies a loose consistence Commonly found in sandy soils.Platy: Thin, flat plates of soil that lie horizontally. Usually found in compacted soil.Columnar: Vertical columns of soil that have a salt \"cap\" at the top. Found in soils of and climates. Figure: Types of Soil Structures in Soils Source: http://www.cst.cmich.edu/users/Franc1M/esc334/lectures/physical.htm22Soil Aggregates Generally, only the very small particles form aggregates, which includes silicate clays, volcanic ash minerals, organic matter, and oxides. There are various mechanisms of soil aggregation. Mechanisms of Soil Aggregation Soil microorganisms excrete substances that act as cementing agents and bind soil particles together. Fungi have filaments, called hyphae, which extend into the soil and tie soil particles together. Roots also excrete sugars into the soil that help bind minerals. Oxides also act as glue and join particles together. This aggregation process is very common to many highly weathered tropical soils and is especially prevalent in Hawaii. Finally, soil particles may naturally be attracted one another through electrostatic forces, much like the attraction between hair and a balloon. Aggregate Stability Stable soil aggregation is a very valuable property of productive soils. Yet, the stability of soil aggregation is very reliant on the type of minerals present in the soil. Certain clay minerals form very stable aggregates, while other clay minerals form weak aggregates that fall apart very easily. Highly weathered silicate clays, oxides, and amorphous volcanic materials tend to form the most stable aggregates. The presence of organic matter with these materials improves stable aggregate formation. In nutrient management, the aggregate stability is important because well-aggregated minerals are well drained and quite workable. In contrast, less weathered silicate clays, such as montmorillonite, form weak aggregates. Some silicate clays are said to have a shrink-swell potential. This means that the soil minerals expand, or swell, when wet, causing the soil to become sticky and drain poorly. When dry, these soils shrink and form cracks. The make-up of the lattice structure of silicate clays determines the shrink-swell potential. Although there are no soils with a shrink-swell potential in Maui, these soils may be found on Molokai. Tillage Tillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical agitation of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. Examples of human-powered tilling methods using hand tools include shoveling, picking, mattock work, hoeing, and raking. Examples of draft-animal-introductory agricul ture23powered or mechanized work include ploughing (overturning with or chiseling with chisel shanks), rototilling, rolling with cultipackers or other rollers, harrowing, and cultivating with cultivator shanks (teeth). Small-scale gardening and farming, for household food production or small business production, tends to use the smaller-scale methods above, whereas medium- to large-scale farming tends to use the larger-scale methods. There is a fluid continuum, however. Any type of gardening or farming, but especially larger-scale commercial types, may also use low-till or no-till methods as well. \"Tillage\" can also mean the land that is tilled. The word \"cultivation\" has several senses that overlap substantially with those of \"tillage\". In a general context, both can refer to agriculture. Within agriculture, both can refer to any of the kinds of soil agitation described above. Additionally, \"cultivation\" or \"cultivating\" may refer to an even narrower sense of shallow, selective secondary tillage of row crop fields that kills weeds while sparing the crop plants. Tillage is often classified into two types, primary and secondary. There is no strict boundary between them so much as a loose distinction between tillage that is deeper and more thorough (primary) and tillage that is shallower and sometimes more selective of location (secondary). Primary tillage such as ploughing tends to produce a rough surface finish, whereas secondary tillage tends to produce a smoother surface finish, such as that required to make a good seedbed for many crops. Harrowing and rototilling often combine primary and secondary tillage into one operation. It can be define as: Primary tillage loosens the soil and mixes in fertilizer and/or plant material, resulting in soil with a rough texture. Secondary tillage produces finer soil and sometimes shapes the rows, preparing the seed bed. It also provides weed control throughout the growing season during the maturation of the crop plants, unless such weed control is instead achieved with low-till or no-till methods involving herbicides. The seed bed preparation can be done with harrows (of which there are many types and subtypes), dibbles, hoes, shovels, rotary tillers, subsoilers, ridge- or bed-forming tillers, rollers, or cultivators. The weed control, to the extent that it is done via tillage, is usually achieved with cultivators or hoes, which disturb the top few centimeters of soil around the crop plants but with minimal disturbance of the crop plants themselves. The tillage kills the weeds via two mechanisms: uprooting them, burying their leaves (cutting off their photosynthesis), or a combination of both. Weed control both prevents the crop plants from being out competed by the weeds (for water and sunlight) and prevents the weeds from reaching their seed stage, thus reducing future weed population aggressiveness.24Tillage systems: There are different types of tillage systems. Reduced TillageReduced tillage leaves between 15 and 30% residue cover on the soil or 500 to 1000 pounds per acre (560 to 1100 kg/ha) of small grain residue during the critical erosion period. This may involve the use of a chisel plow, field cultivators, or other implements. Intensive Tillage Intensive tillage leaves less than 15% crop residue cover or less than 500 pounds per acre (560 kg/ha) of small grain residue. This type of tillage is often referred to as conventional tillage but as conservational tillage is now more widely used than intensive tillage (in the United States), it is often not appropriate to refer to this type of tillage as conventional. Intensive tillage often involves multiple operations with implements such as a mold board, disk, and/or chisel plow. Then a finisher with a harrow, rolling basket, and cutter can be used to prepare the seed bed. There are many variations. Conservation Tillage Conservation tillage leaves at least 30% of crop residue on the soil surface, or at least 1,000 lb/ac (1,100 kg/ha) of small grain residue on the surface during the critical soil erosion period. This slows water movement, which reduces the amount of soil erosion. Conservation tillage also benefits farmers by reducing fuel consumption and soil compaction. By reducing the number of times the farmer travels over the field, farmers realize significant savings in fuel and labor. In most years since 1997, conservation tillage was used in US cropland more than intensive or reduced tillage. However, conservation tillage delays warming of the soil due to the reduction of dark earth exposure to the warmth of the spring sun, thus delaying the planting of the next year's spring crop of corn. No-till - Never use a plow, disk, etc. ever again. Aims for 100% ground cover. Strip-till - Narrow strips are tilled where seeds will be planted, leaving the soil in between the rows untilled. Mulch-till- Soil is covered with mulch to conserve heat and moisture. Rotational Tillage - Tilling the soil every two years or less often (every other year, or every third year, etc.). Ridge-Till- Ridges are made with the help of ridge maker for sowing or planting. Effects of Tillage Positive Effects of Tillage Plowing: Loosens and aerates the top layer of soil, which facilitates planting the crop,introductory agricul ture25 Helps mix harvest residue, organic matter (humus), and nutrients evenly into the soil, Mechanically destroys weeds, Dries the soil before seeding (in wetter climates tillage aids in keeping the soil drier), When done in autumn, helps exposed soil crumble over winter through frosting and defrosting, which helps prepare a smooth surface for spring planting. Negative Effects of Tillage Dries the soil before seeding, Soil loses a lot of nutrients, like nitrogen and fertilizer, and its ability to store water, Decreases the water infiltration rate of soil. (Results in more runoff and erosion since the soil absorbs water slower than before), Tilling the soil results in dislodging the cohesiveness of the soil particles thereby inducing erosion, Chemical runoff, Reduces organic matter in the soil, Reduces microbes, earthworms, ants, etc., Destroys soil aggregates, Compaction of the soil, also known as a tillage pan, Eutrophication (nutrient runoff into a body of water), Can attract slugs, cut worms, army worms, and other harmful insects to the left over residues, Crop diseases can be harbored in surface residues. Alternatives to Tilling Modern agricultural science has greatly reduced the use of tillage. Crops can be grown for several years without any tillage through the use of herbicides to control weeds, crop varieties that tolerate packed soil, and equipment that can plant seeds or fumigate the soil without really digging it up. This practice, called no-till farming, reduces costs and environmental change by reducing soil erosion and diesel fuel usage. Researchers are investigating farming in polyculture that would eliminate the need for both tillage and pesticides, such as no-dig gardening. Erosion Soil is one of the most important natural resources of man. Soils are essential for man for growing crops, fodder and limber. Once the fertile portion of the earth's surface is lost, it is 26very difficult to replace it. In India, the destruction of the top-soil has already reached an alarming proportion. Land degradation problems have resulted in increasing depletion of the productivity of the basic land stock through nutrient deficiencies. In addition to the direct loss of crop producing capacity, soil erosion increases the destructiveness of floods and decreases the storage capacity of water in reservoirs. It is, therefore, necessary to keep soil in place and in a state favourable to its highest productive capacity. Soil Erosion The process of destruction of soil and the removal of the destroyed soil material constitute soil erosion. The vastly accelerated process of soil removal brought about by the human interference, with the normal disequilibrium between soil building and soil removal is designated as soil erosion\". Soil erosion takes place through two agencies water and air and called as water erosion and wind erosion. Types of Water Erosion Erosion of soil by water is quite significant and takes place chiefly in two ways (a) Sheet erosion, (b) Gully erosion. (a) Sheet erosionSheet movement of water causes sheet erosion and depends on the velocity and quantity of pronounced surface runoff and the erodability of the soil itself. In such cases, the soil is eroded as layers from the hill slopes, sometimes slowly and insidiously and sometimes more rapidly. Sheet erosion is more or less universal on:- all bare follow land, all uncultivated land whose plant cover has been thinned out by over grazing, fire or other misuse, and all sloping cultivated fields and on sloping forest, scrub jungles where natural porosity of soil has been removed by heavy grazing, felling of trees or burning etc. The particles loosened and shifted by the rain drops are carried down slope by a very thin sheet of water which moves along the surface. The impacts of the raindrops increases the turbulence and transporting capacity of this unchannelized sheet wash which results in the uniform skimming of the top soil. Sheet erosion is considered as dangerous as it may continue for years but may or may not leave any trace of the damage. Sheet erosion is common in the Himalayan foothills, in Assam, Western ghats and Eastern ghats.introductory agricul ture27When sheet erosion continues unchecked, the silt laden run-off forms well-defined minute finger shaped grooves over the entire field. Such thin channelling is known as 'rill-erosion', which is active over wide areas in Bihar, Uttar gentle slope, adequately covered by vegetation, clay soil will resist erosion to a great extent and the water forms small rivulets which can then erode deeper. The rivulets in turn join together to form larger channels until gullies are formed gradually deep gullies cut into the soil and then spread and grow until all the soil is removal from the sloping ground. This phenomenon once started and if not checked, goes on extending and ultimately the whole land is converted into a bad-land topography. Gully erosion is more common in areas where the river system has cut down into elevated plateaus so that feeders and branches carve out an intricate pattern of gullies. Apart from this, it also takes place in relatively level country whenever large blocks of cultivation give rise to concentration of field run-off. Wind ErosionIt occurs in dry climatic areas having a sparse and low vegetation cover on mechanically weathered, loosened surficial material. Dust storms are the principal agents of wind erosion. The top soil is often blown off from the surface rendering it infertile. Besides, with the decrease in the wind velocity coarse sand particles get deposited in some areas covering the existing soil and rendering it unproductive. Soil ConservationSoil conservation is the prevention of soil from erosion. It includes all such measures which help in protecting the soil through contour terracing and bunding, construction of bunds across gullies, leveling of uneven land and raising grass and other vegetation on land are the small measures which are usually taken by farmers to protect soil from erosion. Such methods are quite effective in areas where the degree of erosion is not serious as in the semi-arid tracts of the peninsula and part of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab. In the tropical areas, shifting cultivation known as jhumming in Assam, ponam in Kerala, podu in Orissa. Methods of Soil Conservation Contour Bunding: is the construction of small bunds across the slopes of the land on a contour. If, the ploughing is done at right angles to the hill slope. Following the natural contour of the hill, the ridges and furrows break the flow of the water down the hill. This prevents excessive soil loss, as gullies are likely to develop and also reduce run-off so plants 28receive more water. Row crops and small grains are often planted in contour pattern so that the plants can absorb much of the rain, and erosion is minimized. Terracing: Slopes may be cut into a series of terraces with sufficient level ground on each terrace for cultivation, and an outer wall at the edge to retain the soil and to slow down the flow of rain-water down the slope. Terracing is widely used in Monsoon Asia for wet paddy cultivation, as the excess water and silt can be retained at each terrace to form flooded paddy-fields. Terraces are also used in temperate and semi arid regions where slopes are steep. Terracing enables farmers in mountainous regions to utilize the steep ground on the favoured sunny slopes' of valleys for vines or other crops. Strip Cropping: Crops may be cultivated in alternate strips, parallel to one another. Some strips may be allowed to lie fallow while others are sown to different kind of crops, e.g. grains, legumes, small tree crops. The various crops ripen at different times of the year and harvested at intervals. This ensures that at no time will the entire area be left bare or exposed. The tall- growing crops act as wind breaks and the strips, which are often parallel to the contours, help to increase water absorption by the soil by slowing down run-off. Fallowing: Sometimes it is important to allow much used land to rest or lie fallow, so that the natural forces can act on the soil. The decayed natural vegetative matter helps to increase the plant nutrients in the soil. Fallowing also increases the sub-soil moisture and improves the general structure of the soil. Winter fallow is commonly practiced in temperate regions after the harvest, but cultivation is resumed in the spring after the snow and frost have weathered the top soil. Long periods of fallow cannot be allowed, however, in intensively run farms as farmers cannot afford it. Cover Cropping: In some cases, as in plantations, where the gestation period of tree crops is long, cover crops may be inter-planted between the young trees. Creepers are preferred because they spread around and form a useful cover that protects the top soil from the full force of the tropical downpours. Care must be taken that cover crop does not compete with the young trees for the essential plant nutrients, and leguminous crops are often used because they add nitrogen to the soil. Cover crops may be grown simply to protect the soil or may consist of other valuable plants such as vegetables which provide an income while the plantation crops matures. Some such crops, e.g. cotton, maize or tobacco should be avoided because they exhaust the soil or promote soil erosion instead of preventing it. Crop Rotation: It is not advisable to grow the same crop in the same field for more than two years in succession as the crop will tend to exhaust one particular kind of mineral nutrient. For example potatoes require much potash, but wheat requires nitrates. Thus, it is best to alternate crops in the fields. Legumes such as peas, beans, clover, vetch and many other plants, add nitrates to the soil by converting free nitrogen in the air into nitrogenous nodules on their roots. Thus, if they are included in the crop rotation nitrogenous fertilizers can be dispensed with. By rotating different types of crops in successive years, soil fertility can be naturally maintained. introductory agricul ture29Crop Diversification: This practice is often like crop rotation in that it helps to maintain soil fertility. Where annually-harvested crops are grown they can be alternated in the field. Where perennial crops like tree crops are grown, however, the chief importance of crop diversification to the farmer is economic. In particular it reduces the danger of depending on a single crop (monoculture). Control of Gully erosion: Gully control by the diversion of runoff proved to be an economical measure. The best method of controlling existing gullies is to re-establish vegetation. Two of the most important types are the sod strip eroded earth till. Wind Break: The principal method of reducing surface velocity of wind upon which would depend the abrasive and transportation capacity are vegetal measures. Soil Fertility and Productivity Soil Fertility: Soil fertility is the ability of the soil to provide all essential plant nutrients in available forms and in a suitable balance.Soil Productivity: The capability of soil to produce specified crop yield under well defined and specified systems of management of inputs and environmental conditions. Factors Governing Soil FertilityParent Material: Fertility of a soil depends on the chemical composition of parent material from which it derived. Soils on the upper slope are less fertile than the soils on lower slope because high leaching and erosion on upper slope. Climate: In tropical climate decomposition of organic matter is faster than temperate climate. Thus soils of tropical regions are less fertile when compared to temperate region. Depth of Soil Profile: Deep soils are more fertile than the shallow soils and the roots are spread well enough in deep soils than the shallow soils. Physical Condition of SoilThe soil texture and soil structure influence the soil fertility. Artificial Factors: i. Water logging ii. Cropping system iii. Toxic chemicals and pesticides in the soil.30Difference between Soil Fertility and Productivity: Soil Fertility Soil Productivity 1. It is an index of available nutrient to plants 1.

Soil organic matter (SOM) is mainly composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen but also has small amounts of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, potassium, calcium and magnesium contained within organic residues. It is divided into 'living' and 'dead' components and can range from very recent inputs such as stubble to largely decayed materials that are thousands of years old. Less than 15% of below-ground soil organic matter such as roots, fauna and microorganisms is 'living' (Figure). Soil organic matter also exists as four distinct fractions which vary widely in their in size, composition and turnover times in the soil (Table). 1. Dissolved organic matter 2. Particulate organic matter 3. Humus4. Resistant organic matterintroductory agricul ture31 Living organic matter Particulate residues Living organisms Humus Resistant organic matter10%10%15% 65% Figure: The vast majority of soil organic matter is dead or decaying with living organisms making up less than 15% of the soil organic matter pool Table: The size, turnover rate and composition of the four soil organic matter fractions Fraction Size micrometres (\u00b5m) & millimetres exudates, simple sugars and decomposition by-products. It generally makes up less than 5% of total soil organic matter. Particulate organic matter53\u00b5m-2mm 2-50 years Fresh or decomposing plant and animal matter with identifiable cell structure. Makes up between 2-25% of total soil organic matter. Humus <53\u00b5m Decadal (0s-00s years)Older, decayed organic compounds that have resisted decomposition. Can make up more than 50% of total soil organic matter. Resistant organic matter<53\u00b5m<2mm00s-000s yearsRelatively inert material such as chemically resistant materials or organic remnants (e.g. charcoal). Can be up to 10% of soil organic matter.32Storing the carbon contained in organic matter within the soil is seen as one way to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions (in this case carbon dioxide) but to do this an increase in the more stable or resistant fractions of organic matter is required. how is soil organic matter different to soil organic carbon?Soil organic carbon (SOC) is different to organic matter because it refers only to the carbon component of organic compounds. Soil organic matter is difficult to measure directly, so laboratories tend to measure and report soil organic carbon. A conversion factor is available to report soil organic matter when required. About 58% of the mass of organic matter exists as carbon. So if we know the organic carbon content in a soil we can estimate the amount of organic matter: Organic matter (%) = total organic carbon (%) x 1.72 While this ratio can vary in different soils, using a conversion factor of 1.72 provides a reasonable estimate of soil organic matter and is suitable for most purposes. What is humus?Before to define humus, let's look at some similar terms that add confusion to the story.humus Layer : This term is sometimes used to describe an upper level of soil - that dark black layer, such as in \"that humusy layer of soil'. Although the dark color is probably due to humus, humus is not a layer in soil. There is no such thing as a 'humus layer'. humus Soil : This term is floated around the net and it is not clear what it means. Is it soil with humus in it? Most soil has some humus so why not just call it soil? It is a term that should not be used. humus = Compost : In agriculture and gardening the term humus is sometimes used to describe well aged compost. You can buy bags of stuff labeled 'humus' at gardening centers, but this is just mislabeled compost. This is an incorrect use of the term. Compost is plant material that is slightly decomposed. Even aged, well-rotted compost is still only slightly decomposed. Once added to soil compost will continue to decompose for several years. Compost is NOT humus. Fulvic acid, humic acid and humin : These are terms referring to different sub-parts of humus. They have specific scientific definitions and should not be used in place of the word humus. From the point of view of gardeners these terms should not be used. Humification - The Process of Creating Humus The best way to understand humus is to understand how it is formed. Dead plant and animal material consists of organic matter. Organic matter is a catch all phrase used to describe a wide range of molecules including starches, proteins, sugars, carbohydrates, amino acids etc. When organic matter starts to decompose these molecules are broken down into smaller introductory agricul ture33and smaller molecules by the micro-organisms in the soil (mostly bacteria and fungi). This is a complex process. Most of the useable chemicals in the organic matter are extracted by the micro-organisms and are eventually made available to plants. At some point, all of the good stuff in the organic matter is used up and some molecules remain that can't be used by micro-organisms or plants. This remaining material is called humus. It consists mostly of carbon and so it is still organic, but micro-organisms just can decompose it any further. Humus is so stable that it can persist in the soil for hundreds of years. Humus consists of very large complex carbon based molecules. More recent research suggests that it might actually consist of smaller molecules that are conglomerated into large complex systems. Scientists still don't understand humus completely. Humus is very important for soil. The high amount of humus is good for soil. Break down of Organic Matter Organic matter break down is not a single chemical transformation but a complex process. Break down of organic matter involves chemical alteration of organic matter, physical fragmentation and finally release of mineral nutrients. Organic matter break down is a biological process because it is the soil organisms (microorganisms, earthworms, microarthropods, ants beetles etc) that perform the chemical and physical changes. Different organisms are involved with the different stages of these processes. Break down starts almost immediately after the organism, or part of it, dies. The organic material is colonised by micro-organisms that use enzymes to oxidise the organic matter to obtain energy and C. For leaves and roots their surfaces are colonised by microorganisms even before they die. Soil animals such as earthworms assist in the decompostion of organic matter by incorporating it into the soil where conditions are more favourable for deocmpostion than on the surface. Earthworms and other larger soil animals, such as mites, collembola and ants, fragment organic material increasing the surface area and allowing more microorganisms to colonise the organic matter and decompose it. During decomposition the organic molecules in organic matter are broken down into simpler organic molecules that require further decomposition or into mineralised nutrients. The compounds in organic matter vary in the ease with which microorganisms can break them down. The first organic compounds to be broken down are those that are easy to break down, including amino acids and sugars. Cellulose will break down more slowly and lignin, phenols and waxes will remain in the soil for the longest time. Why do stems and leaves decompose at different rates?Stems and leaves decompose at different rates because they are made up of different kinds of molecules that require different enzymes for their degradation. Leaves generally have more cellulose than lignin. Stems generally have more lignin than leaves. Cellulose is a simpler 34molecule which is able to be decomposed by microorganisms more quickly than lignin. Cellulose tends to be a straight, chain-like molecule. Lignin has a complex, folded structure so the enzymes cannot break up the component parts quickly. When lignin is linked within the plant cell walls with cellulose, it makes it harder to degrade the cellulose. After 10 weeks, most parts of leaves will have been degraded, but it may take about 30 weeks to degrade the same amount of stem material. Mineralisation of Organic MatterThis needs to be considered in terms of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. Mineralisation is the biological process where organic compounds in organic matter are chemically converted by the microorganisms in soil to simpler organic compounds, other organic compounds or mineralised nutrients. Bacteria and fungi are responsible for most of the mineralisation of organic matter in soils. Microorganisms release enzymes that oxidise the organic compounds in organic matter. The oxidation reaction releases energy and carbon, which micro-organisms need to live. The final end product of mineralisation is nutrients in the mineral form. Plants require nutrients to be in mineral form to take them up from soil. Therefore all nutrients in organic matter must undergo mineralisation before they can be used by again by living organisms. For example consider a protein molecule containing carbon nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. When microorganisms mineralise the protein molecule it may undergo several changes to simpler organic molecules before the carbon is converted to carbon dioxide, the nitrogen to ammonium, the phosphorus to phosphate and the sulphur to sulphate. Immobilisation of Nutrients Immobilisation of organic matter is the opposite process to mineralisation. In immobilisation, mineralised nutrients are incorporated into organic molecules within living cells. The process of immobilisation is very important because it relocates mineral nutrients into pools within the soil that have a relatively rapid turnover time, making them available to plants and preventing their loss by leaching. Plants are generally not efficient at competing with microorganisms for mineral nutrients in soil. C: N ratio of organic matter and why is it important?The C: N ratio of organic matter means the amount of carbon relative to the amount of nitrogen present. There is always more carbon than nitrogen in organic matter. It is usually written as C: N and is a single number, because it expresses how much more carbon than nitrogen there is. For example if the ratio is 20, this means that there are 20 grams of carbon for each gram of nitrogen in that kind of organic matter. If the ratio is 100, it means that there are 100 grams of carbon for each gram of nitrogen. So if the number is low it means that the amount of carbon is reasonably similar to the amount of nitrogen. If the ratio is a large number, it means that there is considerably more carbon than nitrogen. The C: N ratio does not tell us what form the carbon and nitrogen are in, just how much is there. The C: N ratio is introductory agricul ture35important because of what happens when organic matter is incorporated into soils. First, the larger organisms like mites and soil animals break it into smaller pieces. Then the fungi and bacteria start to decompose it (they secrete enzymes to break up the chemical compounds it is made of). When the enzymes have disrupted the compounds, the bacteria and fungi can use some of the parts released in this process as nutrients. For example, if the enzyme is degrading a protein, the microbe would be able to use the carbon, nitrogen and sulphur (if there is some) for its own cell wall structure and cellular contents. Excess nutrients to the requirements of the microorganisms are available for other soil organisms or plants to use. The microorganisms can access nitrogen in soil more easily than plants can, so the plants sometimes miss out. This means that if there is not enough nitrogen for all the organisms, the plants will probably be nitrogen deficient and nitrogen addition will be needed to meet the requirements of the plant. This is why incorporating organic matter into soils can change the amount of nitrogen (and other nutrients) available to plants. Incorporating organic matter that has a high C:N ratio will probably cause some nitrogen deficiency in the crops/plants, at least in the short-term. Nitrogen CycleThe nitrogen cycle is the process by which nitrogen is converted between its various chemical forms. This transformation can be carried out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the nitrogen cycle include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The majority of earth's atmosphere (78%) is nitrogen, making it the largest pool of nitrogen. However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologist because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle. Figure: Schematic representation of the flow of nitrogen through the environment.36The importance of bacteria in the cycle is immediately recognized as being a key element in the cycle, providing different forms of nitrogen compounds assimilable by higher organisms. Nitrogen is present in the environment in a wide variety of chemical forms including organic nitrogen, ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2), inorganic nitrogen gas (N2). Organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism, humus or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition. The processes of the nitrogen cycle transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by microbes, either in their effort to harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. The diagram above shows how these processes fit together to form the nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen FixationAtmospheric nitrogen must be processed, or \"fixed\", to be used by plants. Some fixation occurs in lightning strikes, but most fixations is done by free-living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs. These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which is converted by the bacteria into other organic. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found in a wide variety of bacteria and some Archaea. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two component enzyme that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups. An example of the free-living bacteria is Azotobacter. Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Rhizobium usually live in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such symbiosis. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the Haber-Bosch process, which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia. Nitrogen Assimilation Plants take nitrogen from the soil by absorption through their roots as nitrate ions, nitrite ions, or ammonium ions. Most nitrogen obtained by terrestrial animals can be traced back to the eating of plants at some stage of the food chain. Plants can absorb nitrate or nitrite from the soil via their root hairs. If nitrate is absorbed, it is first reduced to nitrite ions and then ammonium ions for incorporation into amino acids, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. In plants that have a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia, some nitrogen is assimilated in the form of ammonium ions directly from the nodules. It is now known that there is a more complex cycling of amino acids between Rhizobia bacteroids and plants. The plant provides amino acids to the bacteroids so ammonia assimilation is not required and the bacteroids pass amino acids (with the newly fixed nitrogen) back to the plant, thus forming an interdependent relationship. While many animals, fungi, and other introductory agricul ture37heterotrophic organisms obtain nitrogen by ingestion of amino acids, nucleotides and other small organic molecules, other heterotrophs (including many bacteria) are able to utilize inorganic compounds, such as ammonium as sole N sources. Utilization of various N sources is carefully regulated in all organisms. AmmonificationWhen a plant or animal dies or an animal expels waste, the initial form of nitrogen is organic. Bacteria or fungi convert the organic nitrogen within the remains back into ammonium (NH4+), a process called ammonification or mineralization. GDH: Glu Dehydrogenase: Minor in ammonium assimilation. Important in amino acid catabolism. Nitrification The conversion of ammonia to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) is performed by bacteria such as the Nitrosomonas species, which converts ammonia to nitrites (NO2). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrites into nitrates (NO3). It is important for the ammonia to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants. Due to their very high solubility and because soils are largely unable to retain anions, nitrates can enter ground water. Elevated nitrate in groundwater is a concern for drinking water use because nitrate can interfere with blood-oxygen levels in infants and cause methemoglobinemia or blue-baby syndrome. Where groundwater recharges stream flow, nitrate-enriched groundwater can contribute toeutrophication, a process that leads to high algal population and growth, especially blue-green algal populations. While not directly toxic to fish life, like ammonia, nitrate can have indirect effects on fish if it contributes to this eutrophication. Nitrogen has contributed to severe eutrophication problems in some water bodies. Since 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer has been increasingly controlled in Britain and the United States. This is occurring along the same lines as control of phosphorus fertilizer, restriction of which is normally considered essential to the recovery of eutrophied waterbodies. DenitrificationDenitrification is the reduction of nitrates back into the largely inert nitrogen gas (N 2), completing the nitrogen cycle. This process is performed by bacterial species such as 38Pseudomonas and Clostridium in anaerobic conditions. They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor in the place of oxygen during respiration. These facultatively anaerobic bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. Denitrification happens in anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The denitrifying bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants. Anaerobic Ammonia OxidationIn this biological process, nitrite and ammonia are converted directly into molecular nitrogen (N 2) gas. This process makes up a major proportion of nitrogen conversion in the oceans. Other Processes Though nitrogen fixation is the primary source of plant-available nitrogen in most ecosystems, in areas with nitrogen-rich bed rock, the breakdown of this rock also serves as a nitrogen source. Essential Plant NutrientsSixteen plant food nutrients are essential for proper crop development. Each is equally important to the plant, yet each is required in vastly different amounts. These differences have led to the grouping of these essential elements into three categories; primary (macro) nutrients, secondary nutrients, and micronutrients. PRIMARY (MACRO) NUTRIENTSPrimary (macro) nutrients are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. They are the most frequently required in a crop fertilization program. Also, they are need in the greatest total quantity by plants as fertilizer. Nitrogen: Necessary for formation of amino acids, the building blocks of protein. It is essential for plant cell division, vital for plant growth. Directly involved in photosynthesis, Necessary component of vitamins, Aids in production and use of carbohydrates and Affects energy reactions in the plant. Phosphorus: Involved in photosynthesis, respiration, energy storage and transfer, cell division, and enlargement. Promotes early root formation and growth, Improves quality of fruits, vegetables, and grains, Vital to seed formation, Helps plants survive harsh winter conditions, Increases water-use efficiency and Hastens maturity. Potassium: Carbohydrate metabolism and the break down and translocation of starches, Increases photosynthesis, Increases water-use efficiency, Essential to protein synthesis, Important in fruit formation, Activates enzymes and controls their reaction rates, Improves quality of seeds and fruit, Improves winter hardiness and Increases disease resistance.introductory agricul ture39SECONDARY NUTRIENTS The secondary nutrients are calcium, magnesium, and sulphur. For most crops, these three are needed in lesser amounts that the primary nutrients. They are growing in importance in crop fertilization programs due to more stringent clean air standards and efforts to improve the environment. Calcium: Utilized for Continuous cell division and formation, Involved in nitrogen metabolism, Reduces plant respiration, Aids translocation of photosynthesis from leaves to fruiting organs, Increases fruit set, Essential for nut development in peanuts and Stimulates microbial activity. Magnesium: Key element of chlorophyll production, Improves utilization and mobility of phosphorus, Activator and component of many plant enzymes, directly related to grass tetany, Increase iron utilization in plants and Influences earliness and uniformity of maturity. Sulphur: Integral part of amino acids, Helps develop enzymes and vitamins, Promotes nodule formation on legumes, Aids in seed production and Necessary in chlorophyll formation (though it isn't one of the constituents). MICRONUTRIENTS The micronutrients are boron, chlorine, cooper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc. These plant food elements are used in very small amounts, but they are just as important to plant development and profitable crop production as the major nutrients. Especially, they work \"behind the scene\" as activators of many plant functions. Iron: Promotes formation of chlorophyll, Acts as an oxygen carrier and Reactions involving cell division and growth. Maganese: Functions as a part of certain enzyme systems, Aids in chlorophyll synthesis andIncreases the availability of P and Ca. Zinc: Aids plant growth hormones and enzyme system, Necessary for chlorophyll production, Necessary for carbohydrate formation, and Necessary for starch formation and Aids in seed formation. Copper: Catalyzes several plant processes, Major function in photosynthesis, Major function in reproductive stages, Indirect role in chlorophyll production, Increases sugar content, Intensifies color and Improves flavor of fruits and vegetables. Molybdenum: Required to form the enzyme \"nitrate reductas\" which reduces nitrates to ammonium in plant, Aids in the formation of legume nodules and needed to convert inorganic phosphates to organic forms in the plant.40Boron: Essential of germination of pollon grains and growth of pollen tubes, Essential for seed and cell wall formation, Promotes maturity, Necessary for sugar translocation and Affects nitrogen and carbohydrate. Chlorine: Not much information about its functions, Interferes with P uptake and Enhances maturity of small grains on some soils. Plants need 16 different nutrients in order to grow, live and produce their flowers and fruits. In addition to these 13 nutrients listed above, plants require three more nutrients i.e. carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, which are extracted from air and water to make up the bulk of plant weight. They absorb the other 15 are gained through the soil. When the soil does not offer everything a plant needs you improve it by adding fertilizers, soil conditioners and lime? Fertilizer: A synthetic chemical or natural inorganic substance, either manufactured or mined and added to soil or land to increase its fertility. Manure is organic material, mostly derived from animal feces except in the case of green manure, which can be used as organic fertilizer in agriculture. Manures contribute to the fertility of the soil by adding organic matter and nutrients, such as nitrogen, that are trapped by bacteria in the soil. Higher organisms then feed on the fungi and bacteria in a chain of life that comprises the soil food web. It is also a product obtained after decomposition of organic matter like cow dung which replenishes the soil with essential elements and add humus to the soil. Difference Between Inorganic & Organic FertilizerInorganic fertilizers are classified as those fertilizers that are synthesized or mined from nonliving materials. Also known as chemical fertilizers, inorganic fertilizers are considered quick-release fertilizers; that is, the rate in which fertilizers release nutrients for the plant to absorb is relatively fast. In contrast, organic fertilizers are derived from living materials. These fertilizers are considered slow-release because it takes longer for soil microbes to release the nutrients so the plant can absorb them. Complete versus BalancedInorganic fertilizers come in single-nutrient or multinutrient formulas. Multinutrient formulas include complete and balanced fertilizers, which contain basic nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, as well as secondary and micronutrients such as calcium, magnesium, boron and manganese. The percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contained in both complete and balanced fertilizers is indicated by three numbers on the package. For example, a 5-10-5 formula is a complete fertilizer, containing 5 percent nitrogen, 10 percent phosphorus and 5 percent potassium. Balanced fertilizers are those that contain equal nutrient amounts, such as a 10-10-10 formula.introductory agricul ture41Slow-release and Specially Formulated Other types of inorganic fertilizers include slow-release formulas. These formulas contain larger molecules that are coated, helping them to break down slowly in the soil. A typical slow-release fertilizer releases nutrients over a period of 50 days to a year, reducing the chance of burning the plant or root system. Specially formulated inorganic fertilizers are those that are created for a specific type of plant. These special formulas include plant foods for azaleas, rhododendron or roses. Specially formulated fertilizers are usually highly acidic and should be used only on the plants for which they are indicated. Nitrogen FertilizersInorganic nitrogen fertilizers come in many different forms, such as ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, calcium nitrate and urea. These fertilizers contain high levels of nitrogen, one of the most vital nutrients for plant growth. However, these inorganic fertilizers tend to increase the pH of the soil upon application, increasing the chances of burn and damage to seedlings. Others pull moisture from the air, making them difficult to apply and store. Phosphorus FertilizersInorganic phosphorus fertilizers such as rock phosphate remain in the soil years after the initial application. Rock phosphate works only in acidic soils, as the nutrients do not break down for plants in neutral or alkaline soils. Superphosphates are other forms of phosphorus fertilizer. These do not affect the pH of the soil upon application, while ammonium phosphates come in water-soluble, granular forms. Potassium FertilizersInorganic potassium fertilizers include potassium sulfate and potassium nitrate, as well as muriate of potash, also known as potassium chloride. Muriate of potash is the most commonly used potassium fertilizer. In some cases, plants may be sensitive to chloride. If a plant is sensitive to chloride, potassium sulfate, also known as sulfate of potash, is a better choice, as it does not contain chloride. Potassium nitrate is easy to apply, because it does not pull moisture from the air, but it does slightly increase the pH of the soil upon application. Types of Organic FertilizersOrganic fertilizers come in the different forms. The most common organic fertilizer is animal manure. Fish emulsion, bone meal, cottonseed meal, blood meal and sludge are other forms of organic fertilizer. Advantages In the case of both kinds of fertilizers, using them in the correct amounts leads to more fertile soil. Some of the specific advantages of organic fertilizers, like sludge or manure, include improved soil texture, water retention and resistance to erosion. Inorganic fertilizers, 42however, have the potential to increase the growth rate and your plant's overall productivity more quickly. DisadvantagesWhile both kinds of fertilizers benefit the growth and life of your plants when used properly, they can also be highly detrimental to your plants when they are used improperly. For example, when formulas high in nitrogen are overused, they cause internal chemical burns and reduce the plant's environmental tolerances to temperature, drought and disease. In addition to causing your plants harm, excess nutrients can leach into the groundwater, causing levels of pollution to build over time. Biofertilizers Biofertilizers are defined as preparations containing living cells or latent cells of efficient strains of microorganisms that help crop plants' uptake of nutrients by their interactions in the rhizosphere when applied through seed or soil. They accelerate certain microbial processes in the soil which augment the extent of availability of nutrients in a form easily assimilated by plants. Very often microorganisms are not as efficient in natural surroundings as one would expect them to be and therefore artificially multiplied cultures of efficient selected microorganisms play a vital role in accelerating the microbial processes in soil. Use of biofertilizers is one of the important components of integrated nutrient management, as they are cost effective and renewable source of plant nutrients to supplement the chemical fertilizers for sustainable agriculture. Several microorganisms and their association with crop plants are being exploited in the production of biofertilizers. They can be grouped in different ways based on their nature and function. Different Types of BiofertilizersRhizobium Rhizobium is a soil habitat bacterium, which can able to colonize the legume roots and fixes the atmospheric nitrogen symbiotically. The morphology and physiology of Rhizobium will vary from free-living condition to the bacteroid of nodules. They are the most efficient biofertilizer as per the quantity of nitrogen fixed concerned. They have seven genera and highly specific to form nodule in legumes, referred as cross inoculation group. Rhizobium inoculant was first made in USA and commercialized by private enterprise in 1930s. Initially, due to absence of efficient bradyrhizobial strains in soil, soybean inoculation at that time resulted in bumper crops but incessant inoculation during the last four decades by US farmers has resulted in the buildup of a plethora of inefficient strains in soil whose replacement by efficient strains of bradyrhizobia has become an insurmountable problem. introductory agricul ture43Azotobacter Of the several species of Azotobacter, A. chroococcum happens to be the dominant inhabitant in arable soils capable of fixing N2 (2-15 mg N2 fixed /g of carbon source) in culture media. The bacterium produces abundant slime which helps in soil aggregation. The numbers of A. chroococcum in Indian soils rarely exceeds 105/g soil due to lack of organic matter and the presence of antagonistic microorganisms in soil. Azospirillum Azospirillum lipoferum and A. brasilense (Spirillum lipoferum in earlier literature) are primary inhabitants of soil, the rhizosphere and intercellular spaces of root cortex of graminaceous plants. They perform the associative symbiotic relation with the graminaceous plants. The bacteria of Genus Azospirillum are N2 fixing organisms isolated from the root and above ground parts of a variety of crop plants. They are Gram negative, Vibrio or Spirillum having abundant accumulation of polybetahydroxybutyrate (70 %) in cytoplasm. Five species of Azospirillum have been described to date A. brasilense, A.lipoferum, A.amazonense, A.halopraeferens and A.irakense. The organism proliferates under anaerobic and aerobic conditions but it is preferentially micro-aerophilic in the presence or absence of combined nitrogen in the medium. Apart from nitrogen fixation, growth promoting substance production (IAA), disease resistance and drought tolerance are some of the additional benefits due to Azospirillum inoculation. CyanobacteriaBoth free-living as well as symbiotic cyanobacteria (blue green algae) have been harnessed in rice cultivation in India. A composite culture of BGA having heterocystous Nostoc, Anabaena, Aulosira etc. is given as primary inoculum in trays, polythene lined pots and later mass multiplied in the field for application as soil based flakes to the rice growing field at the rate of 10 kg/ha. The final product is not free from extraneous contaminants and not very often monitored for checking the presence of desiredalgal flora. Once so much publicized as a biofertilizer for the rice crop, it has not presently attracted the attention of rice 44growers all over India except pockets in the Southern States, notably Tamil Nadu. The benefits due to algalization could be to the extent of 20-30 kg N/ha under ideal conditions but the labour oriented methodology for the preparation of BGA biofertilizer is in itself a limitation. Quality control measures are not usually followed except perhaps for random checking for the presence of desired species qualitatively. AzollaAzolla is a free-floating water fern that floats in water and fixes atmospheric nitrogen in association with nitrogen fixing blue green alga Anabaena azollae. Azolla fronds consist of sporophyte with a floating rhizome and small overlapping bi-lobed leaves and roots. Rice growing areas in South East Asia and other third World countries have recently been evincing increased interest in the use of the symbiotic N2 fixing water fern Azolla either as an alternate nitrogen sources or as a supplement to commercial nitrogen fertilizers. Azolla is used as biofertilizer for wetland rice and it is known to contribute 40-60 kg N/ha per rice crop. Phosphate Solubilizing Microorganisms (PSM) Several soil bacteria and fungi, notably species of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Penicillium, Aspergillus etc. secrete organic acids and lower the pH in their vicinity to bring about dissolution of bound phosphates in soil. Increased yields of wheat and potato were demonstrated due to inoculation of peat based cultures of Bacillus polymyxa and Pseudomonas striata. Currently, phosphate solubilizers are manufactured by agricultural universities and some private enterprises and sold to farmers through governmental agencies. These appear to be no check on either the quality of the inoculants marketed in India or the establishment of the desired organisms in the rhizosphere. AM fungiThe transfer of nutrients mainly phosphorus and also zinc and sulphur from the soil milleu to the cells of the root cortex is possess vesicles for storage of nutrients and arbuscles for funneling these nutrients into the root system. By far, the commonest genus appears to be Glomus, which has several species distributed in soil. Availability for pure cultures of AM (Arbuscular Mycorrhiza) fungi is an impediment in large scale production despite the fact that beneficial effects of AM fungal inoculation to plants have been repeatedly introductory agricul ture45shown under experimental conditions in the laboratory especially in conjunction with other nitrogen fixers. Silicate Solubilizing Bacteria (SSB)Microorganisms are capable of degrading silicates and aluminum silicates. During the metabolism of microbes several organic acids are produced and these have a dual role in silicate weathering. They supply H+ ions to the medium and promote hydrolysis and the organic acids like citric, oxalic acid, Keto acids and hydroxy carbolic acids which from complexes with cations, promote their removal and retention in the medium in a dissolved state. The studies conducted with a Bacillus sp. isolated from the soil of granite crusher yard showed that the bacterium is capable of dissolving several silicate minerals underin vitro condition. The examination of anthrpogenic materials like cement, agro inputs like super phosphate and rock phosphate exhibited silicate solubilizing bacteria to a varying degree. The bacterial isolates made from different locations had varying degree of silicate solubilizing potential. Soil inoculation studies with selected isolate with red soil, clay soil, sand and hilly soil showed that the organisms multiplied in all types of soil and released more of silica and the available silica increased in soil and water. Rice responded well to application of organic sliceous residue like rice straw, rice husk and black ash @ 5 t/ha. Combining SSB with these residues further resulted in increased plant growth and grain yield. This enhancement is due to increased dissolution of silica and nutrients from the soil. Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) The group of bacteria that colonize roots or rhizosphere soil and beneficial to crops are referred to as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). The PGPR inoculants currently commercialized that seem to promote growth through at least one mechanism; suppression of plant disease (termed Bioprotectants), improved nutrient acquisition (termed Biofertilizers), or phytohormone production (termed Biostimulants). Species of Pseudomonas and Bacillus can produce as yet not well characterized phytohormones or growth regulators that cause crops to have greater amounts of fine roots which have the effect of increasing the absorptive surface of plant roots for uptake of water and nutrients. These PGPR are referred to as Biostimulants and the phytohormones they produce include indole-acetic acid, cytokinins, gibberellins and inhibitors of ethylene production. Recent advances in molecular techniques also are encouraging in that tools are becoming available to determine the mechanism by which crop performance is improved using PGPR and track survival and activity of PGPR organisms in soil and roots. The science of PGPR is at the stage where genetically modified PGPR can be produced. PGPR with antibiotic, phytohormone and siderophore production can be made. Despite of promising results, biofertilizers has not got widespread application in agriculture mainly because of the variable response of plant species or genotypes to inoculation 46depending on the bacterial strain used. Differential rhizosphere effect of crops in harbouring a target strain or even the modulation of the bacterial nitrogen fixing and phosphate solubilizing capacity by specific root exudates may account for the observed differences. On the other hand, good competitive ability and high saprophytic competence are the major factors determining the success of a bacterial strain as an inoculant. Studies to know the synergistic activities and persistence of specific microbial populations in complex environments, such as the rhizosphere, should be addressed in order to obtain efficient inoculants. In this regards, research efforts are made at Agricultural College and Research Institute, Madurai to obtain appropriate formulations of microbial inoculants incorporating nitrogen fixing, phosphate- and silicate- solubilizing bacteria and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria which will help in promoting the use of such beneficial bacteria in sustainable agriculture. Liquid Biofertilizers Biofertilizers are such as Rhizobium, Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria provide nitrogen and phosphorous nutrients to crop plants through nitrogen fixation and phosphorous solubilization processes. These Biofertilizers could be effectively utilized for rice, pulses, millets, cotton, sugarcane, vegetable and other horticulture crops. Biofertilizers is one of the prime input in organic farming not only enhances the crop growth and yield but also improves the soil health and sustain soil fertility. At present, Biofertilizers are supplied to the farmers as carrier based inoculants. As an alternative, liquid formulation technology has been developed in the Department of Agricultural Microbiology, TNAU, Coimbatore which has more advantages than the carrier inoculants. AdvantagesThe advantages of Liquid Bio-fertilizer over conventional carrier based Bio-fertilizers are listed below: Longer shelf life -12-24 months. No contamination. No loss of properties due to storage upto 45\u00ba c. Greater potentials to fight with native population. introductory agricul ture47 High populations can be maintained more than 109 cells/ml upto 12 months to 24 months. Easy identification by typical fermented smell. Cost saving on carrier material, pulverization, neutralization, sterilization, packing and transport. Quality control protocols are easy and quick. Better survival on seeds and soil. No need of running Bio-fertilizer production units through out the year. Very much easy to use by the farmer. Dosages is 10 time less than carrier based powder Bio-fertilizers. High commercial revenues. High export potential. Very high enzymatic activity since contamination is nil. Characteritistics of different Liquid Bio-fertilizers RhizobiumThis belongs to bacterial group and the classical example is symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The bacteria infect the legume root and form root nodules within which they reduce molecular nitrogen to ammonia which is reality utilized by the plant to produce valuable proteins, vitamins and other nitrogen containing compounds. The site of symbiosis is within the root nodules. It has been estimated that 40-250 kg N / ha / year is fixed by different legume crops by the microbial activities of Rhizobium. Physical features of liquid Rhizobium Dull white in colour No bad smell No foam formation, pH 6.8-7.5 Azospirllium It belongs to bacteria and is known to fix the considerable quantity of nitrogen in the range of 20- 40 kg N/ha in the rhizosphere in non- non-leguminous plants such as cereals, millets, Oilseeds, cotton etc. The efficiency of Azospirillium as a Bio-Fertilizer has increased because of its ability of inducing abundant roots in several pants like rice, millets and oilseeds even in upland conditions. Considerable quantity of nitrogen fertilizer up to 25-30 % can be saved by 48the use of Azospirillum inoculant. The genus Azospirillum has three species viz., A. lipoferum, A. brasilense and A. amazonense. These species have been commercially exploited for the use as nitrogen supplying Bio-Fertilizers. One of the characteristics of Azospirillum is its ability to reduce nitrate and denitrify. Both A. lipoferum and A. brasilense may comprise of strains which can actively or weakly denitrify or reduce nitrate to nitrite and therefore, for inoculation preparation, it is necessary to select strains which do not possess these characteristics. Azospirllium lipoferum present in the roots of some of tropical forage grasses uch as Digitaria, Panicum, Brachiaria, Maize, Sorghum, Wheat and Rye. Physical features of liquid Azospirillum The colour of the liquid may be blue or dull white. Bad odours confirms improper liquid formulation and may be concluded as mere broth. Production of yellow gummy colour materials comfirms the quality product. Acidic pH always confirms that there is no Azospirillum bacteria in the liquid. Azospirillum cultures synthesize considerable amount of biologically active substances like vitamins, nicotinic acid, indole acetic acids giberllins. All these hormones/chemicals helps the plants in better germination, early emergence, better root development. Role of Liquid Azospirillum under field conditions Stimulates growth and imparts green colour which is a characteristic of a healthy plant. Aids utilization of potash, phosphorous and other nutrients. Encourage plumpness and succulence of fruits and increase protein percentage. Sign of non functioning of Azospirillum in the field No growth promotion activity Yellowish green colour of leaves, which indicates no fixation of Nitrogen AzotobacterIt is the important and well known free living nitrogen fixing aerobic bacterium. It is used as a Bio-Fertilizer for all non leguminous plants especially rice, cotton, vegetables etc. Azotobacter cells are not present on the rhizosplane but are abundant in the rhizosphere region. The lack of organic matter in the soil is a limiting factor for the proliferation of Azotobaceter in the soil. Physical features of Liquid Azotobacter The pigmentation that is produced by Azotobacter in aged culture is melanin which is due to oxidation of tyrosine by tyrosinase an enzyme which has copper. The colour can be noted in introductory agricul ture49liquid forms. Some of the pigmentation are described below- chroococcum: Produces brown-black pigmentation inoculum. light in liquid A. Produces green fluorescent liquid green in liquid inoculum. macrocytogenes: Produces, pink pigmentation in liquid inoculum. A. insignis: Produces less, gum less, pigmentation in inoculum. A. agilies: Produces green-fluorescent pigmentation Liquid Azotobacter as a Bio-control Agent Azotobacter have been found to produce some antifungal substance which inhibits the growth of some soil fungi like Aspergillus, Fusarium, Curvularia, Alternaria, Helminthosporium, Fusarium etc. AcetobaceterThis is a sacharophillic bacteria and associate with sugarcane, sweet potato and sweet sorghum plants and fixes 30 kgs/ N/ ha year. Mainly this bacterium is commercialized for sugarcane crop. It is known to increase yield by 10-20 t/ acre and sugar content by about 10-15 percent. Effect of Liquid Acetobacter Diazotrophicus on Sugarcane In South India use of Azospirillum and Phospho-bacterium on the cash crop sugarcane is a regular practice for the past few years with a saving of nearly 20 % of chemical nitrogen and phosphate applications. Now, it has been reported that a bacteria Acetobacter diazotrophicus which is present in the sugarcane stem, leaves, soils have a capacity to fix up to 300 kgs of nitrogen. This bacteria first reported in brazil where the farmers cultivate sugarcane in very poor sub-soil fertilized with Phosphate, Potassium and micro elements alone, could produce yield for three consecutive harvests, without any nitrogen fertilizer. They have recorded yield 182- 244 tons per ha. This leads to the assumption that active nitrogen fixing bacteria has associated within the plant. Do Don't Keep Bio-fertilizers bottles away from direct heat and sunlight. Store it in cool and dry place.Don't store Bio-fertilizers bottles under heat and sunlight Sell only Bio-fertilizers bottles which contain batch number, the name of the crop on which it has to be used, the date of manufacture and expiry period.Don't sell Bio-fertilizers bottles after their expiry period is over.50If the expiry period is over, then discard it as it is not effective.Don't prick holes into the bottles or puncture them to pour the content Keep Bio-fertilizers bottles away from fertilizer or pesticide containers and they should not be mixed directly.Do not mix the Bio-fertilizers with fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, herbicides and chemical fertilizers. Liquid Bio-fertilizer Application Methodology There are three ways of using Liquid Bio-fertilizers1. Seed treatment 2. Root dipping 3. Soil application Seed Treatment Seed Treatment is a most common method adopted for all types of inoculants. The seed treatment is effective and economic. For small quantity of seeds (up to 5 kgs quantity) the coating can done in a plastic bag. For this purpose, a plastic bag having size (21\" x 10\") or big size can be used. The bag should be filled with 2 kg or more of seeds. The bag should be closed in such a way to trap the airs as much as possible. The bag should be squeezed for 2 minutes or more until all the seed are uniformly wetted. Then bag is opened, inflated again and shaked gently. Stop shaking after each seeds gets a uniform layer of culture coating. The bag is opened and the seed is dried under the shade for 20-30 minutes. For large amount of seeds coating can be done in a bucket and inoculant can be mixed directly with hand. Seed Treatment with Rhizobium, Azotobacter, Azospirillum, along with PSM can be done. The seed treatment can be done with any of two or more bacteria. There is no side (antagonistic) effect. The important things that has to be kept in mind are that the seeds must be coated first with Rhizobium, Azotobacter or Azospirillum. When each seed get a layer of above bacteria then PSM inoculant has to be coated as outer layer. This method will provide maximum number of each bacteria required for better results. Treatments of seed with any two bacteria will not provide maximum number of bacteria on individual seed. Root DippingFor application of Azospirillum /PSM on paddy transplating/vegetable crops this method is used. The required quantity of Azospirillum /PSM has to be mixed with 5-10 litres of water at one corner of the field and the roots of seedlings has to be dipped for a minimum of half-an- hour before transplantation. Soil Application Use 200ml of PSM per acre. Mix PSM with 400 to 600 kgs of Cow dung FYM along with \u00bd introductory agricul ture51bag of rock phosphate if available. The mixture of PSM, cow dung and rock phosphate have to be kept under any tree or under shade for overnight and maintain 50% moisture. Use the mixture as soil application in rows or during leveling of soil. AzollaAzolla is a free-floating water fern that floats in water and fixes atmospheric nitrogen in association with nitrogen fixing blue green alga Anabaena azollae. Azolla fronds consist of sporophyte with a floating rhizome and small overlapping bi-lobed leaves and roots. Rice growing areas in South East Asia and other third World countries have recently been evincing increased interest in the use of the symbiotic N2 fixing water fern Azolla either as an alternate nitrogen sources or as a supplement to commercial nitrogen fertilizers. Azolla is used as biofertilizer for wetland rice and it is known to contribute 40-60 kg N ha-1 per rice crop. The agronomic potential of Azolla is quite significant particularly for rice crop and it is widely used as biofertilizer for increasing rice yields. Rice crop response studies with Azolla biofertilizer in the People's Republic in China and in Vietnam have provided good evidence that Azolla incorporation into the soil as a green manure crop is one of the most effective ways of providing nitrogen source for rice. The utilization of Azolla as dual crop with wetland rice is gaining importance in Philippines, Thailand, Srilanka and India. The important factor in using Azolla as a biofertilizer for rice crop is its quick decomposition in soil and efficient availability of its nitrogen to rice. In tropical rice soils the applied Azolla mineralizes rapidly and its nitrogen is available to the rice crop in very short period. The common species of Azolla are A. microphylla, A. filiculoides, A. pinnata, A. caroliniana, A. nilotica, A. rubra and A. mexicana. Method of Inoculation of Azolla to Rice Crop The Azolla biofertilizer may be applied in two ways for the wetland paddy. In the first method, fresh Azolla biomass is inoculated in the paddy field before transplanting and incorporated as green manure. This method requires huge quantity of fresh Azolla . In the other method, Azolla may be inoculated after transplanting rice and grown as dual culture with rice and incorporated subsequently.A. Azolla biomass incorporation as green manure for rice crop Collect the fresh Azolla biomass from the Azolla nursery plot. Prepare the wetland well and maintain water just enough for easy incorporation. Apply fresh Azolla biomass (15 t ha-1) to the main field and incorporate the Azolla by using implements or tractor. B. Azolla inoculation as dual crop for rice Select a transplanted rice field.52 Collect fresh Azolla inoculum from Azolla nursery. Broadcast the fresh Azolla in the transplanted rice field on 7th day after planting (500 kg/ha). Maintain water level at 5-7.5cm. Note the growth of Azolla mat four weeks after transplanting and incorporate the Azolla biomass by using implements or tranctor or during inter-cultivation practices. A second bloom of Azolla will develop 8 weeks after transplanting which may be incorporated again. By the two incorporations, 20-25 tonnes of Azolla can be incorporated in one hectare rice field. Integrated Nutrient Management Integrated Nutrient Management refers to the maintenance of soil fertility and of plant nutrient supply at an optimum level for sustaining the desired productivity through optimization of the benefits from all possible sources of organic, inorganic and biological components in an integrated manner. Integrated Nutrient Management concept has three components 1. Regulated nutrient supply for optimum crop growth and higher productivity. 2. Improvement and maintenance of soil fertility. 3. Zero adverse impact on agro - ecosystem quality by balanced fertilization of organic manures, inorganic fertilizers and bio- inoculant. Integrated Nutrient Management determinants are: 1. Nutrient requirement of cropping system as a whole. 2. Soil fertility status and special management needs to overcome soil problems, if any 3. Local availability of nutrients resources (organic, inorganic and biological sources) 4. Economic conditions of farmers and profitability of proposed INM option. 5. Social acceptability. 6. Ecological considerations. 7. Impact on the environment. Advantages of Integrated Nutrient Management1. Enhances the availability of applied as well as native soil nutrients. 2. Synchronizes the nutrient demand of the crop with nutrient supply from native and introductory agricul ture53applied sources. 3. Provides balanced nutrition to crops and minimizes the antagonistic effects resulting from hidden deficiencies and nutrient imbalance. 4. Improves and sustains the physical, chemical and biological functioning of soil. 5. Minimizes the deterioration of soil, water and ecosystem by promoting carbon sequestration, reducing nutrient losses to ground and surface water bodies and to atmosphere.

Classification based on Photosynthesis' (Reduction of CO2/Dark reaction)1. C3 Plants: Photo respiration is high in these plants C3 Plants have lower water use efficiency. The initial product of C assimilation in the three 'C' compounds. The enzyme involved in the primary carboxylation is ribulose-1,-Biophospate carboxylose. e.g. Rice, soybeans, wheat, barley cottons, potato. 2. C4 plants: The primary product of C fixation is four carbon compounds which may be malice acid or acerbic acid. The enzymes responsible for carboxylation are phosphoenol Pyruvic acid carboxylose which has high affinity for CO 2 and capable of assimilation CO2 event at lower concentration, photorespiration is negligible. Photosynthetic rates are higher in C4 than C3 plants for the same amount of stomatal opening. These are said to be drought resistant & they are able to grow better even under moisture stress. C 4 plants translate photosynthates rapidly. e.g. Sorghum, Maize, napter grass, sesame etc. 3. Cam plants: (Cassulacean acid metabolism plants) the stomata open at night and large amount of CO 2 is fixed as a malice acid which is stored in vacuoles. During day stomata are closed. There is no possibility of CO2 entry. CO2 which is stored as malice acid is broken down & released as CO2. In these plants there is negligible transpiration. C4 & cam plant have high water use efficiency. These are highly drought resistant. E.g. Pineapple, sisal & agave. Classification based on Length of Photoperiod required for Floral Initiation: Most plants are influenced by relative length of the day & night, especially for floral initiation, the effect on plant is known as photoperiodism depending on the length of photoperiod required for floral ignition, plants are classified as: 1. Short-day plants: Flower initiation takes plate when days are short less then ten hours. e.g. Rice, Jowar, green gram, black gram etc. 2. Long day's plants: Require long days are more than ten hours for floral ignition. e.g. Wheat, Barley, 3. Day neutral plants: Photoperiod does not have much influence for phase change for introductory agricul ture57these plants. e.g. Cotton, sunflower. The rate of the flowering initiation depends on how short or long is photoperiod. Shorter the days, more rapid initiation of flowering in short days plants. Longer the days more rapid are the initiation of flowering in long days plants.

Plants are grouped by various common characteristics to help us communicate similar ecological adaptations and cultural requirements. For example, the introductory agricul ture59term \"shade plants\" indicates plants tolerant to various levels of shade. \"Xeric\" groups those plants requiring less supplemental irrigation in our climate. It is important to point out that any classification system will have plants that don't exactly fit the groupings. The following are examples of some common classifications used in horticulture.Classification by Use I. Edibles A. Fruits 1) Tree fruits 2) Small fruits B.

Flowering gift plants B. Foliage plants60System of Farming A system is defined as a set of components that are interrelated and interact among themselves. A cropping system refers to a set of crop systems, making up the cropping activities of a farm system. Cropping system comprises all components required for the production of a particular crop and the interrelationships between them and environment. In other words, a cropping system usually refers to a combination of crops in time and space. Combination in time occurs when crops occupy different growing period and combinations in space occur when crops are inter planted. When annual crops are considered, a cropping system usually means the combination of crops within a given year. Cropping Pattern The yearly sequence and spatial arrangement of crops or of crops and fallow on a given area. Cropping System The cropping patterns used on a farm and their interaction with farm resources, other farm enterprises, and available technology which determine their makeup. INTENSIVE CROPPING Principles The turnaround period between one crop and another is minimized through modified land preparation. It is possible when the resources are available in plenty. Ex. Garden land cultivation. Cropping intensity is higher in intensive cropping system. Crop intensification technique includes intercropping, relay cropping, sequential cropping, ratoon cropping, etc. All such systems come under the general term multiple cropping. Need for Intensive Cropping Cropping systems has to be evolved based on climate, soil and water availability for efficient use of available natural resources. The increase in population has put pressure on land to increase productivity per unit area, unit time and for unit resource used. This cropping system should provide enough food for the family, fodder for cattle and generate sufficient cash income for domestic and cultivation expenses. Intensive Cropping: Growing number of crops on the same piece of land during the given period of time. Cropping Intensity: Number of crops cultivated in a piece of land per annum is cropping intensity. In Punjab and Tamil Nadu, the cropping intensity is more than 100% (i.e. around 140-150%). In Rajasthan, the cropping intensity is less.introductory agricul ture61Multiple Cropping: The intensification of cropping in time and space dimensions. Growing two or more crops on the same field in a year. Forms of multiple cropping Intercropping: Growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same field. Crop intensification is in both time and space dimensions. There is intercrop competition during all or part of crop growth. (a) Mixed Intercropping: Growing two or more crops simultaneously with no distinct row arrangement. Also referred to as mixed cropping. Ex: Sorghum, pearl millet and cowpea are mixed and broadcasted in rainfed conditions. (b) Row Intercropping: Growing two or more crops simultaneously where one or more crops are planted in rows. Often simply referred to as intercropping. Maize + greengram (1:1), Maize Rredgram (6:1). (c) Strip Intercropping: Growing two or more crops simultaneously in strips wide enough to permit independent cultivation but narrow enough for the crops to interact agronomically. Ex. Groundnut + redgram (6:4) strip. (d) Relay Intercropping: Growing two or more crops simultaneously during the part of the life cycle of each. A second crop is planted after the first crop has reached its reproductive stage of growth, but, before it is ready for harvest. Often simply referred to as relay cropping. Rice- rice fallow pulse. Advantages of Intercropping Better use of growth resources including light, nutrients and water. Suppression of weeds. Yield stability; even if one crop fails due to unforeseen situations, another crop will yield and gives income. Successful intercropping gives higher equivalent yields (yield of base crop + yield of intercrop), higher cropping intensity. Reduced pest and disease incidences. Improvement of soil health and agro-eco system. Sequential Cropping: Growing two or more crops in sequence on the same field in a farming year. The succeeding crop is planted after the preceding crop has been harvested. Crop intensification is only in time dimension. There is no intercrop competition. 62(a) Double, Triple and Quadruple Cropping: Growing two, three and four crops, respectively, on the same land in a year in sequence. Ex. Double Cropping: The cultivation of crop re-growth after harvest, although not necessarily for grain. Ex. Sugarcane: ratoon; Sorghum: ratoon (for fodder). The various terms defined above bring out essentially two underlying principles, that of growing crops simultaneously in mixture, i.e., intercropping; and of growing individual crops in sequence, i.e., sequential cropping. The cropping system for a region or farm may comprise either or both of these two principles. SUST AINABLE AGRICUL TURE DefinitionA farming systems that are \"capable of maintaining their productivity and usefulness to society indefinitely and must be resource-conserving, socially supportive, commercially competitive, and environmentally sound.\" satisfy human food and fiber needs; enhance environmental quality and the natural resource based upon which the agricultural economy depends; make the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources and on-farm resources and integrate, where appropriate, natural biological cycles and controls; sustain the economic viability of farm operations; enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole. Advantages of Sustainable Agriculture Production cost is low Overall risk of the farmer is reduced Pollution of water is avoided Very little or no pesticide residue is ensured Ensures both short and long term profitability introductory agricul ture63Disadvantages of Sustainable Agriculture Since sustainable agriculture uses least quantum of inputs, naturally the output (yield) may also be less. Major components of Sustainable Agricultural System Soil and water conservation to prevent degradation of soil productivity. Efficient use of limited irrigation water without leading to problems of soil salinity, alkalinity and high ground water table. Crop rotations that mitigate weed, disease and insect problems, increase soil productivity and minimise soil erosion. Integrated nutrient management that reduces the need for chemical fertilizers improves the soil health and minimise environmental pollution by conjunctive use of organics, in-organics and bio-fertilizers. 'Integrated pest management that reduces the need for agrochemicals by crop rotation, weather monitoring, use of resistant cultivar, planting time and biological pest control. Management system to control weed by preventive measures, tillage, timely inter cultivation and crop rotation to improve plant health. INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEM (IFS) Integration of two or more appropriate combination of enterprises like crop, dairy, piggery, fishery, poultry, beekeeping etc., for each farm according to the availability of resources to sustain and satisfy the necessities of the farmer Definition: A farming system is a collection of distinct functional units such as crop, livestock, processing, investments and marketing activities which interact because of the joint use of inputs they receive from the environment which have the common objective of satisfying the farmers' (decision makers) aims. The definition of the borders of the options depends on circumstances; often it includes not only the farm (economic enterprise) but also the household (farm - household system)\". Possible enterprises Wetland based Farming System Crop + Fish + Poultry/poultry/pigeon Crop + Fish + Mushroom 64Gardenland based Farming System Crop + Dairy + Biogas Crop + Dairy + Biogas + Sericulture Crop + Dairy + Biogas + Mushroom + Sylvi-culture Dry land based Farming System Crop + Goat + Agroforestry Crop + Goat + Agroforestry + Horticulture Advantages of Integrated Farming System Higher Productivity Profitability Sustainability Balanced food Recycling reduces pollution Money round the year Employment generation Increase input efficiency Standard of living of the farmer increased Better utilisation of land, labour, time and resources Relay Cropping Relay cropping is essentially a special version of double cropping, where the second crop is planted into the first crop before harvest, rather than waiting until after harvest as in true double-cropping. In this way, both crops share a portion of the growing season, increasing solar radiation and heat available to each. System pros and cons Relay cropping has advantages and disadvantages compared to standard cropping practices. Advantages of Relay Cropping the potential to reduce nitrate leaching (wheat acts as a scavenger crop), increase carbon sequestration, and increase income for producers.introductory agricul ture65Disadvantages Relay cropping The soybean planting process will likely stress the wheat crop and reduce yield from what would be expected of a non-disturbed crop. Likewise, wheat harvest may stress the soybean crop. The hope is that the two crops will result in greater income (and profit) than either single crop grown without disturbance. Relay cropping requires a greater level of management. Wheat must be planted during the soybean and corn harvest season and planting soybean into a standing crop is a new process to most farmers. Also, pest management and control practices must account for more crops being grown in close sequence. The system may not allow time for herbicide carry-over levels to decline and may increase the potential for insect and disease infestations if these pests have more than one host in the crop sequence. Crop Rotation Crop Rotation: It refers to recurrent succession of crops on the same piece of land either in a year or over a longer period of time. It is a process of growing different crops in succession on a piece of land in a specific period of time, with an objective to get maximum profit from least investment without impairing the soil fertility. Characteristics of Crop Rotation or Principles of Crop Rotation 1) It should be adaptable to the existing soil, climatic and economic factors. 2) The sequence of cropping adopted for any specific area should be based on proper land utilization. It should be so arranged in relation to the fields on the farm that the yields can be maintained and soil losses through erosion reduced to the minimum. 3) The rotation should contain a sufficient acreage of soil improving crops to maintain and also build up the OM content of the soil. 4) In areas where legumes can be successfully grown, the rotation should provide for a sufficient acreage of legumes to maintain the N supply of the soil. 5) The rotation should provide roughage and pasturage for the live stock kept on farm. 6) It should be so arranged as to help in the control of weeds, plant disease & insect- pests. 7) It should provide for the acreage of the most profitable cash crops adapted to the area.668) The rotation should be arranged as to make for economy in production & labour utilization exhaustive (potato, sugarcane) followed by less exhaustive crops (oilseeds & pulses). 9) The crops with tap roots should be followed by those which have fibrous root system. This helps in proper & uniform use of nutrients from the soil & roots do not compete with each other for uptake of nutrients. 10) The selection of crops should be problem and need/demand base. i) According to need of people of the area & family. ii) On slop lands alternate cropping of erosion promoting and erosion resisting crops should be adopted. iii) Under Dryland or limited irrigation, drought tolerant crops (Jowar, Bajra), in low lying & flood prone areas, water stagnation tolerant crops (Paddy, Jute) should be adopted. iv) Crops should suit to the farmer's financial conditions, soil & climatic conditions. 11) The crops of the same family should not be grown in succession because they act like alternate hosts for insect pests & disease pathogens and weeds associated with crops. 12) An ideal crop rotations is one which provide maximum employment to the family & farm labour, the machines and equipments are efficiently used so all the agril. Operations are done timely. Advantages of Crop Rotation: An ideal crop rotation has the following advantages: 1. There is an overall increase in the yield of crops due to maintenance of proper physical condition of the soil and its OM content. 2. Inclusion of crops having different feeding zones and different nutrient requirements help in maintaining a better balance of nutrients in the soil. 3. Diversification of crops reduces the risk of financial loss from unfavorable weather conditions and damage due to pests & diseases. 4. It facilitates more even distribution of labour. 5. There is regular flow of income over the year. 6. The incidence of weeds, pests and diseases is reduced and can be kept under control. 7. Proper choice of crops in rotation helps to prevent soil erosion. 8. It supplies various needs of farmer & his cattle.introductory agricul ture679. Agricultural operations can be done timely for all the crops because of less competition. 'The supervisory work also becomes easier.\". 10.

In addition, by draining or irrigating land, areas which are marginal or useless in their natural state, such as deserts or swamps can be brought into agricultural production. It should be emphasized that drainage and irrigation are interdependent. Where irrigation is used it is important also to provide drainage facilities, so that the irrigation water can be kept moving and not become stagnant. Similarly in drained areas, irrigation must be applied to prevent unwanted sea-water from seeping into the drained land. In other words a balance must be carefully maintained. IrrigationWhen a region does not have sufficient natural precipitation to meet the plants moisture requirements, an artificial supply of water is necessary. This is known as irrigation. The amount of extra water needed depends much on the type of crops grown, the prevailing temperature and humidity, the kind of soil and the physical conditions of the surrounding districts. Irrigation is one of the oldest agriculture techniques practiced by men, and has many advantages over simple reliance on natural water supplies. The supply of water by irrigation is regular and reliable, where as rainfall is often seasonal or unpredictable. In desert areas the use of irrigation allows cultivation to take place where it would not otherwise be possible. Irrigation water supplied by rivers in flood often carries much silt and clay, which adds to the soil of the fields, enhancing fertility and thus crop yields. There are different water resources for irrigation e.g.Tube well, canal, river, lakes etc. Drainage Drainage is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from an area. Many agricultural soils need drainage to improve production or to manage water supplies. In moist climates, soils may be adequate for cropping with the exception that they become waterlogged for brief periods each year, from snow melt or from heavy rains. Soils that are predominantly clay will pass water very slowly downward, meanwhile plant roots suffocate because the excessive water around the roots eliminates air movement through the soil. Other soils may have an impervious layer of mineralized soil, called a hardpan or relatively impervious rock layers may underlie shallow soils. Drainage is especially important in tree fruit production. Soils that are otherwise excellent may be waterlogged for a week of the year, which is sufficient to kill fruit trees and cost the productivity of the land until replacements can be established. In each of these cases appropriate drainage carries off temporary flushes of water to prevent damage to annual or perennial crops. Drier areas are often farmed by irrigation, and one would not consider drainage necessary. However, irrigation water always contains minerals and salts, which can be concentrated to introductory agricul ture69toxic levels by evapotranspiration. Irrigated land may need periodic flushes with excessive irrigation water and drainage to control soil salinity. Definition of Micro IrrigationIt can be defined as the application of water at low volume and frequent interval under low pressure to plant root zone. Concept of Micro Irrigation Besides the land, water also an important factor in the progress of Agriculture. In vast country like India with a geographical area of 328 million hectares less than 45% area is cultivated of this cultivated area only 35% i.e. 65 million ha gets irrigation. Since water is the limiting factor today, we must utilize it properly and maximum benefit can take as possible as India is second largest country in world according to population, 1202 million. The expansion of area under irrigation is essential for obtaining increased agriculture production required to feed India's growing population. The expansion could be done only by additional development conservation and efficient management of the available water resources i.e. use of micro-irrigation means application of optimum water according to plant requirement. This could be achieved by introducing advanced and sophisticated methods of irrigation viz. drip irrigation, sprinkler, etc. Drip IrrigationIt is termed as trickle irrigation also and can be define as slow and frequent application of water to the plant root zone under low pressure. The drip irrigation is an advanced method of irrigation suitable for water scarcity areas. It uses the water very economically and efficient. It applies the correct quantity of water to the plant at the root zone through a network of tubing's. The design of drip system is simple. These requirements are pipes, accessories and other equipment. This method can be very well adopted for wide spaced crops like Coconut, Mango, Sapota, Banana, etc A drip irrigation system consists essentially of mainline, sub mains, lateral, drippers, filters and other small fittings and accessories like valves, pressure regulators, pressure gauge, fertilizer application components etc. Advantages of Drip Irrigation Maximum use of available water. No water being available to weeds. Maximum crop yield. High efficiency in the use of fertilizers. Less weed growth and restricts population of potential hosts. 70 Low labour and relatively low operation cost. No soil erosion. Improved infiltration in soil of low intake. Ready adjustment to sophisticated automatic control. No runoff of fertilizers into ground water. Less evaporation losses of water as compared to surface irrigation. Improves seed germination. Decreased to tillage operations. Disadvantages of Drip Irrigation In spite of the fact that drip irrigation has so many potential benefits , they're a certain limitation also, there are as follow: Sensitivity to clogging Moisture distribution problem Salinity hazards High cost compared to furrow. High skill is required for design, install and operation SPRINKLER IRRIGATION In the sprinkler method of irrigation, water is sprayed into the air and allowed to fall on the ground surface somewhat resembling rainfall. The spray is developed by the flow of water under pressure through small orifices or nozzles. The pressure is usually obtained by pumping. With careful selection of nozzle sizes, operating pressure and sprinkler spacing the amount of irrigation water required to refill the crop root zone can be applied nearly uniform at the rate to suit the infiltration rate of soil. Advantages of Sprinkler Irrigation Elimination of the channels for conveyance, therefore no conveyance loss, Suitable to all types of soil except heavy clay, Suitable for irrigating crops where the plant population per unit area is very high. It is most suitable for oil seeds and other cereal and vegetable crops, Water saving,introductory agricul ture71 Closer control of water application convenient for giving light and frequent irrigation and higher water application efficiency, Increase in yield, Mobility of system, May also be used for undulating area, Saves land as no bunds etc. are required, Influences greater conducive micro-climate, Areas located at a higher elevation than the source can be irrigated, Possibility of using soluble fertilizers and chemicals, Less problem of clogging of sprinkler nozzles due to sediment laden water. Disadvantages of Sprinkler Irrigation Incurs high operation expenses due to the energy needed for pumping, labour and relatively large investment in equipment, Sensitivity to wind, causing evaporation losses, The unavoidable wetting of foliage in field crops results in increased sensitivity to diseases, Debris and sediments can cause clogging, Capital cost is high with greater operational costs due to higher energy requirements. Soil -Plant - Water - Relationships Soil -Plant -Water relation relates to the physical properties of soil and plants that effect the movement, retention and use of water. These relations must be considered in designing and operation systems. Soil is a store house of plant nutrients, a habitat for bacteria , an anchorage for plant and a reservoir that hold the water needed for plant growth. The amount of water a soil can hold in available from for plant use is determined by its physical properties. This amount determines the length of time a plant can survive without water being added. It determines both the frequency of irrigation and the capacity of irrigation system needed to ensure continuous crop growth. Soil is a three phase system comprising of the soil phase made of mineral and organic matter and various chemical compounds, the liquid phase called soil moisture and the gaseous phase called the soil air. They also contain variety of living an organism. Two important physical properties of soil, which differ the supply of water and air in soil, are texture and structure. 72Classification of Soil Water Although the soil water cannot be demarcated, yet for the sake of understanding, and as per utility of that water to plants, it is mainly classified into three categories: a. Hygroscopic water b. Capillary water c. Gravitational water a) hygroscopic WaterIt is the part of soil water which is very tightly held on the surface of soil particle invery thin film by the forces of adhesion and cohesion. It is mostly in vapour from and the force with which it is held on the surface of soil particle is estimated at about 10,000 atmosphere towards the inner side and about 31 atmosphere at the outer side. Hygroscopic water is not available to the plant and agriculturally it has no importance. b) Capillary Water The capillary water is that water which held in the soil in excess of hygroscopic water, but is upto the point where the gravity pull begins to move the water downwards when fee drainage conditions exist in the soil. Capillary water is rather lossely held water (from 31 atm, to 1/3 atm tension) and it moves more slowly than free water; it can move in any direction, but always in the direction greatest tension. A soil, which has a finer texture and granular indicating larger proportion of micro pores than macro pores, holds more amount of capillary water than course textured single grained sandy soil having more percentage of macro pores. Similarly, soils rich in organic matter content also hold a much greater quantity of capillary water. c) Gravitational Water When all the pores, large and small are filled, the soil is to be saturated that is at its maximum retentive capacity. Within 2 to 3 days after heavy irrigation, the gravitational water or free water gets drained away and the moisture content at this stage in the surface soil is said to be at field capacity the moisture content at this stage is about one third atmosphere. Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) or Wilting Point (WP) is defined as the minimal point of soil moisture the plant requires not to wilt and water present in the soil at 31 atmosphere. If moisture decreases to this or any lower point a plant wilts and can no longer recover its turgidity when placed in a saturated atmosphere for 12 hours. Moisture present between field capacity to Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) is called as available water. This amount of water is biologically introductory agricul ture73available to the plant for their physiological requirement. There have been various methods developed to determine the water requirement for specific plants.Critical growth stages and water requirements of important crops are presented in the Table. Table: critical growth stages and water requirements of important crops.

One measurement should be made in upper quarter of the root zone and one or more two measurement at lower levels. Moisture Measuring Instruments Various instruments for measuring are available commercially. These instruments may not given accurate results as the soil sampling and drying procedure but are sufficiently accurate for practical purpose. To types of instruments commonly in use to measure the soil moisture are : 1. Tensiometer 2. Electrical Resistance Measuring Devices 3. Neutron Moisture Meter. Soil and Water Conservation Methods - Management Practices a) Strip Cropping: This consists of growing erosion permitting crops and erosion resisting crops in alternate strips. The erosion permitting crops are cotton, jawar, bajara, etc. which allow the runoff water to flow freely within the rows. The erosions resisting crops are mostly legumes like groundnut, aconitiolius), Kulathi (Dolichos biflorus), Soy bean (Glycine max) which spread and cover the soil and do not allow runoff water to carry much soil with it the soil which flows from the strips growing erosion permiuming crops is caught by the alternating springs. In selecting a suitable legume crop it should be seen that the maximum canopy and root development of the crop coincide with the period of high intensity of rainfall. b) Mulching: A mulch is natural or artificially applied layer of plant residues or other material on the surface of the soil with the object of moisture conservation, temperature control, prevention of surface compaction or crust formation, reduction of run off and erosion, improvement in soil structure and weed control. Artificial mulches of different kinds such as Jowar or bajara stubbles, stubbles, paddy straw or husk, sawdust etc., increase absorption of water and minimize evaporation. They also control run off and soil losses. c) Rotation of Crops: Rotation means growing a set of crops in a regular succession over the same field within a specified period of time. Continuous growing of Jowar or bajara crop causes more erosion, but if followed by a legume crop viz., hulga, matki or gram which covers the soil is causes less erosion. Rotation also helps in removal introductory agricul ture75of plant nutrients in a uniform way from future depth of soil and in maintaining the fertility of the soil in dry farming region of Maharashtra adoption of gram Jowar rotation not only helps in conservation of moisture but also in increasing the crop yields the beneficial effect of rotation can be seen from the following table. d) Contour Cultivation: Tillage operations viz., ploughing, harrowing, sowing and Interculture should be done across the slope of land. This will help in creating obstructions to the flow of water at every furrow, which acts like a small bund and results in uniform distribution of water. This helps more initration of water less run off and erosion, and gives higher crop yield. Any cultivation done along the slope will accelerate golly formation, more run off and erosion and consequently permanent damage to land. e) Planting of Grasses for Stabilizing Bunds: Grasses prevent soil erosion and improve soil structure. The entire soil mass is penetrated by countless roots and soil aggregates and particles are enmeshed by the root system. Grasses should be grown on bunds which are not suitable for cultivation, both for checking erosion and providing pasture for cattle. Several grasses as well as legumes were tried on bunds at the Agricultural Research Station; Solapur which receives about 600 mm. of rainfall to see which of them will withstand drought conditions, give maximum root growth and canopy coverage, and stabilize bunds effectively. It was observed that anjan planted with spacing of 15 x 15 cm., produced the highest quantity of roots, followed by marvel - 8, Rhodes, thin Napier, blue panic, and kusal. Legumes do not have many roots but produce better canopy within a short period, while grasses are under the process of establishment. Planting of legumes mixed with grasses is, therefore, advantageous in preventing soil erosion in initial stages. f) Planting of Trees and Afforestation: Forests conserve soil and water quite effectively. They not only obstruct the flow of water, but the falling leaves provide organic matter which increases the water holding capacity of the soil. If tree planting is done in the planned manner in open areas, it will serve as good wind break and if done along the banks of streams and rivers, it will regulate their flow. Farm forestry is another important aspect in soil and water conservation. The danger caused by deforestation has been only recently appreciated and a big plantation programme of hybrid eucalyptus, teak, casurina has been taken up by the Forest Departments in reserve forests, catchments areas of irrigation projects and on Government waste lands Vanamahotsava is also observed every year in the early part of monsoon and millions of trees are planted by the public with the help of the maff of the Agricultural and Forest Departments local bodies like Zillah Paris had, Panchayat Samitis and Gram Panchayat What is however important is to pay proper attention planted. g) Cashew Nut Plantation : In coastal districts of Maharashtra which receive more than, 1,250 mm. rainfall a new programme of cashew nut plantation has been undertaken 76from 1963 - 64 on hills having slope between 10 and 20 per cent. The sea breeze is conducive to the growth of cashew nut plants and they do not require much aftercare once they establish in the soil. Staggered trenches of 300 x 30 x 30 cm. size are dug on contours at a distance of 6m. Cashew plants are raised in polythene bags in nurseries and two months old saplings are planted on the lower side of the trench with plant to plant distance of 6m. Package of Practices of Crops under Rain Fed Conditions Choice of Crop and Varieties for Rain fed Agriculture Dry land constitutes about 75 per cent of cultivatable lands in the country. And contribute about 42 per cent of off grains, almost all the coarse grains and 75 percent pulses and oilseeds. More than 90% of sorghum, Pearl millet, groundnut and pulses are grown in arid and semi arid areas. At present, the cultivable area under Dry land agriculture in the state is 87% and only 13% area is under irrigation. After harvesting all available water resources, it is possible to bring it to 30%. It means 70% of the cultivable area will remain as Rain fed in the state. Under this situation the state will have to depend upon for its major share of food production on Dry land. However, the Dry land agriculture suffers from two problems viz. low productivity and high in stability. The reasons for low productivity in Rain Fed area are1. Lack of moisture conservation practices. 2. Low rate of fertilizer use. 3. Lack of timely farm operations. 4. Improper crop planning as per land capability. 5. Inadequate efforts to increase water resources. 6. Unpredictable rainfall situations. 7. Lack of improved Technology The adoption of improved Dryland technology will be the only answer to mitigate above situation. Considerable research efforts are being made in the state to develop the improved the improved Dryland technologies since early seventies which will help to improve the crop production in Rain fed agriculture. The important improved Dryland technologies are given below 1. Selection of efficient crops and their varieties. 2. Crop planning as per length of cropping season. 3.

Livestock production accounts for 15-40 per cent of the total farm income of the rural households. Livestock is also important as a part of agriculture diversification and provider of livelihoods, and crucial for nutritional security in the rural areas. The sector employs about eight per cent of the country's labour force, including small and marginal farmers, women, and landless agricultural workers. Milk production alone involves more than 30 million small producers/households, each raising one or two cows or buffaloes annually. Livestock provides a large share of draught power and acts as a supplementary and complementary enterprise. In India, about 33 % of the agricultural GDP is contributed by this sector and its contribution to country's GDP is about 4 %. With a large population and recent growth in consumer incomes, there has been a rapid rise in the demand for livestock products in India, and consumer expenditure on livestock products has risen rapidly over recent years. Dairy sector contributes by way of cash income, draught power and manure. Livestock serves human needs by way of providing food, fibre, fuel, fertilizer, skins and traction. It is a living bank providing flexible finance in times of emergencies and also serves as insurance against crop failure for survival. If agriculture is the foundation of our national economy animal husbandry constitutes the sheet anchor of agriculture. Indian agriculture marches on the patient back of the bullock. Seventy six percent of the milk is produced by weaker sections of society. One fifth of the world's livestock population is present in India. India has nearly 58 % of the world's buffalo population, 16% of the cattle population, 20% of goat population and 5 % of sheep population although India constitutes less than 2.5 % of the world's total land area. introductory agricul ture79Classification of Livestock A number of livestock species were domesticated in different times in different parts of world but mostly within old world of S E Asia, West Asia and North Africa beginning with goat, cattle, sheep, pig, poultry and camel, during prehistoric times between 8000 to 3200 BC. India is bestowed with rich diversity of various livestock as the sub-continent is one of the 12 mega diversity centers of the world. India ranks first in cattle and buffalo population, second in goat, third in sheep and seventh in poultry population in the world. India is the largest producer of milk and third largest producer of eggs and fifth largest producer of broilers in the world. India is home to some 57 % buffaloes and 14 % cattle with 37 breeds of cattle, 13 of buffalo, 39 of sheep, 23 of goat, 2 of pig, 8 of camel and 15 of chicken. FishesIndia is a major supplier of fish in the world as it ranks at number two after China. Shrimps are one of the major varieties exported. The giant tiger prawn is the dominant species chosen for aquaculture, followed by the Indian white prawn. There are about 28,100 species of fishes known to science; they are divided into 4 classes, 59 orders, 490 families and 4,300 or so genera. About 15,000 species of them are marine. The classification system of fish is not stagnant and it will change when there is more knowledge, perhaps from DNA analyses. For common people the following classification should work: Phylum: Osreichthyes Trout, Salmon, Sardines, Eels, Catfishes, Dolphins etc. (Fish) Some of the common fishes in India are Rohu, Katla (Bengal Carp), (Ghongha), Pomfret (Paplet). The marine fish harvested in India consist of about 65 commercially important species/ groups. Shrimps are one of the major varieties exported. The giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) is the dominant species chosen for aquaculture, followed by the Indian White prawn.80Breeds of Cattle Indigenous Breeds: Indigenous breeds are classified under three groups based on utility/ purpose as below: 1. Milch cows of these breeds are high milk yielders and the male animals are slow or poor work animals. The examples of Indian milch breeds are Tharparkar (Rajasthan). The Sahiwal breed is well known for its highest milk production (2000 kg). The average milk production of milch breeds is more than 1600 kg per lactation. Sahiwal Red Sindhi Dual Purpose Breeds The cows in these breeds are average milk yielder and male animals are very useful for work. Their milk production per lactation is 500 kg to 1500 kg. The examples of this group are Hariana, Ongole, Kankrej, agricul ture81Kankrej hariana Draught Breeds The male animals are excellent for work and cows are poor milk yielders. Their average milk yield is less than 500 kg per lactation. They are usually white in color. The examples of this group are hol holstein Friesian Brown Swiss Jersey Exotic Beef Breeds: The important beef breeds are Hereford, Short Horn and Angus.82Cross Breeding It is mating of animals of different breeds. Cross breeding is followed for breeding animals for milk production and meat production. In India, zebu cattle breeds and nondescript/ Desi cows have been crossed with exotic breeds like Holstein Friesian, Brown Swiss and Jersey bulls or their semen, to enhance the milk production potential of the progeny. Examples are Jersey crosses and Holstein Friesian (HF) crosses which produce about 4000 and 3000 kg milk per lactation, respectively. Jersey Cross holstein Friesian Cross Buffaloes The buffalo species originated in India. The important breeds Murrah (Gujarat) and Mehsana (Gujarat). Buffaloes contribute immensely (more than 55 %) in countries milk production. Murrah breed is well known for its highest milk production. Murrah Nilli-Raviintroductory agricul ture83Sheep Rearing Sheep can be reared as free range (where there is no shortage of land) or under stall feeding inside a shed. It is a very important component in dry land farming system. Sheep with its multi-facet utility for wool, meat, milk, skins and manure, form an important component of rural economy particularly in the arid, semi-arid and mountainous areas of the country. It provides a dependable source of income to the shepherds through sale of wool and animals. Sheep manure is an important source of organic fertilizer especially in the southern state where they are folded on fallow land for increasing fertility of the soil. Sheep are mostly maintained on natural vegetation grazing lands (common) waste lands and uncultivated lands, stables of cultivated crops and tree loppings. Sheep are mostly reared for meat and wool. India can be divided into four agro-ecological regions viz. I. North-western arid and semi-arid region II. Southern peninsular region, III. Eastern region and IV.Northern temperate region. There are about 39 descript breeds of sheep available in India. I. North-western, Central Arid and Semi-arid Region: The Nali, Magra (Bikaneri) which produce carpet wool. Rajasthan has the highest population of sheep in India. II. Southern Peninsular Region: The important breeds of this and Nilgiri. Most breeds are meat and carpet wool type except Nilgiri which produces apparel wool. 84III. Eastern Region: Most of the wool produced by breeds of this region is suitable only for coarse carpets, blankets and kumblies. The important breeds are Region: The largest population of crossbred sheep primarily developed for apparel wool is in this region. The important breeds famous for producing very fine wool known as Pashmina which is used for making expansive garments. Exotic Breeds of Sheep: Merino (Spain) and Rambouillet (France) for very fine wool, Suffolk (UK) and Dorset (UK) for mutton and Corriedale (New Zealand) for both (dual).Goat Keeping Goat is known as 'poor men's cow' in India and is a very important component in dry land farming system. Marginal or undulating lands unsuitable for other types of animals like cows or buffaloes, goats are the best alternative. With very low investments goat rearing can be made in to a profitable venture for small and marginal farmers. Goats are reared for milk and meat. An allergy to goat milk is very rare. Indian Goat Breeds: There are about 23 well defined Indian breeds apart from a number of local non-descript goats scattered throughout the country. The breeds are classified based on 4 agro-climatic regions. 1. North Temperate/Himalayan Region (hilly tract): The goats of this breed are white haired and sturdily built. The important breeds Spiti) and Gaddi (Kangra) which produce fine wool. Castrated bucks are used for transporting merchandise in the hilly tracts. 2. North-western Arid and Semi-arid Region: The important Jamunapari is biggest breed of goat and highest milk producer. 3. Southern Peninsular Region: The important breeds are Osmanabadi & Sangamneri from M. S. and Malabari (Kerala). 4. Eastern Region: The important breeds are Black Bengal and Ganjam (Odissa). Black Bengal breed is famous for its prolificacy and good quality meat. Exotic Breeds: The principal exotic dairy breeds of goats are Toggenberg, Sannen, Alpine, Nubian, Anglo-Nubian and Boer. They are all noted for their higher milk yield and most of these breed, were imported to India to improve milk yield of our local breeds and to upgrade our nondescript/ Desi goats. Angora from Asia Minor in Turkey is famous for producing very fine fibre known as Mohair which is used for making expansive garments.introductory agricul ture85 Jamunapari Tellicherry Boer Camels A camel is an even toed ungulate within the genus Camelus, bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as \"humps\" on its back. The two surviving species of camel are the dromedary, or one- humped camel (C. dromedarius), which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; and the Bactrian, or two-humped camel (C. bactrianus), which inhabits Central Asia. Both species have been domesticated; they provide milk, meat, hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads even without food or water for days. \"Camel\" is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camel-like mammals in the family Camelidae: the two true camels and the four New World camelids: the llama, alpaca, guanaco, and vicuna of South America. The total camel population in the country is 0.4 millions in 2012. Camels can run at up to 65 km/h (40 mph) in short bursts and sustain speeds of up to 40 km/h (25 mph). Bactrian camels weigh 300 to 1,000 kg and dromedaries 300 to 600 kg. In India, camels population is concentrated in Rajasthan, Haryana and Gujarat. Registered Breeds: India has (PIG) husbandry India has a population of about 15 million pigs, which is less than 1 % world population but second-largest in the world. Unfortunately, there isn't a strong tradition of pig production or consumption in the country. Pigs are omnivores and convert inedible feeds, forages, and certain grain byproducts obtained from mills, meat by products, damaged feeds and garbage into valuable nutrition's mean. The pigs grow very fast and are a prolific breeder; farrowing 10-12 piglets at a time. With a small investment on building and equipment, proper feeding and sound disease control program the farmer can profitably utilize his time and labour in this subsidiary occupation. Important Breeds of Pigs: Large White Yorkshire (UK), Middle White Yorkshire (UK) and Landrace (Denmark).86 Poultry The term 'poultry' is applied to birds of several species like fowls or chicken, ducks, turkeys, quails, swan, pigeons, guinea fowl, pea fowl, pheasants etc. which have been domesticated to produce egg and meat. Fowls may be classified on the basis of utility, purpose such as meat type, egg type, dual purpose, game, ornamental etc. Birds are also classified into different classes based on the country or particular region of their origin such as Asiatic, Mediterranean, American, and English etc. Each class is further classified into breeds based on shape, size and colour etc. such as Minorca, Leghorn, Rhode Island Red, New Hampshire etc. Each breed may be further classified into varieties based on type of comb and colour of plumage e.g. Leghorn varieties are single comb White Leghorn. Each variety can be further redivided into strains which can be named after a breeder or farm etc. Classification of Breeds of Chicken There are more than 10 classes based on the place of origin of breeds but only breeds of four classes are popular. 1. American Class: New Hampshire, Plymouth Rock, Rhode Island Red and Wyandote. 2. Mediterranean Class: They are light bodied and well developed for high egg production. Eg. Leghorns, Minorca and Ancona from Spain. White Leghorn is the best breed for egg production. 3. English Class: They are mostly utility breeds noted for their excellent fleshing properties. Eg. Australorp, Cornish, Sussex and Orpington. Cornish is the best breed for meat production. 4. Asiatic Class: They are large bodied with heavy bones, feathered shanks and poor layers. Eg. Cochin, Langshan and (barred) Leghorn Commercial Broiler Hubbard, Lohman, Arbor Acres, Avian, Commercial Layer Strains/Brands: Babcock N Lohman, Hisex, Shaver, etc. Indian Poultry Breeds: There are about 15 chicken breeds but most are poor layers and slow growing. They lay about 60-80 eggs but are excellent mothers. Eg. Aseel (fighting purpose), and Kadaknath (flesh is black). Broilers: Broilers are young chicken of either sex, having rapid growth and tender meat which are reared for meat and marketed at an age of 6-8 weeks. Growers: The management of birds during 9-20 weeks or to the point of laying is referred to as grower period. Layers: The management of birds during 21-72 weeks of age for the purpose of laying eggs (egg production).Care and Management of Dairy AnimalsCare and Management of Calf: We must give good feeding and management for the calves so that they develop well and, useful as the replacement stock. The dam should be dried 6-8 weeks before expected calving and should be fed well. Under fed animals will give weak and small calves. Early Management Immediately after birth remove any mucous or phlegm from those nose and mouth. Normally the cow licks the calf immediately after birth. This helps dry off the calf and 88helps in stimulating breathing and circulation. When the cow does not lick or in cold climate, rub and dry the calf with a dry cloth or gunny bag. The navel should be tied about 2.5 cm away from the body and cut 1cm below the ligature and apply tincture iodine or boric acid or any antibiotic. Remove the wet bedding from the pen and keep the stall very clean and dry in condition. The weight of the calf should be recorded. Wash the cow's udder and teats preferably with chlorine solution and dry. The calf will try to stand within few minutes and attempts to suckle within one hour. Otherwise help too weak calves in standing and suckling. Allow the calf to suckle the first milk of the mother i.e. colostrums.

The following care and Management practices are recommended for a heifer.introductory agricul ture89 Feed the heifer sufficiently to attain normal growth. During the early stage relatively more protein than energy is needed. Most heifers grow well if excellent hay is given as much they can eat. The amount of growth depends upon the quality of forage fed. The heifers should be provided with a dry shelter free from drafts. A loose housing system with a shelter open to one side is sufficient. The size rather than the age of a dairy heifer at breeding time is important. Breeding under sized animals is never profitable. They may be stunted or slow to reach maximum size. Small heifers are more likely to have difficulty in calving. Though the heifer that is bred to calve at an older age yields higher milk in the first lactation, the total milk produced by such a cow will be less when compared to the heifers that freshens at an early age. Table: Feeding schedule of growing animals from 6 months onwards Age (months) Approx. body weight (kg) Concentrate mixture (kg) Green fodder (kg) Dry fodder and Management of Milch Animals: To get high milk during any lactation, the milch animals should be properly fed and necessary care and managemental practices should be followed as below: Provide green succulent fodder together with leguminous hay or straw to the extent of animal can consume, so that all its maintenance requirements are met with through fodder only. Extra concentrate at the rate of 1 kg for every 3 liters of milk should be provided. Salt and mineral supplements should be given to maintain the lactation. Never frighten or excite the animals. Always treat them gently and with kindness. Do not withhold service unnecessarily after the signs of heat are noticed in a cow but only after 60 days of calving. The shorter the interval between calvings, the more efficient the animal is as a milk producer. Service the cow in the evening if the cow has come into heat in the morning; service the cow next morning if the cow has come into the heat in the evening (AM-PM rule). By maintaining proper records of breeding and calving of the animals will ensure a steady flow of milk throughout the year. Water should be provided to drink at will or at frequent intervals. Rapid, continuous, dry hand milking should be practiced without undue jerking of teats. Milking should be done with full hand, not with thumb and index finger. 90 Cows should be trained to let down milk without calf suckling. This will help to wean the calves early. Loose housing with shelter during hot part of the day should be provided. The animals will get benefit of maximum exercise in loose housing system. Grooming of the cows and washing of the buffaloes before milking help in clean milk production. Daily brushing will remove loose hair and dirt from the coat. Grooming will also keep the animal hide pliable. Wallowing of buffaloes or water spraying on their bodies will keep the buffaloes comfortable especially in summer. Common ailments should be properly detected and treated. Common vices should be properly detected and care should be taken. Eg: kicking, licking, sucking etc. Provide at least 60 - 90 days dry period between calving. If the dry period is not sufficient, the milk yield is subsequent lactation will be reduced. Vaccinate the cows- against important diseases and also guard against insects and pests. Check for mastitis regularly. Table: Feeding schedules for dairy animals (kg) S.

Horns are the single major cause of carcass wastage due to bruising, and trim associated with bruising for carcasses from horned cattle is approximately twice that for carcasses from hornless cattle. Dehorned cattle require less feeding trough space; are easier and less dangerous to handle and transport; present a lower risk of interference from dominant animals at feeding time; pose a reduced risk of injury to udders, flanks, and eyes of other cattle; present a lower injury risk for handlers, horses, and dogs; exhibit fewer aggressive behaviors associated with individual dominance; and may incur fewer financial penalties on sale. Castration: It is very common for young male sheep, goats and calves to be castrated, because castrated animals are usually easier to manage from the age of puberty, i.e. from about 6 months of age. Poultry Production and Management India has made considerable progress in poultry production in the last 3-4 decades. High quality chicks, equipments, vaccines and medicines are available. Chickens are kept for eggs (layers/egg type) and meat (broilers/meat type). With an annual output of 65 billion eggs and 2500 million broilers, India ranks third in production of eggs after China & USA and 5th in broilers after USA, China, Brazil & Mexico in the world. The poultry production has been growing at a steady annual growth rate of about 8-10 % as against 5 and 2 % growth in milk and food production. Poultry farming has been given considerable importance in the national policy and has a good scope for further development in the years to come. The per capita availability of eggs and poultry meat has increased from a meager 10 eggs and 155 g meat in seventies to 55 eggs and 2.6 kg meat in India per year against the recommended level of 180 eggs and 11 kg meat. But, there is a vast gap for the per capita availability of eggs in rural and urban India (6 vs. 185 eggs) which needs to be bridged to improve the nutritional status of rural masses 92housing (deep litter) & Brooding Management: Poultry houses should be located on an elevated piece of land and away from habitations with east-west orientation. The masonry sidewalls of the brooder house may be \u00be closed (lower 6 feet bricked) and \u00bc open (upper 2 feet wire meshed) with a cement concrete floor and a plinth of 2-3 feet. The roofing material should be chosen keeping in mind the cost, availability and suitability of materials like asbestos-cement sheets, light roofing material or thatches etc. The floor, feeder and waterer space requirements during brooding are 1 sq. ft, 3 and 0.6 linear inch. Add 2-3\" layer of any litter material like sawdust, rice husk, ground nut hulls and chopped grasses on the floor. Place the brooder in the middle of the area and encircle the brooder with chick guard. Fix 2-4 bulbs of 40-100 watts inside the brooder depending upon the season and get a brooder temperature of 90-95\u00ba F. Place 4 waterers and feeders each for 250 chicks. Purchase chicks from reputed or government run hatcheries like Central Avian Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP . Decrease it at the rate of 5\u00ba F per week till 4-5 weeks of age. health Management: The chicks must be vaccinated against all the prevalent diseases like Marek's, Ranikhet, Gumboro, Infectious bronchitis and Fowl pox as per the schedule. Keep a watch on coccidiosis after three weeks and start mixing coccidiostats in the feed or in drinking water. Consult a poultry veterinarian in case of any disease problem. Dispose the dead birds properly in an incinerator. Follow bio-security measures strictly which include restricted entry of visitors, minimum movement of personnel from one unit to another; plugging of leakage of water lines and their regular flushing; all-in; all-out system of rearing, proper disposal of old litter/farm waste and dead birds and keeping premises free from rodents and wild birds. Prevention of Vices: Vices in birds are cannibalism, feather picking, breaking egg, egg eating, bullying etc. Debeak the pullets at the age of 14 weeks and again at 6 months. Increase the salt in feed by 1% temporarily. Prevent overcrowding, provide balanced feed and adopt proper lighting programme. Common health Problems in Livestock and their Management The Main Causes of Disease: Disease can be classified as acute or chronic depending upon severity of the disese. An acute disease starts quickly and lasts for a short period when the animal either recovers or dies. A chronic disease lasts for a long time and weakens the animal. Diseases are said to be infectious (will spread from one animal to another) or noninfectious (will not spread from one animal to another) depending upon their cause. Non-infectious diseases can be caused by poor feed and the lack of minerals and vitamins that the body needs. Non-infectious disease can also be caused by poisoning with chemicals or plants, by cuts, burns and broken bones. Some diseases pass from the parent to the young (hereditary). Many non-infectious diseases are chronic but they can be acute. They can cause large losses of meat, milk and wool. Working (draught) animals do not work well and the rate of reproduction can be low with the young being born dead or dying before they are weaned. Chronic diseases are often thought to be \"normal\" but when the cause is known introductory agricul ture93and eliminated production can be greatly increased. Infectious diseases are caused when the body is attacked by tiny living germs/pathogens. The Spread of Disease: Infectious diseases can be spread by: By faeces and urine from sick animals Animals, people and machinery moving between and within farms Farm visitors - people and vehicles Introducing new animals from within or outside the country direct contact between animals or contact with neighbours' livestock Shared farm equipments Germs in feed and water Contamination by vermins, wild birds and pastures Animals drinking from contaminated rivers and streams By flies, ticks, lice and fleas (vectors) Young and old animals become infected more easily Preventing Infectious Diseases Do their best to keep animal diseases out of their premises Ensure adequate sanitation & hygiene (bio-security) Be alert to symptoms of diseases The animal must be provided with clean feed, water, bedding and shelter Sick animals should be kept separate from the others Some diseases can be cured by drugs Vaccination can protect animals against some diseases Dead animals and waste should be disposed of properly Comply with requirements when importing animals from other countries Good hygiene and Bio-security MeasuresThere are several hygiene and bio-security measures (starting from lay out and construction of farm) that should be part of the farm routine. The key to good bio-security is reducing and controlling the movements of people, vehicles or equipment into areas where the farm 94animals are kept. One should clean and disinfect protective clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with farm animals. Where practicable, one should use disposable protective clothing. Some diseases are more prevalent than others. For example, for livestock, one should be particularly be on the alert for foot and mouth disease (FMD), hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) and Peste des petits ruminants (PPR in goats/sheep) whereas poultry keepers need to be vigilant against avian influenza (bird flu), Gumboro (IBD) and Ranikhet diseases. Recognizing Sick AnimalsThe first step in disease recognition and control is being able to recognize when an animal or group of animals is unwell by observing at visual signs of cattle illness. By compiling information from the history of an animal or group of animals, conducting a physical examination, and undertaking special testing (if necessary) the veterinarian is generally able to determine the cause of a condition or disease. The following list outlines some of the more common signs that can be looked out for in an ill animal: The animal not eating as much as usual - this is usually the first sign you will notice. It may also drink more or less water than normal, depending on the illness. An animal standing by itself away from the herd The animal not getting up and walking to the feed bunk - A very sick animal will lie down for long periods and will not get up when approached. Animal limping or dragging a leg Discharge from eyes, nose, or vaginal area There may be abnormal lumps The eyes may be dull and the mucous membranes may have changed colour. Deep red membranes indicate fever; pale membranes show anaemia; yellow membranes indicate a liver disorder, while blue-red membranes show heart and circulatory problems, or pneumonia. Animal making unusual noise (bellowing, grunting) Animal acting uncomfortable, getting up and down The animal might be sweating. A cold sweat indicates pain while a hot sweat indicates fever. If the animal is in pain it will probably be restless (getting up and down and pacing about), and it may even be groaning Diarrhoea or straining to defecateintroductory agricul ture95 Animal not defecating or with very little stool Animal urinating a lot, or not as much as usual Marked weight loss or gain The coat will look dull and dry, and the hairs may stand up. There may the presence of open sores, dandruff, or the loss of hair or fur from the body Behavioural signs - Recognise any significant differences in the behaviour of an animal such as increases in viciousness, lethargy or any other abnormal signs such as excessive head shaking, scratching, licking or biting of certain parts of the body The temperature may go up or down. A rise in temperature of one or two degrees usually indicates pain, while a rise of more usually indicates infection. The rate of respiration, and the way the animal breathes could also slow changes. With pain or infection, breathing becomes more rapid. In a very sick animal, breathing can be laboured and shallow. A slightly increased pulse rate suggests pain, while a rapid pulse suggests fever. An irregular pulse can indicate heart trouble. In a very sick animal, the pulse is weak and feeble. A sick animal may also possess foul breath or excessive tarter deposits on the teeth. When using visual appraisal, one of the most important signals of illness is appetite suppression. Feed consumption of cattle exposed to respiratory disease begins to decrease about 48 hours before increased body temperature is observed. Infectious Disease of Animals The infectious diseases may be bacterial, viral, and parasitic whereas non infectious ones may be due to nutritional deficiency and non-specific disorders as listed below: 1) Bacterial Diseases (i) Anthrax (ii) Haemorrhagic septicemia (HS) (iii) Black quarter (BQ) (iv) Bovine tuberculosis (v) Brucellosis (vi) Mastitis962) Viral Diseases (i) Foot and mouth disease (FMD) 3) Parasitic Diseases (i) Anaplasmosis (ii) Bovine babesiosis (Red water disease, Tick fever) (iii) Endo-parasites (worms & flukes) and ecto-parasites (ticks, lice etc) 4) Non Infectious /Metabolic Diseases (i) Milk fever (ii) Bloat (tympany) Vaccination schedule (cattle & buffaloes) Diseases Age Interval Month FMD 3rd month Every six month Jan-Feb, June-July BQ 6th Month Every year Aug-Sep HS 6th Month Every year Sep-Oct Anthrax 6th Month Every year (only affected area) April - May Brucellosis 4-8th month of heifer -- Mar - April Diseases of Goat and their Prevention Generally goats are resistant to many diseases. However when we rear more number of animals in one place and insufficiency of pasture facilities, intensive system of rearing leads to spread of many diseases. This causes reduced production potential and more mortality which in turn causes economic losses to the farmers. Hence identification of diseases in goat and its prevention is most important. Health management is more important especially worm load. Hence the kids must be dewormed at first month of age and then once in a month up to 6 months of age. Ecto-parasites must be treated carefully because it not only affect the growth and also affect skin quality. Goats should be vaccinated against all diseases like: PPR, Haemorrhagic Septicemia, Black Quarter, Caprine pleuropneumonia and Enterotoxaemica.

Explain principles involved in care and maintenance of agricultural machinery. Explain principles involved in agricultural processing and storage. INTRODUCTIONFarm implements and machinery are used for different operations in agricultural field for successfully raising of crops, its harvesting, threshing and further processing. Different farm implements are used for primary and secondary tillage, seeding, harvesting, threshing etc. These are described as follows. Tillage It is the basic operation in farming. Tillage is the mechanical manipulation of soil to provide favourable conditions for crop production. It is done to create a favourable condition for seed placement and plant growth. Tillage operations include ploughing, harrowing and mechanical destruction of weeds and soil crust etc. There are two types of tillage, Primary tillage and Secondary tillage. The purpose of ploughing is to obtain seed bed of good texture, to increase the water holding capacity of the soil, to improve soil aeration, to destroy weeds and grasses, to destroy insects and pests, to prevent soil erosion and to add fertility to the soil by covering vegetation. Tillage can be classified into two:1. Primary Tillage: It is the initial and primary major soil working operation to reduce soil strength, to remove and cover plant materials and to rearrange aggregates in a view to prepare seed bed, implements may be animal drawn or tractor drawn, some of the primary tillage implements are: a) Mould board plough or MB Plough b) Disc Plough c) Sub-soiler d) Chisel plough 2. Secondary Tillage: It is the tillage operation performed after primary tillage to create proper soil tilth for seeding and planting. These are lighter and finer operations performed on the soil, the implements include a) Cultivators: Spring tine, Spring loaded, Rigid tine and Duck foot cultivators b) Harrows; Spike tooth, spring tooth, animal drawn disc harrows, Levellers d) Clod crushers e) Rotovator Used for seed bed preparation in dry and garden lands, and also for puddling in standing water f) Puddler: Used for churning the soil in standing water for the preparation of field for paddy cultivation g) Ridger & furrow opener: Used for opening ridges and furrows for line sowing, watering h) Bund former: Used to make bunds in and around the field, to conserve the top fertile soil, and rain water There are a number of farm implements used for tillage operations. These are described as follows: Plow: It is one of the most important tillage implement for the primary tillage. The basic components of the plough are a shoe, a share, a body, a handle and a beam. The plough is a tool used in farming for initial cultivation of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting to loosen or turn the soil. Ploughs are drawn by working animals or by tractors. A plough may be made of wood, iron, or steel frame with an attached blade or stick used to cut the earth. The primary purpose of ploughing is to turn over the upper layer of the soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface, while burying weeds, the remains of previous crops and allowing them to break down. As the plough is drawn through the soil it creates long trenches of fertile soil called furrows. The ploughs are of Mould board type and Disc types. Mouldboard Plough Disc Plough harrow : It is an implement for breaking up and smoothing out the surface of the soil and is used for secondary tillage. In this way it is distinct in its effect from the plough, which is used for deeper tillage. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough finish left by ploughing operations. The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is suitable for introductory agricul ture101seedbed use. Coarser harrowing may also be used to remove weedsand to cover seed after sowing. Harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, such as to prepare a seedbed, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that skirt crop rows (to kill weeds). There are four general types of harrows: disc harrow, tine harrow, chain harrow and chain disk harrows. Harrows were originally drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, or in some times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch. Disc harrow Disc harrow (with notched discs) Seed Drill: It is a sowing device that precisely positions seeds in the soil and then covers them. Before the introduction of the seed drill, the common practice was to plant seeds by hand. Besides being wasteful, planting was very imprecise and led to a poor distribution of seeds, leading to low productivity. Points to remember Farm implements and machinery are used for different operations in agricultural field for successfully raising of crops, its harvesting, threshing and further processing. Tillage is the mechanical manipulation of soil to provide favourable conditions for crop production. It is done to create a favourable condition for seed placement and plant growth. Tillage can be classified as Primary tillage and Secondary tillage Plough is one of the most important tillage implement for the primary tillage. 102 Seed Drill Cultivator: It is a farm implement used for secondary tillage. One sense of the name refers to frames with teeth (shanks) that pierce the soil as they are dragged through it linearly. Another sense refers to machines that use rotary motion of disks or teeth to accomplish a similar result. Cultivators stir and pulverize the soil, either before planting (to aerate the soil and prepare a smooth, loose seedbed) or after the crop has begun growing (to kill weeds\u2014controlled disturbance of the topsoil close to the crop plants kills the surrounding weeds by uprooting them, burying their leaves to disrupt their photosynthesis, or a combination of both). Unlike a harrow, which disturbs the entire surface of the soil, cultivators are designed to disturb the soil in careful patterns, sparing the crop plants but disrupting the weeds. Cultivatorintroductory agricul ture103Reaper: It is a farming tool that reaps (cuts and gathers) crops at harvest, when they are ripe. Reaper Paddy Transplanter: It is used for transplanting the seedlings of rice in the field. The rice planter mainly consists of three parts, the motor and the running gear and the transplanter device. The transplanter includes the seedling tray, the seeding tray shifter, plural pickup forks. The seeding tray is like a shed roof where mat type rice nursery is set. When the rice transplanter is brought in the field, the seedlings are fed on the seedling trays. Then the tray shifts seedlings as pickup forks get seedlings from the tray and put into the ground. The pickup folks act like human figures by taking seedlings from the tray and pushing them into the earth. The machine can save considerable time and labor than the manual transplanting which make it popular among the farmers. Paddy Transplanter Manual Transplanting of Paddy Combine harvester or Combine: It is a machine that harvests grain crops. The name derives from its combining three separate operations comprising harvesting\u2014reaping, threshing, and winnowing into a single process. A large number of crops that can be harvested with a combine are wheat, oats, rye, barley, corn (maize), soybeans and flax (linseed). The waste straw left behind on the field is the 104remaining dried stems and leaves of the crop with limited nutrients which is either chopped and spread on the field or baled for feed and bedding for livestock. Combine harvesters are one of the most economically important labor saving inventions, enabling a small fraction of the population to be engaged in agriculture. Combine Thresher: It is used for the separation of grain from stalks and husks. For thousands of years, grain was separated by hand with flails, and was very laborious and time consuming. With the help of thresher, this work can be done speedily and smoothly with minimum labour. ThresherPoints to remember Cultivator is a farm implement used for secondary tillage. It helps to stir and pulverize the soil Seed drill is a sowing device that precisely positions seeds in the soil and then covers them. Paddy transplanter is used for transplanting the seedlings of rice in the field. The machine can save considerable time and labor than the manual transplanting which make it popular among the farmers. Combine harvester or combine is a machine in which harvesting, threshing, and winnowing takes place in a single process. introductory agricul ture105Weed Control: Weeding is an important operation to obtain higher yields. Hand weeding is tiresome, time consuming and labour intensive. Different weeding implements & equipments such as hand weeders (hand tools such as sickels, spades, hoes, cycle or wheel weeder), power weeders, inter-cultivators are used to control the weeds effectively. Plant Protection Equipment: Plant protection equipments are used to spray insecticides, pesticides; fungicides and herbicides to control insect pest, disease and complex weeds. Sprayers are also used for foliar application of nutrients for quality end-products. Many types of sprayers and dusters are used for the above task, which include manually operated hand compression sprayers (Knapsack -back), gator sprays, foot sprayer, powers sprayer, power-sprayer-cum mist blowers, tractor mounted boom sprayer, areal sprayers, dusters and fertilizer broad casters. The main functions of the sprayer includes, to break the liquid into fine droplets of effective size, to distribute uniformly on the target plants and to regulate the amount of liquid required by avoiding losses. Care and maintenance of common farm implementsCare and maintenance of farm implements is very important for their smooth operations and longevity. Agricultural implements mostly work in soil so it is very necessary to clean them properly before their storage for proper operation. A number of salient points are described below for care and maintenance of important farm machines and implements. A. Moldboard Plows 1. We must provide adequate front-end weight for tractor stability in transport and operation, particularly with integral and semi-integral plows. 2. Use extreme caution and reduce speed when transporting the plow and the tractor over rough ground. 3. Avoid sharp turns at high speeds, especially on slopes. 4. On tight turns, avoid swinging rear of plow into fences or other obstacles. 5. Never carry passengers on the tractor or permit others to ride on the plow - - particularly plows with automatic reset. 6. Always lower the plow when not in use or left unattended. 7. Lower the plow and securely pin the parking stand before detaching the plow from the tractor. B. Disk Plows 1. We must provide adequate tractor front-end weights are required to offset the plow weight. 1062. Semi-integral plows are quite long and caution must be used when turning to prevent swinging the plow into fences or irrigation ditches. 3. Reduce speed when transporting over rough ground, and avoid quick, sharp turns at high speeds. 4. Never permit anyone to ride on the plow, and allow only the driver on the tractor. Do not permit children to play on or near the plow either when parked or in operation. 5. Lower the parking stand and securely pin it in place before detaching integral or semi-integral plows from the tractor. C. Disk Tillers 1. Never allow anyone but the operator to ride on the tractor and the tiller. 2. Lower the tiller to the ground when not in use. 3. Secure the machine in the raised position by installing safety locks or hold-up pins when servicing or cleaning it. 4. Disk blades are extremely sharp so be careful when working or making adjustments in the disk area. 5. Never walk close beside the rear wheel when the tiller is in operation. A sudden imbalance of forces could cause this wheel suddenly to jump to the left. D. Chisel Plow 1. Reduce speed when transporting chisel plows over rough or uneven terrain. 2. Use lock-up straps or transport locks when transporting a chisel plow. 3. Ensure that the wings are locked in the folded position before traveling. 4. Allow only the operator to ride on the tractor and never allow passengers to ride on the chisel plow. 5. Provide adequate tractor front-end ballast for stability in transport and operation, especially with integral models. 6. Be careful of escaping hydraulic fluid, which can penetrate the skin and cause serious infection or reaction if not given immediate medical treatment. E. Disk harrows and Offset Disks 1. Always lock safety lock during transport, if the disk is to be left raised for an extended period, or while working on the machine. introductory agricul ture1072. Never depend on tractor hydraulic pressure to carry harrow weight in transport--use safety lock, and relieve pressure in cylinders. 3. Lower integral harrows to ground each time tractor engine is shut off, and any time harrow is being serviced or repaired. If it must be raised for repairs, securely block the frame to prevent accidental lowering. 4. Lock the tractor drawbar in fixed position when transporting wheeled disks. 5. Never transport a disk harrow on its own wheels at more than normal tractor speed, and considerably less than that on rough or uneven ground. 6. Wear protective gloves when working with or near disk blades. 7. Park or block the harrow so it cannot roll when unhitched. 8. Make sure wings are securely locked in transport position before moving the harrow. 9. Provide adequate tractor ballast for front-end stability and to prevent excessive slippage. 10. Never allow anyone to ride on tractor drawbar or harrow in operation or transport. 11. Stand clear of harrow wings during folding or unfolding and Do not make sharp turns with blades down. F. Field Cultivators 1. Never exceed recommended transport speed for the cultivator used. If speed is not stated, do not exceed maximum tractor speed. 2.

Do not depend on hydraulic pressure to carry the weight. Always lock wings in transport position and relieve pressure in cylinders. 4. Never walk or work under wings when they are in the folded position.Points to remember Care and maintenance of farm implements is very important for their smooth operations and longevity. Agricultural implements mostly work in soil so it is very necessary to clean them properly before their storage for proper operation. Proper care should be taken while using the implements in the field to avoid accident and injury Agricultural implements should be stored at a proper place to protect them from moisture, dust etc. for their longevity Proper care should be taken while transporting the implements on rough ground and road to avoid accidents 1085. Transport width of most field cultivators exceeds normal vehicle width. Therefore, use extreme caution when meeting other vehicles and avoid the possibility of dropping tractor or- implement wheels into holes, drains, or ditches along the road edge. G. Toothed harrows 1. Provide sufficient front-end weight for safe, stable operation and transport. 2. Use widest practical wheel tread to improve tractor stability, especially when working on steep slopes. 3. Reduce implement to narrowest possible width for transport on roads or highways. 4. Lock wings or folded sections securely in place before transporting equipment. 5 Never transport wheeled harrows, harrow carts, or field conditioners at more than tractor transport speeds; transport considerably slower on rough or uneven terrain. 6. Never make sharp turns at high speeds and Never allow anyone to ride on the tractor but the operator. 8. Lower implements to the ground before stopping tractor engine, before servicing or repairing equipment, or at any time the machines are left unattended. h. Packers 1. Provide adequate front-end weight for tractor stability in operation and transport of integral harrows. Use maximum allowable front ballast if operating integral harrows in lower gears. 2. Never exceed normal tractor speed when transporting drawn roller harrows, and drive considerably slower than that on rough or uneven ground. 3. Do not transport roller packers over hard-surfaced roads--use carriers. 4. Never permit anyone but the driver to ride on the tractor. 5. Never permit anyone to ride on the tractor drawbar or implement during operation or transport. 6. Pin tractor drawbar in center before transporting. 7. Never lubricate, adjust, or repair the implement while it is in motion or the tractor engine is running. 8.

Install the transport safety lock and relieve hydraulic pressure in the cylinders when transporting. introductory agricul ture1092. Ensure the wings are securely locked in the folded position before transporting. 3. Never ride or allow others to ride on the machine during operation or transport. Allow only the driver on the tractor. 4. Do not unhitch from the tractor or store the machine with wings in the folded transport position. 5. Never stand with feet under blades while making adjustments or during maintenance. Be extremely careful while working within the implement frame. 6. Do not stand or walk on the plow frame, or under wings when they are folded for transport. J. Rod Weeders 1. Allow only the operator to ride on the tractor during operation and transport. 2. Never permit anyone to ride on the rod weeder. 3. Never exceed recommended transport speed or, if not stated, maximum tractor speed. Reduce speed on rough or uneven terrain or when turning. 4. Never attempt to repair, adjust, or lubricate the rod weeder while it is in motion. 5. Switch off the engine and relieve the hydraulic pressure in hoses before disconnecting them. 6. Never exceed recommended transport speed, or tractor road speed if maximum is not stated. Reduce speed when turning or crossing rough areas and slopes. 7. Always lower equipment or install transport lock before servicing, lubricating or repairing equipment, and when the machine will be left unattended. AGRICUL TURAL PROCESSING Agricultural processing includes those operations which maintain or raise the quality of raw material, change its form, or prepare it for market. Its importance is growing and will continue to increase as farming becomes more commercialized, specialized and mechanized in India. Some of the advantages are: 1. Produce, which is now being wasted because of inadequate transport facilities and excess supply can be preserved and used later. 2. The processing may serve as a small scale industry, providing additional employment facilities for idle labour. 3. Perishable products can be changed to a stable commodity, e.g. canning of fruits, drying of fruits and fodder, making of .silage etc. 4. Products can be prevented from being affected by insects and pests during storage, rendering them completely unusable. 110Some of the processing machines are as follows 1. Grain Cleaner: It is used for cleaning of the grains from the chaff. 2. Fruit and vegetable grader: This machine is used for grading of round shaped fruit and vegetables according to size in three grades (sizes). 3. Dal mill: In India most of the pulses are consumed in dehusked and split form. Thus processing of pulses assumes a lot of importance. Pulses processing industry helps in processing the raw grain legumes/pulses into edible form. Processing activity is undertaken at 3 different levels. This machine is used for preparation of dal. 4. Rice polisher: It is used for polishing of rice to improve its quality. 5. Rice Huller: It is an agricultural machine used to automate the process of removing the chaff (the outer husks) of grains of rice. Points to remember Agricultural processing includes those operations which maintain or raise the quality of raw material, change its form, or prepare it for market. The processing may serve as a small scale industry, providing additional employment facilities for idle labour. Some of the processing machines are Grain Cleaner, Fruit and vegetable grade, Dal mill, Rice polisher and Rice Huller etc. Dal Mill Grain Cleaner Machine Rice hullerintroductory agricul ture111 Fruit and Vegetable Grader STORAGE STRUCTURES Grain storage plays an important role in preventing losses which are caused mainly due to weevils, beetles, moths and rodents. It is estimated that 60-70% of food grain produced in the country is stored at home level in indigenous storage structures. The percentage of overall food crop production retained at the farm-level and the period of storage is largely a function of farm-size and yield per acre, family-size, consumption pattern, marketing pattern, form of labour payment, credit availability and future crop expectations. The storage methods range from mud structures to modern bins. The containers are made from a variety of locally available materials differing in design, shape, size and functions. The materials used include paddy straw, wheat straw, wood, bamboo, reeds, mud, bricks, cow dung etc. Grains can be stored indoors, outdoor or at underground level. Indoor storage involves grain containment in structures like Kanaja, Kothi, Sanduka and earthern pots. Kanaja is a grain storage container made out of bamboo. The base is usually round and has a wide opening at the top. The height varies. The Kanaja is plastered with mud and cow dung mixture to prevent spillage and pilferage of grains. The top is also plastered with mud and cow dung mixture or covered with paddy straw or gunny bags. Wooden boxes, also called as Sanduka, are used for storing pulses, seeds and smaller quantities of grains. These boxes have a storage capacity of 3-12 quintals. In some cases, partition is also made inside the box to store two to three types of grains. A big lid on the top with a small opening enables taking out the grains. To protect the grains from moisture, the box is kept 12 inches above the ground level with the help of stands/legs. The box has to be regularly polished for its maintenance. Kothi is used to store paddy and jowar. A room is constructed with a large door for pouring grains. A small outlet is made for taking out the grains. Earthen pots are indoor storage containers for storing small quantity of grains. These are made locally using burnt clay and are of different shapes and sizes. The earthen pots are placed at the floor level. They are arranged one above the other and known as dokal.112In addition to small scale storage there are structures for large scale storage of grains. Large scale grain storage is done in CAP and silos. CAP Storage (Cover and Plinth) involves the construction of brick pillars to a height of 14\" from the ground, with grooves into which wooden crates are fixed for the stacking of bags of food grains. The stacks are covered with 250 micron LDPE sheets from the top and all four sides. Food grains such as wheel, maize, gram, paddy, and sorghum are generally stored in CAP (cover and plinth) storage for 6-12 month periods. It is the most economical storage structure and is being widely used for bagged grains. The structure can be fabricated in less than 3 weeks. It is an economical way of storage on a large scale. In addition, different types of storage structures are required on the farm to store grain, seed, fodder, fertilizers, vegetables, etc. as described below. Silo: It is a farm structure used for storage of animal fodder so that it is preserved in an ideal condition for animals. The animal fodder is cut and packed in the air tight silo to allow partial fermentation to occur. The storage fodder is called as silage. Food Grain Storage Structures After threshing of grain the grain should be stored safely so as to save it from insects, pests, rodents, moisture etc. A good storage structure should provide protection from insects, rodents, birds, mites etc., should proper aeration and fumigation when required, should prevent losses due to temperature and moisture and it should be economical. Some of the storage structures are as given below. 1. Bukhari type 2. Kothar type 3. Morai type 4. Grain bins 5.

Explain principles involved in organic and natural farming and its advantages. Understand the importance of Mushrooms and Backyard poultry hIGh YIELDING VARIETIES (hYVs) High-yielding varieties (HYVs) are genetically improved cultivars of crops having increased growth rate, increased percentage of usable plant parts or an increased resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. Such HYVs have been developed in crop plants using science of genetics and plant breeding and their yield potential has been optimized using better agronomical practices. Because of high yield potential of HYVs, the yield of wheat and rice increased significantly in many countries including India during the 1970s. Such HYVs, therefore, formed the basis for the Green Revolution. The term Green Revolution was used in 1968 by William Gaud to describe significant increase in wheat and rice production and productivity due to deployment of HYVs. In fact, the Green Revolution refers to a series of research and development, and technology transfer initiatives, occurring between the 1940s and the late 1960s, which increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in the developing world, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s. The initiatives, led by Nobel Laureate Norman Borlaug, the \"Father of the Green Revolution\" credited with saving over a billion people from starvation, involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers. In general, HYVs require a higher level of agricultural care, such as intensive disease control, higher fertilizer levels and ensured water supply. While HYVs of different crops have enabled many fold increase in agricultural production, their increased demands of fertilizers, pesticides and water control have drawn criticism from environmentalists. India became one of the world's most successful wheat and rice producers after the deployment of dwarf HYVs, and has become an exporter of rice and wheat from net importer country. introductory agricul ture115 Dwarf high Yielding Varieties of Wheat Dwarf high Yielding Varieties of Rice high yielding varieties of different crops S.No. Crop hYVs 1.

The main explanation of the difference in yield between high-yielding and traditional varieties is the increased rate in which primary plant products is redirected to harvestable products, such as grains. b) Dwarfness The HYVs of wheat and rice are dwarf or semi-dwarf in terms of plant height. Due to short height, stem of HYVs remains to be stronger and can withstand strong winds. Thus, the problem of lodging in traditional tall varieties of wheat and rice associated with application of nitrogenous fertilizers and good management is minimized with the deployment of dwarf HYVs as these varieties respond to higher management practices with much higher yield without lodging. c) Better Responsiveness to Fertilizers The HYVs are better responsive to fertilizers. This means that when fertilizers are supplied to HYVs, their yield increases substantially. However, when high fertilizers are applied in traditional varieties of wheat and rice grown prior to Green Revolution, they grow taller and lodged without any additional yield advantage. d) Earliness The HYVs are also early in maturity when compared with traditional varieties. Because of early maturity, more number of crops can be accommodated on the same piece of land and time. This will further increase in better and efficient utilization of land resources and farmers' can earn more income from same piece of land. ORGANIC AGRICUL TUREOrganic agriculture is a production system that sustains the health of soils, ecosystems and people. It relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects. Organic agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved. introductory agricul ture117Organic agriculture concept in India is not new rather it is practiced since long back. This farming method primarily aimed at cultivating the land and raising crops in such a way that the soil remains alive and in good health by use of crop residues, animal and farm wastes, aquatic wastes (organic wastes) and other biological materials along with beneficial microbes. Such organic and biological materials will ensure the nutritional requirements of crops, sustain crop productivity and maintain soil health in an eco friendly pollution free environment. Vegetable Produced through Organic Farming Principles of Organic Agriculture Principle of health: Organic agriculture sustains and enhances the health of soil, plant, animal, human and planet as one and indivisible. Principle of ecology: Organic agriculture is based on living ecological systems and cycles; it works with, emulates and helps sustain them. Principle of fairness: Organic agriculture builds on relationships that ensure fairness with regard to the common environment and life opportunities. Principle of care: Organic agriculture is managed in a precautionary and responsible manner to protect the health and well-being of current and future generations and the environment. Components of Organic Farming Crop Rotation : It is a systematic arrangement of growing different crops in a more or less regular sequence on the same land covering a period of two years or more. Through crop rotations, soil fertility, weeds, insects and diseases are managed without any chemical inputs. Crop Residue : In India there is a great potential for utilization of crop residues/ straw of some of the major cereals and pulses. About 50% of the crop residues are utilized as animal feed, the rest could be very well utilized for recycling of nutrients with the help of efficient microbial inoculants. Organic Manure : The organic manure is derived from biological sources like plant, animal and human residues. Organic manure act in many ways in augmenting crop growth and soil productivity. a) Bulky Organic Manure: It generally contains less amounts of plant nutrients as compared to concentrated organic manure. It includes farm yard manure (FYM), compost and green manure.118 FYM: It refers to the well-decomposed mixture of dung, urine, farm litter and left over or used up materials from roughages or fodder fed to the cattle. Compost: Large quantities of waste material are available as vegetable refuse, farm litter, such as weeds, stubble, straw, sugarcane trash, sewage sludge and animal waste in houses and in areas like human and industrial refuse; therefore, excreta can be converted into useful compost manure by conserving and subjecting these to a controlled process of anaerobic decomposition. Compost is used in the same way as FYM and is good for application to all soils and all crops. Green Manuring: It is a practice of ploughing or turning into the soil un-decomposed green plant tissues for the purpose of improving physical structure as well as fertility of the soil. The most commonly used green Concentrated organic manures are those materials that are organic in nature and contain higher percentage of essential plant nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous and potash, as compared to bulky organic manures. These concentrated manures are made from raw materials of animal or plant origin. The concentrated organic manures commonly used are oilcakes, blood meal, fishmeal, meat meal and horn and hoof meal. Waste as Organic Manures Industrial waste: Among the industrial by-products, spent wash from ditilisers and molasses and pressmud from sugar industry have good manurial value. Addition of decomposed pressmud improves the soil fertility and enhances the activity of microbes. Coir waste is the by-product from coir industry and can be used as manure after proper decomposition. Municipal and Sewage waste: It also forms an important component of organic waste. Sewage sludge particularly from industrialized cities is contaminated with heavy metals and these pose hazards to plants, animals and human beings. Thus, toxic waste should be separated at the source to minimize the concentration of such elements in the sludge. Biofertilizers Bio-fertilizer is microorganism's culture capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen when suitable crops are inoculated with them. The main inputs are microorganisms, which are capable of mobilizing nutritive elements from non-usable form to usable form through biological introductory agricul ture119process. These are less expensive, eco-friendly and sustainable. The Biofertilizers containing biological nitrogen fixing organism are more important in agriculture. Bio-fertilizers may be of two types: Symbiotic N-fixation where Rhizobium culture of various strains is used. Rhizobium culture multiplies in the roots of legume crops and fixes nitrogen symbiotically. Asymbiotic N-fixation with help of Azotobacter, Azospirillium, Blue Green Algae, Azolla and Mycorrhizae. They grow on decomposing soil organic matter and produce nitrogen compounds. Bio-pesticide Bio-pesticides are natural plant products that belong to the so-called secondary metabolites, which include thousands of alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics and minor secondary chemicals and are effective against many insects, nematodes, fungi etc. Neem-( Azadirachta indica) is one of the botanical pesticides used widely. In fact, all parts of the Neem tree possess insecticidal property but seed kernel is most active. Some other commonly used botanical insecticides are indicates, vermicompost- organic manure is produced by the activity of earthworms. Vermicomposting is a method of making compost with the use of earthworms that generally live in soil, eat biomass and excrete it in digested form. These are rich in macro and micronutrients, vitamins, growth hormones and immobilized microflora. Weed ManagementIn organic farming, weeds are managed by promoting crop competition and phytotoxic effects on weeds. Organic farmers integrate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and chemical tactics to manage weeds without synthetic herbicides. Mechanical and physical weed control practices used on organic farms can be broadly grouped as: Tillage - Turning the soil between crops to incorporate crop residues and soil amendments; remove existing weed growth and prepare a seedbed for planting; turning soil after seeding to kill weeds, including cultivation of row crops Mowing and cutting - Removing top growth of weeds Flame weeding and thermal weeding - Using heat to kill weeds Mulching - Blocking weed emergence with organic materials, plastic films, or landscape fabric. 120Live Stock Raising livestock and poultry, for meat, dairy and eggs with natural living conditions and feed is another traditional farming activity that complements organic agriculture. Genetically modified cropsOrganic agriculture does not allow any genetically modified (GM) organisms in farming system. Benefits of Organic Farming It helps in maintaining environment health by reducing the level of pollution It reduces human and animal health hazards by reducing the level of undesirable and toxic residues in the product. It helps in keeping agricultural production at a higher level and makes it sustainable. It reduces the cost of agricultural production and also improves the soil health It ensures optimum utilization of natural resources for short-term benefit and helps in conserving them for future generation. It not only saves energy for both animal and machine, but also reduces risk of crop failure. It improves the soil physical properties such as granulation, and good tilth, good aeration, easy root penetration and improves water-holding capacity. It improves the soil's chemical properties such as supply and retention of soil nutrients, and promotes favorable chemical reactions. NATURAL FARMING Natural farming is an ecological farming approach established by Masanobu Fukuoka (1913-2008), a Japanese farmer and philosopher, introduced in his book 'The One-Straw Revolution' in 1975. It is also referred to as \"the Fukuoka Method\", \"the natural way of farming\" or \"do- nothing farming\". Natural farming is related to fertility farming, organic farming, sustainable agriculture, agroforestry, ecoagriculture and permaculture but should be distinguished from biodynamic agriculture. The most essential aspect of natural farming is to let nature play a dominant role to the maximum extent possible. Hence, no-till, farm biodiversity, integration and symbiotic farm components and protection of soil cover all have a place in this method of farming. The immense importance placed on no-tillage has led to natural farming also being referred to as No-till farming. The term 'Do Nothing Farming' originated because the farmer is considered only to be a facilitator - the real work is done by Nature herself. In natural farming, actual physical work and labour is reduced drastically in comparison to other agricultural systems.introductory agricul ture121 In India, natural farming is often referred to as \"Rishi Kheti\" which includes ancient vedic principles of farming based on the use of animal waste and herbs for controlling pests and cow products like buttermilk, milk, cure and its waste urine for preparing growth promoters. The Rishi or Vedic farming is regarded as non -violent farming without any usage of chemical fertilizer and pesticides. Principally, natural farming minimizes human labour and intervention and adopts, as closely as practical, nature's production of foods. Natural Farming GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS Genetically modified (GM) or biotech crops are improved cultivars developed using biotechnological procedures and defined as plants whose genetic material has been artificially modified by addition or deletion of gene in laboratory using genetic engineering/ recombinant DNA technology. Power of genetic engineering/recombinant DNA technology has facilitated the transfer of gene (s) from taxonomically different organism such as plant, animal, bacterial and viral genes or even gene synthesized in laboratory. This kind of genetic modification or gene transfer is not possible in nature or through traditional crossbreeding methods. The gene used for modifying plant genome for development of GM crops is called transgene, if the gene is taken from the organism which is not crossable to target plant species. The crystal protein (cry) genes isolated from bacterium- Bacillus thuringiensis and transferred into many plant species including cotton and maize is an excellent example of transgene. Crop plants modified with such gene (s) are called transgenic crop or genetically modified or biotech crops. The other possibility of GM crops is the modification of plant genome in the laboratory using gene from same or from a crossable species. Such gene (s) is called cisgene and the plant genome modified using cisgene is referred as cisgenic crop. In India, Bt-cotton namely MECH-12, MECH-162 and MECH-184 were released for cultivation in 2002. The Bt GM cotton hybrids were consisted of a gene cry1Ac isolated from bacterium - Bacillus thuringiensis. Other GM crops include gene for herbicide tolerance, disease resistance, male sterility and fertility, quality improvement transferred in many crops122The methods used successfully in development of GM crops are biological or vector mediated using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and physical or non-vector mediated using gene gun. Need of GM Crops Creating plants better resistant to weeds, pest and other diseases (Herbicide, diseases and insect pest tolerance). Higher yields to create more efficient use of land, less uses of herbicides and other pesticides (Herbicide and insect tolerance). Foods with better texture, flavor and nutritional value (Ama1 gene based GM crop, Amflora potato variety). Foods with a longer shelf life for easier shipping (Flavr SavrTM tomato). GM foods can create an essential sustainable way to feed the world. Inducing male sterility and fertility restoration system for hybrid seed production (Barnase and barstar gene from bacterium). Fulfilling the requirements of desirable gene (s) not present in the species (Crystal protein (Cry) genes from bacterium to plants). Introduction of novel traits (Ex. Golden rice, Bt cotton). Safety Issues in GM Crops Developments of GM crops are growing at rapid rate using gene from diverse sources including gene from bacterium, viruses and other microbes etc and the fate of protein/enzyme in the host system is not known. Thus, it becomes necessary to ensure safety of human being and other living organisms, environment and natural resources with the cultivation and consumption of GM crops. A set of procedures and guidelines collectively called biosafety regulations are used to ensure safety about GM crops. India has a well-defined regulatory mechanism for development and evaluation of genetically modified organism (GMO) and the products thereof. The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF) are the two apex regulatory bodies regulating the research, development and commercialization of GM crops in India. PROTECTED CUL TIVATION Protected cultivation can be defined as a cropping technique wherein the micro climate surrounding the plant body is controlled partially or fully to maintain optimum conditions for better growth and development of crops. Under protected cultivation, crops are grown inside a framed structure that will protect the crop from environmental extremes, excess rainfall, wind, insects-pests on one hand and on the other it create environmental conditions that is more conducive for plant growth and development. The crop yield under protected introductory agricul ture123cultivation is much higher than the crop yield when grown under open environmental conditions. Moreover, quality of the product under protected cultivation is also better. With the advancement of agriculture, various types of protected cultivation practices suitable for a specific agro-climatic zone have been developed to maximize production. Green house, plastic house, net house, shade house, trench tunnels etc are common forms of protected structure used in India. Commercial glass greenhouses are often having high-tech production facilities for vegetables or flowers and for nursery raising. The glass greenhouses are filled with equipments which automatically maintain optimum temperatures, humidity and light required for proper growth and development of crops. In hilly areas in general and higher hills in particular, climatic conditions especially temperatures during winter season remains extremely adverse for crop cultivation. In such areas, protected structure can be used effectively for successful cultivation of high value low volume crops such as vegetables, flowers etc. Thus, crop cultivation under protected environment can ensure availability of fresh vegetables locally for highlanders as well armed forces posted in such far-flung hilly tracts at least during the winter season when cultivation of crops under open field are difficult. Cultivation of Vegetable under Protected Environment Advantages of Protected Cultivation Cultivation of crops under controlled conditions has many advantages. These advantages may be in terms of higher productivity per unit of land, water and other resources or in terms of better control over diseases and pests with reduced application of chemicals or ensuring cultivation during the vegetables and flowering plants, raising early nursery of horticultural crops, ensures availability of fresh perishables during winter in hilly areas, off-season cultivation of crops, hardening of plants derived from tissue culture etc.124Nursery raising Hardening of plants Better Control of pests Better Control of Diseases Reduces pesticides useBetter use of resourcesOff season cultivationHigher productivityBetter quality Advantages of Protected Cultivation MUShROOM PRODUCTION Mushrooms are large reproductive structure edible fungi, a group of organism separate from plant and animals. They can be seen growing on tree stumps, soil etc. specially during the rainy seasons, were plenty of dead organic matter is available. The vegetative part of mushroom mainly consists of thread like structures (mycelium). They absorb their nutrition with the help of mycelium is penetrate into the substrate and generally not visible above the ground. After the mycelium has grown and absorb sufficient food materials it forms reproductive structures which generally come out of the ground or from rotting materials forms fruit bodies (sporocarps) which we commonly refer to as mushroom. In some kind of mushrooms fruiting bodies are formed underground e.g. Tuber sp. Mushroom vary in size, shape and color. Some mushrooms are deadly poisonous e.g. Amanita muscaria. It needs a lot of experience and knowledge to differentiate between poisonous and edible wild mushroom. They are used for various purposes e.g. as food, medicine, intoxicants, dye etc. More than 2000 species of fungi are edible throughout the world about 280 are reported from India. Large number of naturally occurring edible fungi are eaten by tribal and hill people after collection from wild habitats. Twenty edible species are cultivated in the world out of which 6-7 species are produced in sufficient quantity. introductory agricul ture125 View of Button Mushroom Cultivation Cultivated mushrooms are safe for consumption. They are considered as delicacy. Mushrooms are rich in protein, vitamins and minerals while low in carbohydrate and fat content which makes them suitable for diabetic and heart patient. Some mushrooms can be easily grown for food and profit. The country at present has almost the lowest per capita consumption of protein amongst the developed countries. Mushroom production is useful for production of protein rich food obtained from agricultural/industrial wastes which are available in sufficient quantity. Besides it grows independent of sunlight, feed on organic matter and does not require fertile soil. In addition to floor, air space is also utilized resulting in higher productivity per unit area. Mushroom cultivation is an important segment of integrated farming system. It is a profitable agro business particularly for small and marginal farmers, landless laborers, unemployed youth and entrepreneurs. Mushroom cultivation involves simple and easy to adopt technology. Agricultural waste or byproducts of agriculture/industry like paddy straw, wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse, hulled maize crops, cotton wastes etc. can be used as substrate. A number of marginal, small and industrial mushroom farm units have been established in the countries. Marginal farmers are seasonal growers and grow 1 - 3 crops in temporary huts. Whereas industrial growers grow mushrooms under controlled conditions round the year. In India mainly Agaricus bisporus (white button or European or Temperate mushrooms), Pleurotus sp. (Oyster or Dhingri mushroom), Volvariella sp. (Chinese or tropical or paddy straw mushroom) and Lentinus edodes (shiitake mushroom) are commercial cultivated. They 126grow in a variety of climatic condition and on various types of substrates. Details are given in Table Table : Growth conditions of major mushrooms grown in India.

These birds are very popular due to their adaptability to local agro-climatic conditions and management practices with prominent brooding behaviour and mothering ability. But these birds are small in size, poor in egg production (50-60 eggs/annum), with small clutch size thus making them not suitable for commercial exploitation in backyard production system. Most of the indigenous chicken breeds like Kadaknath and Nicobari fowls are common in tribal areas of their origin. Among native breeds, Aseel has special place in Indian culture as these birds are specially bred for cock fighting. They have heavy body size, long shanks, endurance and aggressive behaviour. Inspite of the fact that backyard poultry is the most neglected one, still contributing nearly 30% to the national egg pool and their eggs and meat fetching a much higher price than that from commercial poultry. The commercial poultry sector is doing business, through integrated approach of contract farming using high-input and high-output birds. For the poorest of the poor and the landless, the major issues are food security and risk spreading through subsidiary income, which are not addressed by the private commercial sector. Backyard poultry requiring hardly any infrastructure set-up is a potent tool for upliftment of the poorest of the poor. Besides income generation, backyard poultry provides nutritional and livelihood security in the form of valuable animal protein and supplementary income. Thus there is a need to take up specific rural poultry production programs, to meet the requirements of the rural consumers while introductory agricul ture127constituting a source of subsistence income as a subsidiary occupation by taking up colored bird units ranging from 20 to 50 birds per family in their backyards. Such units require very little hand feeding and can give a fairly handsome return with bare minimum night shelters. Improved Breeds for Backyard Alleviates protein malnutrition in vulnerable groups viz. expectant women, feeding mothers and children. Controls pests by utilizing wastes like insects, ants, fallen grains, green grass, herbs/shrubs, kitchen waste, vegetable waste etc. and convert them into egg and chicken meat for human consumption. Minimizes environmental pollution per unit poultry produce, which is otherwise a major problem with the intensive poultry farming. Provides additional income to the rural households (women). Integrates well with other farming operations. Aids in enhancing the soil fertility in backyards (15 chickens produce 1-1.2 kg of manure/ day) Produce of rural poultry farming fetches high price compared to those produced from intensive poultry. Eggs and meat from birds reared under free range conditions have low cholesterol concentration compared to those produced under intensive poultry farming. Generate self employment opportunity in rural areas and help in checking migration of people to urban areas. Provides egg and meat with almost no or meager investment through backyard poultry farming in free range system. Require no big infrastructure ChECK YOUR PROGRESS Q1.
