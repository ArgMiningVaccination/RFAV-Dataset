As the centrifugal force increases, the heavy spot pulls up and down on the suspension, making the beads move in the opposite direction of the downward and upward motion, through inertia. The beads continue to migrate until the complete wheel assembly is balanced. Improve Fuel Economy A complete wheel assembly balanced with EcoBalance will run with reduced rolling resistance. This reduction in rolling resistance means less energy is used to move the vehicle down the road, and therefore improving the vehicle's fuel economy. Increase Tire Life A complete wheel assembly balanced with EcoBalance reduces rolling resistance. This in turn, reduces tire wear. When a tire and complete wheel assembly is properly balanced, it also ensures a more even wear, all of which increases tire life. Increased tire life allows you to use the same tires longer, ultimately saving you money. Reduce Vibrations Wheel vibrations can wreak havoc on a vehicles suspension and steering parts. Anything that is vibrating is rubbing up or bumping into something that will eventually wear out because of it. Once you have balanced the wheel assembly completely, with EcoBalance Beads you will find that most things that are attached to it won't wear out nearly as quickly. Eco Friendly EcoBalance Beads are made of reusable and recyclable 99.9% tempered glass spheres. Our balancing beads are installed inside the tire, where they won't get knocked off and contaminate the environment like lead weights can.
