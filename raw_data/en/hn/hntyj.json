Since NYU School of Medicine was officially founded in 1841, our physicians and researchers have made discoveries that have revolutionized the practice of medicine. They have set new standards for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and have continuously pushed the boundaries of knowledge and science. And they have shown an unwavering commitment to training future generations of physicians, many of whom went on to make groundbreaking discoveries and bring medical advances to patients all over the globe. Pioneering Medicine ighlights just some of the great number of contributions that our doctors, scientists, and alumni have made throughout history. Today, NYU Langone Medical Center's physicians and researchers are committed to building upon this outstanding legacy of discovery and service. As we set out to advance medical education, scientific research, and patient care, we look to these illustrious pioneers as a source of inspiration, gratitude, and pride. Robert I.

Valentine Mott, John William Draper, Granville S. Pattison, Gunning S.

FOUNDER (noun) \"one who sets or grounds on something solid, who takes the first steps in building\"12 FOUNDERSVAlENT iNEMOTTThe most famous American surgeon of his day, Valentine Mott began teaching surgery at Columbia College at the age of 26 and in 1818 performed the first successful ligature of the innominate artery, a procedure considered the most formidable operation of that day. He left Columbia to become one of the founding faculty of the University of New York's Medical Department in 1841. He was legendary for his knowledge and teaching of anatomy, and stu - dents and professors from all parts of the United States and abroad came to observe his work in the operating theater at Bellevue Hospital. Mott initiated the \"clinique\" as a teaching method, bringing patients into the operating theater to present their ailments to the medical students, followed by a discussion of causes and demonstration of appropriate treatment. This emphasis on actual patients and treatment, in addition to theoretical study of texts and abstract anatomy, helped revolutionize the teach - ing of medicine. Mott also introduced the use of individual patient history charts at every hos - pital bedside, and his four-volume translation of Velpeau's Operative Surgery (1847) became the 19th-century surgeon's bible. In 1849, by unanimous vote, Mott was elected to the presidency of the New York Academy of Medicine.

His highly regarded textbook, Human Physiology, Statical and Dynamical (1856), argued for a strictly chemical basis of life, rather than following the dominant vital force theory, whose proponents claimed that living systems contained a nonchemical force that gave them life. An early pioneer in photography, Draper produced, with Samuel F.B. Morse, the first daguerreotype portraits by an American. The two taught photography at the University of New York and counted Mathew Brady, the famed photojournalist, among their students. Draper made the first photograph of the moon to show its features (1840), and the first photographic plate of the solar spectrum (1843). He was also one of the first to take photographs of specimens under a microscope. Draper helped found the American Chemical Society in 1876 and served as its first president.

He was indicted, but acquitted, for body-snatching as a 23-year-old instructor in anatomy in Glasgow, and lobbied the House of Commons in favor of the Anatomy Act, which passed in 1832, legal - izing the use of cadavers for anatomical study in Britain. Before coming to New York, he practiced and taught in Glasgow (where he helped found the Glasgow Medical Society in 1814), London, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. While in Baltimore, he helped establish the Baltimore Infirmary, one of the first modern teaching hospitals in the United States, now known as the University of Maryland Medical Center. In 1941 Pattison came to New York at Valentine Mott's invitation to join the inaugural faculty of the new Department of Medicine of the University of New York. His support for human dissection as an essential tool in the study of medi - cine, and for teaching in a clinical setting, signifi - cantly contributed to the medicine of his day. \"...he (Pattison) almost made the dead body before him speak...His success in fortifying the student in the knowledge...to make free and bold incisions...made him one of the most successful lecturers that ever adorned a medical college.\" \u2014stuDent D escribing p attison's anato My class this page : Cover of the Annual Announcement of Lectures for the Medical Department of the University of New York, for the 1841-42 session, the first aca - demic year of the new medical school. opposite page, F roM top : A biography of Pattison, by his great-great-great nephew, F.

His textbooks, Diseases of Women and Children (which went through ten editions during his lifetime) and Principles and Practice of Obstetrics (five edi - tions), were widely adopted by medical schools in the United States and Britain, and were trans - lated into French and German. He designed and introduced the Bedford forceps in 1846, to assist in deliveries. Bedford opened the first obstetrical clinic for indigent women in the United States, where as many as ten thousand women received care each year without charge. His promotion of safe obstetric procedures and his instruction to stu - dents helped raise the existing standard of care for women.

He received a clas - sical education at Harvard and studied medicine there with Dr. James Jackson. He also studied in Paris and graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1811. Revere practiced medicine in Boston and Baltimore, and helped found the University of New York's Medical Department in 1841, where he taught the Theory and Practice of Medicine. He died just six years later, the victim of typhus contracted in the course of attending a sick medical student. Highly re - garded by his peers, Revere was eulogized by Valentine Mott in Biographical Memoir of the Late John Revere, M.D. \"Both as a physician and as a man, (Revere) was a model gentleman...

AD V O C ATES ADVOCATES | Promoting Health and Healing Around the WorldAs they better understood the biological basis of disease through the 19th and 20th centuries, the doctors and scientists of NYU's medical school and Bellevue Hospital's medical school increasingly turned their attention to its causes and prevention, in addition to its treatment. They advocated for sanitation, both urban and personal, and worked to eliminate breeding sites for disease and its carriers. They championed the development of vaccination, quarantine, record keeping, and other methods of minimizing the spread of disease, transforming the landscape and expectations of public health, a transformation that continues into the 21st century.

Van Buren declined appointment as surgeon general of the Army, but helped organize the publication of a series of monographs for use by Army surgeons. Among these was his Rules for Preserving the Health of the Soldier , which was published in 1861. His text - books on surgical procedures included Contributions to Practical Surgery (1865) and Lectures on the Principles of Surgery (1884). After the war, Van Buren served as a founding member of New York City's Council of Hygiene and Public Health.

He wrote Amputations for the United States Sanitary Commission , and his Handbook of Surgical Operations is said to have been issued to every Union army surgeon throughout the Civil War. In his 90s, Smith was appointed president of the Department of Charities, where he initiated reforms which outraged Tammany Hall and resulted in his dismissal \"for the good of the service,\" which Smith regarded as a great tribute to his efforts. \"Nuisances dangerous to life and detrimental to health existed everywhere.

In 1907 Baker was made assistant commissioner of health, and she was instrumental in help - ing track down and quarantine \"Typhoid Mary,\" an asymptomatic carrier of typhoid whose cooking had unwittingly infected dozens of New Yorkers.Baker was appointed director of the city's new Bureau of Child Hygiene in 1908, and developed programs for midwife training, basic hygiene, and preventive care. She expanded the city's school nurse pro - gram, home visits by city nurses to new mothers, well baby and milk distribution stations throughout the city, and the Little Mothers' Leagues to teach young girls how to care for their infant siblings while their moth - ers went out to work. During her tenure, between 1908 and 1914, the mortality rate for children under one year dropped more than 40 per - cent.

A pioneer in open-heart surgery, Spencer introduced at Bellevue Hospital techniques devel - oped by John W. Kirklin at Mayo Clinic that successfully used a Gibbon-type pump-oxy - genator to maintain circulation during surgery. What was originally a highly risky surgery became an almost routine procedure, and Bellevue Hospital became a national center for open-heart surgery. Spencer's seminal work on coronary artery bypass grafting and other techniques helped form the foundation of modern-day cardiac surgery. Spencer also made important contributions in general cardiothoracic surgery (including reoperative surgery), surgery for congenital heart disease, valvular heart surgery, thoracic aneurysm and experi - ments with artificial hearts.

New York City has always been at the forefront of educational progress, promoting scientific investigation and even licensing the first medical school for women. NYU's medical school was among the first to initiate an M.D. /Ph.D. program, and today it is redefining itself yet again, to create a uniquely integrated program in which patient care, research, and education work together synergistically to the benefit of all.TEACHER (noun) one who imparts knowledge or guides in the study of a subject or acquisition of a skill. on the PR eVIoUS PAG e: A clinic in the operating theater, c.1880.60 TEACHERS61 TEACHERSlOOM iSAlFRED lEBBEUS A promising young physician whose career was interrupted when he developed tuberculosis, Loomis took on diseases of the lungs and heart as his specialty. He was appointed visiting physician to Bellevue Hospital in 1859 and became professor of the theory and practice of medicine in the Medical Department of the University of the City of New York in 1866. When the medical department's building burned in May of that same year, it was largely due to Loomis's efforts that the school continued to grow steadily. The Loomis Laboratory, built in 1888, was named in recognition of his work.

As dean of the New York University College of Medicine from 1932 to 1937, Wyckoff guided it through the Depression and reorganized its divisions. Wyckoff played an important role in the ad - mission of Jewish students fleeing Nazi Europe, encouraging liberal admission policies for these applicants, in contrast to other schools. This resulted in at least one-half of NYU students being Jewish between 1920 and 1940. A distinguished cardiologist, Wyckoff made the Bellevue Cardiac Clinic a mod - el for other hospitals and introduced the idea of a three-fold cardiac diagnosis\u2014etiological, anatomical, and physiological\u2014which became the standard diagnostic nomenclature.

This search was interrupted by World War II, during which he served with the U.S. Army Epidemiological Board's Virus Committee, developing vaccines for encephalitis (sleeping sickness), sand-fly fever, and dengue fever. Returning to Cincinnati after the war, Sabin developed the first live-virus vaccine for polio, which not only prevented most of the complications of polio, as Salk's vaccine had done, but prevented the initial intestinal infection as well, breaking the chain of transmission.

He discovered (independently of Dr. Ulrich Wolf) the genetic error on chromosome 4 responsible for a rare birth defect characterized by severe growth retardation, mental deficiency, facial and heart defects, and other malformations. This disorder was subsequently named Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. In 1966 Hirschhorn began a four-decade-long association with Mount Sinai, where he established a new medical genetics program patterned on his efforts at NYU School of Medicine. In 1969 he co-founded the first program in genetic counseling in the U.S. at Sarah Lawrence College, which has trained half of the nation's genetic counselors. Hirschhorn received the 2006 March of Dimes/Colonel Harland Sanders Award for lifetime achievement in the field of genetic sciences. opposite page: Portrait of Kurt Hirschhorn circa 1960. this page, F roM top: The WHSC1 gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3.
