From jewelry to decoration to facial rollers and Gua Sha (the heart in middle is intended as a Gua Sha facial massager), these gemstones can uplift the spirit and bring its owner a deeper sense of spiritual health. To me, they are not just a 'Millennial Fad.' When I was a little girl I loved the crystals that I collected and knew that they were special. Now, I always have a rose quartz frog as a paper holder on my desk and a shell filled with crystals that I look at throughout the day, which I find to be spiritually uplifting. I sometimes meditate with a rose quartz in hand. If you also find crystals uplifting, but have yet to familiarize yourself about the benefits of crystals, the task for you is identifying which crystals speak to you and why. For me, my three favorite crystal types are Labradorite, Rose Quartz, and Clear Quartz. I've included the meaning/symbolism of the three below. Furthermore, there are numerous crystals that you can identify with beyond those colors: there is Amethyst, Tiger Eye, Citrine, Jasper, Obsidian... There is something for everyone! It may not be the ascribed meaning to a certain crystal that speaks to you, rather the color or shape that speaks to you, and that's totally fine! There is a special connection between your Zodiac sign, the moon, and your birthstone. However, that can be your jumping off point in how your learn about which crystals speak to you. There are myriad reasons why you may connect well with a particular stone(s). Crystals are meant to help your cleanse, refresh, and center your energies, so that can be any combination of stones for you. I think you can't go wrong when you start familiarizing yourself more with crystals, there is only good to be had with nature's wondrous gifts. Ideally, a deeper sense of appreciation and connectedness to your life force will be part of your journey with identifying your favorite crystals. Enjoy your gemstone journey! Labradorite Labradorite is considered a tremendously spiritual stone, especially helpful for people who tend to overwork. It helps an individual regain energy while aiding the body and spirit in healing itself. In the metaphysical world, labradorite is considered one of the most powerful protectors. The gemstone creates a shield for auras and protects against negativity of the world. Labradorite is said to temper the negativity within ourselves as well. Labradorite is known for its changing colors, so it is no surprise this gemstone is known as a stone of transformation, enhancing strength of will and inner worth. The gemstone labradorite is said to stimulate the throat chakra. Though not associated with any zodiac sign, supposedly the sign of Cancer is especially drawn to labradorite. Rose Quartz Rose Quartz is the stone of universal love. It restores trust and harmony in relationships, encouraging unconditional love. Rose Quartz purifies and opens the heart at all levels to promote love, self-love, friendship, deep inner healing and feelings of peace. Calming and reassuring, it helps to comfort in times of grief. Rose Quartz dispels negativity and protects against environmental pollution, replacing it with loving vibes. It encourages self forgiveness and acceptance invoking self trust and self worth. Clear Quartz Clear Quartz is the most popular and versatile healing stone of all the crystals. It is the most powerful healing stone thought to be able to work on any condition. It is known as the stone of power and amplifies any energy or intention. It is said to protects against negativity, connecting you to your higher self. Clear Quartz is known as the \"master healer\" and will amplify energy and thought, as well as the effect of other crystals. It absorbs, stores, releases and regulates energy. It balances and revitalises the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual planes. It aids concentration and unlocks memory. Stimulates the immune system and brings the body into balance. Clear Quartz (Crystal Quartz, Rock Crystal) harmonizes all the chakras and aligns the subtle bodies. "}
