The Occult and Curative power of Precious Stones by Dr. Fernie originally published in 1913 contains hundreds of pages of quotations from ancient writings about the curative powers of gems and crystals. In the introduction, for example, he records, \"Galen records that the Egyptian King Nechepsus wore a green jasper cut into the shape of a dragon surrounded with rays, which being thus applied over the region of his digestive organs was found to be wonderfully strengthening to their functions.\" The book is replete with stories from Rome, Greece, Ancient Egypt, Persia, and even more remote civilizations in which the curative powers of gems and crystals served to alleviate illness and infirmities. Now of course it is critical to understand and accept that modern medicine offers us powerful knowledge and treatments to cure illness. We live in very fortuitous times and we at the Crystal Vaults encourage everyone to avail themselves of the wonders that are now available to us to cure illness and prolong life. With that said, however, we all know that our bodies are Energy as well as Matter. When our energy is in balance we are generally well. When our energy is out of balance, we are ill. It is this energy imbalance that can be adjusted with the right application of the power within crystals. As an adjunct to modern medicine we can use the power of natural crystals to rebalance and unblock our energy state. The Crystal Vaults offers all natural, cleansed healing crystals for use in natural energy balancing. All of these crystals are examined and certified as pure, natural crystals by our Staff Graduate Gemologist. There are many excellent sources for using these crystals in a variety of healing practices. We particularly recommend [Healing with Crystals & Chakra Energies](https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Crystals-Chakra-Energies-Simon/dp/0681104104) by Sue and Simon Lilly. It contains over 600 photographs and is a true wealth of knowledge for practitioners of crystal healing \u2014 both beginners and experts. Unfortunately, it is out of print, but there are usually used one available. Another excellent source is [Crystal Medicine](https://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Medicine-More-Crystals-New/dp/1567182585/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1206310475&sr=1-1) by Marguerite Elsbeth. These and other excellent texts offer a deep and wide understanding of the use of crystals for healing by many cultures. We highly recommend you consider these excellent books. For those new to crystal healing, this link to our guide: \" [Beginning Crystal Healing](/beginning-crystal-healing)\" will bring you to a short introduction to one popular method of crystal healing: using the power of crystals to balance the energy within your body at your key chakra nodes. Don't limit yourself to just one method. Medicine and Healers have taught us one lesson - there are many therapies, and an open mind might just be the best medicine. Click the photo below to "}
