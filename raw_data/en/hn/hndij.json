Doty Doctor of Philosophy in Information Studies University of California, Los Angeles, 2015 Professor Leah A. Lievrouw, Chair Concerns about misinformation on the Internet usua lly focus on the amount of misinformation available, the ease of retrieving it , the speed with which it spreads, or the lack of editorial oversight. Yet none of these would be cau se for concern if no one was misinformed. Indeed, what constitutes misinformation is often de termined by who believes it. Hence the most important consideration may be a focus on why peopl e believe. To explore this, this study reports results from a qualitative content analysis of online information about vaccine safety\u2014 with a particular focus on user comments\u2014supplement ed by exploratory interviews. The study examines how people on all sides of the debate use evidence to support their beliefs about vaccine safety. It also reflects upon the relation ship between the Internet and those beliefs. The most common beliefs about vaccine safety are b eliefs about toxicity, beliefs about the cumulative effects of vaccines, beliefs about t he premise of immunization, and beliefs about the compromised integrity of the medical system. C ontrary to popular conceptions, these beliefs do not divide easily into binaries of pro-vaccinati on and anti-vaccination. Rather, it is as if iii available beliefs were arrayed in a buffet from whi ch each believer chooses an individualized meal. The selection of beliefs is limited, as the same beliefs recur over and over in the data, yet each believer combines the limited selections into diverse belief profiles. People justify these beliefs using risk-benefit ca lculations based in reason and authority, both of which are heavily influenced by personal ex perience, a kind of evidence that may be more prominent on the Internet than elsewhere. The se basic tactics are employed in complex patterns that vary across beliefs, believers and si tuations. Perhaps surprisingly, while each person uses the tactics in different ways and to di fferent degrees, the same basic tactics are used on all sides of the vaccine safety debate, suggesti ng a more complicated belief landscape than the popular conception. In turn, this suggests that it is not merely that misinformation affects what we believe, but also that what we believe appears t o affect how we understand misinformation. iv The dissertation of Colin C.

But this assumption, that an increase in the number of information producers leads to an increase in mi sinformation, may misleadingly overlook the role of the information consumer, for what would be the harm of misinformation if no one believed it? To explore this, this study examines how specific users use evidence to support their beliefs. Which evidence do evaluators cite, which d o they accept, which do they reject, and what are their reasons for doing so? This study focuses on the controversy over vaccine safety, investigating people's beliefs about whether to vaccinate or not. Importantly, va ccine safety is a controversy about science, a knowledge system that relies on evidence and is exp licit about how it relies on evidence, yet its techniques and reliability have been debated. Indee d, while the scientific consensus suggests that vaccines are safe, a significant number of people n onetheless remain unconvinced by the science. Problem and General Context On the Internet, anyone, regardless of credentials, motives, or honesty, can publish information to (potentially) the entire world. Lik ewise, the Internet is increasingly replacing other media and information sources, including inte rpersonal ones (Case, 2007), especially for health information (Case; Warner & Procaccino, 2004 ). Intuitively, it seems as though this should result in more misinformation, spreading mor e quickly. Indeed, false rumors have been 2 known to spread virally through platforms such as T witter before they are ultimately corrected (Atlani-Duault, Mercier, Rousseau, Orand, Achterman & Mason, 2014). To the extent that the Internet may be unique in the production of misinformation, the popular belief se ems to be that the reason for this is that the Internet enables the \"prosumer,\" i.e., every inform ation consumer is also a potential producer. The first problem caused by the prosumer Internet i s one of information production and distribution. Since anyone can produce information quickly and easily, a great deal of information on the Internet is produced by amateurs who may lack the credentials, expertise, or even desire to properly verify the information they create (Metzger, Flanagin & Zwarun, 2003; Rieh & Hilligoss, 2008), and who operate free of ed itorial oversight or quality control 2005). This is exacerbated by the ease of sharing on the Internet. Anything consumed can rapidly be reproduced and propagated, which seems t o result in a more rapid spread of misinformation than was previously possible ( Atlani-Duault et al., Kelly, 1997; World Ec onomic Forum, 2013). The second misinformation problem is one of consump tion. On the Internet, anyone can search for information and retrieve it, regardless of their information skills (Metzger, 2007; & Danielson, 2007). There is so much information online that consumers may lack the time, skills, or desire to tell good information from bad (Case, 2007). Search engines may also \"prioritize information differently than an expert reviewer or editor might do\" ( Atlani-Duault et al., 2015, p. 54-55). Two other such explanations are, interestingly, contradictory . The more positive model proposes that the 3 ease of access to Internet information will make ve rification easier than ever before (Floridi, 1996; World Economic Forum, 2013). In this model, t he Internet would make people less misinformed than, for example, the mass media, whic h was, prior to the Internet, more difficult to verify. The opposing model is the bubble or ech o chamber model, in which consumers so narrowly tailor their information consumption throu gh filtering and personalization that they never encounter information that challenges or cont radicts what they already believe (Floridi; Pariser, 2011; Sunstein, 2007; World Economic Forum ). Hence in this model the Internet makes us more misinformed. These contradictory claims th at the Internet makes misinformation both better and worse underscore the danger of monolithi c, technologically deterministic explanations of the behavior of the Internet, as opposed to the individualized experience of any particular Internet user. Despite their opposite conclusions about Internet m isinformation, these two models share a common assumption, that misinformation can be cou ntered by opposing evidence. There is much evidence to suggest the opposite, however, inc luding findings that opposing evidence is ignored or resisted (Kuklinski, Quirk, Jerit, Schwi eder & Rich, 2000; Lewandowsky et al., 2012) and may even strengthen the original belief (Nyhan & Reifler, 2010). This exposes a further, deeper assumption that information consumers form b eliefs by rationally evaluating evidence. For certain beliefs, this may very well be true, bu t it is also rather obvious that emotional, psychological, social, political, moral and experie ntial factors complicate the criteria upon which we base our beliefs and the presumed-to-be rational process by which we form them (Metzger et el. 2010; Rieh & Hilligoss, 2008). Hence the key to understanding misinformation may n ot be a focus on its production or its dissemination, but rather on how and why it is believed. It may or may not be true that we are 4 producing more misinformation than ever. This may or may not result from the ease of its production and access, the rising number of produce rs, the lack of traditional gatekeepers, the speed of production and dissemination, or from the echo chamber of personalization filters. But if no one believes the misinformation then no one i s misinformed, and hence of what consequence is it? It is reasonable to consider t hat while the Internet may have changed how we produce information, how we search for it, and even what evidence we find, it may not have changed what we believe and why. There is also a compelling epistemological reason t o understand misinformation by focusing on belief. \"Misinformation\" is most simpl y defined as false information, and \"misinforming\" as creating false knowledge, or beli ef in something that is not true (Fallis, 2009; Fetzer, 2004; Fox, 1983). Such definitions therefor e rely upon a truth that is knowable and objective, rather than relative or socially & Luckmann, 1967; Fallis, Yet who has the auth ority to say what is misinformation and what is not? In some sense, the question \"why do people believe misinformation?\" is really \"why do people believe something other than what I believe? \" Thus, the best way to approach the study of misinformation may not be to determine what is true and what is false, but rather what is believed and what is not, and more importantly, why . As a research question and a subject of empirical study, therefore, this study does not foc us on the quality of evidence or its correspondence to reality, but rather on why people believe that something is true. Beliefs in the truth of a claim are formed, fundam entally, from the evaluation of evidence. This is often modeled as a rational, line ar process. Ford (2004), for example, describes information seeking using Popper's concept of error elimination. This model envisions an information seeker as \"constantly generating, testi ng and modifying theories\" (p. 772). The 5 seeker in a state of uncertainty forms a tentative theory, considers evidence in order to determine how well the theory addresses the uncertainty, and then revises the theory accordingly. But as Haidt (2001) argues, linear reasoning is only one k ind of cognition. While some humans may like to attribute their beliefs to rationality, Hai dt shows how intuition, in particular, heavily influences beliefs. These intuitions are rooted in emotions, biases, previous experiences and motivations in ways that are not always rational or linear (Haidt; Lewandowsky et al., 2012; Slovic, Finucane, Peters & MacGregor, 2004). Despi te this, people usually prefer to support their beliefs with some evidence, especially when d efending them against disagreement. If beliefs are based upon evidence, and evaluations of evidence are not always purely rational, then how do people evaluate the information upon which t hey base particular beliefs? What evidence do they rely upon? Which evidence do they accept a nd which do they reject? What are their reasons for accepting or rejecting any particular e vidence? To get the best understanding of this, this study f ocuses on controversial beliefs where adherents on each side of the issue can accuse each other of being misinformed. For this reason, this study seeks to understand belief on opposing s ides of a controversial issue, where evaluators may encounter evidence that is contradictory. The Case of Vaccine Safety Beliefs A fruitful place to begin to answer these question s is to investigate controversies about science, particularly where the scientific consensu s is strong and yet some hold beliefs in direct contradiction to it. As a case for studying eviden ce, science has the advantages of being a knowledge culture that explicitly relies on (empiri cal) evidence, has explicit rules for evaluating that evidence, and on the basis of these premises c ontends that its knowledge claims are uniquely 6 reliable. At the same time, the techniques and rel iability of science have been widely debated (Van House, 2004). Hence this study focuses on the controversy over v accine safety, investigating why people believe that vaccines are safe or unsafe. W hile the scientific consensus suggests that vaccines are safe (Maglione et al., 2014), a signif icant number of people nonetheless remain unconvinced, and each side of the debate accuses th e other of spreading misinformation. At the same time, vaccines have enormous public health con sequences, particularly in the face of the recent decline in vaccination rates (Baum, 2014; Li n & Poindexter, 2009; Mohajer & Kumar, 2011) and recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable d iseases (California Department of Public Health, 2015). Importantly, this is not a study of belief general ly, but of a particular kind of belief in a particular kind of environment. Vaccine safety bel iefs are different from other kinds of beliefs, such as religious beliefs, moral beliefs, or even b eliefs in other factual claims. Specifically, vaccine safety is a topic about which many are cons idered to be misinformed, and about which many disagree. At the same time, the controversy i s unevenly balanced, with one clear consensus view and a passionate minority that rejec ts that consensus. This makes it an ideal case for studying belief in misinformation. In addition, the vaccine safety controversy has pa rticular advantages as a means of studying misinformation on the Internet specificall y. Kata (2010) has found that anti-vaccination content is more common on the Internet than elsewhe re, that people doubting vaccines are more likely to use the Internet, and that the websites t hey use often misrepresent or omit medical research. Betsch (2011) has found that the Interne t can be particularly influential on beliefs about vaccination, that it exaggerates anti-vaccina tion information compared to the scientific 7 consensus, and that anti-vaccine information is ver y easy to find. Kareklas et al. (2015) similarly found that online comments about vaccine safety cou ld, under certain conditions, influence belief more than the article upon which they commented. V enkatraman, Kumar and Garg (2015) found that \"greater freedom of speech (sites like YouTube and Google) correlated with anti-vaccine views\" (p. 1424). On the other hand, McRee, Reiter and Brewer (2012) found that parents accessing information on the Internet about the HPV vaccine had higher knowledge and more vaccine positive beliefs. Hence there is reason to believe that vaccine safety beliefs may be uniquely influenced by the Internet. Similarly, misinformation itself may have enormous consequences beyond the narrow issue of vaccine safety, from misinformed health de cisions to misinformed political decisions to misinformed personal interaction. Therefore, to th e extent that insight about vaccine safety beliefs might generalize to the broader concept of misinformation, this study may enrich our understanding of misinformation, how it occurs, how serious it is, and what might be done about it. The case of vaccine safety beliefs offers insights not only into what people believe, but also how they believe it. In navigating the basic risk versus benefit calculus of vaccine safety, people attribute their beliefs to reason and rely u pon trusted authorities and their own experience. This appears to be the case regardless of their ult imate beliefs about vaccine safety, as both pro- vaccination and anti-vaccination beliefs are justif ied using similar tactics. Beliefs about vaccine safety rely upon beliefs about what is misinformati on and what is not, ultimately suggesting that misinformation influences belief and, in turn, beli ef influences the evaluation of misinformation. 8 CHAPTER TWO BACKGROUND The background for this study begins with an explor ation of the epistemology and ontology of misinformation in order to understand t he nature of the concept. Related to this inquiry is a consideration of theories of evidence from the scientific, legal, historical and archival arenas. The study also draws upon both psychologic al and sociological theories of belief in misinformation, including bias, selective exposure, social influence and social embeddedness. Lastly, the criteria by which evidence might be eva luated can be drawn from the literature of information literacy and information quality which investigate such factors as accuracy, authority, credibility, trust and authenticity. Information and Misinformation What is misinformation, as a general concept? Most scholars define it as information that is \"false, mistaken or misleading\" (Fetzer, 2004, p . 231), inaccurate (Fallis, 2009), or as otherwise fundamentally requiring falsity (Fox, 198 3). Yet such a definition immediately meets with difficulties. The first, though perhaps less important, difficult y is that this definition depends on particular conceptions of the underlying concept of information itself. To begin with, it relies upon definitions that emphasize the relationship be tween information and knowledge (Brookes, 1980; Buckland, 1991; Case, 2007) rather than those which distinguish kinds of information with no relationship to knowledge (Bates, 2005; Buckland ). More significantly, this definition of misinformation contradicts definitions which assert that information must be true in order to create knowledge (Dretske, 1981; Grice, 1989). In other words, a false belief is not knowledge and therefore that which creates true belief (infor mation) must be distinct from that which creates false belief (misinformation.) By this conception, misinformation is not information; it is the 9 opposite of information. This definition would lim it certain analyses of misinformation, however, because it implies that conclusions about information may not follow about misinformation. A better concept might be a kind o f subset model where misinformation is a portion of all information, rather than a separate entity (Case, 2007; Fox, 1983). This depends on a definition of information that does not require t hat it be true, for only if some information can be false can misinformation qualify as a subset of it. Fortunately, Fox, among other scholars (Fetzer, 2004), offers a convincing case that infor mation does not require truth. This enables a subset model that allows us to consider all models of information as potentially applicable to misinformation, regardless of whether they address misinformation explicitly. 1 A more significant complication of defining misinfo rmation as false information has to do with varying conceptions of truth. If misinfor mation is false information, then the identification of truth is essential to the identif ication of misinformation. The difficulties with identifying truth are much debated (Sherratt, 2006; Van House, 2004). Stahl (2006) points out that defining misinformation as incorrect informati on requires a correspondence theory of truth. If, however, the truth is socially constructed, as many have argued (Berger & Luckmann, 1967; Fallis, 2006; Sherratt; Van House), it follows that misinformation is socially constructed as well (Karlova & Lee, 2011). Stahl applies the ideas of F oucault and Habermas to defining misinformation, noting that since there is disagree ment as to what constitutes truth, it follows that there is disagreement as to what constitutes m isinformation. Every commitment to a particular conception of misinformation, therefore, represents a value judgment on the part of the researcher. This is even more problematic given th at most of our experience is second hand, and 1 Similar considerations surround the distinction bet ween misinformation and disinformation, as sometime s disinformation is considered to be intentional misi nformation (Fetzer, 2004; Fallis, 2009), and someti mes the two are considered synonymous or are not distinguished (Floridi, 1996). While these distinctions are impo rtant, they are properties of the production of information, and he nce are of minor relevance to the present focus on the consumption of information. 10 our determination of truth and falsity usually depe nds in part on the evaluations of others, meaning that most of us evaluate misinformation not by evaluating the information itself, but rather by evaluating those who evaluate for us and the criteria by which they evaluate it (Fallis, 2006, 2008; Van House). To decide, for example, th at scientific consensus is correct is to decide that scientists (at least, in aggregate) are trustw orthy and that their methods are reliable. It usually does not mean that we ourselves have conduc ted studies to verify the consensus. This suggests that the naming of anything as misinformation is open to debate, and does not con sist of what is empirically true or false, but rather \"what is collectively endorsed,\" (Fallis, 2006, quoting Bloor; Van House) according to dominant discourse a nd power structures (Berger & Luckmann; Sherratt; Stahl.) Who gets to say what is true or false, what is correct or incorrect, what is misinformation or not? On numerous controversial i ssues - vaccine safety among them - each side of the debate claims that the other side is sp reading misinformation. To identify any particular thing as misinformation is to privilege one set of criteria for truth evaluation over another. Hence there is an important sense in whic h misinformation is in the eye of the beholder. 2 In another sense, however, such a definition seems illogical. Not all propositions can be equally true according to who chooses to believe th em. Indeed, it is probably not very useful to treat all truth claims as equally valid, particular ly for social scientists attempting to describe lif e as it is actually lived, since human beings simply do not behave as if all truths are equally likely. We operate, for example, as if the law of gravity o n Earth is true, enough so that it would not be a good idea to leap from tall buildings. Likewise, it cannot be true both that the sun goes around the earth and the earth around the sun. It probabl y overstates the case, therefore, to conclude that 2 This is not the same as saying that misinformation is a matter of opinion, for it professes to be neit her a moral judgment nor an aesthetic one. Rather, the concept of misinformation seems to suggest an empirical ju dgment. In other words, saying that \"Hamlet\" is a bad play or that murder is good are not misinformation. 11 the social construction of knowledge means that no knowledge is better than any other (MacNeil, 2001). As Van House notes, rather than total relat ivism, it is better to recognize that any understanding of truth could have been different, w ithout asserting that scientific knowledge is \"nothing but rhetorical\" (p. 31). In some ways, constructivism and subjectivism may e ven help to explain misinformation, because over-reliance on one's subjective understan ding and one's own interpretation may be among the causes of misinformed belief. It is inte resting to note that the literature of constructivist epistemologies (Van House, 2004; She rratt, 2006; Stahl, 2006) and the literature about causes of misinformation (Kuklinski et al., 2 000; Lewandowsky et al., 2012; Nyhan & Reifler, 2010) identify many of the same factors, i ncluding bias, error, power, and discourse. Even Bruno Latour, a famous advocate of constructiv ist views of knowledge, finds himself troubled by how criticisms of the production of sci entific knowledge may have opened the door for climate change denial and 9/11 conspiracy theor ies (Latour, 2004). Where Latour once combated \"excessive confidence in ideological argum ents posturing as matters of fact,\" he finds himself concerned about excessive distrust of good matters of fact disguised as bad ideologic al biases... While we spent years trying to detect the real prej udices hidden behind the appearance of objective statements, do we now have to reveal the real objective and incontrovertible facts hidden behind the illusion of prejudices? (Latour, 2004, p. 227, emphasis in original). Indeed, it would be disconcerting to adopt an epist emological stance in which conspiracy theorists are as likely to be correct as scientific consensus. 12 It would appear, therefore, that neither a fully ob jective definition of misinformation (\"incorrect information\") nor a fully subjective on e (\"misinformation is in the eye of the beholder\") will suffice. A more appropriate, or at least useful, definition lies between these two extremes. Some thinkers, therefore, mediate the co nstructivist objections to the truth condition by distinguishing between the existence of truth an d our ability to know it with certainty (Fallis, 2006; Furner, 2004). According to this argument, w hile there is such a thing as objective reality, at least in some areas, there is no such thing as o bjective knowledge, since discourse and power interfere with our ability to know reality for cert ain. Still, some truths seem immensely more likely than others. Rather than thinking of our truth claims objectively, therefore, we might think of them as probabilities based on evidence and the consequences of treating them as if they ar e true (MacNeil, 2000, 2001). MacNeil and Mak (2007) suggest that \"[t]he truth of any proposi tion is based on reasoning from the relevant evidence and measured, not in terms of absolute cer tainty, but rather in terms of probabilities, which will always be a matter of degree\" (p. 39). W e refrain from leaping from buildings because the law of gravity seems extremely likely t o be true, partly due to its consistency in past observations, while we also understand certain circ umstances in which gravity does not apply in the same way. At the same time, the truth of natur al laws may be more empirical than the \"truth\" of human behavior, and thus our understandi ng of misinformation must be cautious from two directions: both with an awareness of the soci al context of truth evaluation and of the ambiguous reality of social behavior. Defining misinformation based merely on its truth o r falsity also fails to fully account for concerns about it. To the extent that misinformati on is considered a problem, that concern depends on its potential to misinform. By this def inition, misinformation can be considered that 13 which creates false belief (Fox, 1983). This relies on the fundamental definition of misinformation as false information, but extends it to emphasize the consequences. Consider, for example, the proposition \"the moon is made of green cheese.\" By most definitions, this qualifies as misinformation because it is not true. However, few if any people actually believe that it is true, so it does not misinform. Those who lament a n alleged increase in misinformation are presumably concerned not about misinformation per s e but about people being misinformed. Hence, defining misinformation merely as false info rmation without accounting for its potential consequences is insufficient for understanding conc erns about misinformation, including the relationship between misinformation and the Interne t. To lament misinformation as a problem is not merely to lament the existence of incorrect inf ormation, but also to lament the existence of incorrect belief. Belief In the end, misinformation probably by definition c annot exist without their being some truth for it to contradict. It is certainly diffic ult to define without some allowance for correspondence theories of truth. But we can addre ss this restriction without having to verify any truth claims ourselves by focusing on how indiv iduals make their own decisions about the truth. This study does not aim to determine which beliefs are wrong or right, to resolve controversy or to determine whether vaccines are sa fe or dangerous. Rather, the intention is to explore individual truth evaluations and their rela tionship to beliefs. This may make it unnecessary to strictly operationalize misinformati on for this study, but the focus on belief certainly favors a conception of misinformation as that which creates false belief. No matter who is wrong or right, and whether misinformation i s entirely objective or entirely constructed, we can still study belief in it. 14 But how are we to understand belief? Gilbert (1991 ) writes, \"Beliefs, in the broad and colloquial sense, involve both the mental representation and the positive assessment of meaningful information\" (p. 107, italics in origina l). As Haidt (2001) has argued, a mental representation need not imply rationality, nor even that the representation originates in the brain, but a more complex experience of impressions, intui tions, and other factors including but not limited to thinking or reasoning. Nor is the repre sentation necessarily a final decision, as even Gilbert notes, but may be subject to revision. It does seem nonsensical, however, to speak of someone believing something about which they have n o mental representation, in whatever form or to whatever degree. More importantly, to qualif y as belief by Gilbert's definition, this representation must include a positive assessment. By positive, Gilbert appears to mean that the mental representation \"is treated as if it was true \" (p. 107). Hence something one has assessed to be false, or about which one has formed no impressi on, is not something one believes. This puts the emphasis on the assessment, and in particular o n how one makes an assessment that is positive. Assessment again need not necessarily imply either a linear or a rational process, but merely something like a judgment, evaluation or imp ression. It would also seem to be more robust than a wild guess. The assessment appears t o rely, therefore, upon some criteria by which some set of things is determined to be more useful to the assessment\u2014more relevant, more important, more convincing, or whatever\u2014than some o ther set of things. The criteria for that assessment\u2014the things considered in determining whe ther the assessment is positive or negative\u2014is often called evidence. But what exactl y is evidence? In particular, how do people try to determine what constitutes \"good\" evidence? 15 Evidence Theories of evidence from the archival, legal, hist orical and scientific arenas vary (Furner, 2004; MacNeil, 2000), and although this st udy focuses on conclusions drawn from scientific evidence, it has been informed by all of those concepts of evidence to the extent that any of them may elaborate the strengths or weakness es of the others. Three kinds of evidence are relevant to this study : that which scientists consult, that which the subjects of the study consult, and that w hich we as researchers consult. The first kind, the scientific evidence itself, consists of what th e scientists study in order to draw conclusions about vaccine safety, including experimental data i n laboratories, epidemiological data, and the like. The evidence that subjects of the study cons ult - found on the Internet and elsewhere - consists of evidence about the science and evidence of personal experiences w ith vaccine safety. Evidence about the science is notably not the scien tific evidence itself, but rather descriptions of it at one level of remove. Evidence of personal ex periences consists either of firsthand experience with one's own child, or of anecdotal ex perience about another person's child. The third kind of evidence, the kind collected for this study, is evidence about people's beliefs and evaluations. While the study does not focus on how this third kind of evidence is evaluated, it is worth noting that it is nonetheless evidence being evaluated, and hence the epistemological concerns we may have about evidence evaluation appl y not only to the evidence that is the subject of the study, but also to the study itself. It is also worth noting that the Internet is constructed by humans and thus the evidence there i s constructed. The Internet itself contains little if any primary, direct evidence of vaccine s afety. However, it does contain direct and indirect evidence of belief and evaluation, and it is the latter that is the subject of this study. 16 Much like definitions of misinformation, definitio ns of evidence begin with positivist conceptions. Duranti (1998), writing specifically about documentary evidence, defines evidence as the \"source of proof of facts that needed to be demonstrated\" (p. 5), and as \"a relationship between a fact to be proven and the fact that prove s it\" (p. 6). MacNeil (2000) describes the concept of \"evidence as inference\" in which evidenc e is a sign or trace of an external reality. Furner (2004) softens the concept to allow more sub jectivity by defining evidence as \"that which we consider or interpret in order to draw or infer a conclusion\" (p. 247). Evidence is therefore a kind of justification of belief, which classical ep istemology considers an essential component of knowledge (Fallis, 2006; Furner, 2010). All of these definitions suggest some sort of caus e and effect relationship between the evidence and that proposition that the evidence pur ports to \"prove.\" In other words, if proposition p would result in evidence e, then our observation of evidence e suggests the truth of proposition p, and the lack of evidence e suggests (to whatever degree), the falsity of propo sition p. The exact relationship between the evidence and the proposition it proves depends on the kind of proposition at issue. Legal, historical an d archival evidence, for example, all seek to prove historical events using as evidence the resul ts of those events (Furner, 2004; MacNeil, 2000). For example, a document may be evidence to a jury, historian or archivist that a certain transaction has taken place (see also Duranti, 1998 ). Scientific evidence, however, often has different aims. While it may seek to prove histori cal events, such as biological evolution, science also uses evidence predictively, to assess, for example, whether it will rain tomorrow, or how a vaccine may affect a child. Science is there fore unique in using evidence to assess cause and effect relationships, such as the relationship between clouds and rain, or between vaccines 17 and autism. This is a more complex standard of e vidence, since probably even a strict positivist would not argue that the future can be known with c ertainty. Importantly, not even the fields specializing in h istorical evidence (lawyers, historians and archivists) assert that evidence is conclusive proof of an external reality. Rather, evidence is conceived in terms of probabilities, such that our inference about a particular proposition comes from our assessing the likelihood of one fact in li ght of another fact, i.e. our assessing the likelihood of a proposition in light of evidence (F urner, 2004; MacNeil, 2000, 2001; MacNeil & Mak, 2007). As describes this use of eviden ce by scientists, \"we calculate the effect of observed evidence on our degree of belief in a hypo thesis\" and conclude that the evidence confirms the hypothesis to the extent that it incre ases belief (p.238). Notably, this description characterizes evidence in terms of belief rather th an truth. It is possible, of course, that evidence could increase someone's belief in a proposition wi thout increasing the likelihood that it is objectively true. Furthermore, beliefs can obvious ly be incorrect, while empirical truth by definition cannot be. Indeed, Furner himself chara cterizes beliefs in terms of \"personal evaluations\" and \"preferential attitudes\" rather th an as objective certainties (p. 253). Hence, evidence is not seen as reflecting reality, but rat her as influencing our own evaluation of reality, consistence with constructivist assertions that onl y belief, and not objective knowledge, is possible. In light of this, Furner (2004) proposes a less positivist definition of evidence as that which serves as (or that which provides) groun ds for a person's belief in the truth of a target proposition or conclusion. We mi ght wish to say, for instance, that a proposition p is evidence for q if it is grounds (i.e., reason, cause, warrant) for believing q (p. 255). 18 This is of paramount relevance to this study, becau se we are not aiming to evaluate the evidence or its correspondence to reality, but rather to des cribe how that evidence is evaluated to support beliefs. Importantly, this characterizes evidence not in th e binary terms of proof or disproof, but rather as a matter of degree (Furner, 2004; MacNeil & Mak, 2007). In other words, the degree of belief is a measure of how strong the evidence is, or how much it is determined to support the proposition. As Fallis (2004) puts it, if the evid ence of accuracy is better than the evidence of inaccuracy, the claim is likely to be accurate. Th e level of confidence in this assessment would be determined by how much more evidence is found fo r accuracy than for inaccuracy. It is in this context that we are said to consider the stren gth or \"weight\" of evidence. The criteria by which the weight of evidence is measured include it s degree of remove from the proposition, its directness or indirectness, its degree of consensus or contradiction, and its logical consistency. The strongest evidence for any proposition is firs thand evidence, such as actually observing the event or proposition itself. 3 Direct observation is often impossible, however, for any number of reasons. We rarely if ever see facts ; we usually only see evidence (MacNeil, 2000). This is particularly true in the case of pr edictive evidence and evidence of causality. A person forming a belief about vaccine safety, for e xample, cannot observe the effect of vaccination or non-vaccination in the future, nor c an he or she observe a vaccination initiating some process in the body that results in autism. H e or she can only directly observe the vaccination and the symptoms. Most evidence, there fore, exists at some level of remove from the event or proposition that it purports to prove. This is similar to the distinction in the law between direct evidence and circumstantial evidence , where direct evidence of an event is provided through the testimony of a firsthand witne ss, whereas circumstantial evidence requires 3 Although, of course, as any magician knows, even d irect observation is imperfect. 19 an inference based on other evidence (Furner, 2004) . This suggests two categories of secondhand or indirect evidence, that based on reas on (Furner; MacNeil, 2001) and that based on testimony (Fallis, 2006, 2008). Indeed, most of the evidence that anyone evaluates about anything is actually secondhand evidence received through the testimony of others ( Fallis, 2006, 2008) including through reading, anecdotes, or the media. This necessitate s a second layer of evidence evaluation, for now to form a belief one must evaluate both the pro position itself and the source of information about it (Fallis, 2006, 2008; Van House, 2004). As we shall discuss later, there are numerous criteria by which people evaluate sources. The one most relevant to considerations of the weig ht of evidence is the idea of consensus. While we may have reason to doubt the r eliability of any particular source, the accumulation of numerous sources that are in agreem ent tends to improve the probability that we believe a proposition. Indeed, accumulation and fr equency of evidence affect the weight of direct evidence as well, for the more evidence we o bserve for a particular proposition, the more inclined we are to believe it. This depends on the premise that factors which might compromise the credibility of any particular piece of evidence , such as bias or error, become less and less likely with each additional piece of supporting evi dence. While this is a helpful technique, it is imperfect, since it is nonetheless possible for con sensus to be incorrect due to embeddedness within institutions and social circles that support particular points of view (Zucker, 1977; Granovetter, 1985). For example, one cannot judge the evidence for climate change or the theory of evolution based upon the number of people who reject them. Indeed, from a positivist/objectivist perspective, the number of p eople who believe in a proposition is not necessarily a measure of any objective reality. 20 A better measure, according to some paradigms, is t he second category of indirect evidence, that based on reason. Our inferences ab out the relationship between two facts, such as that one fact is evidence for the other, are based on logical principles that we believe connect the two facts (MacNeil, 2000). These can include gener alizations, hypotheses, induction and deduction (Furner, 2004). In essence, A is only g ood evidence of B if the relationship between A and B is logical. An example of this is the corre lation-causation fallacy, where the observation of two sequential events may appear to be evidence that one event caused the other. This is a commonly cited reason for doubts about vaccine safe ty, where parents observe the appearance of symptoms shortly after their child received a vacci nation and thus conclude the vaccination caused the symptoms. From a rationalist perspectiv e, even these direct observations by parents are poor evidence of causation, because the conclus ion does not necessarily follow from the premises. Indeed, according to the principle of ev idence by induction, if the connection between the evidence and the proposition is logically falla cious, then the evidence is weak (Furner). Thus the very strongest evidence is evidence that contra dicts the proposition, for while no number of swans can definitively prove the proposition that a ll swans are white, a single black swan can refute the proposition (Popper, 1959.) Rationalist s contend that logically sound conclusions are objective evidence, because they follow from natura l laws of the world that do not arise from interpretation. However, as we shall discuss later , rational processes are complicated by emotion and bias (Haidt, 2001; Kuklinski et al., 2000; Slov ic et al., 2004) and may seem more objective than they really are (Mooney, 2011). In summary, we can define evidence as that which is assessed in forming a belief. By Gilbert's (1991) definition of belief, this would m ean that which is assessed in forming a positive mental representation of information. In the class ic epistemological definition of knowledge, 21 \"justified true belief\" (Fallis, 2006; Furner, 2010 ), evidence would be that which is used to justify a belief as true. Supporting evidence stre ngthens belief that the proposition is true, and contradictory evidence weakens that belief. The st rongest evidence comes from one's own firsthand observations, but most evidence comes fro m secondary sources either through the testimony of others or through logical inference. When speaking of the kinds of things that evidence is evidence of , we are usually referring either to historical evi dence that suggests events have taken place in the past, or predictive evidenc e that suggests the likelihood of events occurring in the future based on the historical obs ervation of causal relationships. Evidence Evaluation With this epistemological and ontological backgrou nd, we can begin to explore theories of how misinformation is believed. As previously n oted, the assessment that underlies belief has elements of rational analysis and elements of intui tion, some conscious and some subconscious, some psychological, some social and some cultural. The circumstances of evaluation and the experiences of the evaluator both influence what ev idence is considered and how it is assessed. Case's (2007) broad survey of information seeking r esearch suggests several aspects of information seeking behavior that may lead to misin formation. The first relates to Zipf's law of least effort, which describes a seeker's \"tendency to rely on easily available sources\" and \"the first satisfactory solution to a problem\" (Case, p. 8). This suggests that misinformation may result from less than thorough investigation of an issue. In this regard, Case outlines how different motivations and pressures can result in d iffering degrees of thoroughness. One common tactic is the idea of satisficing where, in the face of information overload, a seek er tailors and filters information as a strategy for t ime management and volume control (see also Bawden & Robinson, 2009). A frequent means of doi ng so is through selective exposure 22 whereby searchers tend to seek information that is \"congruent with their prior knowledge, beliefs and attitudes\" (Case, p. 336). Because of the pres ent study's interest in belief, it is interesting t o consider that this, as Case describes, is a means b y which belief can constrain information seeking behavior, including the motivation to seek at all. If a seeker will cease seeking once he or she feels that an information need is met, it ma y be that he or she is more likely to direct the search toward simple, comfortable information rathe r than complex, challenging information that might prolong the search, as indeed other research suggests (Hart et al., 2009; Lewandowsky et al., 2012; Metzger et al., 2010; Nyhan, 2010). The result of these strategies, however, can be a failure to be as complete and accurate as possible. The preference for familiar information apparently extends to information sources as well, as Case's (2007) survey suggests that people tend to favor their own experiences or their personal contacts over other sources, including doc tors. Importantly, in several of the studies that Case cites, the Internet seems to rival interp ersonal relationships as the most important information sources. Indeed, the Internet itself i s also seen as \"a source of interpersonal communication and emotional support\" (Case, p. 298) . This is notable in light of arguments that the Internet exacerbates misinformation. White (20 14) found that pre-existing beliefs influence search behavior and that search engine ranking can influence beliefs. Other researchers have found similar results with regard to searches about vaccine safety in particular (Betsch, 2011; Downs, de Bruin & Fischhoff, 2008; Ruiz & Bell, 201 4). Several studies have also found that vaccine criticism is more prevalent and prominent o n the Internet than in the medical consensus 2002; Kata, 2012). 23 The concept of satisficing in the face of the Inter net's enormous quantity of information is at the center of many theories of Internet misin formation. Metzger et al. (2010), for example, compare mass media and new media environments in te rms of abundance and scarcity. They see mass media, with fewer information producers, as an environment of information scarcity that provides more content gatekeeping and requires (and enables) less verification on the part of the consumer. The Internet, by contrast, is an environ ment of information abundance where verification is both easier and more necessary. Th e strategies for evaluating such enormous quantities of information, however, may have seriou s consequences for information quality. Swinnen et al.'s (2005) examination of media orga nizations predicts a \"rationally ignorant consumer,\" meaning that constraints of bud get and time make it \"rational for consumers to be imperfectly informed\" (p. 178). They identif y three reasons for this. First, if the cost of new information is higher than its benefit, then \"c onsumers will prefer to inform themselves only up to a point where further acquisition of informat ion will be too costly\" (p. 178-179). Second, if \"opportunity costs\" are too high, a consumer wil l prefer to be imperfectly informed. For example, most consumers simply do not have the time , skills or resources to verify every bit of information they encounter. Third, if information diverges from a consumer's ideology, the benefit of consuming it must be greater than the th reat of the divergence, a concept that recurs throughout similar literature, as we shall see. Ov erall, in economic terms, if information is not to a consumer's taste, he or she will not bother with it unless he or she anticipates some benefit from it. Metzger et al. (2010) found that Internet users ad opted certain cognitive shortcuts in their evaluation of credibility. In particular, th e researchers distinguished five different heuristi cs that subjects employed in order to make their credi bility judgments when lacking the time or 24 motivation for deeper analysis. The first, the reputation heuristic , was employed because evaluators preferred well-known sources and informa tion to lesser known ones. The similar endorsement heuristic found evaluators trusting information because othe rs trusted it. This idea of consensus was also key in the consistency heuristic by which evaluators in the study attributed credibility when they perceived agreement among sev eral sources. The subjects of the study also used heuristics to identify sources that were not credible, such as the persuasive intent heuristic by which evaluators doubted the credibility of a w ebsite if they perceived that it was trying to market to them or otherwise persuade them of something. A fifth heuristic, the expectancy violation heuristic , found evaluators distrusting sources that did not meet their expectations. This heuristic was invoked in many d ifferent ways, including when the website sought more information than the user deemed necess ary, or when the site redirected to another site. In line with the recurring findings of other studies, one violation of expectation that the subjects perceived was a violation of their existin g personal beliefs. In other words, if the site did not agree with what they already believed, user s tended to doubt its credibility. Some even stopped searching after finding confirmation, and a ctively avoided contrary information. Metzger et al. are quick to point out that such sho rtcuts may or may not have a negative impact on the quality of information evaluation, since on the one hand the use of heuristics may be biased or cause mistakes, while on the other hand i t makes the processing more efficient and is often equally effective. The ease with which the Internet enables such behav ior is a chief reason why the consumer is so important to considerations of misin formation on the Internet. As Floridi (1996) predicted, the Internet allows a consumer to person alize information quite easily to his or her own tastes, and thus to his or her own biases. A consumer, under the impression that the 25 Internet makes him or her better informed, is incre asingly likely to be subject to his or her own idiosyncrasies. This information tailoring, as Floridi calls it, could result in self-disinformation , a process by which information consumers misinform themselves. The means by which this might occur, as Hitlin (200 3) and Sunstein (2007) worry, is that once there are too many Internet users, they fragme nt into interest groups that limit their information consumption and revert to the influence of what amounts to small information monopolies. As one strategy for managing informat ion overload, information consumers utilize filtering and personalization tools to favor one ki nd of information over another. This often means excluding information they have not sought ou t, including information that might expand or challenge their beliefs. Indeed, Metzger et al . (2010) observed exactly this behavior among the subjects of their study, who explicitly favored websites with views similar to their own (see also Hart et al., 2009). In this personalized Inte rnet environment, Sunstein (2007) argues, the loss of the \"general-interest intermediaries\" like mass media and newspapers means the loss of unexpected encounters with new and diverse ideas an d shared experiences. For Sunstein the \"fragmentation and extremism\" that could result mig ht have enormous consequences for democracy because of its potential to isolate peopl e from each other ideologically (p. 5-6). At the same time, attempts to empirically measure such effects have found the concerns to be exaggerated (Garrett, 2009; Jang 2014). Eli Pariser (2011) worries that the exclusions of f iltering and personalization are not only created by the user, but are also increasingly auto mated in the algorithms of sites like Facebook and Google. Because each of these sites monitors a nd analyzes user behavior, they automatically provide the information consumer with information t ailored to his or her previous behavior. Hence, for example, Google might record a person's preference for sites of a particular political 26 point-of-view, then favor results from those sites in subsequent search results. Likewise, as Pariser observed in his own experience, Facebook mi ght exclude new, diverse or challenging ideas because its automatic system favors content p osted by friends with whom the user interacts most. Of particular importance to Pariser is the f act that such filtering strategies are invisible to the user of the sites. Hence, an information consu mer may be burrowed into an ideological echo chamber unknowingly or even unwillingly. Interestingly, however, other researchers have sugg ested that Pariser may be exaggerating the problem, as they have had difficulty reproducin g Pariser's results (Weisberg, 2011). Likewise, Weinberger (2011) notes that filters do n ot actually remove any information; they merely increase the effort needed to locate it. Ev en Sunstein (2007) acknowledges that the Internet also provides immense opportunity to find new things that were once much more difficult to find, as Floridi (1996) had previously predicted. The difficulty, however, is that this potential of the Internet requires that users actua lly seek out a diversity of information which, as we shall see, they may not do. Indeed, even consumers that are exposed to diverse information may be inclined to reject it. Attempts to correct misinformation often fail to change beliefs (Lewandowsky et al., 2012) as Nyhan et al. (2014) found was specifically the case with attempts to correct attitudes toward vaccination. This is because people\u2014all people, no t necessarily misinformed ones\u2014tend to get entrenched and protect their existing beliefs. Hart et al. (2009) conducted a meta-analysis of studies regarding bias toward congenial or uncongen ial information and confirmed that people often have a preference for information that confir ms their pre-existing beliefs. Information evaluation is guided either by the defense motivation to defend existing beliefs or the accuracy motivation to make accurate evaluations. One may prefer cong enial information when faced 27 with threat or discomfort, including \"from a self-t hreat, such as the perception that one is poorly informed\" (p. 557). In addition, an expectation of high quality information may enhance the defense motivation bias toward confirmatory informa tion, as may a high level of commitment to one's opinions. Much psychology research attributes these cognitiv e biases to the integral relationship between reason and emotion. Slovic et al. (2004) emphasize the influence upon reason of affect, the fast, automatic intuition that something is eit her good or bad. \"People,\" Slovic et al. write, \"base their judgments of an activity or a technolog y not only on what they think about it but also on how they feel about it\" (p. 315, emphasis in original). Haidt (2001) describes how, contrary to glorification of humans as reasoning through clu es toward a correct conclusion, we most often make quick, intuitive judgments that we retrospecti vely justify through reason. \"The emerging view in social cognition,\" Haidt writes, \"is that m ost of our behaviors and judgments are in fact made automatically\" (p. 819) rather than through re asoned steps of deliberation. Gilbert (1991) finds that disbelief is more cognitively difficult than belief, because the brain must accept a proposition before it can doubt it. Belief, in oth er words, is automatic, but disbelief requires \"deliberate revision\" (Gilbert, p. 108). This caus es us to bias our information searches towards supportive information, and apply more scrutiny to opposing evidence (Haidt). As Mooney (2011) notes, this is particularly easy to do with scientific evidence, which is complex and prone to misunderstanding (see also Munro, 2010). In add ition, as Carl Sagan (1996) noted, certain kinds of unsubstantiated beliefs provide a sense of order or control, and therefore have strong emotional motivations. Knowingly or unknowingly, m any consumers would rather be comfortable than fully informed. 28 One famous theory that may be applicable is Sherif 's social judgment theory (Sherif & Hovland, 1961) which models human judgment as based upon an \"anchor\" of previous experience. Each person judges how far a new idea deviates from that anchor. The degree of that deviation either falls within the latitude of acceptance, which means an evaluator will agree with the idea, the latitude of rejection, which mea ns an evaluator will not agree, or the latitude of noncommitment. This judgment is influenced by the involvement of the ego, such that great ego involvement means a larger latitude of rejection, a smaller degree of noncommitment, and a lower expected change in belief. Kahneman (2011) has famously divided cognitive proc essing into two systems. \"System 1\" is the more automatic system, and \"system 2\" the more deliberative and effortful. These two systems are not independent, but influence each oth er in ways that affect how we evaluate information: System 2 is more of an apologist for the emotions o f System 1 than a critic of those emotions\u2014 an endorser rather than an enforcer. Its search for information and arguments is mostly constrained to information that is consis tent with existing beliefs, not with an intention to examine them.\" (pp. 103-104). One of the consequences of this interplay of cognit ive systems is a bias in our perception of risk. As Kahneman puts it, \"Our expectations about the fr equency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed\" (p. 138). Kahneman's two systems are similar to the elaborati on likelihood model of Petty and Cacioppo (1986) which distinguishes between central and peripheral processing. Central processing involves much more critical thinking tha n peripheral processing, including a greater diversity of sources. Which of the two processing strategies a particular believer adopts depends 29 upon motivation and ability. The more relevant a t opic is, the more likely the evaluator is to think critically about it, and the less relevant, t he more likely the evaluator is to accept the new idea based upon other criteria, such as the credibi lity of a source. In a complementary model, DiMaggio (1997) distingui shes deliberative cognition , the kind of critical thinking that would tend to discou rage misinformation, from automatic cognition, the uncritical acceptance of ideas. DiMaggio, a so ciologist, notes that automatic cognition derives from social structures that \"provide defaul t assumptions\" about ideas (p. 269). In other words, information consumers derive many of their o wn beliefs from the existing belief structures in their society. DiMaggio further note s that this is consistent with Merton's theory of pluralistic ignorance in which \"people act with ref erence to shared representations of collective opinion that are empirically inaccurate\" (p. 272). This idea of \"cultural cognition,\" as Kahan (2010) puts it, \"causes people to interpret new evi dence in a biased way that reinforces their predispositions. As a result, groups with opposing values often become more polarized, not less, when exposed to scientifically sound info rmation\" (p. 296). This influence of social factors on psychological states is at least partially explained by Granovetter's (1985) idea that most behavior cannot be separated from the interpersonal relationships in which it is embedded, while at the same time actors behave neither outside society nor entirely at the mercy of it. One effec t of this embeddedness is to emphasize commitment and thereby discourage change by keeping behavior obedient to existing norms and values. Staw (1981) identifies four social reasons why we tend to commit more strongly to beliefs when they are challenged: the need to just ify previous actions, the influence of norms for consistency, and a consideration of both the probab ility and value of future results. All of these 30 factors are motivated both by an internal need to f eel competent and an external need to demonstrate competence to others. A related insight from the Rogers model of diffusio n (Hall, 2004; Rogers, 2002) is the influence of charismatic opinion leaders or change agents who, predictably, make adoption more likely. This would seem to be consistent with the findings of Vornik, Sharman and Garry (2003) that power and social attractiveness were particula rly persuasive with misinformation. Importantly, however, this is not the same as sayin g that celebrities influence our beliefs, as many people are inclined to believe, since Rogers a lso notes that while mass media sources are effective at creating knowledge about a new innovat ion, they do not encourage adoption of that innovation as effectively as interpersonal channels of communication do. This applies not only to celebrities, but to mass media dissemination of science, for \"most individuals evaluate an innovation, not on the basis of scientific research by experts, but through the subjective evaluations of near-peers who have already adopted the innovation\" (Rogers, p. 990). Granovetter (1973) similarly suggests that weak soc ial ties are effective at spreading information, but may be less effective than strong social ties at reinforcing belief. On one hand, this means that the information that is most access ible through weak ties is the information that might challenge the insular values that strong ties reinforce. This comports with Floridi's (1996) and Fallis's (2008) assertion that access to a dive rsity of information might be the best counter to misinformation. However, access to information doe s not always amount to belief in it, and given Rogers's and Granovetter's emphasis on the in fluence of strong interpersonal relationships, strong ties may be better than weak ties at converting misinformation into belief. Strong, misinformed belief is often studied in the context of conspiracy theories. Skepticism about vaccine safety has some similariti es to conspiracy theories, in particular the 31 assertion that pharmaceutical companies are conspir ing to hide evidence that vaccines are dangerous (Kennedy, 2005). Several studies have f ound that conspiratorial thinkers are commonly alienated by a lack of education, lower so cioeconomic status, and a lack of political power (Goertzel, 1994; Stempel, Hargrove & Stempel, 2007). Such findings may not apply to controversies about vaccine safety, however, since anti-vaccination beliefs are more prominent among the affluent and well-educated. At the same time, conspiratorial thinking is also most common among members of marginalized groups with \"u s versus them\" worldviews, and as a \"populist protest against powerful elites\" (Stempel et al., p. 356). Notably, anti-vaccination beliefs are sometimes rooted in anti-corporate sent iments, anti-government sentiments, and feelings that personal liberty is infringed by vacc ination schedules. This is further elaborated by Swami, Chamorro-Premuzic and Furnham (2010) who hav e found that rejections of mainstream views are often motivated by a distrust of the inst itutions from which those views originate. Such skepticism is at the heart of the frequently a rticulated motivation for doubts about vaccine safety that pharmaceutical companies spend money to influence both research findings and the recommendations of medical organizations. Kuklinski et al. (2000) articulate an additional a spect of political belief that may be applicable to vaccine safety beliefs, which is the distinction between being uninformed and being misinformed. Many people are not uninformed, but r ather believe incorrect information which they then use to form preferences. With many consp iracy theories, believers have meticulously researched the smallest details of the issue, and h ence certainly do not believe out of ignorance. Yet Kuklinski et al. also found that it is those wh o are misinformed, rather than those who are uniformed, that are most likely to resist facts tha t contradict their beliefs. Lewandowsky et al., (2012) agree: 32 Ignorance rarely leads to strong support for a caus e, in contrast to false beliefs based on misinformation, which are often held strongly and w ith (perhaps infectious) conviction. For example, those who most vigorously reject the s cientific evidence for climate change are also those who believe they are best informed a bout the subject (p. 10). One possible explanation for conspiracy theories, t herefore, may be that believers are thoroughly informed, but by biased, unreliable, or otherwise i nsufficient sources. Stempel et al. (2007) found a strong suggestion that \"less legitimate an d less regulated media sources, such as tabloids, Internet blogs, and radio talk shows, pla y a prominent role in creating conspiracy beliefs\" (p. 355). They also found \"robust positiv e associations between belief in conspiracy theories and higher consumption of non-mainstream m edia (blogs and tabloids)\" (p. 366). Jenkins and Thorburn (2003) similarly suggest that many alienated (political) groups use alternative media because the mainstream media will not take them seriously. A final useful framework for understanding vaccine safety beliefs comes from Rogers (2002), who has applied his famous theory of the di ffusion of innovation to identify five factors influencing the adoption of preventive innovations in particular. The first of Rogers's categories is the relative advantage of the innovation, or how much better the innovati on seems than the prior technology. Obviously, people will adopt vac cines if they perceive them to be advantageous. Rogers's second category, compatibility , refers to how consistent the innovation is with existing values, needs, and past experience s. This is consistent with the psychological research we have already discussed. The third fact or affecting diffusion is complexity , or how difficult the innovation is to use. With regard to vaccines, it certainly seems plausible that the complexity of the technology, the human immune syst em, and disease contagion may make vaccine safety more difficult to believe. Rogers' s last two categories, trialability (ease of 33 testing) and observability (visibility to others) are probably crucial to vac cine adoption, since the average consumer can neither test vaccine safety th emselves nor directly observe conferred immunity, both of which would provide obstacles to vaccine adoption. In summary, there are several qualities of human b ehavior, sociality and cognition that may encourage misinformation, particularly in the f ace of the immense size of the Internet. Strategies for managing information overload, such as heuristics, filtering and personalization, may exclude contradictory information that could di lute misinformation. At the same time, the avoidance or discounting of contradiction is a basi c human instinct, given our unconscious biases and the influence of emotion on cognition. In addi tion, we are more likely to embrace the values of those cultures in which we are embedded and more likely to reject the values of the cultures from which we feel alienated. Particularly notable across the breadth of scholarship are the recurring references to the influence of personal e xperience and the assessment of the experiences of others. Evidence evaluation does no t take place in a vacuum of pure reason. All of these factors\u2014internal and external, past and pr esent\u2014may have an influence not only on how we evaluate evidence, but even what evidence we choose. Criteria for Evaluation A large body of scholarship has attempted to ident ify the specific criteria that people employ when evaluating information. Though some of this work is specific to the Internet, it is rooted in basic considerations of information liter acy and the concerns of information professionals with providing quality materials and thorough education in the use of them. Importantly, many studies of users as they evaluate information indicate that they apply different criteria in different situations (Metzger, 2007; Me tzger et al., 2003; Rieh & Belkin, 1998) depending on the importance of the information (Rie h & Danielson, 2007), the context (Metzger; 34 Rieh & Hilligloss, 2008) and the level of skill (Ah mad, Komlodi, Wang & Hercegfi, 2010). Hence the evaluation of evidence is both subjective and contextual. Much of the literature about evaluating informatio n refers to the broader concept of information quality. Many of the criteria for inf ormation quality are applicable to evaluating misinformation, and many are not. For example, cri teria for quality that are common across multiple sources (Ambre, Guard, Perveiler, Renner Rieh & Danielson, 2007) include accuracy, comprehensiveness, currency, reliability and validi ty, while less common criteria include authority, credibility, verifiability, bias, and th e hierarchy of evidence. All of these criteria may help in identifying misinformation. On the other hand, other common measures of information quality, such as relevance, usability, design, popu larity, grammar, spelling and composition, seem unlikely to correlate with misinformation. Am ong the terms applicable to misinformation, accuracy seems the most relevant, since the common, positivist definition of misinformation is essentially information that is not accurate. Accu racy is usually defined as being free from error (Fallis, 2004, 2006, 2008; Kelton, Fleischmann & Wa llace, 2008; Metzger et al., 2003). The question then becomes how information consumers mig ht evaluate accuracy. Accuracy. As previously discussed, there are two ways to eva luate and verify a proposition: either through direct experience or through the testimony of others (Fallis, 2004; see also Rieh, 2002). While direct observation may seem the most likely t o be accurate, since it would seem to be unfiltered, as we have seen it is in fact filtered through the perceiver's own biases, particularly toward preexisting beliefs. Furthermore, we acquir e most of our knowledge from secondary sources (Fallis, 2006, 2008). Each of these sourc es may have biases of its own, and it is very 35 difficult to detect those biases when evaluating th e source. On the Internet, however, everything is essentially a secondary source. Verification of accuracy on the Internet, therefore, is essentially the verification of (recorded) testimon y - of determining upon which testimony it is best to rely. Taraborelli (2008) notes that we adopt \"epistemic d eference\" toward external sources of information in order to extend our beliefs beyond t he limits of our own ability to evaluate. In other words, we defer evaluations to others when it is too difficult to do the evaluation ourselves, because we lack the time, skills, or access to the evidence. This means we must defer evaluative judgments or \"extensive inspection of the content and creden tials\" in favor of predictive judgments which determine the \"expected reliability of a sou rce prior to its actual inspection\" (Taraborelli, p. 196; see also Rieh, 2002). In ess ence, predictive judgments are educated guesses about how richer evaluative judgments might go. Wi th regard to the accuracy of information, this might equate to using predictive judgments to evaluate information based on its source when it is too difficult to perform evaluative judgments based on its content. Thus, an information consumer might evaluate accura cy by seeking independent corroboration of a proposition (an aspect of many o f the heuristics discussed in Metzger et al., 2010). As Fallis (2004) notes, the number of beli evers of any factual claim is likely to be lower for misinformation than for accurate information. This is not always the case, however, as consensus can build around incorrect information (d el Giudice, 2010). For example, it is quite easy\u2014particularly on the Internet\u2014to find numerous sources supporting a conspiracy theory, questioning climate change, or challenging the theo ry of evolution. The number of believers alone, therefore, is likely a better measure of the prevalence of an idea than of its validity. In addition, \"Repetition effects may create a perceive d social consensus even when no consensus 36 exists\" (Lewandowsky et al., 2012, p. 113). In thi s regard, Fallis emphasizes that \"agreement between sources should not increase our degree of c onfidence in the accuracy of a piece of information unless those sources are independent\" ( p. 471). Without this limitation, an evaluator could be fooled by false consensus. In t he end, the reliability of an evaluation based on consensus would depend on whose consensus was noted . Information supported by the best sources would be considered the most likely to be a ccurate. The process of determining which are the best sources, of course, is an equally comp licated task. Verification through corroboration is also complica ted by the black swan problem, which suggests that corroboration can never prove an asse rtion correct, but falsification can prove it incorrect (Popper, 1959). For example, Price and H ersh (1999) found it much easier to identify indicators of a lack of quality than of high qualit y, suggesting that the best criteria for identifyin g misinformation might be those that correlate with i naccuracy rather than accuracy. This may amount to seeking contradiction rather than corrobo ration. At the same time, this approach has limitations, since determining that two sources dis agree does not by itself help to determine which source is more likely to be correct. Therefo re, a robust falsification approach might also incorporate both the size of the disagreement and t he identification of certain warning signs. Scholars have identified many such warning signs, s uch as requests for money, irrelevant credentials, appeals to emotion, unsubstantiated cl aims, and opinion markers (Fitzgerald, 1997), testimonials, guarantees and claims of persecution (Morahan-Martin & Anderson, 2000), or claims of oughs,' or the 'secret cure' (Ambre al., 1997). Sites that are widely contradicted by credi ble sources, and that display these or other warning signs, may have a higher probability of mis information. 37 As many scholars note, the most important measure o f an indicator of accuracy is that it actually correlates with accuracy (Fallis, 2004; Ta raborelli, 2008). Many of the studies on the subject are about what individual people use as ind icators. That is not necessarily the same thing as what they should use, because what users expect to correlate with a ccuracy may or may not actually correlate (Fallis, 2004). In several studies, Fallis and Fricke have attempte d to empirically evaluate the correspondence between accuracy and any particular indicators of it. In one study, they took several indicators from published guidelines and co mpared them to various websites about treating fever in children (Fallis & Fricke, 2002). They found three indicators correlated with accuracy: a HONCode logo (the seal of the Health o n the Net Foundation indicating that certain standards have been met), a dot-org domain name, an d the display of copyright information. Some expected indicators did not correlate well wit h accuracy, including the identification of an author or the author's having medical credentials, and some did not correlate with inaccuracy, such as a lack of currency or the presence of adver tising. In a subsequent study involving websites about Ewing's Sarcoma (Fricke & Fallis, 20 02) they found only one indicator\u2014a dot- com domain\u2014correlated with accuracy. Likewise, the y found a lack of correlation with expected measures, including the medical credential s of the author. A few years later, Fricke and Fallis (2004) applied similar methodology to ready reference websites, testing similar but slightly di fferent criteria for correlation with accuracy or inaccuracy. Again they found that the presence of advertising did not correlate with inaccuracy. They also found that currency and the presence of c opyright information did correlate with accuracy, as did three link analysis metrics: plac ement in search results, Google toolbar score, and the number of in-links. In a study the followi ng year (Fricke, Fallis, Jones & Luszko, 2005) 38 about carpal tunnel syndrome, they again found that the link analysis metrics correlated well with accuracy, and medical credentials did not corr elate. In this study, they explicitly tested for biased content and found that unbiased discussion c orrelated with accuracy and biased discussion with inaccuracy. Of course, the inconsistency of the results of the se studies is problematic. For example, one study finds that accuracy correlates with a dot -com address and another with a dot-org address. Similarly, certain correlations, such as that between accuracy and the display of copyright information, seem coincidental and, once identified, would be quite easy to fake. Likewise, correlations found in one study, such as a HONCode logo, are not replicated in other studies. Even Fallis's most consistent result, a c orrelation between accuracy and a high number of in-links from other websites, is a correlation t hat is likely to represent popularity and notability rather than accuracy. Overall then, while many existing techniques can be gin to address the problem, the evaluation of accuracy is a difficult and imperfect task. In principle, accuracy is an objective characteristic of information. As we have seen, ho wever, that formulation is complicated by the knowability of truth and the reliance on secondary sources. One must always decide whose representations to privilege. This is a noteworthy conundrum that amounts, in some sense, to not evaluating accuracy at all, but rather some subject ive proxy for accuracy. Existing scholarship has grouped around four possible such proxies: aut hority, credibility, trust and authenticity. Authority. The determination of whose agreement or disagreeme nt is most useful amounts to determining the authority of a particular source. The most widely cited concept of authority is that of cognitive authority , which Patrick Wilson described as influence on th oughts by a 39 knowledgeable source that is worthy of belief (Frit ch 2007). Websites with hig h authority may be more likely to be accurate, and those with low authority may help ide ntify misinformation (Fritch & Cromwell). For example, a claim is more likely to be accurate if it appears in a respected newspaper or on the website of a respected medical organization, wh ile it is more likely to be misinformation if it appears on conspiracy websites or websites with a p olitical bias, but does not appear elsewhere. Authority by itself has notable limitations as a pr edictor of misinformation. For example, sources could be given false authority, an d authoritative sources can be wrong. Likewise, the authority of a source is a macro leve l analysis that might be a poor criterion for any particular piece of information. For example, the authority granted The New York Times might differ from the authority granted any particular ar ticle, let alone any comment in response to an article. Furthermore, totalitarian regimes would s eem to have authority, but can also be sources of disinformation. Yet without the concept, no ev aluation of misinformation could be complete. For traditional, paper publishing, there are estab lished criteria for determining the authority of a source, including information about its author and publisher, but these criteria are not as applicable to the Internet, primarily becaus e they are not as easy to determine (del Giudice, 2010; Fritch & Cromwell, 2001; Rieh & Belk in, 1998). As criteria for determining the authority of online sources specifically, Fritch an d Cromwell suggest author competence and trustworthiness, document validity and author affil iation, the detection of all of which is not always easy on the Internet. For Rieh (Rieh, 2002; Rieh & Belkin), the concept of authority is close to credibility, for the cognitive authorities we recognize are those we find credible. Indeed, Savolainen (2007) observes that cognitive authority is the concept favored by information scientists to describe what communications scholars call credibility. It is, in fact, in the literatu re 40 explicitly exploring credibility that the criteria for evaluating cognitive authority are best articulated. Credibility. As a proxy for accuracy, credibility is imperfect. Fogg and Tseng (1999) equate credibility with believability. This definition is problematic for understanding misinformation, however, in that presumably misinformation is belie vable to those who believe it. Similarly, credibility is of course not the same as accuracy, and refers only to perception and not any kind of objective correspondence to the truth. As Rieh and Danielson (2007) note, \"credibility assessment is inherently a matter of human judgment s and document attributes provide only the cues for such judgments\" (p. 343). In addition, a credible source can still make mistakes or even deceive. Credibility describes an information sour ce that usually contains true information, but it does not mean any particular thing is true. On the other hand, credibility is important to accuracy in that if a source is not perceived as cr edible (predictive judgment, Taraborelli, 2008) it will not be consulted (evaluative judgment) rega rdless of whether or not its information is accurate. A large body of scholarly studies examines the cri teria that users adopt when evaluating the credibility of information (Ambre et al., 1997; del Giudice, Rieh & Danielson, 2007; Wathen & Burke ll, 2002). While there is much overlap between the criteria used by different studies, the re is also much variation, and a list of who adopts which criteria would be both voluminous and incomplete. For example, Del Giudice's (2010) most cited criterion (credentials) was emplo yed by only 72% of her subjects. It appears that none of these criteria was used by even close to 100% of users. Furthermore, it is difficult to 41 determine whether terms used in different studies\u2014s uch as bias, fairness and objectivity\u2014are synonymous or distinct from one study to the next. Certain interesting trends emerge, however, as to which criteria are frequently used and which rarely. Among the most commonly cited criteria are accuracy and bias. Thus, there is circularity inherent in using credibility as a prox y to evaluate accuracy, since accuracy is one criterion for credibility. Furthermore, most of th e studies offer no insight into how subjects determined the accuracy of the information, even wh en they identified it as a criterion. Bias, however, is likely to be a major cause of misinform ation, and a major factor in how information consumers evaluate misinformation. How these consu mers gauge the bias of others, especially in light of their own biases, is a crucial element of this investigation. Not surprisingly, the subjects of many user studies reported using the author's identity, his or her credentials or expertise, and any percei ved goals or objectives as criteria for evaluating credibility. The currency of information is also f requently cited, presumably on the assumption that information that has not been recently updated is unlikely to be correct. Likewise, information that is perceived to be complete and/or comprehensive was also perceived to be credible, presumably because omissions can be misle ading and suggest insufficient understanding of the topic. Many of the studies had more unexpected or confusin g results. Some criteria that would seem to correlate strongly with accuracy, such as e ditorial review (Ambre et al., 1997) and validation by other sources (Metzger, 2007; Metzger et al., 2003), were almost never identified as criteria that real information seekers actually use. In addition, many of the criteria seem dangerously tautological, such as the use of reliab ility, believability and trustworthiness as criteria for credibility. Relevance and utility we re often noted, but it is difficult to see how they 42 affect credibility per se, since a website giving h ealth advice could be entirely irrelevant to a search for political news, but nonetheless be perfe ctly credible. Perhaps most surprisingly, aesthetic design features of websites were among th e criteria most commonly used by information seekers in these studies. Intuitively, it seems quite unlikely that such factors would correlate with accuracy, or even with credibility. Yet use of these criteria for evaluation is quite common, including in the Fogg et al. (2003) study, where design look was the most frequently mentioned criterion. Interestingly, Kubiszewski et al. (2011), who divided the various criteria into a \"credibility factor\" consisting of criteria relating to authorship and content, and a \"presentation factor,\" consisting of design feature s, applied a statistical analysis which found that the credibility factor was significant, but not the presentation factor. In addition, Ahmad et al. (2010) found that aesthetics mattered more to inexp erienced computer users. It is interesting to consider how often aesthetic criteria were employed , given that such criteria are unlikely to correlate with accuracy. In addition to criteria, Wathen and Burkell (2002) were able to rank the perceived credibility of various sources of medical informati on. Doctors were trusted most, followed by mass media, other health professionals and health p ublications. However, doctors may not rank as highly among those doubting the safety of vaccin es. In a related finding, Casiday, Cresswell, Wilson & Panter-Brick (2006) observed that \"parents made a distinction between 'doctors' and 'my doctor,' trusting their own doctors far more th an the medical establishment\" (p. 181). Among institutions in the Wathen and Burkell study, consumer advocacy groups were perceived as the most credible, as were famous organizations such as the Mayo Clinic. The study also found some distrust of government sources, and a ge neral distrust of corporations, especially pharmaceutical companies. Findings such as these s uggest that vaccine safety beliefs might 43 derive from a preference for information from one s ource, such as an advocacy group, over another, such as the government. Notably, many of these credibility evaluations are not information-level evaluations. Rather, they are evaluations of the source of infor mation. Indeed, credibility judgments are often based upon trust, a key element of which is that tr ust in information is based on an assessment of trust in the source of the information (Lucassen & Schraagen, 2011). Trust. As with direct and indirect evidence, the best way to form trust is to have personal experience with the person trusted. In this way, a trustor may evaluate trust by inferring the underlying motives of the trustee, by identifying c ommon goals and values, or by forming an emotional relationship (Engdahl & Lidskog, 2014; Ke lton et al., 2008). Of course, personal experience with the evaluator is not available in m any situations, leaving most people to rely on the personal experiences of others (Taraborelli, 20 08). Gilson (2003) distinguishes between trust in known individuals and trust in strangers or social systems, which Kelton et al. (2008) call soc ietal trust. This form of trust is an essential element of a functioning society, because without i t we could not engage in transactions with strangers (Kelton et al.; Granovetter, 1985). It is often based on shared norms and values. As we have noted, interpersonal trust may have greater in fluence than societal trust and has more complex motivations (Granovetter, 1973; Hall, 2004; Rogers, 2002). As Gilson notes, interpersonal trust can be based on a calculation t hat the trusted person is acting in one's interests, or on a prediction that the trusted pers on will act consistently with his or her history of behavior. Perhaps more important for misinformation , however, is what Gilson calls affective or altruistic voluntary trust, which is instinctual tr ust based on emotional ties with the trusted person 44 (see also Engdahl & Lidskog, 2014). Such bonds are likely to be the most persuasive, but as Granovetter (1985) notes, they are also the most su sceptible to abuse, and provide the basis for fraud and betrayal that would not be possible had n o trust been established. Quandt (2012) writes about the evolution of trust f rom interpersonal structures into network structures. In pre-modern societies, Quand t notes, information was most efficiently shared face-to-face, but as societies grew increasi ngly complex such efficiencies broke down and the need for information and knowledge intermediari es grew. This necessitated the rise of centralized information institutions (i.e. the medi a) and subsequently \"an extension of the concept of 'trust' towards institutions\" (p. 12). Ironically, as societies grew still more complex, they fragmented into subgroups, and those centraliz ed media hierarchies had an increasingly difficult time meeting the information needs of the population's diverse interests. As media became networked, Quandt argues, trust began to evo lve: In contrast to the generalized trust directed towar ds institutions... 'network trust' is based on an accumulated perception of 'personalized,' ind ividual trust. Users of social media generally do not expect the participants of social media to have a hidden agenda or to be 'puppets' of a larger institutionalized entity in t he background...The background of the participants in social media is not expected to be a uniform one - even though individuals might have certain interests and might be influence d by third parties, this is expected to be levelled out by the difference of voices in the 'networked' discussion... This widespread idealized notion of networked communicat ion and network trust seems to miss some problems of social media and a 'participa tory' network society - leading to a rather contradictory situation, where trust is give n to mostly unknown, anonymous voices 45 on the web, whereas there is a lingering suspicion that institutionalized media are manipulative and not trustworthy (p. 14-15). Notably, this network trust returns to the interper sonal trust of pre-modern societies, although it is now heavily mediated. Metzger et al. (2010) found network trust manifeste d in \"social information pooling,\" which is commonly relied upon by Internet users eva luating credibility. New technologies for interpersonal connectivity and information aggregat ion create opportunities to supplement or replace single, hierarchical authorities with \"mult iple distributed authorities based on... networks of peers\" (p. 415). In other words, traditional to p-down evaluations based on authoritative experts are increasingly giving way to bottom-up ev aluations based on collective opinion. The use of such technologies was common throughout the multiple focus groups in the Metzger et al. study. This was particularly true of testimonials from \"real people,\" such as product reviews, which some participants described as personalizing the evaluation. On the other hand, other subjects of the study felt that such testimonials d eserved greater skepticism because of the difficulty of evaluating the identity, credentials and other important information about the source. For similar reasons, blogs, wikis, social networkin g sites and particularly Wikipedia were viewed with skepticism by Metzger et al.'s subjects. Importantly, most systems discussed in the study, and most such systems in general, are employed to evaluate products and vendors, not the veracity of information. Nonetheless, the idea of collaborative evaluation is likely to be of some use to a study of vaccine safety beliefs, particularly on the Internet. To begin with, these kinds of systems are used online to evaluate potential sources of vaccine information such as pe diatricians and books, and to determine the prominence of certain information in news feeds and search results. 46 While trust is also not the same as accuracy, and s omeone that we trust can mislead or even deceive us, there is an essential association between the two concepts in that we judge to be accurate that which we trust. Indeed, we use trust as a means of judging accuracy more than we use verification, largely because of constraints on time and effort. If we have come to trust our local newspaper, for example, we tend to believe wh at we read there is accurate, and rarely if ever verify it. On the other hand, as with credibi lity, trust is based on perception. Like credibilit y but unlike accuracy, trust is not an inherent or ob jective characteristic, but is instead an external evaluation. People evaluate trust not by evaluatin g content as much as by evaluating behavior and the judgments of others about that behavior. Authenticity. A final potential proxy for accuracy might be deriv ed from archival theory, where the authenticity of a document is judged according to i ts provenance. Authenticity is not an explicit evaluation of content, however, but rather of wheth er a document is what it purports to be. Like the other proxies, these methods do not evaluate th e accuracy of the information itself, but certain circumstances of creation might improve the probability that a document's contents are accurate. For example, the circumstances of the cr eation of an article in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, an article in a major newspaper , and an entry on an amateur writer's blog may all suggest different probabilities of the accuracy of their content. Indeed, authenticity is often a good means of determining cognitive authority, as a mong the considerations of an archival analysis are who authored a document, the purpose f or which it was authored, and in what capacity the author served (Duranti, 1998). Yet au thenticity is not limited to authorship alone, for as Fallis (2008) notes, \"We typically trust a p articular encyclopedia entry not because we trust its author but because we trust the process b y which the entries in the encyclopedia are 47 produced\" (p. 1667). It is exactly the process of production that is at the heart of most evaluations of provenance (Duranti). In essence, as Duranti (1998) puts it, the authenti city of material \"is determined by the juridical system in which it was created, by the pe rson concurring in its formation and their competence, and by the actions, transactions, proce sses and procedures which generated it\" (p. 183). The more an information consumer can determi ne about the circumstances that created information, therefore, the higher the probability that he or she can recognize misinformation when it occurs. While these principles originate in the authenticat ion of paper records, they have been applied to the authentication of electronic records as well. To begin with, archivists consider some of the same elements of electronic records, su ch as the medium, content, format, initiating actions and the people involved in the creation. M eanwhile, electronic records also allow for the consideration of additional factors such as metadat a, which may help to determine time, date, place, and even revision history (MacNeil, 2000). In practice, however, such factors have often proven difficult to determine about content on the Internet. These methods also identify authenticity only at one specific point in time, an d therefore cannot account for the fluid nature of Internet content (Roeder, Eppard, Underwood & La uriault, 2008). In summary, none of these proxies perfectly equates with accuracy; they merely suggest it. As a result, no combination of these criteria amounts to a foolproof means of identifying misinformation. Rather, information consumers are likely to consider that each or all of these criteria increases the probability of a proposition being true, so that more authority, credibility, trust, and authenticity, when combined, amount to a greater chance that the information is accurate. Caution is necessary in determining exac tly how these criteria combine, however, 48 since the combination of concepts can result in cir cularities of definition, as for example, authority is partly defined as having credibility, credibility includes accuracy, and so on. Such terms are often used as synonyms, so we must be car eful not to create artificial separations between them in order to combine concepts that are not entirely distinct. Most importantly, accuracy is the only one of these criteria that aims to evaluate information itself. The other measures - authority , credibility, trust, and authenticity -are characteristics of information sources, not informa tion content. In addition, while the research that studies how users evaluate these factors provi des useful insight about important characteristics of information sources, it does not address the question of belief. Saying something like \"I find this particular website cred ible because of factor A and factor B\" is not the same as saying something like \"I don't believe this particular claim for reason A and B.\" The former is a general impression of quality, while th e latter is a specific judgment regarding truth or falsity. Existing studies of users' evaluations enumerate evidence that users consider, but those studies insufficiently address why that evidence is preferred, and in particular why others might reject that same evidence. Also, on a macro level, such studies do not address the rejection of consensus belief. Nonetheless, they p rovide important building blocks in understanding the process of misinformation. The p resent study, therefore, can expand on this research by examining specific beliefs and the spec ific evidence considered to support them. Vaccine Safety There is considerable previous research about what people believe about vaccine safety (Alfredsson, Svensson, Trollfors & Borres, Brown et al., 2010; Casiday 2006; Hermannson & 2005; Davies et al., 2008; Kata, Fairhead Cassell, 2005; Ramsay, Yarwood, Campbell Saa da, Zikmund-Fisher & Wittenberg, 2014; al., Gr een, Venkatraman et al. 2015; Wolfe, Sharp & Lipsky, 2002; Woo et al., 2004; Zimmerman, et al., 2005). Certain recurring themes emerge from these studies, about which more will be said in Chapter 4. The articulated reasons for negative at titudes toward vaccines include, among others, that vaccines contain dangerous chemicals, that chi ldren receive too many vaccines at once, that the risk of the vaccine is greater than the risk of the disease, and that the advice of medical professionals is compromised by relationships with pharmaceutical companies. Importantly, these studies identify what some people believe abo ut vaccines, but not the reasons for those beliefs. They are studies of what is believed but not of why it is believed. In particular, these studies do not investigate the evidence their subje cts consulted, nor the evaluation of that evidence. These studies therefore provide us with a nice basis of beliefs, leaving us to investigate the justification. Fear of vaccinations is not a new phenomenon. A mo vement formed in opposition to the smallpox vaccine in the 19 th century (Bellaby, 2003; Downs et al., 2008; Schwar tz, 2012; Wolfe & Sharp, 2002). Some scholars have noted that the general concerns about vaccine safety have remained consistent throughout the history of vacci nes (Schwartz; Wolfe & Sharp; Zimmerman et al., 2005). These include the idea that vaccina tion is unnatural, that it is unnecessary with 50 proper hygiene, that vaccines cause more harm than good, that vaccine science is not to be trusted, and that vaccine mandates violate civil li berties. As Schwartz puts it The core arguments of critics of vaccination contin ue to parallel those expressed for nearly 200 years...What has changed are the ways in w hich parents, scientists, physicians, and others skeptical or critical of vac cines communicate and collaborate... today's critics of vaccines are part of national an d international networks that have capitalized on the explosive growth of information technologies in the past quarter- century (p. 52). Clearly, anti-vaccination sentiment predates the In ternet, and even 20 th century mass media. Nonetheless, studies of the relationship between th e media and vaccine beliefs have shown compelling correlations (Smith, Ellenberg, Bell & R ubin, 2008) and that the media gives balance to vaccine-negative content disproportionate to pop ular sentiment and the scientific consensus (Schwartz, 2012). This is particularly true on the Internet (Betsch, 2011; Betsch et al., 2012; Betsch et al., 2010; Davies et al., 2002; Kata, 201 2). Vaccine resistance has certainly received prominent coverage in the media. Some attribute the modern anti-vaccination movement to a 1982 television program entitled \"DPT: Vaccine Roulette\" which apparently lowered DPT (dip htheria-pertussis-tetanus) vaccination rates (Kata, 2012; Schwartz, 2012). So many person al injury lawsuits ensued that vaccine manufacturers threatened to stop producing vaccines and the U.S. Congress created a separate vaccine court (Kata). In perhaps the highest profil e recent appearance, in 2008 the actress and model Jenny McCarthy, the mother of a child once di agnosed with autism, appeared on CNN'S Larry King Live and The Oprah Winfrey Show advocating for vaccine reforms (Gross, 2009). That same year, she and her then-boyfriend, megasta r Jim Carrey, led the \"Green Our Vaccines\" 51 rally (Brady & Dahle, 2008). During the 2009 outbr eak of H1N1 \"swine\" flu, fears of the vaccine's safety were the subject of frequent repor ts in the mainstream media. On September 26, 2009, the comedian Bill Maher tweeted, \"If u get a swine flu shot ur an idiot\" (Maher, 2009). In 2013, Katie Couric created a controversy by televis ing coverage of adverse reactions to the HPV vaccine that many criticized for having an unscient ific bias (Couric, 2013). During the 2012 Presidential primary campaign, candidate Michele Ba chmann called the HPV vaccine \"dangerous\" and linked it to mental retardation (Gr ady, 2011). Two expected Presidential candidates for the 2016 campaign, Rand Paul and Chr is Christie, also expressed sympathy with vaccine concerns (Peralta, 2015). These are only am ong the most well-publicized expressions of such concerns. In particular, refusal of the combined measles-mum ps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been prevalent for more than 15 years following the 1998 publication in the United Kingdom of a study that suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism (Wakefield et al., 1998), and the ensuing international media coverage (Kata, 201 2; Schwartz, 2012). Notably, the Wakefield et al. paper itself states, \"We did not prove an as sociation between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described\" (p. 641). Rath er, it notes that parents of eight of the twelve children in the study reported a temporal associati on between the MMR vaccine and autism symptoms. Nonetheless, media coverage of the paper emphasized the link between vaccines and autism, as did Dr. Wakefield himself (Moore & Stilg oe, 2009). Subsequently, a number of allegations of research m isconduct were made against Andrew Wakefield, the lead author of the 1998 study. In 2 004, a statement by the editors of The Lancet, the journal in which the Wakefield et al. study had appeared, detailed the various deficiencies (Horton, 2004a, 2004b). In the same issue, The Lancet published a retraction by most of the 52 original authors of the study (Wakefield himself di d not retract) stating that, \"no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the d ata were insufficient\" (Murch et al., 2004). Subsequent investigations by the British Me dical Journal found such significant misconduct, including fabricated data, that Wakefie ld has been stripped of his license to practice medicine (Dominus, 2011). Since the 1998 Wakefield study, numerous studies ha ve shown no relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism (Gerber & Offit, 2009). What initially aroused suspicion of a link between autism and environmental factors was data t hat from the 1980's to the mid-1990's, the rate of autism diagnosis increased nearly 400% (Mil ler & Reynolds, 2009). The most recent data predicts autism rates as high as 1 in 68 ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2 015 ). However, many doctors attribute this increase to a change in the definition and diagnosis of autism (Lingam et al., 2003). During the same peri od, the rate of MMR vaccination remained fairly constant (Miller & Reynolds). In Japan, in cidences of autism increased even after the MMR vaccine was completely withdrawn (Honda, Shimiz u & Rutter, 2005). The contrary evidence has not eliminated opposition to vaccines. Although concerns about the MMR vaccine were well-p ublicized, there are other concerns about vaccines. Shortly after the publicat ion of the Wakefield study, an additional hypothesis emerged about the use of thimerosal, a p reservative that contains mercury in vaccines (Blaxill, Redwood & Bernard, 2004). Subsequent res earch has revealed that, while methylmercury can accumulate in the brain and damag e it, thimerosal contains ethylmercury which is metabolized and cleared from the body with out damage (Gerber & Offit, 2009; Gross, 2009; Miller & Reynolds, 2009; ). The articulated mission of McCarthy's \"Green Our Vaccines\" rally was to reform vaccine in gredients and the recommended schedule, 53 which is perceived as \"too many, too soon.\" These concerns with the schedule have themselves been refuted by scientific evidence (Gerber & Offit , 2009; Hilton et al., 2006). One of the oldest objections to vaccination is resi stance to government vaccine mandates. The first compulsory vaccination requirements began in 1853 and caused violent riots and the founding of anti-vaccination organizations (Wolfe & Sharp, 2002). According to Schwartz (2012) enforcement of such laws \"disproportionately targeted the working-class and poor with fines and jail terms for noncompliance\" (p. 51), wh ich partly motivated an 1898 change in the laws allowed conscientious objection, the predecess or of the modern personal belief exemption to vaccine requirements (Schwartz). Today in the U nited States, all 50 states have vaccination mandates, but 48 allow exemptions based on religiou s beliefs, personal beliefs, or both (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2015). Californi a currently allows exemptions for both reasons, but in the wake of the Disneyland measles outbreak, new legislation has been proposed to remove the exemptions (Pan & Allen, 2015). Inter estingly, California is among the states whose mandates were successfully repealed in the 19th century (Wolfe & Sharp). In recent years, vaccination rates have declined an d vaccine-preventable diseases have increased, suggesting that many people remain uncon vinced that vaccines are safe. Betsch (2011) notes that \"as a consequence of suboptimal v accination coverage the World Health Organization (WHO) failed to reach the goal to elim inate measles until 2010; the new target is measles elimination by 2015\" (p. 1). In California , vaccination exemptions due to personal beliefs have reached record levels (Lin & Poindexte r, 2009; Mohajer & Kumar, 2011). Simultaneously, California has also seen the highes t number of measles cases in the United States (Gorman, 2011), even before the highly publi cized outbreak of measles originating in Disneyland at the end of 2014. Since measles vaccin ations began, reported measles infections in 54 the United States had decreased from about 500,000 cases and 500 deaths per year to a few dozen per year (Gross, 2009; Miller & Reynolds, 200 9). Some cite a reduction of greater than 99% in reported cases in the U.S. due to the measle s vaccine (Amanna & Slifka, 2005). Overall, it appears that the scientific consensus h as grown stronger while the acceptance of it has declined. In particular, the prevalence of vaccine skepticism in California makes this an ideal case for the study of misinformation. It in volves a well-educated population rejecting scientific consensus, and is often concentrated in discrete pockets that make it easier to observe (Baum, 2014). 55 CHAPTER THREE METHODOLOGY Purpose of the Study The findings of previous studies of beliefs about v accines leave unanswered the question of how those beliefs are formed. How exactly does someone come to believe that vaccines are safe or dangerous? What information does that beli ever use, and how does he or she evaluate that information? Why does someone choose to belie ve one piece of information but not another? The focus of the study has not been to determine th e correctness or incorrectness of any particular information, belief or claim about vacci ne safety. Rather, the focus has been to understand what people believe about vaccine safety , pro or con, and in particular how and why they believe it. Hence the study is based on four research questions : Research Questions RQ1: What evidence do people rely on for their beli efs about vaccine safety? RQ2: What evidence about vaccine safety do they acc ept and what evidence do they reject? RQ3: How do they account for their acceptance or rejection of any particular piece of evidence? RQ4: What is the influence of the Internet on bel iefs about vaccine safety? Procedures The study is based primarily upon a qualitative co ntent analysis of information available on the Internet about vaccine safety, supplemented by exploratory interviews with parents of school-aged children about their own vaccine safety beliefs. The content analysis examined information publicly available on the Internet abou t vaccine safety, the evidence for and against 56 vaccine safety, and indications of how people with various vaccination beliefs have evaluated that evidence. In interviews, parents of children from two Los Angeles schools were asked to discuss their beliefs about vaccine safety and how they formed those beliefs. The interviews served to supplement the findings of the Internet a nalysis with original data collected offline and in live interaction with the author. Both the Inte rnet data and the interviews included people holding pro-vaccination and anti-vaccination belief s, including a spectrum of beliefs in between. The focus of data analysis in this study was on the ways that people describe, evaluate and contextualize information that they present as evidence to support their beliefs. A major assumption here is that in online comments and argu ments, people support their beliefs using the same sort of evidence that they find personally com pelling and use in their offline interactions. Definitions The operationalization of terms for this study is r ooted in preceding literature as discussed in Chapter 2. \"Belief\" is defined as the treatment of a propositi on as if it were true (Gilbert, 1991). \"Evaluate\" is defined as assessing information to form or justify a belief. \"Evidence\" is defined as that which is assessed in forming a belief. To \"accept\" evidence means to decide that it is co nsistent with, supports or strengthens one's own belief in a proposition. To \"reject\" evidence means to decide that it is in consistent with, does not support, weakens, or does not influence one's own belief in a proposition. 57 Internet Thematic Analysis Data Collection The collection of Internet content employed an esse ntially purposive method, seeking data from the most relevant and accessible sources. Again, this data included both materials that support vaccination and vaccine safety and material s that oppose vaccination or question its safety. Because of the interest of this study in t he influence of Internet-based information on beliefs, only Internet-based content on vaccine saf ety was collected and analyzed, rather than content from other media sources. Books, other pri nt materials, broadcast programs and similar content on the subject were not included, except to the extent that such content is routinely available on the Internet to the average consumer. The principle of this collection strategy was to seek information using the same means that a typ ical Internet user is likely to employ when investigating the simple question, \"Are vaccines sa fe?\" Hence the collection did not include sophisticated strategies, lesser known tools, or ac ademic literature inaccessible to the average consumer. In August 2013, two searches were conducted using the Google search engine, one using the query \"vaccine safety\" and one using the query \"vaccines autism.\" All links in the first three pages of results were followed, and the resulting w eb page was saved as HTML and printed to PDF. During analysis, this initial material was su pplemented using a kind of Internet version of snowball sampling. When links within the original material appeared relevant, they were clicked and, if determined to be relevant, downloaded and p rinted to PDF. Likewise, many times when the original data referred to external sources that seemed relevant, those sources were retrieved, and when claims were unsubstantiated or unrefuted e lsewhere in the data, additional material (e.g. medical websites) was consulted in order to u nderstand the consensus and controversy 58 about those claims. During this \"snowball\" collect ion, material was added to the data corpus based entirely on the author's perception of its re levance to the research questions. This method resulted in the capture of 152 PDF file s which were subsequently numbered consecutively. The captured data totaled more than 1500 pages and included formal websites of health organizations and advocacy organizations, bl og entries, news articles, and an Amazon.com page for a book about vaccine safety, as well as a significant corpus of user comments. The data collected in August 2013 stretches back s everal years before 2013, but also reflected current issues and controversies. At abo ut the time of the data collection, two relevant news items were circulating through the Internet. The first was a court in Italy having ruled in favor of plaintiffs seeking compensation for vaccin e damage. The second was the addition of Jenny McCarthy to the cast of the popular morning s how \"The View.\" These topical news items were shared across several new sites and blogs in t he data. While the prevalence of these items in the data may be overrepresented compared to data collected at different times, the tropes and themes identified during data analysis do not seem dependent upon these stories, since those same themes occur in earlier data, are common in pr evious literature (as discussed in Chapter 4) and have continued to be prominent in vaccine safet y discourse up to and including subsequent developments such as the Disneyland measles outbrea k around the end of 2014 (California Department of Public Health, 2015). While subseque nt data has not been officially considered in this analysis, subsequent news developments have be en monitored and determined to be consistent with the findings of this study. 59 Data Analysis A thematic analysis was performed on the material collected from the Internet in four rounds. All analysis and categorizing were conduct ed by the author. One focus of the analysis was simply to identify the evidence itself. What e vidence is cited? What beliefs does it support or refute? A second focus of analysis was to ident ify articulated reasons for accepting or rejecting any particular evidence. Particular atte ntion was paid to refutations and disagreements, as well as to explicit citations of the sources of evidence. The most interesting and illuminating data was fou nd in the comments posted on websites by readers. Here, beliefs about vaccine s afety are articulated and defended. The usefulness of user comments in addressing these res earch questions was not anticipated during the initial design of this study, but other researc hers have observed their suitability for the exploration of similar issues (Jaspal, Nerlick & Ko teyko, 2013; Shanahan, 2010). As and Medvedeva (2014) have noted Because online commenters respond to science news u sing words that signify their beliefs about science and its practices, online com ments are uniquely suitable for exploring how readers, through their cultural lense s, perceive the relationship among science, the individual, and society\" (p. 779). Also, while online comments do not illustrate the r eal-time process of forming any particular beliefs, they often contain evidence in support of beliefs. Given the classic definition of knowledge as \"justified true belief\" (Fallis, 2006; Furner, 2010), it seems appropriate to analyze online comments as examples of how people justify t heir beliefs, and thereby gain insight into their knowledge claims. 60 To this end, the first round of analysis highlight ed two kinds of passages: those articulating or implying beliefs about vaccine safe ty and those articulating or implying means of evidence evaluation. These passages were marked re gardless of whether they were pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and no such distinction was made a t this stage. For example, this example from the data was highlighted as shown: The highlighted areas reflect either a belief about vaccine safety (e.g. \"Vaccines indirectly cause autism\") or a reason for a belief (e.g. \"he was dis credited because our healthcare system is run on the all mighty dollar.\") The area left unhighlight ed was judged to be a digression from the topic of vaccine safety. During this initial analysis, certain patterns bega n to emerge. Several categories of beliefs about vaccine safety - what people believe - were identified, as were several categories of evidence evaluation - how people believe. These same categories recurred over and over throughout the data. 61 During a second round of analysis, those passages h ighlighted in the first round were marked according to the identified categories. The categories are discussed in detail in Chapters 4 and 5. Beliefs identified in the data were as fo llows: A. Beliefs about the premise of vaccination B. Beliefs about toxicity C. Beliefs about what is \"natural\" D. Beliefs about cumulative effects E. Beliefs about compromised integrity F. Beliefs about civil liberties/civic responsibility G. Beliefs about autism: a. Increasing diagnosis or change in definition of aut ism b. Time at which symptoms appear c. Genetic component Evaluation strategies identified in the data were a s follows: A. Authority B. Risk/benefit C. Personal experience and emotion D. Claims of self-evidence E. Reason So, for example, if a passage articulated a belief that vaccine ingredients were toxic because of the number of shots given, it would be categorized as containing both beliefs about toxicity and beliefs about the cumulative effects of vaccines. If the passage then related an anecdote about the commenter's child, it would be categorized as u sing personal experience as an evaluation 62 strategy. The example given above was categorized as containing beliefs about compromised integrity (\"ci\") and the evaluation tactic of autho rity (\"a\"): In addition to categories of belief and categories of evaluation, data analysis revealed a pattern of the use of similar evaluation tactics on opposing sides of the debate. Observations of this phenomenon were marked as a separate category in the data, in addition to being marked as whatever category of evaluation was exhibited. For example, when an Internet user cited scientific evidence in order to question the safety of vaccines, this passage was classified as an example of authority as an evaluation strategy and also as an example of the use of similar tactics on opposing sides of the debate, since a popular co nception of the controversy is that scientific authority is only used in support of pro-vaccinatio n beliefs. This use of similar tactics on opposing sides is discussed more thoroughly in Chap ter 6. Post type and size varied greatly, and thus a unifo rm measure of a single post was not possible. Some of the analyzed data appears in lon g blog posts or news articles, and some in user comments sections. Even within comments secti ons, some posts are paragraphs long and 63 some are merely a sentence. In addition, a single user comment may have multiple examples of a particular evaluation strategy. Therefore, there is no relationship between the number of times a category was identified and the number of users o r of posts it represents. A third round of analysis identified particularly i llustrative quotations in the categorized data, noting the PDF and page number of particularl y strong examples of each identified category. For example, fifteen specific quotations about the cumulative effects of vaccines were marked as being particularly good examples of those beliefs. Also, during this round, subtle variations within each theme became evident, such t hat citations to the data were grouped into subcategories under the main categories marked in r ound two. For example, passages that had been categorized as demonstrating beliefs about the cumulative effects of vaccines were further grouped into subthemes according to whether the con cern was about combining multiple doses into a single shot or the receipt of too many vacci nes at too young an age. Then, illustrative quotations were matched to each of those ingredient s by citing the PDF number and page number. This resulted in the following section of the analysis table: Cumula tive effects ce Combined doses 24.3, 123.1, 130.13 -14, 130.18, 130.19, 132.19 Too many too soon 4.9, 16.7, 43.3, 69.13, 88.1 -2, 100, 108.2, 110.27, The gradations and variations within each category are elaborated in the analysis of results in Chapters 4 and 5. As a final round of analysis, the illustrative quot ations identified in the third round were marked as being pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine. For e xample, an anecdote about a child being vaccine-damaged would be categorized as anti-vaccin e because it was used as evidence of the dangers of vaccines. Some examples were also elimi nated at this stage as being inferior to other 64 examples. Accordingly, the examples identified in cumulative effects section of the analysis table were highlighted in green (pro-vaccine), red (anti-vaccine) or were eliminated (yellow.) Cumulative effects ce Combined doses 88.1 -2, 100 , 108.2 , 110.27, This enhanced the comparison of the use of each str ategy on opposing sides of the debate. Interviews Recruitment Interview subjects were parents of preschool and el ementary school children and were recruited through schools in Los Angeles County. Re cruitment and consent materials were approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board (se e Appendix A). Initially, schools were identified that had high rates of personal belief e xemptions from state mandated vaccination levels. However, recruitment proved unexpectedly d ifficult. In September 2012, the materials were presented to the principals of the two schools with the highest exemption rates according to the public records of the California Department of Public Health. Both principals declined to distribute recruitment materials to the parents of any of their students. Subsequently, in October 2012, three additional schools with low exemption r ates were approached. Two of them also declined to distribute materials to the parents of any of their students. An administrator for the third school, a preschool in Malibu, California, agreed to distribute recruitment materials. The administrato r also requested that she herself be able to participate, citing her own strong suspicions about the safety of vaccines. When she distributed the materials, no parents agreed to participate in the research. The administrator herself was the first interview subject, in the fall of 2012. Afte r that interview, she personally contacted four mothers of students from the school, three of whom ultimately participated in interviews. The 65 administrator subsequently noted that she had selec ted mothers whom she knew to have diverse views on vaccination. One interview subject was st rongly pro-vaccination, one was strongly anti-vaccination, and one had moderate views. Given the difficulty in recruiting interview subjec ts, a sixth school was approached not based upon its vaccination rates, but rather based upon its core mission as a site for education research involving its students. At this school, t hree mothers consented to interviews. A few others expressed interest in participating, but the n failed for unknown reasons to respond to scheduling requests. Interestingly, although the r ecruitment materials made no reference to the preferred gender, beliefs or vaccine status of part icipants, all three consenting participants were women with at least some degree of skepticism about the safety of vaccines. In total, seven interviews were conducted between f all 2012 and spring 2013. All seven subjects were women, and only one had fully vaccina ted her children in accordance with the recommended schedule. Notably, other studies of beliefs about vaccine saf ety have encountered similar recruiting problems, including Moore and Stilgoe (2009) and L aClair et al. (2014), who state that, \"Recruitment of parent participation in this study was more challenging than initially anticipated. It is likely that a lack of trust and a fear of sti gmatization prevented other vaccine hesitant parents in the selected communities from stepping f orward\" (p. 32.) In contrast, many studies of vaccine safety beliefs cited in Chapter 2 successfu lly recruited participants in studies employing various methods, including interviews and focus gro ups. The difficulties in the present study may be attributable to the fact that the schools ap proached for the present study had been featured in various news articles about California vaccination rates, and thus their principals may have been unusually hesitant to participate in rese arch on the subject. Principals and parents may 66 also have been reluctant to participate in what the recruitment materials clearly identified as doctoral student research. Procedure All interviews were conducted in person by the auth or and video recorded. The interviews were semi-structured around the three ar eas of interest: beliefs, evidence and evaluations. The interview instrument in Appendix B served as the basis for all of the interviews, although the order of subjects followed the natural flow of conversation rather than the order of the instrument, which served more as a checklist of subjects to address. The interviewer freely adjusted to the responses of the interview subjects, and explored whatever line of questioning arose that was relevant to the resea rch concerns of this study. Initial questions sought basic information and atti tudes about vaccine safety. Once beliefs were identified, questions began to address the subject's reasons for those beliefs. Additional questions sought a general understanding of how parents might use the Internet to research vaccine safety. Of course, the interviewe e did not observe parents actually searching. Rather, the questions were designed to get a sense of parents general search practices and how they retrospectively accounted for their current be liefs. Analysis Analysis of the interview data began at the conclus ion of interviews in the spring of 2013, concurrently with the Internet content analysis. B ecause the issues and themes raised in the interviews corresponded broadly with those in the o nline content, a technique of detailed summarization (similar to that used to synopsize le gal depositions), rather than verbatim transcription, was employed in the first round of i nterview analysis. These summaries included all of the content of the interviews, but concisely paraphrased that content. General time 67 signature information was also included. Using thi s technique, interviews of 60 to 90 minutes were summarized in an average of seven single-space d pages each. For example, the following verbatim quotation from an interview (which is discussed in Chapter 5), And just like, you know, you put a fence up, \"Oh no , I'm sorry, you can only look at the waterfall, you can't go play in it,\" well, you're p rotecting them, but at the cost of their emotional and mental health. And it's the same wit h the vaccine. You're protecting them, protecting them, but at what cost? was summarized in the first round of analysis as Putting up a fence to say a child can only look at a waterfall but can't go play in it protects children at the cost of their emotional an d mental health. She thinks vaccines are the same, they protect children, but at what cost? Once Internet data analysis was complete, the inter view summaries were revisited in a second round of analysis, in light of the framework that emerged in the Internet data. The interview data was reevaluated in terms of its corr espondence with themes and relationships in the Internet data. The themes in both data sources were generally consistent, although certain elaborations of some themes in the online data did appear in the interview summaries. In these cases, interview passages were transcribed verbatim to help illustrate the discussion of findings. Limitations of the Study The major limitation of the study is that it does n ot actually observe its subjects forming beliefs or evaluating information. Rather, it obse rves how Internet users retrospectively justify the beliefs they have. However, it seems reasonable to assume that subjects' reasons for trusting particular information, and their opinion of that i nformation, are similar now to what they were when they formed the belief. If the evaluation of the information had changed, it is likely that the belief itself would have changed. Thus we can draw inferences about belief formation by observing belief justification, and particularly th e aspect of belief formation with which this 68 study is principally concerned, i.e. the use of evi dence. The aspects of belief formation that this study has not observed\u2014such as the progression from an unformed belief to a formed belief, or from disbelief to belief\u2014are also not the aspects o f belief formation about which this study is concerned. Furthermore, we must adopt some such pr oxy, since belief formation probably cannot be observed directly even by brain imaging t echnology. This is not a study of the evaluation of evidence at the first moment of evalu ation; it is a study of the stance toward evidence for beliefs already held. An additional limitation is that the sample observe d may be biased toward the most opinionated, as they are the most likely to express their opinions on the Internet and to agree to interviews (Quandt, 2012). This is acceptable beca use the sources from which the data were collected are likely to be similar to sources from which people seek information about vaccines. The high accessibility of the data sources suggests a likely relationship to the popular discourse about the subject, and the data is consistent with previous research on the subject, as discussed in Chapter 4. Also, the beliefs in the collected data were quite diverse, including extreme views and more moderate ones. The most extreme beliefs, such as the belief that vaccination is a government plot for population control, were not am ong the most common beliefs in the data, and every effort has been made in data analysis to describe the most prevalent trends rather than outlying anomalies. 69 CHAPTER FOUR WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE ABOUT VACCINE SAFETY Discussions about vaccine safety beliefs are often framed in binary terms as a disagreement between those who vaccinate and those who do not. Like most binaries, this framing oversimplifies a complex situation. While some people certainly reject all vaccines, others merely advocate for safety reforms. Still o thers have concerns about particular shots, the vaccination schedule, or other concerns. Some, of course, embrace wholeheartedly the safety and efficacy of vaccines and fully comply with doct ors' recommendations. Rather than a simple conflict between vaccinators and \"anti-vaxxers,\" th e data collected for this study suggests a more nuanced view of vaccine safety beliefs. Not all of the subjects of the study share all of the same concerns. Some subjects overtly reject one concern but embrace another. At the same time, there are many beliefs that recur over and over in the data. While there are patterns and associations between certain beliefs, exceptions to those patterns are also common. Rather than adopting a pro-vaccination or anti-vaccination worl dview, each believer seems to select from a group of beliefs those most compelling to him or he r. It is as if available beliefs about vaccine safety were arrayed in a buffet from which each bel iever selects what he or she wants. Most of the concerns that people have about vaccine safety relate to a fear that vaccines are toxic, a fear of the cumulative effect of vacci nes, doubts about the premise of vaccination, or a fear about compromised integrity that obscures va ccine dangers. Those who fear that vaccines are toxic tend to worry either that the vaccine con tains dangerous ingredients (such as mercury, aluminum or formaldehyde), or that the vaccine can cause health problems (such as autism). Those who fear the cumulative effect of vaccines wo rry either about the combination of multiple vaccines in one dose (such as measles-mumps-rubella or diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) or about the increasingly large number of vaccines given to children at a young age. Those who question 70 the premise of vaccines believe that vaccines are i neffective, that the diseases they prevent are not serious, that those diseases diminished before there was a vaccine for them, that the vaccine can give them the disease it purports to cure (such as with the flu vaccine), or that unvaccinated people are healthier than vaccinated ones. Those c oncerned about compromised integrity tend to believe that vaccines are very profitable and that this profitability discourages manufacturers, doctors, and government agencies from fully investi gating or revealing safety issues. Some also believe that interested parties hide the dangers of vaccines for fear of litigation, or even as part o f a secret plan for population control. Any particular person may have any combination of t hese beliefs. Some overtly reject one concern, such as mercury, while accepting anoth er, such as giving a child too many vaccinations too young. Some embrace all vaccines, others reject them all, and still others make case-by-case decisions based on the characteristics of a particular shot and a particular disease. Some trust their own doctor but not the medical com munity as a whole, while others believe that even agencies such as the Centers for Disease Contr ol, the Food and Drug Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics are compromised by financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Some beliefs seem to coincide with other s. For example, proponents of naturopathy and alternative medicine tend to fear the chemical ingredients of vaccines, while those distrustful of big corporations or of government institutions t end to worry about conflicts of interest and profit motives. Importantly, although such associa tions are observable in the data, this study has not attempted to calculate or otherwise investigate the strength of such correlations. Indeed, it appears that almost any combination of beliefs abou t vaccines can be found, even though the various combinations rarely if ever contain unique components. 71 The terminology that is usually used to describe va ccine safety beliefs often fails to capture the diversity of believers. In particular, the term \"anti-vaccination,\" which is probably the most common term, is one that many people skept ical of vaccine safety dislike, in that it implies they reject all vaccines, rather than havin g concerns about certain vaccines or certain aspects of the vaccine program. In turn, many peop le with concerns about the safety of vaccines describe vaccine supporters as \"vaccine bullies.\" In practice, many people insist that they are generally pro-vaccination while maintaining concern s about particular vaccines or about the schedule on which vaccines are given (Dannetun et a l., 2005; Saada et al., 2014). Instead, those questioning vaccine safety often refer to themselve s as non-vaccinators (who get no vaccines), selective vaccinators (who get some vaccines but no t others) or delayed vaccinators (who get vaccines later than is recommended) while referring to those who comply with the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatri cs as \"fully vaccinated.\" Needless to say, different beliefs motivate each of these diffe rent positions. The medical literature often refers to \"vaccine hesitancy\" and \"vaccine hesitant parents\" (LaClair et al., 2014; Saada et al., 2014; Schwartz, 2012). This term, however, suggest s indecision or a pause in vaccination, connotations inapplicable to a great number of peop le's Betsch (2011; Betsch et al., 2010; Betsch et al., 2012), refers t o negative beliefs and those who hold them as \"vaccine-critical.\" This term seems more aptly to allow for subtleties in negative beliefs about vaccine safety, but has no appropriate opposite in that \"vaccine-uncritical\" suggests a lack of thought that does not accurately describe many peop le who believe vaccines are safe. Other terms, such as \"vaccine supporter\" or \"vaccine advo cate,\" suggest a political stance for what is not always a political position. Likewise, the com mon term \"vaccine compliant\" describes behavior rather than belief, and mischaracterizes t wo groups of believers. First, people who 72 believe vaccines are safe may not be considered vac cine compliant if they have no children. Second, many parents who complied with the recommen ded vaccine schedule changed their views after what they perceived to be vaccine damag e to their child. To the extent, therefore, that ease of reference requires us to divide the de bate into two sides, we shall continue to use the common terminology of \"pro-vaccination\" and \"anti-v accination\" with the caveat that these terms oversimplify a richly complex situation and d escribe only single beliefs and not necessarily any group of beliefs or the views of an y particular believer. There is considerable previous research, principall y in the medical field, about what parents believe about vaccine safety. Numerous stu dies using various methods have been conducted in various countries investigating the re asons that people give for distrusting vaccines, especially the measles-mumps-rubella vacc ine (Alfredsson et al., 2004; Brown et al., 2010; Casiday et al., 2006; Cassell et al., 2006; D annetun, et al., 2005; Downs et al., 2008; Evans et al., 2001; Gellatly et al., 2005; Gellin et al., 2000; Hilton et al., 2007; Hilton et al., 2006; LaClair et al., 2014; Mills al., 2005; & et al., 2002; al., 2014; Sal mon et al., 2005; Serpell & Green, 2006; Woo et al., 2004). There are also several studies of vaccination infor mation and beliefs specifically on the Internet (Atlani-Duault et al., 2015; Betsch et al. , 2012; Davies al., Leas 2012; Venkatraman et al., 2015; Wolfe et al., 2002; Zimmerman, et al., 2005) The findings of the present study are broadly cons istent with those of previous studies. For ease of comparison to the present study, recurr ing tropes that emerge from previous studies are listed below. 73 A. Concerns about toxicity 1. The vaccine contains toxic or dangerous ingredients , such as thimerosal, aluminum, etc. 2. The vaccine can cause other diseases, such as autis m or SIDS. 3. The vaccine causes pain or has other side effects. B. Concerns about cumulative effects 1. Children receive too many vaccines, or receive them too soon. 2. It is dangerous to combine multiple vaccines into a single shot 3. Vaccines are a stress on a child's immune system. 4. The vaccine has other negative long term effects. C. Concerns about the premise of immunization 1. It is better to develop immunity naturally by getti ng the disease. 2. The disease the vaccine prevents is not serious. 3. The vaccine can cause the disease it purports to cu re. 4. The child cannot catch the disease because the chil d is healthy and/or lives in a healthy environment. 5. The vaccine does not protect from the disease, or t he immunity is temporary. 6. Homeopathic or alternative medicine practices prote ct the child better than vaccines. 7. Proper nutrition or vitamins can replace vaccines. D. Concerns about compromised integrity 1. Vaccine recommendations are motivated by quotas or other profit motives. 2. Vaccine recommendations are motivated by deals with drug companies. 74 3. Distrust of the government, official health agencie s, or a bad experience with the health profession. 4. Vaccines are personal choices and refusal of them i s a civil liberty. Notably, Wolfe and Sharp (2002) have tracked anti-v accination beliefs across history, and find most of the same beliefs recur throughout the histo ry of vaccines. For example, 19 th century complaints about the small pox vaccine included tha t it was worse than the disease and contained toxic chemicals, that compulsory vaccination denied parental rights, that profit was the main motivation, that the dangers were covered up, that immunity was temporary, that the vaccine was not effective, and that good health practices were more effective in preventing disease. Wolfe and Sharp document all of these beliefs in the 21 st century as well. Likewise, all of these beliefs recur repeatedly in the data collected for the present study. The most common themes in the present data are also common in the previous studies. While we shall ultimately distinguish variations in the b eliefs above, as well as identify additional beliefs, the primary and most common tropes in this data are also the primary and most common tropes in previous studies. In broad terms, those tropes can be grouped into the categories used in the list above: beliefs about toxicity, beliefs about cumulative effects, beliefs about the premise of immunization, and beliefs about compromi sed integrity on the part of vaccine proponents. Beliefs about Toxicity An almost ubiquitous anti-vaccination concern, and hence one that vaccine proponents repeatedly attempt to refute, is the belief that va ccines contain toxic ingredients or components. 75 One extremely common belief in the present data is that dangerous ingredients are added to vaccines, as articulated in this comment on an arti cle about vaccine safety 4: [4.1] Have you ever looked into the ingredients in the vaccines given to our children? The contain: formaldehyde, newly-declared carcinogenic by the FDA; aluminum, a neurotoxin; MSG, a neurotoxin; among other toxic pr eservatives. The levels of these toxins in some cases exceed the FDA 's own stardards for \"safe levels. \" We are pumping these poisons into our children in the name of heal th? ... It is unconscionable to require parents to pump these toxic cocktails into their ch ildren, beginning at birth. Note that this commenter uses the words \"neurotoxin \" (twice), \"toxic\" (twice), \"toxins\" and \"poisons.\" The danger implied in these words is ty pical of anti-vaccination framing. This is important to note because it is core to the belief being expressed. The mere presence of ingredients like aluminum and formaldehyde is not c ontroversial as they are indeed present in many vaccines. What separates pro-vaccine from ant i-vaccine stances is the belief that these ingredients are harmful in vaccines. As a commente r notes elsewhere: [4.2] That 's simply untrue - there are no \"toxins \" in vaccines at levels deemed harmful. Children get these same \"toxins \" in much higher levels in everyday life, and they d on 't suffer from that. It is also important to distinguish a common and s pecific belief about vaccine toxicity, as suggested by this demand from a blogger: [4.3] Could you please provide scientific justifica tion as to how injecting a human being with a confirmed neurotoxin is beneficial to human health and prevents disease? While the call for \"scientific justification\" is ex plored in Chapter 5, of note in this quotation, as well as in quotation 4.1 and throughout the data, i s the use of the term \"neurotoxin\" which emphasizes not merely the toxicity of the substance , but its particular threat to the brain. It is probable that this is a legacy of the alleged conne ction between vaccines and autism, as the data 4 The quotations used herein are cut-and-pasted dire ctly from the PDFs in the collected data. Any typo graphical or grammatical errors are from the original. Modifica tions to the original text are noted with ellipses or brackets as appropriate. 76 are rife with stories of brain damage that children suffer after receiving vaccines. This language suggests the very specific belief that the danger o f vaccines is a neurological danger. While this is far from the only concern about the toxicity of vaccines, it is certainly prevalent. These concerns about brain damage have particularl y been associated with the use of mercury as a preservative in some vaccines. After the publication of the Wakefield study (Wakefield et al., 1998) concerns centered on the m ercury content of the preservative thimerosal (Kennedy, 2005) that was used to prevent contaminat ion of multi-dose vials that were punctured by numerous needles each time a new dose was drawn. While there seems to be no disagreement that mercury is toxic, pro-vaccine bel iefs emphasize the safe dose in vaccines and the fact that it was never present in many vaccines (such as the MMR vaccine) and has been removed from most of the others: [4.4] Since 2001, no Thimersoal has been in any vac cine's for children under 6 yrs of age. For older children and adults, the amount of Thimerosal in a multi-dose vial is equal to eating a small Tuna Fish sandwich. So, since th imerosal hasn't been in children's vaccines since 2001 and the Autism rate has grown, no one can blame the vaccine's that young infants under 6 get. However, many people find these arguments unconvinc ing. Again, as is typical of vaccine safety beliefs, the reasons for concern about mercu ry in vaccines vary, though draw from a certain recurring set of beliefs: [4.5] \"The preservative in question isn't even used any more.\" It saddens me that press releases are still used as fact. Thimerosol preserv ative (ethyl mercury) is still used in seasonal flu and swine flu vaccines. It is still us ed in childhood vaccines and some antibiotics (ear drops) in \"trace\" amounts. [4.6] Thimerosal? Why was it taken off the shelves if it wasn't the cause of autism? I don't understand? If it didn't harm children they s hould have left it. Something is up, and nobody is confessing. 77 These are not the only debates about the safety of mercury. Pro-vaccine beliefs also distinguish between ethylmercury, which was used in vaccines and has been shown to metabolize quickly and leave the body, and methylme rcury, which is found in fish, does accumulate in the body, and is indeed known to be t oxic. However, anti-vaccine beliefs do not find this distinction reassuring: [4.7] I am a newly expectant mom, I have a 15 year old born on 1996, I did what I was told, had him vaccinated and he was SEVERELY damage d by the Ethel mercury in those vaccines. Mercury is mercury, it is an extremely da ngerous neuro -toxin and should not be injected in an under developed immune system. Mercu ry attacks the central nervous system and the brain In addition, Mercury is far from the only ingredie nt that is the subject of anti-vaccination beliefs. Another widely cited concern is the use o f aluminum as an adjuvant to increase the immune response to some vaccines: [4.8] Thimeresol was replaced with aluminum which i s just as dangerous to the neurological system, possibly responsible for the c ontinued rise in autism. [4.9] The preservative in vaccines have aluminum. B abies who follow the CDC immunization schedule are injected with nearly 5000 mcg of aluminum by 18 months of age! Scary thought? It's like injecting poison. Pro-vaccination beliefs about aluminum are similar to those about mercury, and center on the idea that aluminum occurs naturally in our environm ent in much higher doses than those present in vaccines: [4.10] Aluminum is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon, and it is the most abundant metal making up almost 9 percent of the earth's crust. Aluminum is found in plants, soil, water and air... While infants receive about 4.4 milligrams of aluminum in the first six months of life from vacci nes, they receive more than that in their diet. Breast-fed infants ingest about 7 milli grams, formula-fed infants ingest about 38 milligrams, and infants who are fed soy formula ingest almost 117 milligrams of aluminum during the same period. 78 Notably, even this claim is the subject of anti-vac cination beliefs: [4.11] However vaccine developers understand that a tiny amount of aluminum-salt, when injected as part of a vaccine, has very differ ent properties from when ingested. Of course, these are not the only concerns about t he toxicity of vaccines. While mercury, aluminum and formaldehyde appear to be the most con cerning ingredients, there are many others, which include aborted fetal tissue, monkey kidneys, animal DNA, cancer cells, and others. The concerns, furthermore, are not limited to the ingredients of vaccines, but to a general concern that vaccines do things to the human body t hat are harmful. Another manifestation of this is the belief that vaccines cause various illn esses and diseases. The diseases for which vaccines are sometimes blamed include cancer, diabe tes, asthma, ADHD and others. The mechanism by which vaccines cause these diseases is usually either identified as one of the existing concerns about vaccines (such as toxic ing redients or the cumulative effect of them) or is left unexplained and, it is claimed, under-resea rched. This is true even of the best-researched of these beliefs, the claim that vaccines cause aut ism. Autism Despite the positions of the major medical organiz ations that vaccines do not cause autism, the data collected for this study is still rife with claims that thimerosal causes autism, tha t the MMR vaccine in particular causes autism, that t he cumulative effect of vaccines causes autism, and many others. The CDC has tracked an in crease in the diagnosis rates of autism from 1 in 150 in the year 2000 to 1 in 68 in 2010 (CDC, 2015). This increase is a central concern of those doubting the safety of vaccines: [4.12] Common sense says there has to be a correlat ion....\"Fastest-growing developmental disability; 1,148% growth rate\" Vacci ne schedule in 1983 - 10 vaccines. Vaccine schedule 2013 - 36-38.....huh! and we are s eeing a growth rate of 1,148%!!!! THERE is your scientific research. Think for yourse lves people. 79 On the other hand, many people attribute this incre ase to a change in the criteria for diagnosis in the last few years: [4.13] Autism is on the rise because it is actually being diagnosed. 20,30,50 years ago, more than half these children would never have been dignosed with autism. Now that we are learning more about autism of course more child ren will be diagnosed. Nonetheless, even this is subject to the scrutiny o f anti-vaccine beliefs: [4.14] With all due respect, I was born in the 1950 's and I can say emphatically that there WERE NOT that many \"mentally deficient\" people of A NY kind. Not 1 in 50, not 1 in 100, not 1 in 200. SOMETHING accounts for the radic al increase in this kind of disorder, and I can assure you there has been a radical incre ase. You are reciting one of the favorite mantras of today's propaganda that vaccines and aut ism couldn't possibly be linked. Another common belief specific to the relationship between vaccines and autism relates to the point at which symptoms of autism appear in children. Anti-vaccination beliefs tend to arise from the observation that the appearance of s ymptoms closely follows the receipt of the vaccine: [4.15] How do you explain the countless examples of children who literally changed overnight immediately after receiving their inocula tion? Coincidence? Pro-vaccination beliefs, in contrast, see the coinc idence of the vaccine and the appearance of symptoms as a correlation that does not suggest cau sation (a phrase they very frequently use themselves): [4.16] its because autism with or without the vacci ne shows its symptoms at about 18 months. your child will appear to be developing no rmally and at 18 months you will get the first symptoms the child may even deteriorate. Another pro-vaccine belief specific to autism is t hat genetic components of autism have been identified in research: [4.17] If you had done any research, you would kno w that autism is a genetic condition. They've already found the allele that causes it. 80 [4.18] If it 's vaccines, then why are Boys are 5x more likely th an girls????? However, anti-vaccine ideas merely reframe this gen etic component as a genetic predisposition that a vaccine can trigger: [4.19] I don't know that the MMR vaccine was what c aused her Autism. I do believe that the MMR vaccine reaction triggered something. Wheth er some carry a genetic trait/gene/trigger that predisposes them to Autism with the MMR vaccine being what flips that switch needs to be researched further. C AUSE or TRIGGER? [4.20] I am a mom of 3 boys, my first developed aut ism within a couple weeks after his MMR vaccine.... my second son durastically changed wi thin a couple weeks after his MMR shot... my youngest was due to get his today, I d odged that one as quick as I could! its obvious I have that gene that reacts wi th MMR vaccine and I know what will happen if he is givin that shot and I wont do that to him! To summarize then, in this first category of vacci ne safety beliefs - beliefs about toxicity - we find two principal emphases. The first is an emphasis on the ingredients of vaccines, primarily mercury and aluminum but also others. Th e second emphasis is on the effects of vaccines upon the body, particularly their believed responsibility for a number of diseases, most famously autism. Debates about the causes of autis m, in turn, revolve around changes in diagnostic rates and criteria, timing of the appear ance of symptoms, and whether autism is a genetic condition or results from a genetic predisp osition for vaccine injury. While the present study has not attempted to quantify the prevalence of any particular beliefs, it is nearly self- evident that beliefs about toxicity would be the mo st common or at least among them. Indeed, in Kata's (2010) study of anti-vaccination websites, t he only information that appeared on 100% of the websites studied were beliefs that vaccines con tain poisons and that vaccines cause idiopathic illnesses. 81 Beliefs about Cumulative Effects Another extremely common set of beliefs about vacc ine safety has to do with the cumulative effects of combined shots or multiple sh ots and their perceived impact on the bodies of young children. Some people emphasize these bel iefs more than others such as concerns about toxicity, while other people hold the combine d belief that it is the cumulative effect of toxins that causes problems. Two different beliefs about cumulative effects are common in the collected data: beliefs about the safety of multip le vaccines combined into a single shot, and beliefs about the safety of the increased number of vaccines given to very young children. The former of these beliefs, about the safety of c ombining vaccines for multiple diseases into a single shot, such as the measles-mumps-rubel la vaccine (MMR) or the diphtheria-tetanus- pertussis vaccine (DTap), is less common in the col lected data, but was once among the chief concerns about the relationship between the MMR vac cine and autism. [4.21] There are no studies done on combination vac cines and how they react with one another. Not to mention any reactions with other e nvironmental, drug or food chemicals or toxins. This belief that the issue has been insufficiently researched is common in the debate. Indeed, as we shall discuss in Chapter 5, many believe vaccine safety is generally under-researched in many areas, not just with regard to combination vaccines . On the other hand, unsurprisingly, pro- vaccination views about combined doses include the belief that the research is sufficient and that the track record of such vaccines demonstrates thei r safety: [4.22] The combination shot hasn't been used in Jap an since 1993 and autism rates continued to rise. It's widely reported: [provides link] Regardless of whether the lack of research is true, many people believe it, and often complain that vaccine policies fail to take their concerns i nto account: 82 [4.23] Why remove the choice of the single shots if parents are concerned about the MMR? So you then have parents that would do the sho ts in single form but not the MMR. If it was about ensuring herd immunity this is a bad policy. Thinking like this, can you blame parents for not trusting? Note that in this quotation, which expresses a comm on sentiment, the commenter does seem to recognize the protections afforded by vaccines, so is not entirely \"anti-vaccination.\" Here, the concern is not with the overall safety of vaccines, but rather with the safety of a particular aspect of the vaccine and with the way the vaccine program has been implemented. (The concern with individual choice is also common, as we shall discu ss later.) This is at the heart of the set of concerns about cumulative effects, which are premis ed on the idea that the vaccine program was safer in the past, but has now been compromised by combined doses and changes in the schedule. In particular, this is the basis for the more comm only stated belief about the cumulative effects of vaccines that is often called the \"too m any, too soon\" issue. The number of vaccines in the schedule recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics has increased with the development of new vaccines and revised recommendat ions about existing vaccines. Reports of the size of this increase are inconsistent, and app ear to depend on the time frame used and how vaccines are counted (whether by disease, dose, or number of shots.) The medical community justifies this increase as the advancement of immun ology which is now able to prevent more diseases than it ever was before, and hence the inc reased number of vaccines means increased protection. Anti-vaccination beliefs, however, sug gest that the increased number of shots can overwhelm the underdeveloped system of infants and toddlers, resulting in vaccine damage. Consistent with a buffet arrangement of beliefs, \" too many, too soon\" beliefs have subtle variations. Most commonly, people express concern about the body being overloaded: 83 [4.24] My guess, and it's only a guess is that it's not so much the vaccines, as the mega cocktails of vaccines that children take these days . Could the body just need time and space to adjust to one vaccine at a time. It's onl y in recent years that these mega doses have been taken. [4.25] ...pumping so many vaccines into a babies imma ture immune system! The current schedule is criminal, really, and people need to be held accountable for the damage it's caused to several generations of children. Others suggest a connection between the increased n umber of vaccines and the rise in autism diagnoses: [4.26] As all of my kids were growing up I knew of no other kids with autism & that generation only had about 8 vaccines. The current y oung ones are getting more than twice that number & the numbers of autistic kids is skyrocketing. Not only are there more vaccines, but, as much as 4 shots are given during one visit to the doctor. I have questioned many pediatricians & discovered there ha s never been a study done to prove that multiple vaccines given that way is not harmfu l. Again, these kinds of beliefs are often adopted by a spectrum of people, some of whom reject vaccination entirely and some of whom otherwise acc ept its advantages and may even ultimately fully vaccinate their children: [4.27] The problem is that they give them all to fa st to close to each other and they do cocktails on top of them already being dangerous. I made sure they spaced my boys vaccines and I never allowed a cocktail because th at changes the vaccine altogether.. I felt that helped and other moms have started doing this. This idea of delaying vaccines is extremely common and those who engage in it often do not consider it to be anti-vaccination behavior. Many parents believe that in the first few years of life, before their child goes to preschool or kinde rgarten, the risk of infectious disease is low. They therefore adopt what they consider the precaut ionary measure of delaying infant vaccines with the intention that the child be \"caught up\" by the time he or she enrolls in school and socializes regularly with other children (Dannetun, et al., 2005; Saada, et al., 2014). This behavior is enhanced by the fact that most states' vaccination requirements apply to students 84 enrolling in schools. Notably, only certain kinds of families can take this approach, as households without a stay-at-home parent whose chil dren are in daycare would presumably face greater risks from communicable diseases. As we have seen, concerns about the cumulative eff ects of vaccines are most common as a motivation for selective vaccination or for delay ed vaccination. Although full non-vaccinators often list cumulative effects among their concerns, such concerns by themselves seem insufficient to motivate a total rejection of vacci nation. As a result, full non-vaccinators tend to have additional beliefs, including of course belief s about toxicity. Another prevalent set of beliefs that seems to motivate a more comprehensive avoidance of vaccines are beliefs about the very premise of immunization itself. Beliefs about the Premise of Immunization Anti-vaccination beliefs about the premise of immu nization include both beliefs about the vaccines and about the diseases the vaccines seek t o prevent. Some people believe that vaccines are fundamentally ineffective, or are effective onl y for a short time. Interestingly, medical science agrees that vaccines vary in their effectiv eness and longevity, and that none is 100% effective. The anti-vaccine stance toward this is that ineffective vaccines are not worth the risk, while the pro-vaccine stance considers this a reaso n to vaccinate as many people as possible. Another common anti-vaccination belief is that a va ccine can infect patients with the very disease it is intended to prevent, while the pro-va ccination belief is that vaccines confer immunity without infection. Anti-vaccination belie fs about the diseases themselves include that most vaccine preventable diseases are not a serious threat and that the effect of those diseases was already diminishing before the vaccine was intr oduced. This is often associated with a preference for options that are perceived to be mor e natural than vaccination. Pro-vaccination 85 beliefs, of course, tend to emphasize the threat of the diseases and that that threat has diminished because of vaccination. That some of these beliefs are contradictory is again typical of the complex belief profile that describes the informati on environment. A primary area of disagreement about the safety of vaccines centers on their effectiveness. Some people doubt that vaccination s confer immunity at all (O'Shea, 2013). This belief is commonly supported by references to infec tion statistics: [4.28] you need to educate yourself a little more.w hen there are outbreaks most of them include mostly vaccinated kids.duh.they must not wo rk to well. The effectiveness of vaccines is not necessarily a point of significant disagreement, as even the medical establishment acknowledges their limitation s. As explained on the website of the World Health Organization (2015), \"No vaccine is 100% eff ective.... For reasons related to the individual, not all vaccinated persons develop immu nity. Most routine childhood vaccines are effective for 85% to 95% of recipients\" (para. 2). The disagreement arises as to how interpret this f act. The position of the CDC and other medical organizations relies on the concept of herd immunity, which is essentially that the more people who are vaccinated, the less likely it is th at the disease can spread even to the unvaccinated or to those to whom the vaccine has no t conferred immunity. As a consequence of this, those who believe in herd immunity believe th at declining vaccination rates endanger more than just the unvaccinated, a belief which the unva ccinated openly reject: [4.29] If the other kids are vaccinated and the vac cines are so great you don't have to worry about your child getting infected. This just proves your ignorance and that your vaccines are not all they are cracked up to be. [4.30] If the others have had immunizations they sh ouldn't be infected, they should already have immunities built up from VACCINATIONS! So what are you worried about? 86 It is not always easy to distinguish whether such c omments arise from ignorance that vaccines are not perfectly effective, or from a belief that their ineffectiveness is a reason not to get them, in contrast to the principle of herd immunity. Ind eed, some argue that herd immunity is a myth (Blaylock, 2012). The core of this belief is that r egardless of whether or not vaccines confer initial immunity, that immunity declines so rapidly that the majority of the population is effectively unvaccinated: [4.31] The vaccination does not even fully protect from the disease. In fact, most children who get the disease were previously vaccinated. Mo st vaccinations are only good for an average of 7 years. I do not know any adult who ge ts vaxes every 7 years. Most don't ever get vaxed again after childhood. [4.32] as \"unvaccination\" rates continue to rise... t he 'herd immunity' concept will be increasingly less of an argument in support of the public health benefit and expenditure on mass vaccination schemes. According to this belief, if most people are unvacc inated or under-vaccinated, then the decline in communicable diseases cannot be attributable to her d immunity or to immunization. It is worth noting that a belief that vaccines are ineffective is, by itself, probably insufficient reason to decline a vaccine without so me corresponding belief that vaccines are harmful. This is usually the case in the collected data where, in addition to concerns about toxicity and cumulative effects that we have alread y considered, some negative beliefs about vaccines relate to the premise of immunization as w ell. One such anti-vaccination belief is that vaccines can infect people with the very disease they are intended to cure. This is a particularly common belief about flu vaccines, about which people who otherwise fully vaccinate nonetheless ha ve concerns: [4.33] Every year I got the flu shot I ended up sic k as a dog, I haven't gotten the flu shot in 9 years.. I haven't been sick once and I have ch anged nothing in my daily life. 87 While this is most commonly associated with the flu vaccine, these beliefs are by no means exclusive to it: [4.34] It is nuts to say that injecting a known sic kness into an otherwise healthy child is 'good'. [4.35] Its actually people who get these injections that create the more powerful versions [of the diseases] [4.36] It should be the other way around where pare nts of unvaccinated kids should not b comfy letting their kids play wif ur vaccinated kid s b'coz ur kids are carrying the \"weakened form of virus\". Pro-vaccine beliefs, on the other hand distinguish between an immune response to a vaccine and actually getting the disease: [4.37] I get the flu vaccine every year. Every year , I get a bit sick for a day or two after taking it \u2014 fatigue, headache, general don't-want-t o-get-out-of-bed-itis. It's been explained to me by a nurse that what's happening is a general sort of immune response to having something shot into me \u2014 not the flu itself. So it can happen that the vaccine will make you \"sick\" \u2014 just sick in the sense that you d on't feel great, not in the sense that you're actually infected with something that will k ill you, or that can be passed along to another victim. While these beliefs are similar to beliefs about to xicity in that they concern what is injected into the body, there is an important distinction. Belie fs about toxicity tend to concern the effects of substances added to the vaccines for various reason s. Beliefs such as those articulated in quotations 4.33 through 4.37 specifically concern t he injection of the virus itself. That is, of course, the central concept underlying immunization . There is also a general anti-vaccination belief th at the diseases vaccinated for are not a threat. Sometimes, this is the belief that the cha nces of getting the diseases are so low that vaccination is unnecessary: [4.38] very very very minimal chance of getting pol io without the shot 88 Other times, it is the claim that even if one gets the disease, it is not dangerous: [4.39] I was born in 1944. It was considered a nor mal part of childhood to contract measles, mumps, and chicken pox. They were not con sidered dangerous diseases. I never knew or heard personally of anyone who died o f these diseases. [4.40] ha ha ha! measles, mumps had them both. it was great. I got 3 weeks off school both times and got to go bowling with mom instead o f school. Don't remember how sick I was. just being treated special and going bowlin g and no school! Bring it on! It was way better than getting Autism that's for sure! As implied in this last quotation, many anti-vaccin ation beliefs view the premise of immunization as a choice between a mild disease tha t is very unlikely and a more serious, more likely harm from the vaccine: [4.41] One person out of a thousand died from an ou tbreak of measles? Those odds are a lot better than putting every kid at risk for autis m [4.42] You are absolutely right. They are natural childhood diseases, there is nothing temporary or natural from Autism. We shall explore the risk-benefit analysis at the h eart of such beliefs in the next chapter. Related pro-vaccination beliefs, unsurprisingly, tend to em phasize the threat of the diseases and the fact that vaccination is the reason for their diminished impact on modern society: [4.43] You know what's devastating? Measles, mumps , or rubella. Do some research about some of these horrible disaeses. [4.44] I grew up in the fiftys too. I also contract ed all of the childhood diseases, measels, mumps, chickenpox etc. Something else happened to m e in the fiftys. My father contracted Polio during the epidemic in the early 1 950s and he DIED from it. He was a healthy, strapping, six foot tall 26 year old. He s irvived in a iron lung for 1 year before dying. Another anti-vaccination belief that is perhaps mo re extreme but nonetheless rather common combines the belief that vaccines are ineffe ctive with the belief that the diseases are 89 non-threatening by claiming that data shows the dis eases diminishing before the introduction of vaccinations for them: [4.45] FACT, diseases have ALWAYS ebbed and flowed before vaccines and continue to do so. [4.46] Measles like all other childhood diseases wa s cleaned up 90% before the vaccines were being used... Clean water and good nutrition and sanitation, dropped childhood diseases by 90% This claim is often supported on the Internet by gr aphs showing the steady decline of disease death rates over the course of the 20 th century. The pro-vaccination criticism of that da ta is that it uses the wrong metric, as explained in the quota tion below: [4.47] That image shows death rates, not infection rates. Talk about cherry picking data. Immunizations aim to prevent infection, not cure th ose already infected. ... Mind you I have an open mind in regard to vaccinations not lea ding to the eradication of particular diseases. However, you would have to show prevalenc e of infection of said diseases over time, not death rates. In the data collected for this study, there is rare ly any anti-vaccination response to the distinction between incidence rates and death rates as a measur e of vaccine effectiveness, but such opposition does exist, as in the following comment which seems to encapsulate the entire argument that immunization is not responsible for t he declining threat of disease: [4.48] This chart is one among 4 or 5 that all show disease decline long before vaccines were introduced. Yes it shows the death rate but if death rates decline it would follow that less people also were getting sick. Not only that b ut isn't one of the main reasons for taking vaccines is to prevent death from disease. I f you can weather an infection and live your immunity will be the better for it. Vaccine im munity is weak an ineffective and why they want you to get boosters... The decline of disea se across all parts of the world was due to better sanitation, the understanding of how disease is spread, and better nutrition. We no longer throw waste in the streets. People bat he and wash their hands regularly. We don't live virtually on top of each other. We eat a reasonably balanced diet with a basic understanding of nutrition and vitamins. This has c aused the decline in all diseases including the ones that we have no vaccines for. 90 This comment also articulates a belief that is comm only associated with the belief that vaccines did not cause the decline in infectious disease. S pecifically, it suggests that certain lifestyle choices have more effect on health than vaccination s do. [4.49] I do not get the flu shot for my kids or mys elf. Considering that we are all healthy, live healthy, eat healthy individuals with no under lying conditions.... I don't see the need. Other commenters take this emphasis on lifestyle ch oices even further: [4.50] If you keep your child healthy from the star t you won't HAVE TO WORRY about anything! Birth naturally, to prevent birth injuri es and complications, keep your baby with you, breastfeed her, co-sleep to keep her safe and warm and reduces sids and makes breastfeeding easier, keep her free from vaccines, breastfeed her exclusively as long as possibly for the first year, let her eat foods when she is ready to do so herself, keep breastfeeding her, use breastmilk as medicine ... any illness keep breastfeeding, .... Your baby will be quite safe and healthy compared to mos t babies. This exaltation of the natural is frequently associ ated with anti-vaccination beliefs. Even though this quotation seems to digress from anti-vaccinati on beliefs, these digressions are common elsewhere in the analyzed data, which is rife with examples anti-vaccination beliefs coinciding with natural lifestyles and alternative medicine pr actices. This often extends to a demonizing of the supposedly unnatural processes involved in vacc ination, including its chemical components and the process of introducing something into the b ody artificially. Many even allege that the body's own immune system is superior to vaccination , which they perceive to disrupt the immune system rather than empower it: [4.51] We don't need to be 'protected' from them AL L. Our natural immunity does its job quite well. It doesn't need to be exposed to d iseases from other continents in order to maintain health. [4.52] The power that made the body, heals the body ; and I think we as a society are a little conceided by thinking that even with all the latest breakthroughs we're better able to fix/fight something we barely understand. Nature is wiser than us! 91 Pro-vaccination beliefs, however, emphasize that wh ile vaccines are manmade, this does not make them dangerous or even unnatural: [4.53] The argument is an odd one in that vaccines induce an immune response, so that it's the body's own \"natural\" immunity which is the n primed to identify and fight any future pathogen exposure. For many, this preference for natural immunity amou nts to the overall impression that unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated ones: [4.54] I was not vaccinated as a child... I always seemed healthier than my vaccinated peers, who were sick many times each year. I rarely became ill, and when I did get sick, I healed quickly, always without allopathic medicine. ... Today, I am a well-educated, healthy adult, [4.55] The Un-vaccinated children such as my 5 gran dchildren are healthy active and well balanced children. The vaccinated children are continually sick with runny noses, watery eyes, coughing, with fever and flu symptoms. Occurring over and over. When my grandchildren do get sick, it is a very mild case. They get over it quickly, their immune system is exercised and strengthened In summary, beliefs about the premise of immunizat ion relate both to vaccines themselves and to vaccine preventable diseases. Pe ople dispute the effectiveness of vaccines, both their initial ability to confer immunity and t he duration the immunity lasts. Some also believe that the core principle of immunization - t he injection of a dead or weakened virus in order to arouse the body's immune system - can resu lt in the body actually being infected with the disease. Other beliefs relating to the disease s themselves include that the diseases are difficult to catch or are not harmful even if contr acted. Such beliefs sometimes extend to denying that immunization is responsible for the di minished threat of the disease, attributing it instead to healthier lifestyles and natural health practices. All of these beliefs have in common some skepticism about the core principle of vaccina tion - that vaccines confer immunity and that immunity is necessary. While concerns about toxici ty and cumulative effects are often discrete 92 problems that could at least potentially be correct ed, these beliefs about the premise of immunization are part of a more profound disbelief in and disillusionment with the vaccine program, and often with the healthcare system in ge neral. Beliefs about Compromised Integrity Such disillusionment with the healthcare system is an extremely common, and probably fundamental, belief about vaccine safety. There ar e many concerns about the integrity and reliability of the system that determines whether v accines are safe. To varying degrees, such beliefs seem to underlie all other beliefs about va ccine safety, for in order to believe vaccines are safe, one must believe in the fundamental integrity of the system that declares their safety, a system that includes scientific research, medical p rofessionals, government health organizations, and pharmaceutical companies. To doubt vaccine saf ety, one must doubt the overall integrity of such a system. Consistent with the \"buffet\" of var iations and gradations of vaccine safety beliefs, the degree of one's vaccine safety beliefs seems to relate to the degree of one's belief in the system that evaluates vaccine safety. Those wh o accept vaccine safety tend to express belief in science, the advice of their own doctors, and th e recommendations of agencies like the CDC, but they can nonetheless have criticisms of certain aspects of the system, while still believing that it functions correctly overall. Those who rej ect vaccines altogether may reject every facet of that system at every level, or may express faith in some components of the system while distrusting others, such as expressing belief in th eir own doctor but not the medical establishment, or a belief in science while rejecti ng the way science is practiced or the influence of external factors upon it. In particular, anti-v accination beliefs tend to emphasize the corrupting influence of profit motives. The degree to which such motives corrupt, and what aspects of the system they corrupt in particular, v aries among different believers. 93 The core belief about integrity has to do with the influence of money on the system of vaccine production and safety evaluation. Essentia lly, this is the belief that the first priority of the vaccine program is to make profits, and that al l other priorities, including the safety and health of children, are compromised or discarded in service of the profit motive: [4.56] LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH in this country is do ctors and pharmaceuticals. What a huge cover up. I don't trust the medical in dustry they are all about the $$$$$. While the heart of such claims is financial conflic ts of interest, there are subtle variations in how those conflicts are believed to be manifest. One b elief is that the scientific research cannot be trusted because it is mostly sponsored or conducted by pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines: [4.57] Are we supposed to believe that the current medical paradigm is a beacon of objectivity? The fact is that vaccine manufacturer s are not nonpartisan and neither is the science behind vaccines apolitical. [4.58] The FDA actually allows the vaccine makers t o do their own safety studies; they merely accept the results. Hundreds of individuals at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have conflict waivers because of their t ies to the vaccine industry. The second half of this latter comment suggests ano ther variation on the conflict of interest theme, which is that the corruption is not limited to the research, but includes the entities supporting vaccines, such as the FDA, CDC, and AAP. [4.59] vaccine manufacturers... will put pressure on the FDA to say that they are safe and the CDC to recommend them to the schedule. Pro-vaccination beliefs view the economics differen tly, emphasizing the high cost of production as evidence that profits are not the controlling mo tivation behind vaccination: [4.60] Yes, maybe you should follow the $$$$ and re alize that vaccines produces large income and virtually no profit. These same pharmace utical companies make the drugs and disposables used in treating infected people in hospitals and the standard profit ratio between treating one infected person and vaccinatin g one person is over 150,000 to one. 94 If you bothered to follow the money you would see t hat pharma companies do not want to sell vaccines and this has always been the case - most of them quit producing them in the '90s because there was so little profit in it. More profit is made on generic aspirin than DTaP and MMRII combined. Please, before you start s hooting your mouths off please figure out the difference between revenue and profi t. [4.61] Even following your model of \"money first\", this is not a winning business strategy... there are many, MANY drug candidates that fail in Phase I and II clinical trials ... which is one of the reasons it costs so mu ch. If hiding data is so prevalent (or standard practice for the industry), you'd expect a lot more drugs to pass - especially if having it fail can bankrupt the company. Yet even w ith these stakes, we see failures year after year, and countless companies bankrupted as a result. Another variation of the compromised integrity the me is that vaccines are the subject of a cover-up. This is the belief that vaccine manufact urers, health agencies, and the medical community are aware of the safety problems with vac cines, but they would lose money if they admitted them: [4.62] look who stands to financially suffer (oh, t hey'll NEVER admit this) if these programs for vaccinations are reexamined and curtai led. Even hint at a threat to an industry's paycheck and they will not stop pummelin g you. [4.63] These scientists [stay] blindfolded, as the y sing Lalala with their fingers in their ears, their checks for pharma funding sticking out of their pockets. Some extend the reach of this alleged cover-up beyo nd vaccine manufacturers and the medical community to implicate larger aspects of the inform ation and media environment: [4.64] Accurate data is not released through regula r media outlets. Such allegations are often compared to other scient ific controversies, such as the unknown dangers of Thalidomide, or, particularly, the paral lels between vaccine safety and tobacco safety: [4.65] this is a biiger coverup then cigerates im p issed... the courts wont award anything the doctors cover it up too since they the ones act ually giving the vaccines... 95 Pro-vaccination beliefs, on the other hand, seem to find the scale of such alleged conspiracies to be evidence against them: [4.66] It is far more likely that a doctor or resea rcher that is looking for a little fame is not accurate then multiple agencies and the medical com munity are getting together to cover up evidence that vaccines can harm children. There is, however, one extreme anti-vaccination bel ief that goes so far as to suggest not only that vaccine safety is exaggerated, but that dangers and the cover-up are intentional attempts at population control: [4.67] Vaccines are bioweapons. [4.68] VACCINES WERE CREATED TO DECREASE THE HUMAN POPULATION, & ITS WORKING. THE GOVERNMENT IS JUST STEPS CLOSER TO THEIR NEW WORLD ORDER... LOOK IT UP!! Although such beliefs are extreme and uncommon, the y are prevalent enough in the data to warrant identifying here. It is possible that beli efs of this extreme are articulated on the Internet disproportionately to their prevalence in the popul ation. Often, beliefs about compromised integrity are so strong as to imply that only those who are compromised would defend vaccination: [4.69] why would you be defending these vaccines, a re you part of the Bill Gates foundation or something? There is no legitimate re ason to defend these criminals or their products of destruction and death unless you are ei ther brainless or getting paid, and I checked your [YouTube] channel, you don't seem brai nless. [4.70] It sounds to me like you... are either a kickb ack taking doctor, a pharmaceutical representative, or one of the \"herds\" that has been brainwashed into believing all doctors are gods. Get a grip or get a brain. Through the strength of the beliefs articulated her e, compromised integrity emerges as the only explanation for beliefs in vaccine safety, implying that all other reasons, such as the consensus of medical research, are invalid or simply do not exis t. This highlights the common theme running 96 through all beliefs about compromised integrity tha t the priorities of the vaccination program are misplaced. In particular, this implies that despit e the declared primary intentions of the program, the health and safety of children are not its first priority. It is important not to understate the importance o f beliefs about compromised integrity as a motivation for anti-vaccination beliefs. It is d ifficult to find examples in the collected data of other anti-vaccination beliefs that are not stated concurrently with beliefs about compromised integrity. Indeed, even when such beliefs are not overtly stated, they are implicit in other beliefs which would seem to require an underlying distrust of the integrity of the health system. For example, beliefs about toxicity seem to require a b elief that the medical community either is not aware of the toxicity of the vaccines, or is not co ncerned about it. The same is likely true of beliefs about the cumulative effect of vaccines, si nce to believe that vaccines are cumulatively harmful one must believe either that the medical co mmunity does not know or does not care. The former belief, that the medical community is no t aware of the safety problems, would seem to require a dim view of the capabilities of the me dical community. The latter belief, that the medical community is not concerned, seems to depend on one of two underlying explanations for the lack of concern. One underlying belief, that t he medical community is not concerned because there is no reason to be concerned, would s eem to motivate pro-vaccination beliefs. The opposite concern, that the medical community is not concerned even though there is a reason to be concerned, amounts to a belief in compromised in tegrity and would seem to motivate anti- vaccination beliefs. In a slightly different way, such beliefs seem to underlie anti-vaccination beliefs about the premise of immunization, since to allow for flaws in the premise one must believe either that the medical community does not sufficiently understand vaccination, or that it does understand vaccination but is not concerned ab out the flaws in the premise. Therefore, 97 while it may be an exaggeration to say that beliefs about compromised integrity underlie all anti- vaccination beliefs, it certainly seems as though a n essential ingredient of anti-vaccination belief is the underlying belief that the medical community is incompetent or malevolent. Beliefs about Civil Society For many, this lack of faith in the healthcare sys tem extends to a lack of faith in larger social institutions, including the government itsel f. Sometimes this is the political view that the government is corrupt or incompetent, but often it is a view about the responsibilities of people and institutions within societies. Rather than con sidering such beliefs in isolation, we might consider them a subset of beliefs about compromised integrity, because unlike other beliefs which are often combined but can easily be distinct , complaints about civil society seem to depend on some degree of distrust in the authoritie s the complaints are against. In other words, they depend on some degree of distrust in the respe ctive institutions. Probably as a consequence of the prevalent beliefs about conflicts of interest, a thread that runs through anti-vaccination beliefs is the v iew that individual concerns, particularly the concerns of parents, are insufficiently addressed. Many people with anti-vaccination beliefs feel that their concerns are not being taken seriously, but that they are instead being told what to do: [4.71] One doctor told my sister he wouldn't see he r son anymore if she opted not to get the vaccine. How dare he refuse her the right as a mother to not vaccinate the way he wants her to . [emphasis added] [4.72] Trust us. We are hear to help. And pressure and force you to do with your kids, what we want. Yep, bad parents. Worried about their kids. ... then they were told, just get the shot and trust us. Think about it. [emphasis ad ded] Note the use in both quotations of phrases about wh at the doctor wants, which emphasize the dominance of the doctor's desires over those of the parent. This conflict is at the heart of concerns about vaccination programs. Given anti-va ccination concerns about toxicity, 98 vaccination schedules and compromised intentions, i t is not surprising that many patients and parents are simply not comfortable letting someone else make healthcare decisions for them: [4.73] We as parents should have the right to deter mine what is best for our children. This is a violation of our rights. Such invocations of rights are common. Underlying many anti-vaccination beliefs is a general concern for civil liberties and individual choice. A principal focus of this concern is what many consider to be forced vaccination. One o f the solutions proposed by those who fear declining vaccination rates is state-mandated vacci ne compliance for children enrolled in school. Indeed, many states have such mandates, although al l also allow various exemptions to them. Parents with anti-vaccination beliefs, however, vie w these mandates as a violation of their civil liberties. The two views of this issue are encapsu lated in the following exchange from the comments on an article about vaccine safety, in whi ch five different speakers replying to each other articulate opposing sides of the argument: [4.74] Vaccinate your own child and let each parent decide . If your child is vaccinated, you have nothing to worry about. I don't know if yo u have kids but I feel that each parent has the right to decide what is best for their own child. You and the government need to mind your own business. [4.75] [addressing 4.74] There are two problems here: 1) S ociety has to step in sometime, unless you believe parents should have the right to beat, torture and murder their children. If you believe society must step in, then we have t he issue of irrational parents putting their children at risk of disease... And 2) your irra tional beliefs are putting other people at risk of catching disease. [4.76] [addressing 4.75] You have to be joking, right? It is a parent's responsibility to take care of their children how they see fit....Lan d of the free ring any bells? Parents get to decide what their child will eat, wear and what healthcare they will get. We aren't talking about torturing children!! Society has to s tep in sometime!?! INSANE.There are plenty of communist societies/Countries for you to exist in....please move to one 99 [4.77] [addressing 4.76] Not when the way they are treatin g their children is tantamount to child abuse. If you don't believe in vaccinating your children against deadly diseases, you should have to move to the middle of nowhere wh ere your little plaguebearer can't hurt anyone else. [4.78] [addressing 4.74] And what of the people who haven' t had the vaccination? What of landed immigrants who were unable to get their v accinations in their home third world country? What of older people, who have never been given the opportunity to get these shots...? It's a civic responsibility to make sure t hat people like you do as little damage as your misled quackery bullcrap can. Both sides of the quoted conversation speak in term s of the responsibilities of a society regarding vaccination. Anti-vaccination views emphasize civi l liberties, while pro-vaccination views emphasize civic duty. Anti-vaccination views emph asize individual choice, while pro- vaccination views emphasize an individual's obligat ion to others. In some sense then, an important undercurrent of many beliefs about vaccin ation may relate to beliefs about responsibility in a civil society. Anti-vaccinatio n belief often suggests a reverence for individual responsibility to oneself, with emphasis on the nee d to do one's own research and the right to make one's own healthcare decisions. Pro-vaccinatio n belief suggests a reverence for individual responsibility to others, with an emphasis on parti cipation in vaccination for the greater good. Both sides of the debate, interestingly, seem to re vere in different ways the responsibility of institutions to individuals, focusing on the intent ions and priorities of healthcare institutions, or the responsibility of governments to protect our he alth and to ensure our freedom. A Buffet of Beliefs The quotations throughout this chapter have been i solated from their context in order to illustrate specific issues, but taken in their full context, and in the larger context of all articula ted beliefs, they paint a much more nuanced picture tha n a \"movement\" of parents who reject vaccines for their children. Common explanations f or anti-vaccination beliefs are that the 100 believers are ignorant, stupid or crazy. While we certainly find examples of each of those things in the data and elsewhere, we also find examples of ordinary parents to whom none of those descriptions would apply. If theorizing about misi nformation on the Internet is correct (Floridi, 1996; Katz, 1998) we should not be surprised to fin d a group of parents, primarily concerned about the safety of their children, confronted by a n information environment in which contradictory information is exceedingly easy to fi nd. The ignorance that is often assumed to underlie anti-vaccination beliefs is certainly pres ent, but not always, and can sometimes be explained by a lack of time or ability to fully res earch a topic, given the volume of material available. That same ignorance, and the presumed s tupidity, is sometimes refuted by the depth of knowledge evident even among those holding anti- vaccination beliefs. Likewise, while many anti-vaccination beliefs may rise to a level of par anoia that most people cannot muster, few show evidence of pathological breaks with reality, and a s we shall explore further in the next chapter, many people ground their beliefs in values, factua l claims and personal experiences that are anything but delusional. This does not, of course, imply the equivalency of any particular beliefs, nor is it intended to condone them. Rather, it emphasizes the multitu de of different kinds of people that can draw upon the same basic set of beliefs in a multitude o f different ways. In particular, it suggests that the existence of an \"anti-vaccination\" movement is complicated by various concerns of various strengths in various combinations. At the same tim e, the variations appear neither infinite nor disorderly, as they overwhelmingly draw on the few categories of belief we have explored in this chapter - about toxicity, cumulative effects, the p remise of immunization, compromised integrity and civil liberties. Hence we describe the formati on of vaccine safety beliefs using a buffet 101 metaphor. From a limited set of beliefs, each indi vidual believer selects his or her own combination. Some people seem to choose vaccines themselves on an item-by-item basis: [4.79] The simple fact is that since the advent of vaccinations, the incidence of deadly and debilitating diseases has plummeted. But there are without a doubt risks. And there are vaccinations that are nearly pointless in my op inion...for instance chicken pox. Understand what you *should* and should *not* vacci nate against, and always read opposing sources of information to have a better sh ot at a realistic view. This comment begins with the overt articulation of a pro-vaccination position, an embrace in fact of its core premise. The commenter then states a softly anti-vaccination position, that vaccines have risks, which is nonetheless consistent with th e formal position of the medical community. The comment then elaborates the anti-vaccination be lief by distinguishing some shots as \"nearly pointless\" and implying that there are some disease s worth the risk, and others that are not. It is difficult to describe this commenter's overall posi tion as either pro-vaccination or anti- vaccination. It is certainly inconsistent with the official recommendations of the CDC, while at the same time supporting vaccination in general ter ms. This shot-by-shot evaluation of vaccine safety is quite prevalent in the data, and applies to various vaccines for various reasons. [4.80] Ok. I'm cool with you not getting the Flu va ccination. I always believed that one was kind of BS anyway. But you should ABSOLUTELY be given a hard time with your children going to school without important vaccinat ions. I would not want mine or my friends' children going to school with kids who are unvaccinated just because a doctor who is clearly a quack and Jenny McCarthy told them vaccinations are the devil. Other than the first two sentences, this comment is a strong endorsement of vaccination and an attack on anti-vaccination beliefs, their proponent s, and the parents of unvaccinated children. At the same time, it is not a wholehearted embrace of the vaccination program nor of the premise of vaccination, given that it begins with a rejection of the flu vaccine. The rejection is also stronger 102 than a mere suggestion that it is unnecessary, but adopts at least the rhetorical strength of calling that vaccine \"BS\" (though we must not presume that this necessarily corresponds to a belief that the flu vaccine is a deception, despite the definit ion of \"BS.\") Note the level of knowledge and sophistication of understanding necessary for evaluations such as these. In order to hold such a belief, one must make distinctions between one vaccine and another. One must understand, at l east to some extent, the individual characteristics of the particular vaccine and the d isease associated with it, and the difference between the characteristics of each vaccine. Those concerned about mercury may be concerned about the flu shot, which contains it, but not abou t the MMR, which does not. Others concerned about cumulative effects might reject the MMR, whil e requesting an individual polio vaccine. Those concerned about the severity of diseases may vaccinate against measles but not chicken pox. This is a more sophisticated profile both of belief and of vaccine uptake than merely vaccinated and unvaccinated children. Just as some people reject one vaccine without rej ecting the entire vaccination program, so there are examples of people who reject a partic ular anti-vaccination belief while embracing other anti-vaccination beliefs. Take for example t he following comment that rejects the connection between vaccines and autism while mainta ining other fundamentally anti-vaccination views: [4.81] I can tell you horror stories about vaccines all day long. What I'm saying is there's no connection between autism and vaccines. Are vacc ine standards subpar? Yes. Do you risk getting the very infection you're trying to be immunized against with vaccines? You bet. Will you get Autism? No. For this commenter, the rejection of autism as a co ncern does not alleviate the belief in \"horror stories\" or that the vaccine can cause the disease it seeks to prevent. Belief profiles like this one may have interesting implications for those seeking ways to counter anti-vaccination beliefs, as it 103 suggests that convincing a person about one issue d oes not amount to full support for vaccinations. An education campaign that debunks t he connection between vaccines and autism, even if it is successful, would appear not to be ef fective in getting believers like this one to accept vaccination as a whole. Merely assembling a list of beliefs does not give a full picture of the subtle configuration of beliefs, as different people draw different conc lusions even from the same beliefs. The following two quotations are examples, like the quo tation above, of someone rejecting one anti- vaccination belief while embracing another. Yet si milar initial premises lead to essentially opposite positions: [4.82] Thermisol is NOT THE CONCERN with vaccines. It used to be, but you get less thermisol in a vaccine than you do eating a couple of bites of salmon. Aluminum, however, is a major concern. Aluminum toxicity is k nown to cause autistic symptoms in healthy adults - that's what aluminum poisoning is [4.83] There is more and more research out there, t hat it is not JUST the thermisol, it is the ALUMINUM contents in these shots that is danger ous. ... Vaccines in and of themselves and not detrimental to childs neurologic al health, it is the AMOUNT of vaccines at the YOUNG ages that are the real proble m. With al the vaccines we currently give at 2 mths, the alluminum levels are hightened to a highly toxic level in that small amount of blood. ... I am a complete supporter of va ccines, one at a time, and/or at a later age. Vaccinate ALL you want, just do it smart Both comments illustrate a rejection of one concern about vaccines (mercury) in favor of a different concern (aluminum), yet one appears to be essentially anti-vaccination and the other essentially pro-vaccination. Interestingly, the re ference to salmon in the first comment (4.82) is a variation on a commonly used pro-vaccination exam ple (as in quote 4.4), that there is more mercury in a single serving of fish than in a vacci ne. Commenter 4.82 appears to be persuaded by the evidence that mercury is not a concern. At the same time, this does not amount to complete support of vaccines, as the alleged simila rity between symptoms of heavy metal poisoning and autism are a commonly used anti-vacci nation example. In the second comment 104 (4.83), we again see a rejection of mercury as a co ncern and an emphasis on aluminum, but note the layers of beliefs articulated here. This perso n appears to accept the premise of immunization, since he or she believes \"vaccines in and of themse lves and [ sic ] not detrimental,\" but does have concerns about both the toxicity of vaccines and th eir cumulative effects, since it is \"the amount of vaccines at the young ages that are the real pro blem.\" In fact, here we see a combination of two anti-vaccination beliefs, that toxicity is the reason for negative cumulative effects. Nonetheless, this commenter insists he or she is a \"complete supporter of vaccines\" despite caveats that are inconsistent with the official pos ition of the medical community. As we have noted, it is common for anti-vaccination beliefs ab out cumulative effects to be associated with an overall acceptance of vaccines, and many parents wi th such beliefs fully vaccinate their children on a modified schedule. It is again difficult to k now whether to consider such parents pro- vaccination or anti-vaccination. Even when the general inclination of the beliefs i s more clearly pro-vaccination or anti- vaccination, the belief profile may still be a mix of pro-vaccination and anti-vaccination beliefs. To define the anti-vaccination movement as the pres ence of anti-vaccination beliefs would overlook a number of people who appear to hold fund amentally pro-vaccination positions despite subscribing to certain anti-vaccination beliefs. F or example, the following comment appears to have been posted to defend vaccine safety, and is i n response to an anti-vaccination comment: [4.84] lets see, polio, small pox, etc. stop being intellectually dishonest, and saying vaccines are all bad because they are not, especial ly when they dont have the preservatives and pumping all these vaccines into b abies when they are younger. Despite its pro-vaccination beginning, this comment qualifies the pro-vaccination belief with concerns about toxicity and cumulative effects, aga in underlining the difficulty of the binary distinction between pro- and anti- that often chara cterize the issue. 105 Taken as a whole, these comments and others like t hem in the data begin to suggest a relationship between certain categories of anti-vac cination belief and certain vaccine uptake behavior. While this study has not measured the st rength of such correlations, it does present compelling evidence for further research into it. Denials of the premise of immunization seem to motivate the least uptake, which seems logical sinc e such beliefs are by definition fundamental. Concerns about cumulative effects seem to motivate the adoption of alternative schedules, ultimately resulting in full vaccine uptake. Belie fs about toxicity and compromised integrity appear to be more complicated, motivating diverse v accine uptake. Some people consider toxicity a reason to forego v accination entirely, as we have already seen in quote 4.1 above: [4.1] ...We are pumping these poisons into our children in t he name of health? ... It is unconscionable to require parents to pump these tox ic cocktails into their children, beginning at birth. Others lament toxicity as the one concern about an otherwise worthwhile program: [4.85] my best information still says that vaccinat ion is the best method to prevent catastrophic disease! We have no real choice here. I do wish that the companies would find other chemicals to go with the vaccine so as t o end all this controversy. Again, even beliefs that vaccines are toxic do not necessarily amount to ultimately being anti- vaccination. They may result in a complete rejecti on of vaccines, a call for reform, or a shot-by- shot evaluation based on individual ingredients. Compromised integrity is also not necessarily a fu lly anti-vaccination belief. Many people have negative or suspicious opinions of phar maceutical companies. This does not necessarily necessitate anti-vaccination views. Fo r example, a woman posts this comment on a news article: [4.86a] you cant go by the [National Health Service in the U.K.], they are always doing stupid shite, they aren 't in the business of healing, they are money hordin g murderers. 106 The same women then posts, only a few minutes later , this comment: [4.86b] maybe you should look at how many children died before these vaccines came out. I work in nursing, you know how many old woma n I have met who buried their baby cause they go one of these diseases and died. In between the comments, this woman relates a story about her husband 's medical care that has clearly left her with a negative view of the Nation al Health Service in general, yet she is herself a healthcare professional and apparent supporter of v accination. There are many such examples. For those intereste d in increasing vaccination rates, a more sophisticated understanding of the buffet of v accine safety beliefs may be instructive. At the same time, we must not overstate the diversi ty of beliefs about vaccines, since there is an organized movement with spokespeople and messaging that draws on all or most of the tropes we have identified. To the extent that there may b e consistency among those advocates, however, it is consistency in information productio n. At the level of the individual believers, at least to the extent they express themselves on the Internet, the belief profile is subtler and more varied. Some certainly parrot the doctrine of the more formally organized elements of the movement and cite as their evidence some of the mor e organized information sources, but others make their way belief-by-belief through a contradic tory and emotional array of selections, underscoring the individuality that is so often cit ed as characteristic of Web 2.0 (Witteman & Zikmund-Fisher, 2012). Of course, this is an argument against generalizin g, but even more than that it may say something fundamental about the complexity of belie f profiles, perhaps even about how humans believe. While beliefs are often held in congruent systems, such as religions or political affiliations, it also seems likely that vaccine saf ety is not the only environment where beliefs are assembled using a buffet system. The Internet may even enhance such ways of knowing, 107 providing as it does a diversity of highly-accessib le information (Floridi, 1996), in contrast to packaged belief systems propagated in narrower medi a environments such as those of churches and political parties (see Quandt, 2012). This may also suggest something fundamental about misinformation on the Internet. Despite theories that the Internet 's ease of production will flood the market with poo r quality information, the information produced in the anti-v accine environment is narrow, providing the limited buffet of choices. Still each individual b eliever consumes that buffet in his or her own way, underscoring that misinformation happens at th e level of the believer. A small number of dishes can make a large number of unique meals. Th ere is, in other words, more diversity in the consumption of this particular information than in its production. While it is far from demonstrative proof of such a thesis, the data coll ected for this study is certainly consistent with a view that misinformation is less a measure of wha t is produced than of how it is believed. 108 CHAPTER FIVE HOW PEOPLE JUSTIFY THEIR BELIEFS ABOUT VACCINE SAFETY In the interviews conducted for this study, all of the parents spoke of using the Internet to research vaccine safety. However, while it was oft en the first source they would consult, none of them seemed to use the Internet exclusively, but ra ther as part of a diversity of sources including books, news articles, their doctor, peers, and the observations of their own personal experience. Since the Internet itself is a complex collection o f different sources, it is difficult to distinguish between online and offline evidence evaluation, suc h as whether someone's having read an article in the news meant reading it in a newspaper or on the Internet and indeed whether that distinction would matter. Given the small number of interviews here and the complexity of the media environment, we cannot draw firm conclusions about how people might use the Internet to form beliefs about vaccine safety. However, by stu dying the comments and other material that Internet users post, both to express their beliefs and to defend them, we might observe how people justify their beliefs. Given the classic de finition of knowledge as \"justified true belief\" (Fallis, 2006; Furner, 2010), from this negotiation of belief justification way may at least make some inferences about how people evaluate evidence to acquire knowledge. In the back-and-forth of comments sections, belief s are often explicitly stated, as when commenters walk through the steps of their reasonin g process, relay a personal experience that has convinced them, or cite some source or authorit y from which their belief derives. Other times, it is more implicit, as when an articulated belief relies upon assumptions that suggest the underlying evidence. Just as with the patterns of beliefs themselves, certain means of justification recur throughout the data, suggesting the widespread applicability of a small number of evaluation tactics. 109 Four primary categories were identified in the dat a as examples of how people believe: risk-benefit calculations, reason, personal experie nce, and authority. Like the complex buffet of beliefs themselves, the means by which people justi fy vaccine safety beliefs are not always distinct or exclusive. Rather they interrelate in complex ways. At the core of all such evaluations is a comparison of risks and benefits. This seems to be the fundamental consideration about vaccine safety. In turn, the risks and benefits in each situation are determined either by reasoning through evidence, by comparing evidence to personal experience, or by relying upon some authority. In turn, person al experience, particularly emotional experience, exerts considerable influence upon both reason and authority. Each evaluator might use one or more of these techniques in various comb inations and to varying degrees, and the categories are not always distinct, as evaluators o ften use one category as a measure for the other, such as using reason or personal experience as criteria for evaluating authority. Nonetheless, it is instructive to tease apart these various criteria and their relationships to each other, as well as the ways in which the Internet ma y enhance and further complicate them. Risk/Benefit To understand how people evaluate vaccine safety w e must first understand the fundamental evaluation that underlies every other t actic of evaluation\u2014a calculation of risk and benefit. While the negotiation is often implicit, i t is nonetheless so fundamental that it is difficul t to find examples of vaccine safety evaluations that are not based on risk-benefit comparisons even if they are not overtly articulated. An evalu ation of vaccine safety is an evaluation of the benefits of a vaccine compared to its risks, which in turn amounts to an evaluation of the risks of a vaccine-preventable disease compared to the risks of a vaccine. At the same time, a rich series of sub-calculations underlies this most basic balan cing of options. 110 Those who determine that the risk of the disease i s greater than the risk of the vaccine will of course tend to have pro-vaccination beliefs , such as in the following comment: [5.1] Every child I will ever have will be vaccinat ed, even if there is a possibility of autism, even if it's strong, because I could never consider the chance of autism as more important than the life of my child. Likewise, those viewing the risk of the vaccine as greater than the risk of the disease would tend to hold anti-vaccination beliefs, as in this exampl e from Chapter 4: [4.41] One person out of a thousand died from an o utbreak of measles? Those odds are a lot better than putting every kid at risk for autis m. Where in Chapter 4 we understood this quotation to demonstrate skepticism about the premise of vaccination, and particularly a belief that the dis ease is not serious, we can note the risk-benefit calculation at its heart. Notably, regardless of w hich side of the safety debate a particular person ultimately finds compelling, the same negotiations support the belief. Of course, the calculation is often more complicat ed than this most basic consideration of which risk is greater. As one example, those doubt ful of the premise of vaccines may view the vaccine as ineffective, emphasizing not the risk of the vaccine so much as its lack of benefit. As another example, those with concerns about the cumu lative effects of vaccines compare risks at various times, not merely pure risk per se. Likewis e, as discussed in Chapter 4, the risks of different diseases are often weighed differently, a nd the risks of some vaccines are considered to be higher than others. Although the outcome of ris k-benefit comparisons is ultimately binary\u2014 either they get the vaccine or not\u2014the comparisons themselves are subtle, contextual, and highly individualized. Some scholars have noted that risk-benefit calcula tions are different for vaccine safety than for many similar situations. To begin with, t he calculation is different when one side is preventative rather than curative, because it invol ves intervention with a healthy person (Betsch, 111 2011). Hence, a healthy patient might view the sid e effects of vaccination as less desirable than a cancer patient might view the side effects of che motherapy. Similarly, the options are between a presence and an absence, i.e. between the presenc e of a shot on one side and the absence of a disease on the other. Given this, vaccine hesitanc y is, as Serpell and Green (2006) note, \"understandable in terms of a tendency to favour ac ts of omission over acts of commission where risks are involved\" (p. 4044). In other words, the present option can seem more threatening than the absent option: [4.33] Every year I got the flu shot I ended up sic k as a dog, I haven't gotten the flu shot in 9 years.. I haven't been sick once and I have ch anged nothing in my daily life. Again, we examined this quotation in Chapter 4 as a n example of the belief that vaccines can infect patients with the disease they seek to preve nt. We can now see the risk-benefit calculation associated with that belief. The same influence of absence versus presence may increasingly apply, ironically, as incidence rates of vaccine-pr eventable diseases decline, due to \"dilution of benefit\" as described by Poland and Jacobson (2001) : \"As the widespread use of a vaccine diminishes or eliminates the risk of a disease, the public's perception of the vaccines' value paradoxically diminishes\" (p. 2443). Also mixed into the omission-commission negotiatio n is the influence of regret, as Brown et al. (2010) found. \"Vaccine-acceptors,\" th ey write, \"anticipated regret from vaccinating and from not vaccinating with roughly equal frequen cy, whilst far more vaccine-decliners anticipated regret from vaccinating than from not v accinating\" (p. 4244). Here, the difference between pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine beliefs appear s to depend on whether the believer anticipates regret from action or from inaction. A s Serpell and Green (2006) put it: People see events caused by their actions as their responsibility\u2014and hence foresee feeling guilty if they go wrong. They do not alway s see events following from inaction 112 in the same light... If parents see potential [vaccin e adverse effects] as their fault but [diseases] as acts of God they will be biased towar ds non-vaccination. (p. 4044). Hence those anticipating regret from inaction appea r more likely to hold pro-vaccination beliefs, as expressed in the collected data: [5.2] As a parent I cannot imagine the regret I wou ld feel if my child ever got a disease because I listened to morons on the internet. Similarly, people feeling the regret of past action seem more likely to apply retrospective anti- vaccination interpretations: [5.3] I feel tremendous guilt in knowing I allowed my daughter to be shot up with poison and I even helped in keeping her still to do so. Ho w I wish I could go back in time and choose differently. However, anticipated regret also motivates anti-vac cination belief, as many parents anticipate regret at injuring their child, as in the following quotation from an interview subject who believes that the chances of vaccine injury are sli m, but nonetheless eschews most vaccines: [5.4] You've done it to your child. You're the one who has brought them into the thing. It's not like a random disease that just hits them. You're the one who has done it to them. Even if you did it meaning well. The deliberation between action and inaction is par ticularly striking here, where the mother apparently perceives her own culpability in having \"done it to [the] child\" with a vaccine as stronger than the inaction of a \"random disease.\" In these examples, the regret influences the prospective decision of whether to vaccinate (5.2 a nd 5.4) as well as the retrospective interpretation of injury (5.3). At first, it may seem as though risk-benefit anal yses cannot be retrospective, once previously hypothetical outcomes have become known. Many parents developed anti-vaccine beliefs after their child was vaccinated and had wh at they perceive to be a reaction to the vaccine. In some ways, this appears not to result from a risk-benefit analysis. On the other hand, 113 even once outcomes such as a diagnosis of autism ar e known, the causes are still uncertain. Parents who attribute their child's autism to a vac cine, therefore, are retrospectively reevaluating their initial risk-benefit comparison by increasing their interpretation of the costs. It may be useful to distinguish here between risk-benefit ana lyses, where risk is an assessment of an unknown future, and cost-benefit analyses, where co st is an assessment of the outcome of past action. Prospective risk-benefit evaluations appea r to influence vaccine decision making, while retrospective cost-benefit evaluations appear to in fluence post-vaccine interpretations. The same retrospective evaluation might cause a parent who d id not vaccinate to regret it when the child gets a vaccine-preventable disease. Logically, how ever, it would seem that retrospective cost- benefit evaluations only influence beliefs in cases of regret, for parents with healthy children will likely attribute health to having made the proper v accination choice, rather than reevaluate it. This suggests that time, too, is a notable compone nt of the analysis, not only in terms of assessment of the future or reassessment of the pas t, but also to the extent that risk and benefits appear different at different times. Hall (2004) p oints out that the choice to adopt an innovation is often not between whether to adopt or not, but b etween whether to adopt now or defer the decision. Since a vaccine is an irreversible decis ion, many parents who question its safety undoubtedly elect to decline or defer the vaccine b ecause that decision is the reversible one (Serpell & Green, 2006). A similar calculation is at the heart of the \"too many, too soon\" argument that children are given too many vaccines at a young age. The risks at a younger age, or before the child attends school, or when infecti on rates are low, may all seem different than they might at a different time. The comparison is not limited to the risks and ben efits of the various options, as often the very concept of safety itself is defined through a risk-benefit calculation. The Vaccine Education 114 Center on the website of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (2013) cautions against defining safety as an absolute: \"The first definiti on of the word safe is 'harmless.' This definition would imply that any negative consequence of a vacc ine would make the vaccine unsafe. Using this definition, no vaccine is 100 percent safe\" (p ara. 1). Indeed, some people in the data do define safety with exactly that expectation: [5.5] what's interesting is the scientists and doct ors cannot guarantee and PROVE that there is not a link between autism and vaccinations . Until they can do that, why would I want to even play with my child's health in that wa y. If there's even a one percent chance that they could be linked, that is too much for me. As the CHOP website notes, this absolutist standard of safety is hard to meet, and we more routinely define safety through risk-benefit calcul ations: [E]very year in the United States, 350 people are killed in bath- or shower-related accidents, 200 people are killed when food lodges i n their windpipe, and 100 people are struck and killed by lightning. However, few of us consider eating solid food, taking a bath, or walking outside on a rainy day as unsafe a ctivities. We just figure that the benefits of the activity clearly outweigh the risks . While the CHOP website was captured in the data col lected for this study, it does not contain user comments and therefore does not offer insight into how individual users evaluate its claims. Nonetheless, some users in the data do express more or less the same concept of safety: [5.6] They are safe, or rather, they are safer than many many other common medical procedures and medicines. Risk/benefit tell s us that it's far better to vaccinate on schedule than to let nature decide when and how sick your children will be. Thus the balancing of risk and benefit goes beyond a comparison of shot to disease in order to encapsulate the definition of safety itself. 115 Of course, if safety amounts to a lack of risk, it still may not tip a risk-benefit scale without some counterweighing benefit, as explained by this interview subject who rejects most vaccines as unnecessary, even if they are completel y safe: [5.7] Safety is not the only thing. Why do it? It's a need thing. Here, what we identified in Chapter 4 as a rejectio n of the premise of vaccination, specifically that vaccines are unnecessary, is justified in term s of having little evidence for tipping the scale toward benefit. Another factor that is important to vaccination in particular is weighing the risks and benefits to one's own child against the risks and b enefits to society as a whole. As Serpell and Green (2006) have observed, \"available information about risks is about average risk. What the parent wants to know is not what is the risk to chi ldren in general, but what is the risk to their particular child\" (p. 4042, italics in original.) Some view vaccinat ion as providing herd immunity for the benefit of entire populations of c hildren: [5.8] Frankly I think that those who choose not to vaccinate are putting a lot more people at risk than just your own child. [4.77] . If you don't believe in vaccinating your children against deadly diseases, you should have to move to the middle of nowhere where your little plaguebearer can't hurt anyone else. Others dislike the idea of endangering their own ch ild in order to protect the population as a whole: [5.9] they say that \"small\" risk of a handful of ch ildren is a risk that is worth it for all the people that are \"saved\" from disease. I wonder, wou ld it be worth the risk to you if it were YOUR child that was unfortunate enough to have the fatal reaction? I wouldn't accept that my child should might die from a vaccin e given to keep the rest of the population \"safe\" [5.10] At this point I think Id rather take the cha nce that everyone eles will vaccinate their children and wait and see what does cause Aut ism. 116 This is one of many areas where \"us versus them\" co nflicts arise in the vaccine safety debate. As we will discuss later, a similar contrast frames vaccine safety as a conflict between parents and pharmaceutical companies, and vaccine safety kn owledge as a conflict between personal experience and impersonal data (Kata, 2010). This also highlights the conflict discussed in Chapter 4 between civil liberty and civic responsib ility. Here again, the risk-benefit consideration is not merely a matter of the vaccine versus the disease, but a matter of whose interests should be protected among an assortment o f players including parents, children, corporations, doctors, scientists and the greater g ood. A somewhat paradoxical view of society's role in t he risk-benefit assessment implies that vaccinated children are not risking enough. This u nderlies the preference for natural methods discussed in Chapter 4 in its implication that the risk of vaccines is the risk of interfering with th e natural order and flow of childhood and a child's b ody: [4.51] We don't need to be 'protected' from them A LL. Our natural immunity does its job quite well. It doesn't need to be exposed to d iseases from other continents in order to maintain health. Underlying this quote's suggestion that children ma y be too \"protected\" is the idea that vaccines inhibit the body's natural response: [5. 11] Vaccines suppress the natural immunity and the body does not have natural antibodies anymore. Where others have blamed vaccination for injury, co mmenters like these now blame it for protection and suppression. In some sense, this is the opposite risk-benefit framing from vaccine injury concerns. Here the concern is that not risk ing diseases means not enjoying the benefits of natural immunity. In terms of risk-benefit calcula tions, these people view the risk of vaccines as going beyond the possibility of injury to a single child, but rather to increase all of society's risk of getting diseases: 117 [5.12] polio was all but gone until they brought a vaccine out that started it up again, you do some research and come back to me Indeed, the subject of one interview frames her cho ice not to vaccinate as a criticism of risk averse modern society: [5.13] It's a culture now where you have to wrap yo ur child in bubble wrap. You cannot let them take a risk anywhere... We're out there to e njoy our world, and part of that is taking risks. Now, I wouldn't say that, you know, 'Oh good, let's get sick.\" But I think part of what a doctor's role is, is to protect at a ny cost, pretty much, your child. And just like, you know, you put a fence up, \"Oh no, I'm sor ry, you can only look at the waterfall, you can't go play in it,\" well, you're protecting t hem, but at the cost of their emotional and mental health. And it's the same with the vacc ine. You're protecting them, protecting them, but at what cost? Again this underscores that the negotiation is not simply between a risky disease and a beneficial vaccine, but sometimes even the opposite\u2014a risky va ccine and a beneficial disease. While a rudimentary understanding might expect anti-vaccina tion beliefs to be risk averse, those exalting natural immunity and natural experience often consi der the risk averse ones to be the vaccinated. Overall, therefore, comparisons between risk and b enefit arise from considerations of myriad factors. The most basic comparison of a dis ease to a shot depends on contextual evaluations of multiple factors. Particularly rele vant to evaluations of vaccine safety are considerations of omission versus commission and th e needs of individuals versus societies, which are in turn influenced by considerations of r egret (experienced or anticipated), timing, and the very definition of safety. To the extent that the Internet may play some role in such negotiations, we may presume that people researching vaccine safety on the Inter net would seek information regarding the degree of the respective risks. It is therefore no table that Betsch et al. (2010) found that, compared to controls, anti-vaccination websites inc reased users' perceptions of the risk of vaccinating and decreased their perception of the r isk of not vaccinating. We should not 118 presume that this finding is specific to the Intern et, however, as it may result from exposure to similar information in any medium. On the other ha nd, Downs et al. (2008) found that 93% of their respondents said they would use the Internet to search for information, and that same percentage would find anti-vaccination websites in the first 10 results, which were more commonly found using simple search terms than preci se ones, suggesting that anti-vaccination websites \"might be most accessible to individuals w ith the least knowledge\" about vaccines (p. 1604; also Betsch, 2011.) Hence the keyword-based algorithms of most Internet search engines may overrepresent vaccination risks compared to the vaccine benefits that are the popular and scientific consensus. Importantly, recent changes to the Google search algorithm now include more medical \"facts\" in search results (Ramaswami, 2015). Some have already seen evidence that anti-vaccination search results are less promi nently ranked (Plait, 2015). Also, future algorithmic updates may rank information based on f acts rather than links (Dong et al., 2015). However, since these changes are new and not univer sal to all search engines, it is still likely that the Internet overrepresented risk to the people rep resented in the data collected for this study. Once we understand risk-benefit as the basic evalu ation, we can expand upon it to understand specific techniques people use to evalua te risks and benefits. Consider the many calculations and assumptions that underlie the foll owing conversation: [5.14] how many of you would raise your hands and h onestly say...I would take the chance of giving my child Autism as long as they ge t the MMR vaccine? only someone who has a vested interest in the programs longevity would respond 'yes' [5.15] [responds to 5.14] I would and I have. My so n didn't get it from MMR, he had it since birth. I would rather him be autistic then ri sk him contracting a disease that could be worse on his body and potentially harm hundreds of people because I chose not to vaccinate him, he could even die, why risk that on others, and put the public at RISK, I am in the medical field and until you see what dise ases and polio, measles, mumps and rubella can do to babies and young at risk kids wit h other health issues, I wouldn't be so quick to assume or say it's the MMR vaccine. 119 [5.16] [responds to 5.15] REALLY!?! You would rath er your child be autistic than putting the public at risk. WOW! I wonder what your child would have chosen. The risks articulated or implied in this conversati on are: the risk of autism, the risk of disease, the risk to others, the risk of death, the risk to the public, and the risk to children. The benefits considered are: the benefit of avoiding the MMR, t he benefit to \"the programs longevity,\" the benefit of preventing disease, the benefit to the p ublic, and the benefit to children. In turn, each comparison of these risks to these benefits relies upon an assortment of beliefs and assumptions that inform the negotiation. Quotation 5.14, for e xample, relies upon the assumption that the MMR vaccine has a chance of causing autism, and tha t pro-vaccination beliefs could only be motivated by a \"vested interest in the program.\" Quotation 5.15 relies upon the assumption that autism is detectable at birth, that vaccine-prevent able diseases are worse than autism, that non- vaccination harms others, and that vaccines can pre vent the diseases, among others. Quotation 5.16 relies upon the assumption that one's own chil d's well-being is more important than society, and indeed that one is risking either the child or society rather than helping both. Notably, each of these assumptions is challenged in the collected data, as discussed in Chapter 4. Understanding them as a risk-benefit analysis, furt hermore, does not explain the underlying assumptions on which they are based. Hence to full y understand the justification of belief through risk-benefit analysis, one must also unders tand the origin of the beliefs that support each side of the risk-benefit ledger. The collected data offers suggestions of how each believer arrived at those underlying assumptions. The first such technique is endemic t o risk-benefit analyses, which are implicitly a claim to having reasoned one's way through the evid ence toward the proper conclusion about vaccine safety. 120 Reason People who do not object to vaccines (which are mo st people, Raja & Mooney, 2014) might intuitively think of vaccine safety beliefs a s a matter of reason. The popular framing of opposing vaccination beliefs often represents the d ebate in terms of the rational compared to the irrational, the informed compared to the uninformed , or even the sane compared to the crazy. Interestingly, each side claims rationality for its elf and attributes irrationality to the other. Regardless of the ultimate conclusion, reason is co mmonly exalted as an essential tool for proper evaluation of vaccine safety, and its application i s presumed to reveal the right conclusion. The use of the term \"reason\" to describe this eval uation tactic does not imply reasonableness, nor is it the same as \"having reaso ns.\" Rather, it is intended to describe a particular means of using evidence in which beliefs are attributed to rational processes such as logic. As a category, reason is not always discret e, since risk-benefit calculations, for example, are themselves a form of reasoning. Likewise, as w e shall discuss shortly, the use of \"pure\" reason is complicated by emotional, social and cult ural influences. Nonetheless, it does seem worth examining this evaluation tactic separately, since recurrent in the data are examples of people justifying their beliefs in the terminology of rationality, regardless of whether others might consider that reasoning to by biased or other wise flawed. There are several ways in which people justify their vaccine safety beliefs using r eason, including basic inference from premises, correlation, and a reliance on published science. Those for whom reason is an identifiable source of their beliefs often adopt inferential language structures to demonstrate the drawing of c onclusions from premises. Note, for example, the if-then inferences articulated in the following quotations: [4.18] If it 's vaccines, then why are Boys are 5x more likely th an girls [to have autism]????? 121 [5.17] why is there a compensation fund for vaccine injured children and a website specifically to report adverse reactions if it neve r happens. While most inferences are less explicitly stated, t he data is rife with such examples of commenters supporting their beliefs by framing them as reasonable conclusions. Often the inference is based on correlation, as in this example from Chapter 4: [4.12] Common sense says there has to be a correlat ion....\"Fastest-growing developmental disability; 1,148% growth rate [of au tism cases].\" Vaccine schedule in 1983 - 10 vaccines. Vaccine schedule 2013 - 36-38.. ...huh! and we are seeing a growth rate of 1,148%!!!! THERE is your scientific researc h. Think for yourselves people. Here, the overt claim to \"common sense,\" the refere nce to \"correlation\" and the comparison to \"scientific research\" all make the appeal to reason explicit. But most telling is the final sentence's invitation to \"Think for yourselves,\" wh ich implies the belief that thought leads to truth, and what's more, that that thought must be i ndependent and critical. Indeed, critical thinking is seen on opposing sides of the debate as essential to truthful understanding, as if to imply that without proper reason one cannot know th e truth about vaccine safety. Other commenters call upon the conclusions of scie nce, with its roots in rationalism and deduction from evidence, to support their vaccine s afety beliefs: [5.18] here's a great study of half a million danis h, a good section were not vaccinated- generally the same rates [of autism]. [5.19] i can make a fucking correlation between ban ana consumption and autism if i wanted to. I would like some real, solid science be fore you maniacs kill off more people. [4.3] Could you please provide scientific justifica tion as to how injecting a human being with a confirmed neurotoxin is beneficial to human health and prevents disease? [4.21] There are no studies done on combination vac cines and how they react with one another. Not to mention any reactions with other e nvironmental, drug or food chemicals or toxins. 122 As discussed in Chapter 4, some people overtly reje ct science as a uselessly compromised way of knowing, but others on opposing sides of the debate do rely upon it, which implies a reliance on its deduction from evidence. Notably, scientific e vidence is not the only kind of evidence supporting vaccine safety beliefs, as many also rel y upon the findings of courts: [5.20] a fact that (vaccines cause autism) has been admitted by the USVaccine Court. About 83 suspected cases of vaccines causing autism have been awarded compensation. [5.21] My question to you is... how is it junk scie nce when mothers and fathers have won lawsuits based off of evidence that these vaccines DO IN FACT cause Autism??? The court would not give them over a million dollars if there was no evidence supporting the claims. That evidence is called SCIENCE not \"junk s cience\" [5.22] the courts are full of lawyers, NOT Scientif ic experts Although the kinds of evidence and the sources of e vidence vary from believer to believer, the underlying process of reasoning from evidence under lies these beliefs. Reason is not only used as a means of supporting b elief, but is also quite commonly used to dismiss beliefs from the other side of the debat e, as in quotations 5.21 and 5.22 above (among others) and the following: [5.23] Correlation is not causation. I also bet you r child ate something the day that they started to 'change,' perhaps you could go on a witc h hunt and blame that food product for autism as well. In particular, advocates of one position tend to at tribute the other position to reasoning flaws. Colloquially, the attributed flaws include stupidit y and insanity, as in quotation 5.19 above (and 4.69 and 4.70 in Chapter 4), but are also framed in more sophisticated, science-evoking language like \"correlation is not causation\" in quotation 5. 23. In scholarship, many apply taxonomies of reasoning flaws to explain misinformed belief (Gilo vich, 1991; Shermer, 2011). Jacobson, Targonski and Poland (2007) apply Gilovich's taxon omy specifically to anti-vaccine beliefs. They examine preferences for predictability over ra ndomness, the use of flawed data, wishful 123 thinking, miscommunication, and \"exaggerated impres sions of social support\" (p. 3147). The present study, however, does not seek to judge the correctness or incorrectness of the application of reason, so much as to describe the means of its application. Taxonomies of errors are therefore of limited use in addressing our research questions. One commonly cited explanation for belief in misin formation that may be of use, however, is the influence of bias. Although bias i s also considered an error, it does shed light on our research questions by suggesting influences on the evaluation of factual claims, and what may cause a preference for one factual claim over a nother. We have already explored in Chapter 4 how bias is sometimes used to dismiss the claims of others who are perceived to be biased. The collected data also provides evidence of bias i nfluencing one's own interpretation of evidence. In particular, the data provides some ev idence of motivated reasoning and confirmation bias, which refer to a believer's tendency to evaluate in formation in a way that confirms what they already believe (Hart et al., 20 09; Kuklinski et al., 2000; Poltorak et al., 2005) and to resist correction 2012; Nyhan & Reifler, 2010; As discussed in Ch apter 4, vaccine skeptics see financial conflicts of interest as motivating pro-vaccine rea soning. What may motivate vaccine safety reasoning\u2014both positive and negative\u2014is the somewha t more complicated interplay of reason and emotion. Motivated Reasoning A recent meta-analysis (Hart et al., 2009) found t hat people were nearly twice as likely to select information that confirmed their beliefs as information that challenged them. Similarly, Kuklinski et al., (2000) found that people tended t o resist facts that contradicted their firmly held beliefs, and Nyhan and Reifler (2010) found that t he misinformed resisted correction to their 124 beliefs, and often the correction made them even mo re likely to believe the misinformation. They later investigated corrections specifically ab out vaccine safety, and discovered that none of the corrections were effective in changing beliefs (Nyhan et al., 2014). Even those presented with evidence from both sides of an issue tend to u ncritically accept the confirmations while expending extra effort to justify and discount the contradictions (Munro, 2010). Most strikingly, as Kuklinski et al., discovered, \"those holding the least accurate beliefs perversely expressed the highest confidence in them\" (p. 798). Interestingl y, one study of parents opinions toward vaccines (Poltorak et al., 2005) found that \"only t hose mothers who researched to support a previously felt position ended up making a decision they felt clear about,\" (p. 715). The influence of preexisting beliefs on the evaluation of evidence may be one of the best studied aspects of belief formation. Of course, such behavior would account for the Int ernet's echo chamber effects (Pariser, 2011; Sunstein, 2007), suggesting that the filterin g out of contradictory information may not be a new phenomenon, but merely the technological empowe rment of a preexisting human tendency. Other researchers, however, (Garrett, 2009; Jang, 2 014) find that an Internet users' selective exposure to information that cocoons them in echo c hambers may have been overstated. Instead, Garrett found that while participants in his study did seek information that reinforced their beliefs, they did not avoid information that challe nged it. Hence the process of information search and retrieval appears to be more complicated than merely selective exposure, emphasizing the question of how individuals translate confirmin g and disconfirming evidence into individualized belief. While such effects have usually been observed in p sychology experiments utilizing methods that the present study does not employ, we are nonetheless able to observe in the 125 collected data some examples consistent with those findings. For example, in both Internet data and in interviews people doubting vaccine safety co mplained about not being able to find sources that tell \"both sides.\" On one hand, this would se em to be evidence that people do seek confirming and disconfirming evidence. On the othe r hand, it does not appear to be a common complaint among those convinced of the safety of va ccines. It may actually be a lament that those with anti-vaccination beliefs are not finding as much confirmatory evidence as they would like. This suggests that the reason mainstream med ical sources are not considered legitimate may be because they are inconsistent with minds alr eady made up. As another example, consider the predisposition ar ticulated in the following comment: [5.24] We put off letting our son having the MMR un til he was 18 months old through fear and then it was reported that Dr Wakefield was scaremongering and that there was no link to autism. So we decided ok we best get our son vaccinated. Within 2 days our very content, happy little boy changed. He started screaming, bashing his head against the wall, hitting himself, biting me, kicking me and th e list goes on. According to theories of motivated reasoning, we sh ould not be surprised to see a person previously apprehensive about vaccines attributing a child's behavior to a vaccine reaction. Indeed, Andrews et al. (2002) found that predispose d parents were more likely to misremember the proximity of the MMR vaccine and the onset of a utism symptoms. This provides further insight into the retrospective cost-benefit reevalu ation discussed earlier. It suggests that, at lea st as these parents remember it now, they correctly as sessed vaccines as being risky, but proceeded with vaccination anyway only to regret it. For the m, the retrospective cost-benefit analysis is not so much a reevaluation as a vindication: [5.25] I had said I didn't want my daughter to get the amazingly useless, devastatingly dangerous hepatitis-B vaccine at the hospital when she was born, but they gave it to her without asking permission, and she reacted with fou r days and nights of endless screaming, vaccine-induced encephalitis, and was la ter diagnosed with autism. 126 Regardless of whether this parent's interpretation of events is correct or not, there is a clear suggestion in the recounting of the event that pree xisting beliefs influence subsequent interpretation. Specifically, the belief that the vaccine is \"amazingly useless, devastatingly dangerous\" may be the seed of the subsequent belief that the reaction was \"vaccine-induced\" and the connection with an even \"later\" diagnosis of au tism. Of course, we have not observed this person's belief before and after the vaccine, and s o cannot measure the precise influence of prior beliefs upon subsequent ones. We can, however, obs erve in the way the event is recounted how important this believer considers the prior belief to have been. Again, while this quotation certainly does not prove the influence of motivated reasoning, it is at least consistent with it. Perhaps even more compelling evidence of the influ ence of bias upon belief is the conversion of what one side of the debate considers a refutation into what the other side considers proof. For example, as discussed in Chap ter 4, pro-vaccine beliefs view data about the genetic origins of autism as refuting any connectio n between vaccines and autism. Anti-vaccine beliefs, however, view this data as consistent with the vaccine-autism connection: [4.19] Whether some carry a genetic trait/gene/trig ger that predisposes them to Autism with the MMR vaccine being what flips that switch n eeds to be researched further. CAUSE or TRIGGER? In this way, one side's genetic evidence becomes t he other side's evidence of harm, as in the following quotation that acknowledges the presence of autism at birth, but still attributes it to vaccine injury: [5.26] I do still believe that my son acquired auti sm at birth, or very shortly after. But I am convinced it was the vaccines that did it. HepB vaccine is given at birth, after all. How can anyone honestly say vaccines have no role g iven that? 127 The contrast may be even clearer in the following p air of quotations. The first is from a hospital's webpage about vaccine safety, and is use d as evidence that autism is caused by genetics and not vaccines: [5.27] Researchers found that when one identical t win had autism, the chance that the other twin had autism was about 90 percent; for fra ternal twins, the chance was less than 10 percent. In a user comment elsewhere, essentially the same e vidence is used to support the opposite conclusion, that vaccines are the cause of autism: [5.28] How do you then explain that twins who were perfectly fine before having the MMR and shortly after the vaccination BOTH diagnose d with Autism? The contradiction between these conclusions support s the suggestion that evidence evaluation is a subjective and individualized process subject to the influence of preexisting biases. Another event commonly seen as a pro-vaccine refut ation of the vaccine-autism connection, the retraction and de-licensing of Andr ew Wakefield (recounted in Chapter 2), is subject to a similar reframing: [5.29] There seems to have been an attempt recently on the part of some Max-Vax advocates to imply in the press that the retraction of this one publication has answered all the questions on vaccines and autism. [5.30] Andrew Wakefield has found himself the victi m of a world-wide smear campaign by drug corporations, governments and media compani es. And while Dr. Wakefield has been persecuted and prosecuted to the extent of bei ng unable to legally practice medicine because of his discovery, he has instead become a b est-selling author. Rather than a refutation of the vaccine-autism conn ection, anti-vaccine beliefs view Wakefield's fate as proof that the compromised integrity of the medical establishment is against them. Again, the collected data is consistent with the substanti al literature suggesting that the protection of preexisting beliefs motivates the formation of subs equent ones. 128 The tone adopted in these quotations also supports the related theory that emotion is a principal motivator of reasoning. As we have seen, quotation 5.25 adopts expressly emotional language such as \"amazingly useless, devastatingly dangerous\" as well as vivid details that enhance the emotionality of the account, such as \"e ndless screaming.\" The vivid specificity of quotation 5.24 is similarly emotional in first desc ribing \"our very content, happy little boy\" and then the details that he \"started screaming, bashin g his head against the wall, hitting himself, biting me, kicking me and the list goes on.\" The s pecific detail of this account, and the contrast between the boy before and after, heightens the emo tion expressed in a way that would not be as effective were those details absent: [5.24, edited] We put off letting our son having th e MMR until he was 18 months old... and then it was reported that... there was no link to autism. So we decided ok we best get our son vaccinated. Within 2 days our ... boy changed . The presence of such emotional language suggests th e emotional influence of the events on the person describing them, including, according to psy chology theories of motivated reasoning, the influence of that emotion upon reasoning. Haidt (2001), while writing about moral decision ma king, nonetheless offers insights into how humans reason about other matters. In particul ar, he emphasizes the essential role of intuition in rational processes, and that \"moral re asoning is generally a post hoc construction intended to justify automatic moral intuitions\" (p. 823) because \"we use conscious reflection to mull over a problem until one side feels right. The n we stop\" (p. 829). According to Mooney (2011), brain imaging research has documented the h uman tendency to register an emotional response to an idea so quickly that the thinker is unaware of it. We then engage in reasoning in a subconscious attempt to rationalize the emotional r esponse we have already formed. To modify a metaphor of Haidt's, while we may believe that in our reasoning we act like detectives\u2014129 following the evidence toward the best conclusion\u2014i nstead we often act like lawyers\u2014 advocating for a position and aligning the evidence to support it. In practice, this means that \"once people find supporting evidence, even a singl e piece of bad evidence, they often stop the search\" (Haidt, p. 821). It is easy to see the rel evance of that finding for Internet searches, where that single piece of bad evidence may be easier to find than ever, and the easily-found refutation may never be sought. Haidt describes the result of this in a way that could well have been a description of arguments on the Internet: Both sides believe that their positions are based o n reasoning about the facts and issues involved... Both sides present what they take to be e xcellent arguments in support of their positions. Both sides expect the other side t o be responsive to such reasons .... When the other side fails to be affected by such go od reasons, each side concludes that the other side must be closed minded or insincere. (p. 823). As no Internet user will be surprised to hear, the dynamics that Haidt describes appear repeatedly in the data collected from comments sections. Again, Haidt is specifically describing moral reas oning, which may have limited applicability to vaccine safety beliefs, but in doi ng so he draws upon research about many kinds of reasoning, and his conclusions are consistent wi th psychology research regarding decision making and risk analysis that is more overtly appli cable to vaccines. Of particular relevance is the work of Slovic et al. (2004) which explores the relationship between reason and emotion with regard to evaluations of risk specifically. Slovic et al. differentiate between an \"analytic system\" and an \"experiential system\" which correlate more o r less with reason and emotion, as well as with the perhaps more famous \"System 1\" and \"System 2\" of Kahneman (2011). Rather than seeing these systems in contradiction to each other , however, Slovic et al. emphasize the 130 interrelationship between the systems and the ways in which they complement each other. The experiential system relies on affect , which Slovic et al. define as a fast, automatic i ntuition about whether something is good or bad. Rather than bein g inferior to, or in opposition to, reasoned decisions, experiential evaluations are an essentia l part of risk evaluation as a whole. This is because the efficiency of the experiential system g uides us in situations where the analytic system would be too slow, such as in the avoidance of immediate danger. This intuitive system also builds upon our past experience to prevent our having to start every evaluation of risk at zero. Affect is a kind of shortcut that assists an alysis, rather than contradicting it. Importantly, as we shall explore further in a moment, affect is ubiquitous on the Internet, and likely influences what searchers seek and what they avoid (Yang & Kah lor, 2013). The relationship of affect to risk evaluation mean s that when people consider risks, such as the risks of receiving or declining a vaccinatio n, they base their decisions partly on the good- versus-bad intuition of affect. If their feelings toward an activity are favorable, they are moved toward judging the risks as low and the benefits as high; if their feelings toward it are unfavorable, they tend to judge the opposite\u2014high risk and low benefit. Under this model, affect comes prior to, and directs, judgments of risk and benefit (Slovic et al., 2004, p. 315). This suggests that judgments of vaccine safety aris e from intuitive responses as much as purely reasoned ones. This may provide a mechanism for th e formation of Internet echo chambers to the extent that affective intuitions might guide us er's choice of information sources more than rational evaluation does (Haidt, 2001; Yang & Kahlo r, 2013). Many of the characteristics that Slovic et al. (200 4) attribute to the experiential system are overtly applicable to vaccine safety beliefs. Slovic et al. characterize the experiential system 131 as (among other things) pleasure-pain oriented, inf luenced by past experiences, \"self-evidently valid: 'exp eriencing is believing'\" (p. 313). All of these characteristics are directly observable in the coll ected data, which is rife with accounts of past experience, personal narratives, and suggestions of self-evidence, just like those we have seen in quotation 5.24. Personal Experience Emotional, personal experiences are exceedingly co mmon both in the collected data and in other research about vaccine safety beliefs on t he Internet (Betsch, 2011; Betsch et al., 2012; Davies et Mills et al. , 2005; Nicholson & Leask, 2012). While many such studies do not quantify personal anecdotes abo ut vaccine safety, Kata (2010) found them on 88% of websites in her study. In Betsch's (2011) sa mple of eight anti-vaccination websites, seven contained emotive appeals, and anti-vaccinati on websites were much more likely than controls to contain personal narratives, most of wh ich were vaccine-negative (Betsch et al., 2012). Many, many parents in the present study def end their beliefs with anecdotes about their personal experience, suggesting that that experienc e was among the evidence most persuasive to them. [5.31] IF ALL THIS IS SO TRUE CAN YOU TELL ME WHY M Y SON IS DEAD AND THEY FOUND THIMEROSAL IN HIS SYSTEM AFTER DEATH .. ONE DAY AFTER HE WAS GIV[EN] HIS 2 MONTH SHOTS... It is not difficult to understand how an experience like the one relayed in this comment could influence parents' beliefs about vaccine safety. I n asking research questions such as those of this study\u2014essentially, why do people believe this?\u2014the persuasive power of personal experience looms large, both in quantity and in power. If the evidence people use to justify their beliefs is 132 the evidence they themselves find most convincing, then emotional, personal experiences appear to be the most convincing evidence of all: [5.32] my cousin was a fine and healthy baby till h e got a Vaccine and then he got Autism. and that is proof enough for me. [5.33] within 2 hours[of the vaccines] he had a fev er of 104 F. ... After one week, the fever finally passed but he no longer functioned th e same. He lost all his language, zoned out, spun around, stopped eating a variety of foods (only wanted French fries) and his bowels were completely messed up. That was many yea rs ago... Dec. 9 1998. The life of our entire family changed that day. He hasn't had a vaccine since. Pro-vaccine explanations for autism such as changed definition, increased diagnosis and the timing of appearance of symptoms must seem very unc ompelling compared to an experience of watching one's loved one change. At the same time, we might wonder whether there is any reason why such personal testimonials need to be vaccine-negative. Not all of them are. Examples of pro-vaccine personal stories do appear in the collected data, perhaps as an intentional counterpoint to anti-vaccine anecdotes, or perhaps as evidence of the strength o f personal experience and strong feeling as motivators of diverse beliefs on opposing sides of the controversy: [5.34] Have any of you actually HAD the diseases th is vaccine seeks to prevent? ... I've had the measles ... I have never in my life been so s ick. I had to lie in a dark room for two weeks so that I didn't go blind. These examples would seem to be just as compelling as the anti-vaccination examples, and just as emotional. At the same time, as we have noted, Betsch et al. (2012) found that more of such content was vaccine-negative than vaccine-positive. In Chapter 4, we enumerated several vaccine belief s that we can now understand as having been based on personal experience. This inc ludes rejection of the attribution of autism to a change in diagnostic criteria: 133 [4.14] With all due respect, I was born in the 1950 's and I can say emphatically that there WERE NOT that many \"mentally deficient\" people of A NY kind. Not 1 in 50, not 1 in 100, not 1 in 200. SOMETHING accounts for the radic al increase in this kind of disorder, and I can assure you there has been a radical incre ase. You are reciting one of the favorite mantras of today's propaganda that vaccines and aut ism couldn't possibly be linked. Personal experience also often motivates the belief that vaccine-preventable diseases are not serious, diminishing the benefit side of the risk-b enefit calculation: [4.39] I was born in 1944. It was considered a nor mal part of childhood to contract measles, mumps, and chicken pox. They were not con sidered dangerous diseases. I never knew or heard personally of anyone who died o f these diseases. [4.40] ha ha ha! measles, mumps had them both. it was great. I got 3 weeks off school both times and got to go bowling with mom instead o f school. Don't remember how sick I was. just being treated special and going bowlin g and no school! Bring it on! It was way better than getting Autism that's for sure! Indeed, the observation that vaccination is a victi m of its own success draws upon the fact that people no longer have much personal experience with vaccine preventable diseases. In the following quote from an interview, the interviewee 's anti-vaccination beliefs are reinforced by the lack of personal experience of outbreaks, but p ro-vaccination beliefs emerge with regard to threats she has experienced: [5.35] That 's never happened around here. I mean, you know, no t a single outbreak ... I would be surprised if there ever was ... The biggest problem we have around here is lice. Get an immunization for that, I 'm all over it! [Laughter.] Totally serious. That 's the last thing I want, is lice. Similarly, personal experience is often used to jus tify the opposite belief that the diseases are in fact dangerous, enhancing the benefit side of the c alculation: [4.44] I grew up in the fiftys too. I also contract ed all of the childhood diseases, measels, mumps, chickenpox etc. Something else happened to m e in the fiftys. My father contracted Polio during the epidemic in the early 1 950s and he DIED from it. He was a 134 healthy, strapping, six foot tall 26 year old. He s irvived in a iron lung for 1 year before dying. In addition, as we have noted, retrospective cost-b enefit evaluations are motivated by personal experience: [5.3] I feel tremendous guilt in knowing I allowed my daughter to be shot up with poison and I even helped in keeping her still to do so. Ho w I wish I could go back in time and choose differently. Furthermore, of course, the influence of guilt in a risk-benefit calculation is explicitly an emotional influence: [5.36] We allowed my son to get this once after the pediatrician sort of bullied me into it... he was never the same afterwards. It broke ou r hearts -- my husband and I both cried for days over it and still discuss the event becaus e we are still dealing with the behavioral and physical aftermath of what we did to him... :( Our daughter has NEVER had a vaccine due to this and never will if we can protec t her from them. Even those risk-benefit analyses which compare the risk to one's own child to that of society as a whole derive from a prioritization of individual ex perience, even if only anticipated, over the collective experience of society, as emphasized by this excerpt from quotation 5.9: [5.9] I wonder, would it be worth the risk to you i f it were YOUR child that was unfortunate enough to have the fatal reaction? Also, the appeal to get vaccinated for the greater good is often framed around the emotional power of fear: [5.37] If you don't vaccinate your children, you ar e doing a criminal act against them, if they ever catch one of these disease, it will horri fic. Looking again at these beliefs we have previously e xamined illuminates more and more the justification of belief. Vaccine safety is fundame ntally a risk-benefit calculation, based on reasoning through the risks and benefits of a parti cular vaccine for a particular person, a process which is heavily influenced by emotional, personal experiences either anticipated or regretted. 135 This is one way in which the Internet may indeed m ake a difference in how people believe. Because Web 2.0's participatory tools ena ble user-generated content, the Internet increases access to and prominence of personal test imonials, emotional appeals, and anecdotal evidence (Betsch, & Zikmund-Fisher, 2012). Web 2.0 is built on sharing, and sharing amo unts to self-disclosure, both produced and consumed. Us Versus Them Nicholson and Leask (2012) note that these kinds o f appeals challenge ideas of evidence that dominate medical discourse in favor of more pe rsonal kinds of evidence, and furthermore that the Internet's \"giving voice to wider publics\" (p. 3807) augments that more populist evidence. Moore and Stilgoe (2009) note this trend in the MMR vaccine controversy and elsewhere, where \"a significant feature of such tes timonies is a narrative of unjustified rejection by expertise\" (p. 663), as is certainly observable in the collected data: [5.38] Strange how doctors' treatment of our childr en is driven by parental input of data \u2014 yet that empirical evidence gets reflexively down graded to anecdotal if one reports vaccine adverse reactions. This is supported by Kata's (2010) findings that h alf of websites in her sample portrayed an \"us versus them\" conflict between parents and the medic al establishment that were often seen as dismissive of personal concerns and blindly favorin g aggregate data over individual experience (see also Moore & Stilgoe, 2009; Munro, 2010; Witte man & Zikmund-Fisher, 2012). [5.39] The numerous peer-reviewed studies... provide ample scientific confirmation of vaccine risks, but fail to capture the horrific dam age and painful experiences that real families undergo everyday. Calling thousands of sim ilar personal stories \"anecdotes\" is a dismissive tactic used to discount their significan ce. Personal stories are another form of evidence. 136 Of course, the Internet's magnification of individu al contribution and redefinition of expertise (Keen, 2006) both play directly into this conflict between established knowledge hierarchies and personal knowledge networks (Quandt, 2012). That most such content is anti-vaccine (Betsch et al., 2012) is presumably because the anti-establishment voice of vaccine-negative belief s, considered to be on the fringe of mainstream discourse, finds no better venue than th e Internet (Jenkins & Thorburn, 2003; Stempel et al., 2007). Witteman and Zikmund-Fisher (2012) observe that while there is certainly pro-vaccine content online, even in alternative, us er-generated content such as blogs, there is no real online community of people who have benefited from vaccination. As we have discussed, vaccination is preventative and its benefits are a non-occurrence rather than an occurrence. Therefore people have little emotional experience o f vaccine benefits (Betsch et al., 2012) and have no need to seek a community online. It is the people who think they have suffered vaccine injuries that find themselves scorned by the offici al, mainstream community and have few venues as easily accessible as the Internet. This is consistent with long-time media studies research suggesting that alienated groups use alter native media because the mainstream media will not take them seriously (Jenkins & Thorburn). Taken together, these factors\u2014the prevalence of an ecdotal accounts of personal experience, the opposition to traditional sources o f expertise and the magnification of both of these factors on the Internet\u2014highlight that in thi s debate, firsthand experience is exalted as superior to other forms of evidence: [5.40] Anyone can spout numbers and statistics, but when a mother tells me that she noticed a direct change in her child which she beli eves occured due to the vaccination that is proof enough for me. Parental instincts are to protect your child, and most parents can naturally sense when something is not right. Pe ople trying to diagnose any one illness, disease, syndrome, etc would do well to pa y more attention to the personal 137 accounts of those affected rather than the findings of some study. I myself have seen FIRST HAND how vaccinations can affect certain indi vuduals. Reason-based conclusions deduced from population-le vel scientific data have little chance of being as convincing as experiences like these (Moor e and Stilgoe, 2009). There is an interesting contrast here with the ide a of social epistemology (Fallis, 2006, 2008; Wilson, 1983) according to which very little human knowledge is acquired firsthand through primary experience. Instead, most knowledge is acquired secondhand through other sources upon whose representations we rely. In sim ple terms, most things that we believe, we believe because we take someone else's word for it. This idea seems particularly applicable to the Internet, which is essentially a collection of secondary sources. Authority A key idea at the center of social epistemology, a s defined by Wilson (1983) and subsequently applied to the World Wide Web by Rieh (Rieh, 2002; Rieh & Belkin, 1998) is the idea of cognitive authority . While there are other kinds of authority, such a s the authority to make laws or enforce them, cognitive authority is t he particular kind of authority that underlies knowledge and belief. Put simply, cognitive author ity is the authority to claim knowledge. As one person receives information from another, he or she evaluates the cognitive authority of the claimant and decides whether or not to believe the particular claim. For example, one might ascribe high cognitive authority to one's doctor an d therefore trust the information she provides and incorporate it into one's own knowledge. Alter natively, one might ascribe low cognitive authority to a particular politician and decide not to trust the information provided. (As discussed in Chapter 1, such concepts as trust and credibilit y are related to, even if distinguishable from, cognitive authority.) In the collected data, appeal s to authority\u2014and explanations of how people evaluate authority\u2014are exceedingly common. 138 The ideas of social epistemology and cognitive aut hority may be particularly important when considering misinformation on the Internet (Fa llis 2008; Rieh, 2002; Rieh & Belkin, 1998). The Internet is constructed (mostly) by humans and thus the evidence there is socially constructed, secondhand evidence. The Internet its elf contains little if any primary, direct evidence of vaccine safety. To the extent that the Internet, then, is a collection of secondary sources, social epistemology may be essential to un derstanding it as a source of knowledge. In turn, cognitive authority, as a key aspect of socia l epistemology, would also be key to understanding knowledge acquisition on the Internet , and understanding how cognitive authority is evaluated would be key to understanding how evid ence is evaluated, beliefs are formed, and knowledge is acquired. Cognitive Authority of the Self At the most basic level, people posting comments o n the Internet seek to establish cognitive authority through the citation of facts. In essence, this amounts to claiming \"I have cognitive authority because I have knowledge\", as i n the following comment: [4.45] FACT, diseases have ALWAYS ebbed and flowed before vaccines and continue to do so. Note that the citation of facts is not unique to th e anti-vaccination side of the debate, as pro- vaccination facts are cited in a similar fashion: [5.41] Autism generally starts to show at around th e age they now give the MMR vaccine. At this level of authority, only the factual claim is made. The claimer apparently expects the claim to speak for itself, and does not provide any external evidence that supports or vouches for his or her ability to know. 139 At what we might consider a higher level of author ity, people attempt to support their claim to authority with some other means such as a citation of sources or establishment of credentials. When attempting to support one's own cognitive authority, a very common means is citing one's own credentials: [5.42] Being a nurse I find this article very distu rbing. First off - the CDC would NOT administer vaccines that are harmful Again, this strategy is common to opposing sides of the debate: [5.43] I am a registered Nurse and a mom. I too be lieve that there are far more illness caused by todays shot requirements then is prevente d. Claims to cognitive authority based on citation of one's own credentials are based on an underlying assumption that amounts to \"I know becau se of my expertise and training.\" This may appear to be, contra social epistemology, a claim to firsthand knowledg e. Of course, expertise such as nursing credentials is acquired through edu cation, a thoroughly secondhand means of acquiring knowledge. But these claims regarding on e's own credentials are not framed in those terms. The claim is not to having a nurse's educat ion, but rather to being a nurse. Even citations to education, akin to \"I have a PhD\" or \"I have a d egree in biology\" emphasize the first person knowledge status rather than the secondhand means o f learning. In fact, common cultural practice is usually to emphasize the secondhand mea ns of acquiring knowledge only when implying that the knowledge is incomplete, as in \"I went to nursing school\" or \"I took Biology classes\" which carry the implicit suggestion that o ne nonetheless did not become a nurse or biologist. Hence the strongest claims to cognitive authority based on one's own credentials equate one's knowledge status with one's identity r ather than with one's learning practice. This dresses the secondhand knowledge of education in th e terminology of the firsthand knowledge of experience. 140 Often, however the claims to the superiority of fi rsthand knowledge are more explicit. It is interesting to note in quotation 5.43 above the commenter's reliance not only on her medical expertise as a nurse, but on her additional experti se as a mom, by which she apparently intends to strengthen her claim to cognitive authority. As we have already discussed, personal experience is very often cited as a reason for beliefs about vaccine safety. In epistemological t erms, this means citing personal experience as a supporting credential for one's own claim to cognit ive authority. [5.44] My credentials is what happen to my child [5.45] I have to inform you that NO ONE knows a chi ld/baby better than its own mother! What is going on here is NOT a mere random correlat ion of events, nor coincidences\" ........ God gives us wisdom as mothers,.......some thing that perhaps you need to know and consider before making such foolish claims. These p arents KNOW what they are saying, and they KNOW what the truth is!!! These kinds of appeals, of course, are explicitly claims that firsthand experience is superior to secondary experience, is in fact more reliable, and hence that social epistemology is inadequate. Some people take this so far as to claim that with out personal experience, one has no cognitive authority on the issue at all: [5.46] If you're just talking to talk and don't hav e any children with Austism, your output is worth zero. This position is emblematic of something Nicholson and Leask (2012) have noted, that \"parents of autistic children were seen to understand the is sue because they had lived it. By that measure, doctors, scientists and governments were seen as le ss eligible to provide evidence because they did not have this tangible experience\" (p. 3810.) Often, this rejection goes so far as to characterize scientific methods as inappropriate or incapable of addressing the issue (Munro, 141 2010). For such parents, the only credentials that establish cognitive authority about vaccine safety are personal experiences with autism. In general, the establishing of one's own expertis e may be more important on the Internet than in other information sources. Since authority on many parts of the Internet is not established through traditional markers such as tho se found in encyclopedias, newspapers, etc, such claims do not automatically inherit the credib ility of their source (Metzger, 2002; Rie h & Belkin, 1998). This is, of course, particularly true of comments sections. Each person making a factual claim must establish his or her authority independently, increasing the need to cite one's own credentials in such environments. This requirement can also be empower ing, because the Internet provides an ability to establish authority that one may not pre viously have had. Anti-vaccination beliefs seem to take particular strength from this ability. Perhaps in previous information environments, one could have believed one had the authority to di sagree with the consensus of a number of organizations, but prior to the Internet, one likel y had less ability to exercise that authority. As we have already noted, the importance of perso nal authority may be enhanced by the personal nature of the Internet. Betsch et al. (20 12), van Zoonen (2012) and Witteman and Zikmund-Fisher (2012) note how the user participati on tools of Web 2.0 increase the amount of personal authority available. In particular, as B etsch (2011) notes, the interactive tools of social media make personal, anecdotal testimony both easie r to post and easier to find. The prevalence of this kind of data may enhance its influence, esp ecially to those inclined to find the testimony of parents more trustworthy than official, traditio nal sources which, as Serpell and Green (2006) put it, \"may be seen as having some self-interested investment in conspiring against the public, whereas the motivation of the parent of a child wit h autism is less obviously open to question.\" 142 (p. 4042-4043).This would seem to apply more broadl y than just social media to include other participatory aspects of the Internet as well, comm ents sections certainly among them. It is important to note, however, the way in which many arguments about the individual empowerment of Web 2.0 technologies depend on anecd otes on the Internet being persuasive to others. As Betsch et al. (2012) put it Narratives of purported vaccination injuries includ e all of the key elements of memorable messages: They are easy to understand, concrete, cr edible in the way in which a first person story of victimization is always credible (\" I was there!\") and highly emotional. These qualities make this type of information compe lling (p. 3730). The assertion here is that the prevalence of emotio nal anecdotes on the Internet contributes to misinformation about vaccines because emotional ane cdotes are so persuasive. In the data collected for this study, however, the re is much more evidence of people being persuaded by what happened to them than by wh at they hear happened to others. At least two other studies noted a lack of peer pressure as an influence on vaccination (Evans et al., 2001; Poltorak et al., 2005), observing instead a prefere nce for \"people making their own choice\" (Poltorak et al., p. 908). This is important in li ght of the common aspersion that the anti-vaccine movement prefers the authority of celebrities like Jenny McCarthy to the authority of doctors (as in quote 4.80 in Chapter 4.) Few if any people cit e Jenny McCarthy as a source of their belief. Rather, some champion her as a spokesperson for the ir own experiences. At the same time, the influence of opinion leaders on the diffusion of in formation is well-researched (Rogers, 2002; Hall, 2004) and peers can be particularly influenti al on belief (Granovetter, 1973; 1985). Indeed, some of the present study's interview subjects spok e of living in an area where vaccine safety doubts seemed more common than elsewhere. This is consistent with epidemiological data that 143 low vaccination rates tend to cluster geographicall y (Lieu, Ray, Klein, Chung & Kulldorff, 2015; Omer et al., 2008). Of particular relevance to the present study, Kareklas et al. (2015) found that user comments could influence people's belief in a public service announcement about vaccines more than the announcement itself. Importantly, ho wever, the comments used were all either supportive or critical of vaccination, not mixed. This is a much different environment than the comments data collected for the present study, whic h is often back-and-forth disagreement. However it may appropriately reflect the typical re search habits of a pro- or anti-vaccination person who may choose an Internet source where the majority or all of the comments agree. Overall, the emphasis of the present data is not on the extent to which vaccine safety beliefs might be influenced by secondhand accounts of the p ersonal experiences of others. Rather, it provides numerous examples of firsthand experiences justifying one's own belief. While Web 2.0 may mean that the modern media envir onment is saturated with accounts of personal experiences, the experiences probably p ersuade those who had them much more than those who hear about them. Importantly, these comp elling emotional experiences did not take place on the Internet. Therefore while the Internet may increase the persuasiveness of secondary experience, it seems unlikely that it affects the f irsthand experience that so compels vaccine safety beliefs. To the extent that secondary testimony of others d oes seem to influence such beliefs, it is more commonly seen as cumulative support for person al experiences: [4.15] How do you explain the countless examples of children who literally changed overnight immediately after receiving their inocula tion? Coincidence? On the Internet, ease of access to similar experien ces may influence how one interprets one's own experiences, such as when a parent of an autist ic child finds an explanation in the vaccine injury allegations of others. Similarly, the Inter net may enhance the appearance of consensus, as 144 when a parent suspecting his or her child has been vaccine damaged finds corroborating anecdotes on the Internet. While this does sugges t ways in which the prevalence of personal, emotional anecdotes on the Internet might influence belief, it may work differently than Betsch et al. (2012) describe. Rather than creating misin formed belief, the Internet may simply support beliefs already formed offline, exactly as echo cha mber hypotheses feared. Cognitive Authority of Others This is not to suggest, however, the failure of so cial epistemology as an explanation of Internet knowledge acquisition. Indeed, there is m uch evidence in the collected data of beliefs formed or supported through social means, including means that are enhanced by or even unique to the technology of the Internet. Some commenters defend their views by identifying t he source of their knowledge. At the most basic level, this means a general citation of the source of a claim: [5.47] O'Shea has a... book called \"Vaccination is no t immunization\" that is a must read for anyone interested in the facts. In this book he has lots of data that is backed by references and a lot of doctor support for his work . Here, the commenter refers to a source that he or s he finds credible, including basic reference information, but does not provide any credentials t o establish the source's cognitive authority. One is left to find, investigate and evaluate the source oneself. This particular quotation does take the extra step of attempting to enhance the so urce's authority by referring to \"data,\" \"references\" and \"doctor support,\" but again this i s non-specific and leaves any potential reader of the comment to do his or her own investigation. Some commenters assemble more specific support for the authority of their sources. As with individuals seeking to establish their own aut hority, some cite the credentials of others to establish the cognitive authority of sources. 145 [5.48] The supreme court ruled, that vaccines are u navoidably unsafe. The highest court in the land. Though it probably was unnecessary to do so, this c ommenter reinforces the source of his own knowledge by emphasizing that it is the \"highest co urt in the land.\" Claims regarding the credentials of others are als o used for the opposite purpose, to question or undermine the cognitive authority cited by another. Sometimes, this technique is used in an attempt to discredit the authority someo ne has claimed for themselves: [5.49] Who cares that you're an RN? There are RN's that disagree with you. There are M.D.'S that agree with you and there are M.D.'s tha t don't agree with you. Other times it attempts to discredit an authority t hat someone else has cited: [5.50] [He] is not a \"doctor.\" He has a PhD in comp uter science from what was then a unaccredited degree mill. And his \"research\" has no t been repeated nor validated. A particularly common tool for attacking the cognit ive authority of another is the accusation of bias, as we saw in Chapter 4: [4.70] It sounds to me like you... are either a kickb ack taking doctor, a pharmaceutical representative, or one of the \"herds\" that has been brainwashed into believing all doctors are gods. Get a grip or get a brain. [4.56] LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH in this country is do ctors and pharmaceuticals. What a huge cover up. I don't trust the medical in dustry they are all about the $$$$$. Accusations like these function not only to undermi ne the authority someone else has claimed; they also attempt to bolster the authority of the c ritic. In quotation 5.50, the commenter resorts to the first technique we discussed, the citation o f unsubstantiated facts, in order to position his or her own authority as superior to that of the per son being criticized (both the doctor and the person who cited the doctor.) In quotations 4.70 a nd 4.56 the integrity of the stated position is alleged to be compromised by financial incentives t hat may undermine objectivity. At the same 146 time, these comments imply the superior insight of the commenters who are not misled by bias. Yet again on the Internet we observe the exaltation of personal authority above all other kinds. The following quotation is even more illustrative of this phenomenon: [5.51] So have you researched and tested the vaccin es yourself? have you conducted thorough studies? Here again is an articulated challenge to the very idea of social epistemology. Implicit in this comment is the assertion that no secondhand knowled ge can suffice, but that only people who have conducted firsthand research could possibly ha ve appropriate cognitive authority. While the quote is unique and its demands atypical, it de monstrates by exaggeration the contradictory logic of cognitive authority about vaccine safety o n the Internet. On the one hand, the Internet is seen as a platform for the discovery of previously unavailable truths, and for the airing of anti- establishment positions. Thus the Internet is seen as the place where repressed testimony is at last being heard. On the other hand, the Internet is a collection of secondary sources, and indeed does not lend itself to firsthand research of vacci ne safety, and therefore all of its claims are demonstrably unreliable, especially to those who di sagree. To unpack this contradiction further, we might con sider the ways in which cognitive authority seems to function differently on the Inte rnet than elsewhere. While the various aspects of cognitive authority discussed thus far are prese nt on the Internet, none of them are particularly unique to the Internet. People do make and have ma de unsubstantiated factual claims in every information environment. They sometimes support th ose assertions by citing their credentials, or with non-specific references to the source of their knowledge. They even debate each others' claim to know, including accusations of bias. All of these negotiations over cognitive authority could take place in an argument in a bar (before th e age of Internet-connected mobile devices); they are no different just because that argument ta kes place on the Internet. To some degree, 147 however, the technology of the Internet alters the negotiation of cognitive authority in ways that are not available in other information environments . The most obvious of these is the use of linking. The Internet provides the unique ability not only to refer to a source, but to provide it di rectly to someone else. While in the aforementioned bar fight we might be lucky enough t o be carrying a particular source in our bag, on the Internet every source is in our virtual bag, and our ability to provide it to others is nearly effortless and limitless. [5.18] here's a great study of half a million danis h, a good section were not vaccinated- generally the same rates [of autism]. [provides lin k] [5.52] Actually, there are plenty of studies that l ink autism to vaccines. This is a link to a list of approximately 150 scientists and physicians who have serious concerns about vaccine safety. [provides link] The Internet, therefore, enables us to establish co gnitive authority with a mere cut and paste, and to verify cognitive authority with a mere click. T his is so easy, in fact, that it seems to raise the expectation of evidence required on the web: [5.53] Where is an article that links specific unva ccinated individuals to having a disease and infecting other people. [5.54] Please post the text of the court decision \" admitting\" your assertions. Can't find it? Neither can I. I *can* find lots of sloppy ar ticles on this and related sites, claiming that a monetary awards damage \"proves\" the vaccine link [to autism.] Comments such as these suggest that the expectation s for evidence are higher on the Internet because of the ease of retrieval. It is perhaps no t enough merely to provide the secondhand experience of naming sources; one is expected to pr ovide the ability for a firsthand evaluation of the source. It is interesting to speculate, howev er, on whether this actually raises the standard of evidence or only appears to. It seems unlikely tha t most people click the links at all, much less read the entire article. (Indeed, there is evidenc e in the collected data of commenters who have 148 not even thoroughly read the article on which they are commenting.) Therefore, this apparent demand for citation on the Internet may functionall y be a demand for the appearance of evidence that few if any people will actually verify. There are other suggestions in the collected data about how the Internet may raise the expectation of evidence. Much like the ease of lin king may raise the demand for citation, so the ease of search and retrieval seems to raise the dem and to inform oneself: [5.12] polio was all but gone until they brought a vaccine out that started it up again, you do some research and come back to me Implicit in comments like this one, which are quite common in the collected data, is the suggestion that if \"you\" disagree, it is because \"y ou\" have not done proper research. This is more than just a claim of the ignorance of others; it amounts to a positivist claim that truth is available if only one looks. It does not suggest wh ere \"you\" might do research, or that you might disagree with what you find. It suggests that, at least as far as this commenter believes, it is sufficient merely to do research at all. The claim to cognitive authority is here based on self- evidence. No sources or credentials are believed t o be needed, as the truth is so obvious it will reveal itself. At the same time, these apparently positivist clai ms have a contradictory postmodernist underpinning. As Kata (2010; 2012) has noted, the implied disregard for traditional cognitive authorities is rooted in a postmodernist redefiniti on of expertise. Of course, the redefinition of expertise is also a frequently noted consequence of Web 2.0 (Keen, 2006). A call to do research implies a call to look beyond traditional expertise and empower oneself to find and to know, as explicitly stated in the following quotation: [5.55] Free-thinking mothers who do their own resea rch are not fooled by this pathetic propoganda, and to expect us to robotically accept these flat-out lies mixed with twisted \"truths\" is nothing short of an insult to our intel ligence. 149 This quotation repeats the claim to self-evidence o f quotation 5.12 and adds the important additional layer of doing one's \"own\" research. Th is suggests that other sources are not to be trusted, but even more importantly, implies the sup eriority of the individual user's knowledge acquisition abilities. Again, as van Zoonen (2012) and Witteman and Zikmund-Fisher (2012) have noted, the specific tools of Web 2.0 may lend themselves to such a concept of research, both in the way that Web 2.0 enhances user particip ation in creating information and in accessing it, but also in the way that the open architecture of the Internet makes \"informed decision making\" easier. As Witteman and Zikmund-Fisher put it: Online openness means that data and information are readily accessible and may be questioned, corrected and built upon to create new knowledge... As Web 2.0 progressively allows free and open access to data, more and more decisions... are becoming recast as being within the purview of indi viduals (p. 3736). For Internet users displeased with traditional sour ces of cognitive authority, as is often the case with those concerned about vaccine safety, the Inte rnet's enabling of one's \"own research\" implies a truth now unobscured because of the Inter net, there to be discovered as self-evident once one makes the effort to look. This is the imp lication of quotation 5.55 in its comparison of the \"free-thinking\" enabled by the Internet with th e \"pathetic propoganda [ sic ]\" of others claiming cognitive authority on the issue. Such a quotation serves as almost a manifesto in its exaltation of firsthand knowledge, which at last ha s broken free from the \"lies\" and \"twisted 'truths'\" of pro-vaccination authorities. It implie s a point at which one ascribes cognitive authority to oneself, as if to say, \"my research is superior to what anyone else tells me, and hence my cognitive authority is superior to everyone else 's.\" This is perhaps the most powerful claim to firsthand knowledge of them all. 150 In summary then, while the Internet would seem to be a collection of secondhand knowledge, it is also rife with exaltation of first hand knowledge as a superior, and uniquely accessible, means of knowing. In particular, the participatory tools of the Internet seem to influence how cognitive authority is established an d appraised. Whether through citation of sources, the establishing of credentials, or the ob jection to them, cognitive authority functions through a rich and complex set of negotiations amon g Internet users. To the extent that reasoning about vaccine safety derives from examina tion of evidence, the Internet enhances that examination through the ease with which users can p rovide, retrieve and verify that evidence through searching and linking. In the data collecte d for this study, the ease of informing oneself rises to the level of claims of self-evident truth, alleged to be available to all who conduct proper research. Consistent with concerns about Internet echo chambers, however, such research is often influenced by pre-existing beliefs, particula rly those rooted in firsthand personal experience. To the extent that such experiences ar e persuasive in risk evaluation, it is relevant that the user participation technologies of Web 2.0 appear to make accounts of those experiences more prevalent on the Internet than in other media. Furthermore, the quantity of negative anecdotes apparently increases in areas where the I nternet provides a haven for beliefs in opposition to mainstream thought and traditional ex pertise. Notably, it is those very boundaries between traditional, mainstream belief and alienate d, minority belief that often define what counts as misinformation and what does not, under t he presumption that consensus belief is accurate and contrary belief misinformed. A Model of Evidence Evaluation Although we have divided belief justification into four discrete categories\u2014risk-benefit, reason, personal experience and authority\u2014the forma tion of belief in practice is rarely so 151 modular, nor does it take place in steps or in a pa rticular order. Indeed, the distinctions are fuzzy at best, since risk-benefit calculations are a kind of reasoning and personal experience is a kind of authority. While all beliefs about vaccine safe ty amount to risk-benefit determinations, those determinations rely upon reason, personal experienc e and authority in complex patterns that vary across beliefs, believers and situations. Therefor e we should not think of the four techniques of belief justification as operating independently, bu t rather in an overlapping Venn-like relationship wherein the core risk-benefit stance i s negotiated through reason, personal experience and authority, which in turn influence e ach other (Figure 5.1). Figure 5.1. Relationship between elements of belief justificat ion. This diagram illustrates the primary relationships between the means of justification most prominent in the collected data. The central evalu ation of risk and benefit is derived from some combination of reason, personal experience and auth ority. In turn, personal experience influences both reason and authority. Risk -benefit Reason Authority Personal experience 152 Other conceivable relationships may exist, such as ways in which reason may determine which authority to believe, although that overlap i s not prominent in the present data. Every distinction between two things risks oversimplifyin g those things, as this model may well do. But the model intends to highlight the primary rela tionships that emerge strongly from the data, even if other relationships are potentially present . In summary, to the extent that the way people just ify their beliefs illustrates how they evaluate evidence, vaccine safety beliefs appear to compare the risks of vaccination to its benefits. Each evaluator primarily determines the risk and benefit of the various elements\u2014 including vaccines, diseases and schedules\u2014by reaso ning through evidence, comparing it to personal experience, and determining which authorit y to believe. Personal experiences, especially emotional ones, motivate reasoning to be consistent with previous beliefs. They likewise influence which authorities are considered credible, often to the extent that one's own authority, based upon personal experience, trumps a ny claims inconsistent with it. The overall picture painted in the data is that these four eval uation tactics, in these primary combinations, sort through contradictory evidence to arrange a li mited, recurring set of beliefs into diverse viewpoints. 153 CHAPTER SIX CONCLUSIONS In combination, the beliefs outlined in Chapter 4 and the justification tactics outlined in Chapter 5 begin to untangle why some people believe vaccines are safe and some believe they are unsafe. Again, these generalizations about bel ief are based upon the assumption that present tense justifications for beliefs reflect the past t ense process of belief formation. We must be careful to remember that how someone justifies thei r belief on the Internet or in an interview is not the same as the actual process of forming it. For example, we are unable to distinguish whether a believer relied upon certain evidence bef ore deciding what to believe, or whether that believer subsequently adopted that evidence as rein forcement. Despite this, from the way that someone expresses and justifies a belief we may inf er what they find convincing, and to a significant if imperfect extent we may begin to und erstand how and why they believe. In particular, the evaluation strategies explored in Chapter 5 expand and illuminate the buffet metaphor of belief profiles discussed in Cha pter 4. As with food items in a buffet, the available beliefs are limited, as the same beliefs recur over and over in the data. Yet just as each patron of a buffet can combine the limited selectio ns into individualized meals, so do people combine vaccine beliefs into individualized combina tions. Buffet diners select food to suit their taste, considering such factors as what food they l ike, what food they are in the mood for, the need to eat a balanced meal and the extent to which one item might go well with another. At least in the case of vaccine safety, belief \"taste\" seems to consist of the evaluation tactics from Chapter 5 which guide the selection of items. In o ther words, just as food items are chosen through a combination of pre-existing influences an d present circumstances, so too are beliefs, as there appears to be a relationship between certain beliefs and the tactics used to evaluate them. 154 Associations Between Beliefs and Evaluation Tactics Comparing the beliefs discussed in Chapter 4 to th e evaluation tactics discussed in Chapter 5 suggests associations between certain bel iefs and certain tactics. Table 6.1 suggests relationships between the four primary categories o f belief outlined in Chapter 4 and the four tactics of evaluation outlined in Chapter 5. Assoc iations are drawn based upon observation of common trends in the collected data. The strength and weakness of the associations reflect the ease of identifying examples of each association in the data. The division into anti-vaccination and pro-vaccination tactics reflects the degree to which each tactic appears to justify anti- vaccination and pro-vaccination beliefs, respective ly. The associations reflected in this table have not been rigorously counted nor statistically correlated; they represent qualitative and not quantitative assessment. Table 6.1: Associations between beliefs and evalu ation tactics BELIEFS Anti -vaccination tactics Pro -vaccination tactics Strong Weak Strong Weak Toxicity Risk -benefit Personal experience Reason Authority Risk -benefit Reason Authority Cumulative effects Risk -benefit Personal experience Reason Authority Risk -benefit Reason Authority Premise of immunization Risk -benefit Reason Personal experience Authority Risk -benefit Reason Authority Personal experience Compromised integrity Authority Risk -benefit Reason Personal experience Authority Risk -benefit Reason As we have seen, the primary decision about vaccine safety\u2014whether to get a particular vaccine or not\u2014is a risk-benefit analysis, in that it is overall a consideration of whether the vaccine is too big a risk or provides a big enough benefit. The specific beliefs that comprise that overall decision\u2014the four beliefs listed in Table 6 .1\u2014are themselves based upon risk-benefit 155 calculations to varying degrees. Beliefs about toxi city, for example, represent an analysis of the risk of toxicity as compared to the risk of foregoi ng the vaccine. Beliefs about the cumulative effects of vaccines are comparisons between the ris ks of multiple vaccines or combined vaccines as compared to the risk of delayed or selective vac cination. Anti-vaccination beliefs about the premise of vaccination view both the benefit of the vaccine and the risk of the disease to be low. Beliefs about compromised integrity seem to be the least dependent on risk-benefit evaluations, but the related beliefs about civil liberties compa re the risk to society against the risk to the individual. While each of these negotiations is pr obably influenced by reason, personal experience, and authority, it does seem as though s ome of these elements support certain beliefs more than others. For example, consider how people might form anti-v accine beliefs about toxicity. They may use reason to determine that since mercury, alu minum and formaldehyde can be dangerous, vaccines can be dangerous too. They may also rejec t the assurances of medical authorities, although that rejection likely derives from other b eliefs, such as about compromised integrity. Neither reason nor authority, however, seems as str ong a motivator as emotional responses such as fear and disgust. The idea of putting certain s ubstances into a human body arouses visceral negative reactions, as reflected in descriptions su ch as \"poison.\" While such believers may reject the medical community's attempts to reassure them, it seems likely that the emotional reaction to toxicity inspires the rejection of authority rather than the rejection inspiring the emotional reaction. What's more, the use of reason and autho rity to defend anti-vaccination beliefs about toxicity seems more common as a counter to the reas on and authority used to defend pro- vaccination beliefs. Thus the toxicity row of Table 6.1 represents reason and authority as weak anti-vaccination tactics and personal experience as a strong anti-vaccination tactic. 156 On the other hand, beliefs that toxicity is not a concern would seem to rely less on emotion and more on reason-based appeals to chemist ry and trust in medical authorities. Many people holding pro-vaccination beliefs about toxici ty seem to reject emotional testimonials about the timing of vaccines and autism symptoms, preferr ing reason-based understandings of coincidence versus causation. Likewise, many pro-v accination believers counter the toxicity of ingredients with reasoned analyses of dose sizes an d chemical properties. They may also simply believe the FDA and CDC's assurances that vaccines are safe. Meanwhile, there are few if any examples of how personal experience might motivate pro-vaccination beliefs about toxicity, and hence Table 6.1 lists reason and authority as stron gly associated tactics and does not list personal experience at all. A similar balance of tactics appears to underlie b eliefs about the cumulative effects of vaccines. People with anti-vaccination beliefs abou t cumulative effects often fear introducing too many substances into a young child's system (an emo tional response that we categorize as personal experience). Some also reason that autism and other negative outcomes are attributable to the rise in the number of vaccines given, and ac cuse medical authorities of insufficiently understanding cumulative effects. People with pro- vaccination beliefs about cumulative effects tend to downplay emotional responses in favor of th e reasoned conclusion that disease protection should be acquired as early as possible. Likewise, they tend to rely on the assurances of medical authorities that the recommended schedule is safe. Thus the strategies used to evaluate cumulative effects are essentially the same as thos e used to evaluate toxicity. Beliefs about the premise of immunization, however , seem to arise from a slightly different combination of tactics. People who deny the premise of immunization often speak of personal experiences such as a bad reaction to a va ccine or infections with vaccine preventable 157 diseases that were benign. People who accept the p remise of vaccination similarly rely upon negative personal experiences with vaccine preventa ble diseases. Since most people do not personally experience a prevented disease, however, they must rely on the representations of others that the vaccine prevents the disease. Henc e for pro-vaccine beliefs about the premise of immunization, authority seems a stronger motivator than personal experience, and the rejection of such authority is correspondingly characteristic of anti-vaccination beliefs. Many believers apply reason to reach opposing conclusions. Those with pro-vaccination beliefs often justify them with evidence such as declining rates of infec tious disease. Those with anti-vaccination beliefs question those rates, and often refer to co ncerns believed to arise from the injection of a disease agent into an otherwise healthy body. Thus reason is a strong motivator on opposing sides of the debate between beliefs about the premi se of immunization, while authority and personal experience are also employed on opposing s ides, but to differing degrees. Beliefs about compromised integrity seem most stro ngly rooted in considerations of authority. A belief that a person's integrity has been compromised amounts to a belief that they do not have the authority to know. Secondarily, th is is a reason-based evaluation, since part of the calculation is the extent to which the compromi sed integrity influences the evaluation of authority. For example, Paul Offit, who has writte n extensively in support of vaccines, is often seen to be hopelessly compromised by having patente d a rotavirus vaccine (see quotation 6.4, below.) Pro-vaccination arguments, however, consid er this patent evidence of his expertise on the topic. There may be some element of personal e xperience as well, since some people who have had unpleasant healthcare experiences cite the m to justify anti-vaccination beliefs about compromised integrity. Overall, however, beliefs a bout compromised integrity seem to amount to reasoning through evidence about the authority o f sources. 158 Overall across the four categories of belief, the pattern is consistent with buffet-style belief formation. On the one hand, the situation r esembles popular conceptions: anti- vaccination belief derives heavily from emotional p ersonal experience, and pro-vaccination belief relies heavily on authority and reason. As depicted in Table 6.1, emotional personal experiences are strongly associated with three anti -vaccination beliefs and weakly associated with only one pro-vaccination one, suggesting that emotion and personal experience are particularly persuasive to anti-vaccination belief. This is not always the case, however, as is particularly evident in the strong emotional reacti on some people have toward those they perceive to be endangering society by not vaccinati ng. And importantly, there are people with anti-vaccination beliefs who do not have personal e xperiences such as vaccine injury, and thus attributing anti-vaccination beliefs entirely to em otion and personal experience would leave many cases unexplained. Perhaps more surprising is the strength of reason and authority as motivators of anti- vaccination beliefs. Authority has strong associat ions with all four categories of pro-vaccination belief, and only one strong and three weak associat ions with anti-vaccination belief. Nonetheless, authority appears as a motivator for e very belief, even if to varying degrees. Importantly, anti-vaccination beliefs about comprom ised integrity are fundamentally beliefs about authority, and people often justify anti-vacc ination beliefs using alternative authorities, suggesting that it is not a matter of whether autho rity is used but of what is considered appropriate authority. Likewise, opposing sides of the debate justify their beliefs using reason, which associates either strongly or weakly with eve ry category of belief, having four strong associations and four weak ones. The disagreement is as to what constitutes correct and incorrect applications of reason. The ultimate ins ight appears to be, therefore, that vaccine safety 159 beliefs are not a matter of the presence or absence of any particular evaluation tactic so much as of the degree to which the tactic is employed. Importantly, these examples do not outline every p ossible combination of beliefs or evaluation tactics. It would be an oversimplificat ion to imply that belief x always derives from tactic y or never derives from tactic z. As the buffet metaphor implies, beliefs are comp lex and virtually any combination of beliefs and tactics is possible. The noted associations are subjective and other associations are conceivable, although th ey do not appear in the present data to any significant degree. Even the evaluation tactics th emselves are not always discrete, as discussed in Chapter 5. At the same time, some combinations of beliefs and tactics are more common than others. Similar Tactics A useful insight of this analysis may be the obser ved use of similar tactics to justify diverse, and often opposing, beliefs. While each p erson uses the tactics in different ways and to different degrees, the same basic tactics are used. Hence the construction of individualized belief profiles from among a limited buffet of beliefs may derive from the selection from a limited buffet of tactics, in individualized combinations. Indeed, sometimes this similarity of tactics is overtly emphasized in the data: [6.1] The MMR vaccine is NOT the cause; it has been around a long time, while autism has steadily rose with the increase in proceesed fo ods. [6.2] [in response to 6.1]: So aren't you doing th e exact same thing that you are accusing others of? You are blaming junk food. Please show m e the studies that show that junk food causes autism. The commenter in quotation 6.1 justifies the belief using reason, rejecting the correlation between the MMR and autism as spurious while noting a correlation between processed foods and autism. The responding comment also applies re ason to implicitly note the conflation of 160 causation with correlation, then adds an appeal to the authority of scientific studies. While this is a particularly overt example, we have already seen examples of beliefs on opposing sides arising from each of the tactics we have identified. Consider the use of the risk-benefit comparisons w e have repeatedly identified as fundamental. They are applied from all sides of t he issue, as we saw in the following quotations: [5.1] Every child I will ever have will be vaccinat ed, even if there is a possibility of autism, even if it's strong, because I could never consider the chance of autism as more important than the life of my child. [4.41] One person out of a thousand died from an ou tbreak of measles? Those odds are a lot better than putting every kid at risk for autis m. Again, while the tactic of a risk-benefit considera tion may be applied differently by different people to reach different conclusions, it is fundam entally the same tactic regardless of who applies it. To see this, consider the same quotat ions abstracted to their core logical structure: [5.1a] Every child I will ever have will be [statu s], even if there is a possibility of [risk 1], even if it's strong, because I could never cons ider the chance of [risk 1] as more important than the life of my child. [4.41a] One person out of a thousand died from [ris k 1]? Those odds are a lot better than putting every kid at risk for [risk 2]. Note that absent the specifics of what the risk is, these sentences say essentially the same thing. To see this even more clearly, note the change when the opposite risk is substituted into each position. Making risk 1 \"autism\" and risk 2 \"a vac cine preventable disease\" makes both statements pro-vaccination: [5.1b] child I will ever have will be [vacci nated], even if there is a possibility of [autism], even if it's strong, because I could neve r consider the chance of [autism] as more important than the life of my child. [4.41b] One person out of a thousand died from [aut ism]? Those odds are a lot better than putting every kid at risk for [a vaccine preve ntable disease]. 161 Likewise, reversing the risks, so that risk 1 is \"a vaccine preventable disease\" and risk 2 is \"autism\" makes both statements anti-vaccination: [5.1c] Every child I will ever have will be [unvac cinated], even if there is a possibility of [a vaccine preventable disease], even if it's stron g, because I could never consider the chance of [a vaccine preventable disease] as more i mportant than the life of my child. [4.41c] One person out of a thousand died from [a v accine preventable disease]? Those odds are a lot better than putting every kid at ris k for [autism]. Clearly, the difference in these statements is not how they consider evidence, but what evidence they consider. In other words, both use the same r isk-benefit analysis, but base it on different characterizations of risk and of benefit. We have likewise already observed similar uses of reason to reach opposing conclusions. A common example is when one commenter uses reason to refute a previous reason-based assertion, as in quotations 6.1 and 6.2 above. Ano ther example is when the same techniques of reason arrive at opposing conclusions: [4.18] If it's vaccines, then why are Boys are 5x more likely than girls [to have autism]????? [5.17] why is there a compensation fund for vaccine injured children and a website specifically to report adverse reactions if it neve r happens. These examples show the use of basic if-then deduct ions to arrive at opposite conclusions. Of course, this is not to say that different conclusio ns are deduced from the same premises, as that is not what is illustrated here. Rather, these quotat ions demonstrate the use of the same technique of evidence evaluation, even though the evidence it self is different. This is also how other tactics are used on opposin g sides of the debate. For example, similar uses of personal experience as a tactic are nonetheless based on different personal experiences: 162 [4.40] ha ha ha! measles, mumps had them both. it was great. I got 3 weeks off school both times and got to go bowling with mom instead o f school. Don't remember how sick I was. just being treated special and going bowlin g and no school! Bring it on! It was way better than getting Autism that's for sure! [4.44] I grew up in the fiftys too. I also contract ed all of the childhood diseases, measels, mumps, chickenpox etc. Something else happened to m e in the fiftys. My father contracted Polio during the epidemic in the early 1 950s and he DIED from it. He was a healthy, strapping, six foot tall 26 year old. He s irvived in a iron lung for 1 year before dying. Likewise, although the use of authority is common t o opposing sides of the debate, the authorities considered are very different: [5.18] here's a great study of half a million danis h, a good section were not vaccinated- generally the same rates [of autism]. [5.52] Actually, there are plenty of studies that l ink autism to vaccines. This is a link to a list of approximately 150 scientists and physicians who have serious concerns about vaccine safety. This is the reason that the same tactics can result in such different beliefs. While evidence is evaluated in the same few ways, it is not always th e same evidence that is evaluated. Hence we do not mean to argue that both conclusions are equa lly valid simply because they use the same technique. How the techniques are applied and the quality of the evidence they use makes all the difference in determining the quality of the evalua tions, but for the present study we are concerned not with how well people evaluate evidence about vaccine safety, but merely with how they evaluate it at all. On the other hand, sometimes the same evidence doe s support opposing conclusions. Consider these two quotations we have examined befo re: [5.42] Being a nurse I find this article very dist urbing. First off - the CDC would NOT administer vaccines that are harmful [5.43] I am a registered Nurse and a mom. I too be lieve that there are far more illness caused by todays shot requirements then is prevente d. 163 Note that in this case, both the technique used and the evidence are identical. That is, the technique used is an appeal to authority, specifica lly an attempt to establish one's own cognitive authority through the use of credentials. The cred entials, however, are the same, despite the opposing conclusions. Being a nurse justifies both pro-vaccination and anti-vaccination beliefs. As a salient example of the similarity of tactics on opposing sides, consider this quotation from a website in the data: [6.3] Unfortunately there are some people who are propagating vaccine misconceptions that are at odds with the science or, in other case s, making statements that are technically correct but are scientifically misleading. It is im portant to recognize these misconceptions. This quotation may appear to be pro-vaccination, bu t in fact it is from the introduction to a long post about how vaccines are unsafe. It may appear pro-vaccine because it deploys evidence evaluation tactics that are more commonly presumed to support pro-vaccination beliefs. The use of the words \"science\" and \"scientifically\" reflect an appeal to authority, in particular the authority of science. This is supplemented by an a ppeal to reason with the suggestion that opposing evidence is \"misleading.\" The same post contains language elsewhere suggesting an appeal to the authority of science, such as that va ccine safety and side effects \"have not been extensively tested in human populations\" and that \" these studies are fraught with design problems and potential bias.\" While both examples use scientific authority as a tactic for evidence evaluation, they do so in different ways. The first example calls upon science as a valid technique by calling for more extensive testing in humans. The second example rejects the validity of existing science by highlighting flawed methodology and potential bias. Thus science is framed both in positive and negative terms, depe nding on its conclusions (see also Nelson, 2010), and the use of the authority of science is n ot limited to pro-vaccine beliefs. Indeed, neither is the criticism of peer-reviewed science l imited to anti-vaccination beliefs, as allegations 164 of compromised integrity appear on opposing sides o f the debate. The integrity of Paul Offit, perhaps the leading pro-vaccine scientist, is calle d into question to support anti-vaccination beliefs: [6.4] Paul Offit is a patent holder on vaccines. Do you really trust a man who makes money on vaccines to tell the complete truth about them? But the same allegations are among the tactics used to dismiss the authority of Andrew Wakefield, the lead author of the retracted study t hat first suggested a relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism (as Nelson, 2010, has also n oted): [6.5] Wakefield accepted 50,000 pounds to be a cons ultant in an MMR litigation, which is the financial motive for his fraudulent research , as can be seen in the official ruling of the General Medical Council Again, as we have noted, certain tactics may be mor e common on one side of the debate or another, as reason and authority more commonly supp ort pro-vaccination beliefs, while emotional personal experiences more commonly suppor t anti-vaccination beliefs. Nonetheless, there seems to be no tactic identified in the prese nt data that is not employed at least to some degree in support of beliefs from opposing sides of the controversy. Looking across the quotations cited here and in pr evious chapters, we may summarize certain tropes of evidence evaluation that the two sides of the debate seem to share. Opposing sides are motivated by personal experience, either of the disease or of a loved one's reaction to a vaccine. Opposing sides accuse the other of reason ing flaws, and often the same reasoning flaws. Opposing sides cite studies that support th eir position and discredit studies that disagree, and yet opposing sides also use facts as refutation without support or citation. Opposing sides accuse each other of fearmongering, and opposing si des engage in fearmongering. Each side demands particular evidence that the other side doe s not consider valid, as when vaccine scientists are called upon to \"listen to the parent s\" or parents are called upon to accept the 165 consensus of scientists, even though scientists do not consider anecdotal evidence valid and such parents consider the scientific consensus to be com promised. Beyond accusing each other of compromised integrity, each side engages in persona l insults about the intelligence of the other side. This suggests that the use of similar tactics to r each opposite conclusions may derive from a kind of \"fight fire with fire\" approach to e vidence. In other words, tactics that convince one side may suggest to another side how to convinc e them. For example, the use of science to support pro-vaccination beliefs suggests two means of defending anti-vaccination beliefs. One is to refute opposing beliefs with different science, as often happens. The other is to reject science as a legitimate authority. This suggests the need for a replacement authority, and hence even those who reject traditional authority nonetheless seem inevitably to call upon authority in some form. This does not seem to be unique to authority . Each side summons reason to attack the reasoning of the opposition, and the prevalence of personal anecdotes to support anti-vaccination beliefs has inspired many pro-vaccination advocates to suggest more personal, emotional messaging as a counter. In the end, the similarity of tactics may derive from the desire to convince others. It is possible that this behavior may be enhanced in comments sections, which often consist of arguments. It is also likely true that such behavior is endemic to issues of controversy such as this one. Notably, implicit in the use of similar tactics on opposing sides is a critique of the idea that those tactics work in rea ching correct conclusions, since those tactics are used to reach directly contradictory conclusions. Misinformation and Belief In the foregoing analysis of beliefs about vaccine safety\u2014what is believed and how\u2014we are observing more than the formation of belief. To begin with, this is a study of a very particular 166 kind of belief in a very particular environment. I t is an environment where the consensus strongly favors one side, but in which contradictor y information is nonetheless easily available, along with a community of others seeking to reinfor ce the beliefs (on both sides.) Studies of other beliefs, such as religious belief or aestheti c belief, might offer different insights into belie f formation. In the case of vaccine safety we also f ind beliefs about misinformation, which is to say beliefs about whether something is right or wro ng. Hence a belief that vaccines are safe is also a belief that anything claiming vaccines are u nsafe is misinformation, and conversely a belief that vaccines are dangerous is also a belief that evidence of vaccine safety is misinformation. A claim that \"I have a belief abou t vaccine safety\" is also a claim that \"I know what is misinformation and what is not.\" This further suggests that while particular belief profiles resemble buffet meals, the process of their formation is more than merely a se lection of beliefs. This study, since it does not directly observe beliefs in their moment of formati on, observes something different than a choice between facts. It directly observes the justificat ion of beliefs, a stronger stance than merely the selection of them. In observing justification, thi s study observes the affirmative assertion that a belief is correct or incorrect. One selects food f rom a buffet based upon expectations about it; one does not normally defend the selection. Indeed, this idea is embodied in the very idea of belief, at least as we have defined it as treating a proposition as if it were true. One selects food with the expectation it will be delicious, but need not thereafter treat it as if it is delicious. In Internet comments, however, we observe the defense of the selection, and furthermore the modes of argument through which such defenses are made, a nd the social and rhetorical structures in which those defenses are situated. This does not i mply that Internet commenters change each other's minds, nor that believers arrange different meals with each buffet visit, as neither appears 167 to be the case. Rather, implicit in the arguments collected in the data is the assertion of something as true, in defense of some opposition th at it is not true, or vice versa. They are arguments about what is misinformation. Hence the data collected for this study seems to d epict a bidirectional relationship between misinformation and belief. On the one hand , misinformation does seem to affect belief. For example, when parents speak of their child havi ng a vaccine reaction, they seem to be saying that this event caused them to believe something. On the other hand, belief seems to affect misinformation, since bias and previous experience seem to influence how something gets designated as misinformation. Arguments that the p arents' experience misinforms them depend on a preexisting understanding of what is misinform ation. Even if this understanding, based upon scientific testing and consensus, is better in formed or somehow superior to the parents' understanding, it depends upon a determination of m isinformation. If one does not believe the scientific consensus, then one might not believe th at the parents' are misinformed. The belief affects the evaluation of misinformation. Hence it is not merely that misinformation affects what we believe, but that what we believe appears to aff ect how we understand misinformation. Again, this is not the same as saying that all inf ormation is created equal, or that misinformation depends upon one's perception of it. Rather, regardless of whether something might be empirically right or wrong, that determina tion depends upon which beliefs guide the evaluation and provide the framework in which it ca n be understood. Importantly, an understanding of belief in misinfo rmation also provides insight into how misinformation is created and how it spreads. Whil e some kinds of misinformation are created to deceive, and others are created accidentally, mu ch misinformation is believed with good intentions and best efforts. This kind of misinfor mation is not created deceptively or 168 maliciously, but by someone who believes it to be t rue, with the intention of informing others about it. This also explains the rapid spread of m uch misinformation through social media, where a person first believes the information and t hen shares it in order to inform others. Implications and Applicability The applicability of this framework to other area s of misinformation or controversy probably varies. Since risk-benefit calculations a re such a central aspect of vaccine safety considerations, the applicability will be strongest in areas where risk and benefit are important and weakest in areas where risk and benefit are les s important. For example, people probably navigate most medical controversies, such as about the value and safety of organic food and genetically-modified organisms, through means simil ar to those described here. Their personal experience with food and the kinds of scientific an d medical authorities they revere probably have a similar influence on the way they reason thr ough the risks and benefits. With other debates, however, the risk-benefit element may oper ate differently. The climate change debate, for example, relies upon a comparison between the r isks of climate change and the risks of economic regulation, so that a risk-benefit analysi s is central to that debate as well. These risks, however, may be seen as less immediately personal t han the risks of vaccines and diseases, but rather as risks to the environment and to future ge nerations. To take another example, beliefs regarding the theory of evolution may involve consi derations of the risk to one's religious beliefs, a consideration which may not be analogous to the consideration of vaccine safety. Also, for many conspiracy theorists, such as 9/11 \"truthe rs\" or holocaust deniers, the risks and benefits of holding such beliefs are much less obvious. Eve n considering Goertzel's (1994) findings that conspiracy theories are most common among those lac king power, the risk or benefit of belief in such conspiracies does not seem comparable to the r isks and benefits of vaccines. Hence for a 169 description of belief formation or of misinformed b elief generally, the centrality of risk and benefit in the present framework may need reconside ration. The other tactics of evaluation - reason, personal experience and authority - may also apply broadly but operate differently in other area s that are considered misinformation. For example, although personal experiences such as extr eme weather may influence climate change beliefs, the influence of personal experience upon reason may be weaker or different than it is with vaccine safety. Also, notably, the present fr amework does not easily account for the noted influence of political partisanship upon climate ch ange beliefs, except to the extent that political affiliation constitutes an evaluation of authority and partisan bias resembles motivated reasoning. On the other hand, both personal experience and aut hority seem essential to beliefs about evolution, given the relationship between such beli efs and religious belief. Conspiracy theories are perhaps more fundamentally considerations of au thority than anything, suggesting that a model of such beliefs might have similar elements b ut in a different relationship. What may be common across all of these areas of be lief, however, is the use of reason. Each of us imagines ourselves considering each piec e of evidence and rationally deciding what to believe or not. The reasoning may not be ration al or even reasonable, and it is often infected with other influences such as bias and emotion, but we nonetheless think of evidence evaluation as a rational, cognitive process. To the extent th at beliefs arise from evidence evaluation and evidence evaluation relies upon or purports to rely upon reason, it would seem that it underlies evaluations of vaccine safety, climate change, evol ution, conspiracy theories, etc. The influences upon that process of reason (personal experience, a uthority, or something else) and the outcome to which that reason is applied (risk, benefit, or something else) may vary across kinds of belief, but the observation of reason as a tactic for belie f formation appears broadly applicable. The 170 notable exception to this may be religious belief, where faith is often considered superior to reason, but that is a wholly different kind of beli ef than the kind examined here, which is rooted in attempts to make empirical claims about the stat e of the world. To the extent that religion seeks to make empirical claims, it roots them in re ason, and to the extent that it roots them in faith it does not, by definition, seek to make empi rical claims. For those interested in raising vaccination rates, this understanding of belief formation may have discouraging implications, as suggested by previous research that casts doubt upon the effectiveness of corrective information (Lewandowsk y et al, 2012; Nyhan & Reifler, 2010; Nyhan et al., 2014). For example, one might presum e that if only the unvaccinated and under- vaccinated understood the science, they would vacci nate fully. In the collected data, this argument repeatedly fails in the face of beliefs ab out the compromised integrity of the scientific research and the feeling that science ignores paren ts. It often is not the case that anti-vaccination beliefs are ignorant of the science, but rather tha t they reject it. A second common argument is that vaccines are a victim of their own success, an d that if people understood the effects of the diseases, vaccination rates would rise. This argum ent overlooks the belief we have characterized as a denial of the premise of vaccination, in that people often draw upon their personal experience of the disease as having been mild. Eve n when outbreaks do occur, many believers justify them as failures of the vaccine rather than as the result of under-vaccination. A third common argument, that vaccines are for the \"greater good\" and that the unvaccinated endanger others, fails for similar reasons. Many parents do not feel persuaded by the suggestion that they must risk their own child for the benefit of anyone . At the heart of the \"greater good\" argument is a belief about the premise of immunization, i.e. that it is effective and that the diseases are dangerous. For parents who believe the vaccines ar e ineffective, that the risk of the disease is 171 low, or that the risk of the vaccine is high, the g reater good argument will not persuade. The failure of each of these common arguments to increa se vaccination rates seems less surprising with an understanding of the variety of vaccine saf ety beliefs and the ways in which they appear to form. As Kahan (2010) has put it: The prevailing approach is still simply to flood th e public with as much sound data as possible on the assumption that the truth is bound, eventually, to drown out its competitors. If, however, the truth carries implica tions that threaten people's cultural values, then holding their heads underwater is like ly to harden their resistance and increase their willingness to support alternative a rguments, no matter how lacking in evidence. This reaction is substantially reinforced when, as often happens, the message is put across by public communicators who are unmistak ably associated with particular cultural outlooks or styles \u2014 the more so if such a dvocates indulge in partisan rhetoric, ridiculing opponents as corrupt or devoid of reason . This approach encourages citizens to experience scientific debates as contests between w arring cultural factions \u2014 and to pick sides accordingly.\" (p. 297) It would seem that the issue is not merely that the various sides disagree with each other, but that they fundamentally misunderstand each other. 172 Appendix A IRB Approval University of California Los Angeles 11000 Kinross Avenue, Suite 211 Los Angeles, GC-IRB: (310) 8/31/2012 STUDIES FROM: NANCY NGIRB RE: IRB#12-001170 Why do people believe misinformation?: How parents evaluate evidence about vaccine safety.
