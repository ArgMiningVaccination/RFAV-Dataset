The information below include s the minimum required number of vaccine (shots) doses children must have in order to enter /attend/transfer into a NJ licensed child care/preschool or school. Additional vaccines are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immuni zation Practices (ACIP) . The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) recommends following the ACIP schedule, as periodically revised, for optimal protection, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html . Students who are 4 months through 18 years , whose vaccinations have been delayed or who are more than one month behind, need to follow the minimum age and dose spacing intervals in accordance with the ACIP Recommended Catch -Up Schedule , http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/catchup- schedule - pr.pdf .

The child must be age- appropriately vaccinated for the grade they are entering/attending/transferring. REVISED SEPTEMBER 20 14 Diphtheria, tetanus, acellular p ertussis (DTaP ) Child Care/Preschool: Children are required to receive a minimum of four doses of a DTaP -containing vaccine or fewer as appropriate for child's age per the ACIP Recommended Schedule . The schedule below indicates the specific time these doses are due. At this age the student should have received the following vaccine: 2 months 4 months 6 months 12 months 15 months 18 months 19 months 20-59 months Diphtheria, tetanus & acellular pertussis (DTaP) Dose #1 Dose #2 Dose #3 Dose #4 Kindergarten/First Grade :* Students will nee d 4-5 doses of a DTaP -containing vaccine depending upon the age of school entry. The following two scenarios are acceptable: A total of 4 doses of a DTaP -containing vaccine with one of these 4 doses administered on or after the child's fourth birthday. OR A total of 5 doses of DTaP -containing vaccine even if all doses were administered before the fourth birthday . Children who previously attended child care/preschool should have received four doses since the requirement to receive the fourth birthday booster dose (5th dose) does not apply until the child attends Kindergarten. However, if one of these four doses was given on or after t he fourth birthday, this child will n ot need an additional dose for kindergarten. Alternatively, any 5 doses are acceptabl e. Doses of diphtheria, tetanus (DT) are only acceptable if a child has a valid medical contraindication (reason for not receiving ) the pertussis component . Second Grade and Higher (at least seven years of age) : Children who are seven years of age and ol der a re required to have a minimum of three doses of a DTaP - containing vaccine. Children seven years of age and older, who have not completed the prima ry DTaP series or have not recei ved any of the DTaP -containing vaccines , should receive three or fewer doses (as appropriate) of tetanus diphtheria ( Td) vaccine to satisfy this requirement. See the ACIP Recommended Catch -Up 2 | Page *In NJ Kindergarten is not mandatory, so some children may first enter the school system at first grade. The child must be age- appropriately vaccinated for the grade they are entering/attending/transferring. REVISED SEPTEMBER 20 14 Schedule for further guidance: http://ww w.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/catchup- schedule -pr.pdf . Please be advised that in 2010, the ACIP expanded their recommendations stating that persons aged 7 years and older who are not fully immunized with DTaP vaccine should receive Tdap vaccine preferably as the first dose in the catch -up series; if additional doses are needed, use Td vaccine. For children 7 through 10 years who receive a dose of Tdap as part of the catch -up series, an adolescent Tdap vaccine dose at age 11 through 12 years should NOT be administered. Sixth Grade and Higher : Those children born on or after January 1, 1997 AND who are at least 11 years of age and older (or a comparable age level special education program with an unassigned grade) are required to receive a one-time dose of tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis ( Tdap ) vaccine at the six grade or higher grade level . NJ regulations stipulate that at least five years must have elapsed since the last dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid containing vaccine, however, the ACIP currently recommends that Tdap can be administered regardless of the interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria -toxoid containing vaccine. Example: According to NJ regulations, if a seven -year old child steps on a rusty nail and receives a tetanus (Td) vaccine, this child will not be required to receive the Tdap vaccine until five years have elapsed. However, with the expanded ACIP recommendations, this child can receive Tdap earlier, but NJ will not require it for school attendance . Those children who have a contraindication for the pertussis component of the vaccine would not be subject to the Tdap requirement provided that they have a medical exemption. Polio (IPV ) Child Care/Preschool: Children are required to receive a minimum of three doses of a polio -containing vaccine or fewer as appropriate for child's age pe r the ACIP Recommended Schedule . The schedule below indicates the specific time these doses are due. At this age the student should have received the following vacc ine: 2 months 4 months 6 months 12 months 15 months 18 months 19 months 20-59 months Inactivated Polio Virus (IPV) Dose #1 Dose #2 Dose #3 3 | Page *In NJ Kindergarten is not mandatory, so some children may first enter the school system at first grade. The child must be age- appropriately vaccinated for the grade they are entering/attending/transferring. REVISED SEPTEMBER 20 14 Kindergarten/ First Grade : Students will need 3 -4 doses of a polio- containing vaccine depending upon the age of school entry . The following two scenarios are acceptable: A total of 3 doses of a polio vaccine with one of these 3 doses administered on or after the child's fourth birthday. OR A total of 4 doses of polio- containing vaccine even if all doses were administered before the fourth birthday. Children who previously attended child care/preschool should have received three doses since the requirement to receive the fourth birthday booster dose (4th dos e) does not apply until the child attends Kinderga rten. However, if one of these three doses was given on or after the 4th birthday, this child will not need an additional dose for Kindergarten. Alternatively, any 4 doses are acceptable. Second grade and Higher (at least seven years of age) : Children who are seven years of age and older are required to have a minimum of three doses of polio. Polio vaccine is not required for students 18 years of age and older. Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Child Car e/Preschool: Children are required to receive a minimum of one dose of MMR vaccine by 15 months of age. ACIP recommend s that MMR vaccine can be given as early as 12 months of age; however, NJDOH does not require MMR vaccine until 15 months of age for school attendance. Any dose of MMR administered prior to the first birthday is not considered a valid dose. Kindergarten -Twelfth Grade : Students are required t o receive t wo doses of measles, one dose of mumps, and one dose of rubella. Since single antigen v accines (separate components of the vaccine) are not available in the United States, most children receive two MMR vaccines. The Antibody Titer Law (Holly's Law, NJSA 26:2N -8-11), passed on January 14, 2004, requires the New Jersey Department of Health (N JDOH) to accept serologic evidence of protective immunity (protection from disease) to measles, mumps and rubella in lieu of the second ACIP recommended measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. For more information, please visit http://nj.gov/health/cd/documents/antibody_titer_law.pdf Lab Evidence: Those children enrolled in school, preschool, childcare centers who have physician diagnosed and confirmed measles, mumps, or rubella disease with laboratory evidence of immunity (protection from disease) will not be required to receive these vaccines. 4 | Page *In NJ Kindergarten is not mandatory, so some children may first enter the school system at first grade. The child must be age- appropriately vaccinated for the grade they are entering/attending/transferring. REVISED SEPTEMBER 20 14 For complete information about lab evidence/serology, please visit the \"NJ Immunization Requirements Frequently Asked Questions\" available at http://www.nj.gov/health/cd/documents/vaccine_qa.pdf Varicella (Chickenpox) Child Care /Preschool: Children are required to receive a minimum of one dose of varicella vaccine by 19 months of age ACIP recommend s that varicella vaccine can be given as early as 12 months of age; however, NJDOH does not require varicella vaccine until 19 months of age for school attendance. Kindergarten -Twelfth Grade : Students are required to receive at least one dose of varicella vaccine. Laboratory evidence of immunity, physician's written statement or a parental written statement of previous varicella diseas e is acceptable documentation of immunity (protection from disease). C hildren with this docum entation will not be required to receive varicella vaccine.

Children 12 through 59 months of age a re required to receive at least one dose of a separate or combination Hib conjugate vaccine, on or after the first birthday. The schedule below indicates the specific time these doses are due. At this age the student should have received the following vaccine: 2 months 4 months 6 months 12 months 15 months 18 months 19 months 20-59 months Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Dose #1 Dose #2 1-4 doses At least one dose given on or after the first birthday 5 | Page *In NJ Kindergarten is not mandatory, so some children may first enter the school system at first grade. The child must be age- appropriately vaccinated for the grade they are entering/attending/transferring. REVISED SEPTEMBER 20 14 If a child 's Hib vaccination was delayed, he/she may need fewer doses. One dose is required on or after the first birthday in all situations. Please see the examples below: Example #1: Children 12 through 59 months : A child 12 through 59 months of age entering child care/preschool will need to show docum entation of receiving at least one dose of Hib vaccine. If the child has a dose of Hib vaccine administered on or after the first b irthday , no further doses of Hib will be required. However, additional doses may be recommended by ACIP for optimal protection. Example #2: Children under 12 months of age: A child under 12 months of age attending child care/preschool should have at least 2 doses of Hib vaccine given b etween 2 through 11 months of age. In addition, a dose of Hib vaccine is required on or after the first birthday. NOTE: Although children 12 months of age and older are recommended to receive a Hib booster dose, c ertain combination vaccines are only approved for use in in children 15 through 18 months of age. Children receiving these combination vaccines will not be considered out of compliance until they reach 19 months of age. Kindergarten -Twelfth Grade : Hib vaccine is not routinely recommended after a student's fifth birthday and, therefore, is not a requirement for entry into kindergarten. Pneumococcal Conjugate (PCV) Child Care /Preschool: Children 2 through 11 months of age are required to receive a minimum of two age -appropriate doses of PCV, or fewer as appropriate for the child's age. Children 12 through 59 months of age ar e required to receive at least one do se of PCV , on or after the first birthday. The schedule below indicates the specific time these d oses are due. At this age the student should have received the following vaccine: 2 months 4 months 6 months 12 months 15 months 18 months 19 months 20-59 months Pneumococcal conjugate (PCV 13) Dose #1 Dose #2 1-4 doses At least one dose given on or after the first birthday 6 | Page *In NJ Kindergarten is not mandatory, so some children may first enter the school system at first grade. The child must be age- appropriately vaccinated for the grade they are entering/attending/transferring. REVISED SEPTEMBER 20 14 If a child 's PCV vaccination was delayed, he/she may need fewer doses. One dose is required on or after the first birthday in all situations. Please see the examples below: Example #1: Children 12 through 59 months : A child 12 through 59 months of age entering child care/preschool will need to show documentation of receiving at least one dose of PCV vaccine. If the child has a dose of PCV vaccine administered on or after the first birthday, no further doses of PCV will be r equired. However, additional doses may be recommended by ACIP for optimal protection. Example #2: Children under 12 months of age: A child under 12 months of age attending child care/preschool should have at least 2 doses of PCV vaccine given between 2 through 11 months of age. In addition, a dose of PCV vaccine is required on or after the first birthday. Kindergarten -Grade 12: PCV is not routinely recommended after a student's fifth birthday and, therefore, is not a requirement for entry into kinder garten. Hepatitis B Child Care/Preschool: Children are not required to receiv e hepatitis B vaccine for child care/preschool attendance. Kindergarten -Twelfth Grade : Students are required to receive three doses of hepatitis B vaccine, or any combinati on vaccine containing hepatitis B virus. There has been confusion regarding the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for children. Please note the following minimum intervals: The minimum interval between the first and second dose: Weeks after first dose - 1 month or 4 weeks or 28 days There are three minimum intervals that must be met for the third dose: Weeks after first dose - 4 months or 16 weeks or 112 days Weeks after second dose - 2 months or 8 weeks or 56 days Weeks after birth - 6 months or 24 weeks or 168 days. Alternatively, a child 11 through 15 years of age can receive a two-dose series of adult formulation hepatitis B vaccine if the vaccine is licensed for use or ACIP recommended as a two -dose regimen. Child ren who present documented laboratory evidence of hepatitis B disease or immunity (protection from disease) , constituting a medical exemption, shall not be required to receive hepatitis B vaccine. 7 | Page *In NJ Kindergarten is not mandatory, so some children may first enter the school system at first grade.

REVISED SEPTEMBER 20 14 For complete information about lab evidence/serology, pl ease visit the \"NJ Immunization Requirements Frequently Asked Questions\" available at http://www.nj.gov/health/cd/documents/vaccine_qa.pdf Meningococcal Vaccine Child Care /Preschool: Children are not required to receive a meningococcal -containing vaccine for child care/preschool attendance. Kindergarten -Twelfth Grade : Those children who were born on or after January 1, 1997 AND who are at least 11 y ears of age and older are required to receive a one -time dose of meningococcal -containing vaccine at the six grade or higher grade level (or a comparable age level special education program with an unassigned grade) . Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine is preferred. When meningococcal conju gate vaccine was licensed in January 2005, data were lacking on long -term efficacy and the need for additional vaccination. Therefore, NJDOH previously accepted doses given prior to 11 years of age without the need for revaccination. Since that time, stu dies have indicated that antibody level s decline. ACIP now recommends any meningococcal vaccination given prior to the tenth birthday (either MCV4 or MPSV4) does NOT count toward routinely recommended doses (ages 11 and older). Effective for the 2012- 2013 school year , children who received the vaccine prior to the tenth birthday will need to be revaccinated for NJ school attendance . However, there are exceptions to this rule. M eningococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended for certain children ages 2 months through 10 years. Students who travel to countries where meningococcal disease is endemic, have certain medical conditions such as complement component deficiencies and functional or anatomic asplenia (including sickle cell disease) , or who are pre sent during a meningococcal disease outbreak may have previously received meningococcal vaccine. These children may need to receive booster doses of vaccine and should consult with their physician to determine the appropriate vaccination schedule. Accord ing to the ACIP, eight weeks is the minimum interval between doses of meningococcal conjugate vaccine; however, a health care provider may de termine the most appropriate interval based on his/her clinical assessment. S uch students will satisfy the meningo coccal vaccine requirement by submitting a medical exemption written by a health care provider. Please see \"Meningococcal Vaccine Recommendations by Age and/or Risk Factor\" for further information: http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2018.pdf NJDOH is requiring that children be immunized with the four strains (A, C, Y, and W -135) that are present in the meningococcal -containing vaccines licensed for use in the United States. If any vaccines administered in foreign countries do not match the strains in US licensed vaccines, thes e vaccinations will not be accepted and will require revaccination to achieve optimal protection. 8 | Page *In NJ Kindergarten is not mandatory, so some children may first enter the school system at first grade.

REVISED SEPTEMBER 20 14 Influenza (Flu) Vaccine Child Care/Preschool: Children 6 through 59 months of age are required to receive at least one dose of influenza vaccine prior to December 31 of each year. Children who receive the seasonal flu vaccine prior to September 1 will be considered compliant as long as the vaccine is for the current flu season. Students who have not received the flu vaccine by December 31 must be excluded from school for the duration of influenza season (through March 31), until they receive at least one dose of the flu vaccine or until they turn 60 months of age (5 years old) . Valid medical and religious exemptions are acceptable. Students who have valid medical and religious exemptions are allowed to remain in school but might be excluded during disease outbreaks in consultation with public health authorities . Students e nrolled after December 31 must provide documentation that they received the current flu vaccine prior to entering school. Those children turning six months of age after December 31 must also receive the current flu vaccine. Kindergarten -Twelfth Grade : Students are not required to receive influenza vaccine for school attendance. 9 | Page *In NJ Kindergarten is not mandatory, so some children may first enter the school system at first grade.
