All rights reserved. Approximately 225,000 people are living with organ transplants in the United States. Organ transplant recip- ients (OTRs) are at increased risk for both cutaneous andsystemic malignancy. More than 1000 articles in the medicalliterature discuss cancer in the setting of organ transplanta-tion, most of which focus on skin cancer. Skin cancer is the most common human malignancy, with approximately 3.5 million skin cancers diagnosed annuallyin the United States. 1Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common type, with approximately 2.8 million basalcell carcinomas and more than 700,000 squamous cell car-cinomas (SCCs) diagnosed each year. In addition, more than68,000 malignant melanomas (MMs) are diagnosed yearly inthe United States, leading to more than 8600 deaths. 2 Transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing skin cancer compared with the general population, with anapproximately 250 times greater incidence of SCC in certainpopulations, depending on the type of transplant received. 1,3 Because skin cancers are the most common posttransplantmalignancy, the resultant morbidity and mortality in thesehigh-risk patients is quite signicant. 4This article reviews advances in managing skin cancer in these high-risk patients. Pathogenesis Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is one of the primarycausal factors in the development of NMSCs in OTRs. 5Ultra-violet B radiation induces direct DNA damage and indirectly causes DNA damage through production of reactive oxygenspecies. 6UVR also promotes the development of skin cancer through cutaneous immunosuppression.7 The immunosuppressive regimen required for graft sur- vival in OTRs may lead to an impaired immune surveillancesystem, which may influence the development of skin can-cers. Certain immunosuppressive agents may also promotemalignancy through direct carcinogenesis. 8-10Skin cancer in the setting of organ transplantation is also influenced by hu-man papillomavirus carcinogenesis, cancer susceptibility genes, and skin type. 11-14Additional risk factors for the de- velopment of skin cancer in OTRs include sun exposure his-tory and presence of actinic keratoses (AKs). 15-23The type of transplant, duration and type of immunosuppression, lowCD4 count, and older age at time of transplantation may alsobe linked to skin cancer development in these patients. 24-28 Epidemiology Skin cancer occurs in more than 44% of light-skinnedOTRs. 29Overall, these patients have an approximately 100- fold increased risk of developing NMSC compared with thegeneral population. 30Specically, there is a 65-fold increased risk of SCC, 10-fold increased risk of basal cell carcinoma(BCC), and an approximate 3.4-fold increased risk of MM. 3,10 In Queensland, Australia, in a retrospective follow-up studyof 1098 renal transplant recipients, Bouwes Bavinck et al 14 reported that the cumulative incidence of skin cancer wasapproximately 70% after 20 years of immunosuppression. Not only do skin cancers develop in OTRs, but in the setting of organ transplantation, these tumors can also be-have more aggressively, with a greater risk for local recur-*Mayo School of Graduate Medical Education, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

A retrospec-tive analysis of 100 MMs in 95 OTRs also found that patientswho had MMs with a Breslow thickness /H110222 mm had signif- icantly decreased overall survival rates than patients withBreslow thicknesses of 2 mm or less, with a hazard ratio of11.49. 34 Management Screening/Education Education about skin cancer is important for OTRs and,when done properly, can improve skin cancer-related out-comes. According to guidelines published by the Interna-tional Transplant Skin Cancer Collaborative in 2002, pa-tients should be evaluated before transplantation for factorsthat may increase their risk of skin cancer and should alsoreceive detailed education regarding sun protection, devel-opment of skin cancers, and how to perform self-examina-tions. 35In addition, OTRs should be advised of the impor- tance of frequent follow-up full skin examinations by adermatologist. Follow-up examinations should occur any-where from every 3 months to every 24 months, dependingon the patient's risk factors (Table 1). 35,36 Premalignant Lesions Both AKs and SCCs in situ (SCCIS) occur in up to 40% ofOTRs within 5 years after transplantation. 37Because AKs are evidence of early cutaneous carcinogenesis and have a pro-pensity to develop into invasive SCCs in OTRs, 38these le- sions should be treated promptly and aggressively to reducethe rate of SCC transformation. This is particularly importantin younger transplant patients with severe actinic damage. Localized destructive methods are excellent treatment op- tions for isolated AKs. These modalities include curettage with cryotherapy (Fig. 1). In patients with numerous AKs, regional eld treatments should be considered. Regional treatment options includeablative skin resurfacing via laser, dermabrasion, chemicalpeels, topical 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits thymidylate synthetase, thus blocking DNA synthesis. Topi-Table 1 Guidelines for Recommended Follow-Up Intervals by Risk Factors Risk Factors Follow-Up Only risk factor is immunosuppression Every 12-24 mo Risk factors, such as sun exposure or fair skin, but no history of AK or NMSC Every 6-12 mo Early cutaneous carcinogenesis, ie, AKs or or carcinogenesis, ie, >10 NMSCs/yr, cancer; SCC, squamous cell carcinoma. Figure 1 Guidelines for management of AKs in organ transplant recipients. C&C, curettage in the treatment of prema- lignant cutaneous lesions, with cure rates of up to 98%.39 Topical 5-fluorouracil is even more effective under occlusionand is benecial in treating extensive AKs in OTRs, especiallyon the lower extremities. One technique involves weeklychemowraps using topical 5-fluorouracil under occlusionwith Unna boot wraps for 4-20 weeks (Fig. 2). 40 Imiquimod is an immune-modulating agent that has proven effective in treating AKs as well. Randomized con-trolled studies have demonstrated its efcacy in transplantpatients, with clearance rates of up to 62% compared withvehicle alone. 41In a study of renal transplant recipients, 7 of 14 patients showed reduced skin atypia after topical imi- quimod, 5% cream was applied 3 times weekly for 16 weeks.Adverse reactions primarily included local irritation. 42 Topical PDT is another excellent way to treat large areas of precancerous changes in OTRs. PDT is a process that usesaminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate as photosen-sitizing agents, produce reactive oxygen species that selec-tively target proliferating cells after their activation by expo-sure to light. A recent study demonstrated that PDT offers acomplete response rate of 71% for AKs in OTRs. 43 Oral retinoids have been shown to inhibit tumor prolifer- ation and differentiation in vivo and can reduce the numberof keratotic lesions by 45%. 44,45A recent systematic review suggested systemic retinoids, consider- ations should be taken into account when deciding which oral retinoid to prescribe. Acitretin and isotretinoin can bothbe effective as chemopreventive agents. Unlike acitretin, isot-retinoin has not been studied specically in OTRs but used in 47Because isotretinoin has a half-life than acitretin, it is the preferred choice inwomen of childbearing age. However, because of the iPledgeprogram, isotretinoin is more cumbersome to prescribe. Isot-retinoin may have more mucocutaneous and rheumatologicadverse effects than acitretin, and the dose is determinedaccording to the patient's weight. Isotretinoin can be given atdoses of 2 mg/kg per d; however, this is considered a highdose associated with many adverse effects. Low-dose isotreti-noin may not be very effective in preventing certain forms ofskin cancer, especially BCC. 48,49 Some clinicians advocate starting at low doses of acitretin and increasing the dose while monitoring for adverse effects.The dosage of acitretin, however, can be initiated at 0.4mg/kg per d. 50Common adverse effects are headache, rash, and hyperlipidemia, in addition to the rebound phenomenonof development of multiple eruptive SCCs after cessation ofacitretin. 51 Management of BCCs in OTRs Table 2 summarizes the management approaches to treat- ment of low- and high-risk BCCs in OTRs.

Table 2 Management Approaches to tion; OTR, organ management in organ transplant recipients 37Low-Risk BCCs Cryotherapy is a method of localized destruction of tissueusing liquid nitrogen to induce cellular injury through intra-and extracellular ice crystal formation. The success of thisprocedure depends on tumor selection, speed and durationof cooling, thaw time, and the number of freeze-thaw cycles.The goal is to achieve a temperature of -50\u00b0C to - 60\u00b0C at thebase of the tumor with at least 3-mm margins and a freezetime of approximately 40-90 seconds. 52This method has been described in the treatment of BCCs in immunocompe-tent patients. One study of 415 BCCs demonstrated a curerate of 99.0% over 5 years. 52Cryotherapy as a single modality has not been explored after transplantation. When ED&C is performed, the surgeon destroys the can- cerous lesion with electrocauterization and then scrapes thearea with a sharp curette, a process generally repeated 2 or 3times. This modality remains a popular treatment option inpatients after transplantation because it can be used to treatmultiple supercial cancerous lesions with cure rates dem-onstrated to be greater than 90% in immunocompetenthosts. 53 Surgery is one of the modalities used most frequently to treat BCCs. Current guidelines for surgical excision of low-risk BCCs recommend at least a 4-mm margin. This has beenshown to provide a 5-year cure rate of 90%-98% in the gen-eral population 54and approximately 90% in the OTR popu- lation.55 Among immunocompetent individuals, imiquimod demonstrated BCCs and65% for nodular BCCs. 56In 5 renal transplant patients, the use of topical imiquimod fully cleared only 40% of BCCs,demonstrating its greatest efcacy among patients with su-percial BCCs. 57In 1 survey, 4 of 25 dermatologists in the United States reported using imiquimod to treat supercialBCCs in OTRs. 58The use of imiquimod is limited by adverse effects, cost, lower clearance rates, and whether the patientfollows the prescribed treatment. Interferon acts as both an antiproliferative agent and an immunomodulator. Its use has been investigated in chemo-prophylaxis and treatment of premalignant lesions and skincancers. Studies in which the authors used intralesional in-terferon injections for low-risk BCCs have demonstrated curerates of up to 96%. 59In patients with high-risk features, such as morpheaform subtypes or clinical recurrence, only 27% ofthose receiving interferon did not show any residual tumor. 60 Topical PDT also has been used to treat BCCs. To optimize this treatment modality, lesions should be carefully selectedas complete response rates are only approximately 62%, witha 33% response rate for nodular lesions, on the extremities demonstrated worse outcomes.Therefore, supercial BCCs on the trunk would be best fortreatment with PDT. High-Risk BCCs Factors that lead to categorization of BCCs as high risk arelisted in Table 3. BCCs at high risk for recurrence should betreated aggressively, particularly in OTRs. Mohs micro-graphic surgery (MMS) offers the highest cure rates forNMSCs, with cure rates as high as 99% for BCC. 61,62When available, MMS should be the primary surgical treatment forBCCs located on the head and neck of OTRs. If a patient cannot tolerate surgery, needs extensive sur- gery, or has an inoperable tumor, denitive radiation therapymay be an option. One study reported a cure rate of 95% inprimary BCCs and an 86% cure rate for recurrent BCCs. 63 This modality should not be the primary option, particularlyin OTRs, because radiation therapy may predispose the irra-diated sites to the development of future NMSCs. Clinical trials are underway to study a novel molecule in the treatment of advanced or metastatic BCC. GDC-0449 is asmoothened (SMO) protein inhibitor of the hedgehog path-way (implicated in the pathogenesis of BCCs). A phase 1multicenter trial has demonstrated good responses with thisagent in the treatment of metastatic BCCs. 64 Management of SCCs in OTRs SCCs in OTRs may show high-risk features, such as increasedthickness, dermal invasion, and acantholysis, more fre-quently than in immunocompetent patients. 65Furthermore, immunosuppressed patients with SCC are more than 4 timesmore likely to have local recurrence and metastasis than pa-tients who are immunocompetent. 66SCCs should therefore be treated promptly and aggressively, preferably with surgi-cal modalities when appropriate. All lesions clinically suspicious for SCC should be biop- sied. Selection of appropriate therapy is made by evaluationof clinical and histologic features, the presence of lymphade-nopathy, evidence of metastasis, and the patient's co-morbidconditions. Classication of a patient's SCC as low or highrisk is essential for proper management. The clinical andhistologic risk factors for local recurrence and metastasis aresummarized in Table 4. 65Table 5 summarizes treatment mo- dalities for SCCs in OTRs and Fig. 3 outlines a treatment algorithm.Table 3 Clinical and Histologic Risk Factors for Local Recur- rence and Metastasis of BCC Low-Risk Features of BCCsHigh-Risk Features of BCCs Clinical features Clinical features Slow growth Rapid growth Low-risk location, such as extremityHigh-risk site, such as mid face Small lesion (<2-cm diameter)Large size (>2-cm diameter) Well-dened borders Poorly dened and topical regimens, such as 5-fluorouraciland imiquimod. Excellent cure rates have been reported with cryotherapy for treatment of properly selected supercial SCCs. 52,67Ad- vantages of cryotherapy include good cure rates, acceptablecosmesis, low morbidity, low cost, and ability to treat multi-ple lesions at the same time. One major disadvantage of cryo-therapy is the highly user-dependent nature of therapeuticsuccess. In low-risk ED&C rates of of ED&C include low cost and effec- tiveness. It is important to note, however, that excisionalsurgery may be a better option for small tumors in hair-bearing areas because tumor cells extending down follicularstructures may not be completely eradicated with ED&C. Topical therapies may be considered in patients who are not good candidates for the above-mentioned treatments orwho have a considerable tumor burden. A systematic reviewfound clearance rates of 73% to 88% in SCCIS of topical imiquimod, 5% cream. Thesame study reported clearance rates of 27% to 85% for SCCISwith use of topical 5-fluorouracil 69; however, OTRs were not included in this study population. Thus, because of the riskof progression and increased aggressiveness of NMSCs inOTRs, the ablative therapies discussed previously are moreoften recommended, largely because of their greater efcacyin completely treating small low-risk tumors.The workhorse for treating skin cancer in OTRs is surgery. Surgical excision of low-risk SCCs with 4-6-mm marginsoffers a 95% cure rate. 70This technique provides histologic evaluation of tumor margins and rapid healing with oftenfavorable cosmesis. Surgical excision has similar cure rates toED&C 71; therefore, potential disadvantages compared with ED&C include a greater risk of complications, such as hema-toma and wound dehiscence, increased cost, and increasedprocedure time in patients with multiple low-risk SCCs. High-Risk SCCs Excisional surgery is recommended for high-risk undercertain circumstances, specically when MMS is unavailable.For high-risk SCCs, a 6-mm to 1-cm margin is recommendedand cure rates may reach 95%. 70Prophylactic irradiation of the surgical site as an adjunctive modality may be consideredin aggressive, high-risk tumors after surgical excision. MMS offers the advantage of complete margin visualiza- tion and tissue conservation, with cure rates ranging from96% to 97% in primary SCCs and 90% to 94% in recurrentSCCs. 71It sometimes happens that an SCC that is clinically small may in fact exhibit perineural invasion or other aggres-sive histopathologic features, such that a large nal defect isultimately required to clear the cancer (Fig. 4). Completemargin control is particularly important in OTRs because oftheir increased risk of developing subclinical tumor exten-sion and spread. MMS should therefore be the surgical mo-dality of choice for the management of high-risk SCC inOTRs. If an OTR is not a surgical candidate, radiation therapy may be considered for the treatment of high-risk NMSCs.Table 4 Clinical and Histologic Risk Factors for Local Recurrence and Metastasis in SCCs Low-Risk Features of SCCs High-Risk Features of SCCs Clinical features Clinical features Primary tumor Recurrent lesion Well-dened borders Poorly dened borders Diameter <2 cm on the trunk and extremities Diameter >2 cm on the trunk and extremities Diameter <1 cm on the cheeks, forehead, neck, and scalpDiameter >1 cm on cheeks, forehead, neck, and scalp Diameter <0.6 cm on the \"mask areas\" of the face, genitalia, hands, and feetDiameter >0.6 cm on the \"mask areas\" of the face, genitalia, hands, and feet Slow growth Rapid growth Lack of neurologic symptoms Neurologic symptoms Ulceration Lesion within scar, chronic inflammation, or previous radiation therapy Satellite lesionsImmunocompromised patient Histologic features Histologic features Depth<4 mm situ or keratoacanthoma type Acantholysis Well-differentiated histology Moderate or poor differentiation Restriction to papillary dermis Extension into deeper dermis/subcutaneous fat No evidence of or vascular invasion Perineural or vascular invasion SCC, from Kovach BT and Stasko T: Squamous cell carcinoma in organ transplant recipients, in Otley CC, Stasko T (eds): Skin Disease in Organ Cambridge University Press; 2008, pp 172-181.Used with permission.Skin cancer management in organ transplant recipients 39Radiation therapy can be extremely effective for properly selected tumors, taking into account the facts that tumorcontrol and cosmesis tend to be related to lesion size and thatradiation is less effective in recurrent lesions. In general,smaller primary lesions and BCCs have better outcomes withradiation as monotherapy than larger tumors or SCCs. 63 Adjuvant postsurgical radiation therapy may be an option for incompletely excised tumors as well as aggressive high-Table 5 Treatment Options for SCCs in OTRs Treatment Pros Cons Topical regimens 5-Fluorouracil cream Field treatment for low-risk SCCs Not as imiquimod; signicant low-risk cosmesisLocal irritation; depends on good for invasiveSCC Supercial ablative techniques Low cost, rapid, can treat lesionsPain, scarring, blistering; less margin control; no eld control;only for in situ and minimallyinvasive SCC Photodynamic therapy Effective eld treatment, 1-3 sessions, rapid recovery, can treat multiplelesionsPain during session, need to avoid sun exposure for 48 hafter treatment, only good forsupercial tumors ED&C or C&C Highly effective on properly selected low-risk SCCsLess margin control; less favorable cosmesis; not goodfor high-risk SCC Surgical excision Excision with postoperative evaluation of marginsSome margin control; can remove larger tumorsMore prone to incomplete excision; higher recurrencerates Mohs micrographic surgery Treatment of margin control; tissuesparingHigh cost; difcult with multiple tumors; for specialist Radiotherapy Option with incompletely excised tumors and higher-risk SCCs; may decreasetumor burden and risk of metastasesRecurrences in radiation eld may be difcult to treat; risk ofradiation dermatitis andradiation-inducedcarcinogenesis Chemoradiotherapy Better cure rates than therapy aloneStill mostly investigational; severe toxic effects Nonsurgical denitive therapies Radiation therapy Good option for inoperable tumors, poor surgical candidates, in-transitmetastasesNo margin control; recurrences in radiation eld may be difcultto treat; risk of radiationdermatitis and radiation-induced carcinogenesis Sentinel lymph node dissection May help stage patients with previously undiagnosed metastatic diseaseUnclear survival benet; morbidity from surgery Systemic treatments Oral retinoids May decrease tumor burden in advanced SCCsSerious adverse effects; rebound phenomenon Chemotherapy Option for inoperable tumors Limited experience C&C, curettage with cryotherapy; Adapted from Kovach BT and Stasko T: Squamous cell carcinoma in organ transplant recipients, in Otley CC, Stasko T (eds): Skin Disease in Organ University Press; tumors a recurrence rate of 33% to 50% in OTRs, and additional treatment istherefore essential. 72The goal of adjuvant radiation therapy is to treat any residual tumor and to prevent recurrence. Adjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy are treat- ment modalities used after surgical excision or MMS, partic-ularly for high-risk lesions, patients with positive lymphnodes, or SCCs with vascular or perineural involvement. Sev-eral authors demonstrated a decreased risk of recur- rence and metastasis as well as increased survival for patientswith head and neck SCC when postsurgical adjuvant chemo-therapy and chemoradiotherapy were used rather than adju-vant radiation alone. However, the utility of adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy is still being investigated, and it is unclearwhether these treatments will be benecial in OTRs. Particularly in unresectable lesions, newer nonsurgical in- terventions are being investigated. The epidermal growth fac-tor receptor (EGFR) gene has been found to be overexpressedin SCCs of the head and neck. 77Several agents have been developed that block the EGFR, including getinib and erlo-tinib, as well as agents that act as anti-EGFR monoclonalantibodies, such as cetuximab and panitumumab. Recently,recommendations were made by the Head and Neck CancerDisease Site Group regarding the use of EGFR-targeted ther-apy in stage III and IV head and neck cancers. 78The consen- sus was that platinum-based chemoradiation should remain the treatment of choice for locally advanced tumors. How-ever, in patients who are over the age of 70 years or withlocally advanced tumors who cannot medically tolerate che-motherapy, radiotherapy plus cetuximab is recommended to improve overall survival. Furthermore, although OTRs are at increased risk of de- veloping recurrence or metastasis, there is still no consensuson the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy to aid in the eval-uation and staging of a patient with possible subclinical me-tastasis to the local lymph node basins. The authors of onestudy found that SCCs near the parotid gland had the highestrisk of metastases, especially SCCs that were more than 4 mmthick. The risk of occult nodal disease has been reported as20%-40% in adjacent nodal regions, making sentinel lymphnode biopsy an attractive option to help stage properly se-lected high risk patients. 79For patients with aggressive forms of SCC near the parotid gland, a parotidectomy with lymphnode dissection may be considered to prophylactically de-crease the risk of metastases. Management of Multiple NMSCs in OTRs Once multiple NMSCs or isolated high-risk SCCs begin todevelop in an OTR, prophylactic treatment and reduction inimmunosuppression should be considered. Systemic agentsused for prophylactic chemoprevention and recommenda-tions for reduction in immunosuppression will be discussedhere; however, ablative resurfacing techniques, such as CO 2 laser, dermabrasion, or chemical peels, may also be consid-ered in areas with a considerable tumor burden primarilyconsisting of small or supercial NMSC. Most of the agents described are investigational but may offer options for chemoprophylaxis or adjuvant therapy in Figure 3 Guidelines for management of SCCs in organ transplant recipients.

Oral retinoids, as dis- cussed previously, may be an option for chemoprophylaxis,with a recent review suggesting that acitretin may decreasethe incidence of NMSCs in OTRs. 46Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil. It has been approved by the U.S.Food and Drug Administration for treatment of breast andcolorectal cancer. Capecitabine has also demonstrated nota-ble improvements in NMSC in the setting of organ transplan-tation. 80 Resiquimod is a Toll-like receptor 7 and 8 agonist. The mechanism of action in resiquimod is similar to that of imi-quimod; however, resiquimod is about 10-100 times more potent, with clearance rates of AKs reported from 77% to90%. 81 Reduction in immunosuppression is an additional man- agement option when deemed safe. Reducing immunosup-pressive medications should be considered in patients withconsiderable tumor burden and high-risk skin cancers. De-creasing immunosuppression may place these patients at in-creased risk of graft rejection. Thus, a consensus on a safelevel of immunosuppression for the NMSC tumor burden hasbeen recently developed. 82Dose reduction was stratied into mild, moderate, and severe by risk of permanent allograftfunction and death. With one NMSC, mild reduction in im-munosuppression should be considered in both kidney andliver transplant recipients. With 2 or more NMSCs, a de-crease in immunosuppression should be considered in heartallograft patients. The consensus group also recommendedmoderate reduction in immunosuppression in kidney andliver allograft recipients once these patients begin experienc-ing more than 25 NMSCs per year or high-risk skin cancers,such as high-risk SCC, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), orstage II or greater MM. Severe reduction in immunosuppres-sion is recommended only in patients with skin cancers known to have mortality of approximately 90% over 3 years,including untreatable metastatic SCC, stage IV MM, or met-astatic MCC. 82 In addition, several investigators have shown that the use of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors for immuno-suppression, as opposed to calcineurin inhibitors, may re-duce the risk of malignancy associated with immunosuppres-sion in OTRs. 83-85MTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus and everolimus, have a negative growth effect on cancer cells.84,85 In addition, therapy with sirolimus alone or sirolimus main-tenance after cyclosporine withdrawal has shown lower ratesof malignancy 2 years after renal transplantation and shouldbe considered in OTRs in whom skin cancer begins to de-velop. 82 Management of MM Several clinical scenarios are considered in the treatment ofMM in OTRs. These include (1) a personal history of MMbefore transplantation, (2) donor transmission of MM, and(3) posttransplant development of MM. In general, patientsfound to have numerous dysplastic nevi on pretransplantexamination should be followed closely, with a low thresholdfor biopsy. Patients with a history of a dysplastic nevus or MMin situ are considered low risk for metastasis and should notbe prevented from receiving a transplant by this informationalone. 86 Patients with supercial spreading melanomas with a Breslow thickness of /H110211 mm are counseled to wait 2 years from diagnosis before receiving a transplant. Transplant can-didates with thicker melanomas and negative lymph nodeinvolvement must wait 5 years from diagnosis until trans-plant. In general, patients with lymph node involvement ormetastasis are not considered good candidates for organtransplants. 87 Figure 4 (A) Renal transplant recipient with inltrating basal cell carcinoma. (B) Post-Mohs micrographic surgery M.K. Singh and J.D. BrewerTreatment recommendations for OTRs found to have de novo MM after organ transplantation are based on guidelines for the immunocompetent population (Fig. 5). Althoughlarge population-based studies are lacking, poorer outcomeshave been reported in the recent literature in OTRs in whomMM develops. 34Therefore, in addition to standard recom- mendations for wide local excision, consideration of a senti-nel lymph node biopsy, particularly in MM with a Breslowthickness of 0.75-1.0 mm, is more frequently warranted. Ad-juvant chemotherapy and more frequent follow-up examina-tions with a low threshold for biopsy may also be consideredfor OTRs in whom MM subsequently develops. Special Scenarios Perineural InvasionPerineural invasion is a particularly worrisome feature,linked to an increased risk of metastasis (Fig. 6). 71SCCs with perineural invasion should be treated with MMS when it isavailable. 71,88Deep, aggressive SCCs with perineural inva- gland may be candidates for parotidec-tomy and neck dissection in addition to MMS. Finally,aggressive SCCs with perineural invasion warrant consider-ation of postoperative radiation, even when they have alreadybeen completely treated with MMS. 89 Metastatic SCCOTRs with metastatic SCC are generally assessed on an indi-vidual basis. In general, however, these patients should beconsidered candidates for adjuvant postoperative radiationtherapy, retinoid decreased immunosuppression. above, capecitabine may be a systemic chemotherapy optionfor these patients. In addition, in patients with recurrent ormetastatic head and neck SCCs, cetuximab plus platinum-based chemotherapy showed improved response rates, aswell as better overall and progression-free survival. 78 In-Transit MetastasesDermal or satellite metastases can occur with all the commonforms of skin cancer but are seen most often with SCC, MCC,and MM, clinically presenting as growing subcutaneous nod-ules adjacent to previously treated sites. These in-transit me-tastases are most commonly diagnosed on the forehead andscalp and are seen more frequently in OTRs than in nontrans-plant patients. Disease-specic mortality at 24 months hasbeen shown to be 33% in OTRs with in-transit metastases. Thus, OTRs with in-transit metastases should be treated withaggressive surgery when containment of the tumor is consid-ered possible, in addition to adjuvant radiation therapy andsystemic chemotherapy. Metastases to Regional Lymph Nodes With metastatic head and neck SCCs, prolongation of sur-vival and palliation are the main treatment goals because 50%of untreated patients survive only 4 months. 91SCCs demon- strating in-transit metastasis and positive lymph node in-volvement should be treated with a combination of lymphnode dissection and adjuvant radiation therapy, chemother-apy, or both. Adjuvant radiation therapy can be used to decrease local nodal recurrence in most cases. In a retrospective study ofpatients with metastatic head and neck SCC, patients under-going surgery plus adjuvant radiation therapy had a lowerrecurrence rate (20% vs 43%) and an improved 5-year dis- Figure 5 Guidelines for management of MMs in organ transplant recipients. MMIS indicates malignant melanoma in situ.Skin cancer management in organ transplant recipients 43ease-free survival rate (73% vs 54%; P/H110050.004) compared with those who had surgery alone.92One study SCC in OTRs specically sur- vival at 1 year as 39% in patients with distant or systemicmetastases and 89% in OTRs with in-transit or regional nodalmetastases, with a mean time from primary to metastatictumor of 17 months. The overall 3-year disease-specic sur-vival was 56%. 32 Historically, chemotherapy in the setting of metastatic skin cancer has been used mostly for palliation. Palliative chemo-therapy tends to improve quality of life temporarily, with 1study demonstrating an extension of 10 weeks of life whencisplatin was used. 93 Induction chemotherapy is used before denitive surgery or radiation therapy to decrease the initial tumor size, to treatsubclinical metastases, or both. Because there are conflictingdata regarding the efcacy of these regimens in reducingmetastases and survival, with some investigators failing todemonstrate improvement in these outcomes, 73,94-97this mo- dality is now used mainly with concurrent chemoradiother-apy along with combinations of 5-fluorouracil and platinum-based chemotherapy to reduce rates of distant metastaticrecurrences. It has been suggested that in OTRs with cutane-ous SCCs involving the facial nerve, induction chemoradio-therapy may be used to avoid facial nerve resection. 98 Denitive chemoradiotherapy is an alternative treatment modality in patients for whom surgery is not an option. Thiscombination regimen is thought to control regional and sys-temic metastases with the synergistic benets of tumor radio-sensitization and chemotherapy. 99In a meta-analysis of 63 randomized controlled studies, a 4% increased survival at 5years was demonstrated with the addition of chemotherapy;however, survival increased 8% at 5 years when chemoradio-therapy was compared directly with radiotherapy alone. 96 More recently, numerous studies in which the authors usedeither combination chemotherapy or monotherapy with var-ious radiation therapy regimens have demonstrated that con-current chemoradiotherapy is superior to radiation therapyalone in unresectable head and neck tumors. 100-103Guide- lines for the ideal chemoradiotherapy regimen have not yetbeen determined. Patient selection is important given theincreased toxicities, such as mucositis and weight loss. 104 Therefore, this modality should be used in OTRs with ad-vanced or metastatic if the benets outweigh po-tential toxicities. Extensive Scalp Disease Many older male OTRs may exhibit extensive actinic damageof the scalp, which may be more difcult to treat secondary tofollicular extension. In addition, eld involvement may fur-ther enhance the difculty of treating subclinical disease. Alow threshold for biopsy of lesions suspicious for invasiveSCC and aggressive treatment of actinic damage are necessaryto decrease local disease and prevent SCC development andprogression. Repetitive treatment with topical 5-fluorouracilfor extensive actinic damage is recommended. In addition,wide excision and closure with skin grafting are recom-mended to control local disease and aid in easier observationfor possible recurrence in patients with multiple carcinomason the scalp. Actinic Cheilitis and SCC of the Lip In situ and invasive SCC of the lip tends to be more aggressivethan SCC on other glabrous skin sites. In addition, OTRs are20 times more likely to develop lip SCC compared with thegeneral population. 10Because actinic cheilitis, the precursor to lip SCC, is generally diffuse in OTRs, complete vermil-ionectomy, whether excisional or with CO 2laser, may be used to eradicate the premalignant damage,105whereas any invasive component should be treated with MMS.

BrewerConclusions Because OTRs are at increased risk for aggressive skin cancers associated with worse outcomes, early and aggressive treat-ment of patients exhibiting signs of cutaneous carcinogenesisis necessary. UVR is the most controllable risk factor for skincancers in OTRs, and education regarding sun protection hasproven benecial in these patients. Skin self-examinationsand regular follow-up examinations with a dermatologist arealso important in OTRs. Generally, treatment is determined for each patient by risk factors, individual patient characteristics, and tumor burden.In addition to traditional treatments, such as cryotherapy,ED&C, surgical excision, and MMS, other treatment modal- ities can be used to treat skin cancer in OTRs. Patients withconsiderable tumor burden may benet from prophylacticregimens as well as a reduction in immunosuppression. Amultidisciplinary, team-based approach with specialists inthe areas of otorhinolaryngology, der-matology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and hema-tology is ideal when treating this unique group of patients.Through education and management, dermatologists canplay an important role in the overall health and outcomesthese patients experience because of skin cancer.
