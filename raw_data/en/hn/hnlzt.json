It focuses on the oral transmission of knowledge, diversity of practice and the spiritual dimension of health. Rongo Mori encompasses herbal remedies, physical therapies and spiritual healing. Tohunga is the discipline of traditional healing and its practitioners. In early Mori history Tohunga were seen as the earthly medium of the controlling spirits and influenced all aspects of life. Illness was viewed as a symptom of disharmony with nature. If a person was sick, the Tohunga would first determine what imbalance had occurred, before the illness could then be treated both spiritually and physically. When European settlers came to New Zealand, they brought with them new diseases, modifying the environment and changing the disease ecology of the country. This caused significant mortality among Mori from influenza, measles, whooping cough and dysentery. The Mori population continued to decline into the early 1900s until the situation was reversed partly due to health reforms including building latrines, destroying unsanitary dwellings and establishing Mori health nurses. The Tohunga Suppression Act 1907 grew out of concern of the practice of \"rogue\" Tohunga who lacked the training and integrity of traditional Tohunga. Rongo Mori was seen as unsafe and an impediment to Mori progress by the medical fraternity. A conventional western medical system was desired for New Zealand. At this time, the activity of \"quack\" doctors was also suppressed with the Quackery Prevention Act 1908. The Tohunga Suppression Act was passed with support from the four Mori members of Parliament, but only Tohunga whose activities were seen as harmful, were suppressed. The legislation was never really enforced with very few Tohunga prosecuted. However the main consequence of the Act was that it pushed the practice of Rongo Mori underground. Identities of Tohunga were kept secret and matters of Rongo were never discussed outside of Mori communities. Rongo Mori today Despite the Suppression Act, training of Tohunga continued over the years and knowledge was passed on and developed. In 1962, as a result of a review of legislation that differentiated between Mori and Europeans, the Tohunga Suppression Act was repealed. With the resurgence of Mori culture in the past few decades Rongo Mori has once again become prominent. Mori view health in a holistic way, incorporating spiritual, psychological, physical and family aspects. It is perceived that conventional health services are focused on treating a person's physical health but may not always address other aspects. Some Mori may feel that their needs are better met by engaging with their traditional healers. There may also be geographical, financial or cultural barriers to accessing mainstream healthcare for some people. The World Health Organisation advocates the inclusion of traditional healers in national health systems. There is a call for Rongo Mori to be formalised within the public health system in New Zealand and to exist in synergy with conventional medical systems. The following steps have been made to this effect: - In 1993 the National Organisation of Mori Traditional Practitioners (Ng Ringa Whakahaere O te Iwi Mori) was established. - In 1995 regional health authorities were able to purchase aspects of Rongo Mori. The Ministry of Health has continued to fund services. - In 1999 the Ministry of Health published a set of standards for traditional Mori healing. - In 2006 the Ministry of Health released a Rongo development plan outlining how Mori traditional healing practices will be supported within the health and disability sector. The aims of this plan are to improve the quality of Rongo services, create leadership roles within Rongo, increase the capacity and capability of services and develop research and evaluation activities. - In 2007 Lake Taupo PHO signed a contract for services with the National Organisation of Traditional Healers, setting a benchmark for bridging the divide between Mori and mainstream services. The two organisations now work together to promote the benefits of Rongo Mori. The practice of Rongo Mori Rongo is an important aspect of health care to many Mori people despite their concurrent use of western medicine. It represents the passing on of culture and history. Traditional treatment may be sought for a variety of reasons including illness that is atypical or not responding to conventional treatment, mental illness and chronic \"lifestyle\" conditions such as type II diabetes. Tohunga do not have a specific training programme or institution but are recognised experts in their field by their communities. Many learn their craft through the passing on of knowledge from elders or through apprenticeships with practising Tohunga. Knowledge and practice borrowed from western medicine may be incorporated into treatment. Tohunga may work alone or within a clinic (Whare Oranga) and generally do not actively advertise for patients. There is considerable variation in practice and treatment protocols and no standard consensus on diagnosis or prescription. Treatment is individualised to tribes, areas, local plant material and specific needs. Healers are thought to be more prevalent in rural areas and in the North Island. Treatment includes plant remedies from native flora (Rongo rkau), massage (mirimiri) and prayer (karakia). Illness is treated by addressing aspects of health including spiritual, psychological, emotional, cultural, social, environmental, family and physical health. As part of the Ministry of Health standards for traditional healing, Tohunga must ensure that: - Patients are aware of any follow-up treatment or consultation required - Patients are referred to other services where appropriate, especially for emergency or acute needs - Co-operation with other health professionals according to the wishes or needs of the patient takes place Whare Oranga, like general practices, are required to keep records for patients they treat. These records must contain details of treatment objectives and outcomes. Some Mori patients may be unwilling to admit to their doctor that they are using traditional healing methods. However GPs should feel comfortable asking their patients about Rongo Mori. As for any patient, it is important to be aware of any alternative remedies that a patient is taking, to assess any possible conflict with conventional medicine or treatment. Plant remedies - Rongo rkau Plant remedies (Rongo rkau) form an integral part of Rongo Mori. Numerous native plants are used to treat a variety of conditions including colds, flu, gastrointestinal problems, genitourinary problems, aches and pains. Plants must be carefully prepared as some species are toxic if not used correctly. Some of the more common plants used in Rongo Mori are listed in Table 1. The use of plant remedies does not require regulatory approval as long as they do not contain a scheduled medicine. However, as some pharmaceuticals are derived from plants, it is possible that Rongo may contain active ingredients. As long as these pharmaceuticals are not purposely added to a remedy no restrictions apply to the use of such plants. Note that some plants, for example St Johns wort, can interact with conventional medicines. - Appropriate tikanga (customs and rites) must be observed during the collection, preparation and storage of Rongo. - Plant material must be correctly identified, gathered from non-polluted areas and prepared safely and hygienically. - Plants are usually crushed or dried and mixed with water or ethyl alcohol. - Plant remedies should only be prescribed and dispensed by Tohunga to individual patients. Tohunga will advise on appropriate use. - Plant remedies should not be labelled with therapeutic claims. Labels should contain the ingredient(s), instructions for use, date of preparation, expiry date and who the remedy is prescribed for.
