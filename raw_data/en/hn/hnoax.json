As the first comprehensive evaluation and rehabilitation center focused on balance disorders in Southern Arizona, the Balance Center can help improve your ability to function in daily life. Help for Balance Disorders Our team of specially trained audiologists, physical therapists and referring doctors collaboratively evaluate and treat disorders that affect balance. We apply clinically proven techniques supported by state-of-the-art technology and research to treat individuals with: - Vertigo - Dizziness - Disequilibrium - Balance dysfunction - History of frequent falls Evaluation Services The first step in finding the right treatment for your balance problems is finding the cause of your symptoms. The Balance Center's team of specialists uses advanced technology to perform tests that will help to pinpoint the nature of your balance problem. Tests performed at the Center include: Computerized Dynamic Posturography Platform testing is used to assess the functional interactions of vision, movement and the inner ear balance system (vestibular system). Video/Electro Nystagmography (VNG/ENG) Eye movements in response to visual targets and stimulation of the inner ear system are documented to obtain information about the peripheral and central vestibular systems as well as the brain's control of eye motion (oculomotor system). Audiometry, Immittance and Acoustic Testing Reflex testing evaluations are performed to assess the ear and hearing mechanisms. The magnitude and nature of a hearing loss can be determined. Middle ear function and the status of the facial and hearing nerves are assessed. Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential and Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response Evaluations Tests are performed to assess the integrity of the neural pathways associated with hearing and balance. Physical Therapy Evaluations The physical systems required to maintain balance and mobility are assessed in depth by specially trained physical therapists. Treatment Designed for You Armed with information from the evaluation, our clinical team creates a vestibular rehabilitation plan tailored to your or your loved one's individual needs. Rehabilitation may include exercises and activities to decrease vertigo, repositioning maneuvers and exercises for positional and balance retraining. Based on the nature of the balance disorder, the rehabilitation program will be designed to: - Resolve or decrease the frequency, intensity and duration of vertigo - Improve overall balance, prevent or reduce falls - Develop ways of coping with dizziness, disequilibrium and anxiety Get Started Don't let balance problems interfere with your life.
