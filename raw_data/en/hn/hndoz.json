I first started seeing her about 9 months ago. At that time, I had severe adrenal fatigue, experiencing hypothyroid symptoms even though I was on medication, regularly getting sick with colds and flues, and felt completely stressed and overwhelmed with my relationships with boyfriend and his daughter. After seeing Dr. Achuff, I very quickly started feeling better and today have plenty of energy to get me through the day, even on those days when I don't get enough sleep. This is amazing for me because I have had low energy levels almost my entire life. I am much happier in all aspect of my life, am enjoying family time with my boyfriend and his daughter, and am transitioning into a new entrepreneurial career while continuing to work my corporate day job. Dr. Achuff has a wonderful caring and inquisitive personality. She takes her time getting to know and understand you and your symptoms, and I feel very comfortable working with her. - 5/24/2018 good customer service, clean place. variety of natural medicine to buy. When you walk in you will be for sure greeted with a nice smile of the lady in front. Then she will ask if she can help you with anything particular. She was always a great help cause I am always on the go and with my busy schedule and clients, I can't waste time. Thanks for the team in this store. - 6/23/2014 Jeannie is an excellent practitioner. Her ability to listen to your concerns and use her education, experience and intuition to work with you is truly gifted. She really meets you where you are, leaving dogma and institutional medicine behind. In a system where we often have to choose between polar extremes of western and alternative medicine, Jeannie pulls from both and makes a plan that's right for you. - 12/5/2009First to Review Dr. Achuff and I have been working together to iron out some kinks in my health. As a doctor she is a very knowledgeable, thorough, supportive and positive force. While her knowledge of the body is both intuitive and scholarly, it is her genuine care and attention for her patients that truly heals. Berkeley is lucky to have her. - 4/18/2013 Dr. Achuff is an amazing doctor. I had no idea how powerful naturopathic medicine could be. The care is by far superior to anything I have ever experience with any of my General Practitioners thoughout the years. She is patient, thorough and so giving. I love that Dr. Achuff has so much knowledge about diagnostic testing, something I was not sure about in the Naturopathic world. She is like a \"regular\" doctor in that she can order blood tests etc and give you all kinds of information about the results - but she does not rush to a prescription drug as the answer. I have learned so much from her about how my body can heal itself through dietary changes and natural supplemental support. It is truly amazing and profound. I don't know where I would be if i had gone the prescription drug route and am so grateful to have Dr. Achuff and naturopathic medicine for my health and well being.
