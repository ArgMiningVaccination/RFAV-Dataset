Dual Diarrhea Vaccine for Bottom Billion Children Provide a one-line summary of your solution. We developed a Prototype, Cold Chain-Free, Dual-Use Vaccine for Diarrhoeal Diseases (Cholera and ETEC Diarrhea), 2nd leading cause of death in children below 5 years in 79 low-middle income countries. This Game-changing innovation is the First of its kind in diarrheal disease prevention at low cost. What specific problem are you solving? Urgent Need for a Cold Chain-Free Dual-Use Vaccine to protect the bottom billion children from Cholera and ETEC, the diarrheal diseases: Diarrheal diseases, including cholera and ETEC diarrhea, are major causes of death among children under the age of five in 79 LMICs. Nearly, 50% of acute diarrheal infections are attributed to two major waterborne pathogens: Vibrio cholerae cholera and travellers' diarrhea respectively. Cholera's impact is greatest in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Incidence of cholera cases (2.9 million) & 95,000 deaths reported (WHO, 2022). Spread in 79 Countries, 83% of deaths in Sub-Saharan Countries. Around 220 million cases of ETEC diarrhoea globally, with about 75 million episodes in children less than 5 years, resulting in 18 700 to 42 000 deaths (WHO, 2022) with 4 billion economic loss. ETEC is often the first bacterial illness that children experience in endemic areas during their first three years of life which adversely affects a child's physical and cognitive development. Diaherral diseases also affect international travellers who visit LMICs. 900 million tourists travelled internationally in 2022. Around 78% of international travellers get infected within 3 days leading to US 700 Million in medical costs. Distinctly, most diarrheal patients are concurrently infected with V. cholerae and ETEC resulting in severe diarrhea. The pathogenesis of both pathogens is quite similar. To combat these diseases, a cold chain-free, single-dose, live dual-use vaccine is crucial. Cold chain-free, Single-dose, Vaccine for Cholera and ETEC relieves mass vaccination challenges: Vaccination, water, and sanitation are key to controlling diarrheal infections. The existing WHO-licensed oral cholera vaccines (Dukoral\u00ae, Shanchol, and Euvichol\u00ae), require a cold chain supply and multiple doses. Only Dukoral with its rCTB component affords short-term cross-protection against ETEC infection. FDA approved a live cholera vaccine Vaxchora for the travellers' diarrhea market. However, the high cost of these vaccines and maintaining a cold chain supply pose significant challenges in resource-poor settings. Therefore, a cold chain-free, live, attenuated cholera and ETEC vaccine that can be stored at room temperature must be developed to increase its outreach to global immunization programs in LMICs. Eventually, cold chain-free formulation reduces vaccine wastage from heat and freeze-shocks (estimated at ~ US$15-40M/year), lowers capital costs for cold chain equipment (~ US$110M/year), and decreases stockpiling expenses, cutting total operating costs (~ US$125-150M/year) across GAVI countries. Game-changer: Single-dose, Live, Dual-Protection Vaccine for Diarrheal Diseases: Combined vaccines offer improved administration, broader coverage, and increased compliance with complex schedules. Our Prototype, a Cold Chain-Free Dual-Use Vaccine is a groundbreaking innovation in preventing diarrheal diseases, being the \"first of its kind\" for the bottom billion children. The vaccine is patented; GLP studies are in progress and secured fund for phase 0 clinical trials from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Malaysia. Seeking vaccine manufacturer collaboration for the following objectives: - To validate the production process in a GMP facility. - To conduct Phase O Clinical trial - To License technology for the dual-use oral vaccine to a vaccine manufacturer What is your solution? MyCholTM: Prototype, Dual-Use, Live, Cold-chain Free, Oral Vaccine for Cholera and ETEC -Travellers' Diarrhoea at Technology Readiness Level 6 for licensing: The major advantages of our Prototype, Oral, Live, Dual-use vaccine (MyCholTM) for Cholera and ETEC -Travellers' Diarrhoea in comparison to existing killed and live vaccines available in the market are: a) it mimics natural infection by colonization, therefore eliciting immune responses that are highly specific, effective, and long-lasting (b) it would prevent infection by both the Vibrio. cholerae O139 and ETEC pathogens, not just disease symptoms (c) in comparison to highly purified subunit vaccines, it is relatively cheap to produce and administer orally and does not require sophisticated downstream processing or formulation with adjuvants and (d) it is a cold-chain free, live, oral vaccine for human. In brief: - MyCholTM costs less by 40% and remains stable room temperature (25\u00b0C \u00b12\u00b0C and RH 60% \u00b1 5%) for 180 days. - It showed higher colonization potential in the infant mouse colonization assay, and nonreactogenic in the ligated rabbit ileal loop assay. It elicited a 275-fold increase in anti-CT IgG antibodies and a 31-fold increase in vibriocidal antibodies and provided 100% protective efficacy against WT O139 challenge in rabbits. - Mice immunized with MyCholTM IgG. preventing weight loss and diarrhoea, and provided 100% protection in ETEC H10407 challenge studies. - Patent Granted MY-190074-A in Malaysia and PCT in 6 countries. - The low-cost dual-use MyCholTM innovation represents a game-changer in the field of diarrheal disease prevention. We attained the following 3 SDG goals: 1. SDG3: Good Health & Well-being - Live, Single dose & Thermostable - No wastage of vaccine from heat & freeze-shocks (~US$ 15-40 2. SDG9: Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure - Reduction in the capital cost for cold chain equipment (estimated at ~ US$ 110 million/year) - Reduction in the cost of stockpiling & operating costs (US$ 125-150 million/year across GAVI). - Competitive cost (USD 2/person) 3.

Based on the product, Dukoral is predicted to hold a significant share of the market. In this context, we would explore the avenues with these vaccine manufacturers for funding / JV for the technology development and validation and its transfer BALB/c Mice. Vaccines 2022, 10, 2161. [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccin...](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10122161) Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? Vaccinating the Last Child, Last Mile, at Low Cost for Diarrhoeal Diseases: The protection of children's health and well-being plays a vital role in achieving public health and global health objectives. This importance was emphasized in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which have now been succeeded by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 3.2 specifically aims to reduce under-five mortality to a rate as low as 25 per 1000 live births by 2030. However, children under the age of five continue to face significant morbidity and mortality from diarrhoeal and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) worldwide. Diarrhoeal diseases alone account for approximately 9% of under-five mortality (UNICEF, 2016). The current cost of vaccination is approximately $6 per person, which poses a significant barrier in vaccination campaigns. Out of this cost, 23% is allocated for maintaining the cold chain supply, while the remaining 77% is attributed to the production of multiple doses. This cost structure highlights the need for a thermostable/ cold-chain free, live vaccine that can overcome these challenges. Developing such a vaccine is crucial to ensure cost-effective immunization strategies and to achieve the goal of vaccinating the last child, even in the most remote areas, against diarrheal diseases. We developed a Prototype, Live, Oral, Cold chain free, Dual-use Vaccine (MyCholTM) for Diarrhoeal Diseases (Cholera and ETEC diarrhoea), the 2nd leading cause of death among children under the age of five in 79 low-middle income countries. Our target is the bottom 2 billion children, adults in 57 LMICs and international travellers to Sub-Saharan Africa, Haiti, Cameroon, Malawi, Lebanon, Somalia, Pakistan Bangladesh, India and Central America. Vaccination campaigns face a significant hurdle due to the cost of vaccines, which amounts to approximately $6 per person. This expense poses a major barrier to achieving widespread immunization. Interestingly, a notable portion of the vaccination cost, specifically 23%, is allocated solely to maintaining the cold chain supply. The remaining 77% is attributed to producing multiple doses of the vaccine. In this context the developed MycholTM vaccine would eliminate the dependency on the cold chain, making it easier to reach the last child in the most remote areas. By reducing costs and ensuring stability, this approach holds the potential to achieve low-cost vaccination for diarrheal diseases, even in the most challenging regions. Our vision is: \"Vaccinating the Last Child, Last Mile, at Low Cost for Diarrhoeal Diseases\" How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution? Live, Genetically Attenuated, Cold-Chain-Free Cholera & ETEC Vaccine \u2014 A Scientific Journey of 20 Years: It is a collaborative project between AIMST University and USM (University Sains Malaysia). It is a 20 years journey in developing the Dual-use Vaccine (MyCholTM) for Diarrhoeal Diseases (Cholera and ETEC diarrhea). Our cholera vaccine development journey started in 2000 at Universiti Sains Malaysia with the isolation of the hemA gene from Vibrio. cholerae, followed by the development of a gene mutant vaccine candidate VCUSM2 against V. cholerae O139 in 2006. In 2010, VCUSM2 reactogenicity was reduced by replacing its two wild-type ctxA gene copies with mutated ctxA to produce strain VCUSM14. Introducing the hemA gene into VCUSM14 created VCUSM14P, a strain with the ALA prototrophic trait and excellent colonization and immunological properties (100% protection to wild-type challenged rabbits). It was further refined at AIMST (Asian Institute of Medicine, Science and Technology) University, with the completion of single- and repeated-dose toxicity evaluations in 2019 in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, followed by the development of a novel cold-chain-free VCUSM14P formulation in 2020. This 20-year-old study was funded by several federal funding agencies, including various grants from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation and from the Ministry of Higher Education. Over the years, several students and staff members contributed to this project, and we acknowledge them gratefully for their contributions. Details of this journey are described below and summarized below pictures. Our vision is to achieve the goal of \"Vaccinating the Last Child, Last Mile, at Low Cost for Diarrheal Diseases.\" Vaccination campaigns face a major hurdle due to the high cost of vaccines, which amounts to approximately $6 per person. Interestingly, a significant portion of this cost, specifically 23%, is allocated solely to maintaining the cold chain supply. The elimination of the cold chain supply requirement can significantly reduce the cost of vaccine distribution. Instead of allocating nearly a quarter of the cost for cold chain maintenance, resources can be directed towards producing more vaccine doses. Currently, 77% of the vaccination cost is attributed to producing multiple doses of the vaccine. By focusing on low-cost production and efficient distribution, we can reach the last child in the most remote areas, overcoming geographical barriers and logistical challenges. This approach is crucial in achieving widespread immunization and ensuring that no child is left behind. With our vision, we aim to improve global vaccination rates and combat diarrheal diseases effectively. We can significantly impact public health by reducing costs, ensuring stability, and reaching the last mile, particularly in underserved regions. Which dimension of the Challenge does your solution most closely address? In what city, town, or region is your solution team headquartered?Sungai Petani, Kedah, Malaysia In what country is your solution team headquartered? What is your solution's stage of development? Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone Why are you applying to the Prize? The major Objective: Scale-up Validation, and Transfer of Technology required for Commercializing the Dual-use, Cold-chain free live vaccine for diarrheal diseases: MyCholTM is a prototype first-of-its-kind, live, cold-chain free, oral vaccine that provides dual protection against cholera and travellers' diarrhoea caused by Vibrio cholerae and ETEC, respectively. It costs less due to its room temperature storage and distribution and protects the bottom billion poor children and global travellers from diarrheal diseases. The major players in the vaccine industry are Sanofi-aventis Groupe, Emergent BioSolutions Inc., Valneva SE, GlaxoSmithKline plc., Intervet Inc., EuBiologics Co., Ltd., and others. In this context, we would explore the avenues with these vaccine manufacturers for funding / JV for the technology development and validation and its transfer for commercialization. Shanchol and Euvichol-Plus\u00ae are currently available through the Global OCV Stockpile. In 2022, Shantha Biotechnics, a wholly owned Indian subsidiary of the French drug maker Sanofi which produces about 15% of the world's supply of OCV, announced that it would end production and distribution of Shanchol by 2023. UNICEF expects an emergency stock of 30 Million doses whereas the current availability is 16 Million doses. The global stockpile of Oral Cholera vaccines (OCV) is currently insufficient to meet all requests for two doses of preventive vaccination. As a result, on 20 October 2022, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) members (IFRC, MSF, UNICEF, and WHO) took the unprecedented decision to temporarily limit all reactive OCV campaigns to one single dose. The production of OCV is a continuous process with around 2.5 million doses produced monthly. As vaccine manufacturers are producing at their maximum current capacity, there is no short-term solution to increase production. While using a single dose instead of two doses will allow more people to be protected in the short term, this strategy has its limitations, and it is unclear how long immunity will last. To solve the problem in the long term there needs to be an increase in global vaccine production. Hence, we would like to collaborate with a vaccine manufacturer on the following: - 1)To validate the production process in an accredited GMP facility. - 2)To compile the pre-clinical dossier to support the Licensure of Prototype cholera vaccine for Clinical Development - 3)License the technology to produce a cold chain-free live attenuated cholera vaccine. Who is the Team Lead for your solution? Dr Guruswamy Prabhakaran , Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research & Industry Linkage) AIMST UNIVERSITY How is your Team Lead connected to the community or communities in which your project is based? In our pursuit to address the challenges of vaccination for diarrheal diseases, particularly cholera and travellers' diarrhoea, we have developed MyCholTM, a first-of-its-kind live, cold-chain-free oral vaccine. MyCholTM offers dual protection against Vibrio cholerae and ETEC, providing an innovative solution that can benefit the bottom billion underprivileged children and global travellers. Recognizing the significance of collaboration with established vaccine manufacturers, we are keen to explore avenues with major players in the industry such as Sanofi-aventis Groupe, Emergent BioSolutions Inc., Valneva SE, GlaxoSmithKline plc., Intervet Inc., EuBiologics Co., Ltd., and others. We believe that partnering with these manufacturers for funding, joint ventures, and technology development and validation would pave the way for successful commercialization. The current availability of existing oral cholera vaccines (OCV) through the Global OCV Stockpile, such as Shanchol and Euvichol-Plus\u00ae, is inadequate to meet the increasing demand. The decision to temporarily limit reactive OCV campaigns to a single dose due to insufficient supply underscores the urgent need for a long-term solution. To address this, we propose collaborating with a vaccine manufacturer on the following key areas: Validation of the production process in an accredited Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility: This step ensures that the manufacturing process for MyCholTM meets rigorous quality standards, ensuring consistent and reliable vaccine production. Compilation of the pre-clinical dossier to support the Licensure of the Prototype cholera vaccine for Clinical Development: By compiling comprehensive pre-clinical data and documentation, we aim to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and licensure for further clinical development. Licensing the technology to produce a cold chain-free live attenuated cholera vaccine: Through this collaboration, we can transfer our technology to vaccine manufacturers, enabling them to produce the MyCholTM vaccine at scale. The elimination of the cold chain requirement reduces costs and facilitates easier distribution, ensuring broader accessibility and impact. By joining forces with a vaccine manufacturer, we can leverage their expertise, resources, and manufacturing capabilities to accelerate the development, validation, and commercialization of MyCholTM. Together, we can overcome the challenges of vaccine supply and contribute to global efforts in combatting diarrheal diseases, ultimately improving public health outcomes worldwide.
