To best do that, the health system partnered with community organizations and members to complete its fourth Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and develop a plan to address the prioritized needs identified. For this fourth assessment cycle, Penn State Health formed a collective workgroup that included Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Penn State Health Holy Spirit Medical Center, Penn State Health St. Joseph Medical Center, Penn State Health Hampden Medical Center, Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute, Penn State Health Rehabilitation Hospital and key community stakeholders to identify and address the needs of residents living in Berks, Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon and Perry counties. The Lancaster community was included because Penn State Health Lancaster Medical Center was under construction during this assessment. The Department of Public Health Sciences at Penn State College of Medicine coordinated the CHNA efforts. By taking a systemwide approach to data collection and community health planning, Penn State Health will leverage system assets across the service area to address prioritized health needs. The following pages describe the Implementation Plan developed to address these prioritized health needs. We thank all our community partners and employees who joined us to develop this plan to improve health across the region and reduce health disparities. We look forward to further collaborating and partnering over the next three years to strengthen our community together.

These six focus counties represent the community where health care resources are available and provided by the partnering Penn State Health organizations. The counties are also home to the majority of Penn State Health's Plan 2022-2025Page 4 Three Priority Areas The 2021 CHNA gathered community input and compared health trends and disparities across the six-county service area. Specific CHNA steps included a kickoff meeting, monthly hospital leadership meetings, a key informant survey completed by community leaders, a community member survey, a review of other public health data sources already gathered for our service area, a review of our former implementation plan outcomes and resources, and two community partner forums and a steering committee meeting to gather additional feedback and prioritize community health needs. The entire process engaged over 3,000 individuals. Based on this work, our hospitals, in collaboration with our community partners, will focus systemwide health improvement efforts over the next three-year cycle on the identified priority areas of 1) Mental Health 2) Health Equity and 3) Wellness and Disease Prevention. Mental Health includes a focus on community groups, such as the LGBTQ+ community, people of color and youth. Substance use disorder will also be addressed under this priority. Health Equity covers concerns that include access to care, elder issues with access, social determinants of health, racism, diversity, transportation and housing. Wellness and Disease Prevention encompasses food access and nutrition, substance use prevention, chronic disease prevention, health education and physical activity. These priorities are interrelated, and one cannot be addressed without the other. Implementation Plan To develop our Implementation Plan, internal employees and community partners attended a kickoff meeting, where CHNA findings and partner forum recommendations were shared. Participants organized into the following task forces to best develop our plan: 1) Mental Health; 2) Health Equity; 3) Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Prevention; 4) Nutrition and Food Access; and 5) Physical Activity. These task forces met from November 2021 to February 2022 to discuss key findings from the CHNA; explore underserved communities through review of Community Need Index (CNI) scores, life expectancy measures and other key social determinants of health; find additional community partner resources; and develop a plan. The plan includes key program descriptions, goals and objectives to be met over the next three years. A Six-County Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Plan 2022-2025 Page 5Due to the overlapping nature of our priorities, all five task forces have proposed similar programs to expand communication and promote existing resources. All have agreed to continue to meet and engage new partners over the three years of this plan to encourage dialogue among themselves and continue to streamline and strengthen each other's community efforts. Additionally, each task force plans to compile an inventory of community resources that are currently available to not only increase awareness among the group but also to advertise to community members. Not knowing what resources are available and how to access them was a clear message heard during our CHNA process. Through key partnerships with organizations listed at the end of this document, the plan is to make these resources more well known \u2014 through PA 211, for example, a free and confidential service that helps people find the local resources they need 24/7. Our projects focus heavily on community education, another message we heard through our CHNA process. In addition, many of our projects will serve more than one of our identified community needs. For example, increasing our outreach and programming to more food pantries across our service area furthers our work in the areas of Health Equity, Wellness and Disease Prevention and Nutrition and Food Access. Within each priority area, we will be focusing our efforts on communities identified with the highest need. These might be areas with larger minority populations, lower life expectancy and other high-risk groups. Penn State Health has completed five cycles of community health needs assessments and has established a long legacy of community health programming. Many programs identified in our current plan will carry forward into the new plan and be further developed and enhanced. For example: Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute will continue Mental Health Signs and Symptoms training. NARCAN distribution and education, as well as a comprehensive drug safety program, including education, drug take-back days and boxes, lock boxes and DisposeRx drug disposal packet distribution will continue. The Berks County Veggie Rx program has been so successful, it will be expanded into Lebanon County. The Pantries and Wellness Support (PaWS) program started at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center will expand cardiovascular screenings and health education into additional food pantries across our community in all six counties. The Penn State Health Holy Spirit Medical Center Medical Outreach Clinic will bring free health services to community members in the Allison Hill neighborhood of Harrisburg, Pa. Penn State Health Rehabilitation Hospital will plan its extremely popular Rec Fest event to introduce adaptive recreational activities. The Hershey Medical Center bike share program will continue to expand into our community, and the adult and pediatric trauma and injury prevention outreach program will address auto, bike and pedestrian safety. Disease-specific support groups, health screenings and outreach and navigation programs will continue to be a focus of all hospitals to aid and educate our communities. A Six-County Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Plan 2022-2025Page 6 Our dental clinics and residency training programs will serve community members who need this important care to support their overall good health. We will continue annual flu shot events in underserved community locations, ensuring these important vaccines can be received by everyone. We will continue to adapt our programming as needed to respond to COVID-19. All hospitals will partner with the following Penn State College of Medicine experts: Penn State Addiction Center for Translation Penn State Center for the Protection of Children Penn State REACH (Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health) program Penn State PRO Wellness Penn State Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Band Together, strength training program Penn State Cancer Institute Medical student programs, including the Health Systems Science Patient Navigation and Culinary Medicine courses and the Student-run and Collaborative Outreach Program for Health Equity (SCOPE). Penn State Health Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion pipeline programs Penn State College of Medicine Department of Public Health Sciences Community Health Equity & Engagement in Research (CHEER) program Penn State College of Nursing More internal Penn State and Penn State Health projects will be identified to partner with over the course of this plan. The following pages show the actions that will address our prioritized health needs over the next three years, as well as the specific hospital addressing each need. All needs will be addressed in this plan. The information is organized by priority and subcategories, and includes: Description of the health concerns found through the CHNA process The responsible hospitals Initiatives the hospitals intend to implement Anticipated health impact of these strategies based on achieving set goals, indicators and objectives Projected resources Potential community partners related to the plan Strategies included are evidence-based, or strategies that will be evaluated, to ensure the most effective use of community and hospital resources. All outcomes will be tracked and any necessary adjustments to this plan will be shared in annual reports that will be communicated publicly on our websites. A Six-County Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Plan 2022-2025 Page 7Priority #1: Mental Health According to the 2021 County Health Rankings, within the six-county service area, the average number of mentally and physically unhealthy days reported in the past 30 days has continued to increase, with more mentally unhealthy days being reported than physically unhealthy days. Fifty-seven percent of adults who responded to our community member survey had at least one poor mental health day in the past month (up from 54% in the 2018 survey), and 1 in 10 individuals reported 15 or more days of poor mental health. Among the LGBTQ+ population, 63% said depression was a top-three health concern, according to the 2020 LGBTQ Health Needs Assessment. Eighteen percent of community members who responded to our survey needed and received mental health services. However, 1 in 11 individuals needed, but did not receive, mental health services. Furthermore, according to the 2019 Pennsylvania Youth Survey, 40% of children in the service area reported feeling sad or depressed most days in the past year, and 1 in 6 reported considering suicide one or more times in the past year. Goal Improve mental health through prevention, intervention and support. Overarching Indicators/Measurements for Success Reduce the number of poor mental health days reported by adults in the past 30 days.

These often result in gaps in care, which means that some groups of vulnerable populations are receiving less health care than others. According to the United Way's 2020 Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE) report, 27% of households in the service area earn above the poverty level but below the cost of living. One community member stated, \"Many of the supports offered regarding food or health care are aimed at those who are eligible for free government programs, but there are many of us who are in the 'working poor' category who qualify for nothing.\" When asked about inequity in health care, one community leader mentioned, \"Most people are forced to travel outside of an hour to get to doctors who accept Medicaid or Medicare.\" However, many individuals don't seek care at all due to a lack of transportation. The top four reasons why community leaders believe people who have health insurance do not receive care are: inability to afford care, challenges of navigating the health care system, lack of transportation and feeling healthy and thinking they don't need preventive health care. Community members identified social determinants of health, racism, LGBTQ+ discrimination, lack of diversity in health care and housing as additional causes of inequitable care. Goals Bridge systemic gaps in care by expanding community access and navigation points in collaboration with community partners. Expand language and practices that are sensitive to issues like social determinants of health, racism and LGBTQ+ discrimination by promoting trauma-informed care (TIC). Overarching Indicators/Measurements for Success Reduce disparities in life expectancy within our service area. Increase the percentage of adults with a routine checkup in the past year. Decrease the average scores of the Community Need Index, Social Vulnerability Index or Area Deprivation Index. \"Improve competency working with marginalized populations; increase communication between medical, mental health and social support services.\" - Key Informant Survey comment \"I think we need to get services to where people are instead of getting them to the services.\" - Community Member Survey comment\"Build relationships with respected members in the communities that can become a liaison for their community and available resources.\" - Key Informant Survey commentA Six-County Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Plan 2022-2025 Page 11Community Access Points Ensuring that individuals across our service area can access quality health care regardless of circumstance is integral to the Penn State Health mission. The focus of this plan is to identify key partnerships with organizations that are trusted by their communities. These organizations serve as health care access and navigation points to underserved members of our service area through outreach locations and events that provide free or low-cost health care and education. Examples of these include food pantries, health fairs, community centers or any opportunity that can connect a community member to health services or aid in navigating the health care system. Through these connections, we will be better able to target health outreach to communities who need it most. Responsible Party: Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Penn State Health Holy Spirit Medical Center, Penn State Health St. Joseph Medical Center, Penn State Health Hampden Medical Center, Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute and Penn State Health Rehabilitation Hospital. Program Goal Short-Term Objectives (Year 1)Medium-Term Objectives (Year 2)Long-Term Objectives (Year 3) Collaborate with formal and informal community leaders to find community access and navigation points to enhance health outreach.1.

A Six-County Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Plan 2022-2025Page 12 Trauma Informed Communities Penn State Health and its partnering organizations are committed to a TIC model. This is a healing-centered approach that assumes an individual is more likely than not to have a history of trauma. Trauma can include violence, crime, poverty, racism, LGBTQ+ discrimination and the effects of COVID-19. Changes in communities and health care settings can be made to emphasize respecting and appropriately responding to the effects of trauma at all levels. The University of Buffalo and the United Way describe TIC as a shift from asking, \"What is wrong with this person?\" to \"What has happened to this person and how do we help?\" We will assess language used in communities and community organizations to examine stories around trauma, care and health. This will help us to determine how Penn State Health and its partners can make adjustments. Responsible Party: Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Penn State Health Holy Spirit Medical Center, Penn State Health St. Joseph Medical Center, Penn State Health Hampden Medical Center, Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute and Penn State Health Rehabilitation Hospital Program Goal Short-Term Objectives (Year 1)Medium-Term Objectives (Year 2)Long-Term Objectives (Year 3) Expand trauma- informed and healing-centered practices across the service area.1. Collaborate to create and maintain an inventory of community organizations already promoting trauma- informed practices. 1.

In partnership with community organizations, offer 2 TIC trainings to PSH staff that are also open to the community to participate. 2. In partnership with community organizations, offer 2 TIC trainings to PSH staff that are also open to the community to participate.A Six-County Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Plan 2022-2025 Page 13 Priority #3: Wellness and Disease Prevention Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Prevention Engaging our community in health screenings allows for early detection and treatment of many problems. Lack of screening can also indicate lack of access to preventive care, a lack of health knowledge, insufficient provider outreach and/or social barriers preventing utilization of services. According to the 2021 County Health Rankings, within the six- county service area, Dauphin County had the lowest percentage (43%) of female Medicare enrollees with an annual mammogram, and Lebanon County had the highest (49%). However, only 26% of Black females in Lebanon County received an annual mammogram. Among female community members aged 40 or older who responded to our survey, 15% of Hispanic women and 13% of Black women had never received a mammogram, compared to only 6% of white women. Of the community members aged 50 and over who responded to our survey, about 14% had never received a colonoscopy, and these percentages were much higher among Black (24%) and Hispanic individuals (39%). Unfortunately, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, there are more cases of melanoma within our service area compared to Pennsylvania overall. Forty-two percent of community members who responded to our survey reported having been told they have high blood pressure, 39% have high cholesterol and 16% have diabetes. Twenty-two percent of Hispanics/Latinos who responded have diabetes compared to 16% of non-Hispanics/Latinos. Only about 9% of adults who responded to our survey said they smoke cigarettes. However, about 12% of respondents to the 2020 Pennsylvania LGBTQ Health Needs Assessment reported current cigarette use. Furthermore, according to the 2019 Pennsylvania Youth Survey, about 1 in 7 students within our service area reported vaping in the past 30 days. Community leaders who participated in our two forums agreed that we need to focus on education and collaboration to help our community members understand the risk factors for chronic disease and how to prevent them. Goal Improve chronic disease prevention by providing screenings and educational sessions in identified high-need communities. Overarching Indicators/Measurements for Success Increase the number of health screenings provided in high-need community locations that result in education and/or referrals for follow-up care. Participants show improved knowledge of chronic disease risk factor prevention after educational sessions. Increase the percentage of female Medicare enrollees ages 65 to 74 who received an annual mammography screening.\"Dermatologist appointments are not available in a reasonable time frame or at all.\" - Community Member Survey commentA Six-County Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Plan 2022-2025Page 14 Community Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Prevention Programs Penn State Health hospitals and partners will continue to provide opportunities for community screening, education and support programs. These will include collaborating with community partners on larger events in underserved communities, such as the PA Health Equity Tour and national health recognition events, such as the American Heart Association heart and stroke walks, Annual Cancer Education Summit, diabetes awareness fairs, Reading Guts & Glory expo, PA Latino Convention, Berks Encore Health Fair, National Night Out, Lebanon Latino Health Fair and Summerfest, Rec Fest, Pride festivals and Veterans Day health fairs. Partners will also collaborate on smaller educational opportunities with key groups and communities, in both webinar and live session formats. These include chronic conditions support groups, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) screenings and other health messaging through food pantries, cancer educational webinar series, various cancer screenings, diabetes prevention programs, smoking cessation programs and educational programs serving a variety of community audiences.

A Six-County Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Plan 2022-2025 Page 15Nutrition and Food Access Unfortunately, 44% of community members who responded to our survey reported being told they're overweight or obese (up from 41% in 2018), and 1 in 5 children in grades 7 to 12 were found to be obese during the 2017-2018 school year, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health's School Health Statistics. Two large contributors to obesity include lack of exercise and poor diet. While 98% of those community members who responded said they're able to have fresh/healthy foods when they want them, 1 in 8 reported being worried about running out of food before having money to buy more and, according to the 2019 Pennsylvania Youth Survey, 1 in 14 children reported having skipped a meal due to family finances. Recommendations from community leaders who attended our CHNA forums included coordinating efforts regionally and educating in existing infrastructure, such as schools, food pantries, community grocery stores, markets and community gardens. Goal Address issues related to obesity and food insecurity by promoting access to and consumption of healthful diets, and determine the impact of nutrition education and improved access. Overarching Indicators/Measurements for Success Reduce obesity rates in Berks, Lebanon and Dauphin counties. Reduce the percentage of residents with low access to food in Berks, Lebanon and Dauphin counties. Increase the reach of nutrition education and food access to residents of Berks, Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon and Perry counties.\"I feel that food insecurity and poverty lead to a lot of the other factors listed.

Physical Activity Access to exercise opportunities has been decreasing among all counties in the service area, according to the 2021 County Health Rankings. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion states that adults should participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity, aerobic physical activity each week, the equivalent of 30 minutes on at least five days. Of the community members surveyed, less than 30% met the physical activity guideline, and approximately 1 in 5 reported no days of physical activity in the past month. Only 54% were ever told by their health care provider to exercise more. Lebanon County respondents were the least likely to exercise, followed by respondents from Berks and Cumberland counties.

As previously described, we will coordinate with our internal and external community partners to ensure we are making the most effective use of our resources to have the greatest impact on health. The information that follows summarizes annual resources, and the same level of commitment will be provided over the next three years of this Implementation Plan. Overall, in FY 2021, Penn State Health served over 554,000 community members with over 150,000 employee hours and 36,000 volunteer hours, resulting in about $4.6 million in Community Health services. If counting all the COVID-19 response provided, such as community testing sites; vaccine pop-up clinics in underserved communities; transportation vouchers; free OnDemand app to increase access to screening, testing and contact tracing; food pantries, outdoor farm stands and food delivery to COVID-19-positive community members; contact tracing; nursing home support; and public education campaigns, this number would increase to about $7 million. \"Community Health\" contains all health improvement projects offered, including those prioritized by our CHNA process, cash and in-kind contributions, community- building activities and community benefit operations. The following table depicts these accomplishments for each of our hospital locations. Note: Figures were not available for Hampden Medical Center since this facility just opened in 2021. Penn State Health Community Health FY 2021 Metric Hershey St. Joseph Holy Spirit PSH NO COVID-19 Programs$3,683,461 FY $647,280 to sponsorships of community-based health organizations, with precedence given to those addressing prioritized community health needs. Annual Community Relations grants were also awarded. Calendar year 2022 is the seventh year of these grants and, over this time frame, 94 project teams were funded by $350,000. This successful endeavor engages employees to partner with community organizations to start a program addressing at least one of the health need priorities named in the CHNA. Priority is given to sustainable start-up projects that will have a positive health impact on our community. Applications may also be submitted to A Six-County Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Plan 2022-2025Page 20 support preexisting programs and continue their excellent work. Not only do these grants provide local health programming, but they also 1) engage employee talent in community outreach, 2) help develop an organizational culture of community health improvement and 3) provide our employees and students with the opportunity to learn from community partners and better understand the social influences on health that exist outside of our hospital walls. \"Community Benefit\" is the total value or \"bigger picture\" of quantifiable benefits provided to our community and reported to the Internal Revenue Service. This total includes Community Health, mentioned above, as well as Health Professions Education, Subsidized Health Services, Financial Assistance and Medicaid.
