Many people think Annapolis MD chiropractors only treat low back pain. However, chiropractic physicians are trained to treat many different musculoskeletal issues ranging from plantar fasciitis and sprained ankles to tennis elbow and migraines. Chiropractors look at the function of the human body and work with you through hands-on techniques and specific functional exercises to help restore the body to its proper function.

However, the majority of conditions that will respond to our treatment in as few as 5-6 visits. There are some conditions that are more severe and require more visits due to anatomical changes or severe injuries, however, if we are not seeing continued progress we will always refer for the appropriate next step in treatment.
