Diagnosis was the first approach to any illness. Alternative medicine looks at the factors of equilibrium and the environment in which one lives and the disease is considered an imbalance between the two; cleansing the whole body than on a particular problem to get the balance back in sync. Very much the description of the Buddhist and the Greek cultures of medicine and healing the Chem 253 - Organic Chemistry I Lab 10: Isolation of Identification of the major constituent of clove oil 3/15/2012 Purpose: The purpose of this lab was to isolate the cove oil from ground cloves and determine the identity of the major constituent that is known to have the molecular formula C10H12O2 through IR Antimicrobial resistant has been called one of the world's most pressing public health problems. Every time a person takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria are killed, but resistant ones may be left to grow stronger and multiply. Although antibiotics can help treat bacterial infections, a possible side effect is that they can strengthen certain bacterial strains. Antibiotics are supposed to be used for bacterial infections, but are wrongly being used for both viral and bacterial infections. When we use antibiotics on viral infections, deadly bacteria multiplies and becomes stronger. We can fix this problem by using antibiotics for bacterial infections only. Disease description Most people naturally carry the bacteria in their intestines, away from the oxygen that would kill them. Given that our intestines produce different types of bacteria, so if we take antibiotic From a young age, I wanted to be a conventional physician, but as I grew older, I became more disillusioned with our current medical system. As I became more disillusioned, I was more drawn to the naturopathic field and the opportunities it presented to treat problems naturally. In addition, I felt that the naturopathic field offered more personalized care to the patient as they struggled with their different health problems. The way that conventional medicine practices tries to treat as many patients as possible in the shortest amount of time. The field seems not to respect the patient as a person, and I feel like every person should experience a favorable level of respect when interacting with medical professionals. In addition, I feel that patients should know that their doctor cares for them and their health, and that is difficult to convey in a 15-minute appointment, especially when compared with a 45-minute appointment. As a Naturopathic Physician, I feel that I will be able to provide my patients with the care that they deserve. Over the past 10 years, the pharmaceutical formulary for licensed Naturopathic Physicians has absolutely expanded. In many states where Naturopathic Physicians have licensure, they also have the ability to prescribe pharmaceutical drugs to help their patients. While the Physicians may not always choose to go with pharmaceuticals as a treatment Naturopathy focuses on an individualized approach to treating the whole person, with a strong emphasis on health promotion and prevention, Complementary therapies Complementary therapies aim to treat the whole person, not just the symptoms of disease. Complementary therapy is known by different terms including alternative therapy, alternative medicine, holistic therapy and traditional medicine. Therapies include acupuncture, Alexander technique, aromatherapy, chiropractic, herbal medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy, osteopathy, reiki and yoga. In 1892 the practice of embracing natural treatments and letting oneself heal started to grow rapidly so the term \"naturopathy\" was created to identify this new, emerging practice. The practice of naturopathy started in response to the traditional medical doctors using toxic treatments that were potential harmful to the body and spirit. The original philosophies and treatments stem from the works of It can cause something as small as a cold to be able to kill a person. \"Eric was prescribed to many antibiotics as a young child that when he became sick at the age of 10 the had to try 4 different medications before he would start the get better.\"(Renkl, Margaret) When bacteria becomes immune to antibiotics the body has no defense over the disease. The bacteria is stronger than the body's immune system because it has cell walls when human cells do not have walls to protect itself. It can cause serious damage to a person's body, sometimes so serious that when not treated properly it can even lead to At first glance it might seem likely pathogens are really bad for the body. While this is true, it is also true that some infectious disease might have beneficial influences on our body like repair mechanisms and improve the host immune defense. The reason that a pathogen might be beneficial to the host is so that it can stay in the body for a longer period of time if the host is alive and well. Bacteria virulence is the natural selection process of bacteria inside the host's body. It is so that the bacteria that survive will have the best traits that let them lived to a reproduction stage. The bacteria will continue to reproduce passing its successful traits to the younger generation and at a much faster rate comparing to humans. Bacterial infection is treated using a different variety of antibiotics that is available today. It is uncommon for people to understand the reason why the doctors as that the patient should finished their antibiotics even though they felt better. The reason is because when bacteria survive to reproduce it has the ability to pass down the traits that will help the younger generation survive the medication and be able to infect a different host. For that reason to insure that most of the bacteria are kill doctors normally An increasing number of medical schools are now offering courses in alternative medicine for their students, and some hospitals already have alternative medicine departments. The availability of healers and doctors practicing holistic medicine has also increased in recent years, and more and more people are educating themselves in these new fields. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that between 65 and 80 percent of the world's population (about 3 billion people) rely on traditional medicine as their primary form of health care. There are several reasons why I have decided to pursue a career in Naturopathic medicine. First and foremost I want to help people. Septic arthritis in my hip at the age 9 months has led to a lifetime of being constantly involved in many disciplines of the healthcare system. And while medical doctors and surgeons have provided me with the ability to walk and lead a normal life, it was naturopathic and chiropractic doctors that really helped me overcome my overall health concerns. I owe a lot to naturopathic medicine and ultimately wish to become a naturopathic doctor so that I can help other people in ways that I was helped myself. I know that my passion lies within medicine, but the '10 minute appointment followed by a prescription' kind of healthcare does not appeal to me. Homeopathy is a natural healing method based on the principle of \"like cures like.\" This means symptoms are treated with an extremely diluted dose of whatever it is that might have caused the ailment in the first place. The doses of medicine are so diluted; there might not be any These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
