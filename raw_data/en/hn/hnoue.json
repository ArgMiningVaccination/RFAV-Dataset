Such foun dational research is imperative for the future design of robust s ystems that break away from the established tradition of piece-meal patching of current infrastructures.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Quantum Sensors 3.000 4.800 0.000 (U) The Quantum Sensors program is developing approaches to exploit non-classical effects called entanglement to improve the resolu tion and range of military sensors. Quantum sensors will retain the generally better propagation char acteristics of long wavelength lig ht while achieving the better spatial resolution of short wavelength radiation. Co nventional classical sensors rely on light with shorter wavelen gths, like blue light, to produce sharp images. As wavelengths increase, for example from blue to infrared, the classical resolution decreases. Quantum sensors will be able to retain high resolution as the wavelength increases usi ng a non-classical effect called entanglement. Two broad classes of sensor are under consideration. Type I quantum sensors propa gate entangled photons to a target and back to a detector, where quantum effects ma y enhance resolution. Type II quantum sensors propaga te classical radiation to the target, and entangled photons are used within the det ector to improve resolution. A third class of approach, based on ghost imaging, is also being explored. As the program transitions from the th eoretical proof stage to the subsystem design stage in FY 2009 it will move to the Electronic Technology PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.

The project will ensure accessibility and usab ility to a wide range of application deve lopers, not just computational science e xperts. This project is essential for maintaining the nation's strength in both supercompute r computation for ultra large-scale engineering application s and for surveillance and reconnaissance data assimilation and exploitation. (U) One of the major challenges currently faci ng the DoD is the prohibitively high cost, time, and expertise required to build larg e complex software systems. Powerful new approaches and tools are need ed to enable the rapid and efficient pr oduction of new software, including software that can be easily changed to address new requirements and can ad just dynamically to platform and environmental perturbations. (U) Even as this project develops the next ge neration of high-productivity, high-performance computing systems, it is looking furth er into the future to develop the technological and architectural solutions that are required to develop \"extreme computing\" systems. The military will demand increasing diversity, quantities, and complexity of senso r and other types of data, both on the battlefield and in comma nd centers - processed in time to effectively impact warfighters' decisions. Computing assets must progress dramatically to meet significan tly increasing performance and significantly decreasing power and size requirements. Extreme computing systems will scale to deliver a thousa nd times the capabilities of future petascale systems using the same power and si ze or will scale to deliver terascale-embedded systems at o ne millionth of the size and power of petascale systems. The resulting extreme comp uting systems will be capable of scaling from embedded to leade rship class systems. The most significant technical achievements that must be realized to obtain the goals of extreme computing are the en abling architectural advancements, pervasive low power technologi es, and low volume physical packaging of these systems. Numerous additional techni cal challenges must be resolved, including the reliability of \"extreme computing\" systems: embedded systems require a higher level of reliability and assurance than general-purpose systems because the failure of an embedded computing system can result in the loss of a deployed platform.

The goal of this multi-agency program is to develop revolutionary flexible and well-balanced computer architectures that will deliver high perfo rmance with significantly improved productivity for a broad spectrum of applications. (U) It is extremely difficult to program today's high-performance co mputers; even for expert prog rammers, these systems present a s ignificant challenge. The programming of such large systems must be made mu ch easier so that programmers and scientists with minimal comp uter skills can harness the power of high-performance computers. As the num ber of processors increases to 100,000 and beyond, it is diffic ult not only to develop application codes, but also to debug and optimize them, since tools that will help are designed for small-scale systems (10's of processors). This area of user productivity is where HPCS is focusing significant effort. The HPCS technology development pla n is being executed in three phases that will extend to the end of this decade. The three phases are (I) concept design study, (II) resea rch and development, and (III) system development, resu lting in large-scale prototypes. (U) Initiated in 2002, the DARPA HPCS program is responsive to a stra tegy developed in conjunction w ith the U.S. National Security Community. The ultimate goal of the HPCS program is to create a new generation of economically viable high productivity comput ing systems for the national security and industrial user communities. High productivity computing is a key technology enabler for meeting our national security and economic competitiveness requirements. In November 200 6, the HPCS program moved into the third and final phase, w ith a down- select from three vendors to two. In Phase III of the HPCS progr am, the two remaining vendors will complete the designs and te chnical development of very large (petascale) productive supercomputers, w ith demonstration of prototype systems in 2010-2011. DARPA f unding is sufficient to cover the contractual requirements of one of the tw o selected vendors. NSA and DOE, partners with DARPA in this program, provide funding to enable maintaining a second vendor in the program. 44UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 5 of 34 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-02 (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Performed a down-select from the three HPCS Ph ase II participants to two Phase III participants.

(U) The Software Producibility program will redu ce the cost, time, and expertise required to build large complex software systems. This includes new techniques for rapidly developing adaptive software that can be easily changed to conform to new software design a nd development tools, readily complies to new requirements, and mically to environmental pertur bation. Today, production-quality compilers are developed at significant cost for a defined class of systems rega rdless of the actual system resources available to and/or need ed by an application. This places significant programming burden on developers when creati ng applications who must consider the platform and its appl ications. Improvements in compiler technology can greatly simplify applicat ion development by providing the capability to automatically a nd efficiently generate a compiler that reliably executes a broad spectrum of m ilitary and industrial applications for target computing system s that range from a single multi-core processor system to very large multi-processor sy stems. Military systems critically depend on complex softwa re that is reliable, robust, and secure. Mature software frameworks (e.g., Apple Co coa, Microsoft Foundation Class libra ry, Java Swing, JBOSS, SDL, etc.) provide well tested and well-considered mechanisms that, if used properl y, can enable developers to quickly create sophisticated applic ations of high quality. But designers/developers have a very steep learning curv e when working in a new framework. A combination of fundamen tal software analysis and tool assistance can enable so ftware developers to function effectively at the expert level in multi-framework envi ronments but without the excessive investments of time required by current techniques.

(U) The Extreme Computing program will enable ExaScale computing systems in the post-2010 timeframe, with processing that will exce ed one quintillion (10^18) operations (floating point, fixed point or data movement), per second. Significant technical roadblock s to scalable performance, productivity, physical size, power, and programmability must be overcome to realize the goals of extreme computing . As Moore's law reaches its limit, we can no longer depend on significantly increasing clock rates for performance advances. Current and e volutionary bandwidth and latency of data movement operations and current data placement approaches will not be sufficient to sustain antic ipated or desired increases in processing performance. It will be essential to find new techniques that minimize data movement and optimize data communication performance. (U) Ensuring dramatic advances in processing performance is critical as th e amount and type of raw data needing to be turned into a ctionable information rapidly escalates. Previously, advances in commercia l off-the-shelf (COTS) systems have addressed these needs but future COTS processors are ill-suited for developing military requirements because they are increasingly less productive for military appli cations, are power- 47UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 8 of 34 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-02 hungry, and limit the performance available to the warfighter. To support escalating processing needs both at the embedded and supercomputer level, completely new architectures at the processor/memory/data m ovement and system level are needed to enable extreme computi ng.

Self-monitoring hardware in conjunction with co-developed softw are will incorporate cognitive techniques to determine the state, perform ance, and health of the processing system, and based on the pro cessing system's self-evaluation, will reconfigure to provide optimized system performance.

This effort researched, prot otyped, and evaluated defenses that sensed failures and attacks on military tactical wireless networks and auto-reconfigured in real-time to provi de continuous service of mission-critical ac tivities. The next step of the DCAMANET program will be to develop an intrinsically assurable mobile ad-hoc network. An intrinsically assurable mobile ad-hoc network will directly su pport integrity, availability, reliability, confidentiality, and safety of MANET comm unications and data. In contrast, the dominant Internet pa radigm is intrinsically insecure. For example, the Internet does not deny unauthorized traffic by default and therefore violates the pri nciple of least privilege. In addition, there are no provisions for non-repudiation or accountability and therefor e adversaries can probe for vulnerabilit ies with impunity because the likelihood of attributing bad beha vior to an adversary is limited. Current protocols are not robust to purposely i nduced failures and malicious behavior, leaving entire Internet-based sy stems vulnerable in the case of defensive failure.

This program seeks to develop technologies such as novel computer processing architectures, hardware, firmw are, or microkernels to guarantee network and workstation security and will initially focus on network-based monitoring approaches that provide maximum coverage of the network with pe rformance independent of the network size. These technologies will protect Defense syst ems from a wide-range of software problems, ranging from worms and Trojan hor ses, to bug-ridden software. Th is effort will focus on the d evelopment of feedback control-based solutions to soft ware vulnerabilities and gateway-and-below ne twork traffic monitoring approaches that s cale with network size. The design of the controller component will leverage virt ual machines to provide hardware-equivalent protection for the controller that specifically monitors the trustworthiness state of the applicati on of interest, map the observati ons to a model of trustworthin ess for that application, then decide what, if any, control actions need to be taken. Operational goals of the network- monitoring component include (1) improved probability of detection/probabilit y of false alarm performance and (2) scalability to future gateway line speeds. The desired result is to allow software to be imperfect while mitigating catastrophic failures.

This program will develop advanced capabilities to monitor the WANs that will comprise the GIG to detect malicious behavior, ro uting problems, or compromised mission capability. Goals include improved det ection and false-alarm performan ce over conventional intrusion de tection systems and scalability to the larger networks. This technology will s upport the DoD's GIG Information Assurance Technical Framework.

This progr am is examining the potential of these same goals, by addressi ng not just the physical layer but also the entire network stack. Similar to fre quency-hopping spread spectrum, the approach of this program s tudies algorithms that would provide hopping between Internet Protocol addresses an d then expanding to hopping betw een different permutations of layer 1-3 protocols. The utility will provide signif icantly improved security against a variety of network attack and identification pro files.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (CBMANET) program is developing an adaptive networking capability that dramatically improves performance and reduces life-threatening communication failu res in complex communication ne tworks. In order to develo p this new capability, the initial focus is on tactical mobile ad-hoc networ ks (MANETs) that are inadequate ly supported with commercial te chnology. 60UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 21 of 34 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-03 Conventional MANETs are composed of interd ependent nodes based on interdependent system layers. Each MANET node exposes tens t o hundreds of configurable parameters that must be continuously ad apted due to variable tactical factors such as mission profile, phase, force structure, enemy activity, and environmental conditions. The comple xity of this high-dimensional, adaptive, constrained, distr ibuted network configuration problem is overwhelming to hum an operators and designers and has root causes in the historically wire-line-orient ed networking paradigms. This program will take on the ambitious goal of researching a novel protocol stack that supports integrated optimiz ation and control of all network layers simultaneously. Key technical challenges in clude scalable design, stability, and convergence. These challe nges are particularly difficult in a distributed setting with partial and uncertain in formation, high communications overhead, and high probability o f link failure. To address this problem, the CBMANET program will exploit recent op timization-theoretic breakthroughs, recent information-theoreti c breakthroughs, and comprehensive cross-layer design to develop a network stack from first principles with specific attention to support for DoD applications such as multicast voice and situation awareness. (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Designed and prototyped two novel network protocol architectures based on in formation theory and optimization theory. Designed and analyzed protocols based on network coding that vastly impr ove performance in extreme conditions.

Today's military software systems are britt le in the face of changing requirements. They are vulnerable to skilled attackers who develop creative and unpredic table strategies. Misconfigu ration accounts for most security failures in Internet services and poses a serious ri sk to military systems. This program will develop security a ware systems that will avoid brittleness and vulnerability, due to their ability to reason about thei r own security attributes, capabilities and functions with respect to specific mission needs. These systems will also dynamically adapt to provide desired levels of service while minimizing risk a nd providing coherent explanations of the relative saf ety of service level alternatives. These systems will bolster the reliability and sec urity of critical open source software systems by reducing vulnerabilities and logic errors , and providing state-of-the-art software analysis techniqu es augmented with cognitive decision-making techniques with the ultimate goal of a pplying these systems on to the Global Information Grid. The S ecurity-Aware Systems program consists of two efforts, Applications Communities (AC) and Self-Regenerative Systems (SRS). The Application Communities (AC) effort will develop technologi es to protect DoD information sy stems that employ commercial software applications against cyber attack and system failure by developing collaboration-based defenses that detect, respond t o, and heal with little or no human assistance. The effort will leverage a dvances in information assurance research programs to create a n ew generation of self-defending software that automatically responds to threats, and pr ovides a comprehensive picture of security properties, displayed at multiple levels of abstraction and formality. This capability will bri ng intelligent security adaptation to DoD s ystems and make security properties and status more a pparent to decision makers. AC technology will enable collections of similar systems to collaboratively generate a shared awareness of security vulnera bilities, vulnerability mitigation strategies, and early warning s of attack. AC will revolutionize the security of military information syst ems and reduce the threat from stealthy intrusion of critical sy stems and/or denial of service attacks. The Self-Regenerative Systems (SRS) effort will design, develop, demonstrate and validate architectures, tools, and techniques for fielding systems capable of adapting to novel threats, unanticip ated workloads and evolving system configurations. SRS technol ogy development of this effort will employ innovative techniques like biologically-inspired diversity, cognitive immunity and heali ng, granular and scalable redundancy, and higher-level functions such as reasoni ng, reflection and learning. SRS technologies will make cri tical future 62UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 23 of 34 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-03 information systems more robust, survivable and trustworthy. SRS will also develop technologies to mitigate the insider threat . SRS- enabled systems will be able to reconstitute their full func tional and performance capabilities after experiencing accidental c omponent failure, software error, or even an in tentional cyber-attack. These systems will al so show a positive trend in reliability, ac tually exceeding initial operation capability and approaching a theoretical optimal performance level over long pe riods while maintaining robust ness and trustworthiness attributes. (U) Research efforts will also explore workst ation-class systems (including \"trusted systems\") which at present do not provide prov able separation of information at different sec urity levels, or provable protection of hi gh-integrity applications from low-integrit y applications. A new kind of computer workstation is needed whose architecture enab les both formal proof and exhaustive validation of critical infor mation and program separation properties (e.g., information in one graphical user interface (GUI) window never leaks to another GUI window ). (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Developed an Application Community (AC) system architecture an d demonstrated a working prototype that showed learning of program behavior that can be used to protect and repair software systems. FY 2008 Plans: Develop techniques to collaboratively dia gnose and respond to problems (e.g., attacks or failures that threaten a mission) in g roups of military systems. Develop techniques to summarize security policy and status so the descriptions produced by AC can be understood without omittin g critical details. Develop static and dynamic source code anal ysis techniques (e.g., data and control-fl ow-based techniques, model-checking, stron g typing) to relate software module structures and runtime stat e with the representation of security properties/configurations. Demonstrate self-explanation techniques in which systems explain their critical security properties and status in a manner that is understandable to a variety of managing so ftware components and human operators. Develop additional general strategies to au tomatically immunize systems against new a ttacks and preempt insider enabli ng anomaly detection, combining and correlating information fro m system layers, and using direct user challenges.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Quantum Key Distribution over Wide-Area Fiber Optic Networks 0.000 0.000 3.000 (U) The prevailing method for securing information transmitted across Do D and Intelligence networks is through the use of end-to-en d encryption. This requires frequent secure distribution of encryption keys across the network. Quantum key distribution could offer this capability across the network, resulting in enhanced security from eavesdropp ing, code-breaking and spoofing. The program's objective is to develop an end-to-end quantum key distribution capability that works over a wide -area fiber-optic network. To day, this technology has bee n demonstrated only for point-to-point connections over distances of less than 200 kilometers. A key technical challenge is to extend the qua ntum key distribution capability to national, or global, dynamically switched fiber-optic networks. The needed advancements to enable this are the c reation of a \"quantum repeater\" and the development of the associated key dist ribution protocol. The goal of the program is to demonstrate this capability experimentally over an existing DoD wide-area test network. (U) Program Plans: FY 2009 Plans: Complete an analysis of quantum encryption over classic fiber-optic networks. Develop candidate technologies and protocols for quantum key distribution over global-scale fiber-optic networks. 64UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 25 of 34 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-03 Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 System for Planning Information Operations and Nonkinetic Effectiveness (SPINE) 0.000 0.000 3.417 (U) The System for Planning Information Operations and Nonkinetic Effectiveness (SPINE) program will improve operational effectiven ess, operational tempo, tool performance, tool development, decrease training requirements, enable scalable operations not possible today, and demonstrate the full potential of Information Operations (IO) capabilities due to their newly quantified performance metrics. The significant challenge is the development of models fo r non-kinetic weapons that are comparable to today's physics-based kinetic models. Th ose models are critical to demonstrating the effectiveness of non-kinetic weapons and c onfiguring an IO range capable of collecting the divers e empirical data required to provide confidence in the measurements. The program will develop the following: first, measurement techniques to q uantify the effectiveness of IO weapons; second, a planning system to give the combatant commander the ability to determine which combinati on of kinetic or non-kinetic weapons they should use during operations.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Defensive Autonomous Systems 0.000 0.000 3.000 (U) The Defense Autonomous Systems goal is to allow the military to more closely monitor and identify remotely-controlled computers (bots) and bot slaves within military and government networks, as we ll as increase the monitoring capabilit y of our defenders. This p rogram will develop novel software to enable this ca pability. Utilizing the border gateway prot ocol, this program will provide policy base d routing between large pieces (i.e., autonomous systems) of the Internet. By bu ilding concentric rings from autonomous systems, it is possible to hide all or part of a network from people outside of the rings (e.g. on the Internet ). By monitoring the interconnection points between the outer and inner ring, it is possible to identify all bot slaves and controllers because bot command and control traffic is fairly regular and has a unique signature. In order to monitor and mitigate against attacks from bot networks we must automate the tools we currently use. Adding the additional auto nomous systems to existing military networks requires the military Services to request the new autonomous system, properly design and configur e the interconnection, and monitor the system to detect an attack within minutes. 66UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 27 of 34 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-03 (U) Program Plans: FY 2009 Plans: Identify specific bot signatu res and their uniqueness.

The technologies and systems developed in this pro ject will enable our military to automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a varie ty of means. (U) Current U.S. military operations involve close contact with a wi de range of cultures and peoples. The warfighter on the ground needs hand-held, speech-to-speech translation systems that enable co mmunication with the local population during tactical missions. Thus tactical applications imply the need for two-way (foreign-language -to-English and English-to-fo reign-language) translation. (U) Because oadcasts, web-posted content, an d captured foreign-language hard-c opy documents can provide ins ights regarding local and regional events, attitudes and activities, la nguage translation systems also contribute to the development of good strategic intelligence. Such applications require one-way (foreign-language-to-English) transl ation. Exploitation of the resulting tran slated content requires the capability to automatically collate, filte r, synthesize, summarize, and present rele vant information in timely and relevant forms.

(U) The Global Autonomous Language Exploitation ( GALE) program will develop and integrate t echnology to enable automated transcript ion and translation of foreign speech and text along with content su mmarization. Presently, the explo itation of foreign language s peech and text is slow and labor intensive. GALE will provide , in an integrated product, automated tr anscription and translation of foreign spee ch and text along with content summarization. When applie d to foreign language broadcast media and web-posted content, GALE will enhance open-so urce intelligence and local/regional situational aw areness and eliminate the n eed for translation and subject matter experts at ever y military site where such information is obtained. Thus, GA LE will also reduce the military manpower re quirements for translators and mitigate the escalating need for trained support personnel. GALE will tightly integrate multidi sciplinary research and produce prototype systems. Earlier DARPA work in foreign language processing yielded an initial integrated architect ure concept for speech transcription and text translation, r esulting in near edit- worthy text. Continuing work under GALE will produce a fully ma ture integrated architecture and dramatically improve transcrip tion and translation accuracy by exploiting context and other clues. GA LE will address unstructured speech such as talk show conversati ons and chat room communications and develop timely, succinct repor ts and alerts for commanders and warfighters. (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Designed and documented a GALE architecture based on the industry standard Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA). Created architectural components that combine the output of multiple machine translation engines. Identified workflows of all processing engines and provided integr ation of these workflows on top of the architectural foundati on. Developed an integrated approach where the problem is viewed mathematically as a single system, with foreign speech/text as inp ut, and English text and distilled information as output. Evaluated GALE translation engines on Arabic and Chinese la nguages for structured and unstructured speech and text. Improved translation capabilities, reducing the translati on errors by a factor of two in the first year.

Unfortunately, due to limited human resources an d the immature state of applicable technology, our military do es not currently have the ability to exploit, in a timely f ashion, ideographic and script documents that are either machine printed or handwritt en in Arabic or Chinese. The MADCAT program will address this need by producing devices that would enable soldiers to convert such captured do cuments to readable English in the field. MADCAT will substantially improve the applicable technologies, in particular document analysis and optical character recognition/optical handwriting recognition (OCR/OHR), tightly integrate these with translation technology, and creat e technology demonstration prototypes for field trials.

These technologies will lead to systems with increased self reliance, cooperative behavior, the capacity to reconfigure them selves, and survivability with reduced programmer intervention. In the real-time environment of military operations, cognitive networks and systems that can learn, r eason, draw on their experience, automatica lly adapt to maintain critical functionality, effectively assist their military user and improve their responses over time will be crucial t o operational success. These capabilities will make the difference be tween mission success and mission degradation or failure, even in the event of cy ber-attack or component attrition resulting from kinetic warfare or accidental fa ults and errors. Systems that learn and reason will reduce the requirement for skilled system administrators and dramatically reduce the overall co st of system maintenance. As the military moves towards a dynamic expeditionary force, it is critical for systems to become more self sufficient. Overall, the project will extend fundamental c omputing capabilities to deal with real-world information complexity and uncertainty.

(U) The Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL ) program seeks to enable intelligence in information processing systems so that cri tical DoD systems can better support, not burden, the warfighter. Due to DoD/ military reductions in manpower levels, and in spite of the integration of advanced information technologies and auto mation throughout defense systems, the wo rkload on the warfighter steadily increases. Modern computing systems, though powerful, are woefully lacking in the capability to self-configure, adapt, and learn. They lack even rudimentary intelligence. This deficiency places a heav y burden on the warfighter to operate and maintain the very information technology on which modern warfare depends. The PAL program will devel op advanced technology to enable a new cl ass of cognitive systems capable of assist ing military commanders and decision makers. PAL will build upon prior DARPA programs that deve loped improved human-computer interaction capabilities and highly-responsive computing systems. PAL systems will be able to plan ahead a nd understand the world well eno ugh to plausibly anticipate future events. Most importantly, PAL systems will have embedded learning capabilities that will allow them to retai n prior learned knowledge, apply this knowledge to new scenarios and ultimately provi de faster and more effective assistance. Overall, the abi lity to learn will enable the performance of a PAL system to improve over time. Cognitive systems technologies deve loped in this program will be applied and demonstrated in the Increased Command and Control Effectivenes s (ICE) program (PE 0603760E, Project CCC-01) prior to transition into Command Operations.

Narrative Title FY Learning* 15.740 20.011 17.160 *Previously this was part of Foundational Learning Technology. (U) The Integrated Learning program is creating a new computer le arning paradigm in which systems learn complex workflows from warfighters while the warfighters perform their regular duties. Current machine learning technologies cannot learn these compl ex workflows. The effort is focused on military planning tasks such as air operations center (AOC) planning and military medical logistics. With this learning technology, it will be possible to create many different types of military decision support systems that learn by watching expe rts rather than relying on hand-encoded knowledge (which is expensiv e and error prone to produce). The new l earning paradigm differs from conventional machine learning in that it does not rely on large amounts of carefully cr afted training data. Rather, in the new paradigm the learner works to \"figure things out\" by combining many different types of learning, reasoning, an d knowledge. For instance, to learn AOC tasks, the computer l earner combines what it observed the warfighters doing with the knowledge it has about aircraft, and reasons a bout airspace de-confliction to c reate a generalized model that can then be used to perform the entire AOC task, or provide intelligent instruction to other warfighters performing the same task. Such a cognitive system will ultimately need the capability to build and update its own internal model of the world and the objects in it without human input. (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Successfully formulated learning as an inte grated problem solving process and devel oped representation languages that enable different components, e.g., planning, r easoning, simulation, etc., to share information during the learning process.

Expand systems so they combine different types of knowledge and reasoning, based on the situation and information that is avail able. Modify existing algorithms so they emit and track uncertainty about information. Evaluate systems by having them learn expanded/full air control or der (ACO) planning processes and procedures and military medi cal evacuation planning. FY 2009 Plans: Modify the integrated learning systems so they can incorporat e new software components dynamically and utilize the new capabili ties while learning. Create control algorithms for the systems that manage credit-and- blame assignment on a component-by-component basis so that if conflicts arise the system can reason about which piece of conflicting information is more likely to be accurate. Create control algorithms that reason about the costs/benefits of resolving a particular conflict and direct system performance accordingly. Expand the scope of the problems being learned so the systems learn full air tasking order (ATO) planning processes and full mi litary medical logistics planning.

(U) The Bootstrapped Learning program will provide computers with th e capability to learn complex con cepts the same way that people do, from a customized curriculum designed to teach a hierarchy of concepts at increasing levels of complexity, where learning each new level depends on having successfully learned the previous level.

In Bootstrapped Learning, at each level, a rich set of knowledge sources (suc h as training manuals, examples, expert behaviors, simula tors, and references and specifications that are typically used by people learning t o perform complex tasks) will be combined and used to generate concepts and a si milar set of knowledge sources for the next level. This will ena ble rapid learning of complex high-level concepts, a capability th at is essential for autonomous military syst ems that will need to understand not on ly what to do but, ultimately, why they are doing it, and when what they are doing may no longer be appropriate. To be useful, a military system must not only carry out the specific task/mission for which it is programmed but also be able to reflect on its own ab ility to do so, and do this i n the context of its operator/controller's intent. (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Created a general purpose \"Ladder Interface \" used to decouple the bootstrapped learning system from the problem domains and instructional materials provided to them. Developed a pair of components that toge ther implement both sides of the ladder in terface and will serve as development aids. FY 2008 Plans: Produce an initial prototype end-to-end system capable of bootstra pped learning, integrating different types of learning, input modalities, and repeatedly building on prior learning. Develop a complete electronic curriculum for three domains, including prerequisite knowledge, teaching algorithms, as well as curriculum development tools. Demonstrate a specific ability to learn a curriculum composed of at least three related lessons via at least three different in teraction modalities and at least two different learning processes. FY 2009 Plans: Demonstrate a single system capable of being inst ructed to perform in th ree diverse domains. Demonstrate the ability of a system to rep eatedly acquire new knowledge that drives fu ture learning and cumulatively adds to th e system's knowledge. Validate that configuration and control of critical, autonomous military hardware can be addr essed with bootstrapped learning technology. 84UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 11 of 28 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 Knowledge Representation a nd Reasoning Technology 1.147 2.346 7.807 (U) The Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Technology program w ill develop enabling technologies to acquire, integrate, and use high performance reasoning strategies in knowledge-ri ch domains. Such technologies will provide DoD decision makers with rapid, rel evant knowledge from a broad spectrum of sources th at may be dynamic and/or inconsistent . Significant reasoning challenges arise fro m the fact that critical knowledge involves context, temporal information, comp lex belief structures, and uncertainty. To address these challe nges new capabilities are needed to ex tract key information and metadata, and to explo it these via context-capable search and inference (both deductive and inductive). DoD systems sense, capture, and store information in th e form of text, audio, imagery, and video. Therefore, adva nced machine reasoning capabilities must extract knowledge from and reason about all types of multimedia data. Visual-spatial reasoning, wh ich is perhaps the most powerful form of human reasoning, yet the one least covered by machine cognition, is of special interest. This research w ill explore new computational models to enable command and control systems to use conceptual representations to perform visual-spatial reasonin g and to assist the commander in understanding and an alyzing complex battlefield scenarios. (U) The cost of handcrafting information with in the narrow confines of first order logi c or other artificial intelligence (AI) form alisms is prohibitive for many applications. Machine reading addresses these issues by replacing the expert (and associated knowledge en gineer) with un- supervised or self-supervised learning systems, systems that \"rea d\" natural text and insert it in to AI knowledge bases, i.e. da ta stores especially encoded to support subsequent machine reasoning. Machine readi ng requires the integration of multiple technologies. Natural l anguage processing must be used to transform the text into candidate internal representations.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Foundational Learning Technology 17.317 14.603 12.000 (U) The Foundational Learning Technology program seeks to develop advanced machine lear ning techniques that enable cognitive systems to continuously learn, adapt and respond to new situations by drawing inferences from past experience and existing information sto res. Foundational Learning technologies have broad applicability to cognitive systems, and will result in military systems that are more robust, self-sufficient, and require minimal or no platform-specific customization. Current efforts will develop hybrid learning techniques to create cogni tive systems capable of learning military strategy, leveraging large amounts of prior knowledge, incorporating extern al guidance and applying prior knowledge in real- time to the naturally changing environment, all without programmer intervention. This includes the integration and application of advanced machine learning techniques to further enable cognitive computi ng systems to learn from experience and adapt to changing situat ions. A very promising approach involves transfer learning techniques that tr ansfer knowledge and skills learned for specific situations to novel, unanticipated situations and perform appropriately and effectively the first time a novel situatio n is encountered. This is essential becaus e most military 86UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 13 of 28 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 operations occur in ever-changing en vironments and U.S. forces and systems must be able to act appropriately and effectively th e first time each novel situation is encountered. (U) Recent advances in neuroscience suggest that much of the rich and varied structure of the neo-cort ex may be the natural consequ ence of a relatively simple cortical algorithm adapting itself to the structure latent in the in put it receives from the world. It is th erefore plausible to seek advances by modeling the sub-symbolic \"instruction set\" of the br ain. Success here would provide alternatives to the symbolic approaches that currently predominate in areas such as perception, reasoning, and language. (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Demonstrated the ability of a cognitive ag ent to learn large amounts of knowledge fo r performance in a specified domain on an unknown task within the same domain. Designed and developed hybrid learning syst ems that allow cognitive systems to generalize based on information gathered; and le arn to operate successfully in similar, but not identical situations, adapt to a wide va riety of naturally-occurring situations, an d perform better over time. FY 2008 Plans: Demonstrate the ability of a cogn itive agent to learn, combine, and restructure knowledge in multiple domains and apply this to solve novel problems in those domains. Demonstrate the ability of a cogn itive agent to generalize knowledge from particular domains and discover how to apply it to a problem in a new domain. Demonstrate the ability of a cognitive ag ent to synthesize knowledge and skills ac quired from multiple domains, apply them effectively to problems in new domains, and demonstrate the ab ility to propose novel problem solution methods when specified resources are unavailable. FY 2009 Plans: Conceptualize and propose algorithms that can take unorganized numeric inputs and, through interaction, \"see\" that these inputs represent some structured universe that obeys structured laws. Construct a single, massively parallel, general-purpose algorithm which could start with zero knowle dge of its environment, and then grow to represent the structure latent in that environment. 87UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 14 of 28 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 Narrative Title *Formerly Learning Locomotion and Navigation. (U) The Robust Robotics program will develop advanced robotic technol ogies that will enable autonomous (unmanned) mobile platforms to perceive, understand, and model their envi ronment; navigate through complex, irregul ar, and hazardous terrain; make intelligent decisions corresponding to previously programmed goals ; and interact cooperatively with other autonomous and manned vehicles. These capa bilities will enable robotic vehicles to support warfighters in a variety of s ituations and terrains, including transportation, logistics, re connaissance, and active battle. A key objective is robust navigati on and locomotion, since this underlies th e ability to move through the difficult an d unpredictable terrain of theater operations, which may include highly irregular and m ountainous areas, partially-destroyed roads, rubble-filled urban terrain, and other vehicles and personnel. This program al so supports the DARPA Urban Challenge. (U) Within the program area, efforts are being made to develop l earning and reasoning technologies to address specific concerns in both wheeled and legged robotic systems. Current systems for autonom ous ground robot navigation typical ly rely on hand-crafted, han d-tuned algorithms. While these systems may work well in open terrain or on roads with no traffic, performance falls far short in obst acle-rich and highly- irregular environments. In contrast, the a pproach taken here is to develop systems that automatically learn to interpret senso r data and apply this knowledge to actuator control to improve lo comotion and navigation in complex environm ents. Learning techniques will include ( but not be limited to) reinforcement learning and learning from examples. These advancements will open ne w horizons for unmanned military operations, surveillance and reconnaissance, and drama tically advance the capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Tasks requiring higher-leve l computation, such as perception-based navigation and a high degree of freedom articulation will greatly benefit as well. (U) Although current approaches to autonomous na vigation of unmanned vehicles have achieved notable success in recent years, they s uffer from limitations, having been developed for st atic environments and not for dynamic real-world environments. Examples of the c hallenges posed by a complex dynamic real-world environmen t include: (1) robotic vision outdoors, unde r windy conditions that result in the mov ement of vegetation, trees, and leaves and, when a body of water is present, waves; and (2 ) path-planning in the presence of moving \"obs tacles\" such as people and other (manned or unm anned) vehicles. Improvements in robotic vi sion and scene understanding, including the capabili ty to predict the future location and even the intent of moving objects, need to be integrated with more sophisti cated approaches to path plannin g. This would set the stage for autonomous interacting robots that share informati on and collaborate in performing tasks. For example, interacti ng robots could 88UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 15 of 28 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 collaborate in planning/traversing a diversity of routes and ther eby enhance their likelihood of quickly finding a viable and/o r (nearly) optimal path. (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Explored various learning technologies that enabled rapid adapta tion by robots to new physical environments and improved autonomous vehicle speed over rough terrain. Developed several learning methods that a llowed learned navigation algorithms to surp ass the performance of a baseline system w hich was demonstrated through several experiments. Explored \"learning from example\" and \"reinforcement learning\" app lications to develop technology for autonomous vehicle systems to learn and gather experience without relying on a programmer to anticipate all eventualities. These learning approaches were evaluated through a series of tests in varying terrains. Funded technology development contracts and program planning support for the DARPA Urban Challenge. FY 2008 Plans: Create new learning algorithms that use dynamic gaits to enable le gged laboratory robots (that ar e small scale versions of oper ational sized platforms) to run over uneven terrain. Evaluate the new learning algorithms on a series of different terrain settings in a competitive fashion. Transfer the best performing navigation methods learned on a smal l-scale vehicle to the large robotic vehicle, Crusher, to oper ate at increased speeds in complex environments. Fund prizes and support for the DARPA Urban Challenge. FY 2009 Plans: Create new and modify existing learning algorithms to enable le gged laboratory robots (that are small scale versions of operati onal sized platforms) to run over terrain at speeds proportional to humans. Evaluate the new learning algorithms on a series of different terrain settings in a competitive fashion. Port learning locomotion algorithms to larger scale ve hicles to increase mobility of larger scale robots. Create learning locomotion toolkits that will control a di verse set of high degree-of-freedom vehicles on rough terrain. 89UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 16 of 28 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 (U) Other Program Funding Summary Cost: Not Applicable. 90UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 17 of 28 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 (U) Mission Description: (U) Warfighting is not an individual activity. Battles, engagements, and even peace keeping missions are won by teams of warfighte rs working in concert with each other and the automated system s that support them. These warfighters are operating in hard settin gs where action, information, and decision making are distributed and the situa tion is constantly changing. In these settings, communications, information sharing, and tools that support warfighter coordination are critical. (U) The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces Project will dram atically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable fast er, better informed, and more hi ghly coordinated actions than those of our enemies. This will be accomplished by developing revoluti onary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more c ohesive group action by our forces. Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated coordinated decision support, information sh aring, and ensured communications. Cogn itive decision support tools reason about t asks, timings, and interactions so that when plans change or the enemy does not respond as anticipated, U.S. forces can quickly adapt. The qualit y of such decisions and the effectiveness of our actions depend cr itically on our ability to take full adva ntage of all available information in a rapid and flexible manner. This requires the capability to sh are information and to automatically inte grate distributed information bases for bro ad tactical battlespace awareness. Finally, team cohesion requir es effective and reliable communication in difficult environments such as an urban set ting where radio signal propagation is complex. Here the a pproach is to develop cognitive communicati ons management and control algorithms that reason about channel conditions, higher-level application connectivity requirements and related factors, and decide (often as a group) what parameters (e.g., frequency) each radio will use. The suite of programs under th is project will significantly ad vance the military's ability to address and deal with complex situations in operational environments.

Such situations typically require multiple coordinated tasks that involve information sharing and cooperative efforts. The Co llaborative Cognition program will foster the design and implementa tion of collaborative software agents that operate in dynamic environmen ts, and include both software agents and people. Applications include collaborative surveillance and reconnaissance, logistics re-planning and decision suppor t for unanticipated operational changes , situational analysis, prediction tools, and warfighter/commander decision aids. The technology will also allow software agents to cope wit h limited and/or noisy sensor information, limited communication capabilities, ch anging and unforeseen environments , other agents, and limited a priori knowledge of each others capabilities. The Collaborative Cognition program consists of two efforts: Coordination Decision-Supp ort Assistants (COORDINATORs), and Advanced Soldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST). The Coordination Decision-Support Assistants (COORDINATORs) effort will develop cognitive software coordination managers that provide support to fielded tactical teams. The coordination ma nagers will help fielded units adapt their mission plans in resp onse to inevitable, unanticipated changes in the mission by tracking pers onnel, resources, situational ch anges, and proposing and evalu ating options (adjustments to task timings, changes to task assignme nts and selection from pre-planned contingencies). This will ena ble fielded units to respond faster and more accurately to the dynamica lly changing battlefield situation, requiring far fewer personnel in the re- planning process. COORDINATORs is a distributed technology. A single COORDINATOR will be partnered with each tactical unit or team, and will be able to collaborate and coordinate with other tactical un its to optimize needed mission changes. A key lesson learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) is the importance of accurate observationa l reporting by ground soldier s. The Advanced Soldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST) effort will develop an integrated information system that exploits soldier-worn sensors to augment the soldier's ability to capture, report, and share information in the field. Communi cation of timely and accurate information is vital for enhanced situa tional understanding and overall ope rational effectiveness in urban combat and post-conflict stability operations. While a range of standardized reporting mechanisms are in use today, the confusion of the 92UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 19 of 28 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 battlefield/urban operations combined with ph ysical and psychological stresses on the warfighters can make the task of reportin g very difficult. Furthermore, existing verbal and text-format reports limit the soldier's ability to capture and convey the full pic ture, particularly annotated visual information. The ASSIST effort will develop an integrated system using advanced technologies for processing, digitizing and analyzing information captured and collected by soldier-wor n sensors. It will draw heavily on the experiences and lessons learned from previous OIF missions and other surv eillance and reconnaissance missions. A baseline system will demonstrate the capture of video/still images together with voice annotations and location-stam ping. The advanced system will demonstrate automatic ident ification and extraction of key objects, events, activities and scenes from so ldier-collected data. The sy stem will create knowledge rep resentations that will serve as an input to an array of warfighter products in cluding augmented maps, situati onal analysis tools, and query and answer capabilities. (U) Program Plans: Coordination Decision-Support Assistants (COORDINATORs) FY 2007 Accomplishments: -- Developed distributed coordination technol ogy that reasons about making changes to task timings, assignments, and selection from pre-planned contingencies. -- Tested coordination algorithms in a lab setting on large- scale coordination problems (100 COORDINATORs, 10,000 mission tasks), and demonstrated that algorithms achieve nearly optimal results in seconds. -- Developed a meta-cognition technology that reasons about res ource allocation (i.e., where a given COORDINATOR should spend its processing time), so the entire system can engage in difficult processing tasks but still respond in real time. -- Developed a Commander's COORDINATOR that can selectively \"drill down\" into portions of the mission structure and collect up-to-the-minute information, enabling a comma nder to make adjustments or recommendations.

(U) Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Cognitive Networking 20.523 30.986 25.263 (U) The Cognitive Networking research program will develop technologi es that provide information systems and communication networks with the ability to maintain their own functionality, reliab ility and survivability. These technologies will allow the militar y to focus its critical manpower resources on the mission rather than on the maintenance of its information systems and network infrastructure. Resear ch in this area will create a radical new design for distributed computers, device networks, and the software to manage these systems. Cogniti ve information processing will be used to optimize networked communications based on current conditions, past experience and high-level user g uidance. The Cognitive Networking program comprises three efforts: Situation-Aware Protocols in E dge Network Technologies, Local Area Networ k droid, and Brood of Spectrum Supremacy. The Situation-Aware Protocols in Edge Network Technologies (SAPIENT) effort will develop a new generation of cognitive protocol architectures to replace conventional protocols that fare poorly in extreme network conditions a nd do not provide adequate serv ice for key applications. Technology developed in the SAPIENT effort will have military utility wh erever tactical communications are deplo yed. 95UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 22 of 28 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 SAPIENT architectures will represent awareness with a knowledge base that is updated based on specification and observation. T his technology enables the automatic adaptation of protocols to the operational environment. SAPIENT will exploit attributes of hu man cognition, such as learning and self-improveme nt, and apply them to the automated cons truction of network protocols. Key resea rch challenges for the SAPIENT effort are the u se of these cognitive attributes to dramatic ally reduce the effect of network impair ments on applications while demonstrating a positive trend in this capability as new situations are encountered and learned. Desired ca pabilities include interoperable knowledge representati ons and rapid incorporation of new knowle dge about applications, network conditions and building blocks from which new protocols can be constructed . The Local Area Network droid (LANdroid) effort will give warfigh ters reliable communications in urban settings. LANdroid will accomplish this by creating robotic radio relay nodes that move autonomously to configure and maintain a communications mesh by reasoning about their positions relative to one another and relative to the warfighters. LANdroids will also move as the warfi ghters move - keeping them covered with communications throughout their ope rations. LANdroids will be pocket-sized so warfighters can carr y several and drop or deploy them as they move through a given ar ea. The effort is creating both the intelligent radio control s oftware and the small radio platforms on which it runs. The technologies will be tested in a physical setting (i.e., not simulated) and at an operationally relevant scale. The Brood of Spectrum Supremacy (BOSS) effort will provide actiona ble situational awareness to th e warfighter in complex radio frequency (RF) environments. BOSS adds co llaborative processing capabilities to tactical software-defined radios to achieve sp ecific military goals. BOSS exploits cooperative u se of computational, communication and sen sory capabilities in a software radio, in aggregate, to generate breakthrough capab ilities in the warfighter knowledge of their surroundings, with a particular focus on RF-rich urban operations. The BOSS effort will in itially focus on modeling and simulation, r esulting in hardware-independent executabl e specifications of waveforms in an interoperable format. Once the modeling and simulation is verified, the BOSS effort will dev elop a prototype demonstration for a performer-sel ected RF platform, using and refining the hardware-independent executable specificat ions of the waveforms. Ultimately this effort will develop Software Communications Architect ure (SCA)-compliant waveforms suitable for implementation on a tactical software radio system. 96UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 23 of 28 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 (U) Program Plans: Situation-Aware Protocols in Edge Network Technologies (SAPIENT) FY 2007 Accomplishments: -- Created knowledge representations appropriate for describing some situations encounter ed in tactical military networks (e.g., weak signals, propagation obstruc tions, message priorities and security requirement s) and for enabling machine response to thes e situations. -- Demonstrated SAPIENT capabilities in laboratory venues. -- Evaluated the impact of mobility on communications.

The current in ability to share and integrate data and information results in a fragmented picture of the battlespace where only a fr action of the available information is actually used. The pr oblem has been raised by numerous DoD and service studies as well as by Combatant Commande rs themselves. The Integrated Collective Systems program w ill enable warfighters to take full advantage of all available pertinent info rmation in a rapid and flexible manner. It will create softw are technologies that enable future warfighters to share informa tion and to automatically integrate distributed information bases for broad tactical battlespace awareness. Ultimately, the selection, generation, shari ng, integration and display of information will be handled by cognitive software sy stems coupled with each warfighter, and as information is shared the network of indi vidual systems will form a collective. Integration of multime dia (text, video, digital photographs) is of particular interest as it may contai n valuable intelligence \"tidbits\" with different degrees of subt lety that can be extremely time-consuming to manually analyze (this is the case toda y). Once analyzed, such data needs to be indexed and stored so it can be queried and retrieved. Automatic analysis , querying and correlation algorithms need to be developed to minimize manual interve ntion. The Integrated Collective Systems program consists of two efforts: Digital Network Archive (DNA) and Data Integration and Exploitat ion SystEm that Learns (DIESEL). Current practices in the area of digital storage and information management generally optimize file storage and retrieval for t he individual but are poorly suited to the sharing of large volumes of digita l information across workgroups and enterprises. The Digital Ne twork Archive (DNA) effort is pursuing a network-based approach to in formation storage and management that will enable a network-base d repository to hold all digital information. Because it resides on the network, the DNA repository will provide a mechanism for the virtual (i.e., logical, not physical) centralization of all enterprise in formation. DNA technology will enable and facilitate controll ed access to information by approved and authenticated users across administrati ve domains, and in this fashion it will enable a collective view of enterprise information. Repositories built on DNA technology will, in addition, provide a single distributed platform/framewor k for additional document/content/information services including indexing, metada ta creation, search, versioning, and records managem ent, resulting in the warfighter's ability to take full advantage of a ll available pertinent information in a rapid and flexible man ner. 99UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 26 of 28 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 Today's warfighters are overwhelmed with info rmation, but have difficulty finding and integrating the right fragments of data t hey need from the vast array of disparate data sources available. M ilitary systems including command and control, intelligence, informa tion assurance, special operations, maintenance and logistics are pla gued by non-integrated, heterogeneous, legacy information syste ms. The Data Integration and Exploitation SystEm that Learns (DIESEL) ef fort will develop a new suite of information integration techni ques for the warfighter. The fundamental problem is that information sy stems are, necessarily, developed independently using different software conventions, data types, semantic models and assumptions about their use. All of these \"stovepipe\" systems come together at ma ny levels of command, where they must interoperate and share data. A new suite of intelligent information integration tools are needed - ones that could learn to automatically ingest and understand new information systems as they occur and learn to semi-automatically map/integrate those new systems into the existing information environment. R ecent developments in web services, DAML, and the Semantic Web h ave created the right infrastructure on which to develop this information integration tec hnology.

Past successes in this effort have come from developing therapeutics that are des igned to work against broad classes of pathogens. This has led to several significant transitions, a separate thrust in Anthrax countermeasu res, and most recently a program at Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) that direc tly capitalizes on previous DARPA investments.

(U) The overall goal of DARPA's Handheld Isotherm al Silver Standard Sensor (HISSS) program was to develop a sensor that is capable of detecting the entire biological warfare threat spectrum (bacteria , DNA viruses, RNA viruses and protein toxins) with the same \" silver standard\" specificity as current laboratory techniques, but in a fast, relia ble, handheld unit. Today, this standard is achieved for DNA and RNA threats using polymerase chain reaction, which is slow because of the associated temperature cycling. For proteins, the standard is met usin g Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), which requires skilled laboratory t echnicians to complete. The equipment required for these tests is bulky and difficult to use under field conditions. Under HISSS, DARPA was to develop fundamentally new ways to exploit previously develo ped identification mechanisms (DNA and RNA primer s, protein antibodies) in an integrated, isothermal system that will allow a singl e, handheld sensor to detect the full range of BW threats. (U) The Spectral Sensing of Bio-Aerosols (SSBA) program involved th e active probing of bioaerosols with electromagnetic (EM) energy , which holds the promise of extremely fast, and potentially long-ra nge, detection and identification of bio agents. Only a smal l portion of the EM spectrum is exploited in today's trigger sensors (e.g., optically based particle sizers, sometimes enhanced with fluorescence m easurements). However, anecdotal evidence suggests that other portions of the spectrum may offer substantial improvement in trigger sensors, as well as potentially agent-specific discrimination capability. Various types of spectra in the visible, infrared, and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths were measured for prototype systems development. Additional spect ral information such as UV fluorescence lifetime and single partic le mass spectroscopy was also evaluated. An aeros ol testbed has been developed to provide calibrated exposures of threat agent simulan ts and complex clutter mixtures for sensor performance evaluation. (U) The goal of the Femtosecond Adaptive Spectro scopy Techniques for Remote Agent Detection (FASTREAD) program is to provide a capability to detect biological agents at standoff distances. This goal will be accomplished by performing coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy, laser pulse shaping techniques, and adaptive optics coupled to strategies that optimize the return signal from the agent under interrogation.

(U) The RealWorld program exploits technical i nnovation and integration to provide any U.S. warfighter with the ability to open a l aptop computer and rehearse a specific mission in the relevant geo-speci fic terrain, with realistic physics. Because the system will be scalable and distributed, warfighters can practice by themselves, in small gr oups, or with as many other warfighters as needed for the missi on over a local or distributed network, and across all relevant platforms (dismounts, vehicles, helicopters, fast movers). Most important is the understanding that RealWorld is not a simulation; it is a simulation builder with applications across the spectrum of modern kinetic and non-kinet ic warfare. The program is building tools that allow warfighters to rapidly a nd easily build their own missions though the introduction of new methodology for building simulation software. These methodologies and adherence to a highly modular approach will cause a fundamental paradigm shift in the acquisition, as well as the construction, of DoD modeling and simulation products.

Current technology uses natural stars or an artificial star (called a \"guide star\") to provide a reference image from which the effects of the atmosp here can be computed and cancelled.

These techniques have been utili zed to successfully demonstrate strategi es for wavefront compensation, but suffer from practical restrictions limiting operational utility. Rayleigh guide stars can be effectively generated to altitudes of 15 - 20 km, beyon d which decreasing air densities reduce the backscatter to the poin t where unrealistic laser powers are required for useful return signal.

The goal of the Helico pter Quieting Program (HQP) is to identify, develop and demonstrate advanced rotor technologies that can dramatically improve the survivabili ty of military rotor systems, with minimal negative impact on performance, a ffordability, availability and suitability. A critical element to ward this goal is to create and demonstrate a physics-based design toolset that enabl es analytical design of novel rotor systems and rotorcraft for reduced acoustic susceptibility (detection and recognition) by the human threat.

This approach to nozzle integration results in h eavy, high maintenance nozzles and is struct urally inefficient. It also poses a sig nificant engine integration challenge and can dr ive vehicle sizing. A fully integrated nozzle, designed to take airframe loads through the noz zle, and built of a high temperature ceramic, would address the weight and structural in tegration problems directly. Th is approach would also be c ompatible with fluidic thrust vectoring and would result in a more compact, light er, and more durable nozzle.

The landing field requirement for a fixed wing aircraft limits use in both confined (e.g. urban) and remote unprepared areas. This program sought to explore unsteady aerodynamics during rapid pitch up or flare landing maneuvers. It is known that very high lift coefficients c an be obtained for a short period of time during such a maneuver. The technical cha llenge was to develop the aero structures, control effectors and control logic that would allow for a practical application of this phenomenon to a fi xed wing aircraft to enable landing in a very short distance.

Mission applications include signal processing, de tection, tracking, identification, situation understanding, p lanning, and control functions. These applications will integrat e: (1) external sensors and processors th at provide data on targets and mission con texts; (2) external platforms, both air and surface, that deliver sensors and m unitions to designated areas; (3 ) intelligence processing systems at all levels of command; and (4) external communications ne tworks that provide connectivity between computing nodes located on the platforms, a t field command centers, and headquarters. The mission applications shar e data to form consistent battlespace understanding tailored t o the needs of commanders at each node. The types of tailoring include common operational pictures, timelines, and resource usage description s. The mission applications also negotiate plans for futu re operations based on mission needs presented at each node. To maintain focus on op erationally relevant problems, the project's technical goals are posed and ev aluated in the context of mixed manned/unmanned forces. (U) Technologies developed in this project enable localized and distributed collaborative pr ocessing. This allows networks of sens ors to rapidly adapt to changing force mixes, communications connectiv ity, and mission objectives. The technology developed permits t he distributed command and intelligence systems to effectivel y collaborate in a dynamic environment. Technologies are demonstrated and evalua ted in the laboratory and in hardware-in-the-loop demons trations. Demonstrations employ both sta tionary and autonomous mobile platforms. Operational benefits are: (1) smaller forward deployme nt of image and signal analysts in comp lex operating conditions including urban battl efields; (2) deeper understanding of the evolving stability and support operational envi ronment; (3) consistent integra tion of target and environme nt information; and (4) flexible operational tactics and procedures to find evasive targets in difficult environments.

NEST is the key software building block needed to enab le ad-hoc or structured wireless sensor networks to function to gether. Applications of these systems include: localization of snipers by collaborative sensor fusion in real time (i.e., within two se conds), sensor network- based tripwires and chokepoints for detection and discrimination of personnel and vehicles, and wide-area, 24/7 surveillance of long linear structures, (i.e., pipelines and borders). These applications requi re from tens to tens of thousands of nodes. NEST produces reusable software libraries and design tools that simplify the developm ent of wireless sensor network applications. (U) In particular, this technology is being combined with an active exciter to develop a radar-like sensor system to measure human activity inside buildings. The approach exploits existing wiring networks (power) to provide persistent surveillance of buildings and b elow grade areas. The concept is to insert radar pulses into a building's main power feed and read pul se returns from a wireless network of senso rs placed around the building. The building's own wiring network serves as a tran smission line to conduct these pulses throughout a structure, and every outlet or switch serves as an antenna to couple these radar waves to and from free-space.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Combat Zones That See (CZTS) 5.000 7.000 6.000 (U) The Combat Zones That See (CZTS) program improves the situationa l awareness, effectiveness, and safety of U.S. military forces in foreign urban environments (e.g., Mozul). CZTS provides cl ose-in sensing and extended reconnaissance capabilities using a netw ork of video sensors. The system tracks vehicles over urban areas using sparse arrays of video cameras, automatically detecting vehicles th at may be involved in hostile activities based on the observed tracks. This networ k produces an extreme amount of raw data, precluding human anal ysis, so advanced video understanding algorithms embedded in commercial-off-the-shelf hardware systems monitor the video feeds automatically. As processing requirements become well understood, novel image-processing chips w ill be integrated and interleaved with focal plane arrays wi thin a conventional camera architecture, and a fully-compatible communi cations link developed to support a video-based system for peri meter defense. CZTS will enable vehicle identification with a 10,000-fold reduc tion in the bandwidth required to transmit key data across the camera network and will provide the capability to track vehicles non-continuously acro ss extended distances. The CZTS goal is to demonstrate tech nology packaged into a flexible ground-deployed system.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Automated Battle Management 13.400 20.418 20.328 (U) The pace of battle will continue to increase as more-capable platforms and higher-bandwidth communication networks become operational. While experienced commanders are required to fo rmulate strategy and select tactics, the increased operational tem po will demand more automation of low-level decision processes, such as route-find ing, weapon/target pairing, and sensor scheduling. Some ele ments of these processes, such as collision avoidance and na vigation, will be embedded in each platform . However, groups of platforms will be able to execute cooperative tactics to achieve coordinated effects. This cross-platform coordina tion and synchronization requires new technolo gies that can carry out aggregate maneuvers and tasks, while le veraging the functions embedded in each plat form. This program is developing novel technologies for multi-platform, automated battle management at the tactical level, in the air, on the ground, and within mobile sensor networks . (U) The Collaborative Networked Autonomous Vehicles (CNAV) progra m will be the primary demons tration of Automated Battle Management Techniques. It will develop autonomous control me thods to cause a distributed set of unmanned undersea vehicles to self-organize and distribute tasks through judicious transactions conveyed ove r a shared communications network. CNAV will utilize these cap abilities to provide submerged target detection, loca lization, and tracking in restrictive littora l waters. CNAV provides this capability b y creating a field of dozens or hundreds of vehicles, networked through acoustic wire less communications. The vehicles work collaboratively and auto nomously to detect, classify, localize and track target submarines transiting the field. The field self-organ izes to adapt to changes in t arget locations, environmental conditions, and operational factors.

It provides 3-D situational awareness with sufficient detail and accuracy to remove the \"home field advantage\" enjoyed by oppone nts. Detailed mobility maps to support gr ound vehicle routing will be inferred and generated, and detailed visibility data to support sensor positioning will then be derived to maximize coverage and minimize detectability. H igh fidelity baselines will be created to support change detection to cue searches for targets and anticipate changes due to current or impending mete orological events. The program will supply real-time context information to sensor managers, maneuver controllers, weapons operators, and commande rs. Furthermore, the program will filter natural change from artific ial change indicative of human (threat) activity and permit ope ration of military forces in hostile terrain normally deemed fa vorable to opponents because of their histor ical familiarity with hide points, sigh t lines, and mobility characteristics. 189UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 16 Page 76 of 84 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Technology PE 0602702E, Project TT-13 (U) Drawing upon technologies developed in the Home Field program, the Urban Photonic Sandtable Display (UPSD) program develops revolutionary interactive holographic displays for complex volum etric 3-D data to replace current 3-D visualization technologie s that are either static or have limited effective field- of-view. Current technologies include traditional holography, computer graphics on mensional (2-D) screens, slice stacking, parallax autostero, and goggles/glasses. These techniques not only give a poor image quality and poor movement, they also are not created quickly and do not allow for collaborative vi ewer interaction. The desire to improve these components has launched the development of the UPSD. A monochrome active hogel-based proof-o f-concept display and further de veloped module have been valid ated by transforming computer data to optical data, making sophisticated integration possible to optimize image quality. The UPSD prog ram will develop an affordable 3-D display that operates at full video rate, displays RGB color, in creases viewing angle, and increases display size. The result will be the world's first full-motion, full aspect 3-D imaging technology system.

Implicit in this thrust is the fact that there are unique, warfighter-specific challenges in acute and chronic treatment that are not addressed by civilian research and development. Tod ay, more than half of American battlefield fatalities are due to hemorrhage, particul arly due to improvised explosive devices (IEDs). To prevent these deaths, there is an urgent need for technologies that enable relatively unskille d personnel (battlefield medics) to diagnose and treat injuries, including the ability to locate and coagulate non-compressible deep bleed ers in the thorax or abdomen. Other criti cal needs stem from the fact that war fighters are frequently victims of blasts, causing patterns of brain, burn, and orthopedic injuries not seen in civilian medical practice. As such, there is a unique military need to develop systems for pain control that ar e safe even in medically unmonito red environments, such as an a ctive battlefield. 229UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 17 Page 32 of 42 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Materials & Biological Technology PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02 Once lives are saved, there is an unmet need for new methods to restore function, for example, by restoring long segments of bo ne that were lost due to blast fragmentation.

(U) The Neuroscience Technologies thrust leverag es recent advances in neurophysiology, ne uro-imaging, cognitive science and molecul ar biology to sustain and protect the cognitive functioning of th e warfighter faced with challenging operational conditions. Warf ighters experience a wide variety of operational stresses, both mental and physical, that degrade critical cognitive functions such as memory, learn ing and decision making. Currently, the long-term impact of these stressors on th e brain is unknown, both at the molecular and behavioral level . This thrust area will utilize modern neuroscientific techniques to develop quantitative models of this impact and explore mechanisms to protect and restore cognitive functioning following operational stressors. For example, molecular targets for the restoration of long term memory using micro- ribonucleic acids (mi-RNA) will be tested in animal models for their efficacy following stress and training.

Currently, heterogeneous integr ation of compound semiconductors w ith silicon is typically achieved through the use of multi-chi p modules and similar assemblies.

At the other end of the spectrum, epitaxial m ethods to grow III-V materials onto silicon substrates have gene rally proven unsatisfactory due to high de fect densities, cost, and inflexibility in supporting multiple technologies. Instead, COSMOS will focus on an intermediate appr oach, which is likely to be th e most successful strategy in te rms of performance, size and cost.

The frequency response of directly modulated se miconductor lasers has been limited by the relaxation oscillation to ~ 40 GHz. This fundamental limit can be overcome by strong optical injection locking as demonstrated recently i n vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) and edge-emitting distributed feedb ack (DFB) lasers with enhanced resonance frequencies of 50 a nd 72 GHz, respectively. These are the highest ever re ported for such lasers. Despite the impr essive experimental demonstrations, the fu ndamental limit of such frequency enhancement was not well unders tood until very recently. A newly derived analytical expression for the maximum enhanced resonance frequency shows that it is proportional to the square r oot of the external injection ratio, and inversely proportiona l to the photon lifetime of the slave laser cavity. This new understanding makes it possibl e to engineer the resonance fre quency and to design monolith ically integrated laser structures with a tailored radio frequency (RF) response.

These two t echnologies are required in order to make inverse synthetic aperture LADAR systems feasible for objects in geostationary orbits. The Long View technology will transition to the Air Force in 2012. (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Designed and began assembling the stab le optical reference oscillator.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Falcon 51.500 25.000 25.000 (U) The Falcon program objectives are to develop and demonstrate hype rsonic technologies that will enable prompt global reach missi ons. This capability is envisioned to entail a reusable Hypersonic Cr uise Vehicle (HCV) capable of delivering 12,000 pounds of paylo ad at a distance of 9,000 nautical miles from CONUS in less than two hours. The technologies required by a HCV include high lift-to-drag techno logies, high temperature materials, thermal protection sy stems, and guidance, navigation, and cont rol. Leveraging technology developed unde r the Hypersonic Flight (HyFly) program, Falcon will address the implications of hypersonic flight and reusability using a series of hypersonic technology vehicles (HTVs) to incrementally demonstrate these required technologies in flight. The HTV-2 program will demonstrate enabling hyperso nic technologies for future operational systems through rocket-booste d hypersonic flights with suffi cient cross-range and downrange performance to evaluate thermal protection systems, ae rodynamic shapes, maneuverability, and long -range communication for hypersonic cruise an d re-entry vehicle applications. The HTV-3X program will demonstrate key Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle technologies in a realistic flight env ironment by developing a re-usable hypersonic aircraft test bed capable of takeoff from runway under turbojet power, acceleration to Mach 6 speed under combined turbojet and scramjet propulsion, controlled deceleration, and runway landings. In order to implement this flight tes t program in an affordable manner, Falcon will develop a lo w-cost, responsive Small Launch Vehicle (SLV ). The SLV will be capable of launching small satellites into low earth and sun-synchro nous orbits and will provide the nation a new, small payload access to space capabilit y. Thus, the Falcon program addresses many high priority mission areas and applicati ons such as global presence and space lift. DARPA established an MOA with the Air Force for the HTV-2 program in May 2003 and with NAS A in October 2004. Falcon capabilities are planned for transition to the Air Force. (U) An MOA with the Air Force in FY 2007 established the HTV-3X Black swift Test Bed program. Given the importance of this activity , the HTV-3X Blackswift Test Bed has been separately budge ted in FY 2008 and out in this Program Element. 314UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 32 Page 9 of 24 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Space Programs and Technology PE 0603287E, Project SPC-01 (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Conducted a second demonstration SLV launch.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Sleight of HAND (SOH) 9.636 12.710 17.045 (U) The effects of High Altitude Nuclear Detonations (HAND) are catas trophic to satellites. HAND-generated charged particles are t rapped for very long periods of time, possibly for years, oscillating be tween the earth's north and sout h magnetic poles. This enhanc ed radiation environment would immediately degrade low earth orbiting (LEO) sp acecraft capability and result in their destruction within a f ew weeks. The Sleight of HAND (SOH) program is a proof-of-concept demonstrati on of the technology and techniques to rapidly mitigate the HAND -enhanced trapped radiation within days of a HAND ev ent, before LEO spacecraft capabilities are degraded. Other slower remediation metho ds, taking weeks versus days, would result in spacecr aft degradation and would require asset repl acement. The SOH effort will explore two alternative approaches to radiation mitigation: 1) usi ng ground transmitted very low frequency (VLF) transmissions to interact with trapped particles and 2) using neutral gas release in space to generate plasma interac tions producing ultra low frequency (ULF)/VLF energy to interact w ith trapped particles. Following laboratory proof-of-concept experiments and a risk reduction sounding rocket flight, a space-based demons tration will be pursued as a pathfinder for a future progra m in space remediation capability.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 RAD Hard by Design 5.000 4.220 4.705 (U) This program is developing, characterizing, and demonstrating microelectronic design t echnologies to enable fabrication of radi ation hardened electronic components using leading-edge, commercial fabr ication facilities. The current mainstream approach for fabr icating radiation- hardened electronics depends on specialized process technologies a nd dedicated foundries that serve this military market niche. While commercial semiconductor fabrication is not explicitly radiation hardened, recent trends in deeply scaled fabrication such as very thin ox ides, trench isolation, and multiple levels of metal are resulting in semiconductor devices th at are inherently more tolerant of radiation than older g enerations. This program is pursuing development of design-based technologies that will enable pure commercial fabrication technologies to attai n radiation hardened electronics equivalent to those from the dedicated foundries. The design t echnology developed under the Radiation Har dening by Design program is planned for transition to the Air Force and to the Defense Threat Reduction Agen cy (DTRA) at the end of Phase II, which is anticipated to be completed by FY 2009. Specific design libraries for hardened ci rcuits will transition through the defense el ectronics design industry, which are being supported largely by DTRA and the Air Force. 317UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 32 Page 12 of 24 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Space Programs and Technology PE 0603287E, Project SPC-01 (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Developed a Rad Hard by Design (RHBD) sta ndard cell Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) library in a commercial 90 nanometer (nm) complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process.

The program will integrate a variety of advanced technologies, which have not been previously flight-tested, and may include: lightweight optical space surveillance/situational awareness sens ors, lightweight power, chemical and electric propulsion syste ms, advanced lightweight structures, advanced miniature radio frequency (RF) technology including micro crosslink and use of commercial off the shelf (COTS) approaches, active RF sensor technology, COTS processor and softwa re environment, miniature navigation technologies, including the use of 318UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 32 Page 13 of 24 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Space Programs and Technology PE 0603287E, Project SPC-01 starfields for deep space navigation, and autonomous operations. The developed capab ilities will include high thrust, high eff iciency solar thermal propulsion systems that can enable responsive orbit transfer as well as provide radiation resistant high-density electrical pow er. The program will also explore ultra-stable payload isolation and pointing systems and components to enable advanced miniature communication syst ems. In addition, the program will also consider affordable, responsive fabrication and integration appr oaches and the possibility of n etworking microsatellites/modules to create a flexible architecture of assets responsive to multiple missions and threats. If successful , MiDSTEP will demonstrate these technologies in space. The anticipat ed transition partner is Air Force Space Command.

Current large space sy stems used for national security purposes are constrained due to their monolithic architecture. They can be launched only on a small number of la rge launch vehicles, cannot readily be upgraded and/or reconfigured with new hardwa re on-orbit, and are risk-intensive, since the unforgiving launch and space environm ents can result in a total loss of investment with one mista ke. The System F6 will partition the tasks performed by monolithic spacecraft (power , receivers, control modules, etc.) and assign each task to a dedicated small or micro satellite. This fractionated space system offers the pot ential for reduced risk, greater flexibility (e.g. simplified on -orbit servicing, reconfigurability to meet changing mission needs), payload isol ation, faster deployment of initial capability, and potential fo r improved survivability. This program will develop, design, and test new space system architectures and technologies required to success fully decompose a spacecraft into fundamental elements. Such architectures include , but are not limited to, ultra-secure intra-system wireless d ata communications, wireless power systems, electromagnetic formation flying systems, remote attitude determination systems, structure-less optical and RF arrays, distributed spacecraft computing systems, and reliable, robust, rapidly re-locatable ground systems. The anticipated transitio n partner is the Air Force. (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Conducted system design trades of appropriate technologies and system architectures.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 14.400 (U) goal of the Front-end Robotics Enabling Near-term Demonstration (FREND) program is to develop, demonstrate and fly robotic manipulator technologies designed to allow interaction with ge osynchronous orbit (GEO)-based military and commercial spacecraft , extending their service lives and permitting satellite repositioning or retirem ent. Existing GEO spacecraf t are outfitted with sufficien t propellant to provide for needed station keeping, repositioning, and retirement maneuvers, which in many cases defines their useful mission durations . Once this propellant is expended, the vehicle is retired and, in many cases replaced. FREN D technologies can enable significant service extension to these spacecraft through re-boosting near end-of-life. FREND combines detailed stereo photogrammetric imaging with robotic multi-deg ree-of-freedom manipulators to autonomously grapple space objects not outfitted with custom interfaces.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST) 4.300 7.000 12.000 (U) The goal of the Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST) program is to demonstrate a suite of critical technologies required to pe rform rapid orbital repositioning in the geosynchronous belt. The ultim ate goal of FAST is to demonstrate technology to enable a hig h-efficiency, high- power (50-80 kW), fast-transfer roaming satellite permitting on-demand access to any poin t on the geosynchronous ring or within the high- altitude, super synchronous \"graveyard\" (where derelict system s are regularly repositioned in order to free up orbital slots wi thin the ring), greatly improving our space situational awareness capabilities. The FA ST demonstrator satellite, while possessing high power (20 kW or more), would be revolutionary in its small size. At just 500 kilograms, a FAST spacecraft would carry a novel solar power collection and distr ibution system, composed of large-aperture (5-10 m diameter) rrors, high-efficiency solar photovoltaics, and ultra-lightweight, deployable radiators, achieving specific power (130 watts/kilogram at the power subsystem level) figures an order of magnitude better than today's state of the art. The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force. (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Conducted system design trades and investigated utility of applicable power and propulsion technologies.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 NanoPayload Delivery (NPD) 0.000 3.000 6.000 (U) The goal of the NanoPayload Delivery (NPD) program is to valid ate the technical feasibility of ultra-lightweight, rapid-respons e spacecraft delivery from land, sea, or air-based platforms. Such nanopayloads (1-10 kilograms) could be boosted to low earth o rbit (200 km altitude) in a matter of hours following call-up. Multiple sorties are envisioned, enabling a number of small spacecraft to be placed in an orbit \"box\" and aggregated together to perform a mission. The NPD pr ogram will develop and test a light weight rocket platform simila r in size to existing small missile systems such as the High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), AI M-7, or AIM-120. Current technology doe s not permit such small systems to reach orbit, owing to disproportionately high drag and low thrust-to-weight rocket engines. NPD will lev erage ongoing technology development efforts, which permit the fabrication of mi croscale pumps, thrust chambers, and valves. Such rocket eng ines, which are theoretically capable of thrust-to-weight ratios of 100:1 or greater, would allow for significant reductions in overall engine mass and permit nanosatellites to be placed in low orbits fo r several weeks to months. The delivery sy stem would rely on one of several method s for launch, including: (1) a stock aircraft, such as the F-15E or F-16, (2) a truck-mounted erector, or (3) the deck of a small naval vesse l. The goal for per- sortie cost is $100,000. Fielding NPD will permit U.S. forces to rapidly emplace short-term capabilities in low orbit, when th ey are needed, without resorting to legacy domestic launch systems that are size d and costed for much larger pa yloads. NPD will also allow ma ny non-traditional users (e.g. laboratories, operational commanders, and small commerc ial firms) the capability to \"use space\" by lowering the sig nificant barrier to entry into space. NPD will allow a stre amlined, inexpensive approach to launch, descoping lengthy test and documentation requi rements and demanding far fewer engineers, technicians, range personnel, and spacecraft operators pe r mission. Potential transition custom ers include the Air Force and Navy.

For space radar systems, th is has traditionally meant that SAR had to be accomplished at l ow earth orbit (LEO) trajectories where the collection time would be much shorter given the high speeds of a LEO satellite. Although the specifics depend heavily on geometric considerations, medium earth orbit (MEO) SAR imaging in tervals can be a factor of approximately eight longer, compare d to a LEO alternative. The longer integration times required at MEO can have a major impact on the quality of the otherwise equivalent S AR image due to the presence of internal motion within the im age scene. To achieve equivalent qualit y imagery, the contribution of the moving targets within the image must be excised. The MEOSAR program will develop techniqu es to identify moving targets and extract them from the data pr ior to imaging to avoid the streaking caused by their motions. The pr ogram will develop reliable automated detection of moving target s within SAR imagery using a double thresholding process in interferometric phase and amplitude. Th is moving target detection technique can be readily reversed to excise the moving targets from the clutter (image) background. Temporal sub-array processing will demonstrate earl y detection and rejection of moving targets in sub-array images. The program will develop improved motion det ection and removal algorithms, de monstrate their performance on simulated and airborne data, a nd develop an architectural concept for a MEOSAR system. This program will transi tion to the Air Force and STRATCOM in FY 2013.

Using the satellite omni antennas to serve as bi-static receive rs, reflections from intruder satellites could be detected up to 10km from GEO spacecraft by extracting the very weak bi-static illumination si gnals reflected off the intruder satellites. Use of existing s atellite TT&C transmit antennas to generate a bi-static EM shield would provide a very important situational awareness capabilty without the need for additional on-orbit assets around individual satellites.

Micromechanical RF switches are of particular interest, where sizable power throughputs and impacting ope ration constitute harsh operationa l environments. Other applications such as vibrating reso nator reference tanks, gyroscopes, and accelerometers are also of interest. Am ong the HERMIT implementation approaches deemed likely to succee d are two of most interest: 1) wafer-level encapsulation or packaging strate gies based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology t hat isolate a micromechanical device from its surroundings while maintaining a desired environment via passive or active control; or 2) mater ial and design engineering strategies that render a micromechanical device impervi ous to its environment, with or without a package (if possib le). A key approach in this program that should allow orders of magnitude power savings is to selectively control only the needed micro-sc ale environment or volume via MEMS-enabled isolation technologies. The success of th is program should enable a myriad of strategic capabilities i ncluding lower cost, more complex phased array antennas for radar applications ; tiny frequency references with long- and short-term stabilitie s that greatly extend the portability of ultra-secure communications; and micro-scale inertial measurement units with bias stabilities approaching na vigation-grade. The HERMIT program is anticipated to transition via industry to phased array antenna, reconfigur able communication front-end, seeke r, and steerable aperture programs being developed by the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as to inertial navigation systems and Joint Tactica l Radio System (JTRS) communications needed by these Services.

The key to making this possible is the use of technologi es capable of isolating channels (not bands, but channels wi th <0.05% bandwidth) directly after the antenna, removing all out-of- channel interferers before they arrive at the low noise amplifier (LNA)/ADC input, 348UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 46 Page 19 of 50 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Advanced Electronics Technology PE 0603739E, Project MT-12 hence substantially relaxing the dynamic range required by the L NA/ADC to achieve a given receiver jam-resistance. In essence, the removal of all interferers by the channelizer allows the ADC to operate w ithout the need to reject strong interferers, thereby without the need for a high dynamic range. This allows the use of fewer bits, making it possible for the ADC to handle GHz input frequencies without exces sive power consumption.

(U) The Microsensors for Imaging (MISI) program establishes technology for extremely small, lightweight cameras sensitive in the sh ort wave infrared for a wide range of applica tions. MISI is initially focused on two important areas, micro-air vehicles and a hea d-mounted system. The camera components comprise a micro-system including optics, focal plane arra y and electronics with display, energy source a nd illuminator included as the head-mounted system. The limitation of weight and power places demands on the sensor technology for exceptiona l image quality in a micro-package. This technology will have many DoD applicat ions. In the micro-air vehicle application, the weight goal is ten (10) grams, (including the optics, detector and electronics) for a camera w ith a degree field of view and recognition range of one-hundred meters. In the head- mount application, the weight goal of three-hundred fifty (350) grams includes the sensor with display and power source. This program will transition through industry performers into DoD systems, allowing integration into small robotic platforms and micro-air vehicl es.

(U) The Stand-off Solid Penetrating Imaging program will detect a nd identify explosive threats at a stand-off distance, a critical requirement for force protection in all military operations, especially in ur ban scenarios. Multiple techniques will be available for dete ction, but no single technique provides both high probability of detection with low fa lse alarm rate, and identification of specific characteristics of the threat. A micro- system approach with multiple, synergistic sensor technologies integrated in a compact package will be critical to wide spread deployment of this sensor capability. (U) The microsystem approach involves the identification of signi ficant attributes from multiple non-over-lapping perspectives, suc h as shape and chemical signature, at stand-off ranges of fifty meters to potentially one hundred meters. This presents major challenges in imaging through opaque media, identifying signatures in parts per billion in hi gh background ambient, selecting specific wavelength bands of in terest, and the signal/imaging processing required for positive identification. Th e system configuration presents additional integration chall enges for potential application in manportable systems or sma ll autonomous vehicles. This program will transition through industry performers into DoD systems aimed at developing stand-off X-ray imaging devices for robotic vehicles. This program will allow X-ray imaging at a distance of up to 50 meters.

The basic idea behind the program is that a detector a rray can be fabricated on a hemispherical substrate using mater ials such as organic/inorganic semiconductors and that this array can be combined with a single lens to produce a wide field of view, small form factor camera. Organic materials have been shown to ha ve good electronic and optoelectronic proper ties including light emission and detection. Furthermore, in- plane organic/inorganic transistors can be incorporated for pr e-processing of images.

With widespread use of low light level technology, a new paradigm in low light level imaging is necessary t o maintain these distinct advantages and provide new capability beyond current im aging technology. The new appr oach will incorporate noiseless detection and processing of individual photon events to leve rage the benefits of solid state imaging and take advantage of three dimensional signal processing architecture at the detector. By detec ting an image formed from individual photon events without the addition of excess noise, the image can be processed and manipulated to provide the user image information not possible with current sensors. This technology will transi tion through industrial performers into eventual systems for sniper scope devices and electronic imaging sensors for micro-air vehicles.

Since contiguous coverage over large areas is essential, approaches w ill be developed to construct ex tremely large array assemblies f rom smaller arrays without loss of lines at the intersection between arrays. A ne w array architecture will be designed to integrate electronic ov erhead functions, such as synchronization clocks, power bias lines and ground connections in a three dimensional structure directly under the active p ixel array.

Growth approaches to be investigated include infrared quantum dots, which can be deposited directly from a solution, molecular beam epitaxy, and epitaxial growth on to selected areas of the silicon read-out. The growth techniques must be optimized to produce films with high optical absorption, and uniform fi lm characteristics consistent with deposition over large areas. Electrical contact to small size detector elements also will be addressed. Appro aches must be developed to form the electrical contact between small area detectors and input to low noise preamplifiers on the silicon subst rates. This program is directed at reducing pixel size to the dimension of the wave length, in the shortwave infrared (SWIR), mid-wave infrared (MWI R) and long- wave infrared (LWIR).

The eq uilibrium level of electronic charge carriers in a semiconductor material can be controlled by the applied bias, altering optical emission at the surface. In a light emitting diode, electronic injection of excess charge into a se miconductor stimulates radiation emission. Analogously, the ext raction of charge carriers suppresses radiation emitted from the sample. In the infrared spectral region, radiation emitted from a semiconductor defines the apparent temperature of the material. Control of the apparent temperatur e of infrared material has direct application in radiation shie lding for room temperature detectors, covert communications and marking targets in the infrared. Radiation shielding in a room temperature im ager has the potential to increase sensitivity five to ten times expanding the application base of room temperature infrared imagers. This program will develop materials where the apparent temp erature can be modulated above and below the bac kground level, with an average level of zero. Imagers without the specific code used will not have capability to detect the modul ation. Imagers cued to the code will detect the modulated s ignal.

Moore's law has driven the silicon industry for several decades with the minimum feature si ze on an integrated circuit (IC) reduced to 45 nm for today's commercial products. Due to challenging patterning requirements and comp lex circuit designs, costs of lithography to ols and masks have become unaffordable for low-volume manufacture, i.e., military electronics or application specific inte grated circuit (ASICs). Similarly, the circuit design, ver ification, and testing costs have also grown exponentially further preventing military electr onics from using advanced silicon technology nodes. Military e lectronics capabilities are currently limited by the high cost of nanofabricati on. To solve this important problem, DARPA has invested in a variety of maskless patterning technologies including pa rallel e-beam arrays, and an innovative e-beam lit hography tool. This program will develop revolutionary circuit design methodologies co upled with innovative hybrid maskless patterning tools to rea lize nanofabrication for low-volume defense or commercial ASICs. Su ch an approach can also address the nanofabrication requirements of other low- volume DoD technologies such as photonics and MEMs. (U) Program Plans: FY 2009 Plans: Evaluate the efficacy of regular geometry templates for impr oving lithographic performance for more robust imaging, simplified design/layout process, and increased throughput for maskless lithography methods.

Since the mixer is a critical part of the receiver and is located between t he LNA and ADC, this challenging dynamic-range goal will require th e output third intercept point of the mixer to be larger than +60 decibel milliwa tt (dBm). This regime of linearity performance is well beyond current state-o f-the-art. Although the linearity of the mixer usually increases with the power of the associated local oscillator, the projected power required to meet the +60dBm requirement will be impractical for most applicati ons.

There has been a long-standing desire to replace traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), which are pervasive in nearly all electronic warfare (EW), information warfare (IW), radar, and communication systems, with lower cost solid-state components. The DMT program will merge Polyst rata and GaN technologies to eliminate the need for monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs).

Warfight ers must be prepared for operations ranging from conflic t and peacekeeping in urban centers to heavy ba ttle actions in remote areas. Current capabi lities do not provide the commander with real-time, secure, si tuational awareness or the ability to orchest rate high-tempo planning, rehearsal, and e xecution. The programs in this project are developing and testing innovative, secure architectures and tools to enhance information processin g, dissemination, and presentation capabilities. The programs provide the commander in sight into the disposition of enemy and friendly forces, a joint situational awareness picture that will improve planning, decision-making, and execution support capability, as well as secure multimedia i nformation interfaces and software assurance to the warfighter \"on the move\". Integration of collection ma nagement, planning, and battlef ield awareness are essential elements for achieving battlefield domin ance through assured information systems. (U) Program Accomplishments/Planned Programs: Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 Joint Air/Ground Operations: Unified, Adaptive Replanning (JAGUAR) program improves battle management for complex air campaigns that employ new air platforms featuring precision senso rs, weapons and communications relays. The JAGUAR system is d riven by: 1) targeting information, both for sensor targets and strikes, e xpressed as point and area targets (i.e., search, combat air patro l); 2) rules of engagement and procedural constraints, such as airspace restric tions; and 3) availability of platforms, weapons, sensors, and c ommunications equipment. From this information, JAGUAR produces ingress rout es, flight schedules and patrol zones, while assuring airspace a nd electronic deconfliction. The technology provides pilo ts and commanders the option to choose conve ntional tactics or conceive unconventio nal operations. In the latter case, the system captures the innovation and retains the strategic maneuver for future mission plans.

HURT employs a model-based control archit ecture with dynamic teaming and platform-independent comma nd and control. The system registers ne w platforms with the battle manager (kine matics, maneuverability, endurance, payloa ds, and communications links) to facilitate plat form-independent tasking. HURT provides a co mmander's interface that allows collaborative tasking of the platforms in the form of operational missions, such as search, track, identi fy, or engage, rather than routes and events. Additionally, it supplies computationall y intensive decision aids, such as advanced 4-D airspace and g roundspace deconfliction tools, route planners, and t ask/platform assignments algorithms. The technology presents mission status and futu re courses of action to commanders for collaborative adjudication. HURT enables augmentation of low-footpr int, rapidly deployable, easily sustainab le human command structures with teams of machines operating together.

(U) The goal of the Collision Avoidance and Dynamic Airspace Control program is to maximize airspace utilization through dynamic mi litary airspace management. Today's labor-intensive human centric airs pace management processes result in an inefficient use of airsp ace and limit the density and responsiveness of airborne systems. Further, the introduction of unmanned aircraft has increasingly complicated th e challenge, leading to operating constraints and the potential for mishaps re lated to the different characteristics of manned and unmanned systems. This program will evaluate and develop technologies for an automated and distributed system that e fficiently manages all objects in the airspace to include munitions, manned and unmanned aircra ft. Specifically focused on the needs of the military, the program will enable pr ovable levels of safety while ensuring military freedom of maneuver. The automate d system will be developed as a replacement for current manage ment systems and processes and will support all service users. Challenges to be addressed include complex algorithms and network informatio n exchange, and integration with legacy, degraded and intentionally disruptive ai rcraft. The program will also explore novel concepts of opera tion enabled by radically enhanced airspace utilization. The capabilities deve loped by this program will benefit all of the Services.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Advanced Ground Tactical Battle Manager 4.133 6.000 8.389 (U) The Advanced Ground Tactical Battle Manage r program develops automated decision supp ort tools for Army and Marine tactical commanders at the division level and below. The program also provides support for combined operations employing dismounted sol diers, manned platforms, and autonomous vehicles. The tool elicits skeletal courses of action through a grap hical interface with unit comman ders and extends plans by applying adversarial reasoning techniques to identif y vulnerabilities and opportunities in the predicted enemy course of action. Finally, it examines modifications or counteractions to reduce vu lnerabilities. Products will transition to the Army. (U) The Real-time Adversarial Reasoning and D ecision-making (RAID) program develops technologies to anticipate enemy actions, especially in urban operations against irregular combatants. E xperiments demonstrate how RAID can assist a Distributed Common Ground System-Army operator in the preparation of better intelligence products as compared to those built by un-assisted analysts. (U) The Know What Is to Know Subsystem (KWIKS) develops a suppor t tool that autonomously and continually, during the execution of a military operation, tracks the state of what is known about the environment (and how well), and what are the forms and prioriti es of additional collection needs. This tool will provide substantially automate d assistance to the current (laborious and non-real-time) proce ss of collections planning, which currently includes manual st eps such as analysis of external contex t, enemy and neutral goals and capabilities, and assessment of known threats. The overall benefit is more effective, rapid, co mplete identification of enemy state, resulting in achieving mi ssion objectives with fewer friendly casualties and lower collateral damage.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Urban Commander 4.006 8.000 6.000 (U) The Urban Commander thrust develops automated tools to help gr ound commanders construct detailed, realistic operational plans, particularly in nontraditional a nd urban environments. Partial plans are represen ted in hierarchical task networks and visuali zed through synchronization matrices, icon overlays, or tactical sketch anim ations. Commanders and staff modify, refine, and extend a plan through voice, sketching, and semi-structured input. The system links fragmen ts constructed at different sit es, transfers information among r elated parts, and discovers and recommends solutions for inc onsistencies. The system continuously compiles a set of plan cases and employs analo gical matching to propose extensions to current plans suggested by past experi ence. Plan elements are communi cated through an integrated set of protocols from the unit commander down to dismount commanders equipped with advanced heads-up displays and helmet-worn sensors. Finally, the program continuously assesses progress against the operational pl an and alerts users to significant deviations. (U) The Multi-spectral Adaptive Networked Tactical Imaging System (M ANTIS) program develops, integrates, and demonstrates a soldier - worn visualization system. Both helmet-mount ed and handheld versions are being built. The system consists of five elements: 1) multi-spectral sensor suite; 2) high resolution digital display; 3) inertial measurement unit; 4) high-speed pr ocessor; and 5) power supply. MANTIS provides the warfighter with digitally-fused imagery in real time from th e multi-spectral sensor suite, exploiting three distinct spectral b ands. The fused imagery is shown on two displays; one has a wide field-of view an d the other a narrow field-of-view. When viewed together, the system furnishes a larger field-of-view image with simultaneous high resolution and stereo capability. The system also allows the warfighters t o record and \"play back\" the video while on the battlefield. MANTIS interfaces with the future soldier's advanced communications and networking s ystems, allowing the warfighter to send/receive video images and position in formation with fellow soldiers and commanders in real time. There is a Memorandum of Agreement in place with the Program Executive Offi cer Soldier, and Night Vision & Electronics Sensor Directorate for transition at the conclusion of Phase III anticipated to be completed early in FY 2008. 388UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item 50 Page 9 of 36 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Command, Control and Communications Systems PE 0603760E, Project CCC-01 (U) The ULTRA-VIS program develops an integrated system to provide Army and Marine small unit leaders with the ability to conduct daytime operations in an urban environment. The system include s a conformal, see-through, optical waveguide visor that display s intra-squad commands, alerts, and even icons that are attached to the urba n landscape. Network protocols support information management to allow the squad leader to hand-off actionable information and direct alerts to the squad/fire teams for real-time collaboration without overloa d. ULTRA-VIS relays standard phrases and visual annotations that can be issued covertly, avoiding hand signals or shouting that may be recog nized by the enemy. A robust, optically-assisted navigation technique will provide co ntinuous geo-location and head tracking for each squad member while operating in GPS-denied environments. The system synthesizes weapon fire observables across a networked moving squad to detect and locat e hostile weapon fire using a helmet mounted IR sens or and small acoustic array for precise snip er location and real time designation wit hin the warfighter's visor. ULTRA-VIS empowers the small unit leader w ith a clear tactical advantage through inter/intra-squad collabo ration, heightened awareness and the ability to take decisive action while on-the-move . The ULTRA-VIS technology is planned for transition to the Army. (U) Program Plans: Multi-spectral Adaptive Networked Tactical Imaging System (MANTIS).

These tools increase the tempo of the tactical commande r's observe-orient-decide-act loop, the quality of decisions, th e contribution of data point input across the organization, and the necessary communicat ions capabilities needed to support this decision structure. This effort develops a set of tools to evaluate risks and identifies optimal \"netwo rk configuration pivot points,\" and automates specific configurat ions for each network element. The Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C 4) tool suite provides the warfighter with a reliable communica tions network, which is critical to successful military operations. The t ools apply to crisis management situations for tactical com manders and could be transitioned to existing emergency response command and control sy stems as well as emerging tactical command and control system s. The technologies developed under this program transition to the Army.

This new te chnology promises to enable information systems to adapt - during deployme nt, in real time - to the changing conditions that military co mmanders confront. Information systems automatically adjust to new environments and new users, helping commanders adapt to evolving sit uations and priorities, and accelerating the incorporation of new personnel in to command operations. This program funds portions of the te chnologies developed in the Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) progr am (funded in PE 0602304E, Project COG-02) that are ready for ap plication to command and control systems. (U) From an operational perspective, cognitive approaches to information processing offer three major enhancements to current comma nd and control systems. First, they efficiently sort, segregate, separ ate and identify relevant data based on priority hierarchies es tablished by the command structure. For example, image data can be selected base d on target priority, historical context or anomalous changes. Second, cognitive technologies adapt the presentation of information to suit the need s and preferences of the individual commander. Finally, cog nitive systems make relevant data generally available to all users both during collaborative planning processes and individual tactical analysis. In short, cognitive technology is introducing the equivalent of \"just in time\" inventory management to information management for command decision- making. (U) The Army's Command Post of the Future (CPOF), STRATCOM's St rategic Knowledge Integration We b (SKIweb), the Navy Marine Corp Intranet (NMCI), and the Web Timeline Analysis System (Web TAS) are candidate systems for insertion of this new technology. This will ultimately reduce the staffing footprint of command centers. (U) Program Plans: FY 2008 Plans: Develop initial prototypes of cognitively-e nhanced versions of the following systems suitable (e.g., certifiable) for use on mi litary networks: Command Post of the Future (CPOF); Strategic Know ledge Integration Web (SKIweb); Navy Marine Corp Intranet (NMCI); and Web Timeline Analysis System (WebTAS). FY 2009 Plans: Develop and refine advanced ope rational of cognitively-enhanced vers ions of the CPOF, SKIweb, NMCI, that would provide users with adva nced information management capabilities such as learning to anticipate users' inform ation needs, pre-fetching needed information, l earning users' interests, alerting users about the occurrence of events of interest, c oordinating teams, and managing message traffic. 391UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item 50 Page 12 of 36 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Command, Control and Communications Systems PE 0603760E, Project CCC-01 Demonstrate, test, and evaluate PAL-enhanced information syst ems in military exercises to validate that the PAL technologies ar e robust to the dynamics and uncertainties of the battlefield a nd dramatically compensate for end-user \"cognitive overload\". Narrative Title Awareness 2.258 3.000 1.000 (U) The Predictive Battlespace Awareness program develops tools to in teractively draw upon a distributed network of human experts, allowing them to collaboratively anticipate an opponent's future actions. The progr am enables commanders to pre-position senso rs, weapons, and information to counter the opponent's actions. The program de velops model and knowledge-based t echniques to predict areas of o peration and tactical objectives. The technology supports the modeling of courses of action ranging over ti me horizons from hours to days. Program techniques permit \"on-the-fly\" tailoring of models and contextu al knowledge, and leverage knowle dge of sensor effectiveness, mo bility factors, tactical templates, and target characteristics. Techniques in clude variable-fidelity prediction, such as the ability to determ ine both target locations over minutes and force zones of influence over hours. The tools an ticipate enemy operations in time to thwart them with effect s-based targeting, enabling use of sensors and other resources in proactive modes. The program both enables commanders to avoid canned responses and supports rapid incorporation of insights about new enemy strategies, capab ilities, and tactics from peacetime to the heat of battle. Th e program significantly enhances today's mostly manual, slow planning, and analysis processes. Technologies are planned to be transition ed to the Air Force Distributed Common Ground Station.

(U) Program Accomplishments/Planned Programs: Narrative Title FY 2007 FY Modulation (PZRM) Communications 4.127 1.398 1.000 The goal of the Polarized Rotation Modulation (PZRM) Communicati ons program is to develop new extremely high data rate, point-t o- point, or point-to-multipoint wireless communications waveform using the PZRM/Orthogonal Signal Spectrum Overlay (OSSO) communi cations concept to exploit the presently unused polar ization and rotation dimensi ons of radiation. The PZRM communications program wil l investigate the use of polarization, including OSSO, modulation and the abilit y for conventional radios to ca rry all information over the t ransmitted signal amplitude, phase and frequency. Polarization modulation introduces an additional dimensi on. A radio with four polarization po ssibilities would transmit four times the information with all other aspects of the wa veform held constant. OSSO enables multiple orthogonal sig nals to overlay one another in the same radio bandwidth thereby increasing spectral e fficiency. Use of the antenna as part of the information proc essing architecture of a radio has not been previously performed. This technolog y will greatly increase the capacity of existing radio channels wi thout increasing spectrum or modem complexity. The program will be demonstrated as an enhancement to an otherwise state-of-the-art communicatio ns system. The PZRM technology will transition to Service applications in FY 2009.

Currently SOF teams rely on satellite communications (Satcom) for long-range connectivity. However, Sa tcom requires line of site access, and channel availability. The Advanced HF Communications will develop antenna and radi o technology to provide high-rate communicat ions at long ranges using ground wave a nd near vertical incidence skywave (NVIS) propagation.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Next (XG) 3.994 1.600 1.000 (U) The Next Generation (XG) program goals are to develop both the enabling technologies and system concepts to provide dramatic improvements in assured military communications in support of a full range of worldwide deployments through dynamic spectrum ac cess. U.S. Forces face unique spectrum access issues in each country in which they operate due to competing civilian or government users o f national spectrum. These constraints must be reflected in all force pl anning and may preclude operation of critical systems. Coalition and allied operations are even more complex to manage, and may severely limit the U.S. ability to fully exploit its superiority and investment in inf ormation technology. The XG program approach is to develop the theore tical underpinnings for dynamic access to the spectrum, the techno logies and subsystems that enable dynamic access, and the system prototyp es to demonstrate applicability to legacy and future DoD radio fr equency emitters. The program is investigating methods to le verage the technology base in microelectronics with new waveform and medium access an d control protocol technologies to construct an integrated system. The pr ogram goals are to develop, inte grate, and evaluate the technol ogy to enable equipment to automatically select spectrum and operating modes to both minimize disruption of existing users, and to ensure ope ration of U.S. systems. The result of the XG program will be to develop and demonstrate a set of standard dynamic spectrum adaptation technol ogies for legacy and future emitter systems for joint service utility. The XG communi cations technology is planned to transition to the Army fo r implementation in a range of current and future communication systems in cluding the Joint Tactical Radio Systems clusters.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) 5.383 3.992 3.995 (U) The Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) program will achieve an or der of magnitude reduction of voice communication bit rates in noi sy military environments over current state-o f-the-art voice encoders (VOCODER). Such a reduction will significantly decrease the probability of detection of transmitted signals and will also decrease the requi red transmit energy, thereby increasing battery lifetime. The program will pursue two novel approaches toward achieving its goal. One approach builds upon multiple noise-im mune sensors that have been combined with traditional coding algorithms to achieve significant improvements in intelligibility and quality in harsh noisy environments at 2,400 bits per second (bps). This approach will be extended to nontraditional ultra-low-bit-rate coding algorithms in order to achieve 300 bps codin g capability in harsh military environments. Alternative approaches will also be e xplored, such as the communication without acoustic information ac hieved by extracting laryngeal and sublingual muscle signals that are produced when a person generates sub vo cal speech. This approach w ill yield a revolutionary capability in situations where stealth is of the ut most importance, or in situations where acoustic signals canno t be used, such as under water. The ASE technology is planned for transition to th e Special Operations Command and the Communications and Electro nics Command of the U.S. Army after a prototype demonstration scheduled for FY 2009.

(U) The DoD is transforming to a more network centric focus for military operations. Netw ork centricity, among other benefits, fac ilitates the sharing of situation information and access to resources. Shar ed situation awareness enables collaboration and self-synchroniz ation at all operational levels thereby greatly increasi ng mission effectiveness. Military campaigns in the future will not necessarily be focused solely on major military operations. These campaigns will involve attempts at conflict avoidance, and if this fails, possibly major comb at operations with periods of various security, stability, reconstruction, transforma tion and transition operations. Future campaigns will be cha racterized by an increased demand for the commander to employ the most appropria te actions (diplomatic, information operations, military, econom ic, etc.) against the adversary's various political, military (air, land and sea; re gular or irregular), economic, social, information distributi on, infrastructure, etc. systems. Commanders in the future will use network centricity to access a larger base of knowledge sources and a greater range of resources and actions. Concurrently, the commander will be challenged to ex ploit these capabilities to achieve a mixture of appropriate effe cts. (U) The Conflict Modeling, Planning, and Outcomes Experimentation (C OMPOEX) research effort is developing technologies that will enhance the capability of leaders to plan and conduct government campaigns. This includes a comprehensive suite of decision su pport tools that help leaders with: visualizing and understanding the situation and the complex operational environment they must operate in; co nstructing and managing plans that enable the commander to synchronize and inte grate interdependent effects over a long period of time; employ ing the best sequence of unified actions to produce the desired effects; a nd generating and exploring options and courses of action to under stand the range of outcomes and appreciate the side effects that may occur.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Fiber-Optical Network for Aerospace Platforms 3.525 2.500 5.845 (U) The Fiber-Optical Network for Aerospace Platforms program will facilitate building or upgrading military aircraft and other aer ospace platforms with a fiber-optical networking infrastructure. Th is will have many capabilities that are well beyond those of curre ntly used copper- based technology. Originally, the program focused on specific technologies for application on the Navy's EA-6B Prowler aircraf t, however, the program has been broadened to focus on technologies that will provide advanced cap abilities to a multitude of military aircraft , shipboard and aerospace platforms. These new capabilities include: scalability in bandwidth and number of connected devices; immunity to ele ctromagnetic interference (EMI) and cable cross-talk; re duced cable and overall system weight and volume; increased reliability without an a ssociated weight or volume penalty; ease of integration and futu re upgradeability; and the ability to carry mixed analog and digital signal formats . This will be accomplished by taking full advantage of fiber-optical wavele ngth-division-multiplexing (WDM) t echnology and leveraging optoele ctronic photonic integration techniques developed in DARPA photonics com ponents program. To reduce size, weight and power requirements and to increase the reliability and the flexibility of interconnecting arb itrarily placed client devices with various signal formats, use will be made of passive, transparent, wavelength-routing technology at the core of the network, and tunable optical transmitters and receivers (transceivers) to inter-connect the client devices at the edge of the network. The technologies developed under th is program are planned for tra nsition to the Services in FY 2010. 404UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 50 Page 25 of 36 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Command, Control and Communications Systems PE 0603760E, Project CCC-02 (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Developed unclassified networking requiremen ts for various tactical and wide body military aircraft for enabling open discussio ns in the international standards bodies.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Next Generation Routing and Addressing 3.557 3.750 4.550 (U) The Next Generation Routing and Addressing program seeks to deve lop networks that use topographically distributed addresses (e. g., geographically or by organizational unit). Current network routing methodologies use internet protocol (IP) address numbers th at are distributed in no defined pattern or methodology. As a result, current r outing systems spend large amounts of time and computing power upd ating and maintaining tables that \"point\" to where different IP addresses ar e located geographically. The development of new network add ressing schemes will reduce the load on routers as well as greatly simplify router configuration. These networks will be a paradigm shift such that numbered IP addresses will no longer exist, and changes to the Domain Naming Server (DNS) system will allow for services to mobile users.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY The Connectionless Networking (CN) program developed technology to allow networks (such as una ttended ground sensors (UGS)) to send and receive messages without initial link acquisition or previo us sharing of routing information. This improved energy us age per bit of delivered information by as much as 100 to 1,000 times compared to conventional and near-term deployable communications systems and allowed data to be collected more efficiently from high value, but en ergy limited sensors. Conventional radio link and network designs expend most of the energy on link establishment and maintenance, as well as packet and network overhead. This energy requirement not only limits the lifetime of energy-limited systems, it unnecessarily fills the radio spectru m, limiting available bandwidth, creates unnecessary risks of d etection, and increases thermal loads. These impacts are particularly severe fo r communications with proliferated sensors, or remotely opera ted weapons. Eliminating the requirement to maintain a continuous network link enabled these platforms to provide continuous connectivity wi thout consumption of power, or compromising emanations. The CN pr ogram exploited existing and ava ilable signal processing components , intelligent (processing and memory intensive) routing, and availability of situational informati on to demonstrate a total energy savings of at least 100 times typical connection oriented network applica tions. The CN technology is planning transition to the Special Operations Command, Army, Navy, and Marines for unattended ground sensors and low duty cycle applications.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 SATCOM CX program developed a proof of concept system that enabled multiple users' access to 100 kilobits per second (kbps) SATCOM channels using the existing C-band satellite architecture. This new capability became possible, in part, by moving away from the existing paradigm regarding usage of these satellites. This SATCOM CX paradigm envisions satellit es as merely a node or relay for a single user. In communications terminology, the satellite is part of a single- input/single-output (SISO) channe l. Instead, this program con sidered multiple satellites simultaneously. Using this approach, a multitude of co-channel users send signals that illuminate a multitude of sa tellites. Powerful processing algorithms then isolate the individual communication li nks. Using the constellation in this manner provides signal gain and interference rejection. (U) The increased complexity of the SATCOM CX communication link dema nds dynamic and adaptive network protocols to ensure optimal performance is achieved. The technologies de veloped under this program will transition to the Services' expeditionary forces. (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: Demonstrated concept feasibility by using the space segment (C-band transponder) and tr ansmission channel to provide sufficient stability to support the phase locked loop (PLL) operation required by the SATCOM CX forward link algorithms to maintain expect ed gains.

The program allows commanders and their staffs to share situ ation information, develop coor dinated battle plans, generate and compare alternate courses of action, a nd assess likely outcomes, without conventional group briefings. Net work Command builds on the paradigm established by the Command Post of the Fu ture program, which demonstrated to commanders, working with vo ice-over- internet protocol (VOIP) and robust graphical collaboration so ftware, a coherent understanding of a situation and operational p lan without any face-to-face interactions. The Network-Centric Situation Assessment pr ogram develops and deploys technologies to assess military situations at levels of i nterest above individual targets. The program uses all-source data to reconstruct unit organizations , mission relationships, logistics connections, and communications connectivity and analyzes data over time to infer movement, communicat ion, and supply patterns. Within this context, capability analyses are provided and future courses of action are hypothesized. The objective is to understand potent ial capabilities and intentions of opposing forces. This effort provides greater understanding of opponents' force structures, cap abilities, and operational practices, and then enables comma nders to sustain effects-based targeting rather than simple attrition strategies. The program provides a context for discovering vulnerabilities in opposing fo rces and provides cues for intellig ence, surveillance, and rec onnaissance planning, as it suggests areas of future enemy activity that mer it intense scrutiny. Technologies are planned to transition to the U.S. Army Distributed Common Ground Station. The Joint Mission Rehearsal program integrates high-fidelity; ma inframe-based combat simulations with situation assessment and planning tools. The objective is to allow rehearsal of joint mi ssions, while participants are en route to operations or remain at their home stations. The program uses current situa tion data to: (1) provide initial conditions for the simulations, and (2) plan data to steer the dynamics of the simulations along the selected courses of action. The technology streams data from the simulations for display , then visualization systems are available to the prospective participan ts. The visualization permits the warfighter to interact with the simulation in a manner consistent with their anticip ated role in the mission being rehearsed.

The program will provide a set of prototype demonstrations of the capabilities in surrogate urban combat enviro nments. Technologies are planned to transition to the U.S. Special Operations Command and the Marines. The Smart Dust Sensor Networks Applied to Urban Area Operations program will provide persistent staring reconnaissance, surveil lance, and target acquisition of the 3-D urban battlespace using a dense ne twork of ground sensors. The system concept consists of ub iquitous and inconspicuous low-power, small and eas ily concealed ground sensors distributed throughout the urban landscape. The program includes the development of ultra small sensor nodes for easy depl oyment and concealment in a cr owded urban environment and dat a fusion algorithms to exploit the abundance of new information provided by a dense urba n spatial network.

(U) The Urban Ops Hopper program will develop a semi-autonomous hybrid hopping/articulated wh eeled robotic platform that could adap t to the urban environment in real-time and provide both surgical le thality and/or Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (I SR) to any point of the urban jungle while remaining lightweight , small and expendable to minimize the burde n on the soldier. In general, small ro bots or unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) are severely limited by obstacle negotiati on capability. The demonstrated hopping capability allows smal l UGVs to overcome obstacles 40x-60x their own size. Hopping will extend robot navigation to si x degrees-of-freedom situational location and mapping. Hopping mobility can be shown to be five times more efficient than hovering for obstacles at heights less than or equal to ten meters. The proposed hopping robot would be truly multi-functional in that it will negotiate all aspects of the urban battlefield to delive r ISR and/or lethal payloads to non-line-of-sight targets with precision. The artic ulated wheel design allows the robot to negotiate short-range o bstacles for precision placement in difficult terrain.

Narrative Title FY 2007 Total RF a nd Ranging (TORDAR) system as part of PUCS. (U) The Multipath Exploitation Radar (MER) program will address rada r deficiencies due to discontinuous bandwidth: reduced range coverage, denial in certain geographic regi ons, interoperability issues, and reduced ra nge resolution. This will involve a sys tem-wide redesign of radar optimized over the full RF spectrum, not individual stove-pip ed tasks. It will include the integration of sparse bandwid th returns (including passive signals of opportunity), adaptive transmitter and wavefo rm diversity, and agile frequency diverse hardware. Another ke y area that can be exploited is urban multipath. This program will exploit multip ath bounces to detect and track moving targets within urban cany ons, and extend the area coverage rate of airborne sensors by a factor of ten or more over physical line-of-sight limits. If successful, the urban coverage improvement will make it cost effective to consider airborne surveillance of an area the size of a large metropolitan area with a handful o f airborne sensors. This capability will facilitate both manned and unmanned airborne Inte lligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and is planned to transition to the Air Force and Army in 2011. 438UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 53 Page 11 of 26 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Network-Centric Warfare Technology PE 0603766E, Project NET-01 (U) Program Plans: FY 2008 Plans: Develop improved tracking concepts to exploit multipath si gnatures in improving target localization and tracking.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 River Eye* 4.557 *Previously funded under Mobile Undersea Distributed Systems (MUDS). (U) Early entry maritime forces need maps of morphology, water dept hs, and currents in complex riveri ne/estuarine environments for mission planning and execution. This information is critical for rout e planning, sensor placement, rendezvous determination, vulnerabi lity assessments, and determining objective assault engagement/disengagement strate gies. For uncharted and/or denied areas, present methods are inadequate for obtaining the necessary information. Relia ble remote sensing methods do not exist that produce bathymetry and water current da ta in waters that are sediment laden (bottom is not visible) and/or sheltered (s well and significant wind waves are not likely). The River Eye e ffort will provide a new capability to predict or assess, in real time, river and estua ry conditions to enable special operations mission planning a nd execution. New techniques will be developed to indirectly determine current sp eed and direction by remotely sensing advection of scene feature s. Using advanced modeling techniques, indirectly sensed current data will be used to extract bathymetry data. Forward circulation models will u se the bathymetry data to predict future currents and water heights in a mission planning decision support tool. The River Eye effort is anticip ated to transition to the Navy and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in FY 2010. 449 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 53 Page 22 of 26 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Network-Centric Warfare Technology PE 0603766E, Project NET-02 (U) Program Plans: FY 2007 Accomplishments: airborne and satellite data collecti ons in well-mixed, instrumented estuary.

Target characteristi cs potentially obtainable may include targe t image, shape, size, structural features, and other advanced threat properties. By extending the operating range of current active electro-optic se nsors, SEER enables the friendly platform to stand off from the maximum operating ra nge of hostile sensors/weapons, while executing the targeting t ask and directing weapons against targets.

Narrative FY program to extract high-rate (kHz+) temporal data from a foveated vision infrared (IR) sensor. This provides the capability to optimize data processing at the pi xel level, including data fusion in real time at the pixel level. The concept goes well beyond foveated vision and bandwidth sensor compression concepts by en abling a low light sensor to not only act as an intelligent cuei ng device but also to shift to a high frame rate mode. This will provide visible IR with applications into complimentary metal-oxide-semiconducto r visible sensors as well as temporal (frequency) data on objects of interest within the field of view of the IR sensor. This will enable the detec tion of acoustic and high modulation rate signatures from low-light IR sensor and pr ovide on-sensor data fusion capabilities for rapid detection and identification.

(U) The Persistent Operational Surface Surveillan ce and Engagement (POSSE) program creates a system of systems framework in which a mix of surveillance assets, both operational a nd developmental, can be c oordinated and exploited to yield persistent surveillan ce of insurgent activities. The program focus is on the Iraqi theatre, using a sp iral approach designed to insert enhanced counter-insurgency capabilities into operational use as soon as possible, followed by improvements and e nhancements as they become integrated through a domestic tes tbed. The efficacy and timeliness of surveillance affo rded by the program's systems-level appr oach will significantly exceed that afforde d by individual Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) components, and will result in substantially enhanced force protection for fix ed sites, convoys, and military operations. The framework includes data exploitatio n at both forward-deployed and national sites to support both quick-reaction cueing to engage insurgents, and deeper fo rensic analysis to identify their support structures. POSSE attacks the insurgent ne twork to find activities indicative of bomb making perpetrators. The POSSE program is jointly funded with the Joint Improvised Explosive Dev ice Defeat Task Force.

Dynamic net resource management technology will scale to support hundreds of vehicles i n flight. Advanced information security techniques provide secure weapon data links and cont roller handovers. QNT technology transitions via insertion into DoD's existing and emerging weapons, tactical UAV's, and tactical handheld units after the program is completed in FY 2009. The Wide Area Video Exploitation program w ill develop technology to enable wide fiel d-of-view Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) imagery framing cameras in airborne platforms to detect and tr ack, in real time, multiple moving objects under a wide range of conditions and topography. Current systems are able to collect data and pr ovide an ability to backtrack individual targets post-facto. T he Sonoma- Plus program aims to provide a real-time ability to track in forward time multiple potential targets from high-altitude video i magery. On- board processing will be crucial since imagery data volumes will amount to gigabytes per second. Multi-hypothesis tracking of dozens and eventually hundreds of entities will also be developed, and imagery stabilization b ased on prior digital elevation models w ill also facilitate tracking and track analysis. Technol ogies are planned for transition to the Army. The Expeditionary Distributed Common Group System (DCGS) Gl obal Information Grid (GIG) for Exploitation Services (EDGES) program provides layered and persistent Intelligence, Surveilla nce and Reconnaissance (ISR) of asymmetric and irregular warfigh ters in support of Marine Corps and Special Operations. The unique feat ure of EDGES will be the ability to intelligently interpret sol dier requests for situation assessment data, access local tactical threat data bases, and fuse multi-sensor data for accurate, timel y target detection, tracking, and identification. This system approach couples the deployment of a dedicated UAV system responsive to t hese small units, with data preprocessing and feature extraction to en able the efficient and timely transmission of actionable comba t information to the troops. With the ability to support two-wa y communications with wideband reach back, information and observ ations received from the small operation unit will be integrated into th e EDGES information data base and communicated to the higher commands. Through the ISR processing algorithms, sensor fusion ope rations and communication connectivity to the area of regard as well as the higher level of commands, EDGES will function as an ISR tool to the small unit and provide actionable persistent an d dedicated service.

The program also feat ures techniques enabling video sensors to autonomously and simult aneously track multiple vehicular targets through dense traffic, temporary occlusion or exit from sensor field of view, in military surv eillance and strike operations, and supports target det ection of moving vehicles and/or dismounts in very low resolutions. VIVID significan tly advances the capabilities of video surveillan ce and moving target strike for numerous military missions, including military ope rations in foreign urban areas. DARPA has established a MOA with the Air Fo rce to transition the VIVID technology to the Predator.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Target Identification Technology 17.344 16.979 13.000 (U) The Target Identification Technology thrust develops semiautoma tic methods to identify targets from sensors operating in all sp ectral bands. Its objective is to detect, characterize, and identif y military threats, and to assess the environment around them. Da ta sources include national, theater, and organic sensors. Critical performance metr ics are timeliness, accuracy, error rates, and interpretation workload. The thrust addresses the challenges of target identification, acquisition an d tracking under restrictive rules of engagement. The technol ogies will apply advanced signal processing and machine vision to leverage advan ces in sensor capabilities. Four programs are funded in this th rust: The Tactical Sensor Network Technologies (TSNT) program develope d detection, tracking, identification, and pattern analysis cap abilities that operate in all nodes (fixed or mobile) within a networked, distributed multi-sens or system. The processing is performed a t each network node depending on the sensors reporting to that node, th e subscribing commanders, and resource management decisions. T SNT leveraged the advantages of a self-forming adaptive network for signal processing and its algorithms adapt based on self-discov ered network topology, power management constraints, communications bandwidth limitations, and constraints found in the local enviro nment. TSNT has demonstrated resilience to the fa ilure of any node while maintaining suffi cient consistency to support commanders' collaborative tactical planning. Technologies transitioned to th e U.S. Army (PEO Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Directora te). The Exploitation of 3-D Data (E3D) program has developed tec hniques for rapidly exploiting 3-D sensor data. The initial progra m effort consisted of three distinct processes: Target Acquisition, Targ et Recognition, and Modeling. The resulting software tools were integrated into operational ground stations processing 3-D sensor data. The E3D technology was transitioned to SOCOM in FY 2006. The 3-D Reasoning (3DR) initiative is a follow-on program to E3D which will develop techniques to automatically generate large, fully a nnotated 3-D urban models from the rich sources of high-resolution laser radar data available from ground-b ased and airborne platforms. 3DR 478UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 54 Page 25 of 42 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 extends vehicle-centric automated target recognition methods to support the much broader class of objects accessible in urban a nd complex terrain - particularly side-looking sensors mounted on patr ol vehicles. The program consists of four distinct componen ts: (1) new methods to rapidly and precisely co-register 3-D and 2-D data from disparate ground and airborne sources; (2) new 3-D recogniti on approaches that identify objects within a class based on limited initial training; (3) a flexible and expandable 3-D database s tructure to support the highly detailed and evol ving urban models and provide the basis for ge ometry-based queries; and (4) a user interfac e that provides rapid and flexible access to the data. The resulting software tools and modeling capabilities will be integrated into future command posts and operational SOCOM and Army units in the field at the conclusion of the program, anticipated to be completed i n FY 2008. The All-Source Target Characterization program develops a colle ction and measurement capability to characterize new targets as they emerge on the battlefield. This effort develops tools to perm it rapid user interaction with imagery, sensor data, and processi ng results and provides real-time feedback to operators indicating key target features and other discriminates. The program will engage unive rsities and industry to develop technology for integrated near real time auto mation support for real time ai rborne target acquisition and t arget confirmation using a combination of advan ced radar exploitation and electro-optical/in frared imagery. This initiative will als o develop and demonstrate robust target cueing and id entification over large classes of targets w ithin a computational form factor approp riate for insertion into strike aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. Th e technology provides tools to process and disseminate target s ignatures to the field in usable formats for direct insertion into operationa l systems. It enhances operator interfaces with extant analysi s workstations to allow on-the-fly collection of signature data with little/no intervention for the operator. Technologies are planned for tr ansition to the Air Force Distributed Common Ground Station in FY 2009 and subsequently to the U.S. Army Future Combat System. Most developmental work will be performed by un iversities and industrial contractors, with system architecture, performance trades, and evaluation performed by Government pa rticipants and transition partners.

Narrative Title FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Advanced Radar Sensor Technology 12.000 14.000 18.000 (U) The Advanced Radar Sensor Technology thrust develops radar systems to provide significant improvements in our ability to detect , identify, and track surface targets and threats over very wide areas in all climatic conditions. Program efforts focus on expl oiting emergent and novel radar sensing technology and phenomenology. Key elements are advancements in ultra-wide band, bistatics, UHF/VHF, polari metric change detection, tomographic imaging, space-time adaptive pr ocessing and other advanced signal processing, advanced Ground Mov ing Target Indication techniques, and foliage, building- penetrating, and ground-penetrating radar phenomenology. Progra m developments are integrated with current and emerging military platforms. Emphasis is on the mo st stressing military radar sensor challenges. Examples are ope rations featuring complex cluttered ground environments; tho se against small and slow moving surface targ ets; urban operations, and situations wh ere camouflage, decoys and countermeasures must be overcom e. Programs in this thrust include: The Augmented Aerial Sentry (AAS) program designed a rapidly-deployable airborne syst em to provide assured protection of perman ent or temporary U.S. base camps in hostile territory. AAS could accommodate ground-based, wide area sensors in conjunction with a ir platforms to maintain continuous surveillance of the area around the camp, detecting potential intr uders or weapon launches. T he suite of airborne sensor platforms could then be tasked locally to inv estigate potential threats; lock on to personnel or weapons involv ed in an attack; allow commanders to confirm threats; or authorize precision weapons to engage them. The Sensing and Exploitation of Urban Movers (SE-UM) program develops technology for th e detection of dismounted troops in comb at situations using airborne radars. SE-UM develops the capability to detect, classify, track and recognize the behavior of human beings using radar data. Existing rada rs have been shown to allow this capability un der ideal circumstances; those under development will, either fortuitously or by design, more consiste ntly obtain detections from individuals. SE-UM will exploit these data by detecting ea ch 481UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 54 Page 28 of 42 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 individual, classifying the individual as human and according to their speed and gait, tracking many individuals (forward and b ackwards in time) and automatically recognizing common, anomalous and significant actions/behaviors . Challenges include detection of motio n below the minimum discernable velocity of the radar system, and discernm ent of multiple moving objects within a single beam width. U sing SE- UM on data from appropriately designed airborne radar the system could observe human motion over an entire urban region. SE-UM technologies will transition to the airborne sy stems deployed by the Air Force and Navy. The NetTrack program will extend capabilities for persistent track ing and targeting of moving vehi cles from airborne radars. N etTrack will improve capabilities in two ways: the system will network radars together and use advanced radar techniques to gather \"sig natures\" of vehicles. The signatures, which are collections of radar featur es, will be stored and passed over the radar network. The syst em will compare vehicle signatures taken before and after confusing events to maintain the tr ack of the target vehicles. Extended long -term airborne radar tracking will be an important long-range, all-weather, capability. It will extend the kill chain to enable vehi cle engagement hours after target designation, enable behavioral analysis of ve hicle movements to gauge enemy operational structure, force com position, and intentions, and provide a higher level of situational awareness at every level. Technologies are planned for transition to the Navy, Army and Air Force. The Dual Beam Lynx program will enhance the capabilities of the Lynx radar system to track slow-moving vehicles more accurately . The program modifies a Lynx I radar to create two beams with diffe rent phase centers and uses space time adaptive processing to det ect moving targets in the main beam clutter. The goals of this pr ogram include demonstrating improve ment in minimal detectable vel ocity, improving geolocation accuracy, and achieving a low manufacturing co st. The radar performance will be demonstrated from flight data collected from the radar flying on a UAV surrogate. Tec hnology is planned for transition to the Air Force. The Boreal program will develop and demonstrate a rapidly deploy ed, wide-area surveillance system for detection, tracking, prec ision location and engagement of high value target s under dense foliage. The Boreal system would be installed on a high flying fixed wing aircraft, and would rapidly search large areas for fixed and movi ng targets under foliage and provi de simultaneous Ground Movin g Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). The GM TI will detect and locate dismounts and vehicles moving under folia ge and the SAR will for reveal buildings, vehicles and lines of comm unications under foliage. The goa ls of this program include demonstrating real-time onboard wide-area GMTI and simulta neous SAR and achieving precise geolocation (7-10m) of moving dismounts.

It builds o ptics, gigapixel focal plane arrays, advanced laser radar technologies, embedded imag e processors, and video compression algorithms tailored to real-t ime detection, identification, and tracking of military targets. It emphasi zes materials and phenomenologies su itable for operations at night and with significant atmospheric absorption or obscuration due to foliage and camouflage. Programs in this thrust include: The Standoff Precision ID in 3-D (SPI 3-D) program is developi ng an affordable sensor package capable of high-resolution 3-D im ages for confirmatory target ID at long ranges (>10km) as well as fu ll field of view (FOV) ranging to support precise geolocation of targets. The system provides intensity, range and polarization information for each pixel in the field of view with each laser pulse. T he program includes a series of ground-based and airborne demonstrations of SPI-3D precision ID capabilities and track fusion techniques. The objectives are to provide: (1) high range resolution 3D imaging; (2) full FOV range to pixel determination; (3) multiple frame- to-frame registration of imagery, and (4) GPS-based cueing from search systems. Results w ill provide commanders with significantly impr oved long-range identification of enemy ground targets, as well as target ing information to support coordinate guided weaponry. The SPI-3D system employs optics and focal plane arrays and gimbals combined with a novel Pockels cell range measurement technique. The s ystem will operate in the near infrared spectral region to minimize observability. SPI-3D technologies are being designed to achieve a Class IV UAV-compatible (Predator, Firescout & Warrior) configuration fo r installation into a Multi-spectral Targeting System (MTS) turr et for transition to the Air Force at the conclusion of Phase III, which is anticipated to be completed by FY 2010. The program will also aid in Geiger Mode Avalanche Photodiode (GmAPD) technology transfer for the production of high speed, ultra sensitive photodetectors t o systems requiring operation at very low photon counts. This w ill support long range sensors that can detect highly obscured ta rgets ( 95%) under canopy/camouflage. The Advanced Optical Sensing program devel ops the next generation of airborne optical surveillance systems while also developin g and demonstrating the ability to obtain very high dynamic range, high resolution hyper-spectral and polarimetric information from a irborne imagers. The program focuses on bringing recent advances in pho tonic and other technologies to military airborne optical sensi ng systems. This effort develops advanced digital signal processing to support onboard image reconstruction, atmospheric correcti on and 485UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 54 Page 32 of 42 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 system calibration. Techniques are being explored to realize a large aperture wide-field-of-vie w imaging system within less th an half a meter of thickness. Adaptive optics techniqu es, such as those used for atmospheric corr ection, are being explored to help comb ine sub- apertures while relieving alignment requirements. While electroni c beam steering and zoom optics have been demonstrated with deformable mirrors and liquid crystal spatial light modulators, this program seeks to extend these technologies and make them p ractical for airborne surveillance systems. Technologies are planned for transition to the U.S. Army. The Large Area Coverage Search-wh ile-Track and Engage (LACOSTE) program enables pe rsistent tactical-grade Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) in dense urban areas. Wide-area continuous tr acking of moving vehicles requires very small coverage gaps, sm all resolution cells, and target separation and identification features. The ideal sensor has the area coverage rates of GMTI rada r and the resolution/identification capabilities of an electroptical infrare d system. The LACOSTE program will provide wide area surveil lance, simultaneous tracking, and target engagement with optical and infrared sensors fo r tactical GMTI operations. The program is de veloping a sensor with a very wide field of regard (90 \u00b0 cone angle), and a wide instantaneous fiel d-of-view (FOV) that is rapidly scanned in a search-while-track mode - tracking up to 10,000 targets in an urban area. Additionally, the LACOSTE sensor will provide next- generation precision tracking to enable engagement on a large num ber (~100) targets in dense urban areas within that same field of regard with a minimal penalty on the search-mode area coverage rate. Th e program is also developing a rapid \"zoom\" capability for tar get identification that enables feature-aided tracking through dense target environments plus sufficient target identification for separating like- targets when back-tracking a particular target via the histori cal track data. The LACOSTE technology is planned for transition to the Air Force and the Army at the conclusion of the program anticipated in FY 2009. Spatially Processed Image Detection and Rangi ng (SPIDAR) is a coherent imaging method that allows one to form a large effective optical aperture from a set of smaller, lighter telescopes provi ding for very high-resolution 3-D and 2-D ladar imagery of dist ant targets with a compact system configuration. This capability is very well suited for long-range engage ments from airborne or space-bas ed platforms and could significantly enhance the current synthetic aperture imaging a pproaches by providing the desired cross-rang e resolution along the axis perpendicular to the direction of trav el. This capability is also applicable on a small scale to pro vide very high resolution imagery in a compact and potentially man-portable confi guration for long-range ID. The gain in size, weight and pow er over more conventional lidar implementations w ill be assessed and demonstrated. The effort will improve performance of the technolo gy, specifically using diffuse reflective targets, targets with lower contrast and reduced intensity reference beam. Additionally, suitable missions and platforms for the technology w ill be identified. SPIDAR technologies will be transitioned to the Air Force in FY 2013. 486UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 54 Page 33 of 42 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 The Hyperspectral Framing program will develop and demonstrate a system for collecting and processing hyperspectral (HSI) data operating as a framing sensor, instead of as a line scanner with the constraints of cu rrent sensors. The system will accept wi de spectral content over hundreds of bands permitting extremely powerful air a nd space-borne reconnaissance for real time target detection. The resulting sensor and processing system will provide a 2-3 order of magnitude increase in the combin ation of area coverage rate and resolution, as well as a 1-2 order of magnitude decrease in sensor sy stem size and weight and power consumption.

Its products are installed on platforms that operate on the ground (HUMVEE, convoy elements) and near the ground (helicopters). They employ technologies that defeat or compensate for the unusual atmospheri c conditions near the surface (t urbulence, dust, strong propag ation losses) in order to provide timely and accurate detection and classification of dismounts, small vehicles, and terrain obstacles. Program s in this thrust include: The SandBlaster program will develop a passive pilot enhancement system that fuses visible, infrared (IR) and millimeter wave r adiation to enable multiple helicopters to land safely in conditions of severe brown- and white-out. SandBlaster will exploit the low a ttenuation property of dust (fog and snow) on millimeter wave radiation. A passive millimete r wave system will be developed to preclude d etection and prevent interference as would be expected from multiple activ e systems operated in close proximity. Four fundamental pilot ing situational awareness enablers will be addressed: (1) pilot's ability to \"see\" in li mited visibility conditions, (2) pilot's aw areness of helicopter drift, (3) pilot's awareness of slope of terrain, and (4) display technology matched to mission and human factors co nsiderations. The technology developed under this program will trans ition to SOCOM and the Marine Corps in FY 2008. The Super-Resolution Vision System (SRVS) program will develop a nd build a field prototype soldier-portable optical system that will demonstrate improved recognition and identif ication range over existing systems. Th e key technical innovation is exploitation of atmospheric turbulence-generated micro-lensi ng phenomena to generate images that are superior to diffraction-limited images. S RVS will facilitate new operational and tac tical opportunities for land forces. Through enha nced resolution imaging, SRVS will (1) exte nd target recognition and identification to decisively longer distances; (2) overcome atmospheric turbulence, which now limits the abilit y of high- resolution optics; and (3) increase target identification confid ence to reduce fratricide and/or collateral damage. It will cu lminate in a field demonstration of a prototype. Technology developed under this program will transition to Special Operations Forces in FY 2011. Polar Bear will provide a missile seeker that uses polarimetric processing and 3-D registration w ith target folders to generate precision terminal guidance. The system will sense polarimetric long-wave infrared signals generated by ta rget and background, derive th e surface shapes of the target and background and matc h the target shape to 3-D target folders. This will enhance target identification capabilities 490UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 54 Page 37 of 42 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2008 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 and enable precision aim-point selection on the target. The pr ogram will develop algorithms for surface normals and shape sign ature extraction from polarimetric data, develop tools for 3-D target folders, and develop software for real time onboard processing. The precision attainable by Polar Bear will be suitable for a kinetic -kill weapon and the sensor cost will be comparable to existen t uncooled infrared missile sensors. Technologies are pl anned for transition to the U.S. Army. The Short Wave Infrared through Fog and Cl ouds (SWIF) program will de velop and demonstrate advanc ed signal processing and optic al imaging technology to allow detection of co llision and grounding threats in fog and clouds at useful ranges (day or night). Th e obscurants substantially degrade performance in precis ion handling operations. Humans are able to operate successfully with sensor assist ance, but situational awareness significantly degrades. Successful developm ent of this technology will rest ore this situational awarenes s to tactically relevant distance and time scales. Significant technical obstacles that must be overcome include development of an ultra-short pulse laser with sufficent bandwidth and fast enough pulse rise ti me to create transient-like propagation characteristics in an aerosol cloud. This effort is planned for transition to the Navy and Air Force by FY 2012.

Pr ograms in this thrust include: The High Precision Long Range Laser Designator/Locator (HPLD) program seeks to develop an affordable laser target designator/lo cator package that allows the user to observe, track, and designate a target at operationally significant ranges. The focus of this effort is to investigate target-in-the-loop active optics approaches and novel high accuracy pointin g methods to enable a single operator to precisely determine the GPS coordinates of a target that is multiple kilo meters away. Once precisely determined, the operator would be a ble to observe, track, and laser designate the target as required, using a single device. This device would be used by ground combat elements and small unmanned aerial vehicles that conduc t terminal attack control and call for fi re and will be designed to support their full range of deployment methods.

This program is planned for transition to the Army and Marines in 2010. The Laser Geospatial Referencing (LGR) system will allow ground tr oops to designate targets for engagement by air forces where the pilot or UAV operator can see the designated spots within the field of view of their visible or forward looking infrared system . The LGR concept provides nearly instantaneous target location, iden tification and designation capabilities to weapon platforms supporti ng urban or other ground operations. The LGR concept enables these assets to be immediately directed by dismounted soldiers. LGR technolo gy could dramatically reduce the time required for targeting existing firepower in the form of man-portable missiles, light armor, tanks, artillery and ground attack aircraft. LGR t echnologies will be transitioned to the U.S. Army and Marine ground forces, and U.S . Air Force and Army Airborne Targeting Systems in FY 2013. The Sensor Tape program will develop and demonstrate a low-cost one-time-use low- power band-aid size adhesive-applied blast dosimeter that records accumulative blast effects for integration into combat medical care. Significant technical obstacles th at must be overcome include achieving adequa te switching frequencies, packaging, print-on i nk technologies and production costs.
