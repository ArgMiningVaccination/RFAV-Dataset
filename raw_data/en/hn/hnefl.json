Avoid alcohol or heavy food the day before and the day of the healing, preferably observe a vegan diet in order to receive the best benefits. Avoid food 3 hours before the healing. You should hydratate yourself very well before and after. Let us know if you suffer from any illness, allergies, diabetes, if you have heart problems, if you are taking antidepressant or any drugs. We suggest to receive the therapies at open air. Our therapists are mexican or international, let us know if you have any preference. We can reach any location in Riviera Maya. Transfer fees outside Playa del Carmen. You can decide to receive your treatment in a private Cenote or spiritual temple of tradition in Playa del Carmen. RECOMMENDATIONS You should receive healing on a empty stomach and being sure you drink at least 2 lt water all week, as you will be releasing toxins. This is by the way a great habit, drinking 2 lt of water every day is one of the best medicine! We suggest you as well to do some streching and move your joints the day before and the day after the cleansing. Again, this is a good habit on a daily basis. Think about an intention before you start your healing (something you would like to understand better about your life or you would like to achieve). The energy you will receive from the healer might in this way help you realizing something important for you.
