Shahnaz Husain explains why it is best to adopt Ayurveda. Long before complex beauty products were discovered, people solely used to depend on natural products for skincare. These ingredients were deeply rooted in the spices, herbs, and other green ingredients.

Ayurvedic texts contain details of a staggering number of natural substances, their medicinal properties, and usage. This is the reason why Ayurveda is still flourishing. The fact is, our skin and scalp have an extremely efficient ability to absorb what is applied to it. The sensitive skin, particularly, can experience an immediate allergic reaction to a cosmetic ingredient. Even if there is no sudden reaction, there can be a cumulative effect, with a build-up of chemical residues on the body. Some of the substances that have been known to leave an adverse effect on the body are: Don't Miss: [Make Full Use Of These Foot Care Remedies This Summer & Make Them Look Good Even In Slippers](https://www.herzindagi.com/beauty/summer-foot-care-remedies-by-shahnaz-husain-heal-cracked-heels-dryness-flip-flop-effect-article-159763) - Lead- A chemical mainly present in certain eye make-up products can have many ill effects. - The use of creams to massage on oily skin can lead to acne, pimple, or rash.

The good news is, today, we are not using ingredients like parabens, sulfates, mineral oil, or synthetic colours in our products. But, in case you have used any other products with such ingredients and if there is a severe reaction, you should seek medical care immediately. For mild allergic reactions, some natural ingredients may help, such as: Don't Miss: [Have Weak, Breakable hair?

Grind a handful of poppy seeds, add a little rose water to make a paste and apply on affected areas. One of the most beneficial ingredients are essential oils. They are used to formulate natural cosmetics. But, one has to learn how to mix them with carrier oils, mineral water, or rose water, in the prescribed proportions. You may try the following remedy. - Add 10 drops of Tea Tree Oil to 5 ml rose water. Apply directly on pimples/acne, with a cotton swab. - Add 10 drops of sandalwood oil to 100 ml rose water to make a skin tonic.
