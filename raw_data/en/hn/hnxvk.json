It is safe to use and has none of the side effects of many traditional medications, because it is made from the natural substances and is FDA regulated. Homeopathic medicines - known as \"remedies\" - are made from natural sources (e.g., plants, minerals), and are environmentally friendly and cruelty free. Homeopathic remedies when used as directed, are completely safe for everyone. They are given in such small doses that they don't cause side effects.* Homeopathy is not a general or \"umbrella\" term that describes a variety of different natural therapies. Although homeopathic remedies are derived from natural substances, homeopathy should not be confused with herbal medicine, Chinese medicine, or other types of natural medicines. It is its own, unique therapeutic system. The FDA's present policy does not require homeopathic medicines to go through the FDA approval process. The homeopathic ingredients monographed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States have been reviewed for homeopathic efficacy, toxicology, adverse effects and clinical use. The historical safety record with the use of homeopathic drugs, some for close to 200 years. The FDA drug monitoring process does not reveal any significant instances of problems with homeopathic drug products, thus establishing a positive safety profile. Homeopathy's Basic Principle: The Law of Similars It is accepted knowledge that every plant, mineral, and chemical can cause in overdose its own unique set of physical, emotional, and mental symptoms. It also is readily acknowledged that individuals, when ill, have their own idiosyncratic physical, emotional, and mental symptom patterns, even when people have the same disease. Homeopathic medicine is a natural pharmaceutical science in which a practitioner seeks to find a substance which would cause in overdose similar symptoms to those a sick person is experiencing. When the match is made, that substance then is given in very small, safe doses, often with dramatic effects. Homeopaths define the underlying principle for this matching process as the \"law of similars.\" The \"law\" is not unknown to conventional medicine. Immunizations are based on the principle of similars. No less a person as Dr. Emil Adolph Von Behring, the \"father of immunology,\" directly pointed to the origins of immunizations when he asserted, \"By what technical term could we more appropriately speak of this influence than by Hahnemann's word \"homeopathy.\" Homeopathy is a natural form of medicine used by over 200 million people worldwide. The holistic nature of homeopathy means each person is treated as a unique individual and their body, mind, spirit and emotions are all considered in the management and prevention of disease. Taking all these factors into account a homeopath will select the most appropriate medicine based on the individual's specific symptoms and personal level of health to stimulate their own healing ability. Homeopathic medicines are safe to use as they rarely cause side-effects. This means when used appropriately under the guidance of a qualified homeopath they can be taken by people "}
