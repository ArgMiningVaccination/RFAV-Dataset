The Space andSatellite Systems (SSS) Club has developed a CubeSat that laysthe foundation for low cost missions focused on Earth Science.This mission objective relies heavily on the problem of when tocollect data and ensuring the quality of our data. This isaccomplished through machine learning and information theoryand processing by the Computer Systems Team of SSS. Afterdedicated research, we have compared and contrasted threemethods for teaching our CubeSat: Linear Regression, LogisticRegression, and Support Vector Machine. Our results wereverified with mathematical optimization. We are developing anovel data set, which is highly sought after in Machine Learningresearch, to further test our methods. Future work will include anovel method that will not only teach the machine, but allow itto actively learn at low cost to our power systems. The Influence of Climate Variables and Disease on Plantago lanceolata Survival Lilly Ackerman Sponsor: Jennifer Gremer, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology This project is a continuation of a study on the globally-distributed perennial plant Plantago lanceolata that has beenconducted annually since 2016. Studying global P. lanceolatapopulations in relation to climate change helps to inform thedevelopment of persistence models. The protocol of Plant PopNet, an international project, was used to execute our study.Plant Pop Net aims to comprehend the factors driving the spatialdynamics of plant populations in response to climate changeusing data from P. lanceolata populations around the globe. Atour site in Davis, CA, we measured the abundance andphenotypic traits of P. lanceolata for five years. Data collectedincludes leaf length, inflorescence length, disease presence,and other phenotypic traits. We would like to investigate theinfluence of climate variables and disease on plant survival.Using compiled data, we will look at variation in precipitationand temperature to see if there is a correlation with yearly plantsurvival. In addition, yearly survival will be compared to theproportion of plants containing disease. We predict thatindividuals with disease will experience reduced survivalcompared to those without. Further, we expect higherprecipitation and temperature to result in increased survival.First There Was Nothing, Then...Luminescence: The Isolation of Individual [(C 6H11NC) 2Au]+ Ions in Crystals and Their Formation of Benzene Solvates Alexandria Adams Sponsor: Alan Balch, Ph.D. Chemistry Studies have form luminescent crystals that contain linear chains of cations and display unusual polymorphic, vapochromic, and thermochromic properties. The interest in developing thesetypes of environmentally responsive, luminescent metal-organiccompounds can be useful in areas of temperature sensing,biological imaging, and metal toxin detection. Different ways to isolate [(C 6H11NC)2Au]+ ions from one another through the formation of non-luminescent crystalline salts have been investigated. It has been found that the crystallization of[(C 6H11NC)2Au]EF6 (E = As, Sb) from benzene non-luminescent crystals of the solvates C6H6 [(C6H11NC)2Au]EF6. These solvates lose benzene upon standing in air, and in turn produce green luminescent([(C 6H11NC)2Au]AsF6) or blue luminescent ([(C6H11NC)2Au]SbF6) powders. Further investigation of these crystals involves mixedamounts of anions during crystallization, as well as the anion (PF 6)-, exploring different properties of their conversion from a benzene solvate to a powder. Expression and Function of Sox10 During Neural Crest Cell Biology Neural crest cells are embryonic stem cells that transition from a tightly adherent epithelial sheet to migratory and invasivemesenchymal cells. The epithelial to mesenchymal transition(EMT) is a crucial process in which neural crest cells gain theability to migrate out of the neural tube to become diversederivatives (craniofacial bone, pigment, neurons) in thedeveloping organism. Here, we study the molecular mechanismswithin and across species that drive the development and EMTof neural crest cells. Using immunohistochemistry, wecharacterize differential expression of Sox10 in relation to otherneural crest factors, Sox9, Snai2, and Pax7, across multipledevelopmental stages in developing chicken and quail embryos. Further, we perform loss- and gain-of-function studies todetermine if Sox10 is necessary and/or sufficient to drive theprocess of EMT. Our initial findings show that in chick embryos,Sox10 knockdowns reduce the neural crest cell population whileSox10 overexpression results in the gain of neural cadherin andSox9 at the expense of epithelial cadherin and Pax7 expression.Future work will focus on horizontal integration efforts andunderstanding the direct and indirect role of Sox10 during EMTand determining if its function is conserved between species. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 6Investigating Interfering Electric Fields Phenomenon to Stimulate Specific Regions of the Rat Brain Muhammad Afaq Sponsor: Min Zhao, M.D.,Ph.D. MED: Dermatology In brain stimulation therapy, Electric Fields (EF) are distributed in conductive and nonconductive brain regions and inefficientlystimulate cells. This leads to brain cells not responding to EFs.Stimulating specific brain regions with certain frequencies caninduce cellular response. This is achieved by stimulating thebrain with two EFs and causing interference which can stimulatea specific region in the brain. The purpose of this study is toform a more solid understanding of how Interfering ElectricFields (IEFs) behave in rat brains and how targeted stimulationcan be achieved from that understanding. This is accomplishedby running computer simulations with IEFs on rat brain atlasesgenerated from MRI and Nissl histology. The simulation resultswill be validated with experiments in which IEF behavior isstudied in cell cultures. The cell culture, when stimulated,induces a proliferation response which is viewed by conductingimmunofluorescence staining. IEF behavior will then beobserved in organotypic rat brain cultures which consider thethree-dimensional architecture and different layers of the brain.In conclusion, we studied how IEFs behave in rat brains usingdifferent techniques to achieve targeted brain stimulation. Thisunderstanding will help improve brain stimulation therapy ofdiseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Well-Being of the Asian Pacific Islander American (APIA) Population Ages 18-30 Residing in Yolo and Sacramento, California Noor Akhter Bohringer, M.D. MED: Anesth & Pain Medicine Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, is an infectiouscommunicable respiratory illness that has affected over 100,000people throughout Sacramento and Yolo County. During thepandemic, social distancing and lockdown measures were putin place to ensure the safety of our communities. Mental healthissues have become relatively common in the youth group dueto social isolation. Our aim is to investigate, to what degree hasCOVID-19 impacted the mental well-being of the Asian & PacificIslander American (APIA) community, ages 18-30, residing in theYolo County and Sacramento City/County, CA region comparedto the Caucasian population? Our online survey asksparticipants to rate statements based on their mental health,healthcare access, and academic performances. Our survey wasopened from January 20th, 2021 to February 3rd, 2021. Oursample group (n = 147) consisted of 32 participants identifying asCaucasian and 94 participants identifying as Asian/PacifierIslander. Our data suggest that Caucasian and APIAcommunities are experiencing depressive symptoms. However,the APIA community reported having a higher impact ofnegative effects related to depression, anxiety, mood, andstress levels. In conclusion, there should be more resources tosupport the APIA community regarding their mental well-being,especially during this time.Effects of cover crop management through tillage or grazing on the metabolic diversity of the soil microbial community in a Mediterranean vineyard Anthony Alameda Sponsor: Maria Lazcano Larkin, Ph.D. Land Air & Water Resources Cover crops are used in vineyards to improve infiltration andmitigate erosion but require management to preventcompetition with the vines. Tillage or sheep grazing are optionsto terminate cover crops but have tradeoffs by promoting orhindering soil microbial activity to different degrees. Soilmicroorganisms support decomposition and nutrient cyclingthus, are responsible for supporting soil health. We establisheda field experiment in a vineyard to study the effects of covercrop management on soil microbial activity. Cover crop residueincorporation into the soil through tillage was compared to non-tilled soils leaving the mowed cover crop on the soil surface;grazing effects were assessed using grazed versus non-grazedenclosures. Treatments were applied to 9.7 by 14.6-meter plots,with four plots per treatment. Three years after the trial set up(spring 2021), we collected soil samples at 0-15 cm and 15-30cm depths. Biolog EcoPlates were used to changes inthe community's metabolic profile. Higher microbial activity andmetabolic diversity are expected within the grazed treatmentand no-till treatment as the input of sheep waste providesnutrients and less disturbance occurring, respectively.Determining and implementing the best management methodscan keep other vineyard soils equally sustainable forgenerations. Preliminary Validation of an Observational Measure of Emotion Regulation for Individuals with Fragile X Syndrome Cameron Alexander Sponsor: Nicole Sparapani, Ph.D. Education Emotion regulation (ER) is the combination of physiological,behavioral, and emotional states that provide the tools neededto adapt through everyday situations. Studies often measure ERusing rating scales completed by a caregiver, potentiallyresulting in biased representations of ER. This study aims toexamine the construct validity of an observational measure ofER outlined in the Classroom Measure of Active Engagement(CMAE). Participants included 29 males with Fragile X Syndromebetween the ages of 15-22 who were recruited for alongitudinal study at the UC Davis MIND Institute. As part of thelarger study, video observations of the Autism DiagnosticObservation Schedule (ADOS) were collected, and parentscompleted a battery of questionnaires to measure anxiety andbehavior. Three trained raters coded ER using the ADOSobservations; interrater agreement was high Findingsindicated significant, positive correlations emotiondysregulation and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) readings (r = 0.622; p < 0.01), suggesting an association between ER and psychosocial stress expressed by the sAA recordings. Theassociations between ER with anxiety and behavior were notsignificant. These findings offer preliminary support for thevalidation of the ER construct outlined on the CMAE, andsubstantiate the role of physiological arousal in ER.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 7Bromide Effects on Pregnant Cattle and Parturition Orli Algranatti Sponsor: Wilson Rumbeiha, D.V.M.,Ph.D. VM: Molecular Bio Sciences Beef farmers feeding pregnant cattle bromide contaminated hay are perplexed by the increase of cows with dystocia at the timeof parturition. There is a knowledge gap of effects of bromide inpregnant cows. In this investigation, we hypothesized thatbromide causes dystocias. Pregnant cows are fed bromide intheir third trimester of pregnancy to assess toxicity and later thehealth of the newborn calves will be evaluated. There are 5study groups: Group 1, negative control, 0 ppm bromide (n=4).Group 50 ppm bromide 3, Group 5, 3200 ppm bromide in TMR(n=4). Comprehensive physical examinations, including bodyweight is performed every 7-14 days. Serum bromide isevaluated on days 0, 30, 60, 90 and weekly after parturition for4 weeks. Ultrasounds are performed monthly to assess thehealth status of the fetuses. Upon parturition, amniotic fluids willbe collected for bromide level measurements. At necropsy, liver,kidney, and muscle will be assessed for bromide levels. 30 daysinto the study, preliminary results show no bromide effects oncows or fetuses. Activated Microglia Stimulate Neurodegeneration in Non- Human Primate Model of Alzheimer's Addison Sponsor: John Morrison, Ph.D. MED: homeostasis through trophic support. Microglia a role in neurodegenerative diseases suchas Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that microgliamediate neuroinflammation and promote neuron death. To testthis, we targeted the entorhinal cortex (ERC) in the brains of 6rhesus monkeys. They received two injections of an adeno-associated virus expressing a double mutant tau known tocause tau-related pathology in humans (AAV-P301L/S320F, forsimplification AAV-2xTau) in the left hemisphere, and similarinjections of AAV-GFP in the right ERC as a control. Within 6months, we observed extensive tau-based neuropathology, withclear evidence of propagation of tau fibrils, similar to what ishypothesized to occur in AD patients. Usingimmunohistochemistry, we observed intense microglia activationand neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of the injectedanimals, supporting the hypothesis that microglia play a majorrole in the degenerative process observed in AD. The areaswith strong microglia activation corresponded with where taupathology was the most prominent. Learning more aboutmicroglia activation and its connection with AD can further ourunderstanding of how to treat or alleviate symptoms of thedisease.What are the Roles of Pitch Variation and Word Repetition in Infant Vocabulary Development? Mariam Ali Sponsor: Katharine Graf Estes, Ph.D. Psychology Infant-Directed Speech (IDS), also known as baby-talk, ischaracterized by higher pitch, longer word duration, a widerpitch range, and more word repetition in comparison to Adult-Directed Speech (ADS). Prior research suggests thatcomponents of IDS affect infants' language learning. However,we do not yet know how certain linguistic elements, such asvarying pitch and word repetition, contribute to infants'vocabulary development. The current study will investigatewhether infant vocabulary size correlates with parents' pitchrange and/or the number of target word repetitions the parentproduces. We will analyze audio recordings of monolingualEnglish-speaking parents playing with their infants (n= 24, ages:10-12 months) in a task designed to elicit 14 target words (e.g.,hat, apple, boat). We will count repetitions of each target wordand measure the pitch range for these target words for eachparticipant. We will collect infant vocabulary size via parentalreports on a standardized vocabulary form. We expect thatparents with high rates of target word repetition and wide pitchranges will have infants with the largest vocabularies. Ifconfirmed, these findings would suggest that certaincharacteristics of IDS can be targeted to promote betterlinguistic development in infants. Child Challenging Behaviors and Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Children with Fragile X Syndrome Hala Alkhatib Sponsor: Leonard Abbeduto, Ph.D. MED: Psychiatry & Behav Sci Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited cause ofintellectual disability and is caused by a mutation in the FMR1gene on the X chromosome. Male children with FXS oftenpresent with language delays, autism spectrum disorder (ASD),and behavioral challenges. However, the influence of FXSextends beyond the child to the greater family system. Parentsare likely to experience elevated parenting stress, which maynegatively influence relationships within the family and thechild's development and behavior. The present study wasdesigned to provide a fuller account of the possibility ofdifferential impacts on mothers and fathers of children with FXS.We compared maternal and paternal ratings of child challengingbehaviors using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-2 (ABC-2) andASD symptoms using the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2). Initial findings show that mothers endorsed higher ratings onthe ABC-2 compared to fathers. Additionally, most parents ratedASD symptoms as moderate or severe. Despite thesedifferences, there were strong and significant relationshipsbetween mothers' and fathers' ratings on both the ABC-2 andSRS-2. Future directions include investigating how thesecharacteristics influence parents' well-being. Understanding thefeatures that affect family relationships allows for the expansionof interventions dedicated to improving family well-being.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 8The Body's Role in Sufism Sophia Allen Sponsor: Naomi Janowitz, Ph.D. Religious Studies In Islam, the mystical tradition of Sufism is seen as an extreme yet effective way of coming into true union with God. SufiMuslims renounce the world and its pleasures in order to seek astate of ecstatic, intoxicating joy. This state only occurs inencounters with their \"beloved,\" a popular Sufi term for God.The experiences they describe liken to a kind of ego-death\u2014they become so aligned with God's being that their individualself ceases to exist. These divine encounters caused manySufi's to speak ?as? God in the first person, asserting that theonly true \"I\" is God. This intense identification with the Creatorindicates that their individual self had melted away in Hispresence. Despite their unity with God, they remain on earth inthe same physical bodies as prior to these events. This deepspiritual transformation prompts the question of how exactly thephysical vessel factors into the complete obliteration of the self.My thesis will explore how the body functions as a site ofconvergence of finite human identity and God's infinite nature,and how exactly the body is affected or regarded in theaftermath of union with God. Robot Strawberries: Economic and Labor Implications of Automation in the Strawberry Value Chain. CHRISTOPHER ALMARAZ Sponsor: Marjorie Visser, Ph.D. Human Ecology For the last 50 years, the economics and labor relations instrawberry production have attracted significant interest fromsocial scientists and economists. The demand for freshstrawberries continues to grow, but farm laborer availability fallsshort of demand. The farmers are seeking technology that cansubstitute for labor. Automation has already moved forward inmechanized mass crop harvestings such as tomatoes and, morerecently, in apples and bell peppers. However, planting, picking,and packing strawberries has unique challenges because oftheir delicacy and the need for human beings to evaluate theirripeness. With the development of image recognition, AI, andincreasingly sophisticated robots, previously considered manualtasks but non-routine are being threatened by automationmade possible by digitization. This research will examine theeconomic and labor impacts of automation in the strawberryvalue chain and study the engineers and researcherscontributing to the digitization process. Automation will affecteach step differently and different workers differently. Further,after many years of development, several robots havesuccessfully managed to replicate the human labor consistentwith harvesting strawberries. This research seeks to discern thetrends of automation in strawberry fields while also foreseeingimplications for the laborers, sustainability, and the strawberryindustry.The Synergetic Effect of Analytical Theory, Numerical Methods, and Experiments With Regards to Bernoulli's Law Faiza Alvi Sponsor: Mohamed Hafez, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The purpose of this research project is to observe thesynergetic effect of combining theory, numerical analysis, andexperiments when explaining engineering concepts. It expandsbeyond the analytical theory by showing the efficacy ofnumerical methods in achieving the same results as theanalytical theory with less effort. The physical experiments alsoplay a crucial role\u2014they illustrate the theoretical concepts on atangible level that makes them simpler to both observe andunderstand. This project discusses Bernoulli's law forincompressible and compressible flow. The first experimentshows how Bernoulli's law can be effectively modeled forincompressible flow with simple household items. The otherexperiments model compressible flow in two ways; one whichaccount for shock in a nozzle and one which does not. Theexperiments prove that while the numerical analysis does havesome discretization error, it mimics the analytical results fairlyaccurately. The implications of this project are to illustrate howthe gaps in theoretical analysis can be filled by using alternativetechniques. In this case, physical experiments and numericalmethods enrich the theoretical components of these conceptsand show how the theory can be implemented on a practicalapplication basis. Examining Speech Toward Alexa versus humans: A comparison of adults and children Ava Anderson Sponsor: Georgia Zellou, Ph.D. Linguistics Voice assistants such as Alexa and Siri are now commonly usedin the home and everyday life, yet our scientific understandingof these interactions is still in its infancy. This study tests howpeople of different ages (college-age adults and children, ages7-12) talk to an Alexa device versus a human. The interactions,conducted over Zoom due to social distancing restrictions, werecontrolled so that participants said the same sentences to theAlexa and human interlocutors. Subjects see a list of 24 wordsand, on each trial, the experimenter or device asks what thenext word on the list is. The subject replies with thecorresponding word on their list (\"The word is pig\"). Then, theexperimenter or device says the word back and asks the subjectto repeat the sentence; on 4/24 of trials, the interlocutormishears the pronunciation, saying a second word with aconsonant error (\"I heard pig or pick\"). Videos are annotated inELAN and manually checked. We predict that adults andchildren will show differences in the way they adjust theirspeech for a human versus Alexa interlocutor. Broadly, this workcan reveal the impact of voice assistants on language behavioracross the lifespan.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 9Evaluating the Impact of Agricultural Waste Products on Enteric Methane Production in vitro Elizabeth Anderson Sponsor: Matthias Hess, Ph.D. Animal Science Ruminant livestock production is a major contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in theform of enteric methane (CH 4) production. Enteric CH4 is the result of microbial fermentation of feed within the foregut ofruminant animals. One promising strategy to reduce enteric CH 4 without compromising animal productivity is the dietary additionof plant material with anti-methanogenic properties. In recentyears some agricultural byproducts, such as grape andpomegranate pomace, have shown CH 4 mitigation potential. In addition to reducing overall CH4 emissions, rerouting agricultural waste from the landfill into animal productionsystems would reduce both total feed costs for livestockproducers and the environmental footprint of food production.This project's objective is to evaluate regionally-generatedagricultural waste products for their potential to reduce entericCH 4 production using an artificial (in vitro) rumen system. I will present results from our screening efforts to evaluate themethane mitigating potential of byproducts from cherry, coffee,hazelnut, onion, pistachio, and walnut processing and from beerbrewing. These results will provide first indications of which ofthese byproducts should be explored for their CH 4 reducing potential in vivo. A Comparative Study of Thyroid Hormone-Associated Regulated Gene Expression in the Xenopus Sponsor: John Furlow, Ph.D. Neuro Physio & Behavior During brain development, thyroid hormone (TH) plays a vitalrole in regulating gene transcription via its two forms, T4 andT3, guiding processes that shape the brain for optimal functionthroughout the lifetime. Past research in rodent models soughtto identify the TH signaling pathway components and regulatedgenes in the developing brain, but many of the specifics,particularly direct transcriptional targets of T3, remain unknown.The aim of this study was to use transcriptomic data from T3-treated Xenopus laevis tadpole brains to characterize the geneexpression profile in this amphibian model of TH action, incomparison to other vertebrates. As hypothesized, we foundthat many known regulators of TH, such as thyroid hormonereceptors a and \u00df, deiodinases 2 and ncoa1, were the Xenopus brain transcriptome. Additionally, we identified ahandful of genes previously recognized as direct targets of THin mammalian systems, most notably klf9. These results providefurther evidence that TH signaling in the brain is conservedacross species, and suggest the presence of a core group ofgenes that are consistently targeted by T3 amidst its otherwisebroad array of transcriptional targets.Iel, Ramanathan Sponsor: Eric louis Russell, Ph.D. French & Italian In languages with grammatical gender, people who identify outof the gender binary are given two choices: to use thegrammatical male/female form or create a third gender-neutraloption. With more people identifying as non-binary, there is aneed for appropriate forms. My research examines the creationand use of gender-neutral language in French, focusing onsocial media. I began by gathering data from 5-10 FrenchInstagram accounts that discuss LGBTQIA+ activism to see whatchanges are being proposed. The most frequent modificationswere the use of iel/ael pronouns, alongside canonical il/elle. After pronoun usage, the most common information presentedwas about making nouns and adjectives gender-neutral. Thismostly dealt with the written form, with next to none of theseposts mentioning a way to convert this method to spokenFrench. After observing the writing forms used by most of theseaccounts, using a period to condense words with bothmasculine and feminine forms into one is the most commonmethod, which would result in forms like m\u00e9decin to becomewritten like m\u00e9decin.e. However, the aforementioned details arenot uniform across accounts, causing confusion, and possiblylowering the usage of such writing in online spaces. Measuring the Effectiveness of Undergraduate Teaching Assistants to Analyze Differences in Instruction in Chemistry Laboratories Xavier Antoine-Goeas Sponsor: Ozcan Gulacar, Ph.D. Chemistry Beginning in Fall 2017, the Chemistry Department at UCDavis established a pilot program through which undergraduateteaching assistants, formally known as Emerging Scholars (ES),are introduced into laboratory settings to work alongsidegraduate teaching assistants (TA). To study the differences instudent interactions with the TAs and the ESs, every TA and ESwas asked to audio record their conversations during two labsessions. After the audio data were collected, they were firsttranscribed, and student interactions with the lab instructorswere coded using Laboratory Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (LOPUS). Findings of this study will reveal whether students are more comfortable approaching TAs orESs, and how the teaching styles may vary between the two labinstructors. Student inquiries and TA's or ES's responses will becarefully examined to better understand the instructional stylesin the labs. These observations and analyses will reveal theefficacy of the Emerging Scholars program and provide insighton methods to enhance student learning experiences. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 10Effects of Milk Osteopontin on Bone Development During Infancy Lam Ao Sponsor: Bo Lonnerdal, Ph.D. Nutrition Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein that has been identified in bone matrices and plays essential roles in bonedevelopment, including bone formation. OPN is also found inhigh amounts in human milk, which associates positively withbone development. With a high concentration of OPNappearing in mouse milk, effects of milk OPN on bonedevelopment during infancy were evaluated using ourestablished OPN KO mouse model. Wild-type (WT) mouse pupswere nursed WT dams (WT group) or OPN KO dams (KOgroup) from postnatal day 1 to 21 (P1-P20). The effects of milkOPN on bone development were assessed in P20 mouse pupsby ELISA and histological analysis. The results showed that WTand KO mouse pups had similar body weights, and tibia andfemur lengths. Compared to the KO group, the WT group hadhigher concentrations of plasma OPN and P1NP (a marker forbone formation). Consistently, more OPN stained cells werefound in the femurs of pups from the WT group than in thosefrom the KO group. These results suggest that milk osteopontinis associated with developmental processes of the bone,including bone formation. Incidental Findings found on Abdominal Imaging performed for General Surgery Patients Amanda Aquilio Sponsor: Michael Campbell, M.D. MED: Surgery The use of computerized tomography (CT) imaging hasincreased, leading to a rise in the identification of incidentalfindings (IF). Inappropriate follow-up of IFs can lead to poorpatient outcomes, delayed treatment and increased costs. Therate of patient awareness and follow-up of IFs has not beenevaluated in patients admitted to an acute care surgery (ACS)service. We conducted a review of ACS patients with a primarycare provider (PCP) admitted from January 2014 to December2019. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence andrate of appropriate follow up of IFs. 2047 patients met inclusioncriteria and 163 (8%) were included in this interim analysis. 80(49%) patients had a PCP. 30 (24%) patients received additionalfollow-up of their IF. Of the patients receiving follow-up, 9 (30%)had a recommendation for follow-up highlighted in the report oftheir index CT scan. 48 (60%) patients had the IF included intheir discharge summary. 16 (53%) were referred to a specialist,with (2) 3% of patients ultimately having a life-threatening IF. IFsare common in the ACS population. Despite efforts to informpatients of their IF, the majority of ACS patients do not receiverecommended follow-up.Applications of Computational Homology to the Analysis of Copy in Breast Cancer Perla Aramburu Sponsor: Francisco Arsuaga, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio How can cancer induced alterations in chromosome copynumber and their corresponding gene expression change bedetected? In the human body nearly two trillion cells divideevery day to produce new cells. During these cell divisionsmistakes occur and affect the DNA sequence structure orchromosomes. Alterations in the DNA can cause more than 10different types of cancers we know today. Among those, breastcancer affects 200,000 people per year in the U.S. and is thesecond largest cause of death for women. Our work focuses ondeveloping mathematical methods for copy number changesand gene expression profiling. We study how these twodifferent data sets identify important alterations by applyingboth mathematical and statistical methods such as algebraictopology and statistical genetics. The data we analyze consistsof array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), and geneexpression profiles for a collection of breast cancer samples.Our ultimate goal is to identify cancer genes whose expressionis regulated by copy number. The role of EYES ABSENT protein in Drosophila melanogaster seasonal reproductive physiology. Ana Armenta Vega Sponsor: Joanna Chiu, Ph.D. Entomology/Nematology Organisms undergo physiological and behavioral changesbased on seasonal-dependent such asvariations in photoperiod, i.e. daylength, or temperature.Reproductive dormancy is a seasonal adaptation observed ininsects characterized by an arrest in reproductive organdevelopment driven by shortening photoperiod as winterapproaches. EYES ABSENT (EYA) protein has been shown toparticipate in regulating seasonal responses, includingreproductive dormancy in Drosophila. EYA expression in insulin-producing cells within the pars intercerebralis, insect brainregion analogous to the mammalian hypothalamus, promotesreproductive dormancy in response to simulated winterconditions in the laboratory. How EYA expression inreproductive tissue regulates seasonal reproductive physiologyhas not been investigated. The Chiu lab has shown that EYAproteins are expressed in the follicle cells of Drosophila ovariesin addition to the brain suggesting that EYA expression in theovaries could also respond to seasonal cues and play a role inlocal regulation of ovarian development. I useimmunocytochemistry to quantify and characterize EYAexpression patterns in Drosophila ovaries in response tophotoperiodic and temperature changes. This will help us betterunderstand the role of EYA in seasonal reproductive physiology,potentially adding information about the interplay betweenneuronal and local regulation in organismal seasonality.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 11Learning to Look in a Pandemic: An Exploration on the Impact of Masks on Infant Facial Recognition Maria Arms Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology From birth, infants preferentially look to the faces in their environment. Across the first year of life, infants prioritizedifferent regions of the face (e.g., the eyes or mouth) as variousvisual cues become more or less relevant. For example, asinfants learn language, they may prioritize their attention to themouth of a speaker (Lewkowicz & Hansen-Tift, 2012). As aresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have become apart of daily life for many Americans, raising the question: willface masks affect our ability to recognize one another? Studiesinvestigating this question have found that adults are impairedat both learning and recognizing faces with masks (Carragher &Hancock, 2020). Given the importance of faces for infants'learning, we tested whether infants would show differentiallearning and recognition patterns to masked and unmaskedfaces. Additionally, we asked parents to report on their infant'sexperience seeing people wear face masks. To date, we havetested approximately 50 infants aged 4- to 12-months onlineand are currently analyzing this data to present in the Spring.This work will contribute to our understanding of how variousaspects of facial input are related to infants' learning across thefirst year of life. Demand for Type 2 Diabetes Management via Telehealth Services in Vulnerable Latino Communities Christina Arredondo-Lopez Sponsor: Lorena Garcia, Ph.D. MED: Public Health Sciences the SARS-CoV- 2 pandemic and currentrestrictions on in-person care, there has been increasingdemand for technology-based alternatives to seeking diabeteshealth care management services. There is scarce researchfocusing on chronic disease management via telehealthservices. The objective of this study was to determine thepotential effects of telehealth in older, low-income Latinopeople in Mexican and Mexican American communities, whichare disproportionately affected by diabetes. Methods: Asystematic literature review was conducted. Telehealthencompasses short messaging services, video conferences, andinternet surfing. Articles were pulled using these keywords onPubMed: \"diabetes, older adults, telehealth, Latino.\" Results: Text messages are just as effective as in person programs thatuse the diabetes self-management education program.Amplifying medication information to patients via teleconferencewas likely to reach a broader audience of patients whootherwise may not have sought medical advice, both due to itseasily accessible features and inexpensive method. Providingonline medical resources such as diagrams, animations, andvideos maximized health literacy and amplified anunderstanding of the disease. Conclusion: To minimize socialstigma on technology and improve health literacy in Latinocommunities, readily available access and utilization to technicalassistance and resources must be established.Mechanical and Thermal Analysis of CubeSat Structure for Simulated Launch and Orbital Environments Jacqueline Arroyo Donjuan Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The Space and Satellite Systems (SSS) club's REALOP missionis to create a 2U launch in 2021.

With racial tensions rising, manymay be exposed to racial discrimination online. These negativeexperiences may shape college students' expectations of futuresocial environments. Drawing on data from a longitudinal studyfollowing college students, this study examines the relationshipbetween exposure to negative representations of one'sethnicity/race in digital media and their perceptions of theirfuture career environment. Participants were 227 to untrue statements about your ethnic/racial group ondigital media is positively associated with expecting to betreated differently in your career because of your ethnicity/race(r = .16, p = .02), expecting to experience difficulty getting hired because of your ethnicity/race (r = .25, p < .001), and expectingto experience ethnic/racial discrimination in your career (r = .16,p = .02). These findings highlight how exposure to racist digitalmedia can lead to expectations of discrimination in one's futureworkplace environment. Future analyses will consider multipletime points and disaggregate findings across ethnic-racialgroups. Parenting Effects on Language Development in Mexican- American and Chinese-American Dual Language Learners Man Ling Au Sponsor: Yuuko Tonkovich, Ph.D. Education Past research has found mixed results on the relation betweenparenting styles and the development of young children'slanguage skills. More research is needed with dual languagelearners (DLLs) to promote bilingual development, especially tomaintain their heritage language skills. This project wasanchored to examine parenting styles and practices in familieswith DLLs and to investigate the association between parentingstyles (authoritarian and authoritative) and parenting practices(amount of parent-child activities) and their collective effects onMexican American (MA) children and Chinese American (CA)DLLs' oral comprehension and vocabulary retention of heritagelanguage, controlling for confounders of parental languagedominance and parental educational levels. Data were collectedfrom a total of 55 MA and 64 CA DLLs enrolled in Head Startprograms and their first-generation parents. Parenting Stylesand Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) and demographic surveywere completed by parents to investigate parenting styles andparenting practices. MA and CA DLLs were assessed on theirheritage language oral proficiency. Preliminary results suggestthat parenting styles and practices were similar for MA and CAparents and parenting practices were more associated withchildren's heritage language development than parenting styles.Implications for families will be discussed. Diversity Examined: A Metaanalysis of Ralstonia solanacearum . Lowe-Power, Ph.D. Plant Pathology Ralstonia solanacearum is a major bacterial phytopathogen thatcauses bacterial wilt and attacks a plethora of crops with thepathogen having a wide geographical range. This study's aim isto develop a database of the extensive diversity of R.solanacearum strains. To do this we are currently examiningliterature consisting primarily of studies perform 16S sequencingin order to determine a particular strain's phylogenetic identify.We then synthesize the information from the studies in order toascertain a strain's associated phylotype/sequevar and theirgenetic accession numbers. We also record a strain's pertinentinformation such as its geographic location, year of isolation andits isolation host. Through this database we investigate therelationships between these strains and develop phylogenetictrees that could better illustrate these relationships and theirorigins. I have catalogued the isolation locations, isolation hostsand phylotype-sequevars of 968 distinct strains. The strainswere isolated from 192 locations, 61 distinct hosts, and wereidentified as members of 38 distinct sequevars. Work on thisstudy continues as we examine more literature and synthesizeinformation that will help to detail and categorize the manystrains of R. solanacearum and the relationships between thedistinct strains. Spatial Organization (CoQ) is a redox lipid synthesized withinmitochondria and is essential for the electron transport chainand oxidative phosphorylation- a primary source of ATP ineukaryotic cells. Consequently, CoQ deficiency is linked tonumerous human diseases --including encephalopathy, liverfailure, and myopathy. Recently, discovered thatcomponents of the CoQ biosynthetic pathway selectivelyassemble in a manner dependent on CoQ production intomitochondrial inner membrane-associated domains, enriched atER-mitochondrial contact sites. We hypothesize that CoQdomains are required for the efficient processive production anddistribution of CoQ in cells. To further our understanding aboutCoQ assembly and their structural organization, we aredetermining the stoichiometry of endogenously expressedfunctional GFP-tagged Coq proteins within domains. The CoQprotein copy number will be determined by comparing GFPfluorescence intensity to a standard of a known copy number,which is the centromeric protein Cse4-GFP. This data will allowus to determine the relative stoichiometries of Coq proteins andthus will provide us insight into the structure of CoQ domainsand their assembly.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 13Associations of Nutritional Data and Glycemic Variability in Patients with Kidney Disease Roshanravan, M.D. MED: Int Med Nephrology (sac) Sarcopenia, defined as a decrease in muscle mass or function, is highly prevalent in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD). Insulin resistance, considered the primary mechanismleading to sarcopenia in patients with CKD, can manifest asimpaired glucose homeostasis. The purpose of this study is tomeasure glycemic variability in patients with moderate to severeCKD and its association to nutritional data collected from dietaryrecalls. Patients, part of the ESTEEM-CKD study, wore acontinuous glucose monitor (CGM) for an average of 14 days.Time in target was determined to be between 70 mg/dL to 140mg/dL. Within the CGM period, 3 dietary recalls were performedusing the ASA24 software. Dietary variables collected includetotal kilocalories, carbohydrates, fiber, protein, and fat. Variablescollected from the CGM include mean glucose, mean time intarget, and mean time below and above target. Dietary data wasexamined in comparison to the mean time in target values.Additionally, diet quality was assessed with the use of theHealthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015). This will further ourunderstanding of the association between dietary recalls anddata obtained from 2-week continuous glucose monitor. Examining Speech Toward Alexa versus humans: A comparison of adults and children Alessandra Bailey Sponsor: Georgia Zellou, Ph.D. Linguistics Voice assistants such as Alexa and Siri are now commonly usedin the home and everyday life, yet our scientific understandingof these interactions is still in its infancy. This study tests howpeople of different ages (college-age adults and children, ages7-12) talk to an Alexa device versus a human. The interactions,conducted over Zoom due to social distancing restrictions, werecontrolled so that participants said the same sentences to theAlexa and human interlocutors. Subjects see a list of 24 wordsand, on each trial, the experimenter or device asks what thenext word on the list is. The subject replies with thecorresponding word on their list (\"The word is pig\"). Then, theexperimenter or device says the word back and asks the subjectto repeat the sentence; on 4/24 of trials, the interlocutormishears the pronunciation, saying a second word with aconsonant error (\"I heard pig or pick\"). Videos are annotated inELAN and manually checked. We predict that adults andchildren will show differences in the way they adjust theirspeech for a human versus Alexa interlocutor. Broadly, this workcan reveal the impact of voice assistants on language behavioracross the lifespan. Correlations Among Health Variables in the Punjabi-Sikh Community Kavenpreet Bal Sponsor: Marina Crowder, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio The Punjabi-Sikh population, originating from Northern India,faces vast amounts of health disparities that are exacerbated bygenetic predispositions, immigration difficulties, culturalassimilation, language barriers, and a preference for traditionalSouth Asian cuisine. This community is severely understudied,despite suffering from disproportionate amounts of chronicconditions, including but not limited to diabetes mellitus,obesity, cancer, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. Inthe status quo, very low amounts of published studies,information, or data sets exist pertaining to the Punjabi-Sikhcommunity, which has undoubtedly contributed to the steadydecline in health equity. Health implications and variables forthis patient population in the United States, and California inparticular, have not been explored as intensively, despiteharboring a large relative percentage of the Punjabi-Sikhcommunity. Building upon the limited yet vital pre-existingliterature, it is essential to evaluate correlations among health-related variables for the Punjabi-Sikh community in the GreaterSacramento area to furnish patient care and improve methodsof health intervention. Utilizing regression analyses, thisresearch takes an incumbent step to increase the representationof this community within medicine while enabling the scientificcommunity to develop more effective health interventiontechniques. Amino Acid Proportions of Na+/H+ Antiporter Kavenpreet Fisheries Halophiles can have multiple Na+/H+ antiporters due to theirexposure to extreme levels of salinity and the course ofevolution. Studies have articulated why Na+/H+ antiporters areessential to in a high salinity environment andcreating new adaptations while trying to reproduce requiresvast amounts of energy. Halophiles increased the number ofNa+/H+ antiporters they had to increase the amount of Na+/H+they could bring across their membrane. The Na+/H+ antiporterserves to maintain homeostasis while utilizing chemiosmosis,enabling the activation of the Proton Motive Force and ATPSynthase to fuel ATP production. Large concentrations of saltimpact the hydrophobic interactions and covalent bonding ofproteins, affecting their structure and folding. However,hydrophobic amino acids can shield protein charges anddecrease salinity impact on protein structure. Analyzing theamino acid proportions among halophiles versus non-halophilesprovides information to discern whether significant differencesexist in the prevalence of hydrophobic amino acids.Additionally, it will help determine the relationship betweenhydrophobic amino acids, such as isoleucine, and high salinityenvironments. Analyzing salinity impact on halophilic proteinscan be used to better understand halophiles and ultimately treathypersaline waste.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 14State-level Variation in Sex Education Policies and Implications for Sexually Transmitted Infections Eve Banas Sponsor: Damien Caillaud, D.V.M.,Ph.D. Anthropology In the United States, nearly half of sexually transmitted infection (STI) cases occur in adolescents and young adults. Americansex education curricula vary widely across each state, raisingconcerns about education quality. Today, 40 states require thatabstinence advice be included during sex education, despitethe demonstrated lack of efficacy of this approach. Some statesnever mandate sex education in school. This study examinesthe correlation between sex education policies on STIdiagnoses in the U.S. over nearly two decades (2001-2018).Using data on Chlamydia trachomatis infection, Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, and HIV diagnoses from the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention, we analyzed the infection ratein people aged 13-24. Our data reveal considerable variation inSTI prevalence among states and rising infection rates acrossthe country. We predict lower STI prevalence in states withmandated sex and STI education and that the addition ofpolicies promotes this decline. It is important to evaluatewhether our current sex education policies produce tangiblechanges in transmission. If certain policies have little impact onSTI prevalence, new strategies need to be developed. Ourfindings can help inform public health and education policies toensure effective sex education is available across the country. Parental Scaffolding Prepares Groundwork for Children to Thrive with Executive Functions Antoinette Banks Sponsor: Yuko Munakata, Ph.D. Psychology Executive function skills (EFs) are essential for a child toprioritize daily tasks, control impulses, filter distractions, andaccomplish milestones. EFs continuously develop over thelifespan. Importantly, research has demonstrated that parentalscaffolding behaviors have long-term links with thedevelopment of children's cognitive abilities. As parents tailortheir teaching and support styles to their child's needs, theyessentially act as the \"executive\" in completing the task until thechild's EFs are strong enough to complete the taskindependently. The effectiveness of scaffolding hinges on thecontingency rule: when the child struggles, the parent raises thelevel of support given. When the child succeeds, the parentslowly reduces the amount of support given. A meta-analysiswill therefore be conducted to determine the strength of therelation between various parental scaffolding techniques andexecutive functions. This analysis seeks to explore thecorrelation between parental scaffolding behaviors andchildren's executive function development.A Quantitative essential to living things, especially in thediet and metabolism of humans. It is therefore important todevelop good analytical methods to study and understand them.This experiment looks into one procedure using Fenton'sinitiation toward defined oligosaccharide groups (FITDOG) tobreak down polysaccharides. Broccoli and soy flour sampleswere spiked with either one or a pool of seven knownoligosaccharide standards, then reduced with sodiumborohydride. Next, the samples went through a high-performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight (HPLC-QTOF) mass spectrometer to identify and quantifythe compounds found within them. Here, I validated thequantification of the oligosaccharide spikes by comparing theiractual concentrations with those calculated from HPLC-QTOFpeak areas. Results yielded a wide range of percent recoveriesfor each compound. In samples spiked with lowerconcentrations of maltohexaose or arabinohexaose only,percent recovery values for these two oligosaccharidesexceeded 80%. In contrast, samples spiked with a pool of all 7standards resulted in much lower percent recoveries for thosecompounds, ranging from 30% to 70%. This indicates that theprocedure must be further optimized to obtain a higher percentrecovery in complex matrices of oligosaccharides. Technical Development and Assembly of a Modular Cubesat Xiao-Bao Bao Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The REALOP CubeSat of the University of California, Davis teamutilizes a new design that is modular and provides more accessto internal payload components. To achieve ease ofaccessibility and modularity, the structures team designedmounting brackets and a unique printed circuit board (PCB)housing unit that are easy to modify and reorganize withouthaving to take apart the whole satellite assembly. The assemblypreparation team is currently working towards a standardizedintegration plan that carefully documents the process ofassembling each payload component. A database of well-organized and detailed documents was made to tackle themultiple challenges in developing an assembly procedure thatindependently integrated each of the critical payloadcomponents, PCBs, and wire routes with the structural frame.The assembly will consist of installing deployment switches,payload components and their respective mounting brackets, X-faces, Y-faces, Z-faces, and finally solar panels. These newdesigns and standardized integration documents will be usedfor future CubeSat missions and testing.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 15Site Specific N-glycoproteomic Analysis of Human Serum for modification important for mediating cellular processes critical to thedevelopment and function of organisms. Glycosylation defectscould alter human physiological conditions resulting in diseasedevelopment and progression. An altered glycosylation hasbeen identified in the hallmark proteins associated withAlzheimer's disease (AD). The major neuropathologicalhallmarks of AD include neurofibrillary tangles formed by theabnormal accumulation of Tau protein and amyloid plaquesformed by the extracellular aggregation amyloid \u00df-peptide (A\u00df).These plaques and tangles disrupt cell function andcommunication between neurons culminating in progressivedamage to the brain, particularly to the brain region involved inmemory. Current AD diagnosis relies on evaluating symptomsand documenting cognitive decline, but by then changes in thebrain have caused irreversible brain damage. Identifyingbiomarkers that detect AD in its early stages offers the potentialof early intervention. By using mass spectrometry specifically,the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method we canquantitively monitor 200 glyco-sites across 50 brain serumglycoproteins. While the quantitative data analysis is ongoing,this study has the potential to identify down or up regulatedglycoproteins in AD for biomarker discovery. Enemies of Order, Enemies of Progress: Indemnification and the Abolition of Brazilian Slavery, 1883-1888 Jake Barrett Sponsor: Jose Perez Melendez, Ph.D. History From 1879 to 1888, abolitionists in Brazil waged a nationalcampaign against the institution of slavery. Elite reformers andradical journalists formed coalitions with working-class activistsand enslaved Afro-Brazilians ultimately securing the legalabolition of slavery on May 13, 1888. The central platformespoused by the national abolitionist movement from 1883 to1888 was \"immediate abolition without indemnification,\" aplatform hostile to both gradual abolition and the right ofslaveholders to demand indemnification from the state foremancipated slaves. This paper utilizes newspapers,publications from abolitionist and proslavery organizations, andparliamentary debates to examine indemnification wasused by abolitionists and proslavery coalitions alike tocharacterize their opposition as enemies of the Brazilian nation-state. For advocates of immediate and uncompensatedabolition, those demanding indemnification were morallydegraded enemies of progress. For advocates of compensated,gradual abolition, those who condemned indemnification wereenemies of order and property rights. This paper focuses on thecentral discursive and legislative importance of indemnificationduring the abolitionist campaign from 1883 to 1888, whereaspast scholarship has largely considered indemnification inpassing (as a facet of the broader abolitionist campaign), or inthe context of the post-abolition destruction of slaveholders'financial records in 1890.Bioinformatics Analysis of Novel Genes Associated With Tomato Fruit Postharvest Quality Raymond Barsch Sponsor: Diane Beckles, Ph.D. Plant Sciences Tomatoes are universally popular, high in fiber and antioxidants,and are revered for the 'authenticity' they add to many culturaldishes. However, consumers have expressed unhappiness withthe quality of store-bought tomatoes, because trades-offs madewith respect to enhancing shelf-life and optimizing quality. Toprolong shelf-life, tomatoes may be harvested before they reachfull ripe and stored for variable periods before consumption,conditions that destroy fruit quality compared to fruit harvestedwhen ripe. The genes that are affected by different postharveststorage conditions have not been fully characterized, but abetter understanding of their mode of action may help toimprove tomato quality. Transcriptomics and methylomics wereused to identify genes whose expression changed in concertwith changes in tomato fruit quality due to different postharvesthandling. Several differentially expressed genes were identified,many of which have not been previously implicated in tomatofruit quality. In this work, we initiated a bioinformatic analysis ofthese genes and their cognate gene families, in tomato andother species, to determine if they are universally involved infruit quality or ripening. This is the first step towards theirfunctional analysis in fruit, using reverse genetics approaches,and long-term improvement in commercial fruit quality. Establishing the RXR Ligand Regulated Gene Network in the Developing Basas Behavior receptor (RXR) is a nuclear receptor (NR) involvedin important functions such as metabolism, reproduction, anddevelopment by dimerizing to other NRs, including thyroidhormone receptors (TRs) and liver X receptors (LXRs), amongothers. Highly expressed in the brain, RXR is also thought toplay a role in central nervous system development and function;however, little is known about RXR regulation of specific genenetworks in the brain. To discover RXR regulated genes, wetreated Xenopus laevis (African clawed two RXR and in combination with T3, which isknown to remodel the brain at metamorphosis. At two timepoints, we determined gene expression differences by focusingon genes more highly expressed upon RXR agonist treatment orinhibited by RXR antagonists. Detailed transcriptomic dataanalysis is currently underway, and thus far we have identifiedapolipoprotein E (a known RXR-LXR heterodimer regulatedgene in other organs), and the glia-specific fatty acid bindingprotein 7 gene as regulated genes of particular interest. Ouranalysis will establish RXR dependent gene expressionpathways in the brain and indicate the relevant RXR-NRpartnerships to study further.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 16California Fever: Madness in Gold Rush Era California Danielle Baza Sponsor: Gregory Downs, Ph.D. History The development of California's mental institutions coincided with the birth of a new state, one that blossomed out of disarrayand in face of a sudden influx of people. Nineteenth centurypopular culture and doctors defined \"insanity\" in extremelyambiguous terms, effectively construing mental illness as anybehavior that disrupted society. Through the lens of writings byDr. Robert Reid, resident physician of the Stockton StateHospital, my work examines one perception of mental illnessand the way that California's approach to mental health createdan atmosphere of instability for newcomers to the state. Thequickness in which California transformed from being newlyceded and sparsely populated land from Mexico to a state withan ever-increasing population meant that California'srudimentary legislature had no time to form a contingency plantailored to the needs of its populace. The unique social settingsin gold country, with the lack of the nuclear family and instead,the prevalence of homosocial camps with men of differentethnicities, threatened the fragile morality of the new state.California doctors and legislative representativesinstitutionalized social outcasts prone to drunkenness ordissipation, or because of religious fervor or unemployment,with the intent to reform them. Infant Motor Development Influencing Visual Preference Rebecca Beaton Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology Infants are incredibly adept learners, possessing the ability togather pertinent environmental information about the world andhow it works. This study investigates the relationship betweenan infant's access to information, in the form of motordevelopment, and their visual attention to objects with complexfeatures. Research has shown a robust link between infantexperience manipulating objects and their visual attention toobject properties. In the present study, 4-12-month-old infants(N = 100) were shown pairs of unfamiliar objects. One objectwas easily \"graspable\", with a handle-like region, specialized forgrasping, while the other was not. Additionally, parentscompleted a motor development questionnaire about theirinfant's motor abilities. All data were collected through theLookit online platform and coded with Datavyu software for theduration of looking at both objects. We hypothesize thatincreasingly complex motor capabilities, such as crawling orwalking will influence the features of objects that infants findmost interesting. Thus, an infant with motor ability that allows forobject obtainment and manipulation will show a visualpreference for objects with specialized features, such ashandles.Assessing the Development of Visual Short-Term Memory in the Preschool Period Using an Online Change- Detection Task Caroline Beel Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is the ability to briefly storeand maintain visual representations during disruptions ininformation that occur during eye movements and blinks. Thecurrent study examines VSTM during the preschool periodusing a change detection task on an online testing platform(Gorilla.sc). In change detection, participants are presented witha sample array containing several different colored squares, followed by a delayed period (during which they have to remember the sample items), and finally a test array containingthe previously presented items and one or more changed items.Infants demonstrate their VSTM for the items in the sample arrayby looking longer at the changed items to the non-changeditems in the test arrays (Oakes et al., 2013). We adapted thistask and tested fifty 12- to 48-month-old children. Ongoinganalyses will provide insight into (1) how VSTM develops frominfancy through early childhood and (2) whether we can detectVSTM in children using an online platform. Developing a Model for Community-Driven Single-Use Plastic Reduction in Local Restaurants Alessandra Beelen Sponsor: Andrea Schreier, Ph.D. Animal Science The presence of plastic waste in the oceans poses a majorthreat to marine ecosystems. Numerous marine organismsbecome entangled in or unintentionally ingest plastic debris,and yet, much of the population is unaware of theconsequences of single-use plastics. This project aims toinvestigate single-use plastic consumption in local restaurants inDavis in order to develop a collaborative model that can beadapted to support and encourage restaurants to transitionaway from single-use plastics in Davis and other cities. Thiscollaborative model would allow project stakeholders to usesocial capital to incentivize the reduction of single-use plastic inrestaurants through community promotion. We will conductresearch regarding conventional material costs, costs ofalternatives, how current businesses incorporate compostableproducts, and consumer preference for sustainable materials.By investigating the cost and process of transitioning fromconventional to compostable materials, we can determine thefeasibility of convincing local businesses to employ this modelthroughout the city.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 17Anthropophagy and Sexuality in Hawaiian Religion and British Protestantism Nishchala Beeram Sponsor: Naomi Janowitz, Ph.D. Religious Studies When the British sailors arrived in Hawaii, they were very concerned with and fascinated by the native Hawaiians'practices relating to sexuality and anthropophagy. The Britishcreated many accounts alleging the Hawaiian women were veryeager to have sex with the sailors as well as that the Hawaiianstook delight in consuming human flesh. However, theseaccounts are culturally skewed. They do not answer thequestion: what, if any, was the role of sexuality andanthropophagy in Hawaiian religion? I will argue that many ofthe Hawaiians' practices relating to anthropophagy and sexualitywere religious rituals with the purpose of connecting with thedivine, rather than mere hedonistic indulgences as the Britishthought. I will also examine the British sailors' own practicesrelating to anthropophagy and sexuality in their religion. I willthen compare the differences in the role of sexuality andanthropophagy in Hawaiian religion and British Protestantbeliefs. Experimental reproduction of bone tools - an attempt to quantify relative complexity of bone projectile points from Middle/Late Stone Age Africa Sean Begg Sponsor: Teresa Steele, Ph.D. Anthropology During the transition between the Middle and Late Stone Ages(30,000-60,000 years ago) in Africa, archaeologists have longrecognized a sudden explosion in technological diversity. Thebehaviors these technologies represent have conventionallybeen regarded as increasingly more complex. The addition ofbone technology is considered one of these complextechnologies, but how complex is it really? Here I investigatethe level of investment needed for different methods of bonepoint production to understand when a forager might chooseone over another. I describe the current state of researchregarding this technology. I present results of early experimentalattempts to produce bone points. I am producing both formaland informal bone projectile points to better understand thelevel of complexity of this technology. I have simulated theprocess by which ancient people processed bones for marrow.Next, I will attempt to create projectile points from any suitableblanks in the resulting detritus. After creating different pointsusing a more formal method, the efficiency of the two methodswill be compared in terms of the length of time processing takesand the number of blanks produced with each method to gaininsight into the technological decision making of ancienthumans.Lattice-Boltzmann Simulations of Mass Density Fluid Flow Through a Porous Medium Miranda Bell Sponsor: Jeremy Mason, Ph.D. Materials Science&engineering Fluid flow through a porous medium is a complex phenomenonthat is relevant to multiple engineering areas, but for which fewanalytical solutions are available. The field of computationalfluid dynamics is concerned with finding the numerical solutionsfor these fluid flows. One well-established method to modelcomplex fluid flow is the Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM). Anefficient algorithm for modeling single-phase and multiphasefluid flow with complicated boundary conditions. The results ofthe LBM simulations will be presented for mass density flowthrough two- and three-dimensional porous samples forincompressible fluids with variable viscosities, densities, andvelocities using the Bhatnager-Gross-Krook (BGK)approximation. More specifically, the LBM will be tested forchannel flow of incompressible fluids and particle accumulation.Assuming symmetrical boundary conditions for the upper andlower boundary walls, different porosities will be considered forthe channel. As such, the simulations will reproduce the resultscontained within the literature to identify the impact of thestructure on fluid movement. Septins Regulate the Bellamkonda Sponsor: Kenneth & Cellular Bio The process of autophagy targets organelles and proteins fordegradation in the vacuole/lysosome and is a critical pathwaythat ensures cell survival after cell stress, or perturbations inhomeostasis such as nutrient deprivation or protein autophagy pathways must be balancedwith their down-regulation to ensure cells return to homeostasisand maintain viability, however it is not well understood howthis pathway is constrained. Upon nutrient deprivation,autophagy membranes form around cargo at an assembly sitewhere Atg9-vesicles are trafficked from exits sites in the corticalendoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recent work in the Kaplan labimplicates septin filaments that form near cortical ER exit sites inlimiting the formation of autophagy membranes. We hypothesizethat septins do this by constraining the free diffusion of Atg9-vesicles at the cortical ER. We will use Atg9-3XGFP to collecthigh time resolution images in living wild type and septin mutantcells. Displacement of Atg9 vesicles will be measured using aframe-by-frame comparison algorithm. However, the algorithmrelies on the accuracy of ImageJ to pinpoint foci. Therefore highnoise in frames caused error in the algorithm's ability torecognize Atg9-vesicles. By developing a machine learningprocess, Atg9-foci can be recognized with higher accuracy. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 18Exploring the Bioclimatic Distribution of a Worldwide Plant Pathogen Daniel Kliebenstein, Ph.D. Plant Sciences cinerea is a pathogenic fungus that forms a grayish mold that infects a wide range of plants. It creates a devastatingfinancial loss for vegetable, fruit, and ornamental plant growers.Botrytis thrives in cool and wet spring and summer weather,usually around 15-25\u00b0C. Although Botrytis is a widespread plantpathogen, its genetic diversity and bioclimatic distributions arenot well documented at a large scale. To address thosedistributions, the lab created a database of more than 9000strains. The database is a combination of a meta-analysis ofstrains of 48 studies describing strains of Botrytis from differentregions of the world, and the global weather and climate datafrom the WorldClim dataset. The variables include the hostspecies and extreme or limiting environmental factors,specifically the temperature of the coldest and warmest month,and precipitation of the wet and dry quarters. Such meta-analysis dataset provides an avenue to explore questions on thesusceptible hosts, the critical times and climatic conditions forBotrytis infection using data analysis and statistical tools such asR. CDK1 Enhances Mitochondrial Bioenergetics for Radiation-Induced M.D.,Ph.D. MED: Radiation-oncology It is well-known that radiation induces cell death due to nuclearDNA damage. To survive, cells need to maintain their genomicstability via rapid DNA repair processes; lack of or insufficientrepair mechanisms leads to apoptosis or abnormal cellproliferation and cancer risk. DNA repair is a well-definedenergy consuming process, however the fueling mechanism andcontribution of mitochondrial energy production remainsunclear. Here, we report that radiation enhances mitochondrialATP generation and mitochondrial relocation of cell cycle kinaseCDK1, which is linked with the nuclear DNA repair capacity.Enhanced mitochondrial ATP generation is reversed in cellsharboring CDK1 phosphorylation deficient mutant complex Isubunits. Mitochondrial ATP generation and nuclear DNA repairare also severely compromised in cells harboring mitochondrial-targeted kinase deficient CDK1. These results demonstrate aunique mechanism governing the communication betweenmitochondria and nucleus, in which mitochondria-relocatedCDK1 boosts bioenergetics to meet the increased cellular fueldemand for DNA repair and cell survival under genotoxic stress.Measuring the Mitochondrial Metabolism and DNA Damages in Mammalian Cells Jonathan Berg Sponsor: Jian-jian Li, M.D.,Ph.D. MED: Radiation-oncology Nuclear DNA repair capacity is a critical determinant of cell fateunder genotoxic stress conditions including ionizing radiationand anti-cancer chemotherapy. DNA repair is a well-definedenergy consuming process; however, it is unclear how DNArepair is fueled and whether mitochondrial energy productioncontributes to nuclear DNA repair. We have shown that radiationenhances mitochondrial ATP generation and mitochondrialrelocation of cell cycle kinase CDK1, which is linked with thenuclear DNA repair capacity. The enhanced mitochondrial ATPgeneration is reversed in cells harboring CDK1 phosphorylationdeficient mutant complex I subunits. Mitochondrial ATPgeneration and nuclear DNA repair are also severelycompromised in cells harboring mitochondrial-targeted kinasedeficient CDK1. In addition, we recently found that cells withcircadian gene deficiency are more sensitive to radiation thancells with the circadian gene functional. We are currentlystudying the DNA repair capacity by measuring DNA repairenzyme activity and DNA damage foci formation followingradiation. Together, our results indicate that mitochondrialenergy metabolism and nuclear DNA repair are in activecommunication to enhance cellular homeostasis that is requiredto defend against genotoxic stress conditions. Furtherelucidation of the mitochondrial-nuclear pathway will help todefine therapeutic targets in cancer radiotherapy. Examining the Effects of Handedness on Finger Control and Stability Guneet Bindra Sponsor: Wilsaan Joiner, Ph.D. or left-hand dominance) has beenshown to influence motor performance and limb coordination. Inthis preliminary study we created a setup and implemented acommon motor learning manipulation (a gain perturbation) toexamine how handedness affects finger movement adjustments.In the setup, a finger-tracking device (Leap Motion, Inc.)monitored index finger position, which was translated to screencursor movement. The task requires subjects to produce a grip(e.g., a fist) in order to move the cursor to a target. After aninitial baseline phase, we increase the gain of the cursormovement by 20%; the cursor travels 20% further for the samefinger movement during baseline. We expect that subjects willlearn to modify their grip pattern to compensate for the visualfeedback disturbance. Throughout testing, subjects willcomplete trials with four target/finger movement levels (e.g.,25%, 50%, 75% and 100% movement). After testing the dominanthand, subjects will perform the same task on their non-dominanthand. We expect that right-handed subjects will demonstrate afaster learning rate with their dominant hand in response to theperturbation. The long-term goal is to use this task to assesshandedness and dominance-based differences in dexterousfinger control.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 19Understanding Institutional Culture as a Limit to Addressing Sexual Harassment: A Case Study of One Bay Area High School Sarah Bjerkholt Sponsor: Robert Faris, Ph.D. Sociology The purpose of this thesis is to investigate institutional and cultural barriers to preventing and addressing sexualharassment in high schools. This research relies on a case studyof one California high school. Research will be collectedthrough qualitative interviews with former students, staff, andschool administrators. In addition, data will also be gleaned fromthe examination of public data such as school board meetingrecords and school policies dating from 2013 to present.Preliminary research suggests that there are a multitude ofstructural and cultural impediments to effectively addressingrape culture and sexual harrasment among peers and from staffto students within high schools. I explore whether sex positivesexual health messaging can be misconstrued, creatingadditional pressure on targets of harassment. This researchaims to highlight issues preventing the cultural shift needed toaddress school based sexual harassment and spotlight areas forpolicy and institutional changes. Investigating the Regulation of Chromosomal Crossing Over in Brca2 Deficient Spermatocytes Devon Blount Sponsor: Neil Hunter, Ph.D. Microbiology & Molec Genetics Meiosis is a fundamental process in sexually reproducingorganisms that leads to the formation of haploid gametes (eggsand sperms) from diploid germ cells. The reduction inchromosome number is mediated by homologousrecombination, which leads to chromosome pairing andcrossing over. Crossover formation is tightly controlled event aserrors in this process can lead to chromosome missegregationresulting in infertility, pregnancy miscarriage, and congenitaldisorders. Breast Cancer Associated factor, BRCA2 plays anessential role in regulating homologous recombination byrecruiting the DNA pairing and strand-exchange protein RAD51to sites of DNA breaks. However, the role of BRCA2 inregulating homologous recombination during meiosis is not wellunderstood. To investigate the role of BRCA2 during meiosis,our lab used a conditional mutant allele of the essential Brca2gene that is inactivated using a meiosis specific Crerecombinase. Our preliminary analysis of spermatocytechromosome spreads from age-matched mutant and controlmice suggests that, besides its expected function in early stepsof meiotic recombination, BRCA2 also promotes a normaldistribution of crossovers; specifically at least one crossover perchromosome (called crossover assurance) and adjacentcrossovers that are widely spaced (crossover interference). I aminvestigating how BRCA2 might contribute to these crossovercontrol processes.A Review of PFAS Effects on Animal Models: Reproductive and Developmental Health Impacts Janae Bonnell Sponsor: Michele La Merrill, Ph.D. Environmental Toxicology Per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) chemicals are used in theproduction of many consumer goods and various industrialprocesses, and they have been widely detected in samples fromboth humans and animals. PFOS and PFOA have beencomprehensively studied and are being phased out of use, butthere are many other understudied PFAS chemicals withpotential adverse effects that should be considered inregulatory affairs regarding public health and safety. In thisstudy, we focus on how the reproductive health anddevelopment of animal models is affected by exposure to literaturereview presents the observed reproductive and developmentaleffects of these chemicals on animal models, which can be usedto help establish legislative priorities and draw attention tocurrent gaps in published research. Neural Selectivity in the Temporal Domain of the Auditory a type of age-related hearing deficit that beginsaround middle age and affects more than 50% of individuals 70and older. It is characterized by a gradual decline in hearingcapabilities as age increases and is particularly present inacoustically challenging environments or when involvingcomplex signals. My project is focused on the hypothesis thatthis deficit is caused by neural activity in the rostral regions ofauditory cortex being differentially by aging and compared to caudal auditory cortical regions. To test thishypothesis, analyzed neuronal regions R (rostral) andA1 cortex. My preliminary findings showhigher neural selectivity in area R, lower firing rate in non-reorganized regions of R than A1, as well as no significantdifference between spatially and temporally modulated sounds.My next step is to analyze areas R and A1 for spatial sensitivity,as well as analyze other areas of the auditory cortex in whichdata has been previously collected. Significant findings in theseexperiments would illuminate the largely uninvestigated areas ofcore regions processing in the auditory cortex and allow foradvancements in speech processing and comprehension inthose with presbycusis.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 20A Statistical Physics Description of Glacier Calving Behavior in Ice-Shelf Evolution Paige Brady Sponsor: John Rundle, Ph.D. Physics Ice-shelves are free-floating platforms of ice that provide buttressing forces to land-based glaciers. The collapse of anice-shelf due to calving may cause additional ice to enter theocean and contribute to global sea-level rise, motivating a needfor estimates of the likelihood of this type of event. However,significant challenges persist in incorporating the dynamics ofcalving glaciers into large-scale ice-sheet simulations. In thisstudy, we introduce passive tracers with fiber bundles ofrandom strengths to a one-dimensional shallow-shelf in orderto simulate the strains and stresses which lead to discretefracturing and calving. These tracers advect along with the ice-shelf until the fiber bundles reach a critical elongation based onrandomly distributed strengths. The bundle then breaks,initiating a calving event in the shelf. We will discuss preliminaryresults from this model that reproduce the style of calving at theErebus ice-tongue in Antarctica, including quantifying theaverage calving events for Erebus over a 100 yeartime-scale. We propose that this model will be successful inestimating average long-term ice-shelf calving events, as well asdetermining whether there is a condition under which normalcalving behavior becomes a catastrophic collapse. Into My Mother's Womb Grace-Lynn Bridges Sponsor: Cristiana Giordano, Ph.D. Anthropology Slavery was the first attack on the Black family unit, making itnearly impossible for family formation, let alone stability andsecurity within these bonds. During slavery, Black mothers wererenowned for trying to protect their children, and keep thefamily together. Nearly 200 years later violence against theBlack community persists. Many of these evils acts have beenjustified in systematic ways: The Black Codes, Jim Crow, massincarceration and police violence. Karl Marx argued thatcapitalism seeps down even into the family unit, and so I ask:does not structural violence do the same? Throughethnographic interviews with Black mothers and archivalresearch, my hope is to bear witness to the voices that havebeen drowned out and turned into statistics. I am interested inexploring how violence enters the home shaping subjectivitiesand relationships, psychic experiences and bodily presences. For centuries, Black families have had to navigate an extremelyviolent America. This research project posits to understand justhow parents teach or do not teach their children to circumventsocietal strain and trauma. As a society we've separated theprivate from the public, I aim to express just how interconnectedthe domestic and the social really are. Gender Differences in Class Participation in Core Computer Science Classes Madison Brigham Sponsor: Joel Porquet, Ph.D. Engr Computer Science In terms of students enrolled, UCD computer science (CS)classes are typically male dominated, which can create abaseline perception of male dominance in class participation.We analyzed participation scores received by male and femalestudents in two core computer science classes across tenquarters to explore the question: Is there a difference in maleand female participation scores, and does thisdisproportionately impact male and female students' finalgrades? We find a small gender gap in overall participationscores, but no significant difference between the rate at whichmale and female students' grades benefit from participationpoints. However, we do see a difference in behavior in differentformats of participation: males score higher on average in morepublic formats, such as lecture and forum, while females scorehigher in more anonymous formats, such as survey completion.Therefore, instructors should diversify their definitions ofparticipation to accommodate for gender correlated preferencesin participation formats. Furthermore, we find that the topscorers in the most public forms of participation aredisproportionately male. This explains the perception of a largergender gap in participation than actually exists, which canenforce the stereotype that males have a greater aptitude forCS than females. Synthesis and Duplex Stability of N2-Alkyl 8-Oxo-2'- deoxyguanosine Oligonucleotides for use as Substrate Analogs for Repair Protein MutY Madeline Bright Sponsor: Sheila David, Ph.D. Chemistry Reactive oxygen species cause oxidative damage tonucleobases in DNA which results in 8-Oxoguanine upon DNAreplication, a of which is destructive to the cell. repair (BER) cleavage results in an abasic site across from 8-OG, which is repaired by downstream BER enzymes. Inheritedvariants of MUTYH, the human homolog, have been linked tothe initiation and development of carcinogenesis. How MutY isable to differentiate the mispaired adenine from correct T:Apairs is the focus of my research in Sheila David's lab. This workwill determine the effect of steric bulk and hydrogen bondingimparted by the 2-amino of 8-OG on the target recognitionmechanism of MutY via 8-Oxo-2'-dG analogs modified at the 2-position. It will also analyze the duplex stability of producedoligonucleotides. Synthetic analogs will help reveal the structuralfeatures dominant in MutY's target recognition of the 8-OG:Amispair when subjected to binding, kinetics, and cellular repairassays.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 21Changes in Early Post-Operative Toe-Brachial Indices May Reflect Positive or Negative Remodeling Christina Brown Sponsor: Mimmie Kwong, M.D. MED: Surgery Current guidelines recommend utilization of ankle brachial index (ABI) for surveillance after infrainguinal revascularization. Littleguidance exists regarding the ideal timing of this. To study this,we performed a retrospective review of infrainguinalprocedures between July 2014 and November 2019 at anacademic center. Patient information, procedural details, andpre- and post-operative ABI and toe-arm indices (TAI) werecollected. 711 patients underwent infrainguinal revascularizationfor peripheral arterial disease. 404 patients had a valid post-procedural ABI or TAI. Locally-weighted regression of the TAIdemonstrated early improvement with a steep rise in TAI withinthe first two days, followed by continued improvement until aplateau at 20 days. 36 patients underwent two studies within 30days of their procedure. Of these, five (13.9%) had a significant(>0.15) decrease in their TAI, 19 (52.8%) had no change, and 12(33.3%) had increased TAI. 40% of those with decreased TAIrequired reintervention within 1 year compared with 30% ofthose whose TAI increased or remained unchanged. Our studydemonstrated post-procedural TAI plateaus after 20 days,suggesting that immediate baseline studies may not accuratelyreflect the peak interventional benefit. However, when serialstudies are performed, decreased TAI may help identify patientswho require reintervention. \"It's my normal\": A Linguistic Analysis of In and Outgroup Perceptions of PTSD in Young Adults Hannah Brown Sponsor: Vaidehi Ramanathan-Abbott, Ph.D. Linguistics Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs due to undergoinga traumatic event or multiple events over time. The invisiblenature of PTSD makes it very hard to know someone has itwithout the use of language, lending it well to linguisticsresearch. Building on previous work (Hoyt 2020) exploringlinguistic markers of PTSD and the role of repetition andrecontextualization in recovery (Ramanathan, 2015; Thompson,2016), this research performs an initial comparison of in andoutgroup perceptions of PTSD and the recovery processthrough a pilot study involving six young adults. Of particularinterest are each group's definitions of PTSD and recovery andthe presence of implicit linguistic markers of group membership.To explore this, the participants' interviews are analyzed withattention to emergent themes and word choice. First, I find amismatch between in and outgroup perceptions of thechallenges associated with PTSD; outgroup members focusedmore on others' perceptions and ingroup members more oninternal loss of agency. I also find a significant difference in howmembers of each group use words related to normalcy, pointingto the conclusion that\u2014for participants in this initial study\u2014recontextualizing the meaning of \"normal\" may play a role inPTSD recovery.Using Neural Networks to Study SARS-CoV-2 Mutations Caitlin Brown Sponsor: Francisco Arsuaga, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio Infection of individuals by SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible forthe disease COVID-19, varies greatly in its manifestation. Whilemany individuals remain asymptomatic, some develop severerespiratory symptoms and much of this mechanism is stillunknown. Evidence suggests part of the answer may lie in theviral structure itself. A region of particular interest is the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein which bindsto the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) andultimately leads to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Understandingthe dynamics of this protein docking will help predict potentialmutations of the novel coronavirus and may illuminate geneticfactors influencing the symptomatic heterogeneity. In this paper,I curate a dataset of RBD genomes with both observed andartificially generated variants, render them in a three-dimensional space that accounts for the atoms' biophysicalproperties (voxelization), and use them to train and test abackpropagation neural network. The network will predict thebinding affinity resulting from different mutations to the RBD.Ultimately, these results pave the way for identifying deadlytheoretical mutations to SARS-CoV-2 before they emerge bynatural evolution, and allow public health officials to prepareaccordingly. Quantifying Changes in Gene Regulation Across Cell Types Ryan Buchner Sponsor: Gerald Quon, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio As organisms develop, cells differentiate and specialize,allowing for the existence of complex tissues. While the DNAsequence of each cell does not typically change over thecourse of development, the regulatory network governing howgenes are expressed changes over time. These changes ingene expression are responsible for the uniqueness of thedifferent cell types in an organism. Understanding how theunderlying gene regulatory network changes with developmentin both healthy and disease afflicted individuals is a central goalof molecular biology. However, there does not currently existany useful statistical measurement for quantifying how far aparttwo populations of cells are with respect to transcriptionalregulation. My work involves the development of machinelearning-based models of gene regulation that facilitateestimation of transcriptional divergence of multiple cell typessimultaneously. On simulated single cell transcriptional data, mymodel has shown the ability to accurately determine theseparation between cell populations.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 22A Glance into Light-sensing Mechanisms: Light-induced Destruction Ryan Buchner Sponsor: Nitzan Shabek, Ph.D. Plant Biology A fundamental requirement for the evolution of life on earth is the capacity to recognize light; this ability is not just paramountto the survival of animals, but also for plants as they require lightas an energy source. Plants use their ability to sense light toswitch between different modes of growth, growing elongatedstems and a lesser number of chloroplasts when in the absenceof light. This ability allows germinated seedlings to focus theirenergy stores on the task of reaching the surface to find light.The molecular mechanisms behind this transition have not yetbeen fully deciphered; in my research, I look to betterunderstand this process by attempting to discover the structureof two of the proteins involved in this process, PIF3 and EBF1.This knowledge would allow us to fill in gaps in scientificknowledge and also possibly allow for the creation of newbiotechnological tools. Part Preparation and Cable Routing within a CubeSat Napsia Buddhamatya Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & REALOP is the first UC Davis undergraduate-based CubeSatteam with a launch scheduled for late 2021. Under missionREALOP, the Structures team has developed a cable harnessingmodel and prepared a process for manufacturing. Morespecifically, the parts preparation subteam is responsible formanufacturing preparation as well as creating validation andverification documents. The cable harnessing subteam isresponsible for acquiring cable lengths and organization for usein electrical wiring. For parts preparation, drawings of everycomponent as well as tolerances were made for use inmanufacturing. Then Interface and Control Documents (ICDs)were developed to detail how each component interfaces withone another during assembly. Mechanical Part InspectionDocuments (MPINs) were also created to verify if themanufacturers made the components correctly. For the cableharnessing subteam, Solidworks was used to provide areasonable representation of the wiring in the CubeSat in orderto obtain wire lengths. Drawings of the wire lengths were thengenerated for use by the electrical team. Both teams in tandemprovide a basic schematic of how the CubeSat is assembled,but more importantly also expose members to thedocumentation and practices that go into spacecraftdevelopment, increasing the efficiency of developing futureCubeSats.Global Composition of Bacteriophage Community in Honeybees Taylor Busby Sponsor: Joanne Emerson, Ph.D. Plant Pathology Honeybees are a vital component of natural and agriculturalsystems around the world. With continuous exposure topollution, pathogens, and parasites, it is necessary to find a wayto preserve these colonies without negatively affecting theirwild counterparts. This study evaluates the viral communitypresent in honeybees to provide a backbone for future work onthe microbiome's potential as a mode of colony control andprotection. We utilized both Illumina and PacBio sequencing onviral isolates from a Texan honeybee gut. We have identifiedmany bacteriophages and are analyzing their genomes. Theresults are currently being compared with two other studies thatperformed a similar analysis on honeybee colonies in Belgiumand Switzerland. Because those groups did not utilize PacBiothis will also allow an analysis of the efficacy of PacBiotechnology and how it may benefit other metagenomicsequencing projects. This research project is ongoing, and weare discovering that the bacteriophages are related to therelatively simple bacterial composition of the gut microbiome.The information that has been collected on their lifestyles, hostranges, and metabolic potential suggests that these phages areideal for further evaluation for their potential to coordinatehoneybee biochemistry and potentially act as tools ofprotection.

Magnetic elements are rare,and the best way to predict novel magnetic materials is toconstrain a search to analyzing the magnetic properties ofcompounds containing iron, cobalt, and manganese. However,while many databases exist for the purposes of analyzingstructural properties of compounds, any such database ofmagnetic materials that exists is either outdated or incomplete.This study aims to systematically gather the magnetic propertiesof 13,796 compounds containing the element cobalt, and as ofnow, a total of 1,341 ferromagnetic compounds have been foundand catalogued. These data were collected with the structuredata and atomic content of each compound, and trends wereanalyzed to predict novel ferromagnetic and anisotropiccompounds. From this, previously unstudied members of theCu2MnAl, and La6Co11Ga3 structure types were confirmed tobe ferromagnetic with Curie temperatures at or above roomtemperature, with others still being studied to check forferromagnetism and uniaxial anisotropy. The research wassupported by the Critical Materials Institute, an EnergyInnovation Hub funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Officeof Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, AdvancedManufacturing Office. Co-occurrence Statistics From Vision and Language Capture Thematic Relationships Between Objects Ruilin Cai Sponsor: Joy Geng, Ph.D. Psychology Thematic relationships have been defined as the grouping ofobjects together by virtue of their complementary roles in thesame scenario or event. We examined the extent to which anunsupervised machine-learning algorithm trained on object co-occurrence statistics could capture thematic relationshipsbetween objects within events. We asked Mturk workers(n=240) to list the most common objects found in 24 events. Wethen trained several models with a continuous-bag-of-word(CBOW) architecture, but with different training corpora. Theprimary question of interest was whether human ratings forobjects belonging to common themes were better described bytraining on visual scenes or text description. Vision-basedmodels were trained on a database of over 22k denselysegmented real-world and photorealistic scenes. Language-based models were trained on a database of over 2.6 billionwebsites, wikipedia pages, and news articles. We found thatobject rankings provided by language based models were morestrongly correlated with human rankings of objects than therankings provided by image-based models. Together thesefindings reveal the need to reexamine the way in which wedefine thematic relationships, and point towards the importanceof understanding the impact of both visual and textual inputs.The Influence of Classroom Language Environment on Bilingual Language Proficiency: Mexican-American and Chinese-American Dual Language Learners in Head Start Xiaoyu Cai Sponsor: Yuuko Tonkovich, Ed.D. Education Research shows that classroom language has a role inchildren's language development with both monolingual anddual language learners (DLLs), particularly for children from low-socio-economic homes. The limited past studies that examineclassroom language have focused on Spanish-English DLLs.However, DLLs are a heterogeneous group and more researchneeds to be done with DLLs from other language backgrounds.This study examines (a) the difference between Mexican-American (MA) and Chinese-American (CA), (b) the effect of leadteacher verbal communication on DLLs' language skills, and (c)correlation between the frequency of English language andheritage language (HL) use by lead teachers and DLLs.Classroom language environment was assessed using theLanguage Interaction Snapshot (LISn) that captures languageinteractions of a total of 12 MA and 13 CA preschoolers in HeadStart settings. Each participant was observed for 5 snapshots fora total of 25 minutes between spring and summer 2019. Eachchild's oral proficiency was assessed using the Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Oral Language. Preliminary results showthat teachers with CA DLLs spoke in HL more than teacherswith MA DLLs. CA DLLs also talked to their teachers in HL morefrequently than MA DLLs. Implications for educators will bediscussed. Sclerotinia Minor in Ornamental Sponsor: Cassandra foxglove and scabiosa were sent tothe Field and Vegetable Pathology Diagnostics lab at UC Davisfrom San Luis Obispo County. The plants exhibited browndiscoloration, soft rot of the crown and lower stem, presence ofwhite mycelium and black sclerotia. Sclerotinia minor was isolated from infected plants. S. minor is a soilborne pathogenwhich colonizes host root and stem resulting in degradation ofthe crown and vascular tissue. Once present in a field it can bedifficult to manage. This pathogen has not been reported inthese ornamental crops in California. To confirm thepathogenicity of the isolates recovered, foxglove and scabiosaplants were inoculated with two different S. minor isolates recovered from the samples sent in 2019. Symptomdevelopment in inoculated plants appear consistent with theplants where S. minor was originally recovered from. Tocomplete Koch's postulates, pathogen isolations fromsymptomatic plants are underway. By confirming the presenceof S. minor, we can classify it as a new pathogen in ornamentalflowers in California. Information learned will be useful forgrowers, farm advisors, and diagnosticians to expand theirsearch range when monitoring for disease.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 24Identifying Strengths and Barriers Faced by Latinx Parents of Children With Special Needs Cristavel Camacho-Gutierrez Sponsor: Yvette Flores, Ph.D. Chicano Studies Latinx immigrant parents may arrive in the United States with an optimistic attitude toward the challenges that await them, buttoo often they lack the necessary skills to access resources andservices that may support their children's academic success.Having a child with special needs further complicates thisprocess. Moreover, the ongoing Covid-19 health crisis hasexacerbated these preexisting challenges and createdadditional barriers for parents to navigate. My research aims todetect and explore the barriers that Latinx families with childrenwith special needs encounter, while also recognizing the familialcultural resources that they may have. I will conduct a qualitativestudy through telehealth, which will consist of semi-structuredinterviews to be carried out with Latinx parents of children withspecial needs. My research will illuminate some of the currentchallenges faced by this particular group of parents whileidentifying their resiliency and desire to organize. My findingswill shed light on areas of further research and may have policyimplications to reduce barriers for immigrant parents. Motion Categorization in Children With Upper Limb Differences Nicole Campbell Sponsor: Wilsaan Joiner, Ph.D. MED: Neurology Despite the numerous commercially available adult prostheticdevices, current options for children with upper limb differenceshave largely failed to show significant quality of lifeimprovements. Myoelectric devices, which use some of the mostreliable advanced designs, are abandoned by children twice asfrequently as adults. Thus, developing novel control schemesthat are reliable, robust, and easy to learn is critical for the nextgeneration of pediatric prostheses. Sonomyography (i.e., the useof ultrasound imaging to detect muscle deformations) pairedwith machine learning classification algorithms has been shownto be a promising candidate for adult prosthetic control. Here,we developed a testbed for this control in pediatric patients byintegrating a classification algorithm (K-Nearest-Neighbor, KNN)with a custom, 3D printed, low-cost powered prosthetic hand.The long-term goal is to use this setup to assess the motorcontrol abilities in patients being treated at Shriners Hospital forChildren; examining how early development affects control andis gradually refined in patients with congenital upper limbdifferences.Constructs of SynDIG1 for experiments in (LTP), a specific processof synaptic plasticity, is characterized synapticAMPA receptors (AMPARs) through targeting of non-synapticreserve AMPAR pools. The type II transmembrane proteinSynapse Differentiation Induced Gene 1 (SynDIG1) was identifiedto interact and cluster with AMPARs by usage of an N-terminallyHA-tagged construct. To study this protein, we made aconstruct containing an untagged version of SynDIG1. Thisconstruct confirmed of SynDIG1 in the plasmid and its expression inmammalian cells. We are also constructing two plasmidscontaining SynDIG1 C-terminally tagged with differentfluorescent proteins (SEP or pHuji). These proteins wereselected for their similar pH dependence and ability to beimaged simultaneously in living cells. These constructs will beused in future experiments to assess the function of SynDIG1 inAMPAR trafficking during LTP. The untagged construct will beuseful in experiments with temperature-dependent regulation ofendocytosis while the fusion constructs in live-imaging ofSynDIG1 and SEP-GluA1 or SynDIG4-pHuji. By exploring thesemechanisms, we hope to gain insight into the complexities oflearning and memory. 2020 U.S. Twitter Analysis: A Knowledge Extraction of Events and Public Influence Trevor Carpenter Sponsor: Setareh Rafatirad, Ph.D. Engr Computer Science In the age of social media, Twitter is a medium for the everydayperson to not only voice their opinion on large topics, but alsoconnect with and influence thousands as a result. In 2020, ayear of elections, lockdowns, and vast differences of opinion in the United States, Twitter was ranked 4 th in the world in engagement, as social media played a large role in influencing historic events. In this research we utilize Machine Learning andData Science techniques to analyze tweets throughout the yearand visualize their correlation with large events and publicreception. The project emphasizes the use of algorithms for thepurpose of finding what influences people; whether that isclassifying harmful bots that spread misinformation or analyzingtext sentiment to quantify the attitude of users. The research iscurrently in progress, but preliminary results suggest a strongpolarization of opinions throughout the year, as well as anincrease in misinformation spreading twitter bots. Our goal is touse this research to warn about the harmful influence of socialmedia in polarizing people's opinions on political topics.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 25Is it Gato or Gatito? Diminutives in Sponsor: Katharine Graf Estes, Ph.D. Psychology Caregivers play a crucial role in infants' language experience. Infant-directed speech (IDS) includes features like slow speechrate, higher pitch, and word repetition than adult-directedspeech (ADS). It's believed that this speech register facilitateslanguage learning. However these features are frommonolingual studies. We know very little about bilingual IDS.The IDS literature suggests that diminutive words (i.e., kitty) isanother feature frequently used by parents talking to theirinfants. Diminutives may facilitate lexical learning because theyregulate the prosodic shape of words, helping infants segmentand learn words in their languages. The purpose of this study isto explore diminutives with Spanish-English bilingual parentsand English-speaking parents. Eight-to-20-month-olds and theirparents (N = 40) participated in a set of interactive taskscontaining objects labelled with target words in English (formonolinguals) or English and Spanish (for bilinguals). Fromcoded transcripts of the sessions, we will analyze the frequencyof diminutives use by parents. We predict bilingual parents willuse more diminutives than monolingual parents because it iscommon in Spanish for IDS nouns to be diminutivized. We willtest whether bilingual parents produce more diminutives inEnglish than monolingual English-speaking parents, suggestingan influence of the bilinguals' Spanish knowledge. Investigating the Effects of Advanced Diabetes and Aging on Pancreatic Alpha Cells Vincent Castillo Sponsor: Mark Huising, Ph.D. MED: Physiology & Membrane Biol Diabetes is a devastating disease for individuals of all ages, butin particular for elderly individuals where mortality rate issignificantly increased by diabetes. A feature of type 2 diabetesis that glucagon, a counterregulatory hormone from islet alphacells, is found in excess at an early stage, and is laterhyposecreted in advanced diabetes. I hypothesize that thecombination of diabetes and aging induce a change in alphacell responsiveness that underlies glucagon dysfunction seenclinically. To test this hypothesis, I will be using a calciumsensor, which is highly correlated with exocytosis, expressed inalpha cells to measure cell activity. Through this I will recordtheir responses to specific physiological cues, such asepinephrine, arginine vasopressin, amino acids and glucose andlook at how responses change with age (young/old) and diseasestate (lean/diabetic). As expected, I observed that aging alonedoesn't affect glucose sensitivity in mice. However, we expectthat the combination of diabetes and aging will induce a changein alpha cell responsiveness. These experiments will contributea better understanding of the fundamental differences in alphacells as a result of age and diabetes with the goal of improvingtreatments and extending longevity in those with diabetes.Investigating the Effects of Advanced Diabetes and Aging on Pancreatic Alpha Cells Vincent Castillo Sponsor: Mark Huising, Ph.D. MED: Physiology & Membrane Biol Diabetes is a devastating disease for individuals of all ages, butin particular for elderly individuals where mortality rate issignificantly increased by diabetes. A feature of type 2 diabetesis that glucagon, a counterregulatory hormone from islet alphacells, is found in excess at an early stage, and is laterhyposecreted in advanced diabetes. I hypothesize that thecombination of diabetes and aging induce a change in alphacell responsiveness that underlies glucagon dysfunction seenclinically. To test this hypothesis, I will be using a calciumsensor, which is highly correlated with exocytosis, expressed inalpha cells to measure cell activity. Through this I will recordtheir responses to specific physiological cues, such asepinephrine, arginine vasopressin, amino acids and glucose andlook at how responses change with age (young/old) and diseasestate (lean/diabetic). As expected, I observed that aging alonedoesn't affect glucose sensitivity in mice. However, we expectthat the combination of diabetes and aging will induce a changein alpha cell responsiveness. These experiments will contributea better understanding of the fundamental differences in alphacells as a result of age and diabetes with the goal of improvingtreatments and extending longevity in those with diabetes. Investigating Processing of Sentences Containing Covert Racialized Adjectives Isaias Ceballos III Sponsor: Maria Ferreira, M.D.,Ph.D. Psychology Have you ever felt uncomfortable hearing President Obamareferred to as \"articulate\"? Racially coded language is notalways obvious. This project investigates how racializedadjectives affect language processing. We will administer asurvey in which we ask subjects to list adjectives that vary inoffensiveness. Following the survey, we will conduct a ratingstudy on a Likert scale where the polar opposites of the scaleare \"not offensive\" or \"extremely offensive\" and we will gatherthe responses in the middle to examine how covert linguisticmicroaggressions affect processing. We also will conduct a self-paced reading study in which participants read sentences word-by-word. We intend to compare sentences with and withoutracialized adjectives and also compare sentences where thereferent matches the intended covert microaggression (e.g.,articulate Barack Obama vs articulate Bill Clinton). For this self-paced study, we predict that sentences with racializedadjectives that also match the intended referent will beprocessed faster because there is a match of stereotypedknowledge between the adjective and who the racializedadjective is referring to. This work is important because it willallow us to identify these more subtle racialized adjectives andto assess their effects on real-time language processing.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 26Ex Vivo Ovary Culture to Characterize Key Meiotic Prophase Events in Mice Charlene Chan Sponsor: Neil Hunter, Ph.D. Microbiology & Molec Genetics Sexual reproduction relies on meiosis, a cell division defined by one round of replication and two rounds of chromosomesegregation that produce haploid gametes. In this study, we aimto establish an ex vivo ovary organ culture as an experimentalmodel system to study key meiotic prophase events duringoogenesis. To do so, we harvested fetal ovaries at E12.5, astage when mitotically dividing germ cells will soon entermeiotic prophase I and cultured them for several days. Tomonitor meiotic progression, we took cultured ovaries andprepared chromosome spreads, then used immunofluorescenceto visualize marker proteins associated with different substagesof prophase I. After we determine that our ex vivo organ cultureis a viable model to study meiosis, we plan to test whether theprotein kinase Cdc7 has a conserved role in mammalianmeiosis to trigger the initiation of recombination via DNAdouble-strand break (DSB) formation. To do this, we will inhibitits activity with a known Cdc7 inhibitor PHA-767491. If Cdc7activity is necessary for DSB formation, we would expect to seediminished numbers of chromosome-associated foci of RAD51and RPA, two proteins that bind the ends of DSBs. Effects of Lactoferrin on Placental Development Sandra Chan Lonnerdal, Ph.D. Lactoferrin (Lf) is an iron-binding found in humansecretory fluids, such as amniotic fluid. Lf is a pleiotropic proteininvolved in various bioactivities, including cell proliferation anddifferentiation. Lf may contribute to placental development sincea high concentration of Lf appears in the human trophoblast.Currently, effects of Lf on placental development remainunclear. Here, we hypothesized that Lf promotes placentaldevelopment. To address this hypothesis, a mouse model and ahuman trophoblast cell model (BeWo cells) were used. Lfexpression in different mouse tissues was first analyzed byisolating RNA from different mouse tissues/organs includingmammary gland, bone marrow, liver, and placenta for qRT-PCRanalysis. The results showed high concentrations of Lftranscripts in the placenta. To determine functions of theabundant Lf in the placenta, BeWo cells were treated with Lf(50-250 /uni03BC.1g/mL) for 72 h and then effects of Lf on placental differentiation were evaluated by qRT-PCR of two trophoblastdifferentiation markers, human chorionic gonadotropin The that Lf up-regulated transcription of these twodifferentiation markers. Put together, Lf is abundantly present inthe placenta during pregnancy and may promote placentaldifferentiation.Increasing Accessibility of Healthy Davis Daily Symptom Tracker to Multilingual Communities Helena Chan Sponsor: Prabhu Shankar, M.D. MED: Public Health Sciences The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has plagued Yolo County andSacramento over the past year. As recommended by the Centerfor Disease Control, an understanding of the symptoms of thedisease is necessary to take control measures and preventspread of the infection. The majority of the mainstreaminformation about COVID-19 symptoms only available in theEnglish language, and families with Limited English Proficiency(LEP) are left at a disadvantage. Creating a multilingual platformcan increase accuracy of symptom capture through thetranslation of healthydavistogether.com COVID-19 symptomtracking and important information about vaccination. Theproject information will be translated into the popular languagesspoken in Yolo County which will be compiled both into a digitallibrary, as well as into a pamphlet in English and other mostcommonly spoken languages. The symptoms will be depictedwith images and checkboxes. The commonly usedrepresentations of the disease manifestations will be mapped tothe currently used English terms, as well as SNOMED-CTvocabulary. If successfully implemented and maintained, thisproject will increase awareness, data accuracy, strengthenresearch, and encourage LEP population participation in COVID-19 public health preventative measures. The model could begeneralizable to any future threats by illnesses to public health. Quantification and Structural Analysis of Cell Glycogen Using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Based Methods Vincent Chang Sponsor: Carlito Lebrilla, Ph.D. Chemistry Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in animals and humansand has important roles in both regulating blood sugar levelsand supplying energy to cells. Because of these key roles, manystudies aim to elucidate the effect of enzymes and hormones onglycogen storage and utilization by extracting and quantifyingglycogen from cells and tissues. Currently, most glycogenassays are based on colorimetric and fluorometric methods,which quantify total carbohydrates instead of glucose fromsamples, and provide little to no structural information onglycogen. Herein, we present a workflow for extractingglycogen from human liver cancer cells (HepG2), quantifyingglycogen by specifically measuring glucose from extractedglycogen, and elucidating structural information of glycogensuch as the degree of branching using ultra-high-performanceliquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole massspectrometry workflow, themonosaccharide and glycosidic linkage composition of the cellglycogen were determined, and four commercial glycogenstandards and amylopectin were also analyzed for structuralcomparison and method validation. Other studies that aim tobetter understand the effect of enzymes and hormones onglycogen metabolism or better diagnose glycogen storagedisorders can apply the methods presented in this study forcomprehensive glycogen analysis.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 27A Structurally Defined Pea Fiber Snack Alters the Human Fecal Metabolome. Jessica Chao Sponsor: Carlito Lebrilla, Ph.D. Chemistry The western diet is characterized by high saturated fat and sucrose consumption and low fiber consumption. It furthercorrelates with an increased rate of morbidity. It is known thatthis diet modifies the gut microbiota and it further impactshuman health through these modifications. Fiber is an importantand necessary component of diet. Despite the importance offiber, relatively little is known regarding the chemical structuresof fiber and how these structures impact human health. Tounravel how dietary fiber affects the gut microbiome and theproduced metabolites, targeted metabolomics were performedon human fecal samples from a well-defined feeding study. Inthis study, 12 participants were placed on a controlled highsaturated fat and low fruit and vegetable (HiSF-LoFV) diet for 6weeks. Participants were then given a pea fiber snack on weeks3 and 4 as a supplement to their controlled diet. Fecal samplesobtained from each week were subjected to derivatization withbenzoyl chloride and 2-picolylamine before a targeted UHPLC-QqQ-MS analysis. This work will further our understanding ofhow defined fiber structures may selectively alter the gutmicrobial metabolome and thus their effect on health. Aedes aegypti Mosquito Behavioral Thermoregulation: Implications for Understanding Viral Transmission Dynamics Claire Chapman Sponsor: Christopher Barker, Ph.D. VM: Pathology, Micro, & Immun Temperature plays an important role in mosquito physiology;like many insects, mosquitoes are ectotherms and mustbehaviorally thermoregulate to avoid temperature extremes andremain at physiologically suitable temperatures. Behavioralthermoregulation also plays an important role in mosquito-borne virus transmission dynamics by altering the extrinsicincubation period, the time from ingestion of the virus totransmission. However, few studies have been conducted onmosquito behavioral thermoregulation outside of host-seekingbehavior. This study will be one of the first to elucidatetemperature preferences of the mosquito Aedes aegypti duringthe critical period from blood feeding through the extrinsicincubation period. We will use a thermal gradient bar with anenclosed Plexiglas arena in a temperature and humiditycontrolled chamber, providing the mosquitoes the option to landon a metal surface ranging from 18\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C. Mosquitoes willbe placed in the arena and pictures are taken remotely atregular intervals. We will analyze these pictures to quantify thechanges in resting behavior as the blood meals are digested.The results we find will help us better understand Aedes aegyptiviral transmission and population dynamics.A Meta-analysis of the Ralstonia Species Complex Diversity, Geographic Distribution, and Host Range Maria Charco Munoz Sponsor: Tiffany Lowe-Power, Ph.D. Plant Pathology The Ralstonia Species Complex, also first known as Ralstonia solanacearum, consists of soil-borne bacterialpathogens that cause bacterial wilt disease in many plantsincluding major crops like potato and tomato. Bacterial WiltDisease is characterized by a disease that clogs the vascularsystem of plants that results in leaves to wilt. The purpose ofthis meta-analysis study is to analyze a diverse range ofRalstonia strains, it's world-wide distribution and the broadrange of hosts it impacts and that relates to pathogenicity. Atpresent, I am analyzing peer-reviewed literature that includedata on Ralstonia Species Complex strains on a taxonomicsystem of classification known as phylotype-sequevar system. Ihave catalogued the isolation locations, isolation hosts, andphylotype-sequevar of over 500 strains. The strains wereisolated from over 50 distinct geographic regions, over 40distinct hosts, and were identified as members of over 30distinct sequevars. The work on this study is still in progress asmore literature is analyzed and information of the strains ofRalstonia are categorized. However, based on the preliminarydata, I hypothesize that Ralstonia phylotype II strains are morewidely distributed than phylotype I strains. Development of a Rotational Testbed For Cubesat Imaging Slew Requirements Ipsita Chauhan Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr This presentation discusses the research and development of amotorized rotation testbed to define reaction wheel slewrequirements in support of UC Davis' REALOP CubeSat mission.One critical goal of the REALOP mission is to capture clearimages of the Earth from low Earth orbit (LEO), requiring finelytuned attitude control from the on-board reaction wheels to limitmotion blur. This performance requirement was investigatedusing a microstepping motor to simulate a one degree-of-freedom rotational environment for testing the image quality ofa Raspberry Pi V2 Camera Module. Through varying thecamera's angular velocity, exposure, and ISO, images werecaptured and then qualitatively analyzed to determine therotation threshold that the satellite's reaction wheels mustmaintain to return clear pictures from LEO. Experimental resultsfound a maximum rotation rate of 20\u00b0/s and an exposure time of100 /uni03BCs at ISO 200 suitable for successful imaging efforts. While the motor step resolution constrained the rotational smoothnessof the testbed, this design demonstrates a low-budget optionfor student teams investigating CubeSat imaging attitude controlrequirements. The use of an environment more similar to that ofLEO, such as a frictionless air-bearing table, is recommended tobetter simulate unconstrained rotation.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 28An Empirical Analysis of How Different Face Portions Affect Emotion Recognition Through Machine Learning Models Yu-Shih Chen Sponsor: Daisuke Sato, Ph.D. MED: Pharmacology Emotion recognition is a crucial skill for humans. However, we do not know precisely how it functions. This study investigatesthe importance of different facial features by analyzingpredictions made by machine learning models. Our analysis ofthe saliency maps generated from the learned Le-Net 5convolutional neural network (CNN) model provided us withinitial motives to investigate and compare the CNN modelresults on different portions of the face. From our results of thevarious numerical experiments, we concluded that a strongerpreference for the lower portion of the face than the upperportion, which matches our saliency analysis. The result is quiteintuitive as the area around the face's mouth portion does seemto act as a strong indicator of emotions. Furthermore, the leftportion of the face seemed to be on par with the right portion ofthe face in terms of affecting the model performance. Theseresults could be interesting to future emotion recognitionresearch. Incidence and Characteristics of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth and Pancreatic Insufficiency in the Bariatric Surgery Population at UC Davis Alexis Chirco Sponsor: Victoria Lyo, M.D. MED: Surgery Obesity is a major health problem affecting over 40% ofAmericans. Bariatric surgery can safely and effectively helppatients achieve weight loss. However, small studies havesuggested that following surgery, 40% of patients develop smallintestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and 31% developpancreatic insufficiency (PI). This study investigates theincidence and clinical outcomes of SIBO and PI in bariatricpatients at UC Davis. A retrospective chart review wasperformed to collect clinical data and test results for bariatricpatients suspected of having SIBO and/or PI based ongastrointestinal symptoms. Out of 60 patients we have analyzedso far, 81% experienced diarrhea, 66% abdominal pain, and 46%bloating after surgery. Of these patients, 26% tested positive forSIBO and 25% tested positive for severe PI. These resultssuggest that SIBO and PI are common among bariatric surgerypatients with suggestive symptoms. A high degree of clinicalsuspicion for these diseases is warranted while managing thesepatients post-operatively. Ultimately, patients presenting withthese gastrointestinal symptoms should receive SIBO and PItesting to expedite treatment. Further research into the riskfactors and causes of these diseases after bariatric surgery aswell as their potential for prevention and optimal treatment isnecessary.Locating Nostalgia in Time and Space: The Colors of Seishun (Youth) in Japanese Cinema Aska Melody Chong Sponsor: Michiko Suzuki, Ph.D. East Asian Lang. & Cultures Nostalgia is an experience of intense and unresolvable longingmotivated by general sentimentality and/or attachment tospecific objects. In films, nostalgia functions to create a fictionalon-screen reality using audio-visual cues that freely manipulatetime and space. These on-screen worlds manifest varyingdegrees of nostalgia that affects the audience both collectivelyand personally during and beyond film viewing. Japanese filmsbuild uniquely nostalgic cinematic worlds that specifically appealto a culturally Japanese audience. They provide a heavilyemotionally charged film-viewing experience by employingvarious significant symbols that build up either a vague orconcrete sense of nostalgia, as seen in the two films DrowningLove (2016) and Sunny: Our Hearts Beat Together (2018). Thesefilms also thematize a romanticized view of adolescence,seishun (??), to tell a nostalgic narrative. Furthermore, althoughnostalgia is often interpreted as a longing for the past, ittranscends time and space and, in this way, adds affective depthto the modern cinematic experience. Species coexistence in randomly switching environments Tabib Chowdhury Sponsor: Sebastian Schreiber, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology According to the competitive exclusion principle, two speciescompeting for space cannot coexist under equilibriumconditions. However, when environmental conditions fluctuateand favor different species at different times, coexistence ispossible. To better understand when this can happen, weconstructed a model to simulate the dynamics of competingspecies in a stochastic environment. We put together apiecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) in which thedensities of the two species are governed by systems of lineardifferential equations that randomly reset whenever thepopulations reaches a critical density. Analytical conditions forstochastic coexistence and exclusion,were found usingLyapunov exponents which correspond to per-capita growthrates when rare. Conditions for ergodicity, which correspondsto a unique long term statistical behavior for coexisting species,are currently being established. We are also in the process ofconstructing a more periodic model to compare the long termbehavior of species coexistence between a stochastic and aperiodic environment.We demonstrate our results usingnumerical simulations.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 29Development of a Multifidelity Automotive Simulation Platform for Flexible Model Based Design of a Formula Student Race Car Blake Christierson Sponsor: Farhad Assadian, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr Motorsports simulation involves modeling a large set of complex nonlinear subsystems to accurately predict vehicle behaviornear the performance limit. The computational cost ofaddressing these intricacies becomes unmanageable whenattempting to design the hundreds of parameters that describehigh fidelity vehicle models. To circumvent this, Formula Racingat UC Davis (FRUCD) has implemented a set of multifidelitychassis, tire, suspension, controls, powertrain, andaerodynamics models. This model library allows vehicle modelsto be tailored to specific design applications by reducingcomplexity in negligible subsystems. Additionally, themultifidelity models facilitate the sequential refinement of thevehicle's design by exploiting cheap models to refine highfidelity search spaces. Furthermore, programs for steady state,transient, and lap time simulation are being developed tofacilitate varied cost evaluation providing both quick andcomprehensive design analyses. These toolsets seek to expandFRUCD's tractable design spaces by more efficiently utilizingcomputational resources through flexible simulation. Me, the Floor, & the Rhythm Ruth Christopher Sponsor: Margaret Ronda, Ph.D. English Me, the Floor, & the Rhythm is a poetry collection grown out ofthe traditions of confessional/spoken word poetry. It is based inmy study of such poets as Sylvia Plath, Audre Lorde, AndreaGibson, Ada Limon, and Saul Williams. My collection exploressuch themes as embodied female experience, dance, sexual &religious trauma, eating disorders, and familial inheritance(conscious or otherwise). Me, the Floor, & the Rhythm has atripartite construction, arranged thematically using the Sonatastructure from classical music: Exposition, Development, andRecapitulation. Within this the poems are arranged by tempo:Andante con moto or walking tempo, Allegro or fast, and Sensualmente or sensuously. With this collection I have tried topush the bounds of confessional poetry, to be brutally honestwith myself in ways that females are often not allowed to be, tosay things that we are not permitted to say. At the same time,confessional poetry is not just for exploring trauma and thedarkest recesses of our natures. It also gives space for theexpression of love, joy, sublimity, vulnerability, and everything inbetween. For this reason I have also included many poemsabout dance (the other art that I practice) and my lover.The Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Well-Being of the Asian Pacific Islander American (APIA) Population Ages 18-30 Residing in Yolo and Sacramento, California Valerie Chu Sponsor: Christian Bohringer, M.D. MED: Anesth & Pain Medicine Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, is an infectiouscommunicable respiratory illness that has affected over 100,000people throughout Sacramento and Yolo County. During thepandemic, social distancing and lockdown measures were putin place to ensure the safety of our communities. Mental healthissues have become relatively common in the youth group dueto social isolation. Our aim is to investigate, to what degree hasCOVID-19 impacted the mental well-being of the Asian & PacificIslander American (APIA) community, ages 18-30, residing in theYolo County and Sacramento City/County, CA region comparedto the Caucasian population? Our online survey asksparticipants to rate statements based on their mental health,healthcare access, and academic performances. Our survey wasopened from January 20th, 2021 to February 3rd, 2021. Oursample group (n = 147) consisted of 32 participants identifying asCaucasian and 94 participants identifying as Asian/PacifierIslander. Our data suggest that Caucasian and APIAcommunities are experiencing depressive symptoms. However,the APIA community reported having a higher impact ofnegative effects related to depression, anxiety, mood, andstress levels. In conclusion, there should be more resources tosupport the APIA community regarding their mental well-being,especially during this time. Images of the (Post)Colonial: Acts of Killing and Symptoms of Trauma in Malaysia and Indonesia Kymberley Chu Sponsor: Tarik Elhaik, Ph.D. Anthropology I aim to study photographs and films of uprisings, historicaldecolonial events, and urban landscapes in Malaysia andIndonesia. Building on what is currently called the anthropologyof images, I am analyzing aesthetics and how image-events areseen as political processes, circulatory materials that encourageacts of resistance. In addition, I draw from the tradition ofpolitical anthropology to discuss how specific political momentsin Malaysia (e.g. 2015 Bersih protests) and Indonesia (e.g. 1965-1966 Indonesian Mass Killings) emerge in the context ofhistorical decolonization, political memory, and trauma. Using acomparative and curatorial perspective, I look at the emergentforms of political resistance, capitalistic urban lifestyle, and signsof political violence-inflicted trauma. Acts of political activismand resistance in both countries are not strictly influenced byforeign colonialism and western hegemony exclusively. Forexample, Malaysia's various ethnic groups exercise their ways ofbelonging and challenge corruption in opposition to Malay-dominated authoritarianism. In Indonesia, JoshuaOppenheimer's film, The Act of Killing, demonstrates how aspectatorial logic of shame affects the cinematic practices ofportraying trauma. The film shows how perpetrators and victimsinteract after the 1965-1966 Indonesian Mass Killings. Thisresearch is for my undergraduate honors thesis inanthropology. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 30Adaptation of a Tetracycline-Inducible System for Use in Giardia lamblia Katie Chun Sponsor: Scott Dawson, Ph.D. Giardia lamblia is a binucleate parasitic protist and is responsible for a severe diarrheal disease, giardiasis. Thisorganism is the most common protozoal intestinal parasiteisolated worldwide and is associated with poor water quality.Despite its significance in global health, much is left to bediscovered about how the parasite colonizes and infects itshost. Giardia has a unique microtubule-based cytoskeleton that consists of eight flagella and a ventral disc, the latter beingessential for attachment to the host intestine upon infection. Past research in the Dawson Lab has identified several essentialcytoskeletal proteins through gene knockdown with the CRISPRinterference system, but the mechanism behind disc functionremains elusive. To further study Giardia's cytoskeleton, I adapted the tetracycline-inducible system for Giardia, allowing observation of real-time expression of any protein variant ormutation. I tested the system by inducing mNeonGreenfluorescence in Giardia's two nuclei and observing throughmicroscopy. Results indicated that the tetracycline-induciblesystem was successful in inducing fluorescence in over half ofGiardia cells. Further research will consist of optimizing theefficacy of this system and combining it with other constructs toanalyze disc assembly and knockdowns using CRISPRinterference. Examining Speech Toward Alexa versus humans: A comparison of adults and children Eva Clubb Sponsor: Georgia Zellou, Ph.D. Linguistics Voice assistants such as Alexa and Siri are now commonly usedin the home and everyday life, yet our scientific understandingof these interactions is still in its infancy. This study tests howpeople of different ages (college-age adults and children, ages7-12) talk to an Alexa device versus a human. The interactions,conducted over Zoom due to social distancing restrictions, werecontrolled so that participants said the same sentences to theAlexa and human interlocutors. Subjects see a list of 24 wordsand, on each trial, the experimenter or device asks what thenext word on the list is. The subject replies with thecorresponding word on their list (\"The word is pig\"). Then, theexperimenter or device says the word back and asks the subjectto repeat the sentence; on 4/24 of trials, the interlocutormishears the pronunciation, saying a second word with aconsonant error (\"I heard pig or pick\"). Videos are annotated inELAN and manually checked. We predict that adults andchildren will show differences in the way they adjust theirspeech for a human versus Alexa interlocutor. Broadly, this workcan reveal the impact of voice assistants on language behavioracross the lifespan.Induction of phenylpropanoid metabolism as a biomarker of early Botrytis cinerea infection in ripe strawberries Benjamin Stillman Sponsor: Barbara Blanco-Ulate, Ph.D. Plant fungal that causeslosses 90% in ripe strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa). Biomarkers of early disease, including metabolic changes in ripefruit during infection, can be used to develop accurate, fast, andnon-destructive detection methods for B. cinerea in strawberryproduction. Profiles of phenolic compounds are known tochange upon infection, and detection of these changes duringearly time points could serve as an indicator of disease. Here, Iinvestigate changes in total phenolic content (TPC) and theunderlying expression of biosynthetic genes in B. cinerea- infected strawberries. Ripe fruit (cv. Monterey) was inoculatedwith a B. cinerea suspension, then sampled at four timepointsbetween 1 and 24 hours post inoculation, with mock-inoculatedfruit as control. The same samples were analyzed by RT-qPCRto study the expression of genes involved in the committedsteps of phenylpropanoid metabolism. I anticipate changes inTPC that correlate with the expression of phenylpropanoidgenes, although the presence of paralogs in the strawberrygenome and post-transcriptional mechanisms may obscureconnections between gene expression and metabolic activity.Multispectral imaging data of inoculated fruit was also used tocharacterize temporal and spatial aspects of phenylpropanoidaccumulation in early B. cinerea infection.

However, this widespread use of social mediameans there is an increased risk of finding false information,especially for health-related topics. Message framing is afundamental component of communication strategy that caninfluence the exposure of a message. Messages can be framedto emphasize either the benefits of engaging in a behavior (again-frame), the consequences of failing to participate inbehavior (a loss-frame), or the potential danger of not adoptingrecommendations (a fear appeal). This study will develop gain-framed, loss-framed, and fear-based health messages toinvestigate the response between a population with high-use ofsocial media versus one with low-use. Participants will completea survey about their social media use, perceived level ofknowledge about these health topics, and responses to thesehealth messages in the different framings. Questions will beincluded to measure perceived accuracy, how likely they wouldbe to share the message with their social network, and self-efficacy towards behavior change. The results can be used toinvestigate how to more effectively disseminate healthmessages over social media to help individuals adopt beneficialbehaviors. Prometryn-Induced MED: Physiology & Membrane Biol Research on common pesticides used in the United States hasrevealed significant induced oxidative stress from thesepesticides in fish, plant, and mammalian cells and tissues.Atrazine and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) are twowell researched pesticides that have been found to increaseoxidative stress as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidationand significantly altered antioxidant activities in cells. The in vitroeffects of prometryn, a less common triazine herbicide, havebeen minimally researched. Additionally, research suggestscertain therapeutic agents, including Vitamin E, can alleviatecellular oxidative stress through their antioxidant capacities. Inthis study I aim to understand the in vitro effects of prometrynon cellular oxidative stress in H9c2 cardiac cells and the effectsof Vitamin E on potential prometryn-induced oxidative stress. Tocompare the relative levels of oxidative stress in eachexperiment I directly measured the cellular concentrations ofreactive oxygen species (ROS) and indirectly measured twoother indicators of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation andsuperoxide dismutase activity. Preliminary results from theGomes laboratory suggest prometryn increases cellular ROSlevels. Based on these results, I hypothesize that Vitamin E willameliorate prometryn-induced oxidative stress which will beexhibited through increased altered Sponsor: Katharine Graf Estes, Ph.D. Psychology Caregivers play a crucial role in infants' language experience.Infant-directed speech (IDS) includes features like slow speechrate, higher pitch, and word repetition than adult-directedspeech (ADS). It's believed that this speech register facilitateslanguage learning. However these features are frommonolingual studies. We know very little about bilingual IDS.The IDS literature suggests that diminutive words (i.e., kitty) isanother feature frequently used by parents talking to theirinfants. Diminutives may facilitate lexical learning because theyregulate the prosodic shape of words, helping infants segmentand learn words in their languages. The purpose of this study isto explore diminutives with Spanish-English bilingual parentsand English-speaking parents. Eight-to-20-month-olds and theirparents (N = 40) participated in a set of interactive taskscontaining objects labelled with target words in English (formonolinguals) or English and Spanish (for bilinguals). Fromcoded transcripts of the sessions, we will analyze the frequencyof diminutives use by parents. We predict bilingual parents willuse more diminutives than monolingual parents because it iscommon in Spanish for IDS nouns to be diminutivized. We willtest whether bilingual parents produce more diminutives inEnglish than monolingual English-speaking parents, suggestingan influence of the bilinguals' Spanish knowledge. Transformative Voices: Listening to and Learning From the Transgender Communities in Mexico and Peru Eric Coyle Sponsor: Robert Irwin, Ph.D. Spanish & Portuguese So often transgender individuals are burdened by improperlyused generalizations, subject to discrimination and prejudicesarising from deeply rooted transphobia, and characterized bynegative health outcomes (e.g., HIV risk) that affect themdisproportionately but do not define them. I investigatedpersonal testimonies and contextual information from media andpublished academic sources to capture the perspectives andstories of the transgender communities in Mexico and Peru.Society too often focuses on numbers and statistics,overlooking the human element of marginalized populations, sosharing the voices and aspirations from within thosecommunities is key for social progress. By using the insight ofthose directly impacted by social injustice, allies of thetransgender community and social activists in general cancreate broad alliances and develop effective campaignstargeting both the root causes and the various manifestations ofsocial injustices. Specifically, for the transgender communities inquestion, efforts must increase the visibility and appreciation oftransgender individuals across society, prevent the continuedpathologizing and stigmatization of different gender identities,and move on from narrow perceptions of gender based onbinary concepts that fail to reflect the natural diversity ofhumanity.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 32Computational and Hypothetical Drug Design of HMG- CoA Reductase Inhibitors Joseph Noel Cruz Sponsor: Justin Siegel, Ph.D. MED: Biochem & Molecular Med The drug family known inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutarate-CoA cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibiting HMGR viastatins has shown to reduce cholesterol levels in individuals withhypercholesterolemia. This study derives two novel smallmolecules by evaluating four commonly prescribed statinmedications: simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, androsuvastatin. A library of structural conformers were created foreach small molecule and were docked into the active site ofHMGR in humans and given a docking score. Among these fourinhibitors, fluvastatin exhibited the strongest binding effect witha score of -12.46. From this result, fluvastatin was designated asthe lead molecule and two new molecules were designed fromit using computational and hypothetical methods. Preliminaryresults of these newly designed drugs produced marginallybetter docking scores of -14.29 and -13.34 respectively. Slightchanges in ADMET properties in the new molecules were alsoobserved, as well as minor improvements to drug-enzymeinteractions, likely resulting in the improved docking scores overthe lead molecule. Future work will improve upon these scoresand explore how Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) mayaffect inhibitor binding. Holy Bodies: Exploring Religion, Culture, Ethics, and Sex Education Inequity among students in the Filipinx diaspora Jessica Cuenco Sponsor: Jose Ballesteros, Ph.D. Graduate Division California law defines extensive sexual education as properinstruction on: \"Human development and sexuality, infections'' (EC \u00a7 51931[b]). However, provisions suchas consent, discrimination, sexual abuse, and prevention are notunder this clause. Previous research has shown a measurablepercentage of undergraduate students enter university withoutan adequate foundation in sexual health education. Notably,BIPOC students are disproportionately affected by a lack of amandated curriculum on preventing pregnancy, abuse, LGBTQI+discrimination, and STI transmissions. Focusing on a specificgroup within the BIPOC community, this case study collects dataon Filipinx - identified university students. Research conductedby surveying and interviewing voice the transnationalperspectives of these students on their experiences and currentknowledge around sex and sexuality. This project alsodiscusses various cultural, religious, and ethical factors withinthe Filipinx diaspora that may further suggest a disconnectbetween Filipinx students and their families regarding sex. Thusfar, initial findings imply that students hailing from immigranthouseholds lack the necessary support and comprehensionfrom their families. This research attempts to bring awarenessto sex education inequity and promote healing and liberationwithin the Filipinx community. Investigating the Early Ontogeny of the Developing Hippocampus Dadra Sponsor: Simona Ghetti, Ph.D. Psychology Episodic memory for past events with retention ofthe spatio-temporal context of those events, improvessignificantly during the second year of life (Bauer & Leventon,2013). Although the hippocampus has been strongly implicatedin episodic memory processes (Vargha-Khadem et al., 1997),only recently has research reported evidence of hippocampalactivation in episodic-like memory processes in two-year-olds(Prabhakar et al., 2018). Many questions remain on the role ofstructural changes in the hippocampus and early memoryfunctioning. We examine the association between volume of theanterior and posterior hippocampal regions and memoryperformance in two-year-olds. Children participated in a 3-piecepuzzle game, assessing their spatio-temporal memory, at twotime points, immediately after being shown and after a one-week delay. At the end of the one-week delay children's sourcememory, the ability to remember when and where somethingwas learned, was assessed. Neuroimaging data were collected,while toddlers were asleep, within the next three days. Childrenreturned after a delay of several months and participated in thesource task preceding the puzzle game. Expected analyses willinclude correlations among age, hippocampal volume, andperformance. Results aim to provide insight on memory overdelay and neural correlates of episodic memory development. Determining the Relationship Between Childhood Leukemia and Drinking Water Contaminants Madeleine Dahlgren Sponsor: Damien Caillaud, D.V.M.,Ph.D. Anthropology The number of diagnosed childhood leukemia cases are risingeach year in the United States. While the cause of mostleukemia cases is largely unknown, environmental exposuresmay be contributing to this trend. One suggested cause ischemical exposure from poor quality drinking water. Currently,the relationship between drinking water contaminants andchildhood leukemia incidence remains unclear. This study aimsto provide insight into this issue through a multi-stateassessment of drinking water quality and childhood leukemiacase incidence. Water contaminant violation data from the EPA'sSafe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) FederalReporting Services and cancer data from the National CancerInstitute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program(SEER) database were analyzed at the county level for 11 states(n=100 counties). In addition, socioeconomic data from theAmerican Community Survey (ACS) were considered to provideinsight into potential community-level effects. Preliminary datasuggest that childhood leukemia rates are increasing across ourtarget states. We predict that counties that have more watersystem contaminant violations will have higher case reports.This research could help identify counties with known waterquality issues that may be contributing to health issues amongan at-risk population in the U.S.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 33Heeding Hesiod: Cautionary Tales for Iron Age Men in the Theogony and the Works and Days Christine Daniels Sponsor: Timothy Brelinski, Ph.D. Classics Though numerous scholars have analyzed Hesiod's narrative of the creation of the first woman, later named Pandora, and ofmankind, the Myth of the Ages of Men, there is still much abouttheir meaning that is disputed. To be sure, the creation ofPandora partly explains mankind's current state, one of adecline from former bliss, and one in which daily work isessential for survival. But why Hesiod, immediately afternarrating Pandora's creation, proceeds to tell the story ofmankind's origins from the beginning, in a sort of hysteronproteron arrangement, is at first sight unclear. The key tounderstanding the connection of the myth of Pandora with theAges of Men is the Iron Age. While many scholars havetraditionally interpreted the Myth of Ages as simply a story ofdecline that ends with the least valuable metal, it is better totreat the Iron Age as separate from the preceding four ages andone whose future fate is not fixed but that will be determined bythe poet's audience and their reception of his advice. Does the Nature of Rotation Matter? Assessing Infants' Mental Rotation in an Online Task. Ananya Das Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology Mental rotation, which is the ability to mentally manipulate andmake predictions about an object's orientation, is critical forunderstanding objects in our daily lives. Previous studies haverevealed sex differences during infancy, specifically that boysshow greater mental rotation than girls (Moore & Johnson,2008; Quinn & Liben, 2008, Lauer et al., 2015). The goal of thecurrent study was to assess how the nature of the rotationinfluences infants' mental rotation. We tested infants using anonline platform called Lookit (Lookit.mit.edu) that allows familiesto participate in studies from home. One-hundred-fifty infantsbetween the ages of 6 and 13 months were tested in a modifiedversion of the task used by Lauer et al. In that task, infants wereshown two stimulus streams containing identical tetris-shapeditems that repeatedly appear and disappear. On every thirdpresentation one stream contained the mirror image of the itemin the other stream. We manipulated the nature of rotation bypresenting some trials in which the items rotated sequentially(i.e., continuously and clockwise); the remaining trials were non-sequential and random. Ongoing analyses will allow us toevaluate previously observed patterns in mental rotation tasks,including age and sex-related differences.Self-Regulatory Adaptable Desk Julie Daseking Sponsor: Nicole Sparapani, Ph.D. Education Emotion regulation (ER) refers to the capacity to monitor,evaluate, and manage one's emotions and physiological arousalto meet the demands of an activity or accomplish a goal. Withina classroom environment, students are expected to maintain anoptimal state of physiological arousal to engage in learning.Although students often utilize an array of self-regulatorybehaviors to help stay well-regulated, such as rocking orstanding, classroom seating is typically not designed with this inmind. For instance, a student who benefits from vestibularsensory input cannot easily rock their four-legged or attached-to-desk chair. To help students meet their regulatory needs, thisproject focused on designing a desk that is adaptable topromote self-regulation, focus, and executive function skilldevelopment in students with varying learning needs. The firststep included conducting a comprehensive review of theliterature on ER across populations and stages of developmentand exploring options for flexible classroom seating. Next, K-12and college students, teachers, and parents volunteered tocomplete a 10-question survey to gather input on their seatingpreferences. The literature review and survey data were thenused to inform the design and development of a \"sensoryfriendly\" desk for K-12 classrooms. Mechanical and Thermal Analysis of CubeSat Structure for Simulated Launch and Orbital Environments Giancarlo Datuin Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The Space and Satellite Systems (SSS) club's REALOP missionis to create a 2U launch in 2021. TheStructures team of SSS has two analysis sub-teams: mechanicaland thermal analysis. The goal of both teams is to simulatelaunch conditions followed by a transient orbit around the Earthto verify CubeSat nominal operations. To create thesesimulations, the mechanical analysis team uses Solidworks withlaunch data provided by Nanoracks and Antares while thethermal analysis team uses Thermal Desktop. The thermalanalysis sub-team is in the process of preparing a basic modelof the CubeSat to showcase the effects of radiation on theexternal faces of the frame, as well as internal heat transferbetween the inner components/faces of the frame. This analysisdetermines if insulation or a material finish is needed, andverifies that the CubeSat survives in orbit. The mechanicalanalysis team performed 11 quasi-static tests; includingrotational, translational, and vibrational loads using restrictionssuch as remote loads to obtain Finite Element Model (FEM)mesh stresses and displacements that fall within expectations.The two teams replicate the conditions that CubeSat willundergo through the use of different software to simulatesensible mission results.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 34 The Influence of Climate Variables and Disease on Plantago lanceolata Survival Carmen David Sponsor: Jennifer Gremer, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology This project is a continuation of a study on the globally- distributed perennial plant Plantago lanceolata that has beenconducted annually since 2016. Studying global P. lanceolatapopulations in relation to climate change helps to inform thedevelopment of persistence models. The protocol of Plant PopNet, an international project, was used to execute our study.Plant Pop Net aims to comprehend the factors driving the spatialdynamics of plant populations in response to climate changeusing data from P. lanceolata populations around the globe. Atour site in Davis, CA, we measured the abundance andphenotypic traits of P. lanceolata for five years. Data collectedincludes leaf length, inflorescence length, disease presence,and other phenotypic traits. We would like to investigate theinfluence of climate variables and disease on plant survival.Using compiled data, we will look at variation in precipitationand temperature to see if there is a correlation with yearly plantsurvival. In addition, yearly survival will be compared to theproportion of plants containing disease. We predict thatindividuals with disease will experience reduced survivalcompared to those without. Further, we expect higherprecipitation and temperature to result in increased survival. Access to Emergency Contraception and Abortion Pills at California Family Planning Clinics Rozanne de Jesus Sponsor: Eleanor Schwarz, M.D.,Ph.D. MED: Int Med - Genl a risk to a woman's health.Emergency contraception (EC) pills taken within 5 days of sexcan prevent pregnancy. Levonorgestrel (Plan B ) EC pills are available throughout the United States without a prescription,but the more effective ulipristal (ella) EC pills require aprescription. When undesired pregnancy occurs, abortion pills(mifepristone and misoprostol) can be safely used up to 11weeks gestation. We assessed Californian family planningclinics' ability to provide EC and abortion pills to women seekingassistance by phone by performing a cross-sectional \"secretshopper\" survey of a 20% random sample, stratified by county,of clinics participating in California's Family Planning AccessCare and Treatment program. Of the 208 clinics we contacted,71% offered Plan B, 29% provided ella, and 12% indicated theywould be able to provide abortion pills if needed. Aconsiderable number of phone staff were not sure how torespond to women calling with a time-sensitive need for familyplanning services; specifically, 17%, 48%, and 34% did not knowif their clinic offered Plan B, Ella, and abortion pills, respectively.Efforts remain needed to increase access to EC and abortionpills for Californian families.Examining Speech Toward Alexa versus humans: A comparison of adults and children Katherine De La Cruz Sponsor: Georgia Zellou, Ph.D. Linguistics Voice assistants such as Alexa and Siri are now commonly usedin the home and everyday life, yet our scientific understandingof these interactions is still in its infancy. This study tests howpeople of different ages (college-age adults and children, ages7-12) talk to an Alexa device versus a human. The interactions,conducted over Zoom due to social distancing restrictions, werecontrolled so that participants said the same sentences to theAlexa and human interlocutors. Subjects see a list of 24 wordsand, on each trial, the experimenter or device asks what thenext word on the list is. The subject replies with thecorresponding word on their list (\"The word is pig\"). Then, theexperimenter or device says the word back and asks the subjectto repeat the sentence; on 4/24 of trials, the interlocutormishears the pronunciation, saying a second word with aconsonant error (\"I heard pig or pick\"). Videos are annotated inELAN and manually checked. We predict that adults andchildren will show differences in the way they adjust theirspeech for a human versus Alexa interlocutor. Broadly, this workcan reveal the impact of voice assistants on language behavioracross the lifespan. Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii as a Sustainable Platform for Recombinant Insulin Production Shannia Sid De Leon Sponsor: Marc Facciotti, Ph.D. Biomedical Engineering As the demand for medicine continues to grow, currentmethods of therapeutic protein production can be expensiveand unsustainable. Our project aims to genetically engineerChlamydomonas reinhardtii to produce the mini-insulinrecombinant protein in an effort to make medicine productionsustainable and cost-effective. C. Reinhardtii is a single-celledeukaryotic algae whose chloroplast is capable of producingtherapeutic-grade proteins. Because C. Reinhardtii is relativelyinexpensive and only requires sunlight, low-filtration water, aninexpensive buffer, trace minerals, CO2, and a nitrogen sourceto survive, it is an ideal platform for inexpensive proteinproduction compared to current methods. We report ourprogress towards investigating the potential of C. reinhardtii as a protein production platform, and our progress towards geneticconstruct design and algal strain engineering with mini-proinsulin as our primary candidate protein. Currently, we aredesigning our protein purification protocol for when we return tothe lab in person. The Algae to Insulin Project is part ofBioInnovation Group, which is one of the first undergraduate-run research organizations at UC Davis providing undergraduatestudents with collaborative and innovative research experience.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 35Increasing Accessibility of Healthy Davis Daily Symptom Tracker to Multilingual Communities Brenda De Leon Silva Sponsor: Prabhu Shankar, M.D. MED: Public Health Sciences The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has plagued Yolo County and Sacramento over the past year. As recommended by the Centerfor Disease Control, an understanding of the symptoms of thedisease is necessary to take control measures and preventspread of the infection. The majority of the mainstreaminformation about COVID-19 symptoms only available in theEnglish language, and families with Limited English Proficiency(LEP) are left at a disadvantage. Creating a multilingual platformcan increase accuracy of symptom capture through thetranslation of healthydavistogether.com COVID-19 symptomtracking and important information about vaccination. Theproject information will be translated into the popular languagesspoken in Yolo County which will be compiled both into a digitallibrary, as well as into a pamphlet in English and other mostcommonly spoken languages. The symptoms will be depictedwith images and checkboxes. The commonly usedrepresentations of the disease manifestations will be mapped tothe currently used English terms, as well as SNOMED-CTvocabulary. If successfully implemented and maintained, thisproject will increase awareness, data accuracy, strengthenresearch, and encourage LEP population participation in COVID-19 public health preventative measures. The model could begeneralizable to any future threats by illnesses to public health. Olfactomedin-like 3 (OLFML3) Promotes the most common adult braintumor, is uniformly lethal. As resident brain immune cells,microglia heavily infiltrate GBM to comprise 30-50% of thetumor mass. However, instead of anti-tumor activity, microgliaform a symbiosis with the tumor and facilitate its progression.While there are many contributing factors, glioma-derived TGF-\u00df1 cancers, is increased 9-fold increase in GBMpatients. Importantly, Olfml3 is a direct target gene of \u00df1, with Olfml3 mRNA increasing 50-fold upon exposure to \u00df1. to delete Olfml3 from a microglial cell line, wetested the hypothesis that microglia derivedOLFML3 increases the malignant phenotype of glioma cells(GL261). We showed that treatment with rhOLFML3 increasedGL261 migration and invasion. Moreover, GL261 pre-treatmentwith conditioned media from isogenic control microgliapreviously exposed to \u00df1 increased glioma cell migration andinvasion. However, this effect was attenuated when glioma cells were treated with conditioned media from Olfml3 -/- microglia exposed to \u00df1. Together, these data suggest that microglia derived OLFML3 contributes to the malignant phenotype ofmouse glioma cells.Assessing the Drivers of Genetic Diversity on Coral Reefs Robert Dellinger Sponsor: Rachael Bay, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology Coral reefs in the Anthropocene face a profound decline from aculmination of global and local threats. Genetic diversity canserve as the raw material for adaptation, buffering species fromthe effects of such stressors, yet large-scale surveys betweenand across species of coral are lacking. Therefore, it is essentialto assess the drivers of genetic diversity and its consequencesfor recovery. Here we compile a global database of geneticdiversity from microsatellites in species of Acropora, the largestcoral genus. We use expected heterozygosity as a measure ofdiversity, and compare this to both species trait and spatialenvironmental data to uncover the drivers of this diversity.Preliminary analyses show that pH and species' upper depthlimit are the variables most strongly associated with geneticdiversity. Additionally, we find that the Caribbean Acroporapalmata has unexpectedly high genetic diversity, the highest ofany Acroporid species. These findings suggest that there isevidence for species-specific genetic diversity levels and thatabiotic factors and anthropogenic induced stressors mayinfluence the genetic diversity of the genus Acropora.Considering the importance of genetic diversity amongstpopulations, management strategies can utilize the informationof allelic diversity to generate an assessment of large-scaleecological change. Developing a Model for Community-Driven Single-Use Plastic Reduction in Local Restaurants Sabrina Denton Sponsor: Andrea Schreier, Ph.D. Animal Science The presence of plastic waste in the oceans poses a majorthreat to marine ecosystems. Numerous marine organismsbecome entangled in or unintentionally ingest plastic debris,and yet, much of the population is unaware of theconsequences of single-use plastics. This project aims toinvestigate single-use plastic consumption in local restaurants inDavis in order to develop a collaborative model that can beadapted to support and encourage restaurants to transitionaway from single-use plastics in Davis and other cities. Thiscollaborative model would allow project stakeholders to usesocial capital to incentivize the reduction of single-use plastic inrestaurants through community promotion. We will conductresearch regarding conventional material costs, costs ofalternatives, how current businesses incorporate compostableproducts, and consumer preference for sustainable materials.By investigating the cost and process of transitioning fromconventional to compostable materials, we can determine thefeasibility of convincing local businesses to employ this modelthroughout the city.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 36Balance Control Strategies During Perturbed central nervous system uses distinct strategies involving the ankle and hip joints to compensate for altered sensoryconditions while standing and maintaining balance. Inhandstand balancing, since the body is inverted, thesestrategies correspond to the wrist and elbow joints. Recentstudies have shown that visual perturbations alter the balancingstrategies to increase the proportion of time spent balancingusing the elbow joint. In this preliminary study, we examined theinfluence of visual and physical perturbations on handstandbalancing by using balancing blocks to change the position ofthe hand; rather than placing the hands flat on the floor, thehands gripped the blocks with fingers curled. We examined atrained gymnast performing handstands on the floor and withthe blocks, with the eyes either open or closed. We found thatthe balancing strategies during the control condition (handstandon the floor with eyes open) significantly changed with the visualand physical perturbations. Simultaneous perturbations had asomewhat additive effect on the use of the elbow strategy.Together, our preliminary results suggest that visual (via theeyes closed) and physical perturbations (via changing the handposition) differentially affect the strategies used by the centralnervous system to maintain balance. Optimization of Armillaria mellea Growth Media Janessa Destremps Sponsor: Patrick james Brown, Ph.D. Plant Sciences The Armillaria mellea is a known causal agent ofArmillaria Root Rot (ARR) which affects many agronomicallyimportant crops such as walnuts. One of the most commonrootstock varieties used for walnuts, Paradox, is susceptible toARR. ARR is a difficult disease to control and leads to reductionsin crop yields and growth. The goal of this project is to developand optimize a soil-based screening assay for A. mellearesistance that can be performed rapidly using small clonalwalnut rootstock plants. Cultured A. mellea was grown indifferent conditions to measure its virulence and growth. Theseconditions included varying percentages of soil (sunshine #4)and Paradox wood chips from the Paradox rootstock. Threemonths post inoculation, cultures with higher percentages ofParadox wood chips than sunshine #4 showed better growth. Amix of 50% Paradox wood chips and 50% sunshine #4 was theleast amount of Paradox wood chips that still supportedmycorrhizae and rhizomorph growth. Additionally, A. mellea grew best in autoclaved media free from other microbes as it issusceptible to competition. Based on these findings, thevirulence of A. mellea depends on the media it is grown in aswell as the surrounding competition.Bioinformatics Analysis of Novel Genes Associated With Tomato Fruit Postharvest Quality Janessa Destremps Sponsor: Diane Beckles, Ph.D. Plant Sciences Tomatoes are universally popular, high in fiber and antioxidants,and are revered for the 'authenticity' they add to many culturaldishes. However, consumers have expressed unhappiness withthe quality of store-bought tomatoes, because trades-offs madewith respect to enhancing shelf-life and optimizing quality. Toprolong shelf-life, tomatoes may be harvested before they reachfull ripe and stored for variable periods before consumption,conditions that destroy fruit quality compared to fruit harvestedwhen ripe. The genes that are affected by different postharveststorage conditions have not been fully characterized, but abetter understanding of their mode of action may help toimprove tomato quality. Transcriptomics and methylomics wereused to identify genes whose expression changed in concertwith changes in tomato fruit quality due to different postharvesthandling. Several differentially expressed genes were identified,many of which have not been previously implicated in tomatofruit quality. In this work, we initiated a bioinformatic analysis ofthese genes and their cognate gene families, in tomato andother species, to determine if they are universally involved infruit quality or ripening. This is the first step towards theirfunctional analysis in fruit, using reverse genetics approaches,and long-term improvement in commercial fruit quality. The Palm Oil Dilemma and Rethinking Carbon Neutrality Calculations Jenna Deutschman Sponsor: Sue Vang, M.S. CP: Environmental Stewardship Palm oil is the most widely used oil and a highly fungibleresource found in common products. However, palm oilproduction requires a tropical rainforest climate and is thus adriver of deforestation and peatland destruction. To understandthe scope of the problem, palm properties, economic drivers,and various emission measurement methods were assessed. Tofind a feasible alternative to palm oil, other oil sources werecompared against palm oil based on climate zone, globalwarming potential, crop yield, soil toxicology, and deforestationhistory. When evaluated against the criteria, palm oil proved tobe the most overall environmentally damaging oil. Despite theproblems palm oil presents, there exists no effective marketregulation; the current leading \"sustainable\" palm oil certificationprograms are demonstrated to be unreliable. Palm oil demandmust not increase to stop rapid peatland destruction anddeforestation. Because of the global palm oil dependency andlack of effective sustainable certification programs, bothgovernment and consumer action are necessary to controldeforestation and peatland destruction. The results challengesustainability certification programs, emission measurementmethods, and the scope for carbon neutrality.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 37The Correlation Between B1 cells and cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease characterized by the immune-mediated inflammatory destructionof small bile ducts. However, the underlying mechanisms of PBC are largely unknown. Since the presence of hyper-IgM isone of the characteristic features of PBC, we aim to investigatewhat drives hyper-IgM production and whether hyper-IgMexerts a pathogenic role in PBC. To do so, we took advantageof a murine model to study B1 cells from the peritoneal cavity,since B1 cells are the main resource for IgM antibodies. Wespecifically used models with AU-Rich Element deletion, whichresults in chronic elevated interferon-gamma levels and hyper-IgM levels. We measured IgM levels in the serum and extractedB1 cells from the peritoneal cavities. We then stained peritonealcavity cells with the antibodies against cell surface markersCD5, CD11b, IgM, and B220 to identify B1 and IgM-expressingpopulations in each model. Our results showed that there weresignificant increases in B1 cells and IgM-expressing cells in thePBC model vs. the wild type control. Based on these significantfindings, we will be able to further investigate the pathogenesisof primary biliary cholangitis in relation to hyper-IgM levels. and of Immigrants Sheyla Mirka Dirzo Sponsor: Jeffrey Sherman, Ph.D. Psychology The Stereotype Content Model (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002)argues that competence and warmth are the criticalcomponents of social stereotypes, and people view immigrantsas low-competence and low-warmth. However, a growingliterature argues that stereotypes about immigrants areintersectional \u2014 depending on the origin country, race, andsocioeconomic status (Lee & Fiske, 2006; Martinez,Feldman, Feldman, & Cikara, 2021). In the current work, weexamined how stereotypes about warmth/competence andsocioeconomic status depend on an immigrant's origin country.The stimuli in the task were previously constructed faces ofimmigrants and U.S. citizens of various ethnicities and countriesof birth created by UC Davis students(Hutchings et al., in prep).UC Davis students will rate the competence, warmth, education-level, and wealth of Canadian, Chinese, and Mexican immigrantand U.S. citizen faces. We predicted that the faces of immigrantsappeared more threatening and less trustworthy compared tothose of U.S citizenship. This work has importantimplications forshifting the perspective on stereotypes given most stereotypeformation/bias is focused on outdated stereotypes.Buffering Capacity of Standard Model Foods as Related to Simulated Gastric Digestion Raymond Doan Sponsor: Gail Bornhorst, Ph.D. Biological & Ag Engineering Food buffering capacity influences intragastric pH duringdigestion, which can affect food breakdown, acid secretion, andmay have health implications. The objective of this study was tocharacterize the buffering capacity of two model foods withmacronutrient composition based on the Standard AmericanDiet. Model foods were prepared as aqueous dispersions andsolidified using thermal gelation. A strong and weak version ofthe model food were prepared by modulating dispersion pH .Buffering capacity was measured on dispersions (beforegelation), large cubes (1.3 cm), and small cubes (0.65 cm) aftergelation. Buffering capacity was measured by taking the pH of20 g sample while adding 0.5 mL aliquots of 0.16 M HCl until anendpoint pH of 1.5 was reached. Experiments were completedin triplicate. Total buffering capacity was not significantlyinfluenced by type of model food (p>0.05), but was significantlyinfluenced by model food physical form (p<0.05). The weak gelin dispersion form had the highest total buffering capacity (106 /uni03BCmol H + per (g sample \u00d7 total pH change)). The physical form of a model food (large cubes, small cubes, or dispersion) influenced total buffering capacity. This information could helpfuture researchers design functional foods for improved humanhealth. Legal Consciousness Among Legal Aid Workers: A Narrative Analysis Rachel Drizin Sponsor: Timm Grattet, Ph.D. Sociology Legal consciousness is a critical concept in legal sociology. Itaddresses the ways in which the legal system maintainslegitimacy and explores the key ways in which laypersonscontribute to the function and structure of law. Recognizing thatcontribution, this study seeks to further analyze the function oflaw and legality within legal institutions themselves by applyingthe legal consciousness framework developed by Patricia Ewickand Susan Silbey in the book The Common Place of Law:Stories from Everyday Life in combination with access to justiceand transformation of disputes literatures. As legal aid workersserve low-income individuals that often lack legal access,examining this population provides insight into the function,social power, and understanding of law at its margins. Interviewsranging from 45 minutes to 2 hours will be conducted with 15-20 legal aid workers. These data will be analyzed for the fourelements of legal consciousness identified by Ewick and Silbey:normativity, constraint, capacity, and locality of law. Interviewsand analysis are ongoing, but early analysis indicates thepresence of both multiple legal consciousnesses, consistentwith existing literature, and unique forms or variants ofpreviously identified legal consciousnesses.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 38Does the Nature of Rotation Matter? Assessing Infants' Mental Rotation in an Online Task. Anthony Easter III Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology Mental rotation, which is the ability to mentally manipulate and make predictions about an object's orientation, is critical forunderstanding objects in our daily lives. Previous studies haverevealed sex differences during infancy, specifically that boysshow greater mental rotation than girls (Moore & Johnson,2008; Quinn & Liben, 2008, Lauer et al., 2015). The goal of thecurrent study was to assess how the nature of the rotationinfluences infants' mental rotation. We tested infants using anonline platform called Lookit (Lookit.mit.edu) that allows familiesto participate in studies from home. One-hundred-fifty infantsbetween the ages of 6 and 13 months were tested in a modifiedversion of the task used by Lauer et al. In that task, infants wereshown two stimulus streams containing identical tetris-shapeditems that repeatedly appear and disappear. On every thirdpresentation one stream contained the mirror image of the itemin the other stream. We manipulated the nature of rotation bypresenting some trials in which the items rotated sequentially(i.e., continuously and clockwise); the remaining trials were non-sequential and random. Ongoing analyses will allow us toevaluate previously observed patterns in mental rotation tasks,including age and sex-related differences. Numerical Simulation of Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Quantum Spin Dynamics Using QuTIP Sarah Edwards Sponsor: Nicholas Curro, Ph.D. Physics Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, defects in diamond latticeswhose quantum properties can be manipulated using anexternal magnetic field, are popular in solid-state magnetometryand quantum information for their high sensitivity and longcoherence times. Typically, NV centers are treatedexperimentally as two-level systems, considering only the spin =0 and spin = +1 or -1 cases. However, the full spin-1 multiplet canbe exploited to increase sensitivity in AC magnetometry bytaking into consideration all three possible orientations of theNV electronic spin, a method referred to as double-quantumcoherence. This can be difficult, as existing computationalmethods for numerically solving differential equations often failto accurately represent mixed quantum states. This projectexplores various numerical methods for computing these mixedstates for magnetic pulse sequences in AC magnetometry viadouble-quantum coherence using QuTip (qutip.org), a quantumcomputing package for Python, with the aim of developingtechniques to efficiently model double-quantum coherence inNV centers. An Analysis of Plant-based Volatile Compounds and Their Precursors That Mimic the Umami Flavor of Meat Benjamin Elliott Sponsor: J German, Ph.D. Food Science & Technology Humans are innately drawn to the flavors and aromas in meat.We crave it, the thought of it makes our mouths water. But whatis the \"it\" factor in meat that makes it so irresistible, and why dohumans continue to choose meat from animals over the plant-based alternatives available on the market today. Flavor isincredibly complex and is linked with many different compoundsand their interactions with one another. This paper researchesthe volatile compounds and flavor molecules, as well as theirprecursors, that make meat desirable. The source of the fat,whether from an animal or a plant, makes a difference in theflavor compounds produced during the cooking process. Thispaper looks at plant-sourced fats that may produce similarcompounds when cooked to the ones found in meat. TheMaillard reactions that cause browning in meats are greatlyimpacted by the amino acid content. Exploring the amino acidcontents of plant-based foods that have meat-like umami flavor,such as mushrooms, nutritional yeast, and soy in comparisonwith those of meat products, could lead to the discovery ofwhat makes meat delicious. Canonizing the Uncanny: The Power of Spiral Sight in Patricia Grace's Potiki Eli Elster Sponsor: Tobias Menely, Ph.D. have noted the \"spiral temporality\" used byPatricia Grace in her 1986 novel Potiki, which treats the past,present and future as simultaneous and uniformly accessible\u2014yet no one has connected spiral time to the uncanny, an equallypresent and urgent phenomena in the novel. In this paper, Iexamine how the uncanny works upon both the colonizers (landdevelopers) and colonized (a small Maori community, named theTamihanas); how, for either side, it relates to a certainunderstanding of time; and how spiral time manifests, for theTamihanas, as a \"spiral sight,\" which allows them, namely, tocanonize the uncanny. My main example concerns theTamihanas's battle with the developers over their land, as bothsides react to their nemeses with a mix of uncanny fear anddissociative agnosia. Their reactions fit within a tropologicalframework described by Alan Lawson, who also clarifies andcalls for, in his work, a version of spiral sight. Additionally, Ipropose a broader category, termed here a \"practicaltemporality,\" within which to place modes of praxis that stemfrom non-Cartesian temporalities. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 39Assessing Behavioral Changes in Offspring Raised in a Single-Parent Environment Using the Rock Dove as a Model Organism Daniel Erenstein Sponsor: Rebecca Calisi, Ph.D. Neuro Physio & Behavior Nearly one-quarter of children in the United States live in a single-parent household, the highest rate of any country in theworld. Previous research about single-parent households hasfound that children with single parents experience changes tothe amygdala\u2014the brain region controlling fear and stressbehaviors\u2014that often result in anxiety, depression, andwithdrawal, outcomes that can be reflected in adulthood.However, the underlying molecular and cellular changes to theamygdala are not fully understood. This study aims to examineamygdala changes in single-parent offspring at the cellular,molecular, and behavioral levels using the rock dove (Columbalivia) as a model organism. First, we will assess behavioralchanges in squabs at day 5 post-hatch and then characterizemolecular changes to the amygdala. Twelve-hour videorecordings are scored using the BORIS system for codingstandardized measurements of squab behavior, including headwaggle and bill searching. Based on previous studies, weexpect to see an increase in anxiety-like behaviors of squabsfrom single-parent environments compared to those from dual-parent environments. Overall, our research contributes to anunderstanding of the impacts of single parenting on children,specifically contributions of the amygdala\u2014the brain's emotionalcenter\u2014to behavioral changes in humans. Redesigning the Prosthetic Leg: a Design for a Healthier Lifestyle. Janet Escobar-Hernandez Sponsor: Jonathon Schofield, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr As technology becomes more advanced, the quality ofprosthetics increase, decreasing affordability and deprivingmany of access to these devices. With an increase in the needfor innovation and cost-effective prostheses, our team is set ondesigning a higher performance prosthetic using sustainableand affordable materials. Working with a leg amputee directly,our below-the-knee prosthetic leg prioritizes comfort andadaptability for an active lifestyle. Our design is divided into 3main parts being the pylon, socket, and foot. We conducted aconcept screening to define the core concepts within each part.These include a vertically rotating ankle, self-molding socketinterior, and a shape that allows for full range of motion at theknee. We are currently developing the pylon and the foot of ourdesign by conducting extensive material and biomechanicsresearch to achieve optimal performance during the Gait cyclewhile walking and jogging, turning, and even going up anddown stairs. Throughout the process we will validate and verifyour design to ensure the client's needs are properly assessed.Once we establish a working design, we will create a CADmodel and proceed with the testing and prototyping phases.Learning to Look in a Pandemic: An Exploration on the Impact of Masks on Infant Facial Recognition Savannah Espinola Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology From birth, infants preferentially look to the faces in theirenvironment. Across the first year of life, infants prioritizedifferent regions of the face (e.g., the eyes or mouth) as variousvisual cues become more or less relevant. For example, asinfants learn language, they may prioritize their attention to themouth of a speaker (Lewkowicz & Hansen-Tift, 2012). As aresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have become apart of daily life for many Americans, raising the question: willface masks affect our ability to recognize one another? Studiesinvestigating this question have found that adults are impairedat both learning and recognizing faces with masks (Carragher &Hancock, 2020). Given the importance of faces for infants'learning, we tested whether infants would show differentiallearning and recognition patterns to masked and unmaskedfaces. Additionally, we asked parents to report on their infant'sexperience seeing people wear face masks. To date, we havetested approximately 50 infants aged 4- to 12-months onlineand are currently analyzing this data to present in the Spring.This work will contribute to our understanding of how variousaspects of facial input are related to infants' learning across thefirst year of life. Making Fishtory: Observing Juvenile Salmon Growth Through Archival Tissue. Kimberly Evans Sponsor: Rachel Johnson, Ph.D. John Muir Institute-environ California Central Valley (CCV) Chinook Salmon are born infreshwater, eventually enduring a vulnerable migration to theocean to carry out the majority of their lives before returning tofreshwater to spawn. The life transition for juveniles betweenfreshwater and the ocean creates the following question: whereare the most viable environments for preparing juvenile ChinookSalmon for this outmigration? Different habitats provide diverseenvironmental conditions, leading to differential growthopportunities for salmon. We investigate how regions of theSacramento Sutter Bypass in 2019 impacted the growth of CCVChinook Salmon prior to completing their departure fromfreshwater into the ocean. We hypothesized that salmon rearingin the Sutter Bypass would have increased growth rates due tothe less competitive environment, greater abundance of food,and decreased predation. To test for growth variation indifferent habitats, I utilized a common metric for observing fishgrowth through analyzing the width of daily growth bandsrecorded in archival tissues called otoliths. This method helpedto determine how fast the Sutter Bypass salmon grew while inexperimental enclosures and captured in the wild in comparisonto other locations. Through this research, conservationists arebetter able to target key habitats for this native species.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 40Exploring the Relation between Contextual Attention and Theory of Mind in Children Kate Everhardt Sponsor: Lindsay Bowman, Ph.D. Psychology Theory of Mind (ToM) describes the understanding that internal mental states, such as desires, beliefs and thoughts, guideexternal behavior in the real world. ToM is foundational tofunctioning in the social world, including teaching, moraljudgements and cooperation. This understanding developsdramatically from ages 3- to 8-years, but more research isneeded to uncover all of the contributing factors (e.g., languagedevelopment) that support the transition to a matureunderstanding of others' mental states. This project will examinea theoretically important but underexplored contributor tochildren's ToM: the ability to attend to contextual information ina scene, and to use that information to inform judgementsabout a character's mental state. Prior research has shownreliable individual differences in children's context sensitivitythat are independent of other non-social skills (e.g., executivefunction). The present study examines children's attention tocontextual information in both social and non-social scenes, andhow individual differences in these skills relate to ToM inchildren ages 4- to 8-years-old. The research study is ongoing,data collection will be done through an online platform, andresults and analyses will be completed by spring of 2021. A Population-Based Modeling Approach to Investigate the Mechanisms Regulating Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Electrophysiology in Health and blood pressureregulation, is controlled by the coordinated contraction andrelaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Sinceregulation of SMC contractile state is impaired in diseasedconditions like hypertension (HT) and diabetes, therapeutictreatment requires better characterization of the subcellularmechanisms controlling SMC electrophysiology. Here, we aim toinvestigate differences in the response to vasoconstrictor andvasodilator stimuli in control and HT SMCs. We randomlymodified the parameters of an established mathematical modelof rat mesenteric SMCs to create two populations of control andHT cells. We simulated norepinephrine (NE) and nitric oxide(NO) administration, and assessed the changes in membranepotential and cytosolic Ca concentration in each model of thetwo populations. We performed linear regression analysis onthe population data to determine the role of ion channels andtransporters in the control of SMC electrophysiology before andafter NE/NO stimulation. Completion of this study will allow thecharacterization of variability in populations of SMCs, and theidentification of the key mechanisms that could be targetedtherapeutically to restore SMC function in HT.Pilot Study comparing blood and urine concentrations and pharmacokinetics of Flunixin Meglumine Mclean, Ph.D. Animal Science Recognizing signs of pain or discomfort in donkeys can bedifficult due to both their natural instinct to mask signs ofweakness as well as their \"stoic\" demeanors. Even when theirpain is identified, donkeys are not always cooperative when itcomes to accepting treatment. They are known to hidemedication in their mouths and their thicker cutaneous collimuscle makes intravenous drug administration especiallydifficult. One common analgesic, Flunixin Meglumine(Banamine), is available in an injectable, oral, and more recently,a transdermal form. Proven effective in cattle, this newcutaneous mode has the potential to be a safer and moremanageable alternative to administering flunixin. The specificaim of this study is to compare the pharmacodynamics andpharmacology of three routes of flunixin in donkeys (e.g. oral,injectable, dermal). Six donkeys will be used in a three waycrossover design in which both blood and urine samples will betaken over a 96-hour timeframe for determination of drug andeicosanoid concentrations. The results from pharmacokineticanalysis will be evaluated using appropriate statistical methods.This study could be the first step towards proving that thedermal version of Flunixin can conveniently and effectivelyimprove the overall wellbeing of donkeys. Vision for the agricultural system in 2050 Yuting Fan Sponsor: J German, Ph.D. Food Science & Technology The current agriculture and food system is devastating theenvironment and damaging people's health. The massiveamount of resources required for agricultural production isimpacting the entire world. A significant proportion of foodproducts are wasted at every step along the way fromproduction to consumption. A central problem weaving its waythrough all of agriculture, linking inefficiency, waste and evenhealth is the perishability of foods. If the problem of foodinstability were solved, harvesting, transportation, processingand health can take advantage of multiple innovativetechnologies of the modern world. The problems existing in thecurrent food system can be addressed by a single concept--processing. Instead of public perception of processing as an evilinvention, innovative processing can be the key to safelystabilizing perishable food products. After foods are madestable, it will be possible to incorporate the global food systeminto modern computational models of supply, inventory control,byproduct recovery and precision health. The immediatebenefits will be to accurately deliver foods according topersonal needs using everything from autonomous delivery tohandheld devices. By 2050, such a food system would improvethe environment, capture waste and nourish the most healthy,active and joyous generation in human history.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 41Development of a Low-Cost and Reliable Reaction Wheel for CubeSat Attitude Control Forrest Fankhauser Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr This presentation discusses the development of a low-cost Manufactured Reaction Wheel (MRW) system for the REALOPmission, UC Davis's first and completely undergraduate-ledCubeSat mission. Commercial reaction wheel systems typicallyexceed budgets for university missions, so the motor andreaction wheels are independently acquired and joined with athermal-press fit to ensure cost-effectiveness and reliability.Once in orbit, the MRW will autonomously stabilize and preciselyorient the CubeSat so that the satellite's visible light andinfrared cameras can take clear photos. The MRW controlsystems team is developing a methodology to find a PIDcontroller which meets the mission requirements. This processbegins with finding a model of the system, applying and tuningthe controller, then verifying results with physical testing. Ageneral approach allows for testing on low-cost motors, inpreparation for quick and safe tuning of the assembled MRW.Many university CubeSat missions are hindered by the expenseof reaction wheel systems; successful use and thoroughdocumentation of REALOP's Manufactured Reaction Wheelsystem will provide future missions with easier access to low-cost, reliable reaction wheel systems. Structural Racism in Scientific Literature Yasameen Farahvash Sponsor: John Furlow, Ph.D. Neuro Physio & Behavior The ways in which we describe scientific data and results inresearch articles often lack racial inclusivity and sensitivity. Forexample, using the white race as the reference group inmultivariable analyses normalizes the white experience as thestandard experience, thereby implicitly acknowledging theexistence of racial hierarchies. In this project, we investigatedhow structural racism pervades the scientific literature byexamining the use of the white race as the reference group inobservational public health studies in the United States. Ourinitial search identified 1,849 articles, of which we reviewed thetop 300 based on relevancy. After screening for specificinclusion criteria, 88 articles were retained for full dataextraction. Of these, 83 used \"white\" as the reference group;however, not all had \"white\" as the largest demographic group,a common rationale for determining the reference group. Thescientific literature includes widespread use of the white race asthe standard to which all other race and ethnicity outcomes arecompared. Future efforts must support the elimination of thewhite-centric frame of thinking that negatively influencesscientific research and undermines important outcomes at theintersection of race and public health.An Affinity-Tagged Allele of the Breast Cancer Associated Gene BRCA2 to Investigate Meiotic Recombination in Mice Claire Fargeix Sponsor: Neil Hunter, Ph.D. Microbiology & Molec Genetics Meiosis is the process by which haploid eggs and sperm areproduced from diploid germ cells. The chromosome repairprocess called homologous recombination is essential formeiosis and more generally for enhancing genetic diversity andenhancing genomic integrity. Breast Cancer Associated Gene 2,or BRCA2, encodes a protein that mediates proper homologous recombination. Mistakes in meiotic recombination can result ininfertility, miscarriage, and congenital disease, so it is vital thatwe understand how this process works and how it can gowrong. To study BRCA2 function in meiosis, we created ahemagglutinin (HA) tagged version of the mouse gene, BRCA2-3HA, using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique. In orderto confirm that the tag does not affect the function of theessential BRCA2 protein, and thereby the fitness of the mice, Iexamined the number and size of the litters born to females withand without BRCA2-3HA. I also analyzed the chromosomallocalization of several proteins, RAD51, DMC1, RPA, and MLH1specifically, involved in recombination during meiosis. Showingthat the BRCA2-3HA allele is fully functional in mouse willeliminate any ambiguity regarding results obtained usingBRCA2-3HA mice and our findings using this novel tool. Identifying Breed Differences in Abnormal Repetitive Behaviors of Dairy Heifers: Effects of Feed-Related Stress on Non-Nutritive Oral Manipulation Ashley Felsch Sponsor: Cassandra Tucker, Ph.D. Animal Science Dairy cattle are motivated to consume forage and perform oralabnormal repetitive behaviors when feed is restricted in farmsettings. Common dairy breeds, Jerseys and Holsteins, differ intime spent foraging in their natural environment. If abnormalbehaviors serve as a way to replicate frustrated natural foragingbehaviors, then these breeds should differ in their response tofeed restriction. Our objective is to assess whether Jersey andHolstein heifers differ in time performing oral abnormalrepetitive behaviors in response to precision feeding, a commonpractice in commercial dairies that restricts time spent eating.Thirty-three Holstein and nine Jersey heifers were limited to50% of their previous food intake for two days. On the secondday of restriction, all heifers were recorded for 24 hours tomeasure the time engaged in abnormal behaviors. Wehypothesize that Jerseys will experience more frustration inresponse to limited feeding time, as they naturally spend moretime feeding than Holsteins. We expect they will spendsignificantly more time performing oral abnormal repetitivebehaviors, including tongue rolling, tongue play, and non-nutritive oral manipulation of pen structures and bedding, thanHolstein heifers.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 42Is it Gato or Gatito? Diminutives in Spanish-English Servin Sponsor: Katharine Graf Estes, Ph.D. Psychology Caregivers play a crucial role in infants' language experience. Infant-directed speech (IDS) includes features like slow speechrate, higher pitch, and word repetition than adult-directedspeech (ADS). It's believed that this speech register facilitateslanguage learning. However these features are frommonolingual studies. We know very little about bilingual IDS.The IDS literature suggests that diminutive words (i.e., kitty) isanother feature frequently used by parents talking to theirinfants. Diminutives may facilitate lexical learning because theyregulate the prosodic shape of words, helping infants segmentand learn words in their languages. The purpose of this study isto explore diminutives with Spanish-English bilingual parentsand English-speaking parents. Eight-to-20-month-olds and theirparents (N = 40) participated in a set of interactive taskscontaining objects labelled with target words in English (formonolinguals) or English and Spanish (for bilinguals). Fromcoded transcripts of the sessions, we will analyze the frequencyof diminutives use by parents. We predict bilingual parents willuse more diminutives than monolingual parents because it iscommon in Spanish for IDS nouns to be diminutivized. We willtest whether bilingual parents produce more diminutives inEnglish than monolingual English-speaking parents, suggestingan influence of the bilinguals' Spanish knowledge. Reimagining Counseling Services and the Power of Traditional Healing for Undocumented Immigrants Ofelia Ferreyra Ruiz Sponsor: Susy Zepeda, Ph.D. Chicano Studies Through my initial research, it has come to my attention thatunderserved communities, such as undocumented immigrants,are very resistant to counseling services. I argue that they areunable to connect with the Western ideologies that are utilizedin counseling services. Reason being, undocumentedimmigrants seek out their culture's traditional healing practicesand affirmations for a body, mind, and spirit holistic approach. Inmy research, I focus on the innovative possibility of integratingtraditional healing practices into counseling services as apathway to provide the most effective and sustaining care to theundocumented community. To explore this possibility, I will bevirtually interviewing six UC Davis undocumented students tolearn about their experiences with mental health services andculturally relevant traditional healing practices. I will also beinterviewing four on-campus counselors at UC Davis to inquireabout their practices. I expect my research findings will yieldknowledge on how we can reimagine counseling services into adynamic system that is accessible, inclusive, and transformativefor the undocumented community.Income Inequality Outcomes of Asset Price Bubbles Tomer Fidelman Sponsor: Giovanni Peri, Ph.D. Economics While there has been a growing literature regarding the impactof different forms of economic downturn on the aggregatemeasures of nations, there has been little evidenced basedresearch regarding the direct effect on income groups of thesecountries. This paper examines the implications of economicdownturn, focusing on specific types of asset price bubbles, onvarying income shares across 17 advanced economies,centering on years 1945 and onward. Obtained results from localprojections models indicate that the top and bottom incomegroups respond uniquely to different asset price bubbles, andrecover in patterns that challenge current consensus. Bycomparing findings across nations of varying inequality, as wellas time periods of differing inequality, the models utilizedidentify consistent response trends in the aftermath of assetprice bubbles. Lastly, the analysis offers a nuanced view of whathigh income inequality growth can mean for nationsexperiencing various asset price bubbles. The development of social attention in infants at risk for autism and ADHD Nat Finnegan Sponsor: Meghan Miller, Ph.D. MED: Psychiatry & Sci Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) likely share genetic traits,and studies have implicated atypical patterns of attention inboth syndromes. However, no study has yet examinedattentional differences between infants developing high ASDsymptoms, high ADHD symptoms, and low symptoms. Weexamined group differences in early looking patterns at 12, 18,and 24 months of age during an eye-tracking task of socialpreference among infants at familial risk for ASD (n=48), familialrisk for ADHD (n=36), or low-risk for both (n=35). At 24 months, the children were classified into outcome groups reflecting highASD symptoms (n=28), high ADHD symptoms (n=23), or low symptoms (n=46). The social preference task consisted of two paired video clips: One displaying social stimuli and the otherdisplaying non-social stimuli. At 12 months of age, the highASD-symptom group looked significantly more at the socialtarget than the other two groups. From 12-36 months, the high-ASD symptom group demonstrated declining trajectories of timespent looking at social stimuli, while the low symptom groupsignificantly increased looking times to social stimuli; the high-ADHD symptom group showed a trend toward increasing sociallooking times. The mechanisms underlying attentionalprocesses in ADHD and ASD may differ. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 43The Influence of Climate Variables and Disease on Plantago lanceolata Survival Samuel Flohr Sponsor: Jennifer Gremer, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology This project is a continuation of a study on the globally- distributed perennial plant Plantago lanceolata that has beenconducted annually since 2016. Studying global P. lanceolatapopulations in relation to climate change helps to inform thedevelopment of persistence models. The protocol of Plant PopNet, an international project, was used to execute our study.Plant Pop Net aims to comprehend the factors driving the spatialdynamics of plant populations in response to climate changeusing data from P. lanceolata populations around the globe. Atour site in Davis, CA, we measured the abundance andphenotypic traits of P. lanceolata for five years. Data collectedincludes leaf length, inflorescence length, disease presence,and other phenotypic traits. We would like to investigate theinfluence of climate variables and disease on plant survival.Using compiled data, we will look at variation in precipitationand temperature to see if there is a correlation with yearly plantsurvival. In addition, yearly survival will be compared to theproportion of plants containing disease. We predict thatindividuals with disease will experience reduced survivalcompared to those without. Further, we expect higherprecipitation and temperature to result in increased survival. Assessing Drivers of Genetic Diversity On Coral Reefs John Amiel Flores Sponsor: Rachael Bay, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology Coral reefs in the Anthropocene face a profound decline from aculmination of global and local threats. Genetic diversity canserve as the raw material for adaptation, buffering species fromthe effects of such stressors, yet large-scale surveys betweenand across species of coral are lacking. Therefore, it is essentialto assess the drivers of genetic diversity and its consequencesfor recovery. Here we compile a global database of geneticdiversity from microsatellites in species of Acropora, the largestcoral genus. We use expected heterozygosity as a measure ofdiversity, and compare this to both species trait and spatialenvironmental data to uncover the drivers of this diversity.Preliminary analyses show that pH and species' upper depthlimit are the variables most strongly associated with geneticdiversity. Additionally, we find that the Caribbean Acroporapalmata has unexpectedly high genetic diversity, the highest ofany Acroporid species. These findings suggest that there isevidence for species-specific genetic diversity levels and thatabiotic factors and anthropogenic induced stressors mayinfluence the genetic diversity of the genus Acropora. Considering the importance of genetic diversity amongstpopulations, management strategies can utilize the informationof allelic diversity to generate an assessment of large-scaleecological change.Transit Agency Innovations and the COVID-19 Pandemic Kailey Flynn Sponsor: Susan Pike, Ph.D. Inst Of Transportation Studies Public health concerns caused by COVID-19 throughout 2020left transit agencies facing challenges such as decliningridership and increased costs. Though this pandemic hasaltered daily operations, there have also been increasedopportunities to implement technologies or policies such ascontactless payments or mobile ticketing. The aim of this studyis to understand the impact COVID-19 has had on the factorsthat impact agencies' pursuit of these types of innovations. Thisstudy uses survey data collected from transit agencies acrossthe United States. Respondents were asked about their pursuitof fare free service, contactless payment, on demand services,mobile phone based ticketing, and shared-use mobilitypartnerships. The survey also asked background questionsabout the transit agencies, such as fleet size, sources offunding, and geography (i.e. rural and urban). Our results so farsuggest that COVID-19 changed how agencies view thesedifferent innovations and that policy entrepreneurs have playeda large role in influencing their progress. We will also examinehow fleet size and geography, as well as attitudes towards theseinnovations impacted their implementation during the pandemic. Initial Attraction and Post-Pairing Affiliation in Titi Monkeys: A Preliminary Assessment Weng Ian Fok Sponsor: Karen Bales, Ph.D. Psychology In humans and other monogamous species, the development ofpair bonds follows a typical course of initiation, formation, andmaintenance. Although pair bonding has been studied in manyspecies, there is little research on mate choice in monogamousnon-human primate. We investigated initial attraction and pairbond outcomes in socially monogamous titi monkeys(Plecturocebus cupreus), an established model of human pairbonding. Our goals were (1) to identify the behavioralcharacteristics of initial attraction in titi monkeys and (2) toexplore the relationship between initial attraction andrelationship trajectories post-pairing. We hypothesized thatinitial attraction would predict affiliative behaviors after bonding.Subjects were 6 sexually-na\u00efve titi monkeys (3 males, 3females). Initial attraction was determined from a series ofround-robin \"speed dating\" experiments, in which each monkeyinteracted with each potential mate for 30 minutes. Thebehaviors scored included proximity to the potential mate andvocalizations. Based on proximity, monkeys were paired withtheir most attracted partner. We present preliminary resultsinvestigating whether vocalizations and proximity to thepotential mate are correlated, and whether these behaviorspredict affiliation with the partner they were paired with. Theseresults will provide evolutionary insights on the origins ofrelationship formation in humans.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 44Replication-Stress Induced Nucleophagy Suppresses Chromosome Damage During Mitosis Lauren Ford Sponsor: Kenneth Kaplan, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio Cell division is a highly regulated process that results in two daughter cells receiving identical copies of their parentgenome. Replication stress that delays genome duplication canslow sister giving rise to in anaphase. UFBs are linkages that join sisterchromatids and prevent segregation, leading to pathologicalchromosome nondisjunction and the formation of micronuclei(MN). It is proposed that autophagy suppresses this formation ofMN by targeting partially formed nuclei through nucleophagy.Our previous studies indicate that this pathway is regulated bythe Intra-S-Phase kinase cascade and is triggered byunreplicated DNA. Additionally, we found that the drughydroxyurea activates replication-stress induced nucleophagy(ReSIN) to ensure the proper resolution of sister chromatids.Thus, we hypothesize that the ReSIN pathway contributes to themaintenance of chromosome stability. To test this hypothesis,we will engineer cells with mutations in their nucleophagypathway and analyze their response to replication stressthrough the incidence of Rad52-GFP repair foci. We predict thatnucleophagy mutants will lead to an increase in the frequency ofcells with unresolved UFBs and DNA damage, as detected byRad52-GFP, supporting the idea that nucleophagy contributesto maintaining chromosome stability, especially after replicationstress. Derivation and Analysis of Time Dilation and Gravitational Redshifts of Star S0-2 Near the Galactic Central Supermassive Black Hole Tanya Freshour Sponsor: David Wittman, Ph.D. Physics Einstein's theory of relativity predicts that a star passing close toa supermassive black hole will exhibit shifts in wavelength ofemitted electromagnetic radiation (redshift). Special relativitypredicts redshift due to time redshift due to gravitation. The Newtonian modelaccounts for neither. The brevity of S0-2's close proximity toSagittarius-A*, the supermassive black hole central to the MilkyWay galaxy, allows isolation of those effects to one part of theorbit. The strong gravitational field near Sagittarius A* andvelocity of S0-2 provide a unique opportunity to test the validityand precision of Newtonian and relativistic models compared toobservational data. We use Taylor expansions to highlight thecontributions of gravitational redshift and time dilation.Newtonian model error is calculated using derived equationsand the Schwarzschild metric. A Newtonian model fits S0-2'sorbit well, except near the black hole, where we find excessredshifts equaling the predicted relativistic effects. This confirmsthe existence of time dilation and euryhalinespecies with the capacity to tolerate an exceptionally largerange of salinity. In this study, we test if the epigenetic responseof fish to salinity stress depends on previous exposure to thesame stress. Our experimental design includes 24 tilapia in 3groups that are exposed to 85 g/kg seawater for 0, 1, and 3times respectively. Handling controls are included in theexperimental design. We will increase salinity by 7.5 g/kg perday until 85 g/kg, then decrease to 0 g/kg, and repeat. Usingthe web camera, we will observe behaviors of fish and monitorwhether salinity changes alter behavior. We will also measurehepatosomatic and gonadosomatic index of fish and comparetheir weights and lengths after repeated exposure. We expectthat all tilapia will survive with no mortality as 85 g/kg has beenpreviously demonstrated to be well below their upper tolerancelimit of 120 g/kg. Moreover, we hypothesize that histone PTMstoichiometry will depend on the number of exposures tosalinity stress. Our experiment paves the way for futurecharacterization of the dynamics of osmoregulated histonePTMs in Mozambique tilapia. The QAnon Conspiracy Theory and Spiritual Warfare in Contemporary Christianity Stephen Fujimoto Sponsor: Allison Coudert, Ph.D. Religious Studies During the Donald Trump presidency, many of the president'ssupporters latched onto and disseminated the QAnonconspiracy theory which centers around a prophecy thatPresident Trump will take down a satanic pedophile ring ofDemocrat politicians and liberal elites. Along with helping toinspire offline violence like the insurrection at the United StatesCapitol in January 2021, the conspiracy theory has attracted a\"big tent\" of various groups, including conservative Christians. Iseek to answer why they would be attracted by presenting acase study of a QAnon-promoting Christian group, OmegaKingdom Ministry (OKM), using public recordings of weeklymeetings uploaded online by the ministry. A particular focus willbe placed on their teachings and practices around spiritualwarfare, many inspired by the larger New Apostolic Reformationmovement. These beliefs will also be traced back historically toAmerica's infancy when the Purtian desire to be a moralexample to the rest of the world was incorporated to the culturalfabric of this nation. Ultimately, I argue that OKM's views onspiritual warfare, a product of larger contemporary and historicalmovement, are very compatible with the QAnon conspiracytheory, explaining why the group spreads both QAnon andChristian beliefs simultaneously.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 45No Evidence of Inbreeding Depression on Height Within the Himba, Namibian Pastoralist Population Brenna Gallagher Sponsor: Brenna Henn, Ph.D. Anthropology Recent studies have shown inbreeding depression for height in European populations where a decrease in height is correlatedto an increase in homozygosity, expressed as FROH. Weattempt to identify this correlation within the Himba populationwho exhibit increased levels of inbreeding. The Himba are anendogamous Namibian pastoralist population that regularlyengage in fostering familial kin as a form of cooperativebreeding. To investigate the relationship between FROH andheight in this population, we use genotype, height and otherdemographic data from 309 adult Himba individuals. Weidentify runs of homozygosity (ROH) at 1500 KB threshold fromwhich FROH is calculated. Log-log linear regression models arecreated to predict height from FROH with covariates of sex, ageand fosterage. Fosterage was included based on the findings ofScelza and Prall (2014), who found reduced height to beassociated with fostered individuals. Contrary to previousfindings, we did not find a significant effect of FROH on heightin the Himba population, regardless of the inclusion of fosterageas a covariate. A relationship between height and FROH mayhave been undetectable due to our limited sample size, oranother environmental factor not accounted for. Development of a Reliable, Low-Cost Reaction Wheel for CubeSat Attitude Control Timothee Galmiche Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr This presentation discusses the development of a low-costManufactured Reaction Wheel (MRW) system for the REALOPmission, UC Davis's first and completely undergraduate-ledCubeSat mission.

This study investigates the relationship betweenan infant's access to information, in the form of motordevelopment, and their visual attention to objects with complexfeatures. Research has shown a robust link between infantexperience manipulating objects and their visual attention toobject properties. In the present study, 4-12-month-old infants(N = 100) were shown pairs of unfamiliar objects. One objectwas easily \"graspable\", with a handle-like region, specialized forgrasping, while the other was not. Additionally, parentscompleted a motor development questionnaire about theirinfant's motor abilities. All data were collected through theLookit online platform and coded with Datavyu software for theduration of looking at both objects. We hypothesize thatincreasingly complex motor capabilities, such as crawling orwalking will influence the features of objects that infants findmost interesting. Thus, an infant with motor ability that allows forobject obtainment and manipulation will show a visualpreference for objects with specialized features, such ashandles. Influence of Striga Infestation on Microbial Communities Colonizing Sorghum Roots Adrian Garcia Sponsor: Siobhan Brady, Ph.D. Plant Biology Sorghum is a key economic and nutritional cereal crop in Africa,but its production is currently threatened by the parasitic plant,Striga hermontica. Currently available methods to control theparasite, are either not available for smallholder farmers, noteasily integrated into agricultural practices and have lowefficiency. A microbiome-based solution can be an affordableand easy alterative way to reduce Striga infection. Producing aneffective microbial product, requires a better understanding ofhow Striga infestation affects the recruitment of soil microbiome.We characterized the root microbiome composition in theStriga-susceptible genotype, Shanqui Red, and Striga-resistantgenotype, SRN-39 in the presence and the absence of Striga.Each variety was grown in Striga-suppressive soil and infectedwith Striga. Microbial composition was profiled over the courseof two sorghum developmental stages from the threemicrobiome compartments: bulk soil, rhizosphere (soil attachedto sorghum roots), and endophyte (inside the sorghum roots).Collected data suggest that Striga infection effect differs acrossthe compartments. Further research will explore how theobserved variation affects the suppressive properties of the soil. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 46Technical Development and Assembly of a Modular Cubesat Jorge Garcia Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The REALOP CubeSat of the University of California, Davis team utilizes a new design that is modular and provides more accessto internal payload components. To achieve ease ofaccessibility and modularity, the structures team designedmounting brackets and a unique printed circuit board (PCB)housing unit that are easy to modify and reorganize withouthaving to take apart the whole satellite assembly. The assemblypreparation team is currently working towards a standardizedintegration plan that carefully documents the process ofassembling each payload component. A database of well-organized and detailed documents was made to tackle themultiple challenges in developing an assembly procedure thatindependently integrated each of the critical payloadcomponents, PCBs, and wire routes with the structural frame.The assembly will consist of installing deployment switches,payload components and their respective mounting brackets, X-faces, Y-faces, Z-faces, and finally solar panels. These newdesigns and standardized integration documents will be usedfor future CubeSat missions and testing. Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms as Predictors of Shyness Juan Garcia-Cardenas Sponsor: Richard Robins, Ph.D. Psychology Shyness, or the tendency to feel awkward, worried, or tenseduring social encounters, especially with unfamiliar people, is ahighly prevalent personality trait. Although shyness is a widelystudied research topic, more research is needed on how anxietyand depression symptoms influence the development ofshyness during adolescence. The present study will testwhether symptoms of anxiety and depression at age 10 predictthe developmental trajectory of shyness from age 10 to 16. Wewill use data from the California Families Project, a longitudinalstudy of 674 Mexican origin youth. In particular, we will examineshyness assessed via the Early Adolescent TemperamentQuestionnaire and symptoms of anxiety and depressionassessed via the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule forChildren-IV. We predict that the presence of anxiety anddepressive symptoms at age 10 will be associated withincreases in shyness from age 10 to 16. To test this, we willmodel a latent growth curve for shyness from age 10 to 16 andinclude symptoms of anxiety and depression at age 10 as time-invariant predictors of the intercept and slope of the trajectory.Celebrating D\u00eda de los Muertos: Healing and Garza Sponsor: Susy Zepeda, Ph.D. Chicano Studies Death is a part of life that is inevitable. People process andunderstand the concept of death differently. Chicanxparticipation in D\u00eda de los Muertos offers them an alternativeperspective and way to grieve and celebrate the cycles of lifeand death. A celebration full of traditions that has survivedcolonization and a global pandemic serves as a day ofremembrance for those no longer with us. How does D\u00eda de losMuertos create a space for grieving and healing? In this study, Iwill specifically be looking at Taller Arte del Nuevo Amanecer(TANA) annual D\u00eda de los Muertos event to better understandhow art plays a role in grieving. An event that incorporatessilkscreen prints, altars, and danza. Community members fromaround the area gather to honor their loved ones. This study willuse photographs from the event, interviews with the organizers,and autohistoria-teor\u00eda to explore how a space for collectiveand individual healing is possible. The artwork created for thisevent will also be analyzed to map the possibilities of using artas a tool for grieving and healing. We Journeyed Together - An Online Tabletop Role- playing Game Jackson Gaydon Sponsor: Joshua Mccoy, Ph.D. Engr Computer Science The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the tabletop role-playinggame community to adapt to virtual settings, often using voicechat and virtual tabletops. However, these games were notdesigned to be played online, causing the new format to beawkward. This causes challenges to new players who strugglewith joining the hobby due to current games either focusingheavily on the rules and leaving storytelling as secondary, orbeing rules-light and not having game masters to moderate andensure the game has an existing structure to follow. This hasmotivated development of this online tabletop role-playinggame, that provides the experience of traveling with a group ofpeople on an adventure to confront a great threat over only afew hours. It follows similar role-playing formats to Fiasco andWeave, but provides a rules-light but rigid structure of play sothat it is easier to have an ideal experience. The game designphilosophy ensures that any features must be simple tounderstand and use, leading me to hope that it will fill thecurrent gap in internet-focused, accessible games, which wewill be measuring the success of by playtesting over these nextfew months.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 47A Patient-Facing Intervention for Weight-Neutral Care: Diet Culture Office Star Ghanaat Sponsor: Mona Monfared, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio The purpose of this patient-facing guidebook is to increase patient familiarity with the biological and social frameworksassociated with obesity spread awareness about the importanceof challenging diet culture, and inform patients of weight-neutralapproaches to obesity, especially within the Sacramento area.While current clinical practice centers weight loss in treatingobesity, weight-neutral approaches have a smaller body ofscholarship. This guidebook will explain how prioritizingbiomarkers, mental health, and nutrition can lead to equal orbetter outcomes for patients with obesity. This guidebook usesscientific review articles and individual studies from the past fiveyears in the United States and in Europe to discuss topics likeweight bias, causes and effects of obesity, and effectiveness ofweight-neutral compared to weight loss-centered approaches.Additional research needs to be conducted to confirm specificfindings, such as self-compassion-based approaches improvingnutrition behaviors and body image, and to expand on morebiochemical and genetic mechanisms behind obesity. Thisguidebook should be distributed to mental health clinics,medical centers, and dietitian offices to increase patientawareness about obesity and weight-neutral approaches, anddistributing this guidebook to medical centers and nutritiondepartments within medical schools will also increase providerawareness of weight-neutral approaches to obesity. UBE3A Transcript and Protein Levels in a Novel Mouse Model for 15q11.2-q13.3 Duplication Syndrome Julia Godinez Sponsor: Janine Lasalle, Ph.D. & Imm Dup15q11-13 syndrome is a neuro-developmental disordercharacterized by intellectual disability, autism, developmentaldelay, hypotonia, epilepsy, and dysmorphic facial features. Dup15q results from a maternally inherited duplication of the 15q11.2-q13.3 region of the human chromosome 15 containing the geneUBE3A . UBE3A is thought to play a role in the development of Dup15q. Therefore, my hypothesis is that mice bearing an extracopy of the Ube3a gene will over-express UBE3A phenotypes. The LaSalle lab has generateda Dup15q mouse model by inserting an extra copy of Ube3a intothe mouse genome using the PiggyBac-on-BAC method. qRT-PCR analysis of Ube3a transgenic mouse brain found thatUbe3a transcripts are lower than control littermates. Westernblot analysis of mouse brain samples found that UBEA wassignificantly reduced in Ube3a transgenic mice compared tocontrols. Therefore, the data was counter to my hypothesis thattransgenic mice would show increased levels of UBE3A proteincompared to their controls. Additional studies will be necessaryin order to confirm these findings in Ube3a transgenic mice.This novel Ube3a mouse model may or may not be a useful toolto further understand the role of UBE3A in Dup15q syndromeand to develop effective treatments. LupSeat: An Generator Hiroya Gojo Sponsor: Joel Porquet, Ph.D. Engr Computer Science When students are allowed to sit next to whoever they want inan exam, it may increase the chance of plagiarism and cheating.On the other hand, assigning random seats to students prior toexams is time-consuming, especially for large classes, sinceinstructors have to assign seats by hand. There are also risks ofclerical errors, such as forgetting to assign a student. Existingsoftware solutions focus on relatively small classrooms. Thegoal of LupSeat is to automate the seat assignment process inan easy way to solve this problem. Using an algorithmicapproach simplifies the process of spacing out students andminimizes the chance of errors. Different types of algorithmswere developed to compare its effectiveness to create aseating layout with the least amount of students sitting together.LupSeat also accounts for other factors such as special needsseats or left-handed vs. right-handed seats. LupSeat is easy forinstructors to use and instructors only need to provide studentinformation and the representation of the room layout. Theoutput visualization is very customizable, giving instructors thefreedom to format the output how they want it. Anogenital Distance as a Biomarker for Prenatal Sex Hormone Exposure in Titi Monkeys Carmella Gomez Sponsor: Karen Bales, Ph.D. Psychology Prenatal androgen exposure (PAE) influences physiologicaldevelopment, giving sexually-dimorphic biomarkers,including anogenital distance (AGD) and second-to-fourth digit(2D:4D) ratio. However, there are still many questionsconcerning when and how prenatal sex hormones affect thesebiomarkers, and few studies have attempted to correlatebiomarkers, particularly in animal models. The purpose of thisstudy was to assess AGD in titi monkeys (Plecturocebuscupreus), a promising nonhuman primate model for humandevelopment. We hypothesized (1) that AGD would be sexuallydimorphic; (2) AGD AGD would correlate with circulating maternal sexhormones during pregnancy (determined from urine samples).Subjects were 74 adult titi monkeys (40 males, 34 females).AGD and 2D:4D ratio were measured using standardconventions while subjects were sedated for routine healthexaminations. For 24 subjects, maternal testosterone andestrone-1C-conjugate were assayed from archived urinesamples obtained during the first trimester of pregnancy. Dataanalysis is in progress and will be completed using t-tests andmultiple regression. The results of this study will haveimplications for how biomarkers of PAE are interpreted in futurestudies.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 48Inhibition of Glycolysis to Promote Tendon Formation Nicole Gonzales Sponsor: Michael Mienaltowski, D.V.M.,Ph.D. Animal Science Proper tendon healing can be the difference between an active horse and a debilitated horse. Advancements in repairstrategies are required to improve tendon healing in injured horses. Recently, 2-deoxy-d-glucose was determined to be apotent stimulant for the tenogenesis of human stem cells inculture. In this study, we are examining the effect of 2-deoxy-d-glucose on tenogenic properties of stem/progenitor cellsderived from the digital flexor tendon. We hypothesize that 2-deoxy-d-glucose will lead to an inhibition of glycolysis which will bolstertendon formation in the progenitor cells. In order to test this, wehave provided cells with 0, 10, 100, and 1000 ?M of 2-deoxy-d-glucose over a 48-hour period in monolayer culture. We areusing real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to assaygene expression in response to the glycolysis inhibitor.Concentrations of the glycolysis inhibitor that optimally promotetenogenesis will be further investigated in a three-dimensionaltendon construct model before consideration of its applicationas an equine tendon repair therapeutic. The Aurora B Kinase Regulates ESCRT-III Machinery in Replication Stress Induced Nucleophagy Joseph Gonzales Sponsor: Kenneth Kaplan, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio Proper sister-chromatid resolution during anaphase is critical tomaintain chromosome stability, and defects can result inmicronuclei that contribute to further chromosome instability.The Kaplan lab has characterized a pathway known as ReSIN(replication stress induced nucleophagy), which we proposesuppresses the formation of micronuclei by targeting them fordegradation in lysosomes. What pathways regulate ReSINremain unknown. The Aurora B kinase is known to regulatemultiple events in anaphase, including the activity of the ESCRT-III, a complex important for abscission or more generally thesealing of double membranes organelles kinase regulates nucleophagy through ESCRT-IIImembrane closure events in the presence of unresolved sisterchromatids induced by replication stress. To test this, we willinduce replication stress with hydroxyurea and chemically inhibitan analogue sensitive allele of the Aurora B kinase in buddingyeast and measure ESCRT-III localization. We predict that theAurora B kinase is required to regulate ESCRT-III, preventinglocalization at phagophore assembly sites and the trafficking ofcargo important for nucleophagy into the vacuole, resulting inthe accumulation of vesicular intermediates.Environmental Burden and Incarceration at a Crossroads: A Quantitative Analysis of Incarceration Rates and Environmental Quality in the State of Georgia Braulio Gonzalez Sponsor: Clare Cannon, Ph.D. Human Ecology Intersectional environmental and incarceration justice data tools(ex. VERA, EJ SCREEN) highlight the intersection of these issueswith economic and social indicators. We seek to understand therelationship between countywide incarceration rates andenvironmental quality using Georgia counties as a case study.Georgia state suffers from disproportionally high levels ofincarceration nationwide (PPI). Using data from the VERAInstitute of Justice (2014) and the US Environmental ProtectionAgency Environmental Quality Index (2013), we employedbivariate correlation and OLS regression to analyze theassociation between county incarceration rate andenvironmental quality compared to individual-levelsociodemographic, behavioral, and socioeconomiccharacteristics. We found that environmental quality was mostassociated with incarceration rate (95% Confidence Interval [CI]=Beta .47), while all other variables also had a significantrelationship. Among Georgia counties for which there are data(n = 157), the association between county incarceration rate andenvironmental quality (determined by US EPA environmentalquality index) may be explained by existing sociodemographicdisparities and complex environmental justice issues.Policymakers should consider the intersection betweenincarceration and the environment when shaping incarcerationand environmental policy. Future research should include aqualitative analysis of communities at the intersection ofincarceration and environment quality. Post Covid19 Air New Zealand Marketing Plan Eva Goodisson Sponsor: Douglas Findlay, M.B.A. Graduate School Of Management Covid19 has served as a strategic inflection point to change thelandscape of the airline industry and who the dominant playersare. Air New Zealand is a premium airline with an opportunity tobecome passengers first choice when flying. The change ineconomy, consumer behaviour, airline operations and marketshare pre and post covid have been analysed to determine howAir New Zealand can uniquely position themselves as apremium airline that will sustain a competitive advantage overother airlines. I have researched the 'secret sauce' for whatmakes premium airlines successful today, and whatdifferentiation possibilities covid19 has given us that Air NewZealand can leverage moving forward. We now exist in a stateof post pandemic opportunity - a position that is exciting anduncertain. There is hesitation to travel yet eagerness, and theimplications of my marketing plan will reflect the change inairline operations, market share and traveller priorities postcovid19, through leveraging the benchmark of responsibility andleadership in New Zealand and the excitement of travel.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 49Prehistoric Hafting in South Africa Brian Graves Sponsor: Teresa Steele, Ph.D. Anthropology During Africa's Middle Stone Age (MSA), the archaeological record reveals a significant increase inbehavioral variability, including early personal ornaments andart. Excavations in South Africa have found at least 23 MSA siteswith rich concentrations of ochre, quarried elsewhere and oftenimported. Ethnographic accounts and replication studies havedemonstrated that this substance was likely used as a loadingagent for adhesives crafted using Acacia resin. Thearchaeological record has preserved this mineral in conjunctionwith many lithic points, some bearing the traces of plant resinsindicative of hafting. Experimental archaeology is required tolink these materials to their potential use with hafted spears. Didblunting or backing of stone points increase the efficacy ofadhesives? Were firing or drying conditions carefully controlledduring adhesive manufacture or application? Did gains indurability make complicated construction worthwhile or couldpeople fashion these implements in a time-efficient manner?Lacking firsthand accounts, experimental archaeology affordsresearchers a means to simulate the creation of adhesives. Thisproject provides a detailed literature review of the ethnographicand archaeological record for adhesive manufacturing and useand proposes an experimental design to investigate theenergetic trade-offs of production. Disparities in breastfeeding initiation and continuation among women with substance use during pregnancy Kathleen Groh Sponsor: Laura Kair, M.D. MED: Pediatrics Breastfeeding is critically important for maternal and infanthealth across the life course. Prenatal tobacco and illicitsubstance exposure increase offspring risk for sudden infantdeath syndrome (SIDS), while breastfeeding decreases SIDSrisk. However, clinical practice guidelines offer conflictingrecommendations about breastfeeding for women withsubstance use. This study of 2016-2018 CDC Pregnancy RiskAssessment Monitoring System data determined the extent towhich women who report tobacco and/or illicit substance useduring pregnancy initiate breastfeeding and continue for at least6 weeks compared to women without these exposures. Usingweighted Rao-Scott chi-square tests, we examined theassociation of substance use with breastfeeding initiation andcontinuation. Data from states that collected information onperinatal substance use, breastfeeding initiation, andbreastfeeding continuation was used. Weighted, multivariablelogistic regression was used to estimate the odds ofbreastfeeding initiation and continuation for women with andwithout prenatal substance use while adjusting for relevantcharacteristics. We found women with prenatal smoking andsubstance use are less likely to initiate breastfeeding andcontinue breastfeeding. Similarly, women who initiatedbreastfeeding and used illicit substances were also less likely tocontinue breastfeeding. These results underscore the need forinterventions to boost breastfeeding in this vulnerable group. Experimental Assessment of a Novel Fixative for Ichthyological Applications Allison Grygar Sponsor: Levi Lewis, Ph.D. Wildlife & Fisheries Biology Excell Plus is an emerging glyoxal-based fixative that serves asa less toxic alternative to formaldehyde for preserving biologicaltissues for histology and genomics. Though tested in theseareas, its preservation of whole organisms and calcifiedstructures (e.g., fish otoliths) for ichthyological studies remainspoorly described. We examined differences in the preservationquality of whole Delta Smelt, an endangered native Californiafish, and their otoliths that were preserved in Excell Plus, liquidnitrogen, 95% ethanol, or 10% formalin for one week and onemonth. For whole fish, we contrasted preservation-basedchanges in length, mass, body depth, color, and eye diameter.For otoliths, we examined effects on size, structural integrity,microstructure quality, and elemental signatures. If Excell Pluspreserves specimens in comparable or improved conditionrelative to other preservatives, it could be considered apreferred alternative that reduces hazards while maximizingspecimen preservation for multiple uses. However, if Excell Pluspreserves otoliths or whole specimens in worse condition thanother preservatives, it may only be valuable for specificapplications. This study contributes new information to informand improve upon standard field and laboratory protocols inichthyology. Using Social Disorganization Theory to Understand Police-Community Interaction in a Multi-Ethnic City: A Quantitative Study on Police Behavior in San Diego Sheridamae Gudez Sponsor: William Mccarthy, Ph.D. Sociology Recent expansions of social disorganization theory focus onminority communities, highlighting that racial segregation islinked to crime. The existing literature fails to expand on therelationship between non-Black communities, policing, andcrime. This study adds to this literature by analyzing San Diego,a diverse community, and assessing if similar relationshipsbetween different communities, policing, and crime exist. Thisstudy asks: 1) Do communities in San Diego City that experiencevarious forms of social disorganization have a greater policepresence? 2) Do communities with large minority populationsexperience more engagement with law enforcement thancommunities that have larger white populations? In this study Iamassed, cleaned, and analyzed 21,138 police reports matchedto census tracts within San Diego. I estimated negative binomialregression models predicting police reports to analyze therelationships between community characteristics and policebehavior. Results indicate that communities with greaterpercentages foreign-born populations, divorced, or lowhomeownership are linked to more police reports. Whilecommunities with large Asian or Hispanic populations, highmedian income, or high homeownership are linked to lowerpolice reports. This study suggests a need for communityenriching programs, and a deeper analysis between lawenforcement interactions and immigrant communities in multi-ethnic cities.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 50Linking the Foraging and Breeding Behaviors in Lekking Species Alexa Guerrero Sponsor: Eric Tymstra, Ph.D. Microbiology & Molec Genetics It's well established that breeding and foraging behaviors depend on individual decisions, but little is known about howdecisions are connected across contexts. To improveconservation efforts of wild species and critical habitat, it'sessential to understand how animal decisions of foraging andbreeding are linked. The current research focuses on breedingbehavior in the Greater sage-grouse, a lekking bird that feedsexclusively on chemically-defended sagebrush during thebreeding season. Male sage-grouse display for several hourseach morning on a lek (display ground) during the breedingseason and forage on toxic sagebrush in the afternoons. We willbe connecting the individual decisions on and off-lek and howthey influence off-lek foraging behavior to the on-lek breedingbehavior, which are essential to male survival and reproductivesuccess that incur high physiological costs. Using videos takenon leks during the breeding season, I will quantify malebreeding behavior by recording successful copulations,aggression display rates, and male-male aggressive interactions.This breeding behavior data will be paired with chemicalforaging data collected from GPS-tagged males. Linkingforaging and breeding behaviors in sage-grouse will allowresearchers and managers to understand how habitat qualityaffects reproductive success and, more broadly, populationprocesses in other herbivores. Water Shortages, Lithium Mining, and the Indigenous Community in San Pedro de Atacama: The Impact of Profit Maximizing Behavior on Atacame\u00f1o Tradition XANDER GULDMAN Sponsor: Jonathan London, Ph.D. Human Ecology To many, electric vehicles symbolize an important step towardan environmentally sustainable future. The lithium used in EVbatteries, however, carries a heavy social and environmentalcost. The water intensive process by which lithium is mined hasrapidly depleted the water table in Chile's Atacama desert,which is home to the most extensive lithium reserves in theworld as well as the indigenous Atacame\u00f1o people. This paperseeks to understand the impact that lithium extraction has onthe Atacama's indigenous population, and how water ismanaged in this fragile ecosystem. Semi-structured interviewswere conducted with individuals from indigenous andenvironmental advocacy groups in the Atacama to shed light onthe above topics. This paper was also informed by existingliterature addressing the impacts of lithium mining on theAtacame\u00f1o community. Preliminary findings emphasize thatwater shortages have compromised the Atacame\u00f1ocommunity's ability to engage in traditional subsistenceagriculture and is causing irreversible cultural damage to thisindigenous community. Economic motivations at the state andcorporate levels guide how water is managed and distributed inthe interests of national and global capital in ways that interferewith local health and livelihoods.Integration of Theory, Experiments and Computer Simulations for Dynamics and Vibration Problems Naijing Guo Sponsor: Mohamed Hafez, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr As computers are becoming more and more accessible and powerful, they have become an essential tool especially forSTEM fields - a large number of science experiments andengineering projects can be simulated by computers. In thesame vein, fundamental theories in science and engineering canalso be readily simulated and illustrated using simplemathematical models, and thus become more intelligible tostudents. Along with computer simulation, hand-on experimentis another way to make theories more comprehensible tostudents. In this special circumstance of the pandemic, however,traditional experiments in the science lab setting are notavailable to students anymore, making the designing of simplehome experiments much needed. This project focuses on thecomputer simulation and home experiment methods on thefollowing topics: solving initial value problems for ordinarydifferential equations, numerical evaluation of exponentialfunction and numerical evaluation of trigonometric function. Ineach of the problem category, we will investigate one or morephysical problem scenarios - in particular, we will study theoscillations of Yoyo and the pendulum problem with and withoutdamping effects, find their mathematical descriptions andanalytical solutions, and present our computer simulations andhome experiments methods and results. Development of a Reliable, Low-Cost Reaction Wheel for CubeSat Attitude Control Anjali Gupta Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr This presentation discusses the development of a low-costManufactured Reaction Wheel (MRW) system for the REALOPmission, UC Davis's first and completely undergraduate-ledCubeSat mission. Commercial reaction wheel systems typicallyexceed budgets for university missions, so the motor andreaction wheels are independently acquired and joined with athermal-press fit to ensure cost-effectiveness and reliability.Once in orbit, the MRW will autonomously stabilize and preciselyorient the CubeSat so that the satellite's visible light andinfrared cameras can take clear photos. The MRW controlsystems team is developing a methodology to find a PIDcontroller which meets the mission requirements. This processbegins with finding a model of the system, applying and tuningthe controller, then verifying results with physical testing. Ageneral approach allows for testing on low-cost motors, inpreparation for quick and safe tuning of the assembled MRW.Many university CubeSat missions are hindered by the expenseof reaction wheel systems; successful use and thoroughdocumentation of REALOP's Manufactured Reaction Wheelsystem will provide future missions with easier access to low-cost, reliable reaction wheel systems.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 51The Effects of Social Exclusion and Familism on Prosocial Behaviors in Mexican-Origin Adolescents Ritika Gupta Sponsor: Paul Hastings, Ph.D. Psychology Social exclusion has detrimental effects on development by threatening psychological needs (e.g., belonging, self-esteem).However, familism (i.e., the prioritization of the family unit) hasbeen found to buffer against these detrimental effects in Latinxyouth, and even promote positive social adjustment behaviors,such as prosocial behaviors, which are actions intended tobenefit others. However, these assessments have been limitedto self-report assessments. Autonomic nervous system (ANS)reactivity is regarded as a biomarker for emotion regulation andmay reveal underlying effects of how social exclusion impactsyouth. In this study, familism was examined as a moderatorbetween adolescent ANS reactivity to social exclusion andprosocial behaviors. 229 Mexican-origin adolescents (113females, mean age = 17.16 years, SDage = .41) were recruited to participate in the study. ANS reactivity during social exclusiondid not significantly predict prosocial behavior engagement.However, familism significantly and positively predictedengagement prosocial behaviors (\u00df = .27, p < .001). Familism didnot significantly moderate the association between ANSreactivity during social exclusion and prosocial behaviors.Therefore, familism may be an effective way of promotingprosocial behaviors in Mexican-origin adolescents. Thesefindings suggest that familism may in fact not effectively bufferagainst physiological responses to social exclusion. Why it is important to protect Wastewater Essential Workers during COVID-19 Jessica Ha Sponsor: Maureen Kinyua, Ph.D. Civil & Environmental Engr In this COVID-19 pandemic, essential workers have beenbrought to our attention and magnified the importance toprotect them. Among those, wastewater personnels are a moresusceptible group to pathogen exposure. In other words, groupsthat are at high risk of viruses such as COVID-19. As such, it isimportant to determine their risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2when providing essential service to the public. Therefore, weconducted a national survey of wastewater treatmentpersonnels to gather information about their access and use ofPPE and determine other health indicators that may affect theirsusceptibility to wastewater pathogens. With 243 surveyresponses, results illustrated that over 34% of workers aredirectly exposed to wastewater half of the time at work. In thefuture, we will conduct a quantitative microbial risk assessmentwith information gathered from this national survey to determinethe occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewatertreatment plant. We hope the result of this survey can elucidatethe current situation in wastewater treatment plants and providevaluable information for industry and public health officials onhow to be prepared for pathogens that are transmittablethrough wastewater.American Politicians of Middle Eastern Descent: Examining Voter Assessment of Competence Sabrina Habchi Sponsor: James Adams, Ph.D. Political Science Middle Easterners in the U.S. are often referred to as America'sinvisible minority, since they are marked by the U.S. Census asCaucasian, but often do not benefit the same way as those ofEuropean descent. In fact, despite the complexities of MiddleEasterners' ethnic and racial compositions, individuals within thisracial group are often characterized as Muslim even when thismay not necessarily be the case, which may further affect howMiddle Easterners in the U.S. are treated given the present day'shostile political climate towards Muslims. This study will examinewhether women of Middle Eastern descent who run for politicaloffice in the U.S. are appraised differently by voters in terms ofcompetence than white women and men who run for office.This will be assessed by presenting participants withhypothetical candidates, including a small statement andpicture, of either a white man, white woman or Middle Easternwoman and assessing their responses in regards to believedcompetency and willingness to vote for this candidate.Participants in each condition will be given the exact sameinformation about the candidate, with only the name, sex andracial background manipulated. What Makes a Successful Legislator in the California Legislature Alisha Hacker Sponsor: Scott Mackenzie, Ph.D. Political Science The California State Legislature is one of the most influentialpolicy chambers in the country. California has 40 million citizensand is the 6th largest economy, which makes the decisionsmade in Sacramento very important. Being an effectivelegislature in the California State Legislature can allow amember to pass significant and influential legislation. This paperdefines what qualities the most effective legislators in CaliforniaState Legislature possessed during different times in the lastdecade since the passage of term limit rules which led to a newgeneration of legislators in California after 2012. This researchcreates a profile of qualities that a successful legislatorpossesses by analyzing which legislators passed the most andthe least bills. Then, this project determines which characteristiclegislators performed above average mutually possessed. Thecharacteristics were members with law degrees, women, whohave served above-average years in the legislature, orDemocrats to test if they had a legislative advantage.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 52Investigating the Role of SEMA3C in Pacreatic Ductal Sponsor: Changil Hwang, D.V.M.,Ph.D. Microbiology & Molec Genetics The five year survival rate of pancreatic cancer is 10%, the lowest among the most common cancer types. While 95% ofpancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) carry mutations the KRAS protein directly has provendifficult. Instead, researchers are trying to target proteinsdownstream of KRAS for therapeutic benefit. Previous studiessuggest that KRAS mutated cancers are more likely to be relianton autophagy, a survival mechanism where cells recycle theirunnecessary cellular components for energy. I hypothesize thatthis process may be targetable for treatment of PDAC and aimto identify potential drug targets. Using existing single cell RNAsequencing data from PDAC patients, I found that SEMA3C, agene associated with a specific mutation of KRAS, is primarilyexpressed in pancreatic tumor cells and fibroblasts, and isupregulated in tumor cells compared to normal cells.Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis showed thatSEMA3C positive cells are enriched for the autophagy genesignature, suggesting that the SEMA3C protein is involved inthe regulation of autophagy in PDAC and is a potential target fortreatment. The Effects of Taxonomic and Thematic Related Objects on Visual Perception Fayann Han Sponsor: Joy Geng, Ph.D. Psychology We naturally learn that all objects that we interact with areassociated with one another. Some objects we learn toassociate with each other based on repeated visual experiences(e.g., a helmet is usually worn when on a bike; thematicinformation). Other objects, we learn to associate based onphysical and non-physical similarities (e.g., dogs, and whales areboth warm-blooded and give birth and hence mammals;taxonomic information). An important distinction between thesetwo types of information is how it is acquired. Given thisdichotomy, it is critical to understand if the source of learnedassociations between objects has a direct influence on how weperceive them. Through three behavioral experiments, weprovide evidence that learned visual co-occurrence ofthematically related objects result in faster perceptual groupingcompared to taxonomically related objects. Overall, theseresults demonstrate that learned co-occurrence (thematicrelationships) contribute to our semantic knowledge and alsoinfluence low level visual processing, illustrating a link betweenhow information is learned and how it regulates visualperception.A Comparison Between the Gut Microbiome Composition of the Carpenter Bee Species Xylocopa The gut microbiota of bees has been shown to play a role innutrition, immunity, and host fitness, making microbiome studiesincreasingly significant to our understanding of these importantpollinators. Differences in the microbiome composition betweensocial and solitary bees have pointed to social transmission as akey aspect in the maintenance of a functional microbiome. I aimto explore what roles host species, sociality, and environmentplay in gut microbiome composition by comparing two carpenter bee species: Xylocopa sonorinaand Xylocopa tabaniformis. Carpenter bees are consideredsolitary; however, X. sonorina has been seen to exhibit semi-social behavior which provides an opportunity to see how semi-social behavior influences the microbiome. Samples for bothspecies were collected from Davis, CA along with samples of X.sonorina collected in Tempe, Arizona and X. tabaniformiscollected at Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in California.Preliminary results for samples from Davis, CA suggest that X.sonorina and X. tabaniformis differ in the bacterial compositionin the gut, though both are heavily dominated by the genusLactobacillus. Further analysis will examine how host speciesand geographic location interact to form the gut microbiome inthese two bees. A Qualitative Analysis of Black Educators' Perspectives on Black Childrens' Need For School Success Minhal Hanif Sponsor: Faheemah Mustafaa, Education A variety of factors influence children's academic achievement.This qualitative study explores the diversity of perspectivespresent amongst Black educators regarding what they believeBlack students need to be successful in school. A group of 238K-12 educators who self-identified as Black or African American,across the U.S. plus Washington D.C., were asked to respond toan open-ended question within a larger survey study: \"What doAfrican American/Black children need in order to be successfulin school today? Please explain.\" We conducted a thematicopen coding analysis of the responses. Our analysis showedoverarching themes of social, institutional, and emotionalsupport as key factors that play a role in the academic successof Black students. The responses to this open-ended questionhave helped to illuminate the kinds of support that Blackeducators believe Black students need to be successful inschool today. The findings of this study may be utilized toinform educators, policymakers, parents, and others in futuredecision-making around children's academic pathways, laws,and policies in a way that takes into consideration theirintersectional identities and backgrounds.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 53Virus-based immunosorbent nanoparticles to purify antibodies from proteins Olivia Hart Sponsor: Karen Mcdonald, Ph.D. Chemical Engineering Viral nanotechnology is becoming more popular in biomedicine and materials science for its numerous potential applications,one of which is pharmaceutical protein purification. Plant virus-based immunosorbent nanoparticles (VIN) display proteins on itssurface capable of binding to antibodies or Fc-fusion proteinpharmaceuticals. VINs are being researched to serve as acomponent of a pharmaceutical purification scheme for limitedresource environments, addressing the need to overcome thecost and complexity of current manufacturing solutions. Plantviruses are a particularly appealing nanomaterial base becauseof the simple production in plants and inherent biosafety as non-infectious to humans.The concept of using VINs to captureantibodies has already been established. Here we describe ourwork to expand the utility of this promising virus-basednanomaterial by developing a new method wherein the VINsare used to capture arbitrary proteins via antibodyintermediates. We specifically emphasize development ofdissociation and separation mechanisms to capture the arbitraryprotein from the antibody and VIN. Identification of Potential Osmoregulatory an important worldwide aquaculture speciesas they have fast growth and a high environmental stresstolerance. Stressful environments present themselves asvariability among temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, etc. Inthe context of climate change, it is increasingly necessary tostudy species responses to stress in order to predict andmitigate potential effects on species diversity and biologicalperformance. One compensation mechanism during salinitystress involves the adjustment of regulation of the expression ofosmoregulatory genes. In this study we have identified 21 genesthat are induced by salinity stress in tilapia. We show thatsalinity induction is mediated by transcriptional regulation andhypothesize that regulation of 21 genes is due to a commonosmotically inducible enhancer element in their 5' regulatoryregion. Using the bioinformatics tool MEME-Suite, these 21sequences were analyzed to find motifs that represent bindingsites for salinity-inducible transcription factors. This studyidentified two motifs and two corresponding transcription factorsthat are common to all 21 sequences. Our findings pave the wayfor future experimental validation of biological activity for thesemotifs using reporter assays such as Luciferase or GFPreporters.Governance in Economic Recovery Zhengqian He Sponsor: Giovanni Peri, Ph.D. Economics Watching different responses to the economic fallout fromCOVID-19, I wondered how big a role institutional quality canplay in economic recovery since countries with bettergovernance failed to contain the negative economic influencethis time. Therefore, I researched on correlation betweengovernance and recovery levels, specifically in two era, AsianFinancial Crisis and the Great Recession. I utilized data on sixgovernance variables from the Worldwide Governance Indicatorand generated a dependent variable of efficiency of recoveryusing the summation of output gap in 3/5/7 years following acrisis. I have treated the data as a short two-episode panel andtwo cross-sectionals, and formed regression based on OLS andFixed Effects. The ultimate goal is to check if any institutionalquality factors play a significant role in economic recovery.Current results have shown a positive correlation betweenVoice and Accountability and recovery, but a negativecorrelation for Rule of Law. Also, the effect is more salient forthe Asian Financial Crisis than the Great Recession. Comparison of Machine Learning Models for Image Classification Sameerah Helal Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The purpose of this project is to teach UC Davis's first CubeSatwhen to collect pictures and IR sensor data. The Space andSatellite Systems (SSS) Club has developed a CubeSat that laysthe foundation for low-cost missions focused on Earth Science.This mission objective relies heavily on the problem of when tocollect data and ensuring the quality of our data. This isaccomplished through machine learning and information theoryand processing by the Computer Systems Team of SSS. Afterdedicated research from the Computer Systems/MachineLearning subteam, we have compared and contrasted threemethods for teaching our CubeSat: Linear Regression, LogisticRegression, and Support Vector Machine. Our results wereverified with mathematical optimization. We are developing anovel data set, which is highly sought after in Machine Learningresearch, to further test our methods. Future work will include anovel method that will not only teach the machine but allow it toactively learn at low cost to our power systems.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 54Heng is Cambodian for Luck: How my Father Escaped The Cambodian Genocide Jarod Heng Sponsor: Andrew Smith, M.A. Cinema & Digital Media I am the child of two immigrants from Southeast Asia. My father and his family escaped the Cambodian Genocide, and I grew uphearing the stories. However, throughout all my years in theAmerican education system, recent history, especiallysurrounding the Cold War in Southeast Asia and the lives ituprooted, barely seemed to get a passing mention. Combininghistorical research, personal interviews, and my own knowledge,I created a short narrative documentary of how my father'sfamily escaped the Cambodian Genocide and came to America,accompanied by a historical prelude. When the Khmer Rougeunder Pol Pot defeated the Cambodian monarch andgovernment forces, they began a long campaign to create anationalist agrarian communist \"utopia\" by murdering anddisplacing millions. In the chaos, my father's family, alongsidethe rest of the urban populace, were forced to march to thecountryside and jungles to resettle. From their small drug storein a Cambodian, to the perilous jungles of Cambodia, thedocumentary details my father and his family's memories of howthey escaped the Cambodian Genocide, and eventually came tosettle in the United States. Examining the Co-development of Shyness and Acculturation Across Mexican-Origin Youth: A longitudinal Study Isidro Hernandez Sponsor: Richard Robins, Ph.D. Psychology Shyness, or inhibition when engaging with unfamiliar others, isan important personality trait. Culture, and particularly theacculturation process in which individuals experience changesin cultural orientation, might influence how shyness developswithin individuals (Gudi\u00f1o & Lau,2010). However, few studieshave examined how acculturation factors, such as language useand generational status, are associated with the development ofshyness in Mexican-origin youth across adolescence. In this study, we will examine the co-development of shyness and acculturation from age 10 to 16, using data from a large,longitudinal study of Mexican-origin youth(N=674). We expectfirst-generation youth to show higher initial levels of shynessthan youth born in the U.S. Additionally, we expect youth withhigher English proficiency to show greater decreases in shynessacross adolescence, and vice versa. We will assess shynessusing the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire (Ellis &Rothbart, 2001), and Spanish and English language using theHazuda Acculturation and Assimilation Scale (Hazuda et al.1988). We will run bivariate latent growth curve models to testour predictions and use multi-group models to examine whethergender moderates the associations between acculturation andshyness. The findings may have implications for developingculturally-tailored interventions to help Mexican-origin youthreduce their shyness. Behavioral Plasticity in Personality and Dominance in Relation to Stress Response in Female Wood Ducks ( Aix sponsa ) Rachel Hirota Sponsor: John Eadie, Ph.D. & Fisheries Biology Animals display personalities through consistent individualvariation in behavior in response to their environment. Thecomplex behaviors and social interactions of birds provide anexcellent opportunity to relate avian personality to ecology andevolution. Behavioral traits\u2014such as boldness, exploration, andaggressiveness\u2014and plasticity of these traits can greatly impactphysiological trade-offs and population dynamics. The WoodDuck (Aix sponsa) is a model species for female sociality and behavioral studies as females are philopatric, exhibit conspecificbrood parasitism, and are cavity-nesting\u2014allowing for ampleopportunity for female-female interactions. While personality hasbeen explored in many facets, its role in understandingindividual stress response has received less attention, evenmore so in relation to female social hierarchies. This study aimsto a) determine long-term plasticity of personality throughbehavioral assessments and b) contribute to a project relatingpersonality to stress physiology. Behavioral plasticity will beassessed longitudinally by performing standardized behavioralassays of In-Hand Docility Tests (IHDT) and Open Field Tests(OFT) and dominance ranks will be evaluated using food accessexperiments. These data will then be compared to data from thesame birds collected during previous (younger) life stages. The Role of Migratory Status on Changes in Phenology in Response to Climate Change in Seabirds Rachel Hirota Sponsor: Joshua Hull, Ph.D. Animal Science Approximately one-third of seabird species are vulnerable orendangered, making them the most threatened species-groupof birds. All with invasive species and bycatch, climate change isone of the main global threats to seabirds. As climatic changesalter resource availability, the ability for animals to alter theirbehavior in response to climate change has consequences forfitness and population ecology. There is increasing evidencethat arrival and breeding dates have advanced in birds overall;however, this advancement is heterogeneous among species.The reduced amount of change in phenology among long-distance migrants compared to short-distance migrants andresident birds suggests that long-distance migrants have limitedability to respond to climatic changes. While a number ofstudies have investigated changes in mean lay dates inresponse to climate change, few have focused on migratorystatus' role on the species-group level, especially seabirds. Thismeta-analytic study aims to determine the plasticity ofphenology in seabirds in response to climate change in relationto migratory status. Here, we relate changes in mean lay andhatch dates over time by seabirds in temperate and polarregions to their migratory status while using changes in seasurface temperature as an indicator of climatic change.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 55Extracellular Matrix Mimicking Nanofibrous Scaffolds matrix (ECM) is critical to inducing tissue regeneration through their network structure andbiological components. The ECM architecture can be mimickedvia electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds, which provide EV modified scaffolds, the physiological interactions between theECM and EVs, are a potential strategy for mediating significantbiological function. Previously, we identified LLP2A, an integrina4\u00df1 ligand, which had a strong binding to human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs). In this study, weisolated (PMSC-EVs) could improve endothelial cell(EC) migration vascular sprouting in an ex vivo aortic ringassay. We found that LLP2A PMSC-EV modified electrospunscaffolds significantly promoted EC survival and angiogenicgene expression and suppressed the expression of apoptoticmarkers. Thus, PMSC-EVs hold promising potential tofunctionalize biomaterial constructs and improve vascularization.The EVs modified biomaterial scaffolds can be widely used fordifferent tissue engineering applications, making them aversatile tool for regenerative medicine. Measurement of the Space-Charge Region Width in BiVO 4 Particle Films with Surface Photovoltage Spectroscopy Brett Hodges Sponsor: Frank Osterloh, Ph.D. materials, vanadate(BiVO 4), as nanoparticulate catalysts for photocatalytic water- splitting on the nature of electronic-band bendingphenomena at the semiconductor-liquid interface. Electric fieldspresent at this interface reduce the concentration of majoritycharge carriers within a region of the semiconductor, creatingwhat is commonly referred to as a depletion/space-chargeregion (SCR). Currently, models based upon bulk semiconductorsystems are used to measure the width of this SCR and relate itto electronic properties of the system, such as charge carrierdensity and interfacial voltage. A recent study has indicated thatthe SCR of nanoparticle systems can be effectively investigatedwith surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS). In this work, weutilize SPS to probe the SCR width in BiVO 4 particle films. Photoactive BiVO4 particles with an optical bandgap of 2.49 eV were produced via a Filmswere on gold-coated glass substrates viaelectrophoretic and subsequently annealed.Characterization with optical microscopy and diffuse reflectancespectroscopy was conducted. Based on previous findings, theobserved SCR width is predicted to be orders of magnitudelarger than that calculated from bulk system models. Thecurrent status of SPS characterization is to be discussed.Extracellular Matrix Nanofibrous Scaffolds (ECM) is critical toinducing tissue regeneration through their network structure andbiological components.

Facial Emotion Perception and Theory of Mind in Preschool Children Aditi Hosangadi Sponsor: Lindsay Bowman, Ph.D. Psychology Many theorists have suggested that the early perceptualprocessing of emotional faces could play a role in the laterunderstanding of emotions and other mental states. However,research exploring this relationship has been lacking. Previousresearch has highlighted the preschool years as an importantperiod of development for theory of mind (ToM), the ability tounderstand and reason about others' mental states. Thepresent study aims to explore the connection between theory ofmind and emotion perception in preschool children. Werecorded electroencephalogram (EEG) data while participantsviewed emotional faces and used the modulation of the N170, aface-sensitive event-related potential (ERP) component, as ameasure of emotion perception. We assessed ToM via twomeasures: the Simplified Eye Reading Test (SERT), which askschildren to determine emotional state based on pictures ofeyes, and Wellman and Liu's mental state reasoning task battery(2004). We hypothesize that greater N170 modulation inresponse to emotion will correlate with greater ToM scores onboth measures and that the correlation will be stronger withmental state decoding (SERT) than with mental state reasoning.The results could provide insight on emotion perception as aprecursor of ToM and into differences between subcomponentsof ToM.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 56Achievement Gaps and Gender Disparities in Higher Education Christine How Sponsor: Kristin Kiesel, Ph.D. Ag & Resource Economics The gender distribution in the Agricultural and Environmental Sciences Department at UC Davis is fairly equal, with even morefemale students in some STEM majors, but are women in STEMmajors still having a more difficult time than men, in terms oflearning experience and outcomes? According to the U.SDepartment of Labor, \"women are still underrepresented inSTEM occupations, with women's share of computer workersactually declining since 1990.\" This research uses regressionanalysis to investigate the underrepresentation of women inSTEM disciplines, and the effect switching to remote instructionhas on academic outcomes. The dataset incorporates 1972observations and 111 variables of students in three STEM majorsat UC Davis (Managerial Economics, Economics, andEnvironmental Sciences and Management), each with a differentgender distribution. Academic outcomes are defined as gradesin the major core classes; by regressing grades frompreparatory classes or exams on subsequent classes, whilecontrolling for variables including gender, admission status(highschool admit/transfer), and class gender distribution, thisresearch will examine the significance of each factor indetermining academic success/failure. The findings of thisresearch will further the understanding of the higher educationsystem, especially in overcoming achievement gaps in STEMmajors. The Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Well-Being of the Asian Pacific Islander American (APIA) Population Ages 18-30 Residing in Yolo and Sacramento, California Tan Hua Sponsor: Christian Bohringer, M.D. MED: Anesth & Pain Medicine Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, is an infectiouscommunicable respiratory illness that has affected over 100,000people throughout Sacramento and Yolo County. During thepandemic, social distancing and lockdown measures were putin place to ensure the safety of our communities. Mental healthissues have become relatively common in the youth group dueto social isolation. Our aim is to investigate, to what degree hasCOVID-19 impacted the mental well-being of the Asian & PacificIslander American (APIA) community, ages 18-30, residing in theYolo County and Sacramento City/County, CA region comparedto the Caucasian population? Our online survey asksparticipants to rate statements based on their mental health,healthcare access, and academic performances. Our survey wasopened from January 20th, 2021 to February 3rd, 2021. Oursample group (n = 147) consisted of 32 participants identifying asCaucasian and 94 participants identifying as Asian/PacifierIslander. Our data suggest that Caucasian and APIAcommunities are experiencing depressive symptoms. However,the APIA community reported having a higher impact ofnegative effects related to depression, anxiety, mood, andstress levels. In conclusion, there should be more resources tosupport the APIA community regarding their mental well-being,especially during this time.Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mechanism and Role in Lipid Upregulation and Liver Regeneration in NAFLD Victoria Huang Sponsor: Michele La Merrill, Ph.D. Environmental Toxicology Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), defined as excessivelipid accumulation not caused by alcohol, is becomingincreasingly prevalent among countries where a Western diet(WD) predominates. Affecting about 25% of the US population,NAFLD is the leading cause of chronic liver disease with noapproved medical treatment. The epidermal growth factorreceptor (EGFR), a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase(RTK) activated to control cell proliferation and differentiation, ishighly expressed in the liver and its overexpression is shown toplay a role in regulating lipid metabolism and NAFLDprogression. Research methods involved a literature reviewapproach to compile current knowledge of EGFR signalingnetwork and upregulation of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) throughscientific and murine model studies. This reviewrevealed that in NAFLD-induced mice studies, EGFR inhibition(EGFRi) was shown to downregulate transcription factorsgoverning DNL, which suggests the potential of EGFRi as apromising treatment. Additional studies showed that in WD-fedmice, proliferation of cells was upregulated by EGFR, andtherefore regeneration was enhanced, which demonstratesinduction of mild NAFLD may be beneficial after hepatectomies.However, further work illustrating regulation of EGFR on DNL inliver cells specifically is necessary to develop an effectivetherapy. Investigating the Role of Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in DNA Methylation and Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Progression Cynthia Molec Genetics Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the third leading cause ofcancer-related death in the United States with a 10% five-yearsurvival rate. Recent research has shown that epigeneticalterations, such as DNA methylation, could facilitate PDAmetastasis. Poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),compounds commonly used in commercial products, arepositively correlated with certain human malignancies, includingPDA. How PFAS promotes PDA progression is unknown, butstudies have shown that PFAS can alter DNA methylation invitro and in vivo. Therefore, we hypothesize that PFAS facilitates PDA progression by altering the DNA methylation landscape. Totest the hypothesis, we will first treat murine normal and PDAorganoids with PFAS. Next, gene expressions of the DNAmethylation enzymes will be analyzed using reversetranscription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Finally, we treatmentwill induce gene expression changes in DNA methylationenzymes, potentially leading to widespread changes in the DNAmethylation landscape. Our data will hopefully provide themolecular mechanism of how PFAS exposures promote PDAprogression and support health intervention to reduce PDArisks.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 57Phenotypic characterization of \u00df-carotene hydroxylase (HYD) mutants in tetraploid wheat Jin Huang Sponsor: Li Tian, Ph.D. Plant Sciences The widely recognized public health issue of vitamin A deficiency can be addressed by increasing provitamin A \u00df-carotene content in major cereals like wheat throughbiofortification. However, the turnover of \u00df-carotene, partiallycontrolled by \u00df-carotene hydroxylase (HYD), to downstreamproducts reduces its accumulation in wheat grains. Althoughgrains of hyd mutant plants with abolished HYD functionaccumulate more \u00df-carotene, the growth and development ofmutant plants with perturbed carotenoid metabolism needs tobe evaluated. We measured the growth phenotypes ofseedlings, flag leaves, and whole shoots in 11 combinatorialmutants in HYD-A1, HYD-B1, HYD-A2, and HYD-B2 genehomoeologs hyd-a1 hyd-b1 hyd-a2 hyd-b2 quadruple mutant seedlings grew distinctivelyslower in light condition, but faster in dark condition relative tothe control. The quadruple mutants also matured slower andappeared paler relative to other mutant lines with a functionalcopy of HYD. Interestingly, the specific leaf areas of flag leavesin the quadruple mutant were not substantially different fromother lines. Our result provided insights into the contribution ofHYD genes and their homoeologs in plant growth anddevelopment, which can be used to select the appropriatemutant combinations for vitamin A biofortification in wheat. Septins Respond to Expression of Neurodegenerative Proteins to Regulate Autophagy and Cell Viability Emily Huang Sponsor: Kenneth Kaplan, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio Alpha-synuclein is a neuronal protein involved in formingneurotoxic aggregates, typically observed in Alzheimer's andParkinson's diseases. These aggregates are thought to induce aproteotoxic response in cells that includes autophagy activation.Septins are a class of cytoskeletal proteins associated withcellular membranes. Evidence from the Kaplan lab suggest theyallow for proper autophagy regulation during nutrient starvationby re-organizing on the cell cortex limit autophagosomeformation. I hypothesize that under alpha-syn induced stress,septins will organize at the cell cortex and limit autophagy topreserve cell viability. The septin-encoding taggedwith green fluorescent protein (Cdc10-GFP) was expressed incontrol cells and in cells under 3hrs of alpha-synucleinoverexpression. Preliminary data has indicated that cellularresponses involve a reduction in the percent of cells with collarsand rings, and an increase of Cdc10-GFP signal at the cortex. Incells expressing alpha-synuclein, there is and variability in structures. For moreinsight into septin organization at the cortex, I will use imageprocessing approaches of optical deconvolution and machinelearning to enhance image resolution. With this approach, wehope to better understand how septin re-organization at the cellcortex regulates autophagy after alpha-syn induced proteotoxicstress.Investigating the Response to Health-Related Messages Over Social Media Qihua Huang Sponsor: Debbie Fetter, Ph.D. Nutrition In the US, about 7 of 10 individuals use social media to seek outinformation. However, this widespread use of social mediameans there is an increased risk of finding false information,especially for health-related topics. Message framing is a fundamental component of communication strategy that can influence exposure of amessage. Messages can be framed to emphasize either thebenefits of engaging in a behavior (a gain-frame), theconsequences of failing to participate in a behavior (a loss-frame), or the potential danger of not adoptingrecommendations (a fear appeal). This study will develop gain-framed, loss-framed, and fear- based health messages to investigate the response between apopulation with high-use of social media versus one with low-use. Participants will complete a survey about their social mediause, perceived level of knowledge about these health topics,and responses to these health messages in the differentframings. Questions will be included to measure perceivedaccuracy, how likely they would be to share the message withtheir social network, and self-efficacy towards behavior change.The results can be used to investigate how to more effectivelydisseminate health messages over social media to helpindividuals adopt beneficial behaviors. Titanium Intercalation into 2D nanomaterial thathas attracted much interest in recent years as it is a noveltopological insulator. Bi2Se3 has incredible chemical potentialbecause its chemical and physical properties can be tunedthrough intercalation, the insertion of a guest species into ahost material. In this work, two novel wet chemical strategiesare introduced to intercalate atomic titanium into a 2D layeredchalcogenide. In the first method, zero-valent titanium is createdthrough reduction of a halogenated titanium precursor with tinchloride in tetrahydrofuran. The second method takesinspiration from the Kroll Process, an industrial process that usesmagnesium metal to completely reduce titanium chloride (IV)(TiCl4) without additional refining. Magnesium shavings areadded flask with pentane and the substrate.Both intercalation methods have shown to be general asintercalation is demonstrated in Bi2Se3, GeS, and other 2Dlayered nanomaterials. This chemical intercalation providesnovel properties for possible energy or catalytic materialsapplications. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 58Fullerene Metal Coordination and Molecular Surgery Banann Isbeih Sponsor: Alan Balch, Ph.D. Chemistry Recent advances in synthetic chemistry have allowed for the possibility to perform molecular surgery and expand uponprevious endohedral fullerene research. Molecular surgeryenables us to perform C-C bond scission to create and enlargeorifices on the surface of a fullerene, as a precursor to smallmolecule insertion. Encapsulation after molecular surgery hasbeen observed with smaller covalent compounds like water andformaldehyde. However, due to size, the isolation of platinumand palladium coordinated fullerenes are still being investigated.As per the findings of Murata, M. Murata and K. Komatsu,palladium-fullerene coordination complexes have been isolatedand identified. These findings suggest that coordinating another d 10 metal, such as platinum, would be a promising candidate for C60 derivative, MMK9. MMK9 contains an activated carbon double bond surrounded by two carbonyl moieties, which facilitates metal coordination. It is our goal to syntheticallyexecute these procedures, maximize purification and selectivity,isolate and crystallize these compounds, and characterize andhost-guest interactions using X-ray crystallography as well asNMR, IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Differing Iyer Sponsor: Lynna Dhanani, Ph.D. Religious Studies In popular culture, the word karma is commonly used to conveythe idea of \"reaping what you sow\" and is used rather loosely.One hears the phrases \"good karma\" and \"bad karma\" all thetime. However, in the South Asian religious context, themeaning of the term and its implication for realizing religiousgoals are highly contextualized, diverse, and debated. Mypresentation will focus on the ways in which the South Asianreligions of Jainism and Hinduism perceive the accumulation ofkarma\u2014and for the Jains, it is literally considered a materialsubstance\u2014as well as the most effective ways to eliminate it andachieve liberation from worldly bondage and a state ofcomplete knowledge of the higher Self and the world. I willanalyze both Jain scriptures as well as Hindu primary textswritten between the fourth century B.C.E. and fifth century C.E.to deduce prominent ideological differences between karmicinflux and retribution, and re-consider the role of knowledge ineliminating karma as articulated by both systems. Knowledge isconsidered an inherent aspect of the soul in both systems,although characterized, as is karma, in remarkably unique ways.Site-specific Phosphorylation of CLOCK Protein Joanna Chiu, Ph.D. Entomology/Nematology Circadian rhythms in animal physiology are dependent onsynchronization of external environmental time cues withinternal molecular oscillators. CLOCK (CLK) protein is a keycomponent of the Drosophila molecular oscillator. Althoughphosphorylation has been established to play a central role inregulating protein activity, the mechanisms by whichphosphorylation regulates CLK transcriptional activity is reducesCLK transcriptional activity by removing it from clock genepromoters. To test this hypothesis, we generated aphosphospecific antibody to confirm CK1a-dependentphosphorylation of CLK(S13) in Drosophila cells. We conductedvalidation experiments in Drosophila S2 tissue culture cells toconfirm the specificity of the CLK(S13) antibody. We performedtransient transfection of S2 cells to coexpress and ck1a.Specificity of the CLK(S13) antibody is evaluated byimmunoprecipitation followed by Western Blotting to determinethe phosphorylation status of CLK(S13). Additionally, CRISPRinjections are underway to generate clk(S13A)nonphosphorylatable and clk(S13D) phosphomimetic fly mutants,which will be used how CLK(S13) phosphorylationaffects CLK transcriptional activity in vivo. Results of this studywill provide a better understanding of how phosphorylationmodulates CLK function and regulates animal circadian rhythms. Functional Genetics to Analyze Effects of Genes Involved in Drought Tolerance and Seed Composition in Arabidopsis thaliana and Maize Abelina Jackson Sponsor: Christine Diepenbrock, Ph.D. Plant Sciences Climate change has involved a 20-40% reduction in meanprecipitation rates, increased high-temperature stress, and anoverall decrease in staple crop viability in portions of LatinAmerica, reducing agricultural productivity with losses reaching$13 billion. This poses a threat to many rural farmers who relyprimarily on subsistence farming as well as the global foodmarkets depending on their exports. The aim of this study is touse functional genetics approaches to examine crop toleranceto drought stress and potential pleiotropic effects on seednutritive quality. Three genes found in maize, ZmASR3, ZmPYL12, and zmm28, have previously been tested inArabidopsis thaliana that when overexpressed result in elevateddrought tolerance through varying mechanisms. Using the floraldip transformation method and a drydown shared potexperiment of primary transformants, we will measuregravimetric soil water content, transpiration, and stomatalconductance, as well as seed quality traits via AOCC wet-chemistry methods for protein, fat and starch content. We willthen apply methods and findings of these physiological,biochemical, and molecular characterizations in Arabidopsis inmaize as well, to determine the manner and extent to whichthese genes promote similar patterns of drought tolerance,yield, and nutritive quality response as in Arabidopsis.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 59Chiral Organosilicon Compounds as Novel Catalysts and Ligands Sarai Jaime Sponsor: Annaliese Franz, Ph.D. Chemistry Silicon can be found in many organic compounds such as in everyday products ranging from agricultural chemicals topersonal care products. Previous work in the Franz groupdemonstrated that silanol-containing organic catalysts possessunique hydrogen bonding and anion recognition properties;however, reactions to selectively produce chiral-at-siliconcenter remain limited. This work describes a new approach tocreating molecules with stereogenic silicon centers using abifunctional chiral amide catalyst for a selective silylationreaction. The goal of this project is to synthesize and evaluatedifferent catalyst analogs by changing the Lewis base part of thecatalyst, which we hypothesize to be important for inducingselectivity. The silylation reaction will be monitored usingspectroscopic and kinetic methods to determine the selectivityobtained using each catalyst. In addition, binding studies will beconducted to analyze and compare binding interactions foreach catalyst using NMR spectroscopy. The results of thesemethods and studies will provide insight into the rarely studiedreactions to produce molecules with stereogenic silicon Jardel Sponsor: Katharine Graf Estes, Ph.D. Psychology It seems instinctive for adults to use infant-directed speech (IDS)when speaking to infants\u2014they raise their pitch, slow theirspeech, and exaggerate their intonation. Acoustic features haveshown significant impacts on infant word-learning (Ma et al.,2011), but elaboration may also play a role. While a study hasshown that repeating words facilitates word-learning (Maura etal., 2020), elaboration could also be important for languageacquisition by exposing infants to the context of words. Thisstudy will examine the difference between repetition andelaboration of IDS and its relationship to infants' vocabularydevelopment. Twenty American-English speaking parent-childdyads participated in a set of interactive tasks that containedobjects labelled with target words. Audio recordings will beanalyzed for the frequencies of target words spoken (e.g. cow)and additional descriptors used per object (e.g. \"cows makemilk\"). We also collected parental reports of infant vocabularysize. We predict that infants whose parents use additionaldescriptors will have larger vocabularies than infants whoseparents use more isolated repetitions of target words. Wepropose that elaborations are important because it diversifiesword exposure. Understanding the role of repetition andelaboration in IDS is important because they may facilitate infantlanguage acquisition.Image and Text as the Sources of Inspiration for Tablada's Poetry Jair Jauregui Torres Sponsor: Leopoldo Bernucci, Ph.D. Spanish & Portuguese This examines poem \"Soneto Watteau\" by theMexican writer Jos\u00e9 Juan Tablada. By exquisitelanguage, which assimilates a painted image, Tablada alludes to a well-known artwork, Pilgrimage to Cythera by the 18 th century painter Jean-Antoine Watteau. The allusions to this painting indicate the use of the ekphrasis, a rhetorical figure in which avivid description is made of an artwork to replicate it in the mindof the reader. However, Tablada diverts from meticulouslyrepresenting Watteau's painting; instead, he only references themost distinguishable features from it, such as the author himselfand its compositional elements. To fully understand thisekphrastic exercise, a comparison between the two works - thepainting and the poem - must be done to distinguish similaritiesthat faithfully replicate the visual components to the text andalso their differences, such as the intertextual allusion to a figurewho does not belong to the painting, Manon Lescaut from theeponymous novel by Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost. With and literaryreferences, Tablada produces an iconotext between Watteau and the seductive female Manon to synthesize from a 19 th century perspective the gallantry and amorous desires amongupper class characters typical of 18 th century artistic representations. Effects of Depression and Anxiety on the Processing of Negative Words Emotions, Language, Attention, Memory Laura Jett Sponsor: Tamara Swaab, Ph.D. Psychology In the face of rising depression and anxiety, as well as unresolved questions from past research on cognitive bias inthese disorders, this study aims to examine how depression andanxiety affect the processing of words with a negative meaning(e.g., grief). Specifically, I will compare participants across thespectrum of depression and anxiety on how they processnegative vs. neutral words on measures of attention (emotionalStroop task), implicit memory (word naming), and explicitmemory (recollection task). I will also evaluate potentialmodulating factors such as stimulus self-relevance andperformance on a classic Stroop task. Prior literature suggeststhat while we may see attention and memory bias towardsnegative words overall for both anxious and depressedindividuals, we may expect an even greater attention andmemory bias towards negative words in these individuals fordisorder-specific, self-relevant words. Such a finding would beimportant because negativity bias has been implicated as a riskfactor for anxiety and depression. By comparing depression-related, anxiety-related, and uncategorized negative words, andby evaluating stimulus self-relevance, this study can assesswhether there is bias towards negative information moregenerally, or if the bias is disorder-specific, which may haveimplications for future research and interventions.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 60Modeling Familial Pancreatic Cancer With CRISPR/Cas9 to Develop Personalized Cancer Keely Ji Sponsor: Changil Hwang, D.V.M.,Ph.D. Microbiology & Molec Genetics Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Around 10% of pancreatic cancercases are categorized as familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) andare associated with germline mutations in genes related to theDNA repair pathway. To develop targeted treatments for thesepatients, we created models that recapitulate the FPC genemutations in a murine pancreatic cancer cell line and found thatFPC gene deficiency conferred sensitivity to an epigenetic drugcalled bromodomain inhibitor (e.g., JQ1), from interactingwith the acetylated histones. This study aims to elucidate themechanism of JQ1 drug sensitivity in FPC gene-deficient cells.The analysis of RNA-seq data and Gene Set EnrichmentAnalysis prompted us to hypothesize that JQ1 induces apoptoticcell death through increasing DNA damage and suppressingDNA repair pathways. To test this, I will perform western blotand indirect immunofluorescence to measure the cellularamounts of DNA damage, repair, and apoptotic proteins uponJQ1 treatment in FPC gene-deficient cells and compare to theJQ1-treated controls. Understanding the mechanism of JQ1 drugsensitivity will provide essential information to strategizeeffective combination therapy that will synergize with JQ1 toinduce synthetic lethality. Muscle mitochondrial energetics is associated with muscle performance in chronic kidney disease Sami Jin Sponsor: Baback Roshanravan, M.D. MED: Int Med Nephrology (sac) Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects an estimated 37 millionindividuals in the United States. Reduced kidney function leadsto insulin resistance, metabolic acidosis and retention of uremictoxins contributing to skeletal muscle dysfunction and musclewasting (sarcopenia). Skeletal muscle dysfunction leads tomobility limitation, loss of functional independence, andvulnerability to disease complications. In CKD, impaired musclemitochondrial energetics is a major mechanism underlyingsarcopenia and impaired mobility. There is an urgent need toidentify interventions improving muscle mitochondrial ATPgeneration and how these improvements translate into muscleand physical functioning. We performed a cross-sectional studynested in a randomized controlled trial of exercise in personswith CKD to determine the association of in vivo musclemitochondrial energetics with muscle work output from cycleergometry cardiopulmonary exercise testing. We measured legmuscle mitochondrial capacity consumption (VO 2max) and work output from cycle ergometry in patients with moderate to severe CKD. Collectively, our preliminary findings suggest that in vivoenergetics of muscle mitochondria in patients with chronickidney disease is associated with muscle performance andefficiency. Body Satisfaction and School Belongingness among Adolescents Nicole Johnston Sponsor: Adrienne Nishina, Ph.D. Human Ecology Schools act as socialization contexts, in which feeling like onebelongs can affect a variety of adolescent life outcomes, suchas healthy psychological adjustment and successfulrelationships. (e.g., McNeely, Nonnemaker, & Blum, 2002).Additionally, body satisfaction beliefs during adolescence arealso largely based on socialization within social contexts(Liechty et al., 2016). Therefore, while it is plausible that there isa relationship between adolescents' feelings of schoolbelonging one feels and body satisfaction, little is known aboutthis link. We drew data from a longitudinal quantitative study oftwelfth grade adolescents, with data from one school siteincluding 118 adolescents (50% Results of bivariatecorrelations indicated that among girls but not boys, a positivesense of school belonging was associated with a myriad ofpositive body satisfaction indicators, including feeling satisfiedwith the shape of their body (r = .44, p < .001) and feeling happy about their appearance (r = .42, p < .001). These findingssuggest that contexts, such as schools, may play a central rolein adolescents' psychosocial well-being. Therefore, schools maybe an important context in which body satisfaction interventionscould take place. Isolation and Characterization of Anaerobic Fungi in the Rumen Jillian Jordan Sponsor: Matthias Hess, Ph.D. Animal Science Ruminants rely on microbial communities of archaea, bacteria,protozoa, and fungi within the rumen to break down plantbiomass into nutrients for the host animal. Anaerobic fungi inparticular play a vital role in this fiber degradation by providingenzymatic functions that other microbes cannot. Thoughimportant, anaerobic fungi remain understudied due tochallenges encountered when trying to isolate and study themin a laboratory setting. By using targeted methods aimed atisolating more of these anaerobic fungi, including media tailoredfor viable spore formation and carefully monitored anaerobicenvironments, we can procure an untapped resource withinthese microorganisms. Growing and isolating these fungi intopure cultures will allow for the DNA amplification andsequencing of the ITS1 region, an established taxonomic markerregion to determine the taxonomy (and the novelty) of theobtained isolate. Through enzymatic activity assays on thesefungal isolates, we can ascertain the ecological niches of thesefungi, further contributing to the known ecological roles ofrumen microbes and how they complement one another and thehost.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 61Using CRISPR-Cas9 to Create Genetic Knockouts for Increasing Meiotic Recombination in Lettuce Nina Jorgensen Sponsor: Richard Michelmore, Ph.D. Plant Sciences Meiotic crossovers play a critical role in generating genetic diversity within populations. Little is known about theirregulation in plants, but recently, several anti-crossover geneshave been identified, including FIGL1, FANCM, and the RECQ4helicases. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is a popular vegetable in theAmerican diet and has a high economic value. Increasingmeiotic crossovers will speed up breeding programs forimproving disease resistance, tolerance to environmental stress,and other desirable traits. For this reason, we aim to testwhether knockouts of these genes will enhance crossoverformation in lettuce. I used Golden Gate cloning to createplasmids encoding Cas9 along with multiple guide RNA'sdirected toward RECQ4B to increase the likelihood of itsdisruption after transformation in lettuce plants. While awaitingthese transgenic plants, I screened previously generatedFANCM, FIGL1, and RECQ4A transgenic plants for editing atdifferent sites in their respective genes. Since the editingefficiency was low in these lines, I am now creating and testingnew construct designs to increase the editing efficiency infuture experiments. Phase I/II Trial of BMS-986205 and Nivolumab as First Line Therapy Hepatocellular Carcinoma carcinoma (HCC) is a frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide and incidence of HCC is rising.Sorafenib and lenvatinib are approved for first-line use inunresectable HCC; however, survival benefit remains low Nivolumab, a human monoclonal antibody toprogrammed death-1 (PD-1) receptor, has been approved including HCC, and has been shown to play acentral role in immune suppression within the tumormicroenvironment. BMS-986205 selectively inhibits IDO1without activity against another tryptophan degradation enzyme,tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase. This project to 240mg inunresectable toevaluate safety and tolerability, and to determine efficacydefined by objective response rate. Secondary objectives are toevaluate disease control rate, duration of response, progressionfree survival, and overall survival. Patients will be followed for100 days after the last dose of treatment or until all treatment-related clinical toxicities resolve to baseline or grade = 1.Increasing for Leg Amputees Megan Jow Sponsor: Jonathon Schofield, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr As more people work from home during this pandemic, methodsfor making resources accessible at home have surged. Theobjective of this project is to provide a leg amputee with acomfortable mode of moving about her home by designing andbuilding a cart. Current market alternatives to a prosthetic leginclude: wheelchairs, crutches, and knee scooters. Unlike thebulky features, limited mobility, and low comfort of currentdevices, our design focuses on providing a comfortableexperience for our client while maintaining her mobility. Thisdesign has four main parts: the wheel base, the pylon, thesocket, and the handle. This design's key features are: a brakingmechanism, a working knee joint, a height adjustable handle,and an easily attachable socket. While developing this device,we interviewed our client, assessed our client's needs,researched current market products, and decided on a workingdesign. Once our working design was established, we usedconcept screening to assess how well our design met ourclient's needs and researched materials to use for each part ofthe design. We are creating the CAD models for our device'scomponents. After finishing the CAD, we will begin prototypingand testing our design. Night and day: Rate of Affiliative Behavior Depends on Time of day in Novel Pairings of Titi Monkeys (Plecturocebus cupreus (Plecturocebus cupreus) are socially monogamous primates that form long-term attachments to theirpair mates. During daytime observations following pairing, newpairs engage in increasing rates of affiliation (i.e., tailsintertwined, bodily contact, proximity) across their first weektogether. Rates of affiliation during the night have never beenstudied, but titi monkey pairs typically sleep in contact with theirtails intertwined. In order to understand how rates of affiliationdiffer based on time of day and time spent together, we studied10 newly-formed adult titi pairs across their first week together.Overall, new pairs spent significantly more time in affiliativecontact at night compared to during the day (t = 6.78, p < .001). Even on their first night together, new pairs spent an average of76% of their time in contact, while they spent only 35% of theirtime in contact during the day. Rate of affiliation increasedacross the first week post-pairing at night (t = 7.03, p = .002), but not during the day (t = 0.12, p > .05). These results may indicate that nighttime affiliation has additional benefits incomparison to daytime affiliation, such as postural balance orthermoregulation.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 62Lupgist: An Interactive Commenting System for Code Gists Arjun Kahlon Sponsor: Joel Porquet, typical programming blogs, Github \"gists\" have become one of the preferred ways for tech writers to showcase snippets ofcode in their articles. Unfortunately, the code is always shown tovisitors in a read-only way, with no possibility of interaction. Ourproposed project, Lupgist, aims to develop a lightweightembeddable commenting system that allows visitors to directlycomment on the code displayed in a gist. This way, visitors cangive precise feedback on certain lines of code, or ask specificquestions on areas of confusion. Such pursuit would foster amore integrated discussion for shared code, as well ascontribute to making Computer Science more accessible for all.The first prototype of Lupgist is currently being developed as aself-hosting full-stack web application. It will include usefulfeatures, such as anonymous commenting, ratings, andmoderation. As development continues, Lupgist will stay opensource with hopes to become a powerful platform for onlineauthors. The Role of Digital Media on College Students' Future Career Beliefs Elise Kam Sponsor: Adrienne Nishina, Ph.D. Human Ecology As students were forced to spend months at home during theCOVID-19 lockdowns, digital media has played an increasinglyprominent role in their lives. With racial tensions rising, manymay be exposed to racial discrimination online. These negativeexperiences may shape college students' expectations of futuresocial environments. Drawing on data from a longitudinal studyfollowing college students, this study examines the relationshipbetween exposure to negative representations of one'sethnicity/race in digital media and their perceptions of theirfuture career environment. Participants were 227 to untrue statements about your ethnic/racial group ondigital media is positively associated with expecting to betreated differently in your career because of your ethnicity/race(r = .16, p = .02), expecting to experience difficulty getting hiredbecause of your ethnicity/race (r = .25, p < .001), and expectingto experience ethnic/racial discrimination in your career (r = .16,p = .02). These findings highlight how exposure to racist digitalmedia can lead to expectations of discrimination in one's futureworkplace environment. Future analyses will consider multipletime points and disaggregate findings across ethnic-racialgroups.Progress Towards the Total Synthesis of Ibogaine Through a Cascading Sequence Elya Kandahari Sponsor: David Olson, Ph.D. Chemistry Recently, our lab discovered that certain structural analogs ofibogaine, an indole alkaloid originally isolated from a WestAfrican shrub, are exceptionally potent neural plasticity-promoting compounds that show potential to alleviatedepression, anxiety and addiction. Access to useful quantities ofibogaine in the past has relied on isolation from natural sources;however, this method of isolation is inefficient andenvironmentally taxing. Thus, the development of an efficienttotal synthesis of ibogaine is necessary to access sufficientquantities of this molecule for further biological testing. Despitenotable advances in chemical synthesis, reliable methods for theconstruction of ibogaine are lacking, as previous syntheses areseverely hindered by high step counts and low yields. Here, wepropose a concise 4 step strategy for total synthesis ofibogaine. The synthesis involves a cascading sequence toassemble the tricyclic ring system of the ibogaine molecule fromreadily accessible building blocks. Preliminary data suggeststhat the desired product was achieved. Structural Elucidation of Various Soy-Products Akshaya Karthikeyan Sponsor: Carlito Ph.D. of environmentally conscious diets, soy productshave become one of the most popular alternatives to their dairycounterparts. Soy is consumed in various forms including soymilk, tofu, miso, and flour. While the total dietary fiber content ofthese products is known, the specific carbohydrate structurespresent are still poorly understood. Structural elucidation ofthese is imperative to understanding the effects they have onhealth through their interaction with the gut microbiota.Preliminary work shows that the processing methods used toobtain these products from soybeans alter themonosaccharide composition and, thus, the fiberspresent significantly. To study the changes in fiber structure,the monosaccharide and glycosidic linkage compositions ofsoybean products DMSO, acid hydrolysis, UPLC-QqQ analysis. Further work involving intestinal microbiotastudies can be performed to investigate the correlationbetween food processing and the gutmicrobiome. Together, this work willfurther our understanding of how food processing impactsspecific dietary fiber structures and its potentialhealth consequences. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 63Introductions to Gender Equity and can often be difficult to navigate without prior knowledge of power dynamics caused by issues ofrace, class, gender, sexuality, disability, and more. Yet, in acontemporary sociopolitical climate that centers a need forsocial justice work, it is necessary to bring people intoconversation who would otherwise not be involved in feministdiscourse. This project seeks to create a resource for peoplehoping to enter feminist communities and build knowledge onintroductory concepts in intersectional feminist thought. Thegoal is to create a resource in the form of a podcast byengaging in conversations with people doing gender equity andsocial justice work in the Davis community as well as professorswho are doing scholarship on feminist topics. By making theseoften daunting ideas and conversions more accessible, thehope is that more people will feel empowered to enter feministspaces and engage in very necessary social justice work. Flaviviruses and the Proviral Effect of PAF1 Antagonism Matthew Kenaston Sponsor: Priya Shah, Ph.D. Chemical Engineering As a known regulator of RNA polymerase II transcription,Polymerase-Associated Factor 1 (PAF1) is poised to modulateinnate immunity through upstream regulation. PAF1 interactswith flavivirus non-structural protein 5 (NS5), a the immune pathways NS5 disrupts via itsinteraction with PAF1 remain developed CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts of PAF1along with STAT2, target Ourtranscriptomic analysis indicates PAF1 promotes a subset ofimmune genes independent of STAT2. Beyond this, we furtheridentify potential PAF1-mediated restriction of proviral genesdetected across multiple flaviviral screens. Via cellularfractionation, we also find PAF1 to accumulate in membrane-bound organelles more so during infection, suggesting anotherlayer of disruption benefiting viral pathogenesis. PAF1antagonism could, evidently, provide numerous gains toflaviviruses, highlighting the likely evolutionary advantagederived from the NS5-PAF1 interaction. Understanding theseviral mechanisms is particularly vital as the global populationfaces a growing risk to flaviviruses and the need for effectivetreatments becomes even more relevant.Increasing Accessibility of Healthy Davis Daily Symptom Tracker to Multilingual Communities Moanam Khalid Sponsor: Prabhu Shankar, M.D. MED: Public Health Sciences The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has plagued Yolo County andSacramento over the past year. As recommended by the Centerfor Disease Control, an understanding of the symptoms of thedisease is necessary to take control measures and prevent thespread of the infection. The majority of the mainstreaminformation about COVID-19 symptoms only available in theEnglish language and families with Limited English Proficiency(LEP) are left at a disadvantage. Creating a multilingual platformcan increase the accuracy of symptom capture through thetranslation of healthydavistogether.com COVID-19 symptomtracking and important information about vaccination. Theproject information will be translated into the popular languagesspoken in Yolo County which will be compiled both into a digitallibrary, as well as into a pamphlet in English and other mostcommonly spoken languages. The symptoms will be depictedwith images and checkboxes. The commonly usedrepresentations of the disease manifestations will be mapped tothe currently used English terms, as well as SNOMED-CTvocabulary. If successfully implemented and maintained, thisproject will increase awareness, data accuracy, strengthenresearch, and encourage LEP population participation in COVID-19 public health preventative measures. The model could begeneralizable to any future threats by illnesses to public health. What are the Roles of Pitch Variation and Word Repetition in Infant Vocabulary Development? Divya Khanna Sponsor: Katharine Graf (IDS), also known as baby-talk, ischaracterized by higher pitch, longer word duration, a widerpitch range, and more word repetition in comparison to Adult-Directed Speech (ADS). Prior research suggests thatcomponents of IDS affect infants' language learning. However,we do not yet know how certain linguistic elements, such asvarying pitch and word repetition, contribute to infants'vocabulary development. The current study will investigatewhether infant vocabulary size correlates with parents' pitchrange and/or the number of target word repetitions the parentproduces. We will analyze audio recordings of monolingualEnglish-speaking parents playing with their infants (n= 24, ages:10-12 months) in a task designed to elicit 14 target words (e.g.,hat, apple, boat). We will count repetitions of each target wordand measure the pitch range for these target words for eachparticipant. We will collect infant vocabulary size via parentalreports on a standardized vocabulary form. We expect thatparents with high rates of target word repetition and wide pitchranges will have infants with the largest vocabularies. Ifconfirmed , these findings would suggest that certain characteristics of IDS can be targeted to promote betterlinguistic development in infants.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 64From Bitter to Sweet: Affection and Insults in Punjabi Folk-Songs Husn Kharabanda Sponsor: Eric louis Russell, Ph.D. French & Italian Cultural variations in the expected manner of expressing emotions make folk translations complicated. In Punjabi culture,traditionally insulting statements may situationally transform intogestures of affection. This is most noticeable in Sithniyan(singular: Sithni), which are an insult-based variety of Punjabifolk-song that are viewed as gestures of intimacy and affection.To the outside observer, direct translations of Sithniyan mayappear to violate all expectations of politeness expected inEurocentric societies. This paper investigates the socialenvironments that make Sithniyan acceptable and theboundaries they observe. It looks at the rules governing insultsin Punjabi culture and explains why some insults are acceptablein folk-song but not in conversations. Compared to other folksongs, Sithniyan are less personal, mentioning no names or truegrievances and focussing instead on the comically outrageous,allowing them to include more traditionally offensive terms.They are sung only during pre-wedding ceremonies as opposedto being a part of everyday life, allowing the freedom of usinginsults to become a form of celebration and de-stressing.Understanding the place Sithniyan hold in Punjabi culture allowsthem to be understood as the unique expression of culturalidentity that they are; a step towards bridging one more culturalgap. Biodiversity: Exploring the Genetic Factors in Species Invasions Matthew Kim Sponsor: Sebastian Schreiber, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology Invasive species are a top ecological problem, andunderstanding what factors reduce their likelihood for success iscritical in improving conservation efforts. Previous studiessuggest a successful invasion can depend on the biodiversity ofthe invaded community. In theory, more diverse communitiesare more resistant to invasion, possibly due to fewer openecological niches. This study tested whether the composition ofthe invaded (resident) community affected invasion success. Weused a genotype of water flea, Daphnia, to serve as the invader,and invaded either a rival Daphnia genotype or another zooplankton community. We expected that invasion successwould be lower against the rival Daphnia because genotypes ofthe same species would share similar ecological niches. Interestingly, preliminary findings indicate that neither genotypeof invading Daphnia were successful in colonizing the fullyestablished community of other zooplankton, but were able toinvade each other. Further research should look into the role ofSimocephalis, a fierce competitor of Daphnia, and how theirinclusion in the zooplankton community may have contributedto such invasion results. From Chaos to Success: Comparing the influence of Mixed Practice to that of Categorized Sets of Questions Hanna Kim Sponsor: Ozcan Gulacar, Ph.D. Chemistry Questions in assignments for students are often grouped bychapter, topic, or concepts. The structure shows a greatemphasis on categorization. Practice problems in chemistrytextbooks are mostly organized by sections to help studentsnavigate the assignments and practice in order; however,exams usually test students with problems from a series ofchapters in a mixed format. Therefore, there is a mismatchbetween what students practice on and how they are tested.The goal of this study is to examine the structure of theassignments on students' problem-solving performances. Thestudy uses scientific control method and divides students intotwo groups throughout three experiment sessions. Each grouphad interventions with same length and identical questions butdifferent structures. The experimental group had mixedquestions, while the control group had questions organizedbased on chapters and topics. This study is critical in studyingstudents' learning abilities with mixed and categorizedproblems. The findings could help UC Davis instructors to betterstructure their teaching materials to help improve students'problem-solving abilities. Given most textbooks and instructorstend to organize and classify content for students to navigatethe knowledge base, this study is important to assess theeffectiveness of the traditional teaching method. Coming Full Circle: The Ideational Parallels of Catherine Beecher and the De Stijl Art Movement Kayetana Klinghoffer Sponsor: Diana Strazdes, Ph.D. Art & Art History Considerable energy has been put into the research of floorplans for Catharine Beecher's \"A Gerrit Rietveld. The sustainedlevel of interest is due to their enduring influence on 21st-century design and building practices. Scholars have mainlyfocused their energy on the architect's personal agendas, theirideologies, and, finally, their overall intention emphasized byattention to furniture arraignment, color, and decoration.Regardless of the substantial effort put into these studies, Ifound no scholastic attempt comparing the two. This oversight ispredictable but shortsighted. The insular nature of the scholar'sfocus is understandable given the considerable interval of timebetween subjects, the obvious polarity of the architect'spersonal principles, and oppositional aesthetic canons. In mypaper, I was able to do what no other scholar has done, drawsolid parallels between Beecher's and Rietveld's house plansbased on ideational and stylistic tenets. Such as economicpracticality including the dismissal of elitists behaviors likefrivolity and excess, and the additional goal of constructing awholesome residence where family and intellectual growth wereparamount.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities (DR) is an ocular disorder characterized by microvascular changes in the eye. Our lab has previouslyidentified a set of microRNAs (miRNAs) thatmay play a role in DR pathogenesis and can be packaged inexosomes, natural carrier and delivery vehicles. The long-termgoal is to develop miRNA-based early biomarkers and therapiesfor DR. The short-term goal was to optimize the transfection rateof a human retinal pigment epithelium (ARPE-19) cell line byexosomes and determine which cellular labeling is mosteffective. The concentrations of exosomes and the incubationperiod of transfected ARPE-19 were varied to determine whichconditions allow for the highest transfection rate. We calceinred/orange XL rate 0.23ug of exosomes were added to 10,000 ARPE-19 cellsafter a 5-hour incubation period. COVID-19 and the Wine Industry: How the Pandemic Changed the Daily Lives of Industry Workers and Influenced Wine Sales Kendal Koorenny Sponsor: Alison Bright, Ph.D. University Writing Program The international wine industry has been greatly altered sinceCOVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March of 2020. Sincethe pandemic began, the wine industry has faced significantchallenges. These challenges include the following: changes inwine sales (in terms of earnings, sales methods, and productssold), disruptions to the daily routines of wine industry workers,and adjustments in companies' marketing strategies. Theindustry has had to accommodate the changes caused as aresult of the pandemic while remaining relevant to consumers;however, while sales and employment figures have providedquantitative data, there has yet to be any qualitative data thatdemonstrates the effects of the pandemic on this industry. Inthis whitepaper directed to the wine industry, I present thestories behind all of these changes, illuminating exactly howCOVID-19 has impacted the wine industry and how theseadjustments are projected to influence the industry in the longterm.What are the Roles of Pitch Variation and Word Repetition in Infant Vocabulary Development?

Developing a Vascularized Lung Model to Observe the Effects of Inflammatory Cytokines on Endothelial/Epithelial & Molecular Med Surfactant Protein B (SPB) is essential for lung function bydecreasing the surface tension and preventing alveolar lungcollapse which results in acute respiratory distresssyndrome(ARDS). Interestingly, murine studies have shownsurfactant production declines with age, but there are fewstudies looking at this phenomenon in humans. Also, it is knownthat lung-age related diseases are often exacerbated byincreased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Here we investigate the effects of inflammatory cytokines TGF? , IL-13 and JUUL concentrate on epithelial and endothelial lungbarrier integrity using our in vitro vascularized lung model. Transepithelial/endothelial electrical resistance(TEER) was used to measure the integrity of tight junction dynamics in cell culturemodels. TEER results showed TGF? increased electricalresistance of the epithelial and endothelial barrier, whereasJUUL concentrate showed decreased electrical resistance of theepithelial and endothelial barrier. We show this vascularizedmodel is capable of measuring the effects of inflammatorycytokines on lung barrier integrity, future experiments will utilizeSPB mutant and rescue cell lines to investigate how surfactantdeficiency exacerbates the symptoms of ARDS in this in vitrovascularized lung system.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 66Using Salt Stress to Increase Biomass and Lipid Productivity for Microalgae Cultivated on Food Waste Permeate from the lipids that can be used as a feedstock for sustainable biofuels. Inhibitory factors such as thehigh cost of cultivation and harvesting are why microalgaebiofuels are not yet an affordable alternative energy resource.Cultivating microalgae on the ultra-filtered effluent ofanaerobically digested food waste permeate (FWP) has thebenefit of providing a cost-effective media rich in essentialnutrients. Previous literature reports demonstrated an increasein lipid production when cultivating microalgae in salt-stressedenvironments. Given the results of these studies, I hypothesizethat the cultivation of microalgae in FWP supplemented with saltwill induce metabolic changes in the microalgae necessary fortheir survival in the extreme environment of wastewater, thusincreasing lipid productivity. In this study, 10% FWP effluent wassupplemented with different concentrations of magnesium andsodium chloride. Initial data indicates an increase in biomassproductivity and pigment content when supplementing with highquantities of salts. Neutral lipid content for both saltsupplementation methods will be presented and compared. Theoverall goal of these salt supplementation studies is to optimizemicroalgae growth on FWP, to contribute to the body ofresearch focusing on wastewater remediation, and in theprocess, make microalgae products more economically feasible. From South Central to Black Lightning and Everything In- Between : The Representation and Engagement Offered Through Mara Brock Akil's Projects. Kyerah Kyles Sponsor: Elisa White, M.A. African American African Stds Acclaimed writer, producer, and creator Mara Brock Akil hasbeen involved in a number of projects that have put Blackactors and stories on television for a wide audience to enjoy.Starting in 1994 with being a writer on the series South Central,Akil has created a career for herself that has allowed her tocreate multiple popular series - The Game, Girlfriends, andBeing Mary Jane - to being involved as a screenwriter andproducer on other series like Black Lightning and Moesha. In her nearly three decades long career, Akil has created showsthat were once before thought impossible to make. In doingthis, she has created a network of people that actively engagewith her projects because of the representation she offers andthe relatability of her characters. The influence of her work hascrossed generations and this will be measured by studyinginteractions across platforms like podcasts and social media, aswell as conducting focus groups to better understand how BlackAmericans emotionally engage with her work. This study willoffer more insight as to how Black Americans engage withothers who have seen Akil's work as well as how theyinternalize what they see in her projects.Force-induced Cten Interactions Surrounding the Keratin Network Tzu Wei Lai Sponsor: Soichiro Yamada, Ph.D. Biomedical Engineering Epithelial tissues serve as an important protective structure. Ourcurrent project focuses on keratin 8 (k8) and keratin 18 (k18)since they are the primary intermediate filaments of simpleepithelia. The keratin network provides mechanical integrity ofepithelial tissues, and it is suggested that the keratin may serveas the force-sensing element in cells. Yet, the currentunderstanding of keratin mechano-biology is very limited. Ourlab has previously discovered that cten, a protein known to actas both tumor suppressor and promoter, accumulates aroundforce-bearing keratin fibers in vivo. My goal is to define thespecific force-induced protein-protein interactions surroundingthe keratin network in vitro. Using a microneedle to stretchkeratin filaments then adding purified cten, we observed thatcten accumulated along stretched keratin filaments. Thisindicates the cten binds keratin filaments directly in a force-dependent manner. We will further define the minimal force-sensitive sequence of cten and the role of this unique proteininteraction between keratin and cten in the context of cancer. Pandemic Homeschooling: How Will This Impact Children? Tamyia Landers Sponsor: Jacob Hibel, Ph.D. Sociology During this unpredictable time of COVID-19, there have beenmany sudden changes, some of which being related to theeducational systems. Many schools have shut down for theremaining months of the 2019-2020 academic school year, andwill continue to operate online as children progress through the2020-2021 academic school year. Children are essentially beingforced into homeschooling, which may leave some childrenfalling behind in their school work. This qualitative researchstudy explores children's educational progress and achievementas well as problems that the families face in their day to daylives in relation to the struggles brought on by COVID-19. Thisstudy involves semi-structured interviews, three per family, offour families in the US with elementary school aged childrenthrough a case study approach on the topics of educationalprogress, behavior, and access to resources, comparing beforeand after the pandemic. The findings of this study will be able toprovide insight on the benefits and downfalls of educationduring the pandemic, highlighting issues that families andschools can work on.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 67A Meta-analysis of Hospital Acquired Ralstonia spp. Infections and Their Plant Pathology gram-negative, opportunistic bacteria in the Burkholderiaceae family that have been linked to hospital- acquired, otherwise known as nosocomial, infections. The aim ofthis study is to examine the frequency and effects of nosocomialRalstonia spp. infections in patients with pre-existing conditionsand compromised immune systems. I am currently examiningliterature and compiling data points of case studies andoutbreaks of Ralstonia spp. in order to identify patterns ofinfection sources and pre-existing conditions that makeindividuals more susceptible to infection by Ralstonia spp. Thusfar, the data from 21 papers suggest that certain pre-existingconditions such as cystic fibrosis, crohn's disease, and type 2diabetes mellitus make patients susceptible to infection.Most commonly, infection by Ralstonia spp . leads to bacteremia, sepsis, and bloodstream infections. These infections andresulting ailments often prove fatal to highlyimmunocompromised individuals. They are likely caused bycontaminated oxygen delivery systems, central venouscatheters, implanted devices, and saline solutions. Mostpathogen isolates are identified as members of the polyphyleticspecies R. pickettii, but other cases and outbreaks have beenattributed to R. mannitolytica, R. insidiosa, and R. solanacearum.Work is ongoing to contextualize isolates within the knownRalstonia species using reported DNA sequences. Synthesis of of using NMR Spectroscopy to analyze theisomerization and acidity exhibit a cis-trans isomerization when excitedby light of the appropriate wavelength that changes thestructure from an open to a closed spyropyran form withenhanced acidity. This unique feature of the merocyanine-typephotoacids allows for the study of effects of the interaction ofacidity with these photoactive compounds. This isomerization can be measured using 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy. We also propose that acidity can be measured using a Lewis basic probe TEPO (triethyl phosphine oxide) that interacts via hydrogenbonding or protonation in solution. The purpose of this projectis to synthesize and compare the structure, isomerization andacidity of merocyanine-type photoacids in various solvents anddetermine if acidity can be measured using TEPO as a probe.This is useful for an efficient method to determine acidity of aphotoactive compound and study electronic and structuralfeatures of photoacids. Determining the Binding Affinity of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Fragment to Heparin Giovanni Lara Sponsor: Ph.D. Engineering Deans Office The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19 disease, has created mass lockdowns world-wide due to itshigh transmission rate and lethal nature. It is well documentedthat the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interacts with humanreceptor ACE2 in order to enter cells to start replication. Recent research [1] suggests that the glycosaminoglycan heparin which is also present in most mammalian cells may be able to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, explaining observed lowertransduction efficiency in cell culture when high amounts ofheparin is present. To validate this interaction, a SARS-CoV-2spike glycoprotein fragment and heparin are tested in silico tofind binding affinity by measuring the relative distances betweenthe molecules at various time points. Hydrogen bondinginteractions between the two molecules are also mapped forbetter understanding of the interaction. High binding affinitymay reveal potential in heparin and its derivatives as drugs toreduce transfection rates of SARS-CoV-2. [1] R. Tandon et al. biorxiv doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.140236. Environmental Burden and Incarceration at a Crossroads: A Quantitative Analysis of Incarceration Rates and Environmental Quality in the State of Georgia Alexandra Larman Sponsor: Clare Cannon, Ph.D. Human Ecology Intersectional environmental and incarceration justice data tools (ex. VERA, EJ SCREEN) highlight the intersection of these issueswith economic and social indicators. We seek to understand therelationship between countywide incarceration rates andenvironmental quality using Georgia counties as a case study.Georgia state suffers from disproportionally high levels ofincarceration nationwide (PPI). Using data from the VERAInstitute of Justice (2014) and the US Environmental ProtectionAgency Environmental Quality Index (2013), we employedbivariate correlation and OLS regression to analyze theassociation between county incarceration rate andenvironmental quality compared to individual-levelsociodemographic, behavioral, and socioeconomiccharacteristics. We found that environmental quality was mostassociated with incarceration rate (95% Confidence Interval [CI]=Beta .47), while all other variables also had a significantrelationship. Among Georgia counties for which there are data(n = 157), the association between county incarceration rate andenvironmental quality (determined by US EPA environmental quality index) may be explained by existing sociodemographic disparities and complex environmental justice issues.Policymakers should consider the intersection betweenincarceration and the environment when shaping incarcerationand environmental policy. Future research should include aqualitative analysis of communities at the intersection ofincarceration and environment quality.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 68Effect of Electrolyte on Aggregation and Bifurcation of Colloidal Particles near Electrodes Under AC Electric Fields Joshua Lau Sponsor: William Ristenpart, Ph.D. Chemical Engineering Colloidal particles close to electrode surfaces under applied ac fields have been observed to either aggregate or separatelaterally based on the identity of electrolyte solution. To date,there is no consensus on what role the electrolyte identity playsin determining the behavior of the colloidal particles. Wepropose that Asymmetric Rectified Electric Fields (AREFs),steady electric fields resulting from differences in electrolyte ionmobility, may make significant contributions to the overall fluidflow pattern in the system. Here, we use confocal fluorescentmicroscopy to analyze aggregation rate and height above theelectrode for seven electrolyte solutions under three ac fieldamplitudes and three ac field frequencies. We model theaggregation of particles as a second order reaction andcalculate a characteristic aggregation constant for eachelectrolyte and ac field setting. Finally, we demonstrate that thepredicted AREF strength near the particle is correlated with theobserved particle aggregation behavior. The Effect of Air Pollution on Voter Turnout Katherine Laursen Sponsor: Giovanni Peri, Ph.D. Economics The United States consistently has low voter turnout ratescompared to other countries, and there are a wide variety ofreasons that contribute to these low turnout rates. Voting couldbe made much easier by expanding mail-in voting and earlyvoting as alternatives to going to a polling place on a Tuesdayin November and waiting in line. Would voter turnout increase ifalternative methods of voting are more widely accessible? Mythesis investigates the effect of environmental circumstances,specifically air pollution, on voter turnout. This topic combinestwo main interests of mine, which are 1) how to increase voterturnout in the US, and 2) what are the social impacts of climatechange? Past studies have linked rainy election days to lead toa decrease in voter turnout, and there is a general consensusthat lower voter turnout tends to favor Republican candidates. Iinvestigate if air pollution leads to fewer people voting onelection day to avoid exposure to bad air while waiting in line.Furthermore, if turnout decreases as a result of these weatherevents, which voters are more impacted and does either partybenefit?Characterization of Defensin Protein Usage by Myxococcales During Development and Hunting Bryant Law Sponsor: Mitchell Singer, Ph.D. Microbiology & Molec Genetics Myxococcales are unusual amongst prokaryotes for theirexpression of defensin proteins, which were previously onlyknown to be expressed in Eukaryotes as an antimicrobial. Withan incomplete understanding of the role defensins play inhumans, our lab studies the use of defensin in Myxococcales'development and hunting to extrapolate the usage of theprotein for both Myxococcales and humans. Findingcharacteristic defensin-like cystine patterns in severalMyxococcales, our lab attempted to elicit the function andexpression of defensins in M. fulvus B02, based on RNA seq. After filtering dataand molecular modeling of hypothetical, orf, putative,uncharacterized, unnamed, defense and defensin characterizedproteins from the NCBI non-redundant reference sequencedatabase, we selected four defensin genes. Each gene wasexamined using knockout mutations via electroporation of thevector plasmid pBJ114 and cloning with E. coli DH5a. We alsoassessed the usage of defensin as a tool of the Effect of Oxidation-Dependent Autonomous Activation of CaMKIId on Arrhythmogenic Calcium kinase d) regulates numerous functions in the cardiomyocyte, includingcalcium cycling, transcription, and contraction.Autophosphorylation at T287 prolongs CaMKII d activity (autonomous activation) which persists even after Ca/CaMdissociates. This prolongation is associated with pathologiessuch as heart failure and arrhythmias. Oxidation at MM281/282,among other newly discovered post-translational modifications,was found to autonomously activate CaMKII d in similar mechanistic fashion. However, little is known about the extentto which these post-translational modifications affect calciumrelease in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigate the degree towhich autonomous activation of CaMKII d by oxidation at MM281/282 affects intracellular calcium handling, relative to theeffects of a persistently active phosphomimetic mutant variant(T287D) of CaMKII d. Using confocal linescan imaging approaches, we compared calcium transient morphologies, SRcalcium content, and calcium waves generated in paced intactrabbit ventricular myocytes loaded with myocytes beforeand exposure to oxidative stress (100 /uni03BC.1 M H 2O2). We found that oxidized CaMKII d intensifies calcium mishandling relative to control, especially for the T287D variant. We expect that thesefindings will yield greater insight on how CaMKII d oxidation contributes to cardiac arrhythmia development and on potentialclinical strategies for its prevention.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 69Access to Highly Effective Reversible Contraception at Family Planning Clinics in California Kathy Le Sponsor: Eleanor Schwarz, M.D. MED: Int Med - Genl Medicine Subdermal and intrauterine contraceptives are safer and more effective than birth control pills. California's Family Planning,Access, Care, and Treatment (FPACT) program offers freecontraceptive services to individuals living at or below 200% ofthe federal poverty level. To assess the proportion of FPACTclinics currently providing intrauterine and/or subdermalcontraceptives, we performed a \"secret shopper\" study of a20% random sample, stratified by county. Of the 2,200 clinicslisted on the FPACT website, located in 53 counties, we aimedto contact 325, and successfully collected data from 183. Most(61%) clinics reported offering both subdermal and intrauterinecontraceptives, 9% only intrauterine contraceptives(IUC), implants; 18% did not offereither, and 10% had staff that were uncertain of thecontraceptives offered. Among clinics offering IUC, 3% onlyoffered 61% offered IUC but were unsure of the type.These findings indicate that a considerable number of familyplanning clinics in California are not currently providing thesafest and most effective contraceptives. Further training ofclinic staff is needed to ensure that all Californian families haveaccess to the full range of contraceptive methods. Genetic Pathways that Confer Ralstonia Survival in Starvation Mode Hang Le Sponsor: Tiffany Lowe-Power, Ph.D. Plant Pathology A genus of beta-proteobacteria, Ralstonia consists of threephytopathogenic species that causes severe wilting diseases inmany agricultural crops globally. It has been found thatRalstonia cells can survive for long periods of time in a nutrient-limited environment in water reservoirs, including irrigationwater and natural water sources. Currently, little is known aboutthe biological mechanisms that support this ability. By creatingmultiple microcosms of three diverse Ralstonia GMI1000, and R. syzygii PSI07) in water, we are able to take samples ofdifferent strains of Ralstonia at various time intervals and useRandomly Barcoded Transposon sequencing (RB-Tnseq) todetermine which genes confer fitness during starvationconditions in water. Understanding these biological mechanismshas important implications for growing Ralstonia-susceptiblecrops in infected, and thus unusable, soil, including potentialnew methods for preventing Ralstonia infections in susceptible crops and enabling once infested lands to be used again forgrowing susceptible crops.Characteristics of Intestinal Epithelial Cell Growth in Multi-gel Systems Kyla Leacox Sponsor: Jiandi Wan, Ph.D. Chemical Engineering There is an increasing interest among researchers to engineermore complex intestinal epithelial tissue constructs for variousdisease and drug delivery research applications. The mainroadblock is the limited number of biomaterials with both themechanical integrity and cellular compatibility required tosustain the growth of these cells. Considering a proposedstrategy of combining hydrogels to mitigate this limitation, weseek to characterize the growth of intestinal organoids in multi-gel systems. We introduced a Matrigel layer with suspendedmouse intestinal stem cells on top of a previously gelledagarose layer of varying thickness and composition. We foundthat both thickness and composition impacted cell growth, withthe thickest (3 mm) and most concentrated (2x PBS) agaroselayer having the most detrimental effect on the expansion ofintestinal organoids. When a Transwell system was employed,the inclusion of an agarose base layer enhanced the speed ofcell growth and induced an elongated morphology in theintestinal epithelial organoids. These results indicate that theexistence of an agarose layer and its configuration influence thedynamics of an in vitro intestinal model, which was furtherinvestigated by studying the transport characteristics of variousgel configurations. Cyclases are Essential Regulators of the Myxococcus xanthus Development Cycle Kayleen Lederman Molec xanthus is a gram-negative soil bacterium that isunique in its ability to aggregate into multicellular fruiting bodieswhen cells sense limited nutrients. In a previous study, it wasshown that mrpC, a cyclic nucleotide binding protein, is anessential transcriptional regulator of the M. xanthusdevelopmental cycle. Cyclases are activating enzymes thatcatalyze M.xanthus has 13 putative cyclase genes that our lab has shown tobe active during fruiting body formation based on RNAseqanalysis. Therefore, I hypothesize that at least one cyclase geneis essential for normal fruiting body formation in M. xanthus. I am creating knockout mutations of each cyclase gene in M.xanthus and testing for changes in developmental phenotypes compared to the wildtype. Plating of two different cyclasemutants on nutrient absent TPM agar shows that they producesmaller bodies compared to the wildtype. This suggeststhat the fruiting bodies produced by these cyclase mutants arenot reaching full maturity, supporting my hypothesis andindicating that these two cyclases are essential for normalfruiting body formation.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 70Body Satisfaction and Social Eating Among Adolescents Elizabeth Lee Sponsor: Adrienne Nishina, Ph.D. Human Ecology Adolescents tend to focus on their body appearance as they grow older. During this time, friendships are also at the forefrontof youth's minds, as they navigate their personal andsocial identities. However, little is known about howadolescents' body satisfaction beliefs relate to their socialinteractions, particularly during food-related gatherings likelunch-time. In the current study, we drew data from alongitudinal quantitative study with 116 twelfth gradeadolescents in findingsindicate that were less likely to eat lunch with friends whenthey felt dissatisfied with the shape of their bodies (r = -.29, p = .03). In addition, among students who were dissatisfied with theshape of parts of their bodies, boys were more likely to havelunch with friends in person (r = .27, p = .04), while girls were more likely to have lunch with friends electronically (r = .306, p = .03). Final analyses will include data from additional school sitesand examine results across ethnic-racial groups. Thus far, theresults suggest that school interventions addressing students'body satisfaction beliefs could promote social eating for girls. Religious Body Symbolism and Sexuality Maya Lee Sponsor: Naomi Janowitz, Ph.D. Religious Studies Throughout history, religions have intended to create andmaintain order for the good of society. This order was widelyachieved through cultural norms surrounding what the \"ideal\"man and woman ought to be. This manifested in symbolic formssuch as gender roles, gender-specific occupations, and morespecifically, what society deemed as \"appropriate\" sexualbehavior. Many religions draw a symbolic connection betweenvirginity, especially female virginity, and the wholeness or purityof a people. Mary Douglas argues that in the symbolism of abody, all bodily fluids and imperfections can potentially beequated to a threat to society. Her theory raises an interestingquestion as to why unmarried women and men are vieweddifferently in regard to societal threats. My research willinvestigate the role of body symbolism in religious texts,contrasting the various symbolic representations of sexuality inpatriarchal, matriarchal, one-gender, two-gender, and multi-gendered religions. I hypothesize will beprevalent in both multi-gendered and single-gendered religionswith key differences such as abundance and societal puritysurrounding sexuality.Using CRISPR-Cas9 to Identify Genes Involved in Haustorium Parasitic Plants Root parasitic plants in the family Orobanchaceae can be devastating agricultural weeds. Our research is directed towarddeveloping a genetic based strategy to control these pests. Weuse Triphysaria versicolor as a model parasite for this familybecause it is non-weedy, easy to work with, and amenable tomolecular genetic studies. Parasitic plants rely on an organknown as a haustorium to attach, invade, and acquire resourcesfrom host plants. We have identified eight genes with predictedfunctions in haustorium development. To investigate the rolethese genes play in haustorium development, we are using thegenome-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9, to disable the function ofthese genes. We first transform our CRISPR-Cas9 constructsinto T. versicolor roots to introduce mutations in the coding sequences of the target genes. We then evaluate the ability ofmutated roots to develop haustoria and observe for anyabnormal haustoria development. This research will identifygenes and pathways necessary for haustorium development,which could be used to engineer host resistance by silencinghaustoria-related genes. Parental Emotion Socialization and Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents Jingqi Li Sponsor: Paul Hastings, Ph.D. Psychology Greater emotion dysregulation during adolescence is linked todepression, and parent's emotion socialization is associatedwith adolescents' emotion regulation. Using youth gender as amoderator, we hypothesized that girls experiencing morenegative maternal responses (NRE) would report higher levels ofdepression than boys, with symptoms increasing over time. AtTime 1 (T1), 220 mothers reported their NRE. At T1 and Time 2(T2, 2 years later), youth (M age at T1 = 13.67) reported their depressive symptoms. A regression model was used to predictyouth's depression at T2 from mothers' NRE at T1 and youths'gender, controlling for youths' depression at T1. Although NREdid not predict depression directly, the interaction between NREand gender was significant. NRE predicted increases over 2years in depressive symptoms for girls, but not boys. In line withempirical findings supporting the role of parental emotionsocialization as a predictor for depressive symptoms, ourfindings suggest that this pattern was only evident in girls. It ispossible that gendered emotions contribute to adolescents'emotion expression, or it is possible that boys are moresusceptible to their peers' emotion socialization duringadolescence.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 71The Influence of Climate Variables and Disease on Plantago lanceolata Survival Qiuying Liao Sponsor: Jennifer Gremer, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology This project is a continuation of a study on the globally- distributed perennial plant Plantago lanceolata that has beenconducted annually since 2016. Studying global P. lanceolatapopulations in relation to climate change helps to inform thedevelopment of persistence models. The protocol of Plant PopNet, an international project, was used to execute our study.Plant Pop Net aims to comprehend the factors driving the spatialdynamics of plant populations in response to climate changeusing data from P. lanceolata populations around the globe. Atour site in Davis, CA, we measured the abundance andphenotypic traits of P. lanceolata for five years. Data collectedincludes leaf length, inflorescence length, disease presence,and other phenotypic traits. We would like to investigate theinfluence of climate variables and disease on plant survival.Using compiled data, we will look at variation in precipitationand temperature to see if there is a correlation with yearly plantsurvival. In addition, yearly survival will be compared to theproportion of plants containing disease. We predict thatindividuals with disease will experience reduced survivalcompared to those without. Further, we expect higherprecipitation and temperature to result in increased survival. Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii as a Sustainable Platform for Insulin Production Pin-Ru Lin Sponsor: Marc Facciotti, Ph.D. Biomedical Engineering As the demand for medicine continues to grow, currentmethods of therapeutic protein production can be expensiveand unsustainable. Our project aims to genetically engineerChlamydomonas reinhardtii to produce the mini-insulinrecombinant protein in an effort to make medicine productionsustainable and cost effective. C. Reinhardtii is a single-celled eukaryotic algae whose chloroplast is capable of producingtherapeutic-grade proteins. Because C. Reinhardtii is relativelyinexpensive and only requires sunlight, low-filtration water, aninexpensive buffer, trace minerals, CO2, and a nitrogen sourceto survive, it is an ideal platform for inexpensive proteinproduction compared to current methods. We report ourprogress towards investigating the potential of C. reinhardtii as a protein production platform, and our progress towards geneticconstruct design and algal strain engineering with mini-proinsulin as our primary candidate protein. Currently we aredesigning our protein purification protocol for when we return tothe lab in person. The Algae to Insulin Project is part ofBioInnovation Group, which is one of the first undergraduate-run research organizations at UC Davis providing undergraduatestudents with collaborative and innovative research experience.Saturated Fatty Acids Decrease Collagen Synthesis and Function of Engineered Human Anterior Cruciate Ligaments Ryan Lin Sponsor: Keith Baar, Ph.D. MED: Physiology & Membrane Biol The ketogenic diet is a popular diet trend emphasizingconsuming low carbohydrate and high fat foods with manypurported benefits: weight loss, reducing cancer risk, anddecreasing heart disease, among others. Previously, we haveobserved that saturated fatty acids significantly decreasedligament mechanics and collagen content in in-vitro humanengineered ligament constructs. This study examines the effectof a high fat - low carbohydrate environment on in-vitroengineered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) constructs. Culturedhuman ACL cells were embedded into a fibrin gel, engineeredinto ligaments between calcium brushite anchors, andsubsequently treated either bovine serum albumin acid (PA, 16:0), glucose free BSA, and glucosefree PA for 7 days with refeeding every other day. Glucose freeBSA treatment did not significantly alter the mechanical andmaterial properties but significantly decreased collagen contentcompared to control. PA either with or without glucosesignificantly decreased ligament mechanics and collagencontent compared to control. These results suggest that a highfat - low carbohydrate environment decreases ligamentstructure/function. In vivo research is needed to determinewhether a ketogenic diet has a negative impact on tendons andligaments. Effect of Piroxicam, Oxaprozin, and Diflunisal prescriptionnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory that are used toreduce inflammation and pain. NSAIDs are now known to haveside effects on the heart. However, the effect of these NSAIDsproteasome activity in the heart is unknown. This projectinvestigates if these three NSAIDs can cause an effect onproteasome activity in H9C2 cardiac cells. The proteasome hasthree independent proteolytic activities, beta 1, beta 2, and beta5 activities. Proteasome activity was measured using specificproteasome substrates and proteasome inhibitors as controls.The preliminary results suggest that Oxaprozin decreases therelative beta 1 and 2 activities. Piroxicam and had noeffect on the proteasome activities. Proteasome modulation isusually linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) alteration in thelive systems, so the second method utilized was themeasurement of total ROS concentration in H9C2 cells bydetermining the fluorescence of Dichlorofluorescin Diacetate(DCFDA) oxidation. In both methods, each drug was tested withtwo concentrations that were calculated based on the levels ofthese NSAIDs found in human blood after oral intake. Theresults suggest that different NSAIDs may have different effectson cardiac cells.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 72The Benefits and Challenges of Digital Transformation of Commercial Banks during Covid-19 Pandemic Qiuying Lin Sponsor: Colin Carter, Ph.D. Ag & Resource Economics Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, SMEs (small or medium- sized enterprises) encounter many difficulties such as cash flowshortage, decreased revenue, concern about the instability ofthe future, etc. Commercial banks play an important role to helpthem survive during this tough period, providing financialservices and facilitating financial measures. However, thelockdown restricting people's travel requires the digitaltransformation of commercial banks. This paper analyzes threedifferent commercial banks in the world, Bank of China,JPMorgan Chase, and Credit Agricole to see how digitaltransformation works during pandemic. I investigate thestructure change, implementation of big data, seasonal financialreports, stock price trends, and digital products of banks toreveal the benefits and challenges of digital banking comparedto traditional banking. Additionally, to understand therelationship between banks and customers under digitaltransformation, I study the new communication ways and try toestimate the royalty rate based on indexes such as non-performing loan ratio, monthly active users, etc. Furthermore,studying the government and federal policy, I also analyze theenvironment for the development of digital banking. Optimization of Exosome (DR) is an ocular disorder characterized bymicrovascular changes in the eye. Our lab has previouslyidentified a set of microRNAs (miRNAs) thatmay play a role in DR pathogenesis and can be packaged inexosomes, natural carrier, and delivery vehicles. The long-termgoal is to develop miRNA-based early biomarkers and therapiesfor DR. The short-term goal was to optimize the transfection rateof a human retinal pigment epithelium (ARPE-19) cell line byexosomes and determine which cellular labeling is mosteffective. The concentrations of exosomes and the incubationperiod of transfected ARPE-19 were varied to determine whichconditions allow for the highest transfection rate. We calceinred/orange XL rate 0.23ug of exosomes 5-hour incubation period.Redesigning the Prosthetic Jonathon Schofield, Ph.D. Mechanical & As technology becomes more advanced, the quality ofprosthetics increase, decreasing affordability and deprivingmany of access to these devices. With an increase in the needfor innovation and cost-effective prostheses, our team is set ondesigning a higher performance prosthetic using sustainableand affordable materials. Working with a leg amputee directly,our below-the-knee prosthetic leg prioritizes comfort andadaptability for an active lifestyle. Our design is divided into 3main parts being the pylon, socket, and foot. We conducted aconcept screening to define the core concepts within each part.These include a vertically rotating ankle, self-molding socketinterior, and a shape that allows for full range of motion at theknee. We are currently developing the pylon and the foot of ourdesign by conducting extensive material and biomechanicsresearch to achieve optimal performance during the Gait cyclewhile walking and jogging, turning, and even going up anddown stairs. Throughout the process we will validate and verifyour design to ensure the client's needs are properly assessed.Once we establish a working design, we will create a CADmodel and proceed with the testing and prototyping phases. The Influence of Classroom Language Environment on Bilingual Language Proficiency: Mexican-American and Chinese-American Dual Language Learners in Head Start Mei Liu Sponsor: Yuuko Tonkovich, Ed.D. Education Research shows that classroom language has a role inchildren's language development with both monolingual anddual language learners (DLLs), particularly for children from low-socio-economic homes. The limited past studies that examineclassroom language have focused on Spanish-English DLLs.However, DLLs are a heterogeneous group and more researchneeds to be done with DLLs from other language backgrounds.This study examines (a) the difference between Mexican-American (MA) and Chinese-American (CA), (b) the effect of leadteacher verbal communication on DLLs' language skills, and (c)correlation between the frequency of English language andheritage language use by lead teachers and DLLs. Classroomlanguage environment was assessed using the LanguageInteraction Snapshot (LISn) that captures language interactionsof a total of 12 MA and 13 CA preschoolers in Head Startsettings. Each participant was observed for 5 snapshots for atotal of 25 minutes between spring and summer 2019. Eachchild's oral proficiency was assessed using the Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Oral Language. Preliminary results showthat teachers with CA DLLs spoke in HL more than teacherswith MA DLLs. CA DLLs also talked to their teachers in HL morefrequently than MA DLLs. Implications for educators will bediscussed.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 73Developing a Model for Community-Driven Single-Use Plastic Reduction in Local Restaurants Louisa Liu Sponsor: Andrea Schreier, Ph.D. Animal Science The presence of plastic waste in the oceans poses a major threat to marine ecosystems. Numerous marine organismsbecome entangled in or unintentionally ingest plastic debris,and yet, much of the population is unaware of theconsequences of single-use plastics. This project aims toinvestigate single-use plastic consumption in local restaurants inDavis in order to develop a collaborative model that can beadapted to support and encourage restaurants to transitionaway from single-use plastics in Davis and other cities. Thiscollaborative model would allow project stakeholders to usesocial capital to incentivize the reduction of single-use plastic inrestaurants through community promotion. We will conductresearch regarding conventional material costs, costs ofalternatives, how current businesses incorporate compostableproducts, and consumer preference for sustainable materials.By investigating the cost and process of transitioning fromconventional to compostable materials, we can determine thefeasibility of convincing local businesses to employ this modelthroughout the city. Investigating the Response to Health-Related Messages Over Social Media Siyan Liu Sponsor: Debbie Fetter, Ph.D. Nutrition In the US, about 7 of 10 individuals use social media to seek outinformation. However, this widespread use of social mediameans there is an increased risk of finding false information,especially for health-related topics. Message framing is a fundamental component of communication strategy that can influence exposure of amessage. Messages can be framed to emphasize either thebenefits of engaging in a behavior (a gain-frame), theconsequences of failing to participate in a behavior (a loss-frame), or the potential danger of not adoptingrecommendations (a fear appeal). This study will develop gain-framed, loss-framed, and fear- based health messages to investigate the response between apopulation with high-use of social media versus one with low-use. Participants will complete a survey about their social mediause, perceived level of knowledge about these health topics,and responses to these health messages in the differentframings. Questions will be included to measure perceivedaccuracy, how likely they would be to share the message withtheir social network, and self-efficacy towards behavior change.The results can be used to investigate how to more effectivelydisseminate health messages over social media to helpindividuals adopt beneficial behaviors.The Role of miR156 in Legumes Audrey Loaiza Sponsor: Neelima the microRNA miR156 controls thetransition between the juvenile and adult phases ofdevelopment, where high levels of miR156 promotes juveniletraits and low levels permit adult traits. My project will examinewhat traits are controlled by this microRNA in the genus Acacia.In particular, juvenile and adult leaves in Acacia are known fortheir distinct morphological adaptations to the uniqueenvironmental differences experienced during their life history.Using plant tissue culture and transformation techniques, I willtransform Acacia crassicarpa leaf tissue with Agrobacteriumcontaining constructs that over and under express miR156.Transgenic plants will be created using a protocol that inducesregeneration, shoot induction, shoot elongation, and rootinduction. Plants will be confirmed for transgene insertion usingPCR and will be acclimated to the environment by transferringthem to soil. Using these plants, I will examine which leaf traitsare regulated by miR156. The expected phenotypes arecompound, juvenile leaves in those with overexpression of thegene and simple, adult leaves in those with under expression ofthe gene. These findings will determine what role miR156 playsin leaf development in Acacia crassicarpa and given insight intothe evolution of leaf morphology within the genus Acacia. Does a Ketogenic Diet Delay the Onset or Reduce the Severity of Alzheimer's Disease-Like Pathology in a Lein, Ph.D. VM: Molecular Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent age-relatedneurodegenerative disease in the United States, andneuroinflammation appears to play a role in its etiology andprogression. We hypothesize that the ketogenic diet will be aneffective strategy for delaying the time to onset and/or severityof AD because it is anti-inflammatory. Evolving evidencesuggests that an intermittent diet (a ketogenic meal for one oftwo meals per day) may be sufficient to cause an anti-inflammatory effect. We hypothesize that both intermittent andfully ketogenic diets will improve cognitive function, decreaseneuroinflammation, and decrease histological markers of ADpathology. To test this hypothesis, control and TgF344-AD rats,a transgenic rat line expressing two human risk genes for AD,will be randomly assigned at 6 months of age to constantketogenic, intermittent ketogenic or isocaloric control diets. Therats will undergo behavioral tests to assess cognitive functionand then be euthanized for histological analysis at either 8 or 12months of age. Thus far, we bred and aged the rats to sixmonths, manufactured the diets, performed a preliminary dietstudy to determine the daily caloric intake required to maintainweight, and started the animals on the diets.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 74Assessing the Influence of Task and Working Memory Capacity on Eye-Movement Characteristics During Scene Perception Zoe Loh Sponsor: John Henderson, Ph.D. Psychology Recently, Luke and colleagues (2018) found an association between lower working memory capacity and longer fixationdurations. This study attempts to conceptually replicate theirresults while investigating the effect of task on fixation durations.Participants (N = 100) performed two tasks, aesthetic judgementand memorization, while viewing 100 real-world scenes.Working memory capacity was assessed with an operation spantask and a memory updating task. We characterized eachparticipant's fixation duration distribution by fitting an Ex-Gaussian function, which generated three parameters: the mu(mean of the normal), sigma (standard deviation of the normal),and tau (the tail). We then fit separate linear mixed effectsmodels with individual difference measure scores as theindependent variable and eye movement parameters as thedependent variable. We found significant effects of task for mu,tau, and mean saccade amplitude suggesting that participantswere moving their eyes differently during the two scene-viewingtasks. Participants' performances on both working memory taskswere not predictive of any eye-movement characteristic, thoughwe did find that the task participants are engaged in influencesfixation durations. Learning to Look in a Pandemic: An Exploration on the Impact of Masks on Infant Facial Recognition Jasmine Lomeli Aceves Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology From birth, infants preferentially look to the faces in theirenvironment. Across the first year of life, infants prioritizedifferent regions of the face (e.g., the eyes or mouth) as variousvisual cues become more or less relevant. For example, asinfants learn language, they may prioritize their attention to themouth of a speaker (Lewkowicz & Hansen-Tift, 2012). As aresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have become apart of daily life for many Americans, raising the question: willface masks affect our ability to recognize one another? Studiesinvestigating this question have found that adults are impairedat both learning and recognizing faces with masks (Carragher &Hancock, 2020). Given the importance of faces for infants'learning, we tested whether infants would show differentiallearning and recognition patterns to masked and unmaskedfaces. Additionally, we asked parents to report on their infant'sexperience seeing people wear face masks. To date, we havetested approximately 50 infants aged 4- to 12-months onlineand are currently analyzing this data to present in the Spring.This work will contribute to our understanding of how variousaspects of facial input are related to infants' learning across thefirst year of life. Cryo E.M Low-Cost Sample Preparation Device Andrea Lopez Arguello Sponsor: James Letts, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio Cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-E.M) is a well-establishedmethod in structural biology used to create 2D and 3Dstructures of macro-molecular complexes such as thebioenergetics proteins. A critical part of the sample preparationprocess requires devices that can cost over fifty-thousanddollars. While Cryo E.M produces accurate visualizations ofmolecules with the help of rapidly advancing computer softwareand microscopes, the sample preparation process has not madeas rapid advancements in technology. By improving methods ofthe sample preparations process can result in more efficientdata collection, and result in improved structure images. Insteadof micropipette transferring the biological solution to the gridsurface, the sample will be transferred by humidification. Thegrid surface is held by a pair of tweezers magneticallyconnected to a moving plunger. A solenoid will plunge the gridcarrying the biological sample, and submerged into a cryogenicbath of liquid ethane. The solenoid is controlled by thecustomized printed circuit board connected to the raspberry pi.A series of python scrips will control the signals sent throughthe device controlling the voltage. Upon completion this devicewill be able to effectively vitrify sample, while itself being a muchmore affordable and modifiable device. Understanding COVID-19 Vaccine Information Access and Hesitancies Vivian Lu Sponsor: Jingwen Zhang, Ph.D. Communication As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the world andwith new virus variations posing unknown challenges, promotingthe COVID vaccines to decrease virus spread and the death tollis a public health priority. Though the FDA approved vaccineshave been shown effective and safe, significant COVID vaccinehesitancy has been identified in research across differentpopulations in the U.S. This research examines the extent ofCOVID vaccine hesitancy across different socio-demographicgroups in the U.S. and its contributing factors. Through an onlinesurvey involving a sample of 1000 U.S. adults we aim tounderstand the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitanciesand the reasons why these hesitancies exist. In the project, wehope to determine if individuals are influenced by informationsources such as where a person gets vaccine information from,and certain psychological factors including political ideologiesand conspiracy ideation. Survey results will provide insights totailor health communication campaigns to increase COVID-19vaccine understanding, adoption, and adherence.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 75Impacts of Long-term Dairy Manure Amendments on Soil Carbon and Microbial Community Dynamics Mengmeng Luo Sponsor: Kate Scow, Ph.D. Land Air & Water Resources The application of animal manure as a soil amendment has the potential to builds up soil organic carbon (C), forms good soilstructures to support plant growth, and provides slow-releasenutrients for crops and energy/C sources for soil microbialcommunities. In a field study of a corn-wheat forage rotationover five growing seasons, we compared three manuretreatments with same total nitrogen (N) input: 1) 100% mineralfertilizer, 2) 50% mineral fertilizer, and 50% dairy manure, and 3)100% dairy manure. One-meter soil cores were collected at theend of the field trial. Soil physicochemical properties, soil water-stable aggregates, microbial-available C, C distribution in soilstructure, and microbial community composition werecontrasted at different soil depths (0-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm). Our results indicated that both levels of manureamendments significantly increased total and reactive soil Cstorage in topsoil while not deeper layers. Manure amendmentsboosted soil microbial biomass in all layers, and its impactdiminished as soil depth increases. High-level manureamendment resulted in a significant amount of manure-C inwater-stable aggregates. The findings of this study would behelpful to inspire the development of sustainable agriculturalpractices that support crop productivity, soil health, andecological resilience. Social Compensation or Augmentation: Does the Intensity of Social Media Use Influence Bicultural Individuals' Ability to Reduce Acculturation Stress and Bicultural Conflict? Stephanie Ly Sponsor: Jorge Pena, Ph.D. Communication The popularity of social media sites and apps has stimulated research on how its habitual use is linked to increases ordecreases in social capital, loneliness, and well-being. However,there is less research on how bicultural individuals use socialmedia to navigate their belonging to two or more culturalgroups. In particular, bicultural conflict describes the degree towhich individuals perceive tension between their two identities.This factor is correlated with their ability to shift betweencultural lenses, acculturation stress, social network diversity, andmental health. An MTurk survey sample (N = 725) was recruitedto explore the link between social media use, acculturationstress, and bicultural conflict. Path analyses indicated that,among bicultural individuals, intensity of social media use waspositively associated with acculturation stress factors such asincreased language skill difficulties, race-related workchallenges, perceived discrimination, interculturaldisagreements, and cultural isolation. In turn, these factors wereassociated with increased bicultural conflict. Social media usewas also directly linked to augmented bicultural conflict. Theresults supported the social compensation hypothesis as theyimply that bicultural individuals use social media to cope withsocietal pressures but in doing so, experience increasedacculturation stress and bicultural conflict.A Review of PFAS Effects on Animal Models: Reproductive and Developmental Health Impacts Anna Maddison Sponsor: Michele La Merrill, Ph.D. Environmental Toxicology Per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) chemicals are used in theproduction of many consumer goods and various industrialprocesses, and they have been widely detected in samples fromboth humans and animals. PFOS and PFOA have beencomprehensively studied and are being phased out of use, butthere are many other understudied PFAS chemicals withpotential adverse effects that should be considered inregulatory affairs regarding public health and safety. In thisstudy, we focus on how the reproductive health anddevelopment of animal models is affected by exposure to literaturereview presents the observed reproductive and developmentaleffects of these chemicals on animal models, which can be usedto help establish legislative priorities and draw attention tocurrent gaps in published research. Investigation of Substrate Processing in the Liver to Help Explain the Association Between Fatty Liver and Pesticide Exposure Anna Maddison Sponsor: Michele La Merrill, Ph.D. Environmental Toxicology Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects a quarter of theworld population and is associated with heart dysfunction,hepatic insulin resistance and increased occurrence ofhepatocellular carcinoma. Insulin resistance is especiallyprevalent in South Asians, but findings suggest this is notattributable to genetics or diet alone. Rather, increasedincidence of type 2 diabetes in South Asians is associated withhigher levels DDT exposure. A possible mechanism for thisfinding is insulin resistance due to increased hepatic lipids,which is supported by animal studies showing DDT causesincreased hepatic cholesterol, lipids, and lipogenicenzymes[MALM1] . In this we aim to investigate therelationship between DDT and NAFLD by investigating geneexpression patterns in the livers of perinatally exposed femalemice which could indicate altered hepatic lipid metabolism. Weexpect changes in RNA consistent understanding the mechanism of the underlying relationshipbetween DDT and excess hepatic fat we can make betterdecisions regarding future pesticide use and treatment ofNAFLD.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 76How Does One's Mood Affect the Processing of Words? The Effects of Mood on Top-down Versus Bottom-up Language Processing Neha Madugala Sponsor: Tamara Swaab, Ph.D. Psychology Mood can influence whether individuals rely on bottom-up or top-down mechanisms in word processing. We plan to conducta mood induction study to see how mood influences accuracyand speed in a semantic priming paradigm accompanied by alexical decision task that relies on bottom-up processing. Moodwill be induced using happy or sad music. The lexical decisiontask will have participants decide if the target is a real word orpseudoword created using internal transpositions. Theparadigm will have the following four conditions: related primewith a real word, unrelated prime with a real word, related primewith a pseudoword, and unrelated prime with a pseudoword. Anegative mood is associated with 'local' processing, so weexpect higher accuracy in identifying transpositions; whereas, apositive mood is associated with 'global' processing, so weexpect semantic priming to have a stronger influence. By fittinga linear mixed model to the conditions created by moodinduction and word pairings, we expect that the positive moodgroup would have a poorer performance but faster responsewhile the negative mood group will have a greater performancebut slower response in identifying pseudowords. These findingsassess how mood influences attentional mechanisms in wordprocessing. Use of Computational Physics Tools and Molecular Dynamics Simulations to Predict and Test Binding Affinities of Amino Acid Polymers with the SARS CoV-2 Spike Protein and its Receptor-Binding Domain(RBD) Rustin Mahboubi-Ardakani Sponsor: Daniel Cox, Ph.D. Physics The worldwide outbreak of SARS CoV-2 has highlighted theissue of achieving reliable binding of manufactured proteins toindividual virus particles (virions) both for capture (in detection)and neutralization (in therapeutics or prophylactics). Computational physics tools such as molecular dynamicsprograms can be used to test binding affinities of amino acidpolymers with the Covid spike protein in order to predict howeffectively mutant strains will bind to proteins in vivo, or howeffectively synthesized polymers can neutralize the Covid spikeprotein (and its mutants). Furthermore, these computationalsimulation tools can be used to predict how SARS CoV-2 willescape from antibodies produced in response to infection orinoculation, thus allowing us to understand how and why mutantstrains such as the Brazil, South Africa, or UK strain escape fromantibodies and increase infectivity. Here, we use the moleculardynamics program YASARA to run simulations and gatherinformation about hydrogen bonds, interface surface area ofantibodies bound to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, and inputthe simulated structures into HawkDock, a server whichestimates binding energy using the Generalized Born SurfaceArea method for computing the energy of solvation due toelectrostatic and entropic contributions.Part Preparation and Cable a CubeSat Freshta Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & REALOP is the first UC Davis undergraduate-based CubeSatteam with a launch scheduled for late 2021. Under missionREALOP, the Structures team has developed a cable harnessingmodel and prepared a process for manufacturing. Morespecifically, the parts preparation subteam is responsible formanufacturing preparation as well as creating validation andverification documents. The cable harnessing subteam isresponsible for acquiring cable lengths and organization for usein electrical wiring. For parts preparation, drawings of everycomponent as well as tolerances were made for use inmanufacturing. Then Interface and Control Documents (ICDs)were developed to detail how each component interfaces withone another during assembly. Mechanical Part InspectionDocuments (MPINs) were also created to verify if themanufacturers made the components correctly. For the cableharnessing subteam, Solidworks was used to provide areasonable representation of the wiring in the CubeSat in orderto obtain wire lengths. Drawings of the wire lengths were thengenerated for use by the electrical team. Both teams in tandemprovide a basic schematic of how the CubeSat is assembled,but more importantly also expose members to thedocumentation and practices that go into spacecraftdevelopment, increasing the efficiency of developing futureCubeSats. Operationalizing Social Environments in Cognitive Aging Research Pallavi Rachel Whitmer, Ph.D. MED: Public Health Sciences and built environments\" is a phrase commonly used torefer to social determinants of health (e.g., neighborhoodcharacteristics) that operate at the broad, ecological level. Whilethe \"built environment\" is clearly operationalized in empiricalstudies as physical surroundings made by and for humans, the\"social environment\" remains ambiguous. Theoretical andempirical definitions of social environments have encompassedvaried interpersonal (e.g., social network structures) and socialexposures (e.g., aggregate measures of socioeconomic status)that operate at different levels of analysis with presumablydifferent mechanistic processes. This scoping review aims toexamine how social environments are operationalized and theireffects on cognition, cognitive decline, mild cognitiveimpairment, or dementia. We performed a systematic search onPubMed and Web of Science using MeSH and keyword terms toidentify observational/epidemiological studies investigatingsocial environments as a risk or protective factor for late-lifecognitive outcomes. Of 7,714 identified studies, 85 met theinclusion criteria based on title and abstract. The findings ofthese studies will be contextualized within public health,sociological and gerontological theories of social environmentand will be used to develop a framework to advance the scienceof cognitive aging and risk reduction.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 77Associations between Age and Brain Connectivity in Sample of Adults Karina Mandujano Rojas Sponsor: Johnna Swartz, Ph.D. Human Ecology Studying the strength of connections in the brain can reveal important information about structural and functionalorganization of the brain and may help in understandingchanges that occur during aging. The goal of this study is tounderstand how brain connections change with age. Morespecifically, this study aims to test the hypothesis that theconnections of the language network will either strengthen orstay stable with age, whereas connections made by regionssuch as the sensory motor lateral network will weaken, giventhat motor control often declines with aging. A subset of 122participants from a national sample of Americans (25-74 yearsold), from the Midlife Development in the U.S. (MIDUS) Study,which is a national longitudinal study of health and well-being,was used to test this hypothesis. The study collected datathrough surveys, clinical, biomarker, and functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) data. Resting state fMRI data, whichallows for the examination of connection strength within brainnetworks, has been preprocessed through the use of a pipelineand is currently being analyzed. Results from this study will helpprovide further insight into how brain connectivity changeswhich age and how different networks vary in terms of theirconnectivity. The Effect of Rearing Environment Complexity and Depth on Laying Hen Jumping Ability Over Time Angelica Martinez Sponsor: Kristina Horback, Ph.D. Animal Science Recent legislation in California requires cage-free housing foregg-laying hens and it does not specify what the rearingenvironment should include, which has important implicationsfor animal welfare. Rearing environment complexity, throughperches and varying tiered structures, has the potential to affectfuture spatial and physical ability. Similarly, depth, or verticaldistance from the ground, could affect jumping behavior inlaying hens. Therefore, this study will measure the effects ofrearing environment complexity and depth on laying henjumping ability over time. The study design involved threedifferent rearing environments: floor reared, single-tier, andmulti-tier. Laying hens were assessed using a modified visualcliff, an added perch and platform, with three depths (15, 30, 90cm) being tested at three ages (8, 16, and 30 weeks). A randomsample of 270 trials where hens crossed the visual cliff wereselected for behavior coding using Observer software. Thefollowing behaviors were recorded to measure jumping ability:latency to achieve balance, wing flaps, foot adjustments, and tailposition. I hypothesize that laying hens will have better jumpingability with shallower cliff depth and when reared in morecomplex environments.Stereotypes Pertaining to Undocumented Immigrants of Color in America, the Damaging Effects, and Possible Radical Solutions Adamarys Martinez Sponsor: Daniel Melzer, Ph.D. University Writing Program Being undocumented myself, I'm able to see first hand howAmerica stereotypes immigrants, especifically those who areundocumented, and the effects that these stereotypes have. Inthis research project, I explored the different stereotypes thatvarious ethnic immigrant communities of color have had toendure and where these stereotypes come from, whilesearching deeper into the social, psychological, and economiceffects that undocumented immigrants have faced. Thisresearch includes experiences from Black, East Asian, and non-Black Latinx immigrants. I also included information on pasttechniques and methods in which immigrants of color havefought against these stereotypes and their effects, includingexamples of actions taken by East and South Asian immigrants.These solutions revolve around the practices of creatingorganizations for both immigrants and allies, joining and creatingcommunist parties across the country to find a solution to theexploitation of immigrants caused by capitalism, and using theact of civil disobedience to create desired changes. To gatherthis information, I collected and analyzed academic texts andliterature. Examining the Effect of Cultural and Prescribed Burning on Herbivory in Culturally Significant Plants of the Cache Creek Area Maya Martinez Sponsor: Beth rose Middleton Manning, Ph.D. Native American Studies Cultural burning is a practice done by numerous Indigenousgroups in order to improve the qualities and densities ofecocultural resources central to subsistence and spiritualpractices. One of the many benefits of cultural burning is thereduction of pest populations in plant species deemedsignificant by the respective tribe. This pilot project will buildupon past knowledge and both qualitatively and quantitativelyshow the effect of cultural burning on herbivory in culturallysignificant plants of the Cache Creek area. This will be donethrough interviews with the tribal and community members ofthis area in conjunction with the post-burn examination ofherbivory upon select plant species over different time intervals.I predict that interviewees will discuss the ecocultural andceremonial importance of cultural burning and highlight thedifferences between Indigenous-led and government-sanctioned fire. In addition, I believe that cultural burning willinitially reduce insect herbivory and increase mammalianherbivory. However, over time, both types of herbivory willincrease. This project aims to demonstrate the value ofTraditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in local landmanagement practices. Equally as important, this study willdisplay the cultural value of burning for the Native people of thisarea.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 78Mass Media's Role in Political Polarization and Its Impact on the Social Fabric of US Society Valencia Martinez Sponsor: Magdalena Wojcieszak, Ph.D. Communication The emergence of political polarization has been of great interest to many scholars in the humanities and social sciencefield because of its impact on modern society's social cohesion.Mass media is a critical point of study because of its informativerole in society and its capability to provide a platform to elitefigures who could be driving the phenomenon. Thus, it has theability and has proven to favor one party or ideology overanother. Nonetheless, we can understand political polarizationas the diverging of political attitudes to ideological extremes.This topic is usually discussed in the context of partisanpolarization of Republicans and Democrats and democraticgovernment systems. As a result, studies show that polarizationcan have negative consequences for democracy, politicalattitudes, mass opinion and mass consent, and even thepersonal lives of the mass media audience. This projectattempts to outline and analyze essential findings in this areaand provide proposed solutions for this growing issue. Racist Digital Media and College Students' Well- being In the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic Carolina Martinez Sponsor: Adrienne Nishina, Ph.D. Human Ecology In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, socialinteractions have relied more on digital platforms. Although auseful tool, digital media can also expose users to negativecontent such as racist rhetoric, especially as the COVID-19pandemic may have exacerbated racial tensions. The presentstudy aims to understand the relationship between exposure toracist behaviors online and self-reported mood. This onlinestudy drew from a college sample amidst the COVID-19pandemic. Participants were 227 students (35% White, 2% Black, 18% 22.9% boy). The findings showed that viewing aracist image of their race/ethnicity via digital media waspositively associated with feeling more worried, r (207) = .26. p < .05. Additionally, seeing others being treated negatively due totheir race/ethnicity via digital media was positively correlatedwith feeling worried, r (208) = .17. p < .05. These findings suggestthe need for maintaining safe spaces on digital media platformsand improving protections for those who are targeted. Thesefindings highlight the comparable consequences on collegestudents' well-being that may arise from witnessing racialdiscriminatory behavior, regardless of direct or indirectexposure. Caste and Caste-ism: An ethnographic study of the socialization of Indian expatriate children growing up in the UAE Radhika Marwaha Sponsor: Nicole Ranganath, Ph.D. Middle East/South Asia Program This study explores caste among expatriate Indians in the Gulfregion, a vital topic of research that remains unexamined byscholars. The discovery of oil in the Gulf states in the mid-twentieth century has attracted over 8.5 million South Asianexpatriate workers in search of greater economic opportunities.Caste, a 2,500-year-old system of social stratification thatoriginated in the Indian subcontinent, still largely influences acommunity's social status. Although in the 1950s, caste-baseddiscrimination was abolished in India's Constitution, caste-basedoppression, and consciousness, continues to persist acrossreligious boundaries. This study seeks to address: what role docaste and caste-consciousness play among expatriate Indiansliving in the Gulf? Education is a vital part of the perpetuation ofcaste identity. In the UAE, the presence of Indian academicinstitutions provides an essential space for understanding thesocialization of children born and/or raised in the Gulf aboutcaste identity. Through ethnographic research, this projectexplores the process by which privileged Indian students in theUAE see themselves and the world. Although caste identity isdifferent in the diaspora, it is still meaningful within newcontexts. Finally, it proposes an anti-caste intervention specificto privileged expatriate students in the UAE. Assessing the Impact of Acculturation on Attitudes and Behaviors Towards Domestic Violence in Arab Refugees Radhika Marwaha Sponsor: Patrick Koga, Ph.D. MED: Public Health Sciences Domestic Violence (DV) is the action of targeted violence on anintimate partner, a child, or someone else with an assuminglyreduced agency in the family. Often in patriarchal structures thatare deeply embedded in the two cultures of interest in thisstudy - Arab and Afghan culture, the DV victim often happens tobe a female. Despite being raised with these ideologies andbeing socialized into justifying and accepting violent behaviorsdirected towards them, victims living in the US begin learningabout American family values and legal protections that are inplace to prevent DV. Amidst their acculturation and assimilationprocess, victims are able to change their attitudes and startrejecting violent behaviors directed towards them. However,there are barriers to behavioral change that require the use ofculturally relevant interventions that can only be carried out withthe help of a victim-centered, quantitative tool that assessesboth attitudes and behaviors for a given demographic. TheABeT-DV Scale developed by the UC Davis team is instrumentalin filling this research gap and paving the way for changes inpolicy and practice for DV victims in the Middle Eastern -American communities.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 793D Coculture With Fibroblasts Maintains the Phenotype of Primary Rhesus Macaque Type II Alveolar Epithelial Marx Sponsor: Lisa Miller, Ph.D. VM: Anat Physio & Cell Biology Type II alveolar epithelial (AT2) cells are specialized cells that make up approximately 5% of the surface area of the alveoli.AT2 cells are responsible for the production of surfactant as wellas several antimicrobial agents. They also function as progenitorcells for the repair process after lung injury. Despite theirimportance to pulmonary biology, AT2 cells remain relativelyunderstudied because they are very difficult to culture in vitro . In a conventional two-dimensional culture system, primary AT2cells lose their distinctive phenotype within 3-5 days, whichmakes this system unsuitable for most studies. To solve thisproblem, we utilize a three-dimensional coculture systememploying cells. In this system,the primary AT2 cells are grown in a monolayer on top of aMatrigel matrix containing the primary fibroblasts. The contactbetween the fibroblasts and AT2 cells, in addition to growth factors present in the culture medium, maintains the sftpc + phenotype of the AT2 cells for at least 7 days. This model will enable further investigation into the effects of variouscompounds including wildfire ash and e-cigarette liquids on thehealth and function of AT2 cells. Investigating the Physiological Role of SYCP3-BRCA2 Interaction During Meiotic Recombination Kimiko Masaki Sponsor: Neil Hunter, Ph.D. Microbiology & Molec Genetics Homologous recombination (HR) is an error-free mode of DNArepair required to maintain genomic stability in all cell types.Breast cancer susceptibility protein, BRCA2 plays a central rolein regulating HR. In germ cells, HR ensures proper chromosomesegregation and creates genetic diversity through crossing overbetween homologous chromosomes. SYCP3 is an essentialstructural component of the meiosis-specific synaptonemalcomplex that mediates the connection of homologouschromosome pairs. SYCP3 is aberrantly expressed in sometumors and has been assigned to the Cancer Testis Antigens, agroup of germline-specific genes that are misexpressed incancer. Previous studies have reported a SYCP3 and BRCA2interaction which suggests a critical role that impedes efficientHR in cancer cells. However, whether SYCP3 has any role inregulating recombination during meiosis remains unclear. Iinvestigated recombination defects in a Sycp3 knockout mutantfemale mouse model since they are subfertile. Our preliminarydata suggests extensive delay in the progression of meiosisaccompanied by a significant reduction in BRCA2 function asindicated by reduced numbers of recombination foci containingthe RAD51 and DMC1 proteins. These results suggest thatBRCA2 and SYCP3 interaction might be important for properrepair of the programmed DNA damage that occurs duringmeiosis.Development of a Rotational Testbed for CubeSat Imaging Slew Requirements Billy Mazotti Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr This presentation discusses the research and development of amotorized rotation testbed to define reaction wheel slewrequirements in support of UC Davis' REALOP CubeSat mission.One critical goal of the REALOP mission is to capture clearimages of the Earth from low Earth orbit (LEO), requiring finelytuned attitude control from the on-board reaction wheels to limitmotion blur. This performance requirement was investigatedusing a microstepping motor to simulate a one degree-of-freedom rotational environment for testing the image quality ofa Raspberry Pi V2 Camera Module. Through varying thecamera's angular velocity, exposure, and ISO, images werecaptured and then qualitatively analyzed to determine therotation threshold that the satellite's reaction wheels mustmaintain to return clear pictures from LEO. Experimental resultsfound a maximum rotation rate of 20\u00b0/s and an exposure time of100 /uni03BCs at ISO 200 suitable for successful imaging efforts. While the motor step resolution constrained the rotational smoothnessof the testbed, this design demonstrates a low-budget optionfor student teams investigating CubeSat imaging attitude controlrequirements. The use of an environment more similar to that ofLEO, such as a frictionless air-bearing table, is recommended tobetter simulate unconstrained rotation. Pushed Out of Empowerment: Exploring how Latinx Students Experience Discipline at an Urban Charter School Andrea Medina-Castellanos Sponsor: Michael Singh, Ph.D. Chicano Studies The graduation rate for Latinx students in California has remained persistently low for the past years. Latinx students arethe state's largest racial demographic in both public and charterschools are Latinx, however, they experience disproportionateamounts of exclusionary school discipline, which negativelyimpacts school attendance and academic success. Thedisconnect that exists between academic success and thelacking of resources to support Latinx youth in the state ofCalifornia is alarming and disheartening. In my current researchproject, I seek to examine: 1) what are the different exclusionarydiscipline mechanisms that have led to Latinx students havingone of the highest dropout rates in California, and 2) whichsupport services and resources are necessary to aid Latinx inachieving academically in the state of California? In steps tobegin answering this question, I will be conducting semi-structured interviews with a sample of recent high schoolstudents who were pushed out between the ages of 18-20 froma charter high school in Oakland, CA. Through this project, Ihope to shed more light on how public and charter schoolscreate systems of punishment, which places Latinx students inmore harmful education environments.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 80An\u00e1lisis sobre las separaciones familiares familiar se centran en lasperspectivas de madres o los padres, que son repatriadospor autoridades migratorias a estosmenores/j\u00f3venes. Law Enforcement and Information Technologies: Examining Biases in Police Data Collection Processes through Modern Policing Technologies Jaqueline Mendoza Rosales Sponsor: Jesse Drew, Ph.D. Cinema & Digital Media Societal concern over police coercion and violence incommunities of color have brought law enforcement underincreasing public scrutiny. Criminology and legal scholars oftenpoint to a disproportionate impact police technology has onlow-income and non-white communities. My research focusesspecifically on data collection and information technologiesused in modern policing tools, to detect bias and discrimination,through a social determinist perspective. Technology is asystem that transforms inputs and produces outputs, a coreelement explored in this study is the process that shapes inputdata before law enforcement uses it in technological systems.By examining the practices and scholarship of policetechnologies, such as predictive policing software and facialrecognition, this study will investigate the impact modern dataacquisition and processing has on negative outcomes incommunities of color. Through a literature review, datainvestigation, interviews with law enforcement personnel, andsoftware analysis I attempt to answer some of these keyquestions and propose some solutions to the problem.Development of a Novel Small Molecule Inhibitor of Neutrophil Elastase as a Treatment for Pulmonary Diseases Molly Mermin Sponsor: Justin Siegel, Ph.D. MED: Biochem pro-inflammatory serine proteasesecreted by neutrophils, the most common type of white bloodcells. Many studies have linked high NE activity to lung diseasessuch as Cystic Fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, ChronicObstructionary Pulmonary AcuteRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Research has shownthat inhibiting NE can lead to improved outcomes in patientswith these diseases. Currently, there is only one small moleculeNE inhibitor on the market, Sivelestat, though several others arein clinical trial. Sivelestat has had mixed success, and must beadministered intravenously. We aim to use computationalmethods to develop a novel small molecule inhibitor of NE withimproved efficacy, and that could be administered orally orinhaled. We will generate a library of drug candidates and theirconformers, then study the docking of the small molecule intothe active site of the enzyme. Additionally, we will test thebinding of the inhibitor on different variations of the enzyme, toensure efficacy in different populations. This work willpotentially generate a novel drug candidate for pre-clinical trialto treat various chronic and acute pulmonary diseases. Tariff Uncertainty, International Productivity, & US Manufacturing Employment Shannon Meyer Sponsor: Giovanni Peri, Ph.D. Economics In this project, I consider the case of the U.S. manufacturingsector, which has reported declines in employment in the pastfew decades. I compare the extent to which regionalmanufacturing employment has been affected by productivityshocks from international partners, particularly China, to theeffects that can be traced to changes in stability of traderelations between the United States and China. Specifically, Iaugment a regional analysis of the effects of import exposureon regional U.S. manufacturing employment developed byAutor, Dorn, and Hanson (2015) by adapting a measuredeveloped by Pierce and Schott (2016) which captures the levelof protection that uncertain trade relations implicitly offered tocertain U.S. industries, which was lost after the U.S. extendedPermanent Normal Trade Relations to China. The results willprovide a framework for understanding the relative importanceof the stability of trade relations in local employment outcomescompared to the effects of broader international productivityshocks.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 81A Century in the Making: The Historical Context of QAnon's Rise and Spread Ann Meyer Sponsor: Kathryn Olmsted, Ph.D. History In 2017, an anonymous user began posting on the online image board 4chan, alleging conspiracies involving partisan politics andpublic figures in the U.S. These posts evolved into QAnon, aconservative movement founded on a complex web ofconspiracy theories. Since the FBI classified QAnon a domesticterrorism threat in 2019, evident in its visibility at the insurrectionon the U.S. Capitol, QAnon has gained footing in over 70countries and garnered international media attention.Speculation into QAnon's origins and rapid spread promptsmany questions, namely why did the movement arise andcaptivate millions of Americans? My research undertakes thesequestions from a historical perspective. By contextualizingQAnon and its ideas about religion, race, patriotism, class, andpolitics in U.S. history, I demonstrate that the movement is anew rendition of old beliefs and anxieties co-opted and appliedto present-day society. In particular, I examine well-documentedhistories of fundamentalist and evangelical Christianity, whitepower movements and fascism, big business's influence inmodern conservatism, and the politicization and weaponizationof conspiracy theories. I argue that QAnon and its ideologiesare extremist variants of more \"mainstream\" elements of theNew Right in the U.S. during the twentieth century. Mechanical and Thermal Analysis of CubeSat Structure for Simulated Launch and Orbital Environments Angel Meza Terriquez Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Space and Satellite Systems (SSS) club's REALOP missionis to create a 2U launch in 2021. TheStructures team of SSS has two analysis sub-teams: mechanicaland thermal analysis. The goal of both teams is to simulatelaunch conditions followed by a transient orbit around the Earthto verify CubeSat nominal operations. To create thesesimulations, the mechanical analysis team uses Solidworks withlaunch data provided by Nanoracks and Antares while thethermal analysis team uses Thermal Desktop. The thermalanalysis sub-team is in the process of preparing a basic modelof the CubeSat to showcase the effects of radiation on theexternal faces of the frame, as well as internal heat transferbetween the inner components/faces of the frame. This analysisdetermines if insulation or a material finish is needed, andverifies that the CubeSat survives in orbit. The mechanicalanalysis team performed 11 quasi-static tests; includingrotational, translational, and vibrational loads using restrictionssuch as remote loads to obtain Finite Element Model (FEM)mesh stresses and displacements that fall within expectations.The two teams replicate the conditions that CubeSat willundergo through the use of different software to simulatesensible mission results.The Human Right to Water in California: Gauging Drinking Water Quality Disparities in Marginalized California Communities Abigail Mighell Sponsor: Ross Butters, Ph.D. UC Center Sacramento Over one million people in California lack access to high-qualitydrinking water. This research investigates which populations aremost impacted by poor drinking water quality across the stateand aims to inform future water policy in California. Specifically,this research compares tribal lands vs. non-tribal lands,unincorporated areas vs. incorporated areas, and minority-dense areas vs. non-minority-dense areas. Through quantitativeanalysis of water contaminant levels by census tract, I foundthat tribal lands and unincorporated areas experiencesignificantly higher levels of drinking water contaminants thannon-tribal lands and incorporated areas, respectively. I did notfind a significant disparity in water quality based on minoritydensity, and I discuss possible explanations for this finding. Finally, I discuss the efficacy of current California water policyand how it can be improved to address these disparities. Thisresearch provides important information to government andnon-profit water programs that are currently designing waterinfrastructure improvement projects statewide. Identifying whichpopulations are most vulnerable to poor drinking water qualityin California will allow these programs to design more effectiveinfrastructure improvement projects. Parental care and the risk of maternally-vectored pathogens: Ammophila transmit Strepsipteran parasites to Millena Sponsor: Jay Rosenheim, Ph.D. Entomology/Nematology Extended parental care is important for protection againstnatural enemies but can also create opportunities for parents tovector parasites to their offspring via vertical transmission. Suchopportunities are occurring in the case of Ammophila wasps.They have varied offspring provisioning behaviors (i.e. differingnumbers of prey brought to the offspring), which havedeveloped in response to evolutionary pressure from non-vertically-transmitted parasites. The more developed behaviorsmeant to reduce parasitism may actually increase attacks onAmmophila offspring by Strepsiptera, which are endoparasiticinsects transmitted through offspring-mother contact.Strepsiptera are unique in how they leave permanent signs ofparasitism, visible even in preserved host specimens. We haveexamined thousands of Ammophila specimens from the BohartMuseum of Entomology for these signs of parasitism, therebyconverting the specimens into an extensive dataset with whichto investigate this host-parasite relationship. Preliminaryanalyses show that species with more prey items provided\u2014andtherefore more extended parental care\u2014have a greaterpercentage of stylopized individuals. We are continuing analysisby constructing a generalized additive model (GAM) in R toconduct more rigorous tests.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 82Chemical and microbial characteristics of olive fermentations performed at home Zoe Mitchell Sponsor: Maria Marco, Ph.D. Food Science & Technology Little is known about the chemical properties and microbial contents of food fermentations performed at home. For thisstudy, we investigated the home fermentation process forSicilian-style olives. In total, nine 1-gallon fermentations wereinitiated by six participants using the same recipe and samesource of Sevillano olives, water, salt and white distilled vinegar.Three of the participants prepared replicate fermentations. Theolives and brine were initially sampled every day for the firstweek and then biweekly for the remaining four months. At thetime of submersion, the pH was 2.6 \u00b1 0.1 and salinity was 62.8 \u00b17.0 ppm. The pH increased and salinity decreased over timesuch that the brine was replaced after 9 weeks to maintain foodsafety. Replicate buckets showed similar, but not identicaltrends. During brine change, two replicate buckets had a pHdifference of 0.2 and salinity difference of 5 ppm. Visualanalysis of brine surfaces also indicated highly variabledevelopment of yeast pellicles between all nine buckets. Thefindings from this study showed the variability of homefermentations, even when performed using the same initialingredients and conducted in parallel by the same individual. Predicting Subject Relevance using N-gram Extraction defined as a sequence of N contiguous wordstypically drawn from a speech or text corpus that are used for avariety of purposes, particularly transforming language into data,in the fields of computational linguistics and natural languageprocessing. The purpose of this research is to determineheuristics and refine a way to discern meaningful n-grams fromthose unrelated to the subject of interest, and be able toextrapolate the filtering methods to predict future relevanceamong topics within computer science. We define \"meaningful\"as having high correlation between the components of the n-gram (i.e. \"adversarial learning\" is a meaningful bigram while\"the machine\" is not). N-grams have been gathered and parsedfrom various technical abstracts, and used in the Google NgramViewer tool to gather usage statistics over time. We plan to usethis data in training an autoregression model to predict usagetrends in the next three to five years, to reveal insight about thenext big technological idea. The use of other models will befurther explored as well. Eventually, these modeling techniquescould be extrapolated to other subjects, however more workneeds to be done to determine how useful this tool can be.The Investigation of Noise Levels in Transabdominal Pulse Oxymetry Lilian Molina Sponsor: Soheil Ghiasihafezi, Ph.D. Elect & Comp Engr Electronic Fetal Monitoring (EFM) has been widely accepted inobstetrical practice as a technique to reduce the incidence ofintrapartum asphyxia by monitoring normal fetal heart rate.Numerous clinical trials have shown that, although normal fetalheart rate (FHR) patterns are a reliable predictor for favorableneonatal outcomes, abnormal FHR has low specificity in fetaldepression at birth, leading to a sharp increase in the rate ofemergency cesarean deliveries (Martin, 1998). Conversely,measurements of fetal oxygen saturation (SpO2) are shown tobe excellent predictors of fetal well-being. In this study, wepresent a fully non-invasive Transabdominal Fetal Oximetry(TFO) system that provides an objective metric to estimate fetalSpO2, using transcutaneous light measurements at the maternalabdomen. Measurements of TFO are performed by placing areflectance-mode optode at the maternal abdomen and sendingphotons into the body to investigate underlying fetal tissue. TheTFO system design involves a system prototype comprised of amulti-detector optode, embedded control system, and acustomer user-interface software. Furthermore, we investigatedpreliminary techniques used in spectral analysis to characterizethe noise floor of the measured signal captured by the TFOsystem, to further understand external noise sources. The Intercalation of Copper into Bi Sponsor: by intercalating copper (Cu) with other synthesis methods, electrosynthesis allowsfor greater control over the Cu-intercalation process andpreserves the structural integrity of Bi 2Se3 , reducing the probability of Cu-Bi substitution. CuxBi2Se3 is a prime candidate of being a topological superconductor, with studies measuringshielding fractions up to 50%, drops in resistivity measurements,and a hysteresis loop indicating a potential first-order phasetransition. It is of particular interest because studies intocompounds with similar physical behaviors have led topredictions that the low-temperature phase of Cu xBi2Se3 undergoes a crystallographic phase transition, with the details ofthe structure and stability debated. In this experiment,electrochemical synthesis methods of intercalating copper intobismuth selenide will be conducted and refined to producecrystals intercalated with high concentrations of copper. Thesecrystals will then examined under nuclear-magneticspectroscopy (NMR) to determine if Cu xBi2Se3 exhibits the shifts in resonance frequency that are unique tosuperconductors, and since these shifts result from theelectromagnetic interactions of the nuclei in the material, itcould also be used to analyze the material's structure at itssuperconducting state.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 83Hens in Backpacks: Does the Weight of the Sensor Impact Their Behavior? Rebecca Moore Sponsor: Maja Makagon-Stuart, Ph.D. Animal Science An increasing number of researchers rely on animal mounted sensors for automated data collection, but do these sensorschange the animal's behavior thus influencing the data? Usingthe laying hen as a model, we sought to determine whether theweight of the sensors (ranging from 3.3% to 7.2% of theirbodyweight) impacts their movement within a multitiered aviarystructure. We hypothesized that hens with heavier sensorswould have more difficulty transitioning between vertical tiersbut would habituate to sensor weight over time. Hens (n=59)were housed across six pens. Of these, 50 were individualmarked and assigned to one of five treatment groups (foursensor weights and a control). The hens were observed 1 and 14days after receiving sensors for 3 hours/day. We recorded thenumber and success of transitions between vertical tiers foreach hen. Preliminary results (based on data from two pens)suggest that the presence of a backpack weight impacted thenumber of transitions attempted, regardless of sensor weightcategory. The success of transitions was only affected on thefirst day of observation, indicating the hens habituated to thepresence of the sensor. Determining Relative Stoichiometry of domain-forming Coq proteins in coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthetic pathway is required to synthesize the ancient CoQredox lipid, which is an essential electron carrier in the energyproducing mitochondrial respiratory chain. Our lab recentlyrevealed that components of the CoQ pathway assemble intodistinct domains on the inner membrane, enriched at ER-mitochondria contact sites. We hypothesize that theseassemblies facilitate substrate accessibility for efficient CoQproduction and distribution. To gain insight into the unexploredstructural organization of CoQ domains in mitochondria, we willdetermine the components endogenous loci in budding Relativefluorescence intensities will be determined the knowncopy number of the focal-localized centromeric protein Cse4 asa standard to compare with Coq proteins. These data will allowus to determine the stoichiometric structure of CoQ domainsand will further our understanding of the nature and dynamics ofCoQ domains and their importance in metabolism.The Fascinating Role of Fasciclin II in Development of the Drosophila Neuromuscular in thecentral nervous system; consequently, proper synapticdevelopment and function are essential for perceiving the worldaround us, integrating information, and making effectivedecisions. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) possess key roles inthe establishment and maturation of neuronal synapses.Fasciclin II (Fas II) is a CAM which localizes to the Drosophilaneuromuscular junction (NMJ), a glutamatergic synapse. and NCAM2, proteinsimplicated in synapse development and Alzheimer's-relatedsynapse loss, respectively. I am currently investigating the roleof the C terminus of Fas II in Drosophila NMJ development. Ihave screened over 100 Drosophila lines generated by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, identifying several lines with mutations in theC-terminus of Fas II. I am currently investigating the effectsthese mutations have on the synaptic localization and relativeabundance of Fas II and several known regulators of synapticdevelopment through immunohistochemistry, fluorescencemicroscopy, and quantitative image analysis. Using thesemethods, I hope to elucidate the role of the C-terminus of Fas IIin Drosophila NMJ development. Capturing Insoluble, Unstable Titanium (IV) Species in Single Crystal Form Merissa Morey Sponsor: Alan Balch, Ph.D. Chemistry The coordination chemistry titanium halides, especiallyinvolving neutral L-type ligands and L-L type chelates, results in fascinating geometries, brilliant colors unusual for a d0 species, and unusual changes in Ti-X bond lengths. In spite of being a small, hard, highly lewis-acidic metal center, Ti (IV) cansurprisingly form eight-coordinate complexes with such ligands.These complexes are excellent starting materials for furtherorganotitanium chemistry and the synthesis of titanium-basedclusters and catalysts. However, TiX 4(L)2 or TiX4(L-L) species are typically unstable in solution when soluble, and more oftenthan not, intractable solids that do not dissolve in commonorganic solvents. A methodology has been developed for small-scale TiX 4-ligand reactions that result in direct formation of high-quality single crystals. The method has been utilized inelucidating the structures of several insoluble titaniumcomplexes that have evaded crystallographic characterizationfor generations. The variable chemistry of titanium halidestowards members of Group 15 of the periodic table has beendemonstrated. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 84Variation in Eelgrass Wasting Disease Severity Affects Consumption Patterns and Preferred Food Availability for Herbivores Naomi Murray Sponsor: John Stachowicz, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology Eelgrass wasting disease has been responsible for multiple die- offs of eelgrass (Zostera marina) over the last century. Despitemajor outbreaks, little is known about the ecology of thedisease, particularly regarding interactions between thepathogen, seagrass, and epifaunal species. I measured theseverity of wasting disease in Bodega Harbor and investigatedwhether disease alters plant susceptibility to herbivory. foundthat disease severity varies seasonally; necrotic lesions causedby eelgrass wasting disease were virtually absent in earlysummer but peaked at nearly 20% leaf cover by midsummer.This large fluctuation in the amount of decaying plant tissue maychange food availability for herbivores of eelgrass. Todetermine if herbivores showed a preference for lesioned orgreen plant tissue, I conducted feeding trials offering isopodPentidotea resecata a choice between the two tissue types.Lesioned tissue was strongly preferred. I used structuralequation modeling to further relate plant trait data to observedfeeding preferences. As plant lesion cover increased, thephenolic acid content of lesion tissue decreased. Phenolic acidsare a potential chemical defense against herbivores, and theloss of phenolics was associated with increasing herbivoreconsumption. This facilitation of herbivore feeding by diseasemay influence seasonal progression in disease severity. Interplay of Effective Surface Area, Mass Transport, and Electrochemical Features in Nanoporous Nucleic Acid Sensors (e.g.,DNA hybridization) to electrical signals and can be readilyinterfaced with electronic instrumentation for portability.Nanostructuring the working electrode enhances sensorperformance via augmented effective surface area thatincreases the capture probability of an analyte. However,increasing the effective surface area via thicker nanostructuredelectrodes hinders the analyte's permeation into thenanostructured volume and limits its access to deeper electrodesurfaces. Here, we use nanoporous gold (np-Au) with variousthicknesses and pore morphologies coupled with a methyleneblue (MB) reporter-tagged DNA probe for DNA target detectionas a model system to study the influence of electrode featureson electrochemical sensing performance. Independent of theDNA target concentration, the hybridization current (surrogatefor detection sensitivity) increases with the surfaceenhancement factor (EF), until an EF of ~5, after which thesensor performance deteriorates. Electrochemical andfluorometric quantification of a desorbed DNA probe suggestthat DNA permeation is severely limited for higher EFs. Inaddition, undesirable capacitive currents disguise the faradaiccurrents from the MB reporter at larger EFs that require highersquare wave voltammetry (SWV) frequencies. Finally, a real-timehybridization study reveals that expanding the effective surfacearea beyond EFs of ~5 decreases sensor performance.Examining Speech Toward Alexa versus humans: A comparison of adults and children Naina Narain Sponsor: Georgia Zellou, Ph.D. Linguistics Voice assistants such as Alexa and Siri are now commonly usedin the home and everyday life, yet our scientific understandingof these interactions is still in its infancy. This study tests howpeople of different ages (college-age adults and children, ages7-12) talk to an Alexa device versus a human. The interactions,conducted over Zoom due to social distancing restrictions, werecontrolled so that participants said the same sentences to theAlexa and human interlocutors. Subjects see a list of 24 wordsand, on each trial, the experimenter or device asks what thenext word on the list is. The subject replies with thecorresponding word on their list (\"The word is pig\"). Then, theexperimenter or device says the word back and asks the subjectto repeat the sentence; on 4/24 of trials, the interlocutormishears the pronunciation, saying a second word with aconsonant error (\"I heard pig or pick\"). Videos are annotated inELAN and manually checked. We predict that adults andchildren will show differences in the way they adjust theirspeech for a human versus Alexa interlocutor. Broadly, this workcan reveal the impact of voice assistants on language behavioracross the lifespan. What are the Roles of Pitch Variation and Word Repetition in Infant Vocabulary Development? Naina Narain Sponsor: Katharine Graf (IDS), also known as baby-talk, ischaracterized by higher pitch, longer word duration, a widerpitch range, and more word repetition in comparison to Adult-Directed Speech (ADS). Prior research suggests thatcomponents of IDS affect infants' language learning. However,we do not yet know how certain linguistic elements, such asvarying pitch and word repetition, contribute to infants'vocabulary development. The current study will investigatewhether infant vocabulary size correlates with parents' pitchrange and/or the number of target word repetitions the parentproduces. We will analyze audio recordings of monolingualEnglish-speaking parents playing with their infants (n= 24, ages:10-12 months) in a task designed to elicit 14 target words (e.g.,hat, apple, boat). We will count repetitions of each target wordand measure the pitch range for these target words for eachparticipant. We will collect infant vocabulary size via parentalreports on a standardized vocabulary form. We expect thatparents with high rates of target word repetition and wide pitchranges will have infants with the largest vocabularies. Ifconfirmed , these findings would suggest that certain characteristics of IDS can be targeted to promote betterlinguistic development in infants.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 85Comparison of Machine Learning Models for Image Classification Himshikha Nath Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The purpose of this project is to teach UC Davis's first CubeSat when to collect pictures and IR sensor data. The Space andSatellite Systems (SSS) Club has developed a CubeSat that laysthe foundation for low cost missions focused on Earth Science.This mission objective relies heavily on the problem of when tocollect data and ensuring the quality of our data. This isaccomplished through machine learning and information theoryand processing by the Computer Systems Team of SSS. Afterdedicated research, we have compared and contrasted threemethods for teaching our CubeSat: Linear Regression, LogisticRegression, and Support Vector Machine. Our results wereverified with mathematical optimization. We are developing anovel data set, which is highly sought after in Machine Learningresearch, to further test our methods. Future work will include anovel method that will not only teach the machine, but allow itto actively learn at low cost to our power systems. Recruitment Practices during COVID-19 From the Perspective of Institutional Agents and Chicanx/Latinx Students Yadira Nava Sponsor: Natalia Deeb Sossa, Ph.D. caused significant changes in the recruitmentpractices of Latinx/Chicanx students by the institutional agentsof UC Davis, an emerging Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).Using data from a study that emerged from an existingpartnership between the UC Davis' Strategic DiversityRecruitment Initiatives and Transfer Programs, the School ofEducation, and the Chicana/o Studies Department, I explore ifthe factors considered by Latinx and Chicanx students foradmission to UC Davis align with those believed by theinstitutional agents at UC Davis? We interviewed 10 institutionalagents from UC Davis and 20 Chicanx/Latinx students fromdifferent regions of California. Our preliminary results of theinterviews conducted with the institutional agents suggest thatthe most important goal of the webinar\u2014 as they believe to bethe most important factor considered by students in theiradmission to UC Davis\u2014was the sense of community. Thepreliminary results of the interviews with students suggest thathousing and financial aid were the most important factorsconsidered in their admission to UC Davis. As an emerging HSIinstitution, it is important that the intentional recruitment ofLatinx/Chicanx students employ culturally relevant approachesthat reflect the needs and wants of minoritized students.Galaxy Sizes at Cosmic Dawn Chloe Neufeld Sponsor: Marusa Bradac, Ph.D. Physics The study of distant galaxies and their physical properties canprovide important information about galaxy formation and thestructure and evolution of the universe as a whole. While theseearly sources of light are much more difficult to observe thannearby galaxies, their properties, such as size and luminosity,can help us gain insight into how the universe has changedsince its beginnings. Fortunately, with the help of thegravitational lensing power of giant galaxy clusters magnifyingdistant objects, we can get a detailed picture of galaxies in theearly universe. I will present preliminary results of the sizes oflensed high redshift (z>7) galaxy candidates from theReionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS), which uses datafrom Hubble and Spitzer telescopes. I will also discuss theimportance of the size-mass evolution of galaxies over cosmictime and the exciting future prospects of the field with theJames Webb Space Telescope. Effects of Seedling Age and Origin on Drought Tolerance in Streptanthus tortuosus Adrianna Ng Sponsor: Johanna Schmitt, Ph.D. Evolution & As mid-winter droughts occur more frequently due to increasedvariance in winter precipitation, California plants transitioningfrom seedling to established vegetation can be ensnared inconditions they are not yet ready to face. The timing of droughtrelative to germination-triggering rains, for example, may ruin ayoung seedling's chance to reach reproductive age. In thisstudy, I investigated how seedlings of different sizes respond tomoderate and severe drought. I also examined whether thereare differences in seedlings' ability to withstand drought basedon their source population and contextualizing these populationresponses with local weather data. To investigate howpopulation origin and seedling size affect drought survival, Iutilized ten different populations of Streptanthus tortuosus fromvarying elevations grown in three different age classes -- three,five, and seven weeks old. Over one thousand plants weregrown in a growth chamber and subjected to one month-longwatering regimes mimicking moderate and severe local droughtpatterns. I hypothesized that seven week old seedlings fromlower elevation populations would perform best as they arenearest to the end of the transition stage and have moreexperience with warmer growing conditions than their higherelevation counterparts.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 86Development of a Reliable, Low-Cost Reaction Wheel for CubeSat Attitude Control Dzuy Nguyen Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr This presentation discusses the development of a low-cost Manufactured Reaction Wheel (MRW) system for the REALOPmission, UC Davis's first and completely undergraduate-ledCubeSat mission. Commercial reaction wheel systems typicallyexceed budgets for university missions, so the motor andreaction wheels are independently acquired and joined with athermal-press fit to ensure cost-effectiveness and reliability.Once in orbit, the MRW will autonomously stabilize and preciselyorient the CubeSat so that the satellite's visible light andinfrared cameras can take clear photos. The MRW controlsystems team is developing a methodology to find a PIDcontroller which meets the mission requirements. This processbegins with finding a model of the system, applying and tuningthe controller, then verifying results with physical testing. Ageneral approach allows for testing on low-cost motors, inpreparation for quick and safe tuning of the assembled MRW.Many university CubeSat missions are hindered by the expenseof reaction wheel systems; successful use and thoroughdocumentation of REALOP's Manufactured Reaction Wheelsystem will provide future missions with easier access to low-cost, reliable reaction wheel systems. Characterization of Neuropathology Associated with Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS)-induced Status Epilepticus in Mouse Model An Nguyen Sponsor: Ph.D. (TETS) aconvulsive agent considered a chemical threat by the UnitedStates Department of Homeland Security due to its high toxicityand ease of synthesis. TETS causes seizures that can rapidlyprogress to status epilepticus (SE) by blocking the GABAAreceptor channel. The GABAA receptor is activated by theprimary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. There is noestablished antidote for TETS exposure. Currentcountermeasures include administration of standard antiseizureagents to control seizures and increase survival; thesetreatments do not protect against the long term morbidityassociated with TETS poisoning, including recurring seizures,cognitive deficits, and affective disorders. To identify effectiveantidotes for acute TETS intoxication, a preclinical model thatrecapitulates the neuropathology reported in humans thatsurvive TETS-induced seizures is needed. Thus, we arecharacterizing a mouse model of TETS-induced SE using theNIH Swiss mice. In this model, a single administration of TETSinduces SE in >50% of exposed mice who exhibit a seizureduration of more than 40 min. Our preliminary data indicate anincrease in astrogliosis and microglia activation in specific brainregions 3 days following TETS exposure. This work is supportedby funding from the NIH (CounterACT grant U54NS079202).Assessing the Development of Visual Short-Term Memory in the Preschool Period Using an Online Change- Detection Task Tiffany Nguyen Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is the ability to briefly storeand maintain visual representations during disruptions ininformation that occur during eye movements and blinks. Thecurrent study examines VSTM during the preschool periodusing a change detection task on an online testing platform(Gorilla.sc). In change detection, participants are presented witha sample array containing several different colored squares, followed by a delayed period (during which they have to remember the sample items), and finally a test array containingthe previously presented items and one or more changed items.Infants demonstrate their VSTM for the items in the sample arrayby looking longer at the changed items to the non-changeditems in the test arrays (Oakes et al., 2013). We adapted thistask and tested fifty 12- to 48-month-old children. Ongoinganalyses will provide insight into (1) how VSTM develops frominfancy through early childhood and (2) whether we can detectVSTM in children using an online platform. Measuring the Effectiveness of Undergraduate Teaching Assistants to Analyze Differences in Instruction in Chemistry Laboratories Angela Nguyen Sponsor: Ozcan Gulacar, Ph.D. Chemistry Beginning in Fall 2017, the Chemistry Department at UCDavis established a pilot program through which undergraduateteaching assistants, formally known as Emerging Scholars (ES),are introduced into laboratory settings to work alongsidegraduate teaching assistants (TA). To study the differences instudent interactions with the TAs and the ESs, every TA and ESwas asked to audio record their conversations during two labsessions. After the audio data were collected, they were firsttranscribed, and student interactions with the lab instructorswere coded using Laboratory Observation Protocol forUndergraduate STEM (LOPUS). Findings of this study will revealwhether students are more comfortable approaching TAs orESs, and how the teaching styles may vary between the two labinstructors. Student inquiries and TA's or ES's responses will becarefully examined to better understand the instructional stylesin the labs. These observations and analyses will reveal theefficacy of the Emerging Scholars program and provide insighton methods to enhance student learning experiences. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 87Does the Nature of Rotation Matter? Assessing Infants' Mental Rotation in an Online Task. Austin Nguyen Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology Mental rotation, which is the ability to mentally manipulate and make predictions about an object's orientation, is critical forunderstanding objects in our daily lives. Previous studies haverevealed sex differences during infancy, specifically that boysshow greater mental rotation than girls (Moore & Johnson,2008; Quinn & Liben, 2008, Lauer et al., 2015). The goal of thecurrent study was to assess how the nature of the rotationinfluences infants' mental rotation. We tested infants using anonline platform called Lookit (Lookit.mit.edu) that allows familiesto participate in studies from home. One-hundred-fifty infantsbetween the ages of 6 and 13 months were tested in a modifiedversion of the task used by Lauer et al. In that task, infants wereshown two stimulus streams containing identical tetris-shapeditems that repeatedly appear and disappear. On every thirdpresentation one stream contained the mirror image of the itemin the other stream. We manipulated the nature of rotation bypresenting some trials in which the items rotated sequentially(i.e., continuously and clockwise); the remaining trials were non-sequential and random. Ongoing analyses will allow us toevaluate previously observed patterns in mental rotation tasks,including age and sex-related differences. Can Women \"Have Anyone? Vanessa Nguyen Sponsor: Giovanni Peri, Ph.D. Economics As women's labor force participation rates have increased sincethe start of the Industrial Revolution, many women today striveto have it all: a fulfilling career and family life. Despite the factthat many women are full-time working professionals now,childcare and family expectations still fall largely on them. I uselinear probability models to analyze how women's lifesatisfaction is affected by the presence and interaction of careerand family, as well as how \"suitable for women\" their jobs are interms of presence of other women and relative wage gap size.Insignificant results so far suggest that careers do not play amajor role in women's life satisfaction beyond the imposition ofa time constraint that interferes with family priorities. Arobustness check on men's life satisfaction suggests that theinteraction of career and family is potentially associated with anegative impact on life satisfaction for men as well as women.This leads us to the question of how we can adapt labor forceconditions to better accommodate workers who have asecondary job of caring for a family in order to create a happier,more productive workforce. Capturing the Lived Experiences of Solidarity Between Latinx/Chicanx and Southeast Asian Undocumented Communities Jennifer Nguyen Bernal Sponsor: Monica Torreiro-Casal, Ph.D. Chicano Studies Communities of color share a history of colonization,oppression, and exploitation. American history has traditionallyerased the narrative of communities of color, such as theSoutheast Asian and Mexican undocumented communities. Theproject aims to focus on the concept of solidarity through theoutcomes of different movements throughout U.S. history,fighting for civil rights, and explore these movements among theSoutheast Asian and Mexican undocumented communities inCalifornia. My research is informed by historical movements ofsolidarity that documented communities of color comingtogether to fight for the same cause, such as the Third WorldLiberation Front. These movements fought for issues theybelieve in, contributing to current movements like Abolish ICE.Implications of solidarity between communities of color lead topotential outcomes that will uplift future changes by mobilizingand organizing to advocate for their community's needs. Takinga qualitative approach, this study aims to invite participants fromthese communities in places like AB540 and Undocumentedcenter at UC Davis to share lived experiences of solidarity.These findings will give a better understanding of solidarityinitiatives among these communities. Can California's Chaparral Persist Ph.D. Plant Sciences has evolved with fire, yet little is knownabout how increased fire frequency will change post-firerecovery, and thus the persistence of this ecosystem under achanging fire regime. Chaparral species have two majormechanisms of or sprouting from surviving root systems.Significant concern exists that short fire return intervals cancompromise both mechanisms, killing emerging seedlingsbefore they mature. This could lead to conversion of chaparralto grassland. I will assess the impact of frequent burns onchaparral recovery at Pepperwood preserve, which nearlycompletely burned in the 2017 Tubbs fire, and a portion of whichre-burned in the 2019 Kincade fire. I will monitor chaparral areasburned once versus twice and compare: (1) regeneration ofshrub seedlings derived from resprouting versus germination,(2) grass cover and biomass, and its fuel potential to carry afuture fire; and (3) the prevalence of ephemeral fire-followingspecies. These results will fill knowledge gaps in chaparralecosystem function which will be critical for predicting itspersistence under a changing climate and provide insight toland stewards seeking to maintain diverse ecosystem services,utilize cultural or prescribed burning, mitigate wildfire damage,or amplify post-fire recovery.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 88Latina Health Experiences and Perceived Discrimination in Healthcare Settings Juliana Novaes Sponsor: Erin Hamilton, Ph.D. Sociology The purpose of this study is to investigate Latina women's healthcare experiences and occurrences of perceiveddiscrimination in healthcare, as well as the associated effects ofthis discrimination on healthcare utilization, perceived quality ofcare, and general perceptions of the U.S. medical system. Thisresearch is motivated to extend beyond current studies'emphasis on legal policies and quantitative data, as well as thefocus on Latina health as it pertains to reproduction, insteadhighlighting direct testimonials of Latina individuals' experiencesand overall impressions of U.S. healthcare. Qualitative data hasbeen collected for this study through 10 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with Latina women in the Davis andWoodland area, conducted in English or Spanish through Zoom.Preliminary analysis of the interview data shows that mostparticipants have experienced some form of discrimination orvaried treatment in a healthcare setting. Many subjectsexpressed some level of dissatisfaction with one or moreelements of the medical system in the U.S. The goal of thisstudy is to highlight a variety of individual experiences ofLatinas in healthcare that can be applied to future anti-discrimination and implicit bias trainings, as well as policyresearch and changes for healthcare institutions andprofessionals. Increasing Accessibility of Healthy Davis Daily Symptom Tracker to Communities Bianca Eunice Nunez Sponsor: Prabhu Shankar, M.D. MED: Public Health Sciences The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has plagued Yolo County andSacramento over the past year. As recommended by the Centerfor Disease Control, an understanding of the symptoms of thedisease is necessary to take control measures and preventspread of the infection. The majority of the mainstreaminformation about COVID-19 symptoms only available in theEnglish language, and families with Limited English Proficiency(LEP) are left at a disadvantage. Creating a multilingual platformcan increase accuracy of symptom capture through thetranslation of healthydavistogether.com COVID-19 symptomtracking and important information about vaccination. Theproject information will be translated into the popular languagesspoken in Yolo County which will be compiled both into a digitallibrary, as well as into a pamphlet in English and other mostcommonly spoken languages. The symptoms will be depictedwith images and checkboxes. The commonly usedrepresentations of the disease manifestations will be mapped tothe currently used English terms, as well as SNOMED-CTvocabulary. If successfully implemented and maintained, thisproject will increase awareness, data accuracy, strengthenresearch, and encourage LEP population participation in COVID-19 public health preventative measures. The model could begeneralizable to any future threats by illnesses to public health.The Role of Collagen Composition and Orientation in Lateral Force Transmission with Aging Jed Keenan Obra Sponsor: Keith Baar, Ph.D. MED: Physiology & Membrane Biol Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and functionsto provide the mechanical strength of connective tissues. Inmuscle, collagen fibrils function both to hold muscle fiberstogether and transmit force laterally between fibers. With aging,force transmission and muscle mass are reduced; however, howchanges to specific collagen isoforms or the matrix orientationcontribute to force loss is currently unclear. The purpose of thisstudy is to compare lateral force transmission in young and oldpeople with changes in specific collagen proteins and theorientation of the matrix. Cross-sections of the gastrocnemiusmuscle were taken following strength testing to determinespecific collagen content, while longitudinal sections werestained with picrosirius red to determine matrix orientation.Fibrillar collagen isotypes I and V tended to increase with age,while the transfer collagen isotype VI decreased with age.Picrosirius red staining showed that the collagen matrix isoriented at a 22.3\u00b13.1% angle to the fibers in young and30.2\u00b18.7% in old subjects. By establishing the role of specificcollagen proteins during aging, we hope to better understandthe relationship between the extracellular matrix and forcetransmission in muscle and how this relationship is modified byage. Role of Parent-Child Talk During Book Reading on Heritage Language Proficiency with Spanish-English Dual Language Learners in Head Start Programs Yuliett Olivas-Gonzalez Sponsor: Yuuko Tonkovich, Ph.D. Education Studies in early language development with dual languagelearners (DLLs) have focused on their English oral proficiency.However more research is needed about their home language(L1) proficiency. Studies with monolingual English-speakingfamilies show that interactive parent-child book reading iseffective on children's language development. Use of Inferentialtalk has more cognitive demand compared to referential talkand has led to improved vocabulary in monolingual children, butmore research needs to be done with DLL children who may beexposed to primarily L1 at home. This study examines the typesof talk parents use when reading to their DLL preschool-agedchild and the child's responses during book reading time. Datawas collected with 15 Mexican-American parent-childinteractions while reading \"Frog, where are you?\" in their L1.Families were from immigrant backgrounds and the childrenwere enrolled in Head Start programs. All book-readinginteractions were transcribed and coded for types of utterance.Preliminary results suggest that parent talk varied in both qualityand quantity among parent-child interactions. Children's talkwas fairly limited across all parent-child interactions and parenttalk did not appear to lead to a higher total of children'sresponses. Implications and recommendations for families willbe discussed. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 89Assessing the Effect of Conflict on Affiliation and Self- Directed Behavior in Two Lemur Species Sara Ostad Rahimi Sponsor: Damien Caillaud, D.V.M.,Ph.D. Anthropology Conflict has always been a cause of anxiety for animals living in social groups. Those involved in conflict can deal with them byaffiliation and interaction with one another. Many anthropoidprimates reconcile conflicts which in turn decrease rates of self-directed behavior such as self-scratching or self-grooming, aproxy of anxiety. Whether lemurs handle conflict in the sameway is debated. We aim to address this question using over1500 hours of observation on diademed sifaka (Propithecusdiadema) and common brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus) in the Maromizaha Protected Area, Madagascar. We test threehypotheses, (1) the rate of self-directed behavior increasesdirectly after the conflict for animals involved, (2) the rate of self-directed behavior of onlookers not involved in the conflict doesnot change, and (3) animals affiliate more after conflicts thanduring control periods. Preliminary results suggest that the rateof self-directed behavior increases after conflicts. Together,these results help clarify how lemurs deal with conflict as a partof the costs and benefits of social living. Does Early Life Behavior in Dairy Cattle Remain Consistent Across Time? Vanessa Ostorga Sponsor: Cassandra Tucker, Ph.D. Animal Science Dairy cattle perform abnormal repetitive behaviors (ARBs), likebar-sucking, in response to limited feed availability. Thesebehaviors appear in early life likely due to frustration from a lackof natural suckling and foraging opportunities, and seem to varyamong individuals. They are similar to ARBs performed in laterlife, despite differences in natural foraging behavior in this ageclass, suggesting these behaviors may continue undisturbedfrom early life. We aim to determine if cattle show consistentdifferences in performance of ARBs across time, suggesting acritical period for developing these behaviors. In 2019, 24Holstein calves were raised with access to limited milk and ad-libitum grain; half received additional ad-libitum hay. All calveswere observed for 24h to measure performance of ARBs atweeks 4 and 6. In 2020, all animals were observed for 24h withfeed restricted to 50% of previous intake; a common feedingstrategy for this age class. We hypothesize that cattle who spentmore time engaged in ARBs as calves will spend more timeengaged in ARBs as heifers. We also anticipate consistentdifferences in the types of ARBs individuals perform as calvesand heifers, indicative of personality.Developing a General Microalgae-based Photobioreactor for From Municipal Wastewater Francesca Otim Sponsor: Ronald Tjeerdema, Ph.D. Environmental Toxicology Harmful algae are documented agents of large-scale fish die-offs in Los Angeles beaches. The algae, usually occurring asblooms, arise partly from increased amounts of nutrients comingfrom sources such as wastewater treatment plants entering theocean and causing excessive algal growth. The consequences,referred to as eutrophication, range from oxygen depletion inwater, to blocking sunlight from reaching organisms and tosecreting chemicals toxic to sensitive organisms. It is thereforenecessary to find ways to reduce nutrients reaching the oceanto save organisms sensitive to algal blooms. Recently, a proof-of-concept microalgae-based system was shown to removenutrients from wastewater released from a single wastewatertreatment plant owned by the City of Los Angeles. Municipalitiesattempting this approach have failed to reap the full benefits ofthe system. The two questions we are asking henceforth are: 1.)Can our nutrient removal prototype system be faithfully adoptedpredictably through the year by the same plant? 2.) Do thechemical characteristics of treated wastewater from three otherCity-owned treatment plants obey the models developed withthe prototype? For acceptance, our model needs testing andvalidation beyond one wastewater treatment plant. Technical Development and Assembly of a Modular Cubesat Mei Owens Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The REALOP CubeSat of the University of California, Davis teamutilizes a new design that is modular and provides more accessto internal payload components. To achieve ease ofaccessibility and modularity, the structures team designedmounting brackets and a unique printed circuit board (PCB)housing unit that are easy to modify and reorganize withouthaving to take apart the whole satellite assembly. The assemblypreparation team is currently working towards a standardizedintegration plan that carefully documents the process ofassembling each payload component. A database of well-organized and detailed documents was made to tackle themultiple challenges in developing an assembly procedure thatindependently integrated each of the critical payloadcomponents, PCBs, and wire routes with the structural frame.The assembly will consist of installing deployment switches,payload components and their respective mounting brackets, X-faces, Y-faces, Z-faces, and finally solar panels. These newdesigns and standardized integration documents will be usedfor future CubeSat missions and testing.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 90Therapeutic use of IL-20 Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibody Ph.D. VM: Anat Physio Cell Biology Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmnune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). We can mimic some MS featuresin mice through induction of experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE). Recent studies show that Interleukin-20 (IL-20) is a key player in inflammatory and autoimmunedisorders. Using the EAE model we want to elucidate theputative contribution of IL-20 signaling in CNS autoimmunity.There exists a commercially available neutralizing monoclonalantibody (MAB) for IL-20 that has been successfully used when delivered topically. We hypothesize that IL-20neutralization will ameliorate EAE. We pursue this hypothesiswith two aims: 1) MAB-IL-20 is safe to use in vivo, systemically,and 2) MAB-IL-20 will diminish progression of ongoing EAE. Our results using sham-immunized mice treated with eitherMAB-IL-20 or IgG control showed no sign of inflammatoryhallmarks in tissues (skin, lung, gut, lymphoid organs and CNS)and plasma. We also found that EAE mice that started MAB-IL-20 treatment once they exhibited signs of neurologicimpairment showed less EAE progression than EAE mice treatedwith IgG, suggesting MAB-IL-20 therapeutic effectiveness. Byunderstanding the physiological implications of MAB-IL-20treatment in EAE mice, we can further explore the feasibility ofMAB-IL-20 treatment as disease-modifying therapy for MS. Social Development in a Rodent Model of Maternal Autoantibody Related (MAR) Autism Krithi Pai Sponsor: Melissa Bauman, Ph.D. MED: Psychiatry & Behav Sci Alterations in the prenatal immune environment are associatedwith an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Herewe present a preclinical rodent model to investigate onepotential cause of ASD - maternal autoantibodies targeting fetalbrain tissue that are present in a subset of mothers of childrenwith ASD. Although ASD is a uniquely human disorder, animalmodels can be used to study the effects of maternalautoantibody-related (MAR) autism on social development,which is typically altered in individuals with ASD. In this study,rat offspring exposed to MAR antibodies throughout gestationwere compared to control offspring in a social dyad (SD). Onpost-natal day (PND) 36 (+/- 1 day), test rats (n= 56 MAR-treated,n= 28 control) were assigned to age- and sex-matched stimulusrats and tested together. Interactions were video-recorded andcoded to assess social play behavior within each pair byobserving the frequency of play behavior (nape attacks) duringa 10-minute test. We hypothesize that MAR-treated rats willengage less in social play and exhibit a lower nape attackfrequency compared to control rats. Studying the social playbehaviors of MAR-treated rats will provide new insight into theneurobiological consequences of prenatal exposure to MARantibodies.Increased Sigma-1 Receptor Binding Observed in the Pain Matrix of Patients Suffering from Chronic Pain. Parmida Pajouhesh Sponsor: Audrey Fan, Ph.D. MED: Neurology The (S1R) has been found to be an importantmodulator of signaling mechanisms in pain and inflammation,and its expression is upregulated at regions of heightenednociception in the periphery. Indeed, whole body [18F]FTC-146PET/MRI, a highly selective PET radioligand for the S1R, hasshown increased uptake at sites of pain generation. Healthyasymptomatic volunteers and pain patients experiencing lowback and pelvic pain were recruited. A GE SIGNA PET/MRIsystem was used for the whole-body PET/MRI scans consistingof eight to ten stations. The injection dose of [18F]FTC-146 was10 mCi, and imaging of the brain began immediately afterintravenous injection while imaging of whole-body (head-to-toe)began 40 minutes after injection. Corresponding static PETimages and MRI scans were matched, normalized andreferenced to the white matter region in PMOD 3.7. Sigma-1receptor significantly a collection of neural centersinvolved in both physiological and cognitive aspects of painprocessing. We can deduce that the expression of S1R in thebrain plays a role in pain perception and central sensitization. Chemically-Gated and Sustained Molecular Transport through Nanoporous Gold Biofouling Conditions release and replenishment of the drug depot areessential for the long-term functionality of implantable drug-delivery devices. This study demonstrates the use ofnanoporous gold (np-Au) thin films for in-plane transport offluorescein (a small-molecule drug surrogate) over large (mm-scale) distances from a distal reservoir to the site of delivery,thereby establishing a constant flux of molecular release. In theabsence of halides, the fluorescein transport is negligible due toa strong non-specific interaction of fluorescein with the porewalls. However, the of physiologically-relevantconcentration of ions, halides adsorb enabling in-plane fluorescein transport. In addition, thenanoporous film serves as an intrinsic size-exclusion matrix andallows for sustained release in biofouling conditions (diluteserum). The molecular release is reproducibly controlled bygating it in response to the presence of halides at the reservoir(source) and the release site (sink) without external triggers (e.g.,electrical, mechanical).UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 91A Comparative Genomic Analysis of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles Gregory Lanzaro, Ph.D. sub-Saharan Africa, Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii are the principal vectors of malaria, a deadly mosquito-borne disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium spp. These mosquitoes are closely related sister species in the An.gambiae complex that are morphologically indistinguishable.Population genomics has become a key component indifferentiating An. gambiae mosquitoes and understanding their migration patterns. This species has a broad distributionspanning continental sub-Saharan Africa and surroundingAfrican islands. Islands are model ecosystems for studying manyspecies, including An. gambiae spp. mosquitoes. Their simplified biotas, small landmass, geological youth, and distance andisolation from the mainland make up the foundation of islandbiogeography theory which correlates these features withspecies richness and abundance. The aim of this study is thegenetic characterization of An. gambiae and An. coluzzii islandpopulations in terms of nucleotide diversity, effective populationsize, and demography, and their correlation with geologicalhistory and environmental features. A genomic data analysis willbe conducted on individual whole genome sequences using asuite of bioinformatics tools. The generated data will beinterpreted in the context of ecological and geologicalinformation assembled from existing island scientific literaturedatabases. Identifying Trends in Research and Technology using Natural Language Processing Zhengtong Pan Sponsor: Setareh Rafatirad, Ph.D. Engr Computer Science This paper discusses the idea of using natural languageprocessing to identify trends in technological research anddevelopment by extracting key terms and their semanticmeanings from publication titles and text corpus. We processedthe texts by training a Word2Vec model to extract key terms, orn-grams, from a text corpus composed of Google Scholardocuments. The key terms are then correlated with temporaldata and a label obtained from the Gartner's Hype Cycle for\"Emerging Technologies'' in order to identify trends between atechnology's popularity and research and developmentprogress. We select a classification model to classify thedocument's topic in a technological domain, and then use a timeseries model to predict the trend of a specific document withinthe technological domain. We present experimental resultsexploring the feasibility of developing a recommendationsystem to help guide researchers in selecting new technologiesand domains for their research purposes.Talking to Babies: Does What You Say Matter? Grace Paniccia Sponsor: Katharine Graf Estes, Ph.D. Psychology It seems instinctive for adults to use infant-directed speech (IDS)when speaking to infants\u2014they raise their pitch, slow theirspeech, and exaggerate their intonation. Acoustic features haveshown significant impacts on infant word-learning (Ma et al.,2011), but elaboration may also play a role. While a study hasshown that repeating words facilitates word-learning (Maura etal., 2020), elaboration could also be important for languageacquisition by exposing infants to the context of words. Thisstudy will examine the difference between repetition andelaboration of IDS and its relationship to infants' vocabularydevelopment. Twenty American-English speaking parent-childdyads participated in a set of interactive tasks that containedobjects labelled with target words. Audio recordings will beanalyzed for the frequencies of target words spoken (e.g. cow)and additional descriptors used per object (e.g. \"cows makemilk\"). We also collected parental reports of infant vocabularysize. We predict that infants whose parents use additionaldescriptors will have larger vocabularies than infants whoseparents use more isolated repetitions of target words. Wepropose that elaborations are important because it diversifiesword exposure. Understanding the role of repetition andelaboration in IDS is important because they may facilitate infantlanguage acquisition. An In Vitro Investigation of Plant-Derived Prebiotics and Their Effects on the Ruminant Gut Microbiome Yuna Park Sponsor: Matthias Hess, Ph.D. Animal Science The ecology of the gut microbiome is associated with amultitude of metabolic and immunological processes that arevital to host health and function. In the livestock sector, therehas been a growing interest in identifying compounds thattarget and modulate the gut microbiota to direct the gutmetabolism towards more productive animals and,consequently, towards sustainable animal agriculture. For thisproject, we will be investigating four different plant-derivedprebiotics for their potential to alter the composition andfunction of the microbial community in the rumen. To test ourhypothesis that gut function and host health can be altered andimproved by these compounds, we will utilize an artificial rumensystem and determine changes in gas production (CH 4 and CO2) in response to the addition of prebiotic compounds. Results from these engineered systems will enable us to identifythe most promising candidates for subsequent in vivo trialswithout the need to expose animals to these compounds in theinitial testing period. While results from this work will provide first insights into the health benefits of selected plant-derived compounds for improving the health and performance ofruminant animals, we plan to expand our work to includeadditional compounds and other gut systems.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 92Investigating the role of Grb10 promoter hypermethylation Microbiology & Molec Genetics Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death with a 10% of 5-year survival rate in the United States. This islargely due to early dissemination and late diagnosis. Recentstudies suggest that pancreatic cancer metastasis can be drivenby epigenetic factors, such as occurs at cytosines, is catalyzed by DNAmethyltransferases (DNMTs), and is associated with geneinactivation when at promoters. Reduced representation bisulfitesequencing experiments using organoid models of pancreaticcancer progression reveal that a number of gene promoterregions are hypermethylated in a growth factor receptor-binding protein whoseoverexpression has been shown to suppress growth. BecauseGrb10 is hypermethylated and downregulated in metastaticorganoids, I hypothesize that of Grb10promoter is responsible for down-regulation of Grb10. Using thedCas9-DNMT3a fusion protein system to target specificcytosines with guide RNAs, I am specifically methylating theGrb10 promoter in pancreatic cancer tumor cells to analyze itseffect on downregulation of gene expression and metastaticcharacters such as anchorage-independent growth and cellularmigration/invasion. The results will likely provide further insightinto the potential relationship between Grb10 and metastatic behavior. Psychoplastogens as Therapeutics for Patel Sponsor: David Olson, Ph.D. Chemistry Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects nearly 6 million Americans butthere are currently no effective therapeutics to stop or reversethe progression of this disease. Neuronal atrophy and theformation of amyloid-\u00df plaques in the cortex and hippocampusplay a key role in the pathophysiology of AD, resulting in severeimpairment in memory and cognition. The Olson Lab hasdemonstrated that psychoplastogens\u2014compounds capable ofrapidly and functional and loss synapses through activation of growth and survivalpathways. In this study, our overall objective was to assess theefficacy of psychoplastogens and non-hallucinogenic analogs incellular models of molecularbiology assays used to measure dendritic arbor complexity,spine density, and cell viability, our results show reduce dendritic atrophy caused by amyloid-\u00df 1-42 oligomers treatment increases theresilience of these cells to A\u00df1-42 insult. This demonstrates thatpsychoplastogens may be a novel therapeutic strategy for thetreatment of this common and devastating disease. Relation between Parent Perception of Child Emotion Regulation and Parenting Behavior Bhakti Patwardhan Sponsor: Camelia Hostinar Caudill, regulation is related to parentalbehaviors and perceptions, existing evidence is mixed (Meyer etal., 2014; Shannon, 2011). This study investigates the linkbetween parent perceptions of child emotion regulation andparenting. One-hundred and nineteen children (x? age = 9.9, SD= 0.58, 49.6% female) were randomized into two groups:receiving parent support before a modified Trier Social StressTest (TSST-M) (N = 56), or preparing alone (N = 63). Parentscompleted the Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC) about theirchild and were videotaped during the preparation. Following theTSST-M, children rated their state anxiety (STAI-C) and howhelpful their parents were. ERC was negatively correlated withSTAI-C, r(117) = -.25, p = .01, but not with observed parent validation (r(54) =.11, p = .42) or involvement (r(54) = -.12, p = .37). There were no significant gender differences (p-values > 0.20).Parents' perception of how well their child regulates emotionswas consistent with children's reported stress, but not related toparenting behavior during preparation period. ERC waspositively correlated with children's ratings of parent-helpfulness, r(60) = .41, p = .001, suggesting parents enlist different types of encouragement based on their perception oftheir child's emotion regulation. CAMPFIRES, COURTSHIP, AND COVERED WAGONS: THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL WORLD OF THE OVERLAND TRAILS Joy Pedersen Sponsor: Rachel St John, Ph.D. History Over 250,000 people traveled west on the Overland Trailduring the mid-nineteenth century. This large number ofemigrants moving westward in search of fortune and farmlandmeant more opportunities for interaction than previouslyavailable in the daily lives of Midwest farmers, especially forwomen. As overlanders rode in wagons westward, they carriedtheir culture with them while embracing the freedom andflexibility offered by trail life. Building on the work of historianswho have emphasized the distinct experiences of men andwomen and gendered divisions of labor on the Overland Trails, Iexamine the social life of overlanders to better understand howmigration impacted their friendships and romantic relationships,as well as how they worshiped, celebrated, danced, and played.My research examines the emotional and relational nature ofcrossing the plains, the transmission of tradition and culture, aswell as newfound freedom in the mobility of the trail. Based onanalysis of women's overland trail diaries and memoirs spanning from 1840 to 1865, I demonstrate the importance of culture and connection in crossing the continent.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 93The Mechanisms of Social Approach and Social Vigilance in California Mice Lilian Pelattini Sponsor: Brian Trainor, Ph.D. Psychology Anxiety disorders are characterized by behavioral inhibitions such as increased arousal and social avoidance. The underlyingmechanisms for these behaviors are unknown and manyindividuals do not respond to current treatments. Becausesocial anxiety is more prevalent in women, our studies use theCalifornia mouse social defeat model that induces severalanxiety-like symptoms in females versus males. During socialinteraction, stressed female California mice orient towards anunfamiliar mouse without approaching it, a behavior defined associal vigilance. In contrast, social approach is when a mouseinteracts with an unfamiliar mouse. In this project, we examinedthe mechanisms of these responses and their relation tobehaviors in other contexts. A stressed mouse is acclimated to anovel cage and a same-sex juvenile mouse is then introduced.Stressed female mice showed an increase in autogroomingwhen transferred to a new cage, which is expected as thisoccurs in the social defeat model. The stressed females alsoshowed higher levels of freezing, a behavioral response to aperceived threat, after the juvenile female mouse wasintroduced. We found that autogrooming, not freezing, ispositively correlated with social vigilance. These results suggestthat circuits modulating social approach and social vigilance aredistinct. The Influence of Climate Variables and Disease on Plantago lanceolata Survival Sophia Pelletier Sponsor: Jennifer Gremer, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology This project is a continuation of a study on the globally-distributed perennial plant Plantago lanceolata that has beenconducted annually since 2016. Studying global P. lanceolatapopulations in relation to climate change helps to inform thedevelopment of persistence models. The protocol of Plant PopNet, an international project, was used to execute our study.Plant Pop Net aims to comprehend the factors driving the spatialdynamics of plant populations in response to climate changeusing data from P. lanceolata populations around the globe. Atour site in Davis, CA, we measured the abundance andphenotypic traits of P. lanceolata for five years. Data collectedincludes leaf length, inflorescence length, disease presence,and other phenotypic traits. We would like to investigate theinfluence of climate variables and disease on plant survival.Using compiled data, we will look at variation in precipitationand temperature to see if there is a correlation with yearly plantsurvival. In addition, yearly survival will be compared to theproportion of plants containing disease. We predict thatindividuals with disease will experience reduced survivalcompared to those without. Further, we expect higherprecipitation and temperature to result in increased survival.The Burden of French Multiculturalism Mazarine-Claire Penzin Sponsor: Jeannette Money, Ph.D. Political Science To better understand the impact of la\u00efcit\u00e9 (secularism) and itspolicies on French minorities, this paper traces the effects oftightening secular policies on the minority experience in Frenchsociety, specifically for French Muslim women. From work doneby Aala Abdelgadir and Vasiliki Fouka (2020), there alreadyexists an established connection between the 2010 Frenchsecular law banning the wearing of the niqab and theexperiences and feelings of Frenchness of minorities in France.This paper takes the research a step further, looking at secularlegislation in France from 1989 to 2010 and tracing their directand indirect effects on the Muslim experience in France byanalyzing two main channels of effects: the disrciminationchannel and identity channel. While the assessment of the datasets are still in progress, current findings seem to suggest thatimpacts of the legislation has increased over time as a result ofsecular policies becoming more severe. Such findings arecrucial for determining whether France's approach to itssociety's multiculturalism has had adverse effects on itspopulation, and if a new course of action should be adopted bypolicymakers. Activated BHB Species Capable of Post-Translational Modification of BHBylation Sawyer Peralta Ph.D. MED: the metabolism of fatty acids to produceketone bodies: circulating energy carriers that can substitute forglucose to provide cellular energy under conditions such asfasting, exercise, or low carbohydrate intake. Ketogenesis hasbeen associated with various health benefits in rodentsincluding extended lifespan, reduction in cancer progression,and improved memory. BHB is the most abundant ketone bodyin mammals and can post-translationally modify proteins by aprocess known as BHBylation, which affects protein function.Similar modifications, such as acetylation, are controlled byacyltransferase enzymes but can occur non-enzymatically aswell. The molecular mechanism underlying BHBylation ofprotein lysines is not yet characterized. This project whether BHB can non-enzymatically modify proteins.Human serum albumin BHB species (BHB-Na+, BHB-CoA, and BHB-SNAC) under physiological temperature and pH for increasingincubation periods. Samples were analyzed via Western blotsusing a primary antibody against lysine BHBylation. My resultsshowed a time- and dose-dependent with the activated thioester species BHB-CoA andBHB-SNAC, but not with BHB-Na+. These results indicate thatthioester of the ketone body BHB can non-enzymaticallyBHBylate lysine residues.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 94Examining the Quantitative Extent of DNA Metabarcoding for San Francisco Estuary Species Monitoring Using a Mock Community Serra Perry Sponsor: Andrea Schreier, Ph.D. Animal Science The San Francisco Estuary (SFE) is a biodiverse and ecologically significant habitat presenting the need for early detection ofpotentially invasive species such as zebra mussels, andmonitoring of listed or rare species such as delta smelt. Asuggested management method is environmental DNAmetabarcoding which simultaneously identifies genetic materialof species in environmental samples using primers. Primersisolate identifying regions of DNA called barcodes to amplify forsequencing. However, mismatches between primers and DNAtemplates influence relative sequence read abundance and canlead to altered taxon representation. This project investigateswhether species abundance in the SFE can be estimated withsequence abundance given primer bias potential. Thisexperiment will create a mock community mostly of fish, butincluding molluscs and crustaceans analyzed using differentprimer sets. This can demonstrate metabarcoding'seffectiveness as a qualitative measure for species abundancecomplementary to government agency monitoring. Based onpublished evidence suggesting environmental DNA can bequantitative in lakes and in deep ocean waters, there ispotential for the SFE to express a correlation betweensequence and species abundance. Mock communitysequencing to quantify primer biases will help increase theaccuracy of environmental DNA metabarcoding for speciesmonitoring in the San Francisco Estuary. Assessing the Development of Visual Short-Term Memory in the Preschool Period Using an Online Change- Detection Task Van Pham Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is the ability to briefly storeand maintain visual representations during disruptions ininformation that occur during eye movements and blinks. Thecurrent study examines VSTM during the preschool periodusing a change detection task on an online testing platform(Gorilla.sc). In change detection, participants are presented witha sample array containing several different colored squares, followed by a delayed period (during which they have to remember the sample items), and finally a test array containingthe previously presented items and one or more changed items.Infants demonstrate their VSTM for the items in the sample arrayby looking longer at the changed items to the non-changeditems in the test arrays (Oakes et al., 2013). We adapted thistask and tested fifty 12- to 48-month-old children. Ongoinganalyses will provide insight into (1) how VSTM develops frominfancy through early childhood and (2) whether we can detectVSTM in children using an online platform.One Climate Crisis, Many Climate Solutions: Differences between Prognostic Frames Employed by Climate Organizations in San Diego Megan Phelps Sponsor: Gwendolyn Arnold, Ph.D. Environmental Science & Policy Climate activism and advocacy has escalated in recentyears, with figures like Greta Thunberg at the forefront of whatpeople might think of as a single, unified global climatemovement. However, this movement is far from homogenous.Though climate organizations are motivated by the same broadtopic of climate change, how do their narratives surrounding(i.e., framing of) climate solutions differ? How does framingcorrelate with socio-demographic and political affiliation ofmembers within climate organizations? This article attempts toanswer these questions, using three San Diego climateorganizations as case studies. The study employs surveys todetermine socio-demographic and political characteristics. Ituses interviews; online content, including websites, mailings,press releases, and social media; and observations frommeetings to analyze key themes in each organization's climatesolution framing. Results will illustrate whether organizations filldifferent \"niches\" by using distinct frames to appeal to differentparticipants. Findings will also point to possibilities for coalitionbuilding within the climate movement as a whole: byacknowledging divergence in the way social movementorganizations define climate change, these groups can unifyaround shared goals to demand the rapid, far-reaching changerequired to address the global climate threat and preserve thelivability of the planet. Investigation of a Potential Neural Bases of Tinnitus Physio & Behavior Aging affects the structural integrity of the brain required forprocessing sound. Tinnitus, characterized by phantom sounds, ismost common in people with age-related high frequencyhearing loss. Symptom severity ranges from a nuisance to theimpairment of daily activities. Classic studies in young cats withcochlear damage revealed that the representation of largeareas of primary auditory cortex that were previously responsiveto high frequencies reorganized to become responsive to thehighest frequency that the animal could still hear. This corticalreorganization has been hypothesized to be the underlyingneural substrate of tinnitus, as the phantom sound is also at thehighest frequency that the person can still hear. I thereforeinvestigated neural activity differences between reorganizedand non-reorganized hearing loss. Icompared neural activity of a 26-year-old monkey to tonestimuli of different frequencies and durations using standardextracellular recording techniques. Stimuli were presented at thefrequency that the recorded neurons responded best to for 0.1,1, 10, and 100 seconds. Preliminary results indicate significantchanges in spectral, temporal, and duration effects betweennormal and reorganized cortex across the primary, core, andbelt auditory cortical regions.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 95Gene Expression Divergence in Drosophila Elizabeth Polston Sponsor: David Begun, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology While previous research has investigated genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between populations, sexes,species, and tissues, little work has simultaneouslycharacterized evolution of expression across multiple levels ofanalysis. Using recently publicly available RNA-seq data frommultiple species, sexes, and tissues in Drosophila, I aim toidentify previously unknown patterns of transcriptomedivergence in this clade. I have used bioinformatics software toidentify DE genes in three Drosophila species for both sexes intwo tissues. Now, I plan to compare the direction and patternsof expression in this clade using genes present in all threespecies. Preliminary results show that for each species,proportions of DE genes for each individual sex and tissuecomparison is similar. Additionally, comparisons for male andgonad tissues always had higher counts of DE genes regardlessof whether they diverged in the direction of gonad/reproductiveor male/female respectively. Further analysis will includeanalyzing the significance of these differences. These resultswill be widely applicable within Drosophila research and, moregenerally, genetics research because examining multiple levelsof biological differences within an evolutionary framework isnovel in this field. Evolutionary and Sequence Analysis of Putative Genes Associated with Nitrogen Use in Wheat Yan Pomogov Sponsor: Diane Beckles, Ph.D. Plant Sciences Wheat provides 20% of the calories consumed by humans andis grown on almost every continent on earth. Nitrogenousfertilizer is used to promote wheat yield and quality, but it isexpensive, and harmful to the environment, contributing togreenhouse gases and eutrophication of natural waterways.Therefore, improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), i.e., theproportion of nitrogen taken up from the soil and converted towheat biomass is important. Through QTL mapping, a region ofthe wheat genome potentially associated with NUE wasdiscovered. Some of the genes in this region may be related tonitrogen and nutrient uptake; however, they have not beencharacterized or, have not been studied in wheat. In this work,we will perform a full bioinformatics analysis of three candidategenes in this region. Evolutionary, sequence and proteinanalyses will be performed using an array of available tools.These data will build a foundation of the important informationneeded to help prioritize the genes for functional in-lab testing,to determine their potential contribution to NUE in wheat.Behavioral Differences Between Primate Species Living in Urban and Non-Urban Areas Maura Ponce Sponsor: Damien Caillaud, D.V.M.,Ph.D. Anthropology Human activities contribute to the decline of many wildlifespecies by exploiting and extending increasingly further intowild habitats. In the case of primates, some species have beenable to adapt to human disturbance by being able to live inurban areas, while other species only occur in non-urban areas.The objective of this study is to investigate factors allowingsome primate species to live in urban areas. We used data fromprimary literature, compiled in the Primate Social Behavior andConservation database from the Caillaud lab. We collected datafor fifty-four urban primate species and an equivalent number ofnon-urban species. We analysed our data usingphylogenetically controlled statistical tests and compared groupsize, activity budget, and dietary composition between urbanand non-urban species. Preliminary analyses suggest thatspecies in urban areas tend to live in smaller groups, spend ahigher percentage of their activity budget feeding and foraging,and have a more generalist diet compared to control species innon-urban areas. The results of this study should be consideredin future conservation efforts for urban and non-urban primatespecies. Impact of Imposter Syndrome on University Honors Transfer Students Bethany Ponte Sponsor: John Furlow, Ph.D. Neuro Physio & Behavior The importance of this research is to understand the impact thata University Honors Program (UHP) at an RI university has ontransfer students and their perceptions of imposter syndrome.The hypothesis is that many students will be affected byimposter syndrome in the University Honors Program by havinga fear of failure in the classroom and diminished involvement oncampus. The Clance Imposter Scale survey, that includedquestions such as their perceptions on being successful or notbelonging in their academics, was completed by a sample of4th-year transfer students in the UHP program. The studentswith survey scores over 60, indicating the benchmark forimposter syndrome, were invited to an hour interview thatdiscussed their process of being accepted to the UHP programand the ways that they became involved in their program. Dataanalysis is underway and will be completed by the time of theconference. I anticipate that this study will find that transferstudents lack a perception of acceptance and belonging whengoing to a large research university. Institutions and programswould benefit from supporting high achieving transfer studentsas they pursue their education, as they are a large portion of thestudent population.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 96Investing in Gentrification: The Eligibility of Gentrifying Neighborhoods for Federal Place-Based Economic Investment in U.S. Cities Amanda Portier Sponsor: Noli Brazil, Ph.D. Human Ecology Place-based policies aim to increase neighborhood economic well-being in disadvantaged areas through job opportunities,business development, or affordable housing. Policymakersattempt to target the most disadvantaged areas usingsocioeconomic criteria to determine if a neighborhood iseligible for program benefits. Selecting the most economicallydistressed neighborhoods for program eligibility ensures thatthe program aids those most in need. However, the selectioncriteria may not be successful in doing so. In this study, weexamine the relationship between neighborhood gentrificationstatus and 2018 eligibility for the following four federal place-based programs in U.S. cities: New Markets Tax Credits,Opportunity Zones, Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and theCommunity Development Financial Institution Fund. Our resultsindicate that large proportions of gentrifying neighborhoods areeligible for each program with many neighborhoods beingeligible for multiple programs. The Opportunity Zone program isdistinct as the probability of eligibility is nearly twice as high forgentrifying tracts than non-gentrifying tracts. We also find thatthe probability of program eligibility increases as the proportionof adjacent neighborhoods experiencing gentrificationincreases. Our findings suggest that the program eligibilitycriteria, most significantly with the Opportunity Zone program,does not always select the most economically disadvantagedneighborhoods. Functional Analysis of Female and Male Medfly Hazard Functions Camden Possinger Sponsor: Hans-georg Mueller, M.D.,Ph.D. Statistics One of the greatest mysteries that humankind has ever tried tosolve is longevity. Why do some live shorter and some longer?Can we do anything to prolong our longevity? In this ongoingstudy, I analyze the differences between a collection of maleand female hazard functions to identify distinct characteristicsand potential interaction effects. After an initial exploratoryanalysis, we discovered that at the end of a fly's lifespan theprobability of death was more variable for males than females.Furthermore, we hypothesized that there may also be asignificant interaction effect between these two. A formalanalysis of these and possible other observations will beconducted using Functional Concurrent Regression and byobtaining the Functional Principal Components from our sampledata. If significant findings are found the results will contributenew knowledge about this model species and help futurestudies evaluate differences in male and female medfly agingmore effectively.From Chaos to Success: Comparing the influence of Mixed Practice to that of Categorized Sets of Questions Vishwanath Prathikanti Sponsor: Ozcan Gulacar, Ph.D. Chemistry Questions in assignments for students are often grouped bychapter, topic, or concepts. The structure shows a greatemphasis on categorization. Practice problems in chemistrytextbooks are mostly organized by sections to help studentsnavigate the assignments and practice in order; however,exams usually test students with problems from a series ofchapters in a mixed format. Therefore, there is a mismatchbetween what students practice on and how they aretested. The goal of this study is to examine the structure of theassignments on students' problem-solving performances. Thestudy uses scientific control method and divides students intotwo groups throughout three experiment sessions. Each grouphad interventions with same length and identical questions butdifferent structures. The experimental group had mixedquestions, while the control group had questionsorganized based on chapters and topics. This study is criticalin studying students' learning abilities with mixed andcategorized problems. The findings could help UCDavis instructors to better structure their teachingmaterials to help improve students' problem-solving abilities. Given most textbooks and instructors tend toorganize and classify content for students to navigate theknowledge base, this study is important to assessthe effectiveness of the traditional teaching method. Parent-child emotion talk and its link to children's emotion regulation: A cross-cultural comparison between Mexican-American Jia Lei Qiu Sponsor: Yuuko Tonkovich, Ed.D. Education Past studies have shown that parents' openness in emotion talk(ET) with their child can facilitate a stronger sense of control inthe child's emotion regulation (ER). ET is the use of emotionlanguage (e.g. emotion words, emotion questions) and plays acrucial role in socializing emotion understanding and behaviors.ER encompasses all processes in monitoring, understanding,and modifying one's reactions to the outside environment in aneffort to accomplish one's goals. However, there is lessresearch with families of diverse cultural backgrounds. Toaddress the gaps in previous research, this study examinesdifferences in cultural groups and the associations between ETand children's ER with Mexican-American (MA) (N=46) andChinese-American (CA) (N=44) families from Head Start. Parentswere asked to read a picture book, \"Frog, Where Are You?\" totheir child. Children's ER was assessed by the Transparent Boxtask, a frustration eliciting task. Preliminary results showsignificant differences in ET between MA and CA parents withMA parents showing more ET than CA parents. Preliminaryfindings also show associations between parents' negativewords and child's persistence during the Transparent Boxactivity. These results suggest possible cultural differences.Implications will be discussed.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 97Relations on the Mapping Class Monoid Victoria Quijano Sponsor: Laura Starkston, Ph.D. Mathematics The mapping class group of a surface is a set of functions which continuously bend and stretch the surface, calledhomeomorphisms. In the mapping class group, twohomeomorphisms are considered to be equivalent if they areisotopic to one another. Furthermore, homeomorphisms of theannulus that fix the boundary pointwise are called Dehn twists,and products of Dehn twists along simple closed curves in anysurface generate the entire mapping class group of that surface.Using the swing presentation, Margalit and McCammond havepreviously defined a complete set of relations on the mappingclass group. In this project, we consider the elements of themapping class group that can be generated only by positiveDehn twists, which form the mapping class monoid. We aim todefine new relations on the mapping class monoid of a genus 0surface in order to determine when two elements areequivalent. This information can be used to analyze Lefschetzfibrations, which build 4-dimensional spaces with boundaryusing surfaces together with products of positive Dehn twistsaround simple closed curves. In particular, the boundaries oftwo Lefschetz fibrations are homeomorphic if their associatedproducts of Dehn twists are equivalent in the mapping classmonoid. Infant Motor Development Influencing Visual Preference Franchesca Quintero Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology Infants are incredibly adept learners, possessing the ability togather pertinent environmental information about the world andhow it works. This study investigates the relationship betweenan infant's access to information, in the form of motordevelopment, and their visual attention to objects with complexfeatures. Research has shown a robust link between infantexperience manipulating objects and their visual attention toobject properties. In the present study, 4-12-month-old infants(N = 100) were shown pairs of unfamiliar objects. One objectwas easily \"graspable\", with a handle-like region, specialized forgrasping, while the other was not. Additionally, parentscompleted a motor development questionnaire about theirinfant's motor abilities. All data were collected through theLookit online platform and coded with Datavyu software for theduration of looking at both objects. We hypothesize thatincreasingly complex motor capabilities, such as crawling orwalking will influence the features of objects that infants findmost interesting. Thus, an infant with motor ability that allows forobject obtainment and manipulation will show a visualpreference for objects with specialized features, such ashandles.Better with Time? The Effects of Parental Experience and Age on Prolactin Regulation in the Brain of a Biparental Bird Alison Ramirez Sponsor: Victoria Farrar, Ph.D. Neuro Physio & Behavior As animals age and gain parental experience, they present afaster onset of parental behavior towards young. Varioushormones underlie the transition into parental care and maydiffer in levels between inexperienced and experiencedparents. Prolactin, a hormone famous for its role in milkproduction in mammals also drives parental care behavior invertebrates, including birds. While previous studies conductedshow how prolactin levels affect parental care behaviors ininexperienced and experienced individuals, it is unknownwhether sensitivity to prolactin changes in the brain. Thus, thisstudy will examine the separate effects of age and parentalexperience on prolactin responsiveness in the brain bymeasuring gene expression. To address this, we collected braintissue from the rock dove (Columbia livia), as both sexes of thisbird present prolactin-driven parental care behavior. We willassess the amount of prolactin receptor genes expressed indoves with varying levels of age and experience usingquantitative PCR. We hypothesize that experienced parents willhave more sensitivity to parental hormones, therefore displayinga higher level of prolactin receptors. These results will provideus with a deeper understanding of the neural changes occurringin the parental brain as animals gain reproductive experiencewhile controlling for age. Real-time microscopic imaging of hCTPS interactions with organelles and cytoskeleton. Yaniel Ramirez Sponsor: Enoch Baldwin, Ph.D. The human intracellular cytosine triphosphate (CTP) pool issubject to tight regulation because it can limit cellular growthand proliferation. In humans, Cytidine Triphosphate Synthetase 1and de-novoCTP biosynthesis. In all different hCTPSenzyme conformational states are reversibly sequestered intomicron scale polymeric filaments that alter enzyme activity orallosteric properties and are critical to regulating hCTPS output.In human MCF10A cells expressing fluorescently-taggedhCTPSs, these filaments appear as two distinct pools, smaller\"punctae\" and larger \"rods\". Both forms are dynamicallytransported and localized which suggests that their cellularlocations are important to their function. We hypothesize thatsequestering dynamically transported punctae and rods focuseshCTPSs activity to sub-cellular regions and further contributes totheir regulation. This hypothesis predicts hCTPS associationswith cellular components. To define these associations moreprecisely, we will use CellLight\u00ae reagents to RFP-tag target intra-cellular in with puncta and rods,as well as cytoskeletal components that mediate their transportand localization in real time.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 98The Effect of Information Value on Attentional Guidance is Proportionate to the Perceived Variability of the Stimulus Arya Ranadive Sponsor: Joy Geng, Ph.D. Psychology Our environment is complex and dynamic, making it critical for observers to determine what information in the environment isimportant for achieving their goals. In this study, we testedwhether attention is moderated by the perceived reliability ofinformation used to predict upcoming stimuli. During trials,participants were presented with a cue and then searched forthe object most similar to the cue, called the target. The cue hada specific orientation, which indicated the most likely orientationof the target, and color, which indicated the reliability of theorientation information. The reliability was manipulated by usinga Gaussian distribution with low, medium, or high variance. Aftereach block, participants rated how informative the cue wasduring search. The data replicated previous results showing thatas the reliability of the cue increased, the effect of targetorientation on search increased (t(59)=3.23, p< .01). Additionally,we show that individuals that perceive a greater difference incue reliability also showed a greater difference in the effect ofcue to target orientation difference for different cues (pearson r= .254, p <.05). These results suggest that participants'individual perception of information reliability moderatesattention for predicted upcoming stimuli. Exploring the Bioclimatic Distribution of a Worldwide Plant Pathogen Kliebenstein, Ph.D. Plant Sciences is a pathogenic fungus that forms a grayish mold that infects a wide range of plants. It creates a devastatingfinancial loss for vegetable, fruit, and ornamental plant growers.Botrytis thrives in cool and wet spring and summer weather,usually around 15-25?. Although Botrytis is a widespread plantpathogen, its genetic diversity and bioclimatic distributions arenot well documented at a large scale. To address thosedistributions, the lab created a database of more than 9000strains. The database is a combination of a meta-analysis ofstrains of 48 studies describing strains of Botrytis from differentregions of the world, and the global weather and climate datafrom the WorldClim dataset. The variables include the hostspecies and extreme or limiting environmental factors,specifically the temperature of the coldest and warmest month,and precipitation of the wet and dry quarters. Such meta-analysis dataset provides an avenue to explore questions on thesusceptible hosts, the critical times and climatic conditions forBotrytis infection using data analysis and statistical tools such asR.Caffeine Biodegradation and Chemotaxis Response Parales, Ph.D. Microbiology & Molec Genetics Caffeine is widely consumed in food products and beveragesand is used as an active ingredient in some medications. Manyaquatic environments are experiencing caffeine pollution, whichis drastically affecting the balance of ecosystems. Previousresearch indicates that bacterial chemotaxis\u2014the directedmovement of cells toward an attractant or away from a repellent\u2014enhances the biodegradation of chemicals. Therefore,understanding how bacteria sense and degrade caffeine and itsdegradation intermediates is important for applications in thefood, medical, and bioremediation industries. The Paraleslaboratory has been studying caffeine degradation byMethylorubrum populi strain PINKEL, which was isolated fromcompost by selective enrichment for growth on caffeine. StrainPINKEL is a facultative methylotroph that can use caffeine as itssole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. Recent work in thelaboratory has shown that strain PINKEL is significantly moreefficient at caffeine degradation than other caffeine degradingbacteria, such as Pseudomonas strains, and displays achemotactic response to caffeine. Our aim is to use PINKEL andits caffeine catabolizing enzymes for decaffeination andbioremediation of caffeine-contaminated environments by firstcarrying out a detailed characterization of the chemotacticresponse to caffeine by strain PINKEL. Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii as a Sustainable Platform for Recombinant Insulin Production Jasmine Rattanpal Sponsor: Marc Facciotti, Ph.D. Biomedical Engineering As the demand for medicine continues to grow, currentmethods of therapeutic protein production can be expensiveand unsustainable. Our project aims to genetically engineerChlamydomonas reinhardtii to produce the mini-insulinrecombinant protein in an effort to make medicine productionsustainable and cost effective. C. Reinhardtii is a single-celled eukaryotic algae whose chloroplast is capable of producingtherapeutic-grade proteins. Because C. Reinhardtii is relativelyinexpensive and only requires sunlight, low-filtration water, aninexpensive buffer, trace minerals, CO2 and a nitrogen sourceto survive, it is an ideal platform for inexpensive proteinproduction compared to current methods. We report ourprogress towards investigating the potential of C. reinhardtii as a protein production platform, and our progress towards geneticconstruct design and algal strain engineering with mini-proinsulin as our primary candidate protein. Currently we aredesigning our protein purification protocol for when we return tothe lab in person. The Algae to Insulin Project is part ofBioInnovation Group, which is one of the first undergraduate-run research organizations at UC Davis providing undergraduatestudents with collaborative and innovative research experience.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 99Characterizing Hydra's Endodermal Nervous System Brandon Reyes-Chavez Sponsor: Celina Juliano, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio The rate of neurogenesis rapidly declines as humans age, limiting our ability to recover from nervous system injury. Thus,understanding the genetic control of neurogenesis is essentialin developing effective treatments for human neurologicaldisease. The freshwater cnidarian Hydra vulgaris can quicklyand accurately regenerate its entire nervous system after injuryand many Hydra neural genes are conserved in vertebrates,making it an excellent model to study neurogenesis. Hydra'snervous system is composed of two nerve nets, one located inits outer epithelium (ectoderm) and one in its inner epithelium(endoderm). Our lab has developed a molecular map of theHydra nervous system, which includes 12 neuronal subtypes,three of which are in the endoderm. I aim to 1) define thestructure of the endodermal nervous system, and 2)characterize the regulatory elements necessary to build eachendodermal subtype. To do this, I will create transgenic reporterlines for each neuron subtype. I will then use fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate transgenic neurons,followed by ATAC-seq to identify regulatory elementsunderlying endodermal neuron specification. My work will resultin a complete structural and regulatory characterization of theendodermal nerve net, allowing for insights into Hydra nervoussystem regeneration. Incidental Findings found on Abdominal Imaging performed for General Surgery Patients Rafael Emilio Ricon Sponsor: Michael Campbell, M.D. MED: Surgery The use of computerized tomography (CT) imaging hasincreased, leading to a rise in the identification of incidentalfindings (IF). Inappropriate follow-up of IFs can lead to poorpatient outcomes, delayed treatment and increased costs. Therate of patient awareness and follow-up of IFs has not beenevaluated in patients admitted to an acute care surgery (ACS)service. We conducted a review of ACS patients with a primarycare provider (PCP) admitted from January 2014 to December2019. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence andrate of appropriate follow-up of IFs. 2047 patients met inclusioncriteria and 163 (8%) were included in this interim analysis. 80(49%) patients had a PCP. 30 (24%) patients received additionalfollow-up of their IF. Of the patients receiving follow-up, 9 (30%)had a recommendation for follow-up highlighted in the report oftheir index CT scan. 48 (60%) patients had the IF included intheir discharge summary. 16 (53%) were referred to a specialist,with (2) 3% of patients ultimately having a life-threatening IF. IFsare common in the ACS population. Despite efforts to informpatients of their IF, the majority of ACS patients do not receiverecommended follow-up.Fiery Women: The Myth of the P\u00e9troleuses in America Robert Ridgley Sponsor: Adam Zientek, Ph.D. History On the afternoon of May 21, 1871, the Paris Commune began tocollapse. The French Army finally infiltrated Paris and startedmassacring the Communard revolutionaries that seized the citytwo months earlier. Amidst the bloodshed, a rumor circulated.French bourgeoisie wrote and published fabricated stories of8000 female revolutionaries that crept throughout Paris and lit itaflame. While false, these accounts of wretched p\u00e9troleuses(female fire-starters) spread throughout France and reaffirmedpopular beliefs that when women involved themselves inpolitics, they became unruly, violent, and dangerous. This thesisexamines the myth of the p\u00e9troleuses in the late nineteenth-century United States. During the fall of the Paris Commune,American media published the fabricated accounts of womenarsonists and spread the myth throughout the country.Conservative leaders and newspapers then weaponized themyth of the p\u00e9troleuse against women's rights and feministreform. Just as in France, the p\u00e9troleuse came to represent the danger of women leaving the household and entering the publicsphere\u2014for allowing women to participate in politics resulted inliberty, equality, and inferno. Design and Implementation of a Video Game to Teach Programming to Non-Technology Majors Daniel Ritchie Sponsor: Darnel Degand, Ed.D. Education Programming can be a difficult skill to learn for manyundergraduate college students. However, learning to code canbe extremely useful and beneficial to know for a number offields, to aid with data analysis and visualization in those fields.Additionally, computational thinking is helpful for a betterunderstanding of many of the technologies we use on a dailybasis. In order to aid this learning, I chose a game as mymedium because it has a high potential to motivate studentsand provide a good learning environment. I designed and begandeveloping this video game to teach coding in the Rprogramming language to non-computer science majors. Whilethere are existing games that teach coding, I identified aspectsin each that detract from their educational effectiveness. Amajority have been made for a different audience thanundergraduate college students, and have design choices thatare profit-motivated instead of educationally motivateddecisions. I then designed my game based on research-backededucational and game design principles which I identified andrecorded in a literature review and evaluation of existing games.The game is expected to improve students' learning ofintroductory programming skills and principles, with anemphasis on data science concepts.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 100Investigating the Role of PLCE1 Risk Variants on the PI3K/Akt have identified a large number of genomic variants, specifically single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs), associated with increased risk (GC). Three of these risk SNPs (rs2274223, rs3765524,and within the PLCE1 a phospholipase enzyme that has been shown tofunction within the PI3K signaling cascade, a commonlydysregulated pathway in cancer. However, the effect of thesevariants on PLCE1 function and GC risk remains unexplored. Inthis we rs3765524 and rs1050970 genotype tumormutation frequency of genes within the PI3K/Akt pathway. Wealso explored the association of these risk SNPs subtypes genomically stable and chromosomalinstable). Finally, we generated in vitro models of risk SNPrs2274223 which results in a Histidine to Arginine amino acidsubstitution to assess its effect on PLCE1 function. Our studyprovides a critical evaluation of the role of PLCE1 GWAS-riskvariants in GC development for application in patient treatmentand prevention. The Impact of A-G Reform Cecilia Rodarte Sponsor: Giovanni Peri, Ph.D. Economics Getting more students to obtain a higher education has been agoal in the United States for many years. In order for students tosuccessfully obtain a college degree they also have to beprepared for the rigor of college level courses. In an effort toensure that students graduating high school are academicallyprepared for college, some districts across California haveincorporated the A-G requirements to their high schoolgraduation requirements. The A-G requirements are courses inseven different subject areas that are required to be completedwith a grade of a \"C\" or better in order to be eligible to attend afour-year public university in California, such as a University ofCalifornia (UC) or a California State University (CSU). I useschool-level data from the California Department of Educationand an event study design to look at how this change ingraduation requirements has impacted high school graduationrates and the successful completion rates of the A-Grequirements, that is with a grade of a \"C\" or better. I alsoexplore the relationship between this policy and collegeenrollment rates using a cross-section regression.Sex Differences in the Peripheral Blood Gene Co- Expression Networks Following Human Intracerebral caused by bleedingfrom a burst artery within the brain. The peripheral immunesystem has been implicated in ICH response. Since there areextensive sex differences in the immune system, weinvestigated the sex differences in the peripheral blood immuneresponse following human ICH. Thus, we performed whole-transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood from 48 male and 18female subjects split evenly between ICH and vascular riskfactor controls (VRFC). We conducted separate Weighted GeneCo-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) which revealed 2significant gene co-expression modules (of 40) (p<0.05) in maleICH, while 5 significant gene co-expression modules (of 29) infemale ICH. Common biological processes (n=8) affected both inmale and female ICH (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p<0.05)included innate immune response, blood coagulation, and Fc- receptor signaling involved in phagocytosis. Female ICHsubjects had more biological processes specific to them (n=164)compared to the number of bioprocesses immunoglobulin receptorbinding, Fc- e, and B-cell receptor signaling pathways. The findings underscore the significance of further investigating sex-differences and sex-specific treatment targets leading towardpersonalized medicine. Do GRE scores predict Graduate school success for Communication students? Mercedes Ross Sponsor: Richard Huskey, Ph.D. Communication The GRE exam is used to predict how well students will do ingraduate school. The strongest evidence to support thisprediction is during the students first year of graduate schooland after that the evidence is unclear. Minority applicants tendto score lower on the exam than white and Asian applicants andthis disparity in scores means that minority applicants aresystematically disadvantaged in graduate school acceptance. Anumber of factors make it difficult for minorities to take the GREexam and the current online format is another hurdle. Our goalis to determine if the GRE is useful for predicting graduateschool success for Communication students. We will collect dataon undergraduate GPA, GRE scores, graduation rate, race, ageand gender from all the institutions that grant PhDs inCommunication within the United States listed on the NCAProgram Guide. Once the data are gathered, we will assess ifthe GRE scores predict graduate school success inCommunication PhD programs. If the scores prove to be validpredictors of success, then graduate schools should continue touse them. If not, then graduate schools may be more supportiveof minorities by adopting more holistic forms of applicationreview.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 101Evaluating Cultural Destruction Jurisprudence through Criminal Response, Restorative Response, and Regulatory Process Perspectives Devapriya Roy Sponsor: Keith Watenpaugh, Ph.D. Religious Studies Cultural heritage has a tenuous relationship with international humanitarian law. This thesis assesses the current state ofinternational legal structures that exist to protect culturalheritage in times of conflict and formulates why culturaldestruction should be treated as a consequential human rightsissue. I lay out the history and conception of cultural genocideand destruction in human rights theory, before evaluating thethree approaches that have been taken to address thedestruction of culture: the criminal response, restorativeresponse and regulatory process. In the criminal responsesection, I analyze the International Criminal Court's role inprotecting cultural heritage. I utilize The Prosecutor v. Ahmad AlFaqi Al Mahdi-the first case where the ICC imposed a sentencefor attacking cultural heritage-and other cases to conceptualizethis approach. In the restorative response section, I explorepost-Holocaust legal restitution efforts through existingliterature, paying special attention to looted art. Finally, in theregulatory process section, we see cultural heritage beingconceptualized as matters of property law and subject torepatriation. I use the Native American Graves Protection andRepatriation Act as a case study to explore subsequent litigationand the steps taken to protect indigenous cultural propertyrights. Assessing Drivers of Genetic Diversity on Coral Reefs Camille Rumberger Sponsor: Rachael Bay, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology Coral reefs in the Anthropocene face a profound decline from aculmination of global and local threats. Genetic diversity canserve as the raw material for adaptation, buffering species fromthe effects of such stressors, yet large-scale surveys betweenand across species of coral are lacking. Therefore, it isessential to assess the drivers of genetic diversity and itsconsequences for recovery. Here we compile a global databaseof genetic diversity from microsatellites in species of Acropora,the largest coral genus. We use expected heterozygosity as ameasure of diversity, and compare this to both species trait andspatial environmental data to uncover the drivers of thisdiversity. Preliminary analyses show that pH and species' upperdepth limit are the variables most strongly associated withgenetic diversity. Additionally, we find that the CaribbeanAcropora palmata has unexpectedly high genetic diversity, thehighest of any Acroporid species. These findings suggest thatthere is evidence for species-specific genetic diversity levelsand that abiotic factors and anthropogenic induced stressorsmay influence the genetic diversity of the genus Acropora.Considering the importance of genetic diversity amongstpopulations, management strategies can utilize the informationof allelic diversity to generate an assessment of large-scaleecological change.An Artistic Exploration of Women in Surrealism Genevieve Ryan Sponsor: Michael Subialka, Ph.D. Comparative Literature Many male artists within the Surrealist movement objectifiedwomen. They presented women as sources for inspiration anddesire yet without their own agency and subjectivity. Femalebodies were often seen as muses, objects, or tools for the maleartists' own artistic goals. I study this trend in Surrealism andresearch how female Surrealists either conformed to orsubverted these sexist tendencies in the movement. In spite ofthe negative portrayals of women, many female Surrealistscreated artwork that gave agency to their female subjects.Responding to this research, I create my own collection ofartwork and creative writing that approaches Surrealism from afemale perspective. In addition, my artwork explores theSurrealist themes of perception, the body, and desire, as well astheir relationship to gender and sexuality. The collectionincorporates various Surrealist techniques such as automaticwriting, collage, and exquisite corpse. Through creativelyexploring the movement's themes and techniques in my ownwork, I contribute to a legacy of female Surrealists who critiquethe imbalance of gender within the movement and embracefemale autonomy. Fullerene Metal Coordination and Molecular Surgery Josiah Sanchez Sponsor: Alan Balch, Ph.D. Chemistry Recent advances in synthetic chemistry have allowed for thepossibility to perform molecular surgery and expand uponprevious endohedral fullerene research. Molecular surgeryenables us to perform C-C bond scission to create and enlargeorifices on the surface of a fullerene, as a precursor to smallmolecule insertion. Encapsulation after molecular surgery hasbeen observed with smaller covalent compounds like water andformaldehyde. However, due to size, the isolation of platinumand palladium coordinated fullerenes are still being investigated.As per the findings of Murata, M. Murata, and K. Komatsu,palladium-fullerene coordination complexes have been isolatedand identified. These findings suggest that coordinating another d 10 metal, such as platinum, would be a promising candidate for C60 derivative, MMK9. MMK9 contains an activated carbon double bond surrounded by two carbonyl moieties, which facilitates metal coordination. It is our goal to syntheticallyexecute these procedures, maximize purification and selectivity,isolate and crystallize these compounds, and characterize andhost-guest interactions using X-ray crystallography as well asNMR, IR, and UV-Vis spectroscopy.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 102Social Skills and State Anxiety in Children Micaella Sanchez Sponsor: Camelia Hostinar Caudill, Ph.D. Psychology Previous research has shown a relation between social skills and anxiety in youth, such that higher anxiety symptoms arelinked to poorer peer interactions. In this study, we examinedchildren's self-reported state anxiety and social skills.Participants were 107 children ages 9-11 (Mean age = 9.90, SD =.59, 51.4% female) who completed the Social Skills RatingSystem (SSRS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children(STAIC). State anxiety was reported 30 minutes after childrenunderwent a modified Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-M), a well-validated social-evaluative stressor. The SSRS includes foursubscales: cooperation, assertion, empathy, self-control.State anxiety was negatively correlated with cooperation, r(97) =-.24, p = .017; assertion, r(96) = -.25, p = .012; empathy, r(97) = - .26, p = .008; and self-control, r(96) = -.21, p = .04. Our results indicate that children who reported higher state anxietyfollowing a stressor also reported having poorer social skills. Inthe future directions of this work, we aim to understand howinterventions, such as art therapy, may relieve state anxiety andimprove social functioning in children. However, thedirectionality of this relationship is unknown. Controlled Error Checking CubeSat Operating System Mridul Sarkar Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The purpose of this project is the creation of a CubeSatOperating System. Space and Satellite Systems (SSS) Club hasresearched and developed novel pieces of flight readyhardware. Our mission's success relies on interfacing with thesepieces of hardware as they work together in space withouthuman intervention. In order to do this, the Computer Systemsteam of SSS has developed an autonomous Operating System(OS). Our OS is built on 'Modes', each being a differentfunctionality of our satellite. A 'Mode' stays active or switches toanother one based on the health of our CubeSat and itscomponents. The health of our CubeSat is monitored by ourwatchdog and a dictionary of error codes which relays exactlywhat is wrong. This abstraction of logic has led us to a fullyautonomous CubeSat due to the nature of our softwaredevelopment principles, OS architecture, and Concept ofOperations. The Controlled Error Checking Operating Systemwill be iterated upon and used for future CubeSat missions atUC Davis. Future work will include open source architecture forany CubeSat mission with little to no modification of internals.Finding the minimum of a unsorted database in log(n) Mridul Sarkar Sponsor: Bruno Nachtergaele, Ph.D. Mathematics The purpose of this project is to develop a software library forMicrosoft's Qsharp Language, an open source quantumcomputing language. I utilized Python and Qsharp to build thelibrary and referenced the paper titled 'A quantum algorithm for finding theminimum'. I was fortunate enough to have help from Dr. H\u00f8yer,Dr. Sarah Kaiser, Dr. Chris Garnade, and Rolf Huismanthroughout the development of this algorithm. I have built thealgorithm and its test cases. I have rigorously proven theefficiency of the algorithm with reference to 'Tight bounds onquantum searching' and 'A fast quantum mechanical algo-rithmfor database search'. I am in the process of testing the algorithmand verifying results. Currently computers can find the minimumof an unsorted database in computational complexity of O(N/2).The software library I have developed can find the minimum inO(log(N)). If we choose N to equal 1,000 a regular algorithm willfind the minimum after 500 iterations whereas the quantumalgorithm only takes 3 steps. This is a stark difference incomputational efficiency and there is potential for disruptiveindustry application. Comparison of Machine Learning Models for Image Classification Mridul Sarkar Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The purpose of this project is to teach UC Davis's first CubeSat when to collect pictures and IR sensor data. The Space andSatellite Systems (SSS) Club has developed a CubeSat that laysthe foundation for low cost missions focused on Earth Science.This mission objective relies heavily on the problem of when tocollect data and ensuring the quality of our data. This isaccomplished through machine learning and information theoryand processing by the Computer Systems Team of SSS. Afterdedicated research, we have compared and contrasted threemethods for teaching our CubeSat: Linear Regression, LogisticRegression, and Support Vector Machine. Our results wereverified with mathematical optimization. We are developing anovel data set, which is highly sought after in Machine Learningresearch, to further test our methods. Future work will include anovel method that will not only teach the machine, but allow itto actively learn at low cost to our power systems.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 103Investigating SynDIG4 Endocytic Trafficking as a Mechanism for AMPAR trafficking at the postsynaptic membrane is a key component of synapticplasticity. Previous results have indicated that the AMPARauxiliary factor SynDIG4 has roles in clustering and maintainingpools of extrasynaptic AMPARs necessary for synapsedevelopment and plasticity. In this study, we aim to characterizeSynDIG4 trafficking route and identify the mechanism by which itinteracts with AMPARs. We hypothesize that SynDIG4 firsttransiently traffics to the plasma membrane to capture GluA1.We predict the GluA1-SynDIG4 complex then becomesinternalized where it concentrates as a pool of extrasynapticreceptors. In this study, we first blocked endocytosis chemicallyusing the endocytosis inhibitor, dynasore. We then identified accumulation at the cellsurface upon inhibition of endocytosis, suggesting the protein istrafficked to the plasma membrane. We plan to extend the studyby co-expressing GluA1 and assess effects on localization of thesubunit. These studies provide insight into the localization andtrafficking of SynDIG4, which will further contribute to theunderstanding of its role in AMPAR related synaptic plasticity. Parenting Effects on Language Development in Mexican- American Yuuko Tonkovich, Ed.D. Education Past research has found mixed results on the relation betweenparenting styles and the development of young children'slanguage skills. More research is needed with dual languagelearners (DLLs) to promote bilingual development, especially tomaintain their heritage language skills. This project wasanchored to examine parenting styles and practices in familieswith DLLs and to investigate the association between parentingstyles (authoritarian and authoritative) and parenting practices(amount of parent-child activities) and their collective effects onMexican American (MA) children and Chinese American (CA)DLLs' oral comprehension and vocabulary retention of heritagelanguage, controlling for confounders of parental languagedominance and parental educational levels. Data were collectedfrom a total of 55 MA and 64 CA DLLs enrolled in Head Startprograms and their first-generation parents. Parenting Stylesand Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) and demographic surveywere completed by parents to investigate parenting styles andparenting practices. MA and CA DLLs were assessed on theirheritage language oral proficiency. Preliminary results suggestthat parenting styles and practices were similar for MA and CAparents and parenting practices were more associated withchildren's heritage language development than parenting styles.Implications for families will be discussed. Characterizing Radiation Damage in Materials with Molecular Dynamics Chad Serrao Sponsor: Jeremy Mason, Ph.D. Materials Science&engineering Radiation is known to cause damage to the microstructure ofmaterial systems. High-energy particles can displace atoms fromtheir lattice sites in crystalline materials, introducing highconcentrations of point defects that change the mechanicalproperties of the material (e.g. a decrease in both strength andductility). While molecular dynamics simulations have previouslybeen used to simulate this process, simulations of displacementcascades are computationally expensive enough to generallylimit the radiation dose to values well below those relevant toexperiments. Our research instead makes use of adisplacement-relaxation algorithm that is conjectured to resultin the same configurations, but minimizes the computationalcost, allowing simulations of larger material systems with higherradiation doses. Improving our understanding of radiationdamage potentially allows for the design of materials that betterresist radiation damage, with applications in fission and fusionreactors, nuclear waste storage, and radiation protectionsystems for future space missions. Exploring the Relation between Contextual Attention and Theory of Mind in Children Ujashi Shah Sponsor: Lindsay Bowman, Ph.D. Psychology Theory of Mind (ToM) describes the understanding that internalmental states, such as desires, beliefs and thoughts, guideexternal behavior in the real world. ToM is foundational tofunctioning in the social world, including teaching, moraljudgements and cooperation. This understanding developsdramatically from ages 3- to 8-years, but more research isneeded to uncover all of the contributing factors (e.g., languagedevelopment) that support the transition to a matureunderstanding of others' mental states. This project will examinea theoretically important but underexplored contributor tochildren's ToM: the ability to attend to contextual information ina scene, and to use that information to inform judgementsabout a character's mental state. Prior research has shownreliable individual differences in children's context sensitivitythat are independent of other non-social skills (e.g., executivefunction). The present study examines children's attention tocontextual information in both social and non-social scenes, andhow individual differences in these skills relate to ToM inchildren ages 4- to 8-years-old. The research study is ongoing,data collection will be done through an online platform, andresults and analyses will be completed by spring of 2021.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 104Crystal Structure Characterization and Electronic Structure of a p-type Zintl Ph.D. Chemistry Thermoelectric materials are capable of producing a voltage under a temperature gradient. Material efficiency depends on the figure of merit zT ( zT = a2T/) , where a is the Seebeck coefficient, is the electrical resistivity, is the sum of the lattice and electrical thermal conductivity, and T is the absolute temperature. These parameters are strongly coupled, and anideal material is required to have a combination of both efficientelectron transport and strong phonon scattering. Zintl phasesare a structural category of materials that generally featurecomplex crystal structures due to the large range of bondingthat can be accommodated. Related phases to Yb 3AlSb3 have shown decent zTs that have been achieved by doping. Forexample, the Na-doped Ca 3AlSb3 yields a maximum zT of 0.8 at 1050 K. A similar structure with a more metallic element onthe cation site, Yb 3AlSb3, has been obtained by metal flux methods. Herein, the synthetic conditions, the crystal structuredetermined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, andelectronic structure calculations are reported. Further researchwill focus on doping the Yb with other elements for propertyoptimization. Paternal Anxiety as a Predictor of Change in Youth Anxiety Across Time. Mukul Sharda Sponsor: Ben Reeb, Ph.D. Psychology Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent and debilitatingpsychiatric problems affecting adolescents and young adults.Fathers have been underrepresented in research on theintergenerational transmission of anxiety, despite growingevidence that anxiety runs in families. Using prospective datafrom a community sample of 451 adolescents (49% female) fromheterosexual two-parent families, the aim of this study was toinvestigate the unique effects of paternal SCL-90-R anxietysymptoms on youth anxiety symptoms from adolescence (age13) to early adulthood (age 21). Using autoregressive multipleregression analyses, paternal anxiety was examined as apredictor of change in youth anxiety across time. Statisticalcontrols included maternal anxiety, maternal and paternaldepressive symptoms, youth sex, and family socioeconomicstatus. Because previous research has documented sexdifferences in anxiety problems, youth sex was examined as amoderator of associations between father and adolescentanxiety symptoms. Father anxiety symptoms predictedadolescent anxiety symptoms, but only among father-daughterdyads. These findings add to a growing literature on fathers'role in adolescent psychopathology and highlight theimportance of further research on how and under whichconditions anxiety is transmitted from one generation to thenext.Relationship Between Socioeconomic Status and Pediatric Diagnoses of Anxiety in Girls with Fragile X Syndrome Roxanna Sharifi Sponsor: Paul Hagerman, M.D.,Ph.D. MED: Biochem & Molecular Med Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGGrepeat in the 5' untranslated region of FMR1, an X-linked gene. Itis known as the most common heritable cause of intellectualdisability and autism and is comorbid with anxiety. It has beenpreviously demonstrated that individuals with FXS from lowersocioeconomic statuses (SES) exhibit impaired social andcognitive function. The objective of this project is to determineif a positive correlation exists between lower SES and anxietydisorders in girls with FXS. Child behavioral data were analyzedbetween control (n=42) and FXS (n=55) participants, aged 6-16,and their respective SESs. ECG data collected during the NIRSconversation task, where participants were prompted tomaintain eye contact during a conversation, will also beanalyzed as a measure of anxiety and arousal. T-test results forthe behavioral data suggest that girls from a lower SES in thecontrol group, but not in the FXS group, show higher levels ofanxiety-related behavior. These preliminary findings support theemotional internalization of girls with FXS and emphasize theimportance of broader SES representation in future studies tobetter understand the socioemotional and behavioral impact ofFXS in the context of environmental influence on anxiety. Borderline Personality Disorder: A Stigmatized and Misunderstood Mental Disorder Anshika Sharma Sponsor: Melzer, Ph.D. University Writing Program Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) has been defined by theAmerican Psychological Association (APA) as \"a personalitydisorder characterized by a long-standing pattern of instabilityin mood, interpersonal relationships, and self-image that issevere enough to cause extreme distress or interfere with socialand occupational functioning.\" Research shows that BPD isamong the most stigmatized mental disorders and is oftenassociated with negative symptoms or behaviors. This researchproject discusses BPD, a disorder that is stigmatized by bothsociety and mental health professionals. The research method Iprimarily used for this project was reviewing several peer-reviewed journals and literature on the topic. The stigmatizationof BPD throughout the years has made it difficult for patients toget access to psychological and psychiatric treatment.Furthermore, such individuals face misdiagnosis, which delaysthe treatment process further. Training programs andinterventions for nurses and practitioners have assisted inreduced stereotyping and better treatment for patients. Mentalhealth advocacy and increased research has reduced the stigmaassociated with BPD by a significant amount and has cleareddifferences between similar disorders. Additionally, advocacyhas allowed advocates and professionals to convey accurate and necessary information about BPD to patients' families, as well as the general public.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 105Blunt Aortic Injury: A Review of Techniques and Outcomes Sponsor: Steven Maximus, M.D. MED: Surgery Blunt aortic injury is the second leading cause of death in all blunt traumas. These injuries most commonly occur because ofmotor vehicle crashes, in which rapid deceleration causes a tearto the aorta, the largest blood vessel in the body. Most patientsdon't survive long enough to reach the hospital. For those thatdo, there are different options to treat this injury. Traditionally,they've been repaired with open surgery. Recently, surgeonshave begun to use a minimally invasive technique calledThoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair, also known as TEVAR. Thisspecialized technique allows surgeons to perform the entireoperation through two small incisions in the groin. This issignificantly less invasive than opening up the chest as isnecessary for other procedures. This study will perform aretrospective chart review of patients who have beendiagnosed with a blunt aortic injury. Our primary endpoints aremortality and neurologic deficits. Led by UC Irvine, this studyaims to evaluate how the TEVAR technique, as opposed toother operations, is performed at the five different UC HealthSystem institutes. It also aims to assess the long-term outcomesof patients who have had both open aortic repair and TEVARperformed due to blunt aortic injury. The Role of GAS6/AXL Expression in Malignant Melanoma and GI Cancers Kritika Sharma Sponsor: Amanda Kirane, M.D. MED: Surgery The interaction of two proteins, Axl and Gas6, has beenimplicated in lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers. The Axlpathway plays a significant role in resistance to immunotherapy,the treatment of disease via immune system stimulation. Gas6has been identified as the only ligand that binds theextracellular domain of Axl. Gas6 and Axl levels have beenshown to correlate strongly with the stage of cancer, overallsurvival, and recurrence patterns. However, this pathway hasnot yet been examined as a potential biomarker for response toimmunotherapy and an early indicator of melanoma progression.The goal of this study is to assess Axl expression as a clinicalcorrelate of response to therapy in malignant melanoma as wellas evaluate Gas6 as a marker of disease state and response totherapy in multiple organ tumors, including gastrointestinal (GI)and liver tumors. This is a prospective and retrospective study inwhich we'll collect blood and tumor tissue samples from new,qualifying patients and review samples from previously bankedpatients. These samples will be analyzed for Axl and Gas6levels. We plan to use this study as a basis for futuretherapeutic models, particularly as a potential biomarker ofresponse to immunotherapies.Impact of Milk Osteopontin Intake During Infancy on Development of Obesity Xiaotian Shen Sponsor: Bo Lonnerdal, Ph.D. mediatingdifferentiation adipose tissue, appearing at highconcentrations in human milk. Formula-fed infants exhibit asignificantly higher BMI in childhood than breast-fed infants.Therefore, we hypothesized that oral intake of milk OPN duringinfancy may regulate development of obesity. An OPN knock-out (KO) mouse model was used since OPN is abundant inmouse milk also. After male wild-type (WT) mouse pups werenursed by WT or OPN knock-out (KO) dams from postnatal day 1to 21, pups were fed regular (10% kcal from fat, control) or highfat (60% kcal from fat, HF) diets for 10 weeks. No differenceswere found in body weights or composition in WT and KOcontrol groups, and the KO HF group weighed significantlymore than the WT HF group (~8%) and had more fat than theWT HF group (~8%) by wk 10. KO HF mice were less sensitive toinsulin and glucose stimulation than WT HF mice at wk 9. Nodifferences were observed adipose tissue morphologybetween WT HF and KO HF mice. These findings suggest thatoral intake of milk OPN may lessen the risk for development ofobesity later in life. Social Recognition in Psychology The ability to recall the learned idiosyncratic identity of aconspecific is referred to as \"social recognition\". Socialrecognition is an integral component of prairie vole socialbehavior for protection, inbreeding avoidance, monogamousmate selection, and comfort. Prairie voles display aggression oraffiliation based on their lack or presence of recognition,respectively, mediated through oxytocin receptors (OXTR). Wehypothesized that a complete knockout of OXTR would result ina loss of social recognition in prairie voles. To assess thishypothesis, we used a sample of prairie voles (n = 80) recruitedin a 2-by-2 design with conditions of gonadal sex and genotype(i.e. WT and OXTR Knockout). Social recognition was assessedusing a standardized \"habituation / dishabituation\" paradigm, inwhich animals were first habituated to a novel social stimulusacross four sequential, 5-minute exposures (trials 1-4) and thenobserved for a fifth trial for a second, novel social stimulus (i.e.,\"dishabituation\"). Wild-type animals of both gonadal sexes wereexpected to follow a behavioral pattern consistent withdecreasing interest in the first stimulus across trials 1-4 with asubsequent increase in interest in trial 5. OXTR knockoutanimals of both gonadal sexes were expected to show acontrasting, divergent pattern. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 106Zebrafish Models of Viral and Hereditary Microcephaly Traci Shah, Ph.D. Chemical Engineering Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as a public health threat in 2015, warranting worldwide attention due to its association with birthdefects. ZIKV infection during pregnancy is linked with birthdefects in newborns, the most severe being microcephaly, inwhich brain and head size are significantly reduced, resulting inprofound developmental disability. The molecular mechanismsby which ZIKV infection contribute to abnormalneurodevelopment are not understood. Viral-host proteomicshave identified an interaction between the ZIKV protein NS4Aand the human protein ANKLE2. This interaction is significantbecause ANKLE2 is associated with genetic inhumans. Previous studies showed that ZIKV NS4A inducedmicrocephaly phenotypes in fruit flies in an ANKLE2-dependentmanner. In this study, we will build a vertebrate model, usingzebrafish, to further investigate how NS4A inducesmicrocephaly through interaction with ANKLE2. Using CRISPRmutagenesis we ankle2using Tol2-transgenesis we will express ZIKV NS4A. Wehypothesize that both conditions will result in similarmicrocephaly phenotypes that can be subsequently rescued byhuman ANKLE2. Learning to Look in a Pandemic: An Exploration on the Impact of Masks on Infant Facial Recognition Priyanka Shreedar Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology From birth, infants preferentially look to the faces in theirenvironment. Across the first year of life, infants prioritizedifferent regions of the face (e.g., the eyes or mouth) as variousvisual cues become more or less relevant. For example, asinfants learn language, they may prioritize their attention to themouth of a speaker (Lewkowicz & Hansen-Tift, 2012). As aresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have become apart of daily life for many Americans, raising the question: willface masks affect our ability to recognize one another? Studiesinvestigating this question have found that adults are impairedat both learning and recognizing faces with masks (Carragher &Hancock, 2020). Given the importance of faces for infants'learning, we tested whether infants would show differentiallearning and recognition patterns to masked and unmaskedfaces. Additionally, we asked parents to report on their infant'sexperience seeing people wear face masks. To date, we havetested approximately 50 infants aged 4- to 12-months onlineand are currently analyzing this data to present in the Spring.This work will contribute to our understanding of how variousaspects of facial input are related to infants' learning across thefirst year of life.Hyaluronidase Availability in Emergency Rooms: A Californian Census Taylor Silva Sponsor: Lee Pu, M.D.,Ph.D. MED: Surgery Injection of hyaluronic acid soft tissue fillers is a popularnonsurgical aesthetic procedure. While it is generally regardedto be safe, severe complications do exist, most notably skinischemia/necrosis and blindness, which occur secondary toiatrogenic occlusion of vessels. These complications necessitateprompt injection of hyaluronidase (an enzymatic reversal agentthat breaks down hyaluronic acid fillers). The authors sought todetermine the immediate availability of hyaluronidase amongCalifornian ERs, as well as the institutional and geographicalpredictors of hyaluronidase availability. The authors conducteda scripted telephone survey inquiring about hyaluronidaseavailability for all Californian ERs. Using a 2 test, theproportions of hyaluronidase availability were compared usingdifferent parameters. A Mann-Whitney U test was used tocompare median bed counts between hospitals that hadhyaluronidase available and those that did not. The presentstudy included 330 Californian ERs and achieved an 89.7%response rate (n=296). Overall, 45.6% of ERs were found to nothave immediate access to hyaluronidase. Ultimately,hyaluronidase availability in ERs is unreliable across the state ofCalifornia, posing a risk to patient safety as ERs are oftenexpected to function as a safety net for hyaluronic acid fillerischemic complications. Examining Speech Toward Alexa versus humans: A comparison of adults and children Sarah Simpson Sponsor: Georgia Zellou, Ph.D. Linguistics Voice assistants such as Alexa and Siri are now commonly usedin the home and everyday life, yet our scientific understandingof these interactions is still in its infancy. This study tests howpeople of different ages (college-age adults and children, ages7-12) talk to an Alexa device versus a human. The interactions,conducted over Zoom due to social distancing restrictions, werecontrolled so that participants said the same sentences to theAlexa and human interlocutors. Subjects see a list of 24 wordsand, on each trial, the experimenter or device asks what thenext word on the list is. The subject replies with thecorresponding word on their list (\"The word is pig\"). Then, theexperimenter or device says the word back and asks the subjectto repeat the sentence; on 4/24 of trials, the interlocutormishears the pronunciation, saying a second word with aconsonant error (\"I heard pig or pick\"). Videos are annotated inELAN and manually checked. We predict that adults andchildren will show differences in the way they adjust theirspeech for a human versus Alexa interlocutor. Broadly, this workcan reveal the impact of voice assistants on language behavioracross the lifespan.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 107Genomic ablation of rhesus macaque Yiu, Center Our lab has been utilizing CRISPR-based genome editing technology to develop potential gene therapy for retinaldisorders. We previously identified single guide RNAs (gRNAs)targeting exon 1 of the vascular endothelial mice, rhesus macaques, anddemonstrated efficient VEGF suppression in mouse retina. Here,we evaluate the efficacy of this CRISPR system to edit VEGFAgene in the rhesus and human genome using a cell-free and and 43.0 and 45.0 for V2, humangenome. Language, notation & meaning: Children's articulation of emergent fraction ideas Reshmika Singh Sponsor: Rebecca Ambrose, Ph.D. Education This research will focus on children's use of academic languagewhen discussing fractions. It is also focused on theirmathematical thinking related to fractions. Research indicatesthat if fractions are to be learnt from a deeper understanding,students need to understand the concept of whole numbers. Anunderstanding of fractions is important to lay a foundation forstudents to understand more advanced mathematical concepts.In order to conduct this research, we will be analyzing themathematical language used by 3 to 10 third- fifth graders (ages10 to 12) in interview contexts. The aim is to see how childrenuse language to express their interpretations of fractions. Thehypothesis is that children tend to be imprecise when talkingabout fractions which can lead to misconceptions. This analysisis intended to provide teachers with examples to consider sothey can do a better job of supporting students in learning thelanguage and concepts of fractions.Perinatal Exposure to Secondhand Smoke on Susceptibility to Viral Infection and Bacterial Challenge. Neha Singh Sponsor: Kent Pinkerton, Ph.D. MED: Pediatrics Secondhand smoke (SHS), also referred to as passive smokeexposure, is a common malady in our society. In early life, it hasbeen estimated more than 40% of children are exposed to SHS,typically in the home. However, the impact of early life exposureto SHS on the immune response is unclear. Thus far, initialfindings indicate that neonatal mice exposed to SHS with viraland subsequent bacterial challenge are associated with asignificantly higher incidence of mortality and a marked increasein the hyaline membrane formation. I performedimmunohistochemistry to evaluate the degree of inflammationand abundance of CD4 helper, and CD8 cytotoxic T-cells in of filtered air(FA) control, FA+virus+bacteria, and SHS+virus+bacteria. Lungtissues were evaluated by measuring extent following histological sites: pleura, CD8 cellsare more abundant in mice exposed to SHS+virus+bacteriacompared to FA+virus+bacteria. Both treatment groups aredifferent from FA control groups to suggest a significant role ofCD4 and CD8 in the perinatal inflammatory response to SHSand viral infection. The Spread of Disinformation by Crisis Pregnancy Centers Alisha Singh Sponsor: Emily Merchant, Ph.D. Science & Technology Studies Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs) are privately owned clinics inwhich their sole purpose is to dissuade a woman from obtainingan abortion. CPCs advance their goal by providing medicaladvice that sounds legitimate, but is actually false and intendedto deceive women. The tactics used to advertise to women andget them to make a visit has changed since their inception inthe 1960s. CPCs have been known to use space in phonebooks, newspapers, and billboards to reach women. Within thesurge of social media and online advertising, CPCs havediscovered new frontiers to spread their misinformation. Thispaper reviews literature on CPCs use of Google Advertising totarget vulnerable women and discusses the consequences oftheir actions, as well as suggests possible remedies.Policymakers, researchers, and advocates need to be cognizantof the risks associated with the spread of misinformation aroundabortion as this prevents women from making fully informed,autonomous decisions about their health.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 108Maternal Condition and Offspring Sex Ratio in Centrocercus urophasianus Katie Smith Sponsor: Gail Patricelli, Ph.D. Evolution & Ecology Many species will invest differentially in male and female offspring by altering either the number of each sex in theirbroods or the distribution of resources and parental care. TheTrivers-Willard hypothesis states that females in lekkingpolygynous systems will allocate parental investment accordingto their own characteristics and changes in the environment.Though this physiological mechanism has been studied acrosstaxa, it has yet to be examined in Greater sage-grouse(Centrocercus urophasianus), a species of conservation concernthat is used as a model organism for research on lekkingsystems. I will measure female stress endocrinology,morphometrics, age, and temporal egg laying strategies in orderto determine the predictive power that maternal condition andexperience may have on male biases in offspring sex ratios.Quantifying this relationship will elucidate the underlyingphysiology of brood demographics, and through thisunderstanding, the broader implications that anthropogenicstressors may pose on population success. California Education Funding in Context: How Supplemental and Concentration Grant Funding Varies by School District Demographics Samuel Snelson Sponsor: Jacob Hibel, Ph.D. Sociology Past research has found mixed results on the supportCalifornia's 2013 educational funding reform has provided. Theonly consensus is more attention is needed to foster andpractice educational equity. However, research is limited onhow districts' demographic context influences their spendingpriorities for disadvantaged students - namely, districts' use ofsupplemental and concentration grants which are provided todistricts with high percentages of foster youth, English learning,and/or free or reduced meal eligible students. This study usesCalifornia school districts' Local Control and Accountability Plans(LCAPs) and the American Community Survey on Education(ACS-ED) between 2013-14 and 2018-19. Using computationaltext-analysis and quantitative methods, this study investigateshow supplemental and concentration grants vary by districts' (1)total budgets, (2a) demographic composition - including race,socioeconomic status and district enrollment, and (2b)contextual factors - including residential property value/type andarea classification. A better empirical understanding of therelationship between districts' supplemental and concentrationfunding and their surrounding demographic environment mayequip California officials and administrators to better evaluatethe efficacy of their endeavors for educational equity. Finally,this study discusses the methodological utility of LCAPs for theoversight of and research on education funding.The Impact of Fire and Human Development on Wildlife Activity in the Santa Monica Mountains, California Talia Soalt Sponsor: Justine Smith, Ph.D. Wildlife & Fisheries Biology The frequency, size, and severity of wildfires in California areincreasing, likely due to a recent history of fire suppression andclimate change. A changing fire regime has the potential todisrupt wildlife behavior, including activity and habitat use. Thismay present particular challenges for wildlife that are alsosubject to pressures from humans in urban systems. One suchsystem, the Santa Monica Mountains, is a chaparral-dominated,montane ecoregion adjacent to Los Angeles, California, thewestern third of which burned in the mixed severity Springs Fireof 2013. In addition to this recent fire, wildlife in this systemcontend with habitat fragmentation and urbanization. Using datacollected from remote camera traps in 2014, I investigatedwildlife activity relative to fire and human development byapplying generalized linear models to estimate detection rates. Ifocused my analysis on mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) because little is known about the impact of fire and urbanizationon this species. Additionally, I included coyotes (Canis latrans)as a focal species, as they are a main predator in this system.As wildfires and population densities increase in California, myfindings will offer insights into how wildlife navigate thesecomplex challenges. A Comparison of Negative Affect and Vocalizations Among Infants Developing ASD and Risk for ADHD Sponsor: Meghan Miller, Ph.D. MED: Psychiatry & Behav Sci Although symptom profiles are distinct, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) frequently co-occur and exhibit some overlappingsymptoms that likely originate from shared developmentalpathways. Better understanding early manifestations of ASD andADHD symptoms may result in earlier identification andintervention. This study sought to determine whether there aredifferences in frequencies of vocalizations and negative affectamong infants developing ASD, ADHD Concerns, or neither.Infants at familial risk for ASD (n=85), familial risk for ADHD(n=37), or low-risk for both (n=35) were recruited at 12 or 18months of age and followed prospectively at 12, 18, 24, and 36months. At 36 months infants were classified into one of threeoutcome categories: ASD (n=24), ADHD Concerns (n=19), orNon-ASD/Non-ADHD Comparison (n=114). each visit, infantswere video recorded during a standardized developmentalassessment from which five-minute segments were coded forfrequencies of vocalizations and negative affect. Resultsindicated more frequent negative affect, across ages, amonginfants with ADHD Concerns outcomes and more frequentvocalizations among those with both ASD and ADHD Concernsoutcomes. Early patterns of negative affect and vocalizationsmay help identify later ASD and ADHD Concerns which couldhelp lead to earlier identification and intervention.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 109Narrative Medicine: Accessibility and Potential Tool for Pre-Health Education Felicia Song Sponsor: Amy Clarke, Ph.D. University Writing Program Narrative Medicine (NM) argues for an approach to healthcare based in the ethical and humanitarian function of stories andstorytelling to alleviate conflicts arising from a historicallyinstilled ethic of detached objectivity in medicine and more. It isa dedication to improve clinical care that draws from the studyof the liberal arts, a form of interdisciplinary approach that seeksto enhance skills of listening, empathy, critical analysis, culturalhumility, affirm humanistic relationships between patients andtheir providers, and finally, answer the question of \"What mightmedicine be for?\" Such study has salient potential to reimaginehealthcare to be more ethical, holistic, as well as provideadequate frameworks for professional/aspiring professionals toreflect meaningfully on their work. My study analyzes theaccessibility and anecdotally transformative effects of NM-based education by andmethodology and interviews withaffiliated medical students/healthcare professionals who havestudied NM either directly or indirectly through Columbia's NMprogram, workshops, and research. I will also examine andadvocate for an alternative or informal education that isaccessible and critical at an undergraduate level throughinterviews of pre-health students that fortify their clinicalexperiences through NM or pillars within NM study. Identifying Trends in Research and Technology using Natural Language Processing Patrick Soong Sponsor: Setareh Rafatirad, Ph.D. Engr Computer Science This paper discusses the idea of using natural languageprocessing to identify trends in technological research anddevelopment by extracting key terms and their semanticmeanings from publication titles and text corpus. We processedthe texts by training a Word2Vec model to extract key terms, orn-grams, from a text corpus composed of Google Scholardocuments. The key terms are then correlated with temporaldata and a label obtained from the Gartner's Hype Cycle for\"Emerging Technologies'' in order to identify trends between atechnology's popularity and research and developmentprogress. We select a classification model to classify thedocument's topic in a technological domain, and then use a timeseries model to predict the trend of a specific document withinthe technological domain. We present experimental resultsexploring the feasibility of developing a recommendationsystem to help guide researchers in selecting new technologiesand domains for their research purposes.The Disproportionate Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Latinx Community's Health and Finances Jessica Soto Sponsor: Marcella Gonsalves, Ed.D. MED: Public Health Sciences Health disparities, defined as differences in health outcomesacross different groups of people, have long beenacknowledged as a problem in the United States. Thesedisparities are driven by social determinants of health:conditions in the environments in which people are born, live,learn, work, and age. More specifically, individuals within theLatinx community face many health disparities due to theirenvironments and barriers to healthcare. These healthdisparities may have been exacerbated by the COVID-19pandemic. A literature review was conducted using scholarlyand reputable gray literature in order to identify how theCOVID-19 pandemic affected the Latinx community's health andeconomic situation and to define potential underlying reasons.Preliminary findings may suggest that members of the Latinxcommunity are more likely to have jobs that put them at greaterrisk for contracting COVID-19 and to experience a decrease inwages or job loss. Identifying health disparities during apandemic allows the public health community to betterunderstand the effects of the pandemic and to address theseeffects during and after the pandemic. Ensuring the Safety of Deep Neural Network-Based Artificial Intelligence Applications Matthew Engr Computer Science solve artificial intelligence problems bymimicking the neural wiring architecture of our brains. Theyhave made new applications, such as self-driving cars, possible.However, they are inherently difficult for people --- even theirdesigners --- to understand and predict. This raises manyconcerns about the safety and fairness of such applications. Ourwork extends the tools of program analysis to work on suchartificial intelligence systems. Using these tools, we can predictexactly how an artificial intelligence system will react to aninfinite number of possible situations. This allows us to checkthat such systems will always behave safely, even in rare orunseen scenarios. If the possibility of unsafe behavior isidentified, our approach can also be used to explain why thenetwork is behaving in that way. Finally, we also provide newtools to precisely target and correct such unsafe behavior. Inthis way, our work helps ensure that these powerful newartificial intelligence systems are also safe.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 110Methods Comparison for the Quantification of Inorganic Carbon in California Agricultural Soils Owen Sowerwine Sponsor: Kate Scow, Ph.D. Land Air & Water Resources Globally, soils hold around 2500 Gt of carbon, making them one of the largest carbon sinks, of which 950?Gt is inorganiccarbon. Enhanced silicate weathering in agricultural lands offersa new approach for increasing inorganic carbon in soils,necessitating robust quantification of carbon sequestrationassociated with enhanced weathering reactions. Variousmethods of quantification have been developed to measure soilinorganic carbon (SIC), but little consensus exists in the literatureon best approaches for local soil conditions. In order to provideguidance for a best method in California's agricultural soils, SICquantification techniques were compared via literature review.The parameters for determining suitability of each techniquewere cost, time per sample, environmental impact, accuracy,precision, and scalability. In addition, input from analytical labsacross the United States was gathered to identify commonlyused SIC methods. Pressure calcimetry, loss on ignition andthermogravimetric analysis were found to be most suitable foruse in California agricultural soils. These results provideguidance to policy makers and land managers as they seek toquantify SIC associated with enhanced weathering inCalifornia's working lands. Investigating the Neural Correlates that Mediate the Effect of Delay on Memory Quality James Spargo Sponsor: Charan Ranganath, Ph.D. Psychology Why do we remember some things and not others from thesame event? Research has found that over time, central details(CD) of a narrative are better retained than peripheral details(PD), though it is unclear which regions of the brain areresponsible for this memory retention. Our study attempts toinvestigate how memory for events changes over time andidentify the brain regions associated with retention. Participantsin this study watched two short-movies while undergoing anfMRI scan. One of the movies was recalled immediately and theother was recalled after a 2-day delay. Then, the audiorecordings of the recalled movies were scored for CD and PD.Using the scored recall, we calculated the correlation betweenbrain activity during movie viewing and the quality ofsubsequent retrieval. Our behavioral findings were congruentwith prior research - participants remembered fewer details aftera 2-day delay compared to the immediate delay with CD betterpreserved over the delay than PD. Interestingly, we foundhippocampal activity at the event boundaries during encodingcorrelated with memory for CD at the 2-day delay, but not theinitial recall. This data suggests that hippocampal activity isimportant for retention of the gist of events.Access to Emergency Contraception and Abortion Pills at California Family Planning Clinics Sanghavi Srinivasan Sponsor: Eleanor Schwarz, M.D. MED: Int Med - when desired\u2014is a risk to a woman's health.Emergency contraception (EC) pills taken within 5 days of sexcan prevent pregnancy. Levonorgestrel (Plan B ) EC pills are available throughout the United States without a prescription,but the more effective ulipristal (ella) EC pills require aprescription. When undesired pregnancy occurs, abortion pills(mifepristone and misoprostol) can be safely used up to 11weeks gestation. We assessed Californian family planningclinics' ability to provide EC and abortion pills to women seekingassistance by phone by performing a cross-sectional \"secretshopper\" survey of a 20% random sample, stratified by county,of clinics participating in California's Family Planning AccessCare and Treatment program. Of the 208 clinics we contacted,71% offered Plan B, 29% provided ella, and 12% indicated theywould be able to provide abortion pills if needed. Aconsiderable number of phone staff were not sure how torespond to women calling with a time-sensitive need for familyplanning services; specifically, 17%, 48%, and 34% did not knowif their clinic offered Plan B, Ella, and abortion pills, respectively.Efforts remain needed to increase access to EC and abortionpills for Californian families. Hey Bro, Do You Even Take the Lift?: Semantic and Phonological Factors Affecting Cross-Dialect Intelligibility of Speech in Noise Riley Stray Sponsor: Georgia Zellou, Ph.D. Linguistics Dialects, regional varieties of a language, differ both in howwords are pronounced and which words are used in whichsituations; for example, American speakers often use the word\"rubber\" to refer to a material while British speakers may say itreferring to an eraser. We utilized \"false friends,'' words acrossdialects/languages with the same form but different meaning, toinvestigate how semantic factors interact with phonology inlexical access. We created semantically-predictable sentencesthat cue American or British meanings, generated our sentencesspoken by American and British synthetic voices, and presentedthem to study participants who listened and wrote the last wordthey heard. Responses were coded for accuracy and our results,modeled with a mixed effects logistic regression, showedgreater intelligibility of the British synthetic voice (p<0.001),greater intelligibility for the sentences cueing Americanmeanings (p<0.001), and higher accuracy for sentences wherethe spoken dialect and lexical dialect were aligned (p<0.05).Overall, results suggest both phonological and semanticproperties of words contribute to speech intelligibility acrossdialects, agreeing with previous studies that a listener's pastexperience with an individual word can affect how that item isparsed when strongly associated with a certain dialect.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 111Measuring the Effectiveness of Undergraduate Teaching Assistants to Analyze Differences in Instruction in Chemistry Laboratories Muhammad Sulman Sponsor: Ozcan Gulacar, Ph.D. Chemistry Beginning in Fall 2017, the Chemistry Department at UC Davis established a pilot program through which undergraduateteaching assistants, formally known as Emerging Scholars (ES),are introduced into laboratory settings to work alongsidegraduate teaching assistants (TA). To study the differences instudent interactions with the TAs and the ESs, every TA and ESwas asked to audio record their conversations during two labsessions. After the audio data were collected, they were firsttranscribed, and student interactions with the lab instructorswere coded using Laboratory Observation Protocol forUndergraduate STEM (LOPUS). The findings of this study willreveal whether students are more comfortable approaching TAsor ESs, and how the teaching styles may vary between the twolab instructors. Student inquiries and TA's or ES's responses willbe carefully examined to better understand the instructionalstyles in the labs. These observations and analyses will revealthe efficacy of the Emerging Scholars program and provideinsight on methods to enhance student learning experiences. Expanding Biodesign Education and Outreach Kiyomi Sun Sponsor: John Furlow, Physio & Behavior is a growing, multidisciplinary field that aims to createmore sustainable products by exploring biological mechanismsto solve global issues. The aim of this research project is todiscover optimal ways to get students interested in andinvolved with biodesign, as well as support their efforts to turntheir ideas into careers. This ongoing research will utilizeinterviews with educators in fields related to biodesign,programs such as the Biodesign Challenge that inspirebiodesign innovation, as well as students and entrepreneurswho are currently working on biodesign products. Based on theinformation gathered from these sources, interactive problem-solving workshops and interview videos illustrating the designprocess will be created. These resources will help educatorsdetermine the best types of programs, such as implementing abiodesign major or minor, or implementing a problem-basedapproach to biodesign in course activities, would best benefittheir students, and inspire them to further develop their ideas. Parenting Effects on Language Development in Mexican- American and Chinese-American Dual Language Learners Qianya Sun Sponsor: Yuuko Tonkovich, Ph.D. Education Past research has found mixed results on the relation betweenparenting styles and the development of young children'slanguage skills. More research is needed with dual languagelearners (DLLs) to promote bilingual development, especially tomaintain their heritage language skills. This project wasanchored to examine parenting styles and practices in familieswith DLLs and to investigate the association between parentingstyles (authoritarian and authoritative) and parenting practices(amount of parent-child activities) and their collective effects onMexican American (MA) children and Chinese American (CA)DLLs' oral comprehension and vocabulary retention of heritagelanguage, controlling for confounders of parental languagedominance and parental educational levels. Data were collectedfrom a total of 55 MA and 64 CA DLLs enrolled in Head Startprograms and their first-generation parents. Parenting Stylesand Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) and demographic surveywere completed by parents to investigate parenting styles andparenting practices. MA and CA DLLs were assessed on theirheritage language oral proficiency. Preliminary results suggestthat parenting styles and practices were similar for MA and CAparents and parenting practices were more associated withchildren's heritage language development than parenting styles.Implications for families will be discussed. Chronic Failures in California's Wildfire Mobile Alert System Brendan Sweeney Sponsor: Mark Verbitsky, Ph.D. Political Science California faces increasingly frequent, dangerous wildfires thatencroach on densely populated areas. To save lives, localgovernment increasingly target mobile devices to issueevacuation orders and warnings. Two of California's fivedeadliest wildfires have occurred in the past five years despitemobile alert innovations; both fires were marked by massivefailures to effectively alert residents using mobile devices. Ireview disaster communications literature to identify the keycomponents of an effective mobile alert. Effective systems relyon a diverse set of notification tools, follow a clear set ofcontent standards, and target a sufficiently broad population.These elements increase the level of public risk perception,spurring protective action from residents. I consider recentwildfires in three Northern California counties, Sonoma, Butte,and Yolo, in the context of effective mobile alerts. They sharean identical pattern of failures. Those failures includeoverreliance on opt-in alert tools, poor use of the nationalWireless Emergency Alert system, and a lack of non-Englishlanguage emergency alerts. Sonoma, Butte, and Yolo countieshave made or are making progress in addressing these failures,but only after catastrophes. I recommend steps California mighttake to preempt this pattern of reform after predictable, deadlyfailures.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 112Inughuit, Polar Explorers, and Glass Beads in late 19th and early 20th Century Northwestern Greenland Michael Sze Sponsor: Christyann Darwent, Ph.D. Anthropology The Inglefield Land Archaeology Project archaeological excavations at the site of Iita, in northwesternGreenland in 2006, 2012, and 2016. Occupation of Iita spansthe past 1000 years, but the focus here is on the contact period.Among the historical items recovered from this Inughuit sitewere numerous glass beads. These are likely associated withDonald MacMillan's Crocker Land Expedition, which resided atIita between 1913 and 1917. However, they could also date toearlier arctic explorers, including the North Pole expeditions ofRobert Peary and Matthew Hensen. This study aims to provide amore detailed analysis of these beads by comparing the stylistictype patterns found within Iita to bead assemblages foundelsewhere in the eastern North American Arctic, with the goal oftracing their provenance. The presence of glass beads at Iita isparticularly interesting because unlike most Inuit groups whointeracted with European and American traders, Inughuit neverincorporated trade beads into their clothing. Intraoperative (FLIm) for Real-Time Label-Free Delineation of Oropharyngeal Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Origin Athena Tam Sponsor: Laura Marcu, Ph.D. Biomedical Engineering Oropharyngeal carcinoma of unknown primary origin is a rarehead and neck cancer afflicting approximately 3,000 patientsannually. These tumors are challenging to detect and cannot beidentified after exhaustive clinical, radiographic, and surgicalevaluation. Successful patient outcomes depend on thecomplete removal of these tumors, however low detection rateshave motivated the search for novel approaches to facilitate thedetection and excision of these elusive tumors. Herein, weinvestigate the use of multi-spectral Fluorescence LifetimeImaging instrument integrated into the da Vinci SP transoralrobotic surgical platform (TORS) to delineate these tumorcohorts. Intraoperative measurementswere vivo tonsil and base oftongue tissues on N=8 patients at the UCDMC presenting withmetastatic SCC to the head and neck with unknown primarysite. Machine learning was used to assign spectroscopic pointmeasurements to a healthy vs. cancer prediction. Bilateraltonsillectomy and base of tongue excision procedures werethen performed and used for histopathological validation.Carcinoma was successfully located and excised in 4 patients(50%). Collectively, FLIm demonstrated a mean sensitivity of 90\u00b111.1% and specificity of 92 \u00b17.8%, indicating excellentdiscrimination and demonstrating promising preliminary resultsfor aiding intraoperative surgical decision-making.Theoretical and Practical Analysis of Structural Mechanics for STEM Education Yash Taneja Sponsor: Mohamed Hafez, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The physics and mathematics behind engineering problems areoften taught in the classroom without supplemental hands-on,physical learning. To help fill this gap, the physics, analyticalsolution, numerical solution, and experimental correlation forthree simple structural engineering phenomena---tension in acable, bending of a beam, and buckling of a beam---areexplored and derived in full. It is rare in STEM to have this abilityto observe, understand, and correlate all these aspects ofmodern engineering problems, and this research serves tocapitalize on this unique opportunity. From learning about theseproblems, it is apparent that they can all be modeled asordinary differential equations with well-known analytical andnumerical solving techniques. This research clearlydemonstrates that the practical experimental results areconsistent with the theoretical analytical and numerical results,which is a simple but powerful conclusion to draw for STEMeducation. With these results, new students in the area caneasily observe the synergistic effect of how a conceptualphenomenon, rooted in physics and mathematics, can bemodeled and proven in real-life with relevant applications. Evolutionary and Sequence Analysis of Putative Genes Associated with Nitrogen Use in Wheat Joana Tanurahardja Sponsor: Diane Beckles, Ph.D. Plant Sciences Wheat provides 20% of the calories consumed by humans andis grown on almost every continent on earth. Nitrogenousfertilizer is used to promote wheat yield and quality, but it isexpensive, and harmful to the environment, contributing togreenhouse gases and eutrophication of natural waterways.Therefore, improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), i.e., theproportion of nitrogen taken up from the soil and converted towheat biomass is important. Through QTL mapping, a region ofthe wheat genome potentially associated with NUE wasdiscovered. Some of the genes in this region may be related tonitrogen and nutrient uptake; however, they have not beencharacterized or, have not been studied in wheat. In this work,we will perform a full bioinformatics analysis of three candidategenes in this region. Evolutionary, sequence and proteinanalyses will be performed using an array of available tools.These data will build a foundation of the important informationneeded to help prioritize the genes for functional in-lab testing,to determine their potential contribution to NUE in wheat.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 113Social Development in a Rodent Model of Maternal Autoantibody Related (MAR) Autism Allyson Tayag Sponsor: Melissa Bauman, Ph.D. MED: Psychiatry & Behav Sci Alterations in the prenatal immune environment are associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Herewe present a preclinical rodent model to investigate onepotential cause of ASD - maternal autoantibodies targeting fetalbrain tissue that are present in a subset of mothers of childrenwith ASD. Although ASD is a uniquely human disorder, animalmodels can be used to study the effects of maternalautoantibody-related (MAR) autism on social development,which is typically altered in individuals with ASD. In this study,rat offspring exposed to MAR antibodies throughout gestationwere compared to control offspring in a social dyad (SD). Onpost-natal day (PND) 36 (+/- 1 day), test rats (n= 56 MAR-treated,n= 28 control) were assigned to age- and sex-matched stimulusrats and tested together. Interactions were video-recorded andcoded to assess social play behavior within each pair byobserving the frequency of play behavior (nape attacks) duringa 10-minute test. We hypothesize that MAR-treated rats willengage less in social play and exhibit a lower nape attackfrequency compared to control rats. Studying the social playbehaviors of MAR-treated rats will provide new insight into theneurobiological consequences of prenatal exposure to MARantibodies. Management of Invasive Paterson's Curse ( Echium plantagineum Herbicides Anr Plant Sciences Paterson's curse, Echium plantagineum, is a flowering plantnative to Mediterranean Europe and northern Africa. It has beenreported to be a significant invasive weed in large portions ofAfrica, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, andUruguay. In the United States, Paterson's curse, also known asvipers bugloss, has been reported in Massachusetts, New York,Pennsylvania, Oregon, and California. While not currently amajor weed in California, its impact on agriculture and livestockin other non-native regions is reason enough to be concerned.The purpose of this study is to obtain data on herbicidal controloptions for Patterson's curse in California. Particularly, the studyfocuses on herbicides originally tested on the long establishedAustralian invasive population as well as testing theeffectiveness of herbicides more commonly used in the UnitedStates for controlling broadleaf weeds in grasslands. It isexpected that all fourteen postemergence herbicides tested in agreenhouse environment will significantly reduce growth ofPaterson's curse. Developing data on the performance ofherbicides registered in the US could provide land managerswith information about options for managing Paterson's cursebefore it becomes a more widespread problem.Small-Molecule Ph.D. Microbiology & Molec Genetics Over the course of one's lifetime, DNA damage occurs as aresult of both external factors and internal cellular processes. Awide variety of cellular pathways serve to remove or toleratethis damage, promoting genomic stability. is anendonuclease, a DNA-cleaving responsible forrepairing DNA double-strand breaks - a particularly hazardousform of damage. Although it is non-essential in normal humancells, many cancer cell lines are dependent on the enzyme. Ihave been working in the Heyer laboratory to identify small-molecule inhibitors of MUS81-EME1 with the potential to bedeveloped into a drug. Our laboratory has developed afluorescence-based assay to measure the activity ofendonucleases which is compatible with high throughputscreening (HTS), a technique allowing for the testing of largenumbers of small molecules. At present, I am in the process ofpurifying samples of protein to be used in our next HTScampaign. After the next round of screening is complete, we willfurther investigate any promising candidates. The Effect of Nighttime Chilling Stress on Arabidopsis thaliana Leaf Starch Natalie Tehranchi Sponsor: Diane Beckles, Ph.D. Plant Sciences Nighttime chilling stress (NCS) can affect crop yield and quality,hurting agricultural production. Temperature-related stress canresult in hindered photosynthetic machinery, thereby affectingplant respiration and growth. In order to combat abiotic stress,more sugar is accumulated within plant leaves to reduce thefreezing temperature of the cells within the plant. The source ofthis sugar is presently unknown. During the day, carbon isaccumulated via photosynthesis and is stored in leaves asstarch; this starch is then degraded into sugars at night tocontinue metabolic functions. In this study, it is hypothesizedthat Arabidopsis thaliana plants subjected to short-term NCS willhave decreased levels of leaf starch, as a result of starchconversion to sugar. In order to investigate NCS, plantssubjected to 4\u00b0C in the stressed condition were compared tothe control temperature of 18\u00b0C at night. Starch levels wereassayed during various intervals over 24-h. If the cold-treatedplants have decreased starch, then it is hypothesized that starchwas degraded to increase leaf sugar content as a response tothe NCS. The data from this experiment will be presented.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 114Genes, Transposons, and Recombination in Selected Plant Genomes Camille Tenyenhuis Sponsor: Luca Comai, Ph.D. Plant Biology Chromosomes are complex genetic structures containing identifiable elements such as genes and transposons. DuringProphase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes can exchangesegments through the process of recombination. It is notentirely clear how genes and transposons affect recombination.Previous studies in plants and animals have shown that along achromosome, recombination frequency tends to be positivelycorrelated with genes and negatively correlated withtransposons. Chromosomes can differ in number, size, andcomposition between the genomes of different species.Understanding how the density of genes, transposons, andrecombination events vary within chromosomes of different sizeand organization is important because these properties affectgenome maintenance and evolution. Here we show thecomparative distributions of genes and transposons within thechromosomes species: Solanum lycopersicum, as well of recombination frequency in A. thaliana and S.lycopersicum. We found an inverse relationship between geneand transposon density. Additionally, we found a positiverelationship between gene density and recombinationfrequency in the two species where this was examined. Ourresults confirm past findings in other species that show arelationship between genes, transposons, and recombinationfrequency in plant genomes. Dear Sister Chloe Thepenier Sponsor: Susan Verba, M.F.A. Department Of Design Inspired by the analog information design Dear Data project byGiorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec, Dear Sister consists of ananalog infographic exchange between a Graphic Design studentin the United States and her sister, an Aerospace Engineer inFrance with a Master's Degree in Astrophysics. The main goalof the project is to explore ways to convey information relatedto space and space exploration efficiently in a restrictedpostcard format, through ten different topics. Personalreflections and processes are recorded through journaling anddocumenting. A more thorough analysis will include interviewsof the postcard makers regarding the challenges theyencountered and their takeaways, a visual analysis andcomparison of the postcards, and interviews of severalparticipants from the general public to evaluate the objective ofconveying information clearly. A preliminary hypothesis basedon the first two postcards suggests that while derived from thesame data, the interpretation and prioritization of certainelements can differ depending on the maker, creating distinctnarratives. Further analysis will assess the extent of thesevariations and the potential impact of personal bias andorganization preference on information design layout andoverall visual communication. A website will share the resultswith a wider audience.Hand to Mouth: Personal Loss, Public Health, and Inequitable Access to Dental Care in America Amanda Thomas Sponsor: Robin Hill, M.F.A. Art & Art History In \"Hand to Mouth,\" I examine inequities in dental care throughthe lens of my experience navigating America's dental caresystem. I use visual art to distill the complex connectionsbetween societal forces and personal struggle. Our dentalindustry prioritizes the vanity of the wealthy over the health ofthe poor through a broken, inequitable system. From theshortage of dentists who accept Medicaid, to the cost of dentalschool, to insurance reimbursement rates, to job insecurity, totransportation access, and eventually, to the discrimination,social stigma, and health consequences associated with missingteeth, poor oral health and poverty endlessly feed each other. Iseek to illuminate this issue, one of many manifestations ofeconomic injustice in America. My project couples paintings ofmy mouth, my x-rays in the 19th century photographic processof cyanotype, and other art works incorporating my lost teeth. Iseek to bring awareness, evoke empathy, and nullify judgmentand shame surrounding this issue. Physical evidence from mybody is juxtaposed against statistics and narrative. Dancing theline between beauty and revulsion, I mourn personal loss whilecelebrating the resilience of the human spirit. The goal of myproject is to humanize this public health crisis. The Economic Impact of Climate Change on California's Market Squid Fishery Kate Thompson Sponsor: James Sanchirico, Ph.D. Environmental Science & Policy Market Squid is the focus of this analysis, because of its well-known association with natural variations during weatherevents. When ocean temperatures rise, landings fall and thefishery is less lucrative. Eureka port rarely experiences MarketSquid landings but did in the 2014-2015 and 2018-2019 seasonsdue to heightened ocean temperatures in Southern Californiadriving the species further north to find suitable marineconditions. From 1990 to 2013 the average ocean temperatureexperienced in Santa Barbara waters was 15.88 degreesCelcius, whereas in 2013-2019 this increased to an average of16.9 degrees Celcius. Looking into the landing numbers for thisperiod and port, Santa Barbara has experienced reducedlanding numbers, much below its average of 68 million shorttons during this warmer water trend. Most fluctuations in landingnumbers can be attributed to changes in sea surfacetemperature and dissolved oxygen content. Current climatechange science predicts that sea surface temperatures will rise.36 degrees Celcius per decade in the latter half of this century.Proactive management strategies to combat variations such asthese include using harvest control rules, a quota permitsystem, and having a ranked vulnerability index for fish stock inorder to prioritize investments.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 115Quanityfing Hydrogen-Bond Accepting Ability of Organic Molecules Using 19F NMR Spectroscopy Madison Thompson Sponsor: Annaliese Franz, Ph.D. Chemistry Hydrogen bonding is a vital aspect of organocatalysis and many drug receptor interactions. Current methods to measurehydrogen bonds are time-consuming and costly. This research proposes a new method using either 19F or 31P NMR spectroscopy, utilizing commercially available, inexpensive acid (PPA)probes. Over 110 medicinally fragments heterocycles such aspyridines, quinolines, and benzotetramisoles, were examined indichloromethane with a variety of steric and electronicmodifications. In addition, the hydrogen bonding ability of selectdrug molecules, organocatalysts, and ligands were quantified.Hydrogen bonding measurements showed correlationswith Hammett parameters and proton transfer basicity (pK BH+). Current work is focused on expanding solvent systems in which this method may be employed. Overall, 19F and 31P NMR spectroscopy offers a rapid and simple tool to quantify HBA abilities, which will contribute to the understanding of hydrogenbonding in the design of novel bioisosteres and organocatalystsfor drug discovery and catalysis. Davis Journal of Legal Studies: the Advancement of Legal Discourse, Public Scholarship, and Interdisciplinary Study through Undergraduate Publication Emma Tolliver Sponsor: Lisa-jane Klotz, Ph.D. University Writing Program In higher education, there is a lack of accessible publicationopportunities for undergraduate students, and this lack ofopportunity is even more apparent in the fields of socialsciences and humanities. With the establishment of DavisJournal of Legal Studies (DJLS), I am working to create anundergraduate, interdisciplinary journal that publishes researchrelated to legal studies; thus, this will provide an opportunity forpublication at the undergraduate level. Modeled after UC DavisKing Hall Law Review and Stanford Law Review, Davis Journalof Legal Studies seeks to advance undergraduate legaldiscourse and empower undergraduate students by publishinginterdisciplinary legal research. Davis Journal of Legal Studiesalso seeks to create a community of undergraduate legalscholars and provide valuable experience in academic writing,editing, and research that students can use in their educationaland professional pursuits. The journal is a work of publicscholarship; it will be publicly and freely accessible online and inUC Davis Shields Library. Volume 1 of Davis Journal of LegalStudies will be published in April 2021. It will be available toread during this presentation.Phase I/II Trial of BMS-986205 and Nivolumab as First Line Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Kyra Toomey Sponsor: Tianhong Li, M.D. MED: Int Med Hem/Onc Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide and incidence of HCC is rising.Sorafenib and lenvatinib are approved for first-line use inunresectable HCC; however, survival benefit remains low Nivolumab, a human monoclonal antibody toprogrammed death-1 (PD-1) receptor, has been approved including HCC, and has been shown to play acentral role in immune suppression within the tumormicroenvironment.

This project to 240mg inunresectable toevaluate safety and tolerability, and to determine efficacydefined by objective response rate. Secondary objectives are toevaluate disease control rate, duration of response, progressionfree survival, and overall survival. Patients will be followed for100 days after the last dose of treatment or until all treatment-related clinical toxicities resolve to baseline or grade = 1. A Qualitative Analysis: A Look at the Effects of Gender and Cultural Variables in Intimate Partner Violence Among Latinas Gabriella Torres-Valencia Sponsor: Laura Grindstaff, Ph.D. Sociology Intimate partner violence (IPV) is considered a global publichealth issue. The CDC defines IPV as \"sexual violence, physicalviolence, stalking, or psychological harm by a current or formerpartner or spouse.\" According to the National Latina Network,one in three Latinas will experience IPV during her lifetime, areless likely to report their abuse and less likely to seek helpversus non-Latina women. The two key sociological literaturesfor understanding IPV represent the \"family violenceperspective\" on the one hand and the \"feminist perspective\" onthe other. The former looks at the family as a subculture withparticular norms, values, and practices specific to the family; thelatter, by contrast, sees violence against women as an outcomeof patriarchal gender relations more broadly. This study aims toexpand on the literature by providing an inside look on thegender roles and cultural variables that Latinas must maneuverwithin their relationship(s) via interviews. I ultimately argue thatan intersectional, feminist lens is critical to understanding theexperiences of Latinas with respect to IPV, but that, because ofthe centrality of the \"la familia\" in Latinx culture, the \"familyviolence\" perspective has something to contribute as well. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 116Using CRISPR-Cas9 to Identify Genes Involved in Haustorium parasitic plants in the family Orobanchaceae can be devastating agricultural weeds. Our research is directed towarddeveloping a genetic based strategy to control these pests. Weuse Triphysaria versicolor as a model parasite for this familybecause it is non-weedy, easy to work with, and amenable tomolecular genetic studies. Parasitic plants rely on an organknown as a haustorium to attach, invade, and acquire resourcesfrom host plants. We have identified eight genes with predictedfunctions in haustorium development. To investigate the rolethese genes play in haustorium development, we are using thegenome-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9, to disable the function ofthese genes. We first transform our CRISPR-Cas9 constructsinto T. versicolor roots to introduce mutations in the coding sequences of the target genes. We then evaluate the ability ofmutated roots to develop haustoria and observe for anyabnormal haustoria development. This research will identifygenes and pathways necessary for haustorium development,which could be used to engineer host resistance by silencinghaustoria-related genes. Operationalizing Social Environments in Cognitive a phrase commonly used torefer to social determinants of health (e.g., neighborhoodcharacteristics) that operate at the broad, ecological level. Whilethe \"built environment\" is clearly operationalized in empiricalstudies as physical surroundings made by and for humans, the\"social environment\" remains ambiguous. Theoretical andempirical definitions of social environments have encompassedvaried interpersonal (e.g., social network structures) and socialexposures (e.g., aggregate measures of socioeconomic status)that operate at different levels of analysis with presumablydifferent mechanistic processes. This scoping review aims toexamine how social environments are operationalized and theireffects on cognition, cognitive decline, mild cognitiveimpairment, or dementia. We performed a systematic search onPubMed and Web of Science using MeSH and keyword terms toidentify observational/epidemiological studies investigatingsocial environments as a risk or protective factor for late-lifecognitive outcomes. Of 7,714 identified studies, 85 met theinclusion criteria based on title and abstract. The findings ofthese studies will be contextualized within public health,sociological and gerontological theories of social environmentand will be used to develop a framework to advance the scienceof cognitive aging and risk reduction.Galinstan materials have been studied fortheir unique physical and chemical properties. Their applicationsrange from electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. For thisstudy, the two-dimensional layered materials were grown viavapor liquid solid growth. This process utilizes a horizontal tubefurnace where the host's powder deposits onto the substratesas a vapor and cools into a layered material. Upon intercalationof a metal, the layered materials exhibit new and unexpectedphysical behaviors, including enhanced conduction, alteredopto-electronics, and varied structural behaviors. Here, wedemonstrate intercalation used to atoms into a layered host. In some instances,simultaneous intercalation of the three metals is achievedthough selective intercalation is demonstrated depending uponthe host layered material. This intercalation chemistry achieves anovel route to place metals inside layered hosts. Nitrate Photodegradation in Snow Theodore Tran Sponsor: Cort Anastasio, Ph.D. Land Air & Water Resources Deposited snow has shown to be photochemically active asreactions in sunlit snowpacks produce a variety of trace gases.Our focus is on nitrate photolysis in snow which can change itsconcentration and acts as a tracer for atmospheric pollution inice cores. Some studies have shown that photochemicalreactions occur faster in the quasi-liquid layer (at the air-iceinterface) compared to the liquid-like regions (at grainboundaries of the ice matrix) but slowest in aqueous solutions.However, this phenomenon has not been studied in great detailand current studies do not always agree. That is why we wantto simulate the reaction in snow which is a truer representationof environmental conditions than simply freezing water. In orderto do this, we have built a snow-making machine to: incorporateprinciples of supersaturated water vapor, form snow crystals,and then introduce chemicals onto the crystals.This sample isthen illuminated by an arc lamp filtered to simulate polarsunlight. Overall, nitrate photolysis in snow releases pollutantsinto the atmosphere which further perpetuates our climate crisisbut a better understanding of snow photodegradation willprovide greater insight into preventing the progression ofclimate change.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 117Technical Development and Assembly of a Modular Cubesat Kevin Tran Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr The REALOP CubeSat of the University of California, Davis team utilizes a new design that is modular and provides more accessto internal payload components. To achieve ease ofaccessibility and modularity, the structures team designedmounting brackets and a unique printed circuit board (PCB)housing unit that are easy to modify and reorganize withouthaving to take apart the whole satellite assembly. The assemblypreparation team is currently working towards a standardizedintegration plan that carefully documents the process ofassembling each payload component. A database of well-organized and detailed documents was made to tackle themultiple challenges in developing an assembly procedure thatindependently integrated each of the critical payloadcomponents, PCBs, and wire routes with the structural frame.The assembly will consist of installing deployment switches,payload components and their respective mounting brackets, X-faces, Y-faces, Z-faces, and finally solar panels. These newdesigns and standardized integration documents will be usedfor future CubeSat missions and testing. Access to Emergency Contraception and Abortion Pills at California Family Planning Clinics Isabella Trezza Sponsor: Eleanor Schwarz, M.D. MED: Int Med - Genl when desired\u2014is a risk to a woman's health.Emergency contraception (EC) pills taken within 5 days of sexcan prevent pregnancy. Levonorgestrel (Plan B ) EC pills are available throughout the United States without a prescription,but the more effective ulipristal (ella) EC pills require aprescription. When undesired pregnancy occurs, abortion pills(mifepristone and misoprostol) can be safely used up to 11weeks gestation. We assessed Californian family planningclinics' ability to provide EC and abortion pills to women seekingassistance by phone by performing a cross-sectional \"secretshopper\" survey of a 20% random sample, stratified by county,of clinics participating in California's Family Planning AccessCare and Treatment program. Of the 208 clinics we contacted,71% offered Plan B, 29% provided ella, and 12% indicated theywould be able to provide abortion pills if needed. Aconsiderable number of phone staff were not sure how torespond to women calling with a time-sensitive need for familyplanning services; specifically, 17%, 48%, and 34% did not knowif their clinic offered Plan B, Ella, and abortion pills, respectively.Efforts remain needed to increase access to EC and abortionpills for Californian families.Barriers, Challenges, And Opportunities For Improving Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Screening In An Open Healthcare System Ashley Truong Sponsor: Matthew Mell, M.D. MED: Surgery Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) screening rates remain low within the at-risk populationof 65 to 75 year old men with a smoking history or patients witha AAA family history. The purpose of our study is to determinethe barriers to identifying and screening these at-risk patients inan open healthcare system. 1031 algorithm. (45%) of these identified patients were noteligible for screening. Educational materials and a letter weresent to the remaining 563 patients. Follow-up calls were madeto encourage these patients to schedule a screening. 13.1% ofthe patients had both an invalid address and phone number.34.1% of follow-up calls were to the wrong number. Successfulcontact rate was 33.9% and having a PCP increased thechances of successful contact. 101 screening invites were madewith 34 (33.7%) scheduling a screening. The most commonreason for decline was preference to follow up with one's ownPCP. Screening at-risk patients for AAA remains achallenging goal. Collaboration with PCPs, accurate contactinformation, and a more refined screening algorithm can all playa role in increasing AAA screening rates in an open healthcaresystem. Bringing Girls and Gender-Expansive Youth Backpacking to Transform STEM Jenna Turpin Sponsor: Cynthia Ching, Ph.D. Undergraduate Education Girls' Outdoor Adventure in Leadership and Science (GOALS) isa free summer science backpacking trip for girls and gender-expansive youth traditionally underrepresented in science,technology, engineering, and math (STEM), who are referred toas scholars in the program. GOALS was dreamed up andcreated by a group of volunteers from the University ofCalifornia, Davis in partnership with the National Parks Service.Program evaluation, a committee within GOALS, seeks tounderstand each scholars' experience of the GOALS tripthrough analyzing end of trip surveys, scholar journals,Photovoice activities, demographic surveys, and a series ofsemi-structured ethnographic interviews over time. Onceanalyzed, this data will reveal if and how scholars'understanding of and identity with leadership, science, theoutdoors, and gender were transformed through GOALS.Preliminary findings suggest that particular elements of theGOALS program\u2014specifically related to social relationships andconnections to place\u2014facilitated shifts in scholar identitydevelopment. Knowing how scholars are transformed by GOALSwill improve this program to better serve future scholars, lay thegroundwork for similar programs, and ultimately work towardsopening up the STEM field to those previously excluded.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 118Characterization of differences in circadian clock function in cultivated and wild lettuce species Esha Urs Sponsor: Stacey Harmer, Ph.D. Plant Biology The plant circadian clock is an important regulatory network that coordinates internal functions with daily rhythmicenvironmental signals. In some crop species, specific clock genevariants have been selected during domestication. For example,cultivated amplitude circadian rhythms which dampenquickly in constant environmental conditions compared to wildrelative Solanum pimpinellifolium . Our objective is to determine whether there are similar differences in clock function acrossdomesticated lettuce and wild relative species. We selected seventeen lettuce accessions which represent each of six morphological classes of domesticated lettuce andsix related wild species. First, we assessed differences in thematuration rate of young seedlings from each line to coordinatethe developmental stage of tissue used in our assay. To quantifycircadian phenotypes we will use Delayed Fluorescence (DF), ahigh throughput method for measuring circadian fluctuations inautofluorescence of the chloroplasts. We will compare and the amplitude of the circadian clockacross accessions. High functioning clocks will maintain highamplitude and robust rhythms while low functioning clocks willexhibit a dampening signal over time in constant conditions. First born Latina daughters: the obstacles when learning from home Glenda Valenzuela Sponsor: Lee Martin, Ph.D. Education First born daughters in a Latinx household traditionally tend tohave more responsibilities than her siblings due to externalfactors such as culture and pressure from her parents. The aimof this study is to investigate the effect that remote learning hason first born daughters in Latinx homes. We will interview adozen girls ages 13-18 who fall into this description, theninterview one of their siblings within the same age group. Wewill compare the interviews from both groups to analyzewhether culture, gender roles, and birth order affects students'success during a pandemic, where they are forced to learn fromhome. Students' success will be measured through self-reportedend of the year grades and grade point average. We expectthere to be a significant difference in learning experiences fromboth groups, since commonly first born Latinas are given moreresponsibilities than their siblings. We predict that the first borndaughters will struggle more academically than their siblingsdue to their home and school environment being the same.Their responsibilities and expectations will make it harder forthem to focus and prioritize their academics.The Influence of Nutrient Limitation on Nucleophagy and Chromosome Stability Neha Valluri Sponsor: Kenneth Kaplan, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio The wide-range of patient outcomes in similarly graded tumorssuggests that exogenous factors might influence cancerprogression. Dietary strategies that influence nutrient availabilitymight impact genome stability by affecting the ability of the cellto successfully resolve sister-chromatids during mitosis.Failuresin sister-chromatid resolution can lead to increases inmicronuclei that directly contribute to chromosome instabilityand inflammatory responses in cancers.Micronuclei that arisefrom replication stress are predicted to be associated withrepetitive DNA elements that are some of the last to replicateand resolve in anaphase(e.g., the rDNA repeats in thenucleolus).The Kaplan lab has observed that replication stresscan induce a specialized form of nucleophagy that targetsnucleolar-proteins for degradation in the vacuole, possibly as away to maintain the organization of the rDNA-array in thenucleus and to reduce chromosome instability after replicationstress.Interestingly, a similar nucleophagy pathway has beenshown to be induced after nutrient starvation, raising thequestion of whether nutrient availability might impactchromosome stability. We hypothesize that nutrient restrictionwill enhance protection from chromosome instability followingreplication stress. To test this, we will use budding-yeast andmammalian cell-culture.We will test the prediction that thestructural organization of the nucleolar-proteins are alteredunder nutrient-limiting conditions. Investigating the Response to Health-Related Messages Over Social Media Mea Van Staden Sponsor: Debbie Fetter, Ph.D. Nutrition In the US, about 7 of 10 individuals use social media to seek outinformation. However, this widespread use of social mediameans there is an increased risk of finding false information,especially for health-related topics. Message framing is a fundamental component of communication strategy that can influence exposure of amessage. Messages can be framed to emphasize either thebenefits of engaging in a behavior (a gain-frame), theconsequences of failing to participate in behavior (a loss-frame), or the potential danger of not adoptingrecommendations (a fear appeal). This study will develop gain-framed, loss-framed, and fear- based health messages to investigate the response between apopulation with high-use of social media versus one with low-use. Participants will complete a survey about their social mediause, perceived level of knowledge about these health topics,and responses to these health messages in the differentframings. Questions will be included to measure perceivedaccuracy, how likely they would be to share the message withtheir social network, and self-efficacy towards behavior change.The results can be used to investigate how to more effectivelydisseminate health messages over social media to helpindividuals adopt beneficial behaviors.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 119Examining Speech Toward Alexa versus humans: A comparison of adults and children Madeline Vanderheid-Nye Sponsor: Georgia Zellou, Ph.D. Linguistics Voice assistants such as Alexa and Siri are now commonly used in the home and everyday life, yet our scientific understandingof these interactions is still in its infancy. This study tests howpeople of different ages (college-age adults and children, ages7-12) talk to an Alexa device versus a human. The interactions,conducted over Zoom due to social distancing restrictions, werecontrolled so that participants said the same sentences to theAlexa and human interlocutors. Subjects see a list of 24 wordsand, on each trial, the experimenter or device asks what thenext word on the list is. The subject replies with thecorresponding word on their list (\"The word is pig\"). Then, theexperimenter or device says the word back and asks the subjectto repeat the sentence; on 4/24 of trials, the interlocutormishears the pronunciation, saying a second word with aconsonant error (\"I heard pig or pick\"). Videos are annotated inELAN and manually checked. We predict that adults andchildren will show differences in the way they adjust theirspeech for a human versus Alexa interlocutor. Broadly, this workcan reveal the impact of voice assistants on language behavioracross the lifespan. The Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Well-Being of the Asian Pacific Islander American (APIA) Population Ages 18-30 Residing in Yolo and Sacramento, California Zoua Vang Sponsor: Christian Bohringer, M.D. MED: Anesth & Pain Medicine Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, is an infectiouscommunicable respiratory illness that has affected over 100,000people throughout Sacramento and Yolo County. During thepandemic, social distancing and lockdown measures were putin place to ensure the safety of our communities. Mental healthissues have become relatively common in the youth group dueto social isolation. Our aim is to investigate, to what degree hasCOVID-19 impacted the mental well-being of the Asian & PacificIslander American (APIA) community, ages 18-30, residing in theYolo County and Sacramento City/County, CA region comparedto the Caucasian population? Our online survey asksparticipants to rate statements based on their mental health,healthcare access, and academic performances. Our survey wasopened from January 20th, 2021 to February 3rd, 2021. Oursample group (n=147) consisted of 32 participants identifying asCaucasian and 94 participants identifying as Asian/PacifierIslander. Our data suggest that Caucasian and APIAcommunities are experiencing depressive symptoms. However,the APIA community reported having a higher impact ofnegative effects related to depression, anxiety, mood, andstress levels. In conclusion, there should be more resources tosupport the APIA community regarding their mental well-being,especially during this time. Neo-Imperialism and the Cold War Legacy of the 21st Century: Analyzing the Triangular Relationship Between the United States, the Philippines, and China Mikka Vapor Sponsor: Ga young Chung, Ph.D. Asian American This research examines the long-standing \"special\" relationshipbetween the Philippines and the U.S. as it has developed andevolved from its colonial and imperial relations of the past.Despite the Philippines' granted sovereignty, the U.S. still hasclose political, economic, and military ties with the Philippines,maintaining its large influence over the Philippines in its globaleconomic and military presence. Focusing on the variousinternational agreements including the Visiting ForcesAgreement, the 2014 Enhanced Defense CooperationAgreement, and other international policy proposals, I argue thatthe neo-imperialistic relationship of the U.S. and the Philippineshas been maintained through their current internationalrelations. I also address that the U.S. has attempted to draw thePhilippines closer in their superpower rivalry with China,reflecting an ongoing Cold War legacy in the Asia-Pacific. Byusing a mixed methodology approach that includes Fairclough's(1992) Critical Discourse Analysis, Cultural Political EconomyAnalysis, and Foreign Policy Analysis, I demonstrate that thelanguage of these international agreements and policies revealsthe U.S.' perspective and view of their role in the Philippines, theU.S.-China rivalry and their discussed actions towards thesecountries. Bioprinting Transgenic Rice Cells for Production of a Agent, Butyrylcholinesterase Anika Varma Sponsor: Karen Mcdonald, Ph.D. Chemical Bioprinting of plant cells provides a novel platform forproduction of biotherapeutics like butyrylcholinesterase, ahuman blood protein that can bind to and inactivateorganophosphate nerve agents. In the McDonald-Nandi Lab, wegrow transgenic rice cells that produce recombinant ricebutyrylcholinesterase (rrBChE) in suspension culture upon sugarstarvation. In this research, we develop a specialized bioreactorsystem that retains cells in a solid hydrogel matrix, which mayoffer benefits like reduced cell aggregation, controlled nutrientmass transfer, easy medium exchange, and improved productrecovery. Immobilized cells and cells in suspension aremaintained for 14 days through one growth-expression cycle.Viability is assessed by an absorbance-based triphenyltetrazolium chloride sugar YSI analyzer. Active rrBChE concentration ismeasured using a Modified Ellman Assay, and total solubleprotein is calculated from a Bradford Assay, to determinesecreted protein in media and intracellular protein in crude cellextract. Protein profiles and rrBChE are further visualized withSDS-PAGE and Western Blot. Our results are promising,showing comparable viability and productivity between cellsretained in hydrogel and control cultures grown in liquidsuspension. This incentivizes further experimentation and scale-up of bioprinting technology for continuous manufacture ofbiotherapeutics.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 120Development of a Rotational Testbed for CubeSat Imaging Slew Requirements Vartak Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr This presentation discusses the research and development of a motorized rotation testbed to define reaction wheel slewrequirements in support of UC Davis' REALOP CubeSat mission.One critical goal of the REALOP mission is to capture clearimages of the Earth from low Earth orbit (LEO), requiring finelytuned attitude control from the on-board reaction wheels to limitmotion blur. This performance requirement was investigatedusing a microstepping motor to simulate a one degree-of-freedom rotational environment for testing the image quality ofa Raspberry Pi V2 Camera Module. Through varying thecamera's angular velocity, exposure, and ISO, images werecaptured and then qualitatively analyzed to determine therotation threshold that the satellite's reaction wheels mustmaintain to return clear pictures from LEO. Experimental resultsfound a maximum rotation rate of 20\u00b0/s and an exposure time of100 /uni03BCs at ISO 200 suitable for successful imaging efforts. While the motor step resolution constrained the rotational smoothnessof the testbed, this design demonstrates a low-budget optionfor student teams investigating CubeSat imaging attitude controlrequirements. The use of an environment more similar to that ofLEO, such as a frictionless air-bearing table, is recommended tobetter simulate unconstrained rotation. Factors Influencing the Appeal of Ethno-racially Diverse Schools Preetha Vellayapan Sponsor: Jacob Hibel, Ph.D. Sociology While it is well known that race is a major determinant of schoolchoice, it is not known to what degree student racialcomposition matters when compared to other school factors.Because the tendency of parents to choose schools withpopulations that are ethno-racially similar to them results in defacto school segregation, it is important to understand if certainschool characteristics can mitigate these patterns. In order tounderstand how race and non-racial school characteristicsinteract to impact school choice preferences ofCalifornia parents, a factorial survey will be administered. Schoolcharacteristics such as racial composition, academicperformance, class size, and the existence of magnet programswill be independently varied and presented to participants asvignettes to evaluate. Results will illustrate whether certainschool characteristics motivate parents to choose schools withpopulations that are ethno-racially different from them. If thereare school characteristics that significantly impact parentpreferences despite racial dissimilarities, these findings caninform school policies to encourage California parents tochoose more ethno-racially diverse schools.Admixture Analysis of Hispanic Populations in TCGA Database for Gastric Mutations Rasika Venkatesh Sponsor: Luis Ph.D. MED: Biochem & Molecular cancer (GC) is the third cause of cancer-related deathsworldwide and limited research has been done regarding itsetiology and genetics in non-European populations.Understanding the genetic etiology of GC is important inalleviating health disparities among minority populations,particularly in Hispanic patients who are twice as likely to diefrom GC. Towards this end, this study aims to identify novelgermline variants associated with GC and determine theprominence of certain mutations in various populations throughglobal and local genetic ancestral analyses. Utilizing localancestry analysis in examining the genetics of complex traitshas the potential to increase our ability to detect geneticassociations in understudied admixed genetic ancestralpopulations. We will use admixture analysis, which looks atregions or variants and ancestry within the GC patientpopulation against a reference control population of individualswith non-gastrointestinal cancers, to identify novel variantsassociated with GC in EUR, AFR, and AMR genetic ancestralgroups. This analysis will provide etiological information thatfurthers our understanding of GC in Hispanic populations, whichmay aid in the identification of individuals at high risk for GC andthe development of additional treatments. Thyroid Hormone-induced Lower Jaw Remodeling in Xenopus tadpoles: Effects of Retinoid-X Receptor Ligands and Roles of Vetter Sponsor: John Furlow, Ph.D. Neuro Physio & Behavior Thyroid hormone (TH) signaling plays critical roles duringvertebrate development, including regulation of skeletal andcartilage growth. Thyroid Hormone receptors (TRs)heterodimerize with Retinoid-X receptors (RXRs) to regulategene expression, but RXR ligands do not appear to affect THsignaling in adults. Amphibian metamorphosis, especially inXenopus laevis, the African clawed frog, is a well-established invivo model for studying the mechanisms of TH action duringdevelopment. We have shown that RXR ligands potentiate THcompetence in certain tissues using a precociousmetamorphosis assay. In this study, we focus on the jaw thatundergoes dramatic TH-mediated remodeling duringmetamorphosis to support new feeding and breathing styles.Using a battery of approaches including quantitativemorphology, differential gene expression and whole mount cellproliferation assays, we show that both pharmacologic(bexarotene) and environmental TH-induced RXR antagonist UVI-3003 inhibits TH action.Our results particularly in jaw remodeling and RXR ligand potentiation. Wealso present preliminary data using TALEN induced TR\u00df mutanttadpoles to distinguish the roles of the two TR isoforms (a and\u00df) in TH action and RXR ligand effects in the lower jaw. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 121The Ethics of Animal Research and the Use of The Problem of Marginal Cases Victoria Vicu a Sponsor: Christina Rulli, Ph.D. Philosophy The use of non-human animals in biomedical research has long been a contentious topic amongst scientists, philosophers, andanimal rights' activists. With 25 million vertebrate animals usedfor research each year, the question regarding animals'possession of a moral status has been an ethical dilemma.Amongst the various arguments regarding the issue of animals'moral rights, the Problem of Marginal Cases (PoMC) has beenused by many animal advocates. The PoMC is an argumentused to compare the moral status of certain persons such asinfants, the severely mentally handicapped, and the comatose,to non-human animals. The PoMC explains that if such persons,unfortunately referred to as \"marginal\", are given moralconsideration, despite their inability to meet the usual criteria ofa moral status, then non-human animals should also be givensuch consideration. This paper investigates the use of the PoMCand its validity in the ethical discussion of animal research.Whatever conclusion is decided on may lead to theconsideration of changes in the ethical treatment of non-humananimals. Moreover, such changes could lead to drasticadjustments in the use of animals in research, if not thecomplete elimination. Building an App to Promote a Sense of Belonging for UCD Students Abigail Vigil Sponsor: Kali Trzesniewski, Ph.D. Anr Human Ecology The purpose of this study is to provide representation for thestruggles that students may face in their transition to college. Toattempt to help represent all backgrounds and commonstruggles, we have created \"belonging stories\" of how previousstudents have dealt with these experiences. The BelongingTeam is working towards developing a mobile app for all UCDavis students to read these stories and feel more connectedand supported. With help from our design team on the app,we've created a Prototype that has allowed us to gain feedbackfrom current UC Davis students through focus groups andonline surveys, due to the recent change to online format. Wesought out to see how beneficial the app is, how user-friendlythe app is, and what additional resources we may be able toadd. As we gather more information on accessibility, aesthetic,and impact of the stories, we are editing the app and gatheringresearch so that this app can be as effective as possible. Ourgoal is create an app that allows students to feel like theybelong to UC Davis, and offer it in an easily-digestible way withappropriate resources that accompany it.The Use of Lived Experiences in Addressing Incarceration and Recidivism Brittany Villalpando Sponsor: Monica Torreiro-Casal, Ph.D. Chicano Studies the topic of incarceration and recidivism has longplagued marginalized communities for generations. A multitudeof attempts at reform has brought both success and failure.There has been a disconnect between activists andpolicymakers on how to address this crisis. Currently, there hasbeen documented evidence and research on alreadyestablished alternative routes to addressing the issue at hand,however, a new approach has been producing promisingresults. The work conducted by one Sacramento basedorganization called Self Awareness and Recovery utilizes theiroriginal Self Awareness and Recovery Model as a tool to bringeffective change within their community. The use of livedexperiences and trauma-informed care from Self Awareness andRecovery have laid a path in the right direction to improve thelives of \"at-risk youth\" and formerly incarcerated individualswithin Sacramento County. This study aims to unveil the livedexperiences of formerly incarcerated youth and adults bycollecting personal testimony through one-on-one interviews.The findings from this research will contribute to connectingactivists and policymakers, to create an effective reform toincarceration and recidivism. The Effect of Warm Interactions between Siblings on Educational Attainment Elsie Villanueva Sponsor: Jonah Cox, Ph.D. Human Ecology This study seeks to assess how parental hostility affectseducational outcomes, also looking at the impact of siblingwarmth. We draw our data from the Iowa Youth and FamilyProject, a longitudinal study began in 1989 when the targetchildren were in 7th grade and continuing through youngadulthood. Recorded family interactions were coded for dyadichostility and warmth between each of the family members. Forthe purposes of our analyses, we looked at educationaloutcomes by assessing how many years of education the targetchildren achieved by the age of 25, controlling for 7th gradeGPA, family per-capita income levels, and parental educationlevels. The overall model was significant. Observed maternalhostility held a significant and negative effect on educationlevels, while father's observed hostility was not significant.Sibling warmth approached significance, with a positive effecton education outcomes. From these preliminary findings, itdoes appear that educational attainment is not only dependenton one's academic experiences but also may be affected by therelationship between parent and child as well as betweensiblings. Further analysis will help determine if maintaining apositive relationship with one's siblings may serve as a bufferagainst lack of emotional support from parents.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 122Returns to Agricultural Technology in Rich and Poor Countries Alexis Vivas Flores Sponsor: Ashish Shenoy, Ph.D. Ag & Resource Economics The implementation of agricultural technology techniques is the \"perfect\" solution to improve the potential and efficiency ofcrops in countries around the globe that have different landquality. There may be some natural production differences incrops, but these differences may be intensified because of moredirect research in some crops than others. In this project, we willexplore the land quality and crop choice in both rich and poorcountries where we will test the hypothesis that the returns totechnology are greater for crops that grow in rich countries.Assuming this hypothesis is correct, we will then quantify howmuch directed research contributes to the agriculturalproductivity gap between rich and poor countries by computingthe difference between maximum potential yield for high-and-low investment. Our quantitative methods include running linearregressions using data from our main sources FAO GAEZdatabase, and data on national wealth from the Penn WorldTables. Our research will contribute to the field by reinforcingthe idea that research is an essential tool in a given countrybefore implementing agricultural technology. The Role of AXL Tyrosine suggests AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)has been associated with a number of human cancers, includingmelanoma, but its role in evasion of immune surveillance andresponse to immunotherapy has not been well defined.Therefore, we aim to examine the mechanisms by which AXLRTK mediates resistance to modern therapies in melanoma.Clinical data for metastatic melanoma patients weredownloaded from archive. Biomarkers weredefined as \"high\" or \"low\" expressions in each patient. In vitroassays were conducted to examine the effect of AXL inhibitionon melanoma tumor cell expression and function. The resultsshow that stage IV patients responding to Pembrolizumabdemonstrated significantly lower AXL levels compared tononresponders. However, in the overweight population, highAXL expression was associated with improved survival. Thedata suggest that AXL activity is associated with melanoma cellbehavior and immunologic response in melanoma patients. AXLappears to mediate response in the obese population by amacrophage driven mechanism as opposed to T cell mediation.Further definition of the potential therapeutic impact of AXLdirected targeting in melanoma is warranted.Effect of Starch Branching Enzyme Gene Variants on Starch Digestibility and Quality Metrics L.)

Tomato is apopular global commodity in the world. Surprisingly, tomato fruitat the Mature Green stage contains a substantial amount ofstarch up to 40% of fruit dry weight which is then degraded tosugars during fruit ripening. It is known that Starch BranchingEnzymes (SBEs) are a determinant of starch crystallinity, whichregulates starch digestibility to sugars. However, it is not knownhow variation in starch digestibility would influence sugarcontent and the physiological and metabolic pathways thatdepend on sugars. Our goal therefore is to create tomato fruitvarying incrementally in starch digestibility, by reducing theexpression of two SBE genes using CRISPR/Cas9. We expectthat because starch breakdown contributes to fruit sugars, fruitsweetness and the sugars needed for growth maintenancewould be affected, ultimately influencing fruit quality and shelf-life, factors that determine postharvest waste and loss.

ET is the use of emotionlanguage (e.g. emotion words, emotion questions) and plays acrucial role in socializing emotion understanding and behaviors.ER encompasses all processes in monitoring, understanding,and modifying one's reactions to the outside environment in aneffort to accomplish one's goals. However, there is lessresearch with families of diverse cultural backgrounds. Toaddress the gaps in previous research, this study examinesdifferences in cultural groups and the associations between ETand children's ER with Mexican-American (MA) (N=46) andChinese-American (CA) (N=44) families from Head Start. Parentswere asked to read a picture book, \"Frog, Where Are You?\" totheir child. Children's ER was assessed by the Transparent Boxtask, a frustration eliciting task. Preliminary results showsignificant differences in ET between MA and CA parents withMA parents showing more ET than CA parents. Preliminaryfindings also show associations between parents' negativewords and child's persistence during the Transparent Boxactivity. These results suggest possible cultural differences.Implications will be discussed. Pollen Tube Growth in Medicago sativa (alfalfa) in Response to Compatible and Non-compatible Rhizobia Parker Wheeler Sponsor: Alison Berry, Ph.D. Plant Sciences Nodulating plants participate in a symbiotic relationship with soilbacteria that fix nitrogen, an essential nutrient for plant growth.Host-specific bacteria initiate nodulation by modifying growth ofroot hair cells, using an exchange of signals. By characterizingthe relationship between root hair growth and bacterium, wemay better understand how to encourage nodulation andpromote plant growth, reducing the need for nitrogen fertilizers.To mimic this response, pollen tubes were used as a model forroot hairs, since both pollen tubes and root hairs exhibit tip-based growth, and pollen tubes are single cells, making themeasier to manipulate. Germinating Medicago sativa (alfalfa)pollen nitrogen fixing non-compatible with sativa). We found that pollengrains inoculated with S. meliloti produced pollen tubes at a rateof 66% \u00b115, while pollen inoculated with R. etli at a rate of 40% \u00b113, and uninoculated produced tubes ata rate of 17% \u00b117. This suggests that 1) both bacteria stimulatedpollen tube growth, and 2) signaling by the symbioticallycompatible strain may induce an increased growth response.Bioinformatics Analysis of Novel Genes Associated With Tomato Fruit Postharvest Quality Parker Wheeler Sponsor: Diane Beckles, Ph.D. Plant Sciences Tomatoes are universally popular, high in fiber and antioxidants,and are revered for the 'authenticity' they add to many culturaldishes. However, consumers have expressed unhappiness withthe quality of store-bought tomatoes, because trades-offs madewith respect to enhancing shelf-life and optimizing quality. Toprolong shelf-life, tomatoes may be harvested before they reachfull ripe and stored for variable periods before consumption,conditions that destroy fruit quality compared to fruit harvestedwhen ripe. The genes that are affected by different postharveststorage conditions have not been fully characterized, but abetter understanding of their mode of action may help toimprove tomato quality. Transcriptomics and methylomics wereused to identify genes whose expression changed in concertwith changes in tomato fruit quality due to different postharvesthandling. Several differentially expressed genes were identified,many of which have not been previously implicated in tomatofruit quality. In this work, we initiated a bioinformatic analysis ofthese genes and their cognate gene families, in tomato andother species, to determine if they are universally involved infruit quality or ripening. This is the first step towards theirfunctional analysis in fruit, using reverse genetics approaches,and long-term improvement in commercial fruit quality. Better Together: Identifying Human CTP Synthetase Partners Involved in Intracellular Transport and Regulation Jan Wignall Sponsor: Enoch Baldwin, Ph.D. Molecular & Cellular Bio CTP synthetases (CTPSs) are that biosynthesis. Defects inhuman CTPSs can cause immunodeficiencies while selectivelycontrolling their activity could be used to treat autoimmune disease. CTPSs have an elaborate regulatory network, with amore unusual aspect being reversible formation of micron scalepolymeric filaments. These filaments alter enzyme kinetics andare vital for regulating CTP production. Fluorescently-taggedhCTPSs expressed in MCF10A human breast cells form twodistinct structures that are dynamically transported throughoutthe cytoplasm: small puncta and large rods. The large rodscolocalize with other polymeric filaments, such as IMPDH2, apurine biosynthetic enzyme, but a complete list of partners isunknown. We hypothesize that hCTPSs directly interact withproteins involved in their transport and regulation, or withproteins under the same metabolic control. To identifyinteracting proteins, we will perform immunoprecipitationfollowed by mass spectrometry, testing variables such ascrosslinking and growth conditions. Direct observation of RFP-tagged candidates colocalizing with hCTPS1-CFP or hCTPS2-YFP in MCF10A cells will provide further evidence for theirinteraction, with IMPDH2-RFP as a positive control. DeterminingCTPS interactors will reveal dynamic localization purpose andmechanisms, and unmask novel regulatory networks controllingpyrimidine biosynthesis.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 124Effects of Extraction Parameters on Extractability and Functional Properties of Lentil Proteins Jennifer Wijaya Sponsor: Juliana Leite NobregaDeMouraBell, Ph.D. Food Science & Technology The need for alternative protein sources, especially plant proteins, has increased in popularity in the food industry inrecent years due to its high nutritional value and its role insupporting sustainability. Legumes, particularly lentils, arewidely known as prominent sources of proteins. Lentil proteinsare a source of essential amino acids and possess a wide rangeof functional properties that open up their potential use inseveral food product applications. Various extraction conditionshave been used to extract lentil proteins. However, the effectsof key extraction parameters on the extractability and structuralmodifications of lentil proteins, the latter having a key impact onthe technological and functional properties of the extractedprotein, remain unclear. This review highlights the effects ofdifferent extraction methods on the extractability of lentilproteins and focuses on how the extraction parameters could aswell affect the functional and the biological properties of lentilproteins. Does the Nature of Rotation Matter? Assessing Infants' Mental Rotation in an Online Task. Amanda Wilheim Sponsor: Lisa Oakes, Ph.D. Psychology Mental rotation, which is the ability to mentally manipulate andmake predictions about an object's orientation, is critical forunderstanding objects in our daily lives. Previous studies haverevealed sex differences during infancy, specifically that boysshow greater mental rotation than girls (Moore & Johnson,2008; Quinn & Liben, 2008, Lauer et al., 2015). The goal of thecurrent study was to assess how the nature of the rotationinfluences infants' mental rotation. We tested infants using anonline platform called Lookit (Lookit.mit.edu) that allows familiesto participate in studies from home. One-hundred-fifty infantsbetween the ages of 6 and 13 months were tested in a modifiedversion of the task used by Lauer et al. In that task, infants wereshown two stimulus streams containing identical tetris-shapeditems that repeatedly appear and disappear. On every thirdpresentation one stream contained the mirror image of the itemin the other stream. We manipulated the nature of rotation bypresenting some trials in which the items rotated sequentially(i.e., continuously and clockwise); the remaining trials were non-sequential and random. Ongoing analyses will allow us toevaluate previously observed patterns in mental rotation tasks,including age and sex-related differences. Validating the Use of an Electrified Gate for Measuring Motivation for a Food Reward in Feedlot Cattle Kayla Wilkerson Sponsor: Cassandra Tucker, Ph.D. Animal Science The primary objective of this study is to validate the use of anelectrified gate for measuring motivation for a food reward. Sixcohorts of 4 steers will be fed a transition diet (18% forage) andone of 3 treatment diets (n=8/treatment) in automated feed binsthat measure intake: 1) an empty bin, 2) an additional offering ofprimary diet, or 3) a corn and molasses food reward. Theprimary diet bin will have an unelectrified wooden gate and thetreatment bin will have an electrified wooden gate. The currenton the electrified gate will be increased exponentially (startingat 0 /uni03BC.1A and reaching a maximum of 5000 /uni03BC.1A) every two days so long as the animal successfully accesses the bin in theprevious 48 hours. We expect cattle provided with a foodreward will show less latency, access the food reward morefrequently, and tolerate higher maximum currents compared tothe cattle provided with an additional offering of their primarydiet or an empty bin behind the electrified gate, suggestingmotivation to access the food reward. Yield Effects of Drought Tolerant Maize in Sub-Saharan Africa Miranda Willard Sponsor: Stephen Boucher, Ph.D. Ag & Resource Economics Maize is a vital crop for both income and food security in Sub-Saharan African countries, such as Mozambique and Tanzania.Drought tolerant (DT) maize varieties have been developed andproclaimed to be an important technology that will offerprotection for small farmers. On-Farm trials by The InternationalMaize and Wheat Improvement Center have shown a 10% yieldadvantage for DT maize varieties over comparison maizevarieties, with that advantage growing to 12% under droughtconditions. However, it is still unknown whether a yieldadvantage when using DT maize exists for small farmers inpractice, and under what types of weather conditions thatadvantage exists. I analyze data from small farmers inMozambique and Tanzania to determine whether a yieldadvantage can be found when treatment groups in thesecountries are offered DT maize. Using both a difference-in-difference and ANCOVA regression technique, I estimate theimpacts of DT maize on yields in different combinations ofweather conditions concerning mid-season and early-seasondrought. I find under both difference-in-difference and ANCOVAregression techniques, there is a substantial yield advantage fortreatment groups offered DT maize over control groups duringmid-season drought and this advantage holds independently ofthe quality of early season rainfall.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 125Access to Highly Effective Reversible Contraception at Family Planning Clinics in California Elena Willow Sponsor: Eleanor Schwarz, M.D. MED: Int Med - Genl Medicine Subdermal and intrauterine contraceptives are safer and more effective than birth control pills. California's Family Planning,Access, Care, and Treatment (FPACT) program offers freecontraceptive services to individuals living at or below 200% ofthe federal poverty level. To assess the proportion of FPACTclinics currently providing intrauterine and/or subdermalcontraceptives, we performed a \"secret shopper\" study of a20% random sample, stratified by county. Of the 2,200 clinicslisted on the FPACT website, located in 53 counties, we aimedto contact 325, and successfully collected data from 183. Most(61%) clinics reported offering both subdermal and intrauterinecontraceptives, 9% only intrauterine contraceptives(IUC), implants; 18% did not offereither, and 10% had staff that were uncertain of thecontraceptives offered. Among clinics offering IUC, 3% onlyoffered 61% offered IUC but were unsure of the type.These findings indicate that a considerable number of familyplanning clinics in California are not currently providing thesafest and most effective contraceptives. Further training ofclinic staff is needed to ensure that all Californian families haveaccess to the full range of contraceptive methods. Investigating the Energy Consumption of Cell-Free Protein Synthesis Systems Using an ATP/ADP Biosensor Matthew Wong Sponsor: Cheemeng Tan, Ph.D. Biomedical Engineering Unlike the traditional way of producing proteins using livingcells, cell-free protein synthesis systems represent a novel wayto synthesize proteins in vitro. Cell-free systems are constructedfrom the bottom-up using biological machinery critical to proteinsynthesis. They also have many advantages over in vivo proteinproduction, including rapid protein expression, directmanipulation of the reaction conditions and their ability tosynthesize toxic proteins. Since cellular energies are essentialcomponents in protein synthesis, understanding and controllingthe energy consumption are essential for enhancing cell-freesystems. Here, we purify Perceval, an ATP/ADP ratio biosensor,to investigate the energy consumption of cell-free systems. Wecharacterize Perceval's response to different concentrations ofonly ATP or ADP, and different ATP/ADP ratios. We alsoinvestigate how the presence of different rNTPs at differentconcentrations affects the specificity of Perceval's response.Finally, we discuss how this biosensor can be applied to cell-free systems to investigate their energy consumption. Our workhas broad impact on understanding and controlling theenergetics of cell-free protein synthesis systems.Part Preparation and Cable Routing within a CubeSat Jordan Wong Sponsor: Stephen Robinson, Ph.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engr REALOP is the first UC Davis undergraduate-based CubeSatteam with a launch scheduled for late 2021. Under missionREALOP, the Structures team has developed a cable harnessingmodel and prepared a process for manufacturing. Morespecifically, the parts preparation subteam is responsible formanufacturing preparation as well as creating validation andverification documents. The cable harnessing subteam isresponsible for acquiring cable lengths and organization for usein electrical wiring. For parts preparation, drawings of everycomponent as well as tolerances were made for use inmanufacturing. Then Interface and Control Documents (ICDs)were developed to detail how each component interfaces withone another during assembly. Mechanical Part InspectionDocuments (MPINs) were also created to verify if themanufacturers made the components correctly. For the cableharnessing subteam, Solidworks was used to provide areasonable representation of the wiring in the CubeSat in orderto obtain wire lengths. Drawings of the wire lengths were thengenerated for use by the electrical team. Both teams in tandemprovide a basic schematic of how the CubeSat is assembled,but more importantly also expose members to thedocumentation and practices that go into spacecraftdevelopment, increasing the efficiency of developing futureCubeSats. Talking to Babies: Does What You Say Matter? Wai Yan Emma Wong Sponsor: Katharine Graf Estes, Ph.D. Psychology It seems instinctive for adults to use infant-directed speech (IDS)when speaking to infants\u2014they raise their pitch, slow theirspeech, and exaggerate their intonation. Acoustic features haveshown significant impacts on infant word-learning (Ma et al.,2011), but elaboration may also play a role. While a study hasshown that repeating words facilitates word-learning (Maura etal., 2020), elaboration could also be important for languageacquisition by exposing infants to the context of words. Thisstudy will examine the difference between repetition andelaboration of IDS and its relationship to infants' vocabularydevelopment. Twenty American-English speaking parent-childdyads participated in a set of interactive tasks that containedobjects labelled with target words. Audio recordings will beanalyzed for the frequencies of target words spoken (e.g. cow)and additional descriptors used per object (e.g. \"cows makemilk\"). We also collected parental reports of infant vocabularysize. We predict that infants whose parents use additionaldescriptors will have larger vocabularies than infants whoseparents use more isolated repetitions of target words. Wepropose that elaborations are important because it diversifiesword exposure. Understanding the role of repetition andelaboration in IDS is important because they may facilitate infantlanguage acquisition.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 126A Physiological Study of Seedlings' Growth Response on High NUE Wheat Under Nitrogen Stress Cheng Lam Wong Sponsor: Diane Beckles, Ph.D. Plant Sciences The use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in agriculture is fiscally expensive and, creates many environmental problems. Wheat isa staple food that requires a high N-application for maximumproductivity. Thus, increasing wheat N-use efficiency (NUE) isessential to minimizing the amount of N used. Previous studieshave found a quantitative trait locus (QTL) in wild wheat thatcould be related to higher NUE but, the physiological basis andgrowth response under N stress is still unknown. We will use asemi-hydroponic system to study and characterize thephysiology and growth of different wheat genotypes under asufficient and low N environment. The physiological parameters(e.g., root and shoot length, biomass, etc.) of introgression line,99 (IL-99), which contains the additive QTL for high NUE, will bemeasured and compared to the low NUE parent (RUTA). Weexpect to see poorer growth parameters under a low Nenvironment, but that IL- 99 should show better growth under Nstress. This study will provide the information for the growthresponse of line 99 seedlings under low N stress. Utilizing Treatment Data to Categorize Platinum-Based Chemotherapy Resistance Sydney Woods Sponsor: Jeremy Chien, Ph.D. MED: Biochem & Molecular Med Standard ovarian cancer treatment involves surgical resection oftumors followed by a primary adjuvant treatment which utilizes acombination of platinum-based and taxane chemotherapeutics. Researchers have found that many patients develop resistanceto platinum-based drugs, making optimization of treatmentplans extremely difficult to accomplish. To advance a betterunderstanding of chemotherapy resistance in patients, it isimportant to accurately categorize patients with differentialresponse to treatment. We will curate existing ovarian cancerpatient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databaseto categorize patients into three groups: platinum-refractorypatients, who experience progression during treatment;platinum-resistant patients, who experience progression withinsix months of ending treatment; and platinum-sensitive patients,who do not experience progression for at least six months afterending treatment. Relevant patient data such as drug namesand dates of progression events and treatments will bedownloaded, standardized, corrected for typographical errors,and then utilized to categorize each patient according to theirresponse type. The data will then be filtered for those whohave received a standard treatment to serve as comparisongroups upon which to perform a comparative genomic analysisfor identification of any genetic factors and biological pathwaysthat are associated with differential patient response tochemotherapy.Effects of Ditching on Soil Structure and Vegetation Community in refugia for native species during the summer dryseason in California. This study focused on the impacts ofmanmade drainage ditches on soil structure and wetland-dependent vegetation in alpine fens. Surveys were conductedin fall of 2020 in the Childs Meadow complex, which is anongoing meadow restoration site in the Lassen National Forestin California. Sample plots were located above (upslope) andbelow drainage ditches in two fen locations within the complex.Soil cores were collected in each plot and analyzed for mineraland organic content, texture, color, and depth to groundwater.Percent cover of representative wetland-dependent species,such as Sphagnum spp. moss, was estimated in each 40 by 40 cm plot. Above-ditch plots had considerably wetter soils withhigher organic matter content, as well as greater percent coverof Sphagnum moss. In both fen locations, areas below theditches had reduced organic soil components, increased grasscover, and greater depth to groundwater. This study provides abaseline of soil and vegetation conditions in two impacted fensin Childs Meadow. Continued annual monitoring of the studyplots will provide valuable data on the impacts of restorationactions planned for 2022. Innate Immune Responses in Sustentacular Cells and Olfactory Sensory Neurons Against Viral Pathogens Garrett Wu Sponsor: Qizhi Gong, Ph.D. MED: Cell Biology & Human Anat The nasal mucosa is exposed to the environment andpathogens. the nasal mucosa and inside the olfactoryepithelium (OE), pathogens may use olfactory sensory neurons(OSNs) as a direct route to the brain, causing neurodegenerativediseases. Despite this susceptibility, the mechanisms of viraldefense from different cell types within the OE have not beenextensively studied. Viruses are pathogens that hijack host machinery to replicate. Within the olfactory epithelium, there are two major cell typesthat act as the initial barrier, sustentacular (Sus) cells and OSNs.Based on evidence from literature and studies from our lab, it ishypothesized that Sus cells have abilities for innate immunityand preventive function to protect OSNs. Being a neurotropicvirus, our model virus vesicular somatic virus (VSV) is capable ofinfecting OSNs and Sus cells. However, it is unknown if VSVreplication is controlled in these cell types. This study tests thehypothesis by examining temporal innate immune responses inSus cells after VSV infection and comparing VSV replicationrates with dsRNA levels, in Sus and OSNs. This research aims to identify cellular and molecular players critical for controlling viral replication and spread so that we candevelop strategies against viral infection.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 127From Chaos to Success: Comparing the influence of Mixed Practice to that of Categorized Sets of Questions Arista Wu Sponsor: Ozcan Gulacar, Ph.D. Chemistry Questions in assignments for students are often grouped by chapter, topic, or concepts. The structure shows a greatemphasis on categorization. Practice problems in chemistrytextbooks are mostly organized by sections to help studentsnavigate the assignments and practice in order; however,exams usually test students with problems from a series ofchapters in a mixed format. Therefore, there is a mismatchbetween what students practice on and how they are tested.The goal of this study is to examine the structure of theassignments on students' problem-solving performances. Thestudy uses scientific control method and divides students intotwo groups throughout three experiment sessions. Each grouphad interventions with same length and identical questions butdifferent structures. The experimental group had mixedquestions, while the control group had questions organizedbased on chapters and topics. This study is critical in studyingstudents' learning abilities with mixed and categorizedproblems. The findings could help UC Davis instructors to betterstructure their teaching materials to help improve students'problem-solving abilities. Given most textbooks and instructorstend to organize and classify content for students to navigatethe knowledge base, this study is important to assess theeffectiveness of the traditional teaching method. Deep Learning for Pre-Operative Tumor Segmentation Kajetan Wysoczynski Sponsor: Jinyi Qi, Ph.D. Computed tomography used for diagnosingcancer. Radiologists perform routine work delineating tumors,which is prone to inconsistencies. One practice is imagesegmentation - outlining an area of interest on a scan, such as atumor. Artificial intelligence in surgical oncology augments theperformance of surgeons and radiologists, assisting in properdiagnosis and improving surgical outcomes. We implemented aconvolutional neural network (CNN) with U-Net structure usingTensorflow and Keras packages. The model delivers promisingperformance resulting from multi-channel feature maps and fivedistinct levels. Given a preoperative CT scan, CNNs canautonomously trace the outline of a malignant tumor in the formof a mask image, which shows medical professionals a visual ofcancerous tissue. The CNN is trained from a dataset comprising96 head and neck tumor patients, appended by surgicaloutcomes and confirmed cancer status to reduce error. This AI-based approach provides custom, patient-specific guidance forthe shape and size of the tumor, which can reduce human erroroccurring during the preoperative diagnosis stage. Thetechnology has great potential to assist surgeons in making theright incisions, as well as reduce the incidence of radiologicmistakes during diagnosis.Exploring the Function of Putative Type VI Secretion E. coli Elva Xian Sponsor: Tiffany Ph.D. Plant Pathology The System (T6SS) is an important structurethat mediates interbacterial competition in gram-negativebacteria. The molecular syringe-like apparatus uses acontracting mechanism that allows the bacteria to shoot toxicproteins called effectors across its cellular envelope into otherbacteria. For each effector, there is a corresponding immunityprotein that protects the bacteria from the effector. This allowsthe bacteria to kill foreign bacteria without hurting themselves.Previous random barcoded transposon site sequencing (RB-TnSeq) data showed that immunity genes were vital for thegrowth of plant pathogenic Ralstonia in planta. We explored thefunction of effectors without their respective immunity proteinsin E. coli using pBAD18 plasmids with an arabinose inducer. Weexpect to see a reduction in E. coli colonies when the effectorgene is expressed. This is consistent with previous researchshowing the toxic effect of effectors when immunity proteins arenot present. A greater understanding of the T6SS will allowresearchers to manipulate it for in planta use. What are the Roles of Pitch Variation and Word Repetition in Infant Vocabulary Development? Yuxuan Xiang Sponsor: Katharine Graf Estes, Ph.D. Psychology Infant-Directed Speech (IDS), also known as baby-talk, ischaracterized by higher pitch, longer word duration, a widerpitch range, and more word repetition in comparison to Adult-Directed Speech (ADS). Prior research suggests thatcomponents of IDS affect infants' language learning. However,we do not yet know how certain linguistic elements, such asvarying pitch and word repetition, contribute to infants'vocabulary development. The current study will investigatewhether infant vocabulary size correlates with parents' pitchrange and/or the number of target word repetitions the parentproduces. We will analyze audio recordings of monolingualEnglish-speaking parents playing with their infants (n= 24, ages:10-12 months) in a task designed to elicit 14 target words (e.g.,hat, apple, boat). We will count repetitions of each target wordand measure the pitch range for these target words for eachparticipant. We will collect infant vocabulary size via parentalreports on a standardized vocabulary form. We expect thatparents with high rates of target word repetition and wide pitchranges will have infants with the largest vocabularies. Ifconfirmed , these findings would suggest that certain characteristics of IDS can be targeted to promote betterlinguistic development in infants.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 128An Automatic GitHub Takedown Tool for Educational Purposes Zesheng Xing Sponsor: Joel Porquet, Ph.D. Engr Computer Science CS students frequently post their programming homework on GitHub repositories. Though most of the time publishing theserepositories is meant to be used as a portfolio for jobapplications, it often violates instructors' copyright or providessolutions for future students who might then plagiarize fromthem and violate the university's code of conduct. To preventprogramming homework solutions from being posted online,instructors have to invest a large amount of time to search forthese repositories and then send individual emails to studentsasking them to take their repositories down. In order tostreamline this tedious process, we designed and implementedan automatic takedown script. This script allows instructors tofind repositories containing programming homework solutions,track their status over time, and send emails to students, just bytyping a few commands in the terminal. We are hoping this toolcan help CS instructors save time while increasing the accuracyof the takedown process. The Impact of Stress on Morphine Preference and Consumption Christine Xu Sponsor: Brian Trainor, Ph.D. Psychology There are several factors to consider when analyzing the risksbehind substance abuse. One such component behind anindividual's likelihood to develop substance use disorder (SUD)is the sensitivity to stress and its influence on behavior. To testthis, we used California mice (Peromyscus californicus ) a s a model to study social stress due to the aggressive nature fromboth male and females mice. After putting male and femaleCalifornia mice through social defeat stress or a controlcondition we examined the effects of social stress on morphinepreference. We first put them through four days of the forced-choice paradigm. During this acclimation period, two identicalbottles of morphine are introduced to the mice. After that, oneof the bottles is replaced with quinine water and the mice arethen presented with a choice between morphine and quininewater. Preliminary results from 32 mice (16 males and 16females) showed that while on average stressed mice increasedmorphine consumption during the forced-choice paradigm, thisdifference was not statistically significant. Surprisingly, stresshad no significant effect on morphine preference. Further studyis needed to determine how dosages and self administrationschedules interact with stress to affect morphine preferences.Investigating the Neural Correlates that Mediate the Effect of on Memory Quality Reesha Yadav Sponsor: Charan Ranganath, Ph.D. Psychology Why do we remember some things and not others from thesame event? Research has found that over time, central details(CD) of a narrative are better retained than peripheral details(PD), though it is unclear which regions of the brain areresponsible for this memory retention. Our study attempts toinvestigate how memory for events changes over time andidentify the brain regions associated with retention. Participantsin this study watched two short-movies while undergoing anfMRI scan. One of the movies was recalled immediately and theother was recalled after a 2-day delay. Then, the audiorecordings of the recalled movies were scored for CD and PD.Using the scored recall, we calculated the correlation betweenbrain activity during movie viewing and the quality ofsubsequent retrieval. Our behavioral findings were congruentwith prior research - participants remembered fewer details aftera 2-day delay compared to the immediate delay with CD betterpreserved over the delay than PD. Interestingly, we foundhippocampal activity at the event boundaries during encodingcorrelated with memory for CD at the 2-day delay, but not theinitial recall. This data suggests that hippocampal activity isimportant for retention of the gist of events. The Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Well-Being of the Asian Pacific Islander American (APIA) Population Ages 18-30 Residing in Yolo and Sacramento, California Pahoua Yang Sponsor: Christian Bohringer, M.D. MED: Anesth & Pain Medicine Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, is an infectiouscommunicable respiratory illness that has affected over 100,000people throughout Sacramento and Yolo County. During thepandemic, social distancing and lockdown measures were putin place to ensure the safety of our communities. Mental healthissues have become relatively common in the youth group dueto social isolation. Our aim is to investigate, to what degree hasCOVID-19 impacted the mental well-being of the Asian & PacificIslander American (APIA) community, ages 18-30, residing in theYolo County and Sacramento City/County, CA region comparedto the Caucasian population? Our online survey asksparticipants to rate statements based on their mental health,healthcare access, and academic performances. Our survey wasopened from January 20th, 2021 to February 3rd, 2021. Oursample group (n=147) consisted of 32 participants identifying asCaucasian and 94 participants identifying as Asian/PacifierIslander. Our data suggest that Caucasian and APIAcommunities are experiencing depressive symptoms. However,the APIA community reported having a higher impact ofnegative effects related to depression, anxiety, mood, andstress levels. In conclusion, there should be more resources tosupport the APIA community regarding their mental well-being,especially during this time. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 129The Influence of Classroom Language Environment on Bilingual Language Proficiency: Mexican-American and Chinese-American Dual Language Yang Sponsor: Yuuko Tonkovich, Ed.D. Education Research shows that classroom language has a role in children's language development with both monolingual anddual language learners (DLLs), particularly for children from low-socio-economic homes. The limited past studies that examineclassroom language have focused on Spanish-English DLLs.However, DLLs are a heterogeneous group and more researchneeds to be done with DLLs from other language backgrounds.This study examines (a) the difference between Mexican-American (MA) and Chinese-American (CA), (b) the effect of leadteacher verbal communication on DLLs' language skills, and (c)correlation between the frequency of English language andheritage language (HL) use by lead teachers and DLLs.Classroom language environment was assessed using theLanguage Interaction Snapshot (LISn) that captures languageinteractions of a total of 12 MA and 13 CA preschoolers in HeadStart settings. Each participant was observed for 5 snapshots fora total of 25 minutes between spring and summer 2019. Eachchild's oral proficiency was assessed using the Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Oral Language. Preliminary results showthat teachers with CA DLLs spoke in HL more than teacherswith MA DLLs. CA DLLs also talked to their teachers in HL morefrequently than MA DLLs. Implications for educators will bediscussed. Language, Laterality, and Handedness in Autism Spectrum Disorder Bing Ying (Laura) Yang Sponsor: Christine Nordahl, Ph.D. MED: Psychiatry & Behav Sci Language is a lateralized function in the human brain, meaningthat it is typically localized to one hemisphere over the other. Itis also closely linked to hand preference. The majority oftypically developing (TD) individuals have leftward lateralizedlanguage and are right-handed. In autism spectrum disorder(ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition involving deficits insocial communication skills, language impairments are alsocommon. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research has foundreversals in laterality of language-related brain regions andhigher incidence of left-handedness in individuals with ASD.Due to the close linkage of handedness and language, handpreference is of interest when studying brain lateralization inASD. This project will analyze handedness and MRI data fromthe Autism Phenome Project in TD and ASD children at 2-4years and again at 9-12 years of age. Preliminary results indicatethat at the earliest time point, a greater proportion of ASDchildren (17.2%) were left-handed than TD children (8.4%).Consistency of hand preference at 9-12 years and groupdifferences will be evaluated. This project will also examine laterality of language-related brain regions in this cohort, usinghandedness as a covariate of interest. Investigating and Predicting Reactivity in the Azobenzene Forming Baeyer-Mills Reaction Noah Yardeny Sponsor: David Olson, Ph.D. Chemistry Photopharmacology is an emerging synergistic field ofchemistry and biology that harnesses the power of light torender chemicals active or inactive with high spatial andtemporal control. Photoswitches are amendable groups to apharmacophore which enable compounds\"on\" or \"off\" rapidly and reversibly. Azobenzene N-N bond forming reaction betweenaryl nitroso and aryl amino compounds known as a Baeyer-Mill'sCoupling. Three outcomes are common after a Mill's reaction:desired product is formed, starting material remains unreacted,or an undesired byproduct, azoxybenzene, forms lowering theazobenzene yield. Here, the electronic effects governingreaction outcome were explored in order to predict andattenuate substrates' ability to form desired azobenzene. Toaccomplish this, differently substituted anilines were tested fortheir efficacy as azobenzene producing substrates. Calculatedoxidation potentials for these anilines were then used as aproxy for predicting reaction outcomes. These calculations werethen performed on substituted indoles which showed lowazobenzene yields. Following our predictions, the electron-richindoles' yields immensely improved through employment oflabile protecting groups. Overall, these results demonstrate thatsubstrates can be electronically manipulated to increaseazobenzene yields and offers synthetic tools for researchersinterested in studying photoswitchable compounds. Examining the Stress Response in Biracial, Multiracial, andadvantages unique from their monoracial counterparts. Thepresent study sought to evaluate the association betweenmixed racial identity and stress response in children. Participantsincluded 172 children ages 9-11 (Mean age = 9.92 years, SD=.58) who completed the Daily Hassles Scale and provided ahair sample to be assayed for cortisol concentration. Parentsreported their child's internalizing and externalizing symptoms(HBQ-P). Children were split into five groups based on parent-reported child racial identity: biracial (n = 29), minority- monoracial (n = 20), White-monoracial (n = 94), multiracial (n = 12), and White-Hispanic (n = 17). Preliminary analyses revealedno significant differences between racial groups on reportedtotal daily hassles, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, orhair cortisol levels (ps > .05). This could be due tosocioeconomic status, group distribution, or unmeasuredmoderators. We plan to examine discrepancies between parentand child-reported racial identity, and compare our sample'sracial group distribution to Census data. Follow-up analyses mayallow us to capture the interaction between mixed racial identityand stress levels. Future research should work to understandthe psychological impact of stressors or resilience factors formultiracial\u2014as compared to monoracial\u2014children, which canhave implications for intervention. UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 130Parent-child emotion talk and its link to children's emotion regulation: A cross-cultural Past studies have shown that parents' openness in emotion talk (ET) with their child can facilitate a stronger sense of control inthe child's emotion regulation (ER). ET is the use of emotionlanguage (e.g. emotion words, emotion questions) and plays acrucial role in socializing emotion understanding and behaviors.ER encompasses all processes in monitoring, understanding,and modifying one's reactions to the outside environment in aneffort to accomplish one's goals. However, there is lessresearch with families of diverse cultural backgrounds. Toaddress the gaps in previous research, this study examinesdifferences in cultural groups and the associations between ETand children's ER with Mexican-American (MA) (N=46) andChinese-American (CA) (N=44) families from Head Start. Parentswere asked to read a picture book, \"Frog, Where Are You?\" totheir child. Children's ER was assessed by the Transparent Boxtask, a frustration eliciting task. Preliminary results showsignificant differences in ET between MA and CA parents withMA parents showing more ET than CA parents. Preliminaryfindings also show associations between parents' negativewords and child's persistence during the Transparent Boxactivity. These results suggest possible cultural differences.Implications will be discussed. Evolutionary and Sequence Analysis of Putative Genes Associated with Nitrogen Use in Wheat Nancy Yip Sponsor: Diane Beckles, Ph.D. Plant Sciences Wheat provides 20% of the calories consumed by humans andis grown on almost every continent on earth. Nitrogenousfertilizer is used to promote wheat yield and quality, but it isexpensive, and harmful to the environment, contributing togreenhouse gases and eutrophication of natural waterways.Therefore, improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), i.e., theproportion of nitrogen taken up from the soil and converted towheat biomass is important. Through QTL mapping, a region ofthe wheat genome potentially associated with NUE wasdiscovered. Some of the genes in this region may be related tonitrogen and nutrient uptake; however, they have not beencharacterized or, have not been studied in wheat. In this work,we will perform a full bioinformatics analysis of three candidategenes in this region. Evolutionary, sequence and proteinanalyses will be performed using an array of available tools.These data will build a foundation of the important informationneeded to help prioritize the genes for functional in-lab testing,to determine their potential contribution to NUE in wheat. The Role of Infant-Directed Action on Infant Attention: A Comparison of Monolingual and Bilingual Infant- Caregiver Dyads Melanie Yoon Sponsor: Katharine Graf Estes, Ph.D. Psychology Caregivers modify their actions when demonstrating objects toinfants, known as infant-directed action (IDA). This studyexplores whether infants look longer at caregivers' mobilegestures (with movement of the hand or arm) or stable gestures(without movement). I investigate if there are differences ininfant looking time for gestures with small motions compared tolarge motions and whether monolingual and bilingual caregiversdiffer in frequency of gesture change. As most IDA research hasbeen conducted in laboratory settings with manipulatedgestures, I aim to examine naturalistic IDA through observingplay sessions. 38 infant-caregiver pairs (19 monolinguals, 19bilinguals) engaged in two tasks: free play and object-labelling.Interactions were recorded and coded for showing gestures,infant eye gaze, and caregiver language. I predict that (i)showing gestures with larger movements will be more effectiveat attracting and sustaining infant attention and, (ii) bilingualdyads will use gestures specific to bilingual input - they willswitch or exaggerate gestures around a language change.Therefore, bilingual caregivers may show a higher frequency ofgesture change and high amplitude gestures compared tomonolingual caregivers, leading to longer looking times forbilingual infants. This research will aid in understanding the roleof gestures on infant learning. Identifying a non-human primate model of optic neuropathy through a spontaneous pathologic mutation in the OPA1 gene Young Sponsor: (ADOA) is a heritablecondition characterized by optic nerve degeneration in humans. ADOA leads to visual impairment through retinal ganglion cell(RGC) damage. Cell based transplantation and gene therapyhold promise for treating ADOA and other optic neuropathies,but require further development before reaching human clinicaltrials. The non-human primate (NHP) serves as a model to studynovel retinal disease therapies due to their anatomical andphysiological similarities to the human retina. We identified aheterozygous A8S mutation in the OPA1 gene in a colony ofrhesus macaques at the California National Primate ResearchCenter. The same mutation is found to be responsible forhuman ADOA. Using pedigree analysis, we identified 24primates heterozygous for this mutation and confirmed theirgenotype by whole exome sequencing. Upon ophthalmicexamination, heterozygous primatesdemonstrated a reduced negative photopic response duringelectroretinography and a decreased retinal nerve fiber layer,both characteristics of RGC malfunction and cell loss. With thegenetic and phenotypic similarities between ADOA NHPs andhumans, this non-human primate model is an invaluable tool forstudying new treatments for optic neuropathies likely to betranslatable to the human population.UC Davis 32nd Annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference 131Neuropathology in a Mouse Model of Organophosphate Intoxication Alexandria Yu Sponsor: Pamela Lein, Ph.D. VM: Molecular Bio Sciences Organophosphates (OPs) are a class of synthetic neurotoxic compounds that can cause convulsions, status epilepticus (SE),and death with acute exposure. These compounds includenerve agents, as sarin and soman, and pesticides,including catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine intocholine and acetate, thereby inhibiting the breakdown ofacetylcholine in the body. The consequences of these seizurescan be long-term neuropathology, cognitive deficits, andacquired epilepsy. Our lab is investigating the neurologicaleffects of OPs by developing a mouse model of DFPintoxication that mimics the neurological consequences seen inhuman survivors of OP poisoning. After an acute injection ofDFP, treated mice experience seizures that progress to SE for atleast 4 h. Increased neurodegeneration, reactive astrogliosis,and microgliosis were observed in the brains of DFP-inducedmice compared to the vehicle controls. Significant AChEinhibition occurred for at least 14 d in the brains of DFP-treatedmice, and for up to 3 d in the blood. With the histological andbiochemical findings of this study, mice will be used as apreclinical model to further investigate the mechanisms of DFP-induced neuropathology using genetic knockout strains. Do Barriers to Voting Have Differential Effects on Democrats and Republicans? Lauren Zaren Sponsor: Benjamin Highton, Ph.D. Political Science There has been a marked increase in restrictive voting policiesimplemented at the state level since 2008. Most existingresearch seeks to measure the effects of these policies byanalyzing specific barriers to voting. Instead, I rely on acomposite index developed by Li et al., the Cost of Voting Index(COVI). I hypothesize that states with a higher cost of voting willhave a larger partisan turnout differential than those with alower cost of voting, with Democratic partisans turning out atlower rates than Republicans. My analysis found no significantcorrelation between the partisan turnout differential and COVIscores in the 2012 election, and found a weak positivecorrelation in the 2016 election. Additionally, my analysis founda weak negative correlation between increases in COVIrankings from 2012 to 2016 and an increase in the partisanturnout differential from 2012 to 2016. The results of this studyhave implications for future electoral policy decisions.The Influence of Classroom Language Environment on Bilingual Language Proficiency: Mexican-American and Chinese-American Dual Language Learners in Head Start Sunny Zhou Sponsor: Yuuko Tonkovich, Ed.D.

Activity Budgets of Golden-Mantled Ground Squirrels in the Rocky Mountains Dylan Zuver Sponsor: Dirk Van Vuren, Ph.D. Wildlife & Fisheries Biology Activity budgets reflect how an organism allocates its time overa day. Time allocation can have fitness consequences and mightbe influenced by a variety of factors. I will quantify activitybudgets of golden-mantled ground squirrels at the RockyMountain Biological Laboratory to identify factors influencingtime allocation, including the effect of predation risk on timespent vigilant, the effect of presence of conspecifics on timespent alert, and the effect of food availability on time spentforaging. I will collect my own data in the field, recording timespent foraging, alert, vigilant, running, grooming, andinteracting, and I will also use existing data from a long-termdataset. To ensure data validity, only subjects that have beenobserved for 30 days with a minimum of 100 observations persubject will be used. To record my own observations, I willcapture and mark squirrels with ear tags for permanentidentification, and with unique dye marks on their fur for visualidentification. I will conduct one-minute scan-sampleobservations to note what activity that squirrels in-view areparticipating in at time of recording. This research is the first ofits kind for golden-mantled ground squirrels and will further ourunderstanding of squirrel behavior. "}
