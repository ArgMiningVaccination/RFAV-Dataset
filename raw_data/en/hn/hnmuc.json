Herbal medicine, vitamins, and mineral supplements have been used for years to treat many conditions, deficiencies, and boost overall health. They come in many different forms: whole herb preparations foods pills tinctures topical preparations powders syrups lozenges, and more Most herbs have gentle action and few side effects when taken appropriately. But, don't let the gentle action fool you! Many herbs and supplements have been studied extensively due to their impressive results. Naturopathic Physicians are trained in the use of these substances and can determine the best choice for your individual needs. Are these safe to take with my other medications? Like any medication, herbs and supplements can interact with other pharmaceuticals, herbs, vitamins, or minerals. Your provider will choose the appropriate treatment for you based on your needs and current medications and/or supplements. Length of treatment, dosage, and form are all important considerations when prescribing these substances. Always make sure to consult a medical professional before taking any medication(s). Will my insurance cover herbs and supplements? Currently, insurance does not cover the cost of prescribed herbal medicine, vitamin or mineral supplements. There are a few instances in which certain injections or infusions may be covered. This is dependent on insurance plan and coverage limitations. Does the FDA regulate herbs and supplements? Herbs, vitamins and minerals are not regulated in the same way that conventional prescriptions are; however, there are some regulations in place. Supplement manufacturers cannot claim to treat medical conditions. Additionally, some quality production standards are in place, but strict regulation is not. So, this means that not all supplements and herbs are of the same quality. This is where it can get tricky! It can be difficult to know which are good and which are not. Purchasing your supplement from your provider is the best way to make sure you are getting a good, proven, effective product. Additionally, your provider may prescribe specific products if they do not carry them on site. Where can I find the right herb or supplement for me? Your medical provider can provide guidance as to what supplements and herbal medicine would benefit you best. Many of the supplements prescribed (or suggested) are available on site, or can be purchased from the manufacturer directly. Most providers carry the products they prescribe most on site for the following reasons: Effectiveness, proven by previous experience/research with the herb/supplement Brand trust Good quality and manufacturing conditions Lower cost for customers Customer convenience "}
