This study investigated the impact of a patient education intervention on the pneumococcal vaccination rate in elders. Methods: Charts of all patients aged 65 years or older who visited a universitY ambulatory care clinic during a 3-month period were reviewed for pneumococcal vaccination status before the patients' arrival for an office visit. Those who did not have the vaccination were provided patient education in the waiting room. Data were collected on age, sex, race, and immunization status. The reasons for refusing the vaccination before or during this intervention also were obtained. The charts of patients who consented were flagged for the attending physician to order the vaccination if appropriate. Results: Charts of 535 patients were reviewed for pneumococcal vaccination status. Of these patients, 291 had had a pneumococcal vaccination before the study. The cumulative vaccination rate increased significantly from 54 percent to 79 percent after the study intervention. The rate of pneumococcal vaccination was significantly lower among African-Americans than whites both before and after the patient education intervention. Conclusion: This study reports a substantial impact of patient education on improving pneumococcal '> vaccination rates in an elderly population. Most elders accept vaccination, and it can be delivered effectively without an additional visit. (J Am Board Fam Pract 1996;9:411-13.) About 40,000 adults die each year from pneumo\u00ad coccal infections,l and invasive pneumococcal disease is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population. Mortality as\u00ad sociated with pneumococcal disease has been shown to increase with age in patients older than 65 years.2,3 Higher mortality is also associated with underlying chronic diseases, such as conges\u00ad tive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, and alcoholism and cirrhosis.2,4 With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and the increas\u00ad ing number of elderly persons, the death rate re\u00ad sulting from invasive pneumococcal disease is expected to increase.

Methods Charts of all patients aged 65 years or older who visited a university ambulatory care clinic from 20 June 1995 to 19 September 1995 were reviewed by a research nurse for pneumococcal vaccination status before their arrival at the clinic. Those who did not have documented pneumococcal vaccina\u00ad tion were approached to confirm the status. Those who had not been vaccinated were pro\u00ad vided patient education in the waiting room. Pre\u00ad senting the written patient education informa\u00ad tionS and providing a time for questions and answers took approximately 5 minutes.

In addition, the reasons patients chose to refuse vaccination prior to and during this study were also obtained by interview. The charts of the patients who consented to receive the vaccination were flagged for the attending physician to order the immunization if the physician considered the vaccination to be appropriate. The hypothesis test for proportions was used to calculate differences in vaccination rates by sex and race before and after the intervention.'! This study was reviewed and approved by university's Institutional Review Board. Results There were 535 patients aged 65 years or older who visited the clinic during the study period whose charts were reviewed for pneumococcal vaccination status. This group of patients repre\u00ad sented 33 percent of the 1627 active clinic pa\u00ad tients aged 65 years or older. Within the study sample, 204 (38 percent) were male and 331 (62 percent) were female. Of these patients, 291 (54 percent) had had a pneumococcal vaccination be\u00ad fore the study intervention, and 132 received pneumococcal vaccination after the patient edu\u00ad cation intervention in the waiting room.

The data for other racial and ethnic groups were too few for meaningful analy\u00ad sis, and approximately 15 percent of the patients did not have race designated in their charts. Con\u00ad sequently, only the 445 white and African-Ameri\u00ad can patients were included in these analyses. Before their visit, 92 patients had known about the pneumococcal vaccination and had previously chosen not to receive it. The majority who gave reasons why they were not previously vaccinated explained that they were not sick and did not need it or that they had failed to follow up with their physicians. Of these 92 patients, 46 (50 per\u00ad cent) received a vaccination during the study visit, and the remaining 46 refused it. A total of 112 pa\u00ad tients refused the offer of vaccination during the study: the 46 who continued to refuse vaccination and 66 patients who refused vaccination after learning about it during the study visit. Most of these patients wanted more time to make their decision and stated that they did not get sick, were afraid of injections, or feared side effects. Discussion This study reports a substantial impact of patient education on improving pneumococcal vaccina\u00ad tion rates in an elderly patient population. Most elders accept vaccination, which can be offered The pneumococcal vaccination rates for both sexes before and after the inter\u00ad vention were similar, and for both men and women there was a statistically sig\u00ad nificant increase in the vaccination rate after the intervention (T~lble 1).

The effectiveness of the vaccination in elderly patients decreases with age, however, so it is important that patients be vaccinated soon after their 65th birthday, when they are in better health and have a better re\u00ad sponse to the vaccination.IO,11 Because in our study approximately one third of the total num\u00ad ber of elderly patients active in the clinic were seen during the study period, it is reasonable to assume that most elderly patients can be seen in their clinic or informed by mail about the need for pneumococcal vaccination. The initial vaccination rate in this study before the intervention was higher than the national cu\u00ad mulative pneumococcal vaccination rate of 28.2 percent. As no previous interventions were con\u00ad ducted in this clinic to increase the pneumococcal vaccination rate, it is unclear why the clinic rate was higher than the national average. The findings of this study are consistent with those of earlier studies reporting no statistical dif\u00ad ference in the pneumococcal vaccination rate by sex and a lower rate for Mrican-Americans com\u00ad pared with whites.6 A similar lower influenza vac\u00ad cination rate among African-Americans has also been reported.6,12 The racial differences could be explained by such factors as socioeconomic status, access to health care; and other risk factors.3,6 Most of the unvaccinated patients were not aware that vaccination was available. Others knew about the vaccination but made a decision not to receive it, sometimes for uninformed reasons. This finding underscores the need to educate pa\u00ad tients about pneumococcal vaccination and re\u00ad mind health care providers to offer it. The accep\u00ad tance of pneumococcal vaccination by elderly patients and health care providers can also be en\u00ad hanced by two additional factors: the current rec\u00ad ommendation of only a single lifetime dose, and reimbursement by Medicare. 13 To achieve the national health objective for the year 2000, family physicians should increase pa\u00ad tient education about pneumococcal vaccination and patient awareness of its availability. It is possi\u00ad ble to improve the pneumococcal vaccination rate through patient education in an outpatient clinic. The patient education brochure used in this study was obtained from the National Institute on Ag\u00ad ing at no cost.H Making such materials available to patients in the waiting room augments vaccina\u00ad tion efforts. Awareness can be increased further through reminders and the annual influenza vac\u00ad cination campaign in the media. References l. Williams ww, Hickson MA, Kane MA, Kendal AP, Spika ]S, Hinman AR.
