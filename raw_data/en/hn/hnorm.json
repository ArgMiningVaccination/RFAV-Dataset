The goal of the Pathogens, Vaccines, & Immunity group is to advance understanding of host-pathogen interactions and have a direct impact on human and animal health through translational research. We intensively study the biology of viral, bacterial, protozoal and helminth pathogens and how they interact with their hosts at the molecular, cellular and systems levels, particularly with regard to pathogenesis and immunity. This knowledge is applied to the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, novel vaccines and other medical countermeasures, including antibiotics, antivirals, small interfering molecules and detection/diagnostic devices for the protection of human and animal health against infectious diseases and cancer.
