{"title": "Efficacy of Individualized Homeopathy in Treatment-Resistant Depression", "author": "Noheli Zepeda-Quiroz; Rodolfo Luna-Res\u00e9ndiz; Jacqueline Soto-S\u00e1nchez", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Treatment-resistant major depression (TRD), defined as an insufficient response to at least two antidepressant treatments, is usually treated with antidepressants, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and vagus nerve stimulation or combinations of these. However, the response rate is modest and, on many occasions, insufficient or nonexistent. Here, we describe the case of a 19-year-old woman with a history of TRD, treated for depression since the age of five years. Her symptoms were resistant to fluoxetine, escitalopram, atomoxetine, and psychotherapy. Individualized homeopathic treatment with Staphisagria, Nux vomica, Arsenicum album, and Lachesis trigonocephalus was started. Posology was carried out in 200CH dynamizations. Treatment was prescribed for four months. This led to an immediate improvement in mood and a sustained and gradual reduction of depressive symptoms and, consequently, a reduction and then cessation of medication with antidepressants and psychotherapy. At follow-up eight months later, the patient is free of depression and medication. This case study reconfirms the usefulness of homeopathy in the treatment of depression. It also suggests that individualized homeopathic treatment may be useful in cases of treatment-resistant depression.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2021-10-02", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
