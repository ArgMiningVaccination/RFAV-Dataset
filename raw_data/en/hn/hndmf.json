Students are required to be physically present in the United States to complete degree requirements. All degree requirements must be completed within a maximum of eight years. A cumulative grade-point average of at least 3.0 must be maintained for all KU graduate coursework. Curriculum Outline The following courses must be successfully completed to obtain the doctorate degree. These courses were specifically selected to enhance communication, collaboration and leadership skills, in addition to research skills and clinical nutrition skills. Communication, Collaboration and Leadership Core - DN 903 Nutrition Communication for Advanced Practice, 3 credits - DN 910: Leadership Essentials in Clinical Nutrition, 3 credits - DN 950: Interprofessional Collaboration, 2 credits - DCLS 880: Principles of Interprofessional Education and Practice Theory, 1 credit Research Core (12 credits) - DN 930 Evidence Analysis in Clinical Nutrition, 3 credits - DN 932 Ethics in Clinical Nutrition Research, 1 credit - DN 934 Advanced Methods of Research in Clinical Nutrition, 3 credits - DN 941 Applied Nutrition Epidemiology, 3 credits - NURS 938 Informatics and Technology Applications, 2 credits Clinical Nutrition Core (18 credits) - DN 915 Advanced Nutritional Assessment, 3 credits - DN 838 Advanced Medical Nutrition Therapy, 3 credits - DN 870 Health Behavior Counseling, 3 credits - DN 970 Pharmacology in Clinical Nutrition, 3 credits - DN 980 Nutrigenomics & Nutrigenetics in Health and Disease, 3 credits - One elective (see list, below), 3 credits DN 992 Advanced Clinical Nutrition Residency, 360 hours at workplace, 3 credits DN 991 Applied Research Project, 6 credits Advanced Clinical Nutrition Residency The residency experience is designed to span 360 hours and will be completed within a professional workplace setting. Students will identify an area of practice through which they will provide leadership to develop a research-based clinical initiative or program. Upon completion, the student will provide their clinical team with the program or clinical initiative, along with program evaluation methods. Applied Research Project Students will complete a planned and approved research project which is advisor-guided, student-directed, and designed to enhance the ability to apply graduate knowledge to achieve tangible and relevant outcomes. All aspects of a translational research project will be included (i.e., planning, data collection, analysis and interpretation of results, preparation, and oral presentation of the project). The goal is a manuscript suitable for publication. Collaborative interprofessional patient care projects are strongly encouraged. Students actively working on their research project must maintain active enrollment each semester while in the research phase by enrolling in a suitable and repeatable course (DN 991). The final oral defense of the research project will be scheduled after the final draft of the manuscript has been accepted by the student's graduate committee. The oral examination is a defense of the manuscript and can include questions about knowledge of clinical nutrition concepts and applications. Elective Course Options Students select one elective class from the following list as part of clinical nutrition core requirements: - DN 829 Nutrition in Aging - DN 837 Nutrition in Diabetes - DN 839 Clinical Aspects of Nutrition Support - DN 842 U.S. Public Health Nutrition - DN 865 Nutrition in Sports & Exercise - DN 875 Pediatric Clinical Nutrition - DN 876 Interventions for Prevention & Management of Obesity - DN 880 Dietary and Herbal Supplements - DN 881 Intro to Dietetics and Integrative Medicine - DN 882 Nutrition Approach to Inflammation Immune Regulation - DN 884 Diet, Physical Activity and Cancer - DN 885 Nutritional Biochemistry - DN 895 Advanced Macronutrients and Integrated Metabolism - DN 896 Advanced Micronutrients and Integrated Metabolism Vaccines and Clinical Site Requirements The University of Kansas Medical Center requires various immunizations for its students. For a detailed list please visit the [student health forms webpage](/academic-and-student-affairs/departments/student-health-services/forms.html) or speak with Student Health Services. These immunization requirements help promote health and safety and facilitate clinical placement. Many, if not all, clinical sites who partner with the University of Kansas Medical Center require proof of these vaccines for students engaged in training or other programmatic experiences at clinical sites. Not being vaccinated may preclude students from participating in activities, potentially impeding their ability to complete all program requirements for degree completion. Applicants with questions should speak with a representative from the academic program to which they intend to apply. "}
