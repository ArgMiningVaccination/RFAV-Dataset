Vitamin E Vitamin E is a group of eight fat-soluble compounds known for their antioxidant properties. These compounds support adrenal gland function by reducing oxidative stress, which can exacerbate adrenal fatigue.

The cost of L-theanine supplements can vary based on the dosage and the brand. 6.
