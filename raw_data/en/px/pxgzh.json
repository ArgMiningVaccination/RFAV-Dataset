They believe that adverse reactions stimulate the immune system, helping to ward off other potentially fatal conditions. They found that asthmatics were 30 per cent less likely to get ovarian cancer than others, and children with allergies to airborne substances were 40 per cent less likely to develop leukemia than other youngsters. Protection: Having an allergy can stimulate the immune system and help to protect against cancer and other potentially fatal conditions 'More work is still needed, but the numbers show that allergy is a statistically significant protective factor,' said Dr Zuber Mulla, an epidemiologist at Texas Tech University, who led the ovarian cancer study. Medical researchers have long suspected an association between allergies and cancer, but studies have yielded mixed results. However in recent years a clearer picture has emerged which suggests there is a major advantage to putting up with allergies. Doctors at Cornell University in America found children with airborne allergies also had reduced rates of throat, skin, lung and intestinal cancer. Other research has pointed to a lower risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and stomach cancer, while Harvard epidemiologists observed 'a strong inverse relationship' between brain cancer and asthma, eczema, hay fever or allergy. Canadian studies showed that having an allergy or hay fever lowered the chances of getting pancreatic cancer by up to 58 per cent. 'Allergies are a general activation of our immune systems,' said Dr Ronald Crystal, chief of pulmonary and critical-care medicine at Weill Cornell Medical Centre. 'It's hard to prove, and I've heard some scepticism, but it's a concept in this field and the studies add to that.' In Britain the main research into ovarian cancer is the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening, which will assess over the next five years whether a national screening programme would be beneficial. Preliminary findings suggest that ultrasound and a blood test may improve detection rates. Currently there is no screening programme for the condition, the fourth most common cancer in the UK which kills 4,500 women a year. The latest research into leukemia and cancer was carried out at Minnesota University.
