This includes mental, emotional, physical and / or spiritual healing needs through the treatments that I offer. My therapies are unique! We all have an innate power to heal ourselves and the key lies in understanding energy, and releasing blockages that can occur throughout one's lifetime. These blockages can be at many levels within the mind, body or soul. It may take years for issues to develop or suddenly like from an accident but most of the time they can be reversed. I work with my clients in finding the best solution from the many different modalities that I offer. If you have never tried any kind of energy work, NOW is the time! \"Energy is everywhere and in everything!\" Most people are over-stressed and out of balance on a regular basis. So, we all must find the time to help or honor ourselves with self-care. Go out into nature, breathe slowly or just find a place to stop and be quiet for an hour or more. I offer many different ways to do this from energy readings, helpful tools, massage therapy, energy healing, or just click on the Self-Care tab above for more ideas and information. Most of my clients schedule a treatment every one to two months as part of their rejuvenating self-care. I can only assist those who want to be helped, the desire starts with you first! \"Set Yourself free by allowing, and life becomes easy and peaceful.\" This is a reading of your energy & hands-on energy work with Jin Shin Jyutsu during your session. This type of therapy reading is quick at getting to any issues you may be having, currently or in your past. By gaining the knowledge of what may be holding you back, out of balance or being stuck. These are called energy blockages. These blockages can cause pain, suffering or issues within the mind, body or soul energy fields. This is a spiritual counseling session, very powerful! This treatment will help you to release traumas or emotions you may be carrying at the surface, or down deep into the cellular memory or soul level. This can be from experiences you have had stored from your past or recently. It will help with PTSD, depression, anger or resentment, body pains, weight gain or loss, drug usage or abuse, etc. Most people are carrying negative energies, or possibly an entity that needs to be released. You will feel a positive difference almost immediately, but this treatment can be challenging as you go through the release process, mainly fatigue or sadness for a few days. This allows you to stop, breathe, relax and release tension, and stress. Jin Shin Jyutsu energy healing is extremely therapeutic. It works by touching simple pressure points throughout the body. My hands become a jumper cable in unblocking your energy pathways. An ancient Japanese art that aids or heals any ailment being physical, mental, or emotional. This art form works on any negative energy from ones lifestyle, diet and/or attitudes to harmonize energy which can lead to pain, suffering and fatigue. Jin Shin Jyutsu works well for specific needs like migraines, TMJ, insomnia, high cholesterol, arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic back pain, digestive problems, carpal tunnel, leg or foot pain, high blood pressure and cancer treatments.. the list is endless! And stress just melts away. These massages reaches deeper layers of muscles. It is used to break down knots and very tight muscles throughout the body. This massage is beneficial for high stressed individuals, athletes and those who sit for long periods of time or travel. I will work with you on finding the right amount of pressure for your needs. It's a Swedish/Relaxation, Deep Tissue, and Sports massage blend. Energy reading therapy, treatment and consultation This is the most powerful and healing treatment therapy. I will read your body and soul energy during the session and share this information with you. It also includes a Jin Shin Jyutsu treatment (see below). This treatment helps you to connect to your true self and discovering or releasing locked/blocked energy. Which can be negativity that may be causing pain, suffering or imbalance at any level.

These phone appointments are paid at the beginning before your session starts by a Zelle, credit or debit card. This is a Japanese energy healing art that is very relaxing.
