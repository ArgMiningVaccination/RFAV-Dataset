Juice cleanse. Colon cleanse. Whole-body cleanse. Weekend cleanse. Twenty-four-hour cleanse. Master cleanse. The list goes on. Before we get too far down the road of exploring seasonal Ayurvedic cleansing, it is important to note what IT IS NOT: -A quick way to drop 20 lbs. -A quick fix for reversing the impact of years of bad eating -A quick way to detox your liver from partying -A quick remedy for persistent constipation Notice a common thread? What you will not find on that coveted first page of results is \"Ayurvedic cleanse.\" It's ironic, but not surprising. Ayurveda teaches a time-tested approach to gently detoxifying, re-calibrating and rejuvenating\u2014seasonally. The science pioneered the practice of seasonal clean-ups thousands of years ago, so there's nothing trendy about it! Ayurvedic Knowledge [Ayurveda](https://www.ayureka.com/ayurveda-explained/) is grounded in the understanding that your body is a complex, intelligent creation. When you're \"hitting on all cylinders,\" you feel vibrant...and vice versa. The practice of Ayurveda centers on enabling the body's natural intelligence to do the work it was designed to do. When your natural intelligence has what it needs\u2014in the form of nutrition, sleep, exercise, love, etc.\u2014it operates efficiently. You are able to remain healthy without pharmaceuticals, supplements or elective surgery. Like Einstein, Ayurveda recognizes that everything is energy. We reside in nature, so the energies of the universe (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) are present in everyone. We are all [unique](https://www.ayureka.com/2013/11/19/ayurveda-101-you-are-unique/) and continuously changing. Nature has a significant influence on our wellbeing, particularly during seasonal transitions when its energies wax and wane. For example, spring's Kapha energy brings a heavy \"juiciness.\" If the body's channels are clear, the increased unctuousness can flow freely. However, if the body's channels are blocked, this increase can create aggravations. When this happens, colds, allergies and lethargy can begin to surface as the weather changes. As a matter of practicality, your natural intelligence needs support to get back on track. The theory is that, when done regularly, a cleanse \"cleans up\" the indiscretions of the previous few months and provides support for upcoming months. Its three main objectives are: - Bring the biological energies into alignment - Clear Ama (a Sanskrit word for toxins, gook, blockages), and - Rejuvenate the body. It is only through these linked practices that one can clean up and support in the same initiative. Cleanse Process An Ayurvedic seasonal cleanse is like a gentle \"recalibration.\" Knowing that your natural intelligence can keep you healthy if given what it needs, a seasonal transition is a time to step back and figure out what it is lacking. What diet and lifestyle habits are not serving you well? Are you sleeping enough? How nutritious are your meals? How loving are your relationships? It is a time to rethink and make simple changes to help maintain your wellbeing. Check it out. We recently wrote about a few of the compelling reasons to undergo an Ayurvedic seasonal cleanse (or [spring tune-up]). Here is an overview of how Ayurveda can help you get there: #1: Get Conscious Ayurveda is all about getting to the root cause of a problem. And nothing helps that search along like critical reflection and self-awareness. Cleansing starts with taking the time to think about what you need for alignment. Journaling is a great tool for supporting this effort. Sitting, meditation and breath-work are also tools to help build awareness. During the initial phase, it is important to \"wind down\" into a more simplified whole-foods diet, regular sleep and a less complicated daily routine. These steps support both the physical and emotional aspects of a cleanse. Change takes energy. Being rested and nourished is how you achieve this. Chemical-filled foods, stimulants, irregular routines and intense exercise all undermine your healthy objectives. #2: Focused Clean-Up This phase of an Ayurvedic seasonal cleanse lasts for about five days. During this period, the focus is on eating a simple, nutritious, whole-foods-mono-diet; sipping warm water or tea; getting plenty of [sleep](https://www.ayureka.com/2014/03/19/difficulties-falling-asleep-look-here/); partaking in light exercise; and living a relaxed lifestyle. This is when you let go of everyday stresses and give your body time to recalibrate. \"Tools of the Trade\" Baking soda\u2014for a nightly bath Fresh ginger\u2014for a fresh tea Massage oil\u2014sesame (Vata's ingredients\u2014mung beans, basmati rice and spices (for the mono diet during the cleanse phase) Ghee\u2014Clarified butter used to lubricate the GI track Castor oil\u2014Used to break-up congestion in the body and as a purgative The typical cleanse whole-foods-mono-diet is a traditional Indian staple called kitchadi, which is split and shelled mung beans, basmati rice, steamed vegetables and spices of choice. This offers your body all nine essential amino acids (i.e. your protein). It is a low-resolution diet, which means that it is very easy to digest. It is easy to fix (keep your stress level low!). And it is yummy! In addition to eating a mono diet, it is suggested to sip hot water throughout the day. (On its own, this simple action can be a \"mini cleanse.\") Sip every 10-15 minutes\u2014or as often as practical\u2014to hydrate the body. This enables it to detoxify itself. When guided by an Ayurvedic practitioner, this phase might also include ingesting increasing amounts of warm ghee (clarified butter used for GI tract lubrication) each morning. This practice, coupled with daily oil massages, is known to help the body's impurities to move. Other Ayurvedic practices might include herbs, purgatives, enemas and/or nasal passage cleansings. #3: Thoughtful Re-integration In keeping with the gentle nature of Ayurvedic cleansing, you are encouraged to thoughtfully reintegrate back into everyday life. From a practical perspective, after eating a mono diet (and possibly administering a purgative), you want to be careful not to shock your system. From the perspective of supporting your natural intelligence, it might be time to re-think what practices aren't serving you. This can be a contemplative period as you decide what diet and lifestyle changes you want to integrate into your everyday life going forward. A week or so of \"clean living\" might be enough to help you question going back to drinking three cups of coffee daily or two glasses of wine after work. The good news is that if you are not ready for changes yet, Ayurvedic seasonal cleanses should be undertaken regularly. This way they help you gently shift behaviors. Over time, seasonal cleanses help to bring unsupportive habits to light. It becomes more clear what no longer serves you. Wholesome practices begin to replace the unhealthy ones of the past. When guided by an Ayurvedic practitioner, reintegration generally involves a rasayana. This is a Sanskrit term for a rejuvenative. This often involves herbs, and emphasizes that ample sleep and whole foods are important to restore any depletion from the cleanse practice. Done regularly, the practice of getting conscious, engaging in a focused clean-up and thoughtfully re-integrating into daily life has a transformative effect on your wellbeing. An Ayurvedic seasonal cleanse should be considered a time to explore what supports your life\u2014what helps to bring you health and happiness. Embrace it with an open heart and mind, and you'll be amazed by the outcome. Interested in learning more?
