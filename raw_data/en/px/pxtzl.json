Holistic health care acknowledges that mental, physical, emotional, social, and spiritual health are all interconnected and important. Integrative health care brings health to a whole new level. Each individual is assessed holistically, and then given a team of multidisciplinary professionals to implement care. Adjunct therapies such as Reiki, Reflexology, or massage are never a replacement for medical attention or medication. Rather, they work well together. Always check with your primary care provider prior to starting anything new. Better Sleep Learn about how a better night's sleep can help you below. Ready to take it to the next level?
