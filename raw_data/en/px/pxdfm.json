Merck Sharp & Dohme. West Point, United States. Biological E Ltd. Telengana, India. General characteristics The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is a colorless to slightly yellow, clear to very opalescent sterile suspension for intramuscular injection. The vaccine consists of a replication-incompetent recombinant adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector expressing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein in a stabilized conformation [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) ]. The Ad26 vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is grown in PER.C6\u00ae TetR Cell Line, in media containing amino acids and no animal-derived proteins. After propagation, the vaccine is processed through several purification steps, formulated with inactive ingredients and filled into vials [ [FDA, 2021](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download) ]. Ingredients The vaccine contains the following ingredients: Active ingredient The active substance is Adenovirus type 26 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (Ad26.COV2-S) no less than 2.5 x 1010 virus particles or no less than 8.92 log10 infectious units (IU) in each 0.5 Sodium hydroxide Hydrochloric acid Water for injections Risk considerations The vaccine is based on the Ad26 vector platform. Clinical experience with this platform consists of the Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo Ebola vaccine regimen, and vaccines against Zika, filovirus, HIV, HPV, malaria and respiratory syncytial virus. Almost 200,000 participants have used Ad26-based vaccines in clinical studies and vaccination programs with an acceptable clinical safety profile [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19_VaccineJanssenPEG-TAG_ReportEUL.pdf) ]. Dosing and schedule The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is administered as one dose of 0.5 mL or as a series of two doses (0.5 mL each). WHO recommends two doses administrated 2-6 months apart. The updated results from Phase 3 trials suggest that a two-dose scheme has higher efficacy for symptomatic infection and severe disease compared to a single dose [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. If administration of the second dose is inadvertently delayed beyond 6 months, it should be given as soon as possible. The pharmaceutical form is a suspension for intramuscular injection provided in a multidose vial (5 doses of 0.5 mL per vial) [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) ]. The preferred site of injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Considerations for two versus one dose [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ] WHO recommends taking all efforts to provide two doses of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, particularly for the high priority-use groups. WHO recommends an inter-dose interval of up to 6 months since a longer interval increases humoral immune responses. If countries face severe vaccine supply constraints or vaccine delivery challenges, it can be considered the use of a single dose. A single dose may also be a preferred option for vaccinating hard-to-reach populations (for example, refugees and migrants or remote communities). Booster dose [ [FDA, 2023](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-roundup-march-14-2023) ] The vaccine may be administered as a first booster dose at least 2 months after completion of primary vaccination with a vaccine against COVID-19 authorized or approved Heterologous schedule [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ] When a second dose is provided, the current standard practice is to use the same product to complete a primary series. However, WHO supports a flexible approach to using different EUL COVID-19 vaccine products for different doses (heterologous schedule). Recommendations will be updated as further information becomes available on interchangeability between vaccine products and platforms. Vaccination schedule for immunocompromised persons [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ] WHO recommends a second dose for all moderately and severely immunocompromised persons aged 18 years and older, provided 1-3 months after the first dose. Indications and contraindications Indications The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is indicated for individuals18 years and over [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. Contraindications The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is contraindicated for individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. (See the list of ingredients under 'General characteristics' in the extended version). The second dose of the vaccine should NOT BE GIVEN to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose. People who have had thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following the first dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should not receive a second dose of the same vaccine [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. Precautions Allergic reactions [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. As for all COVID-19 vaccines, the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should be given under health care supervision, with an observation period of 15 min after vaccination. Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. A very rare syndrome of blood clotting combined with low platelet counts, which is described as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been reported following vaccination with the first dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. A causal relationship between the vaccine and TTS is considered plausible although the biological mechanism for this syndrome is still being investigated. No TTS cases have been reported after a second or subsequent dose. Myocarditis [ [FDA, 2023](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-roundup-march-14-2023) ] Reporting of advers events probably increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within the period 0 to 7 days after vaccination There is a considerable geographical variation regarding the reported incidence since most of these cases were notified from the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) and very few from non-European countries, despite the extensive use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in these countries. In countries with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the benefit of vaccination in protecting against COVID-19 far outweighs the risks. However, benefit-risk assessments may differ from country to country. As data from additional studies become available, enabling a better understanding of the pathophysiology of TTS and its relationship to the vaccine, recommendations on vaccination will be updated. Neurological events [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) has been reported very rarely following vaccination with the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Based on the available data, the potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine continue to outweigh any potential risk of GBS, particularly given the increase in the more transmissible variants. Health workers should be alert to possible signs and symptoms of GBS to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis (or to rule out other causes) and management of potential cases. Pregnancy [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ] WHO recommends the use of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women only if the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy, the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiologic context, and the current limitations of the safety data in pregnant women WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination. Breastfeeding [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults. Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is not a live virus vaccine and it is biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. Based on this considerations, WHO recommends the use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination. Children and adolescents [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. There are currently no efficacy or safety data on the use of Ad26.COV2.S in persons below the age of 18 years. Until such data are available, vaccination of individuals below 18 years of age is not routinely recommended. Older persons [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. Vaccination is recommended for older persons without an upper age limit Persons living with HIV [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. Persons living with HIV who are well controlled on highly active antiretroviral therapy should be vaccinated. It is not necessary to test for HIV infection before administration of the vaccine. Persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. Vaccination may be offered regardless of a person's history of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The optimal time interval between a natural infection and vaccination is not yet known. An interval of 3 months could be considered. Persons who previously received passive antibody therapy for COVID-19[ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ] Although some reduction in vaccine-induced antibody titers has been observed in this group, the balance of benefits versus risks favors vaccination. Co-administration with other vaccines [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-Sinovac-CoronaVac-2021.1) ]. Persons with current acute COVID-19 [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for discontinuation of isolation have been met. Other precautions EMA recommends that individuals who have previously had capillary leak syndrome must not be vaccinated with the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the signs and symptoms of capillary leak syndrome and of its risk of recurrence in people who have previously been diagnosed with the condition. Vaccinated individuals should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience rapid swelling of the arms and legs or sudden weight gain in the days following vaccination. These symptoms are often associated with feeling faint (due to low blood pressure) [ [EMA, 2021](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-advises-against-use-covid-19-vaccine-janssen-people-history-capillary-leak-syndrome#:~:text=EMA%20has%20reviewed%20cases%20of,can%20be%20fatal%20if%20untreated.) ]. As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution for individuals with bleeding disorders or other conditions that increase the risk of bleeding, such as anticoagulant therapy, thrombocytopenia and hemophilia [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) ]. Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with an acute febrile illness (body temperature over 38.5\u00baC) until they are afebrile [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, in particular in adolescents. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) ]. Co-administration with other vaccines [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. For adults, COVID-19 vaccines may be administered concomitantly or at any time before or after other adult vaccines, including: live attenuated vaccines, inactivated, adjuvanted, or non-adjuvanted vaccines. When administered concomitantly, the vaccines should be injected at separate sites, preferably different extremities. Storage and logistics Storage The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is provided as a frozen suspension stored at -25\u00baC to -15\u00b0C (-13\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F) for up to 24 months [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) ]. The shelf life of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is up to 11 months stored between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) product to 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) storage, the updated expiry date must be written on the outer carton and the vaccine should be used or discarded by the updated expiry date [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) ]. Do not refreeze once thawed. Store in the original carton to protect from light. Administration logistics Thaw in refrigerator: When stored frozen at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C (-13\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F), a carton of 10 vials will take approximately 12 hours to thaw or, individual vials will take approximately 2 hours to thaw at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). Thaw at room frozen at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C (-13\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F), a carton of 10 vials or individual vials should be thawed at room temperature maximally 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). A carton of 10 vials will take approximately 2 hours to thaw. Individual vials will take approximately 1 hour to thaw. The vaccine should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The vial should be inspected visually for cracks or any abnormalities, such as evidence of tampering prior to administration. If any of these should exist, do not administer the vaccine. Before administering a dose of vaccine, swirl the vaccine in an upright position for 10 seconds. Do not shake [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) ]. Use a sterile needle and syringe to extract a single dose of 0.5 mL from the multidose vial. A maximum of 5 doses can be withdrawn from the multidose vial. After, administered by intramuscular injection. Discard any remaining vaccine in the vial after the extraction of 5 doses. Storage after first puncture After the first puncture of the vial, preferably use immediately [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) ]. After taking the first dose from the multidose vial, the vial should be used immediately or held at 2-8\u00baC for up to 6 hours. Discard after 6 hours or at the end of the immunization session, whichever comes first [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1) ]. Record the date and time the vial should be discarded. To improve traceability, the name and batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) ]. Administration [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) ] 1. Before administering a dose of vaccine, swirl the vial gently in an upright position for 10 seconds. Do not shake 2. Use a sterile needle and sterile syringe to extract a single dose of 0.5 mL from the multi-dose vial 3. Administer by intramuscular injection only (0.5 mL) into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. A maximum of 5 doses can be withdrawn from the multi-dose vial. Discard any remaining vaccine in the vial after 5 doses have been extracted Disposal Any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed of in compliance with the local guidance for pharmaceutical waste. Potential spills should be disinfected with agents with viricidal activity against adenovirus [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-janssen-cilag-international-nv-belgium-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2-s) ]. Due to the high risk that discarded vials of COVID-19 vaccines may be recovered, it is essential that they are guaranteed to be safely disposed of at the site of use; or study the possibility of applying reverse logistics, if the safe treatment and disposal of vaccine residues cannot be guaranteed, so that they are transferred to the place established for that purpose. Otherwise, consider the possibility that the discarded vaccine vials are shredded, if there is a safe way to do so [ [WHO, 2021](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/339561) ]. Clinical studies - general characteristics The following randomized clinical trials have reported vaccine efficacy and/or safety data: Phase 1: The COV1002 trial, (NCT04509947 [ [Janssen Pharmaceutical K.K., 2020](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04509947) ]) conducted in Japan, started in August 2020, included 250 adults (Cohort 1, 20 to 55 years of age, N = 125; Cohort 2, 65 years of age, N = 125) who were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive the vaccine Ad26.COV2.S 5 \u00d7 1010 viral particles (vp), Ad26.COV2.S 1 \u00d7 1011 vp, or placebo. [ [Tsuchiya Y, ] Phase 1/2: The COV1001 trial, (NCT04436276 [ [Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., 2020](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04436276) ]) conducted in the United States since July 2020 included 25 people in phase 1, who received 1 or 2 doses of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (5 \u00d7 1010 or 1\u00d71011 viral particles) or placebo in days 1 and 57 (5 individuals per group). In phase 1/2 participants received a dose of Janssen (5 \u00d7 1010 viral particles) followed by a booster dose of 5 \u00d7 1010 viral particles or 1.25 \u00d7 1010 viral particles or placebo. [ [Sadoff J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2034201) ], [ [Sadoff J, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.05.047) ], [ [Alter G, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03681-2) ], [ [Stephenson KE, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.3645) ] Phase 2: The COV2001 trial (NCT04535453, [ [Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., 2020](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04535453) ]), conducted in Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands, started in September 2020, included 635 adolescents (12-17 years) and adults (18 years or older). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 10 groups. Groups 1-6 were randomized 3:3:3:3:3:1 to vaccination with 1 or 2 doses 56 days apart or placebo. Groups 7 and 8 were randomized 2:1 to receive 2 doses of vaccine 28 days apart or placebo. Groups 9 and 10 were randomized 2:1 to receive 2 doses of vaccine 84 days apart or placebo. [ [Sablerolles RSG, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2116747) ] The BOOST-TX trial (NCT04614948, [ [Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., 2020](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04614948) ]) conducted in Austria since May 2021, included 197 adult kidney transplant recipients after 2 months of receiving an mRNA vaccine.

This means Janssen COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting any symptomatic COVID-19 in 64%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: contracting any symptomatic COVID-19. Comparison: Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the available trial 1082 people not receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine out of 19398 presented this outcome (45 per 1000) versus 495 out of 19400 in the group that did receive it (16 per 1000). In other words, 29 less people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 2.9%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting any symptomatic COVID-19 by 2.9 percentage points.

Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Contracting moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 (measured at least 14 days after the injection) The relative risk of contracting moderate to severe COVID-19 in the group that received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.36 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.64).

Mortality The existing evidence does not allow to assess the impact of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine on the risk of mortality. The information provided by randomized trials was not adequately powered to estimate a difference in this outcome. Deaths can occur in the intervention and control group for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or the vaccine. Establishing that there is a reduction (or increase) in the risk of death attributable to Janssen COVID-19 vaccine would require trials with a higher statistical power.

Summary of findings (iSoF) Efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccine in subgroups Sex Randomized trials The proportion of women in the ENSEMBLE trial was 45% (19722 out of 43783 participants) [ [Sadoff J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544) ]. Among women, the relative risk of contracting moderate to severe COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days or 28 days after vaccination, when comparing with the group that received placebo vaccine, was 0.37 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.47). This means that, in relative terms, Janssen COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 in 63%, compared with the placebo vaccine. This estimate is not importantly different from the one in males and in the overall population of the trial, for this outcome. Age Randomized trials The proportion of participants 65 years of age and more in the ENSEMBLE trial was 19.6% (8561 out of 43783 participants) [ [Sadoff J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544) ]. Among participants 65 years or older, the relative risk of contracting moderate to severe COVID-19, with onset at least 14 or 28 days after vaccination, when comparing the group that received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine, was 0.24 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.41). This means that, in relative terms, Janssen COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 in 76%, compared with the placebo vaccine. This number is not importantly different from the estimate for this outcome in younger patients, and in the overall population of the trial ENSEMBLE 2 was a randomized clinical trial that included 31 300 participants: 15 ,708 in vaccine group and 15, 592 in placebo group. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen) as primary vaccination plus a booster dose. Vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe-critical COVID-19 in people over 60 years of age was 66.2% (95 CI, -14.0- 92.2). [ [Hardt K, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00506-0) ] Children and adolescents Randomized trials Children were excluded from the ENSEMBLE trial, therefore no efficacy data are available from participants aged 17 years and younger [ [Sadoff J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544) ]. The randomized phase 2 ongoing trial COV2001 (CR108854 and VAC31518COV2001) is currently evaluating the efficacy/safety of the vaccine in adolescents (12-17 years) and adults (18 years or older) [ [Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., 2020](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04535453) ].

Breastfeeding Randomized trials Breastfeeding women were excluded from the ENSEMBLE trial, therefore no efficacy data are available [ [Sadoff J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544) ]. Immunocompromised persons Randomized trials The proportion of individuals living with HIV in the ENSEMBLE trial was 2.8% (1218 out of 43783 participants) [ [Sadoff J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544) ]. The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 in participants with HIV that received the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 1.07 (95% CI 0.31 to 3.66). This number is not importantly different from the estimate for this outcome in the overall population of the trial. The ongoing phase 2, randomized, single-blinded study BOOST-TX is currently evaluating the efficacy/safety of the vaccine in kidney transplant recipients in Austria [ [Medical University of Vienna, 2021](https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2021-002927-39/AT) ]. At the four-week follow-up of BOOST-TX, 197 kidney transplant recipients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies after two doses of an mRNA vaccine were included: 99 received a 3rd dose of the same RNA vaccine, and 98 received a 3rd dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. The primary endpoint was seroconversion after four weeks (29-42 days) following the third vaccine dose. Secondary endpoints included neutralizing antibodies and T-cell response assessed by interferon- release assays (IGRA). Four weeks after the third vaccination, 76 patients had developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein(>0.8 U/mL) for an overall response rate of 39%. There was no statistically significant difference between the homologous and heterologous vaccination strategies, with a response rate of 35% vs 42% for mRNA vs Janssen vaccine (OR, 1.31; CI, 0.71-2.44; P = 0.38) [ ]. At the three-month follow-up of BOOST-TX, 201 kidney transplant recipients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies following two doses of an mRNA vaccine were included: 85 received the 3rd dose of the same RNA vaccine, and 84 received the 3rd dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Study participants were followed up for antibody assessment at the outpatient transplant clinic of the Medical University of Vienna for a second follow-up between 60 and 120 days after the 3rd vaccine dose. Results showed that absolute antibody titers between the two groups were not significantly different (median mRNA: 0.2 U/ml and vector: 0.81 U/ml, p=0.104). However, when examining higher antibody cut-off levels at the 1-month follow up, a significantly higher number of patients in the Janssen group reached antibody levels above 141 and 264 BAU/ml (>141 BAU/ml: 4 vs. 1 vs. 10% = CI: 1.13 to 396.17, p =0.018, for mRNA vs. Janssen vaccine groups, respectively). [ [Heinzel A, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.936126) ] RECOVAC was a randomized trial conducted in the Netherlands that enrolled 333 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) who did not seroconvert after mRNA vaccination: 230 KTRs were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 manner to receive 100 g mRNA-1273, 2 \u00d7 100 g mRNA-1273, or Ad26.COV2-S vaccination. In addition, 103 KTRs receiving 100 g mRNA-1273, were randomly assigned 1:1 (mycophenolate mofetil-) mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid treatment for 2 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants with a spike protein (S1)-specific IgG concentration of at least 10 binding antibody units per mL at 28 days after vaccination. The seroreponse rates were, 63% (95% CI, 51% Ad26.COV2-S group.

The study included 113,994 patients (33,029 people with HIV and 80,965 people without HIV). The aim of the study was to determine whether HIV status was associated with increased rate or risk of COVID-19 breakthrough infection among fully vaccinated patients in the United States by vaccination type and, among people with HIV, by immune and viral suppression status. The incidence rate of breakthrough infections was higher in people with HIV (55 [95% CI, 52-58] cases per 1000 person-years) vs people without HIV (43 [95% CI, 42-45] cases per 1000 person-years). The breakthrough rate was highest with the Janssen vaccine (70 [95% CI, 63-78] cases per 1000 person-years), followed by Pfizer (54 [95% CI, 52-56] cases per 1000 person-years), and Moderna (34 [ [Coburn SB, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.15934) ] Embi P et al. conducted a case-control study with a test-negative design among eight VISION Network sites in the United States during the Delta variant predominance.

Immunogenicity was assessed 28 days after homologous or heterologous booster vaccination. Results showed that the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and mRNA boosters vaccines were immunogenic in health care workers who had received a priming dose of the Janssen vaccine. In addition, the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 boosters vaccines led to higher T-cell responses than the Janssen COVID-19 booster vaccine. The immune response was 91.7% with the Moderna booster and 91.5% with the Pfizer-BioNTech booster; both performed better than the homologous booster (response, 72.7%) [ [Sablerolles RSG, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2116747) ]. The updated report of the randomized trials COV1001 (phase 1/2a) and COV2001 (phase 2) included a booster dose given 6 months after primary vaccination.

Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness for heterologous booster schedule Immunogenicity outcomes COV-BOOST was a clinical trial that evaluated the immunogenicity of seven different COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose after two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. Efficacy was measured by neutralizing antibody titers at 84 days post-boost dose. The results indicated in general a significant drop between day 28 and day 84 was seen in all study arms for live virus neutralizing antibody and cellular responses. For cellular responses, Moderna (100 g) had the highest cellular responses at D84 (75, 95%CI: 51-110), though not statistically significant compared with Pfizer-BioNTech. The cellular responses at D28 and D84, as well as the D84 to D28 ratio in the AOxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen arms were similar to the Pfizer-BioNTech arm. In the subgroup analysis, similar patterns of immunogenicity were observed in the two age groups (<70 years and >70 years) in both Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech first doses populations. Pfizer-BioNTech-half induced similar humoral and cellular responses compared with Pfizer-BioNTech at D28 and D84. This was seen in populations primed with both Oxford-AstraZeneca/Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech/Pfizer-BioNTech, and in both age groups.

At the four-week follow-up of the randomized trial BOOST-TX conducted in Austria, 197 kidney transplant recipients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies after two doses of an mRNA vaccine were included: 99 received a 3rd dose of the same RNA vaccine, and 98 received a 3rd dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. The primary endpoint was seroconversion after four weeks (29-42 days) following the third vaccine dose. Secondary endpoints included neutralizing antibodies and T-cell response assessed by interferon- release assays (IGRA). Four weeks after the third vaccination, 76 patients had developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein(>0.8 U/mL) for an overall response rate of 39%.

There were no vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-fetal or offspring development. Female rabbits as well as their offspring exhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific antibody titers, indicating that maternal antibodies were transferred to the fetuses during gestation. Additionally, a toxicity study was performed with repeated conventional doses in male rabbits. The vaccine did not show any effects on male sex organs that would impair male fertility [ [EMA, 2021](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/covid-19-vaccine-janssen-epar-product-information_en.pdf) ]. Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported following the administration of adenoviral gene transfer vectors. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is currently unknown. A study in mice showed thrombocytopenia occurred between 5 to 24 hours following adenovirus administration. Some changes induced by the virus were endothelial cell activation, platelet activation and accelerated platelet clearance [ [Othman M, 2007](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/109/7/2832/125650/Adenovirus-induced-thrombocytopenia-the-role-of) ]. Safety of the vaccine in clinical trials Key messages Janssen COVID-19 vaccine increases the risk of local adverse events following vaccination Janssen COVID-19 vaccine reduces the risk of serious adverse events Main safety outcomes of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine Any unsolicited adverse event (during 28 days post-vaccination) The relative risk of any unsolicited adverse event in the group that received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 1.09 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.23). This means Janssen COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of any unsolicited adverse event by 9%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: any unsolicited adverse event. Comparison: Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 407 people not receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine out of 3380 presented this outcome (120 per 1000) versus 440 out of 3356 in the group that did receive it (131 per 1000). In other words, 11 more people per 1000 did develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 1.1%. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H). In this case, the NNTH is 91, which means that 91 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to experience an unsolicited adverse event. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Local adverse events (7 days following vaccination) The relative risk of local adverse events in the group that received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 2.95 (95% CI 2.47 to 3.52). This means that, in relative terms, Janssen COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of local adverse events by 195%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: local adverse events . Comparison: Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 657 people not receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine out of 3380 presented this outcome (194 per 1000) versus 1685 out of 3356 in the group that did receive it (501 per 1000). In other words, the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 30.7% of local adverse events following vaccination. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number of people needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H). In this case, the NNTH is 3, which means that 3 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to experience a local adverse event. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Systemic adverse events (7 days following vaccination) The relative risk of systemic adverse events in the group that received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 1.61 (95% CI 1.48 to 1.75). This means that, in relative terms, Janssen COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of systemic adverse events by 61%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: systemic adverse events . Comparison: Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 1185 people not receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine out of 3380 presented this outcome (351 per 1000) versus 1850 out of 3356 in the group that did receive it (552 per 1000). In other words, 201 more people per 1000 did develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 20.1%. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H). In this case, the NNTH is 5, which means that 5 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to experience a systemic adverse event. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Serious adverse events (during 28 days post-vaccination) The relative risk of serious adverse events in the group that received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.86 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.16). No statistically significant differences between groups were found for serious adverse events. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: serious adverse events. Comparison: Janssen COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 96 people not receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine out of 21888 presented this outcome (4 per 1000) versus 83 out of 21895 in the group that did receive it (3 per 1000). In other words, 1 less people per 1000 did develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 0.1%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of serious adverse events by 0.1 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H). In this case, the NNTB is 1000, which means that 1000 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not experience a severe adverse event Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as moderate The certainty of the evidence is based in the following judgments: Risk of bias: no Publication bias: no concerns. Summary of findings table (iSoF) Safety of the vaccine in subgroups Sex Randomized trials The ENSEMBLE trial showed no differences between sex regarding advers events [ [Sadoff J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544) ]. Age Randomized trials The frequency of adverse effects in the vaccinated/not vaccinated population according to age was the following: Solicited local adverse reactions \u00b7 59.8 vs 20.2 (RR 2.96; difference: 39.6 percentage points) in the group 18-59 years. \u00b7 35.4 vs 18.3 (RR 1.93; difference: 17.1 percentage points) in the group 60 years.

Safety of the vaccine post-authorization Comparative studies Edelman A et al. was a cohort study conducted in the United States. The study enrolled 3,959 participants: 1,556 control group. Based on prospectively tracked menstrual cycle data using the application \"Natural Cycles\", between October 2020 and September 2021, the study assessed whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination is associated with changes in cycle or menses length in those receiving vaccination as compared with an unvaccinated cohort. The study results showed a change in menstrual cycle length of less than 1 day compared with prevaccine cycles. The study also reports a mean change of 0.64 days, (98.75% CI 0.27-1.01) after the first dose and a mean change of 0.79 days, (98.75% CI 0.40-1.18) after the second dose when comparing with unvaccinated individuals [ [Edelman A, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000004695) ]. Wesselink AK et al. was a cohort study conducted in the United States and Canada. The study enrolled 2,126 participants: 1,299 vaccine group; 897 control group. Based on questionnaires on sociodemographics, lifestyle, and reproductive and medical histories with follow-up every 8 weeks during December 2020-September 2021 and followed through November 2021, the study objective was to examine the associations of female and male COVID-19 vaccination with fecundability, the per-cycle probability of conception. The study results showed that COVID-19 vaccination was not appreciably associated with fecundability, with a female Fecundability Rate (FR) of 1.08 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.23) and a male FR=0.95 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.10) in vaccinated individuals [ [Wesselink AK, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwac011) ]. Wang S et al was a comparative cohort study conducted in the United States and Canada. This study aimed to examine the associations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination with menstrual cycle characteristics. Data from 3858 women were analyzed. The results showed an OR of change in cycle length or regularity of 2.00 (95% CI 1,04 to 3,85) [ [Wang S, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2022.07.003) ]. Botton J et al. was a self-controlled case series conducted in France. The study included participants (593 first dose of Ad26.COV2.S; and 9 second dose of Ad26.COV2.S) aged 18 to 74 years hospitalized for pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic stroke, or ischemic stroke between December 27, 2020, and December 20, 2021. This study assessed the short-term risk for severe cardiovascular events after COVID-19 vaccination in France's 46.5 million adults. The primary outcome was hospitalizations for cardiovascular events (Myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or stroke). The RI during the second week after the dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine for Myocardial Infarction was 1.75 (95 % CI, 1.16 - 2.62), 0.42 (95 % CI, 0.13 - 1.32) for Pulmonary Embolism, 1.09 (95 % CI, 0.66 - 1.81) for Ischemic Stroke, and 1.59 (95 % CI, 0.60 - 4.21) for Hemorrhagic Stroke [ [Botton J, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.7326/M22-0988) ].

The frequencies of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) observed among people who received FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (94,818 doses), Moderna (36,350 doses), and Janssen (1,745 doses) were studied and among people who received one of the 10 FDA-approved non-COVID-19 vaccines (771,805 doses). When comparing CVST incidence rates in 30-day time windows before and after vaccination, no statistically significant differences were found for COVID-19 vaccines or any other vaccine studied in this population. In total, 3 cases of CVST were observed within 30 days of vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech (2 female, 1 male; Ages (years): [79, 80, 84]), including one individual with a history of thrombosis and another individual with recent trauma in the past 30 days. No cases of CVST are believed among patients who received Moderna or Janssen vaccines in this study population. Overall, this real-world evidence-based study highlights that TSVC is rare and not significantly associated with the COVID-19 vaccine [ [Pawlowski C, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2021.105923) ].

Hause AM et al. conducted a non-comparative cohort study in the United States, which included 7.98 million doses administered. Five mass vaccination sites reported 64 anxiety-related events, including 17 syncope (fainting) events after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Syncope reporting rates to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) after Janssen COVID-19 and influenza vaccines (2019-20) were 8.2 and 0.05 per 100,000 doses, respectively [ [Hause AM, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7018e3) ]. Shay DK et al. conducted a non-comparative study in the United States, which included 338,765 Janssen vaccine recipients. Recipients of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine completed at least one v-safe survey during the week after vaccination; 76% reported a systemic reaction, 61% reported a local reaction, and 34% reported a health impact. Fatigue and pain were typical symptoms reported in both the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) and v-safe. The overall safety profile is consistent with data from pre-authorization clinical trials. The rapid review of vaccine safety data detected three additional cases of non-cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), in addition to previously recognized CVST cases that initiated the pause in the use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Continuous monitoring of adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, including vaccination with the single-dose Janssen vaccine, is essential to assess the risks and benefits of each vaccine [ [Shay DK, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7018e2) ]. Woo EJ et al. was a non-comparative cohort study conducted in the United States assessing reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome received in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. A total of 130 reports of presumptive Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome were identified in US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination [ [Woo EJ, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.16496) ]. See I et al. was a Non-comparative study conducted in the United States. The study enrolled 57 participants and describes surveillance data and reports rates of all reported Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) cases after COVID-19 vaccination [ [See I, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.7326/M21-4502) ]. Kanack AJ et al. was a non-comparative study conducted in the United States. The study included 9 participants that presented vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)[ [Kanack AJ, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajh.26488) ] Rodr\u00edguez L et al. was a retrospective study conducted in Colombia. In total, 950 women completed the survey, and 408 women met the inclusion criteria of which 184 reported alterations in the menstrual cycle and were included in the study. 51 women reported having Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 53 CoronaVac, 33 Janssen, 15 Moderna and 13 Oxford-AstraZeneca. Of the women who were vaccinated with Janssen, 39 reported normal post-vaccination menstrual frequency, 42% reported normal post-vaccination menstrual regularity, 67% reported normal menstrual duration and 33% reported normal menstrual volume. [ [Rodr\u00edguez Quejada L, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17455057221109375) ]. Scher A et al was a cohort study conducted in United States. This study included 2789 adults who were vaccinated between December 2020 and December 2021 (202 received Janssen vaccine). Severe side effects were most common with the Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson and Johnson) vaccine, followed by mRNA-1273 (Moderna) then BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech). Of the participants who received the Janssen vaccine, 23% had no adverse events, 33% had mild adverse events, 32% had moderate adverse events and 12% had serious adverse events. [ [Scher AI, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac314) ] Nguyen S et al. was a observational, cross-sectional, pharmacovigilance cohort study that examined individual case safety reports from VigiBase\u00ae, the World Health Organization's pharmacovigilance database. The study aimed to identify cases of tranverse myelitis (TM) following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines. The study results showed that 6,921,165 adverse events were reported, with 818 reports correspoding to TM. 41 (8%) of the cases were related to the Janssen vaccine. [ [Nguyen S, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ana.26494) ]. Costa Clemens et al was a phase 4 randomized clinical trial conducted in Brazil. The study included 1205 vaccinated participants: 296 with AstraZeneca Vaccine, 281 with CoronaVac Vaccine, 295 with Janssen Vaccine and 333 with Pfizer Vaccine. The study assessed immunogenicity and safety of a third heterologous booster dose of either AstraZeneca vaccine, Pfizer vaccine, or Janssen vaccine, compared with a third homologous booster dose of CoronaVac in Brazilian adults who had received two doses of CoronaVac 6 months previously. The most common solicited local vaccine reaction in the first seven days was injection site pain, experienced by 60% 46% reported headaches, 10% reported myalgia. Fever and Chills were common for Janssen (12 and 26% respectively). 89256115fcc0240472c559543dd08d433214e977]. Toledo-Salinas et al. conducted a nationwide observational study among recipients of 61,414,803 doses of seven different COVID-19 vaccines, between December 2020 - October 2021 in Mexico, to identify the observed incidence of anaphylaxis in recipients of different anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Unadjusted incidence of anaphylaxis per million doses administered was 0 (95% CI 0) for Ad26.COV2-S. [ [Toledo-Salinas C, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-022-01350-1) ] Garc\u00eda-Grimshaw M was a non-comparative study conducted in Mexico that reported the incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) following COVID-19 vaccination. The study informed the adverse events of 81,842,426 first or second doses of seven COVID-19 vaccines (Coronavac, Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, CanSino, and Janssen), with 1,035,859 doses corresponding to the Janssen vaccine. 97 cases of GBS were identified through passive epidemiological surveillance, 4 of them related to the Janssen vaccination, with an unadjusted incidence of 3.86 (95% CI 1.50-9.93) per million doses administered. [ [Garc\u00eda-Grimshaw M, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.15504) ] Takuva et al was a non-comparative implementation study conducted in South Africa that reported adverse events after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination in healthcare workers, including 477,234 participants between February and May 2021. A total of 10,279 adverse events (AEs) were reported, of which 138 (1.4%) were classified as severe adverse events. Most reported AEs (n = 9,021, 81%) were reactogenicity events; the most common were headaches and body aches that occurred within the first 7 days of vaccination, followed by mild injection site pain and fever. [ [Takuva S, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004024) ] Jacobs JW et al was a surveillance study conducted in the United States that reported autoimmune haemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia following SARS-CoV-2 and non-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including 863 reports between 1990 and 2022. There was 1 case of autoimmune haemolytic anemia and 25 cases of immune thrombocytopenia associated with the Janssen vaccine. [ [Jacobs JW, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.18627) ] Xu S et al was a retrospective cohort study conducted in the United States that reported the non-COVID-19 mortality risk following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including data from 6,974,817 individuals, from seven Vaccine Safety Datalink sites between December 14th 2020 through August 31st 2021. The adjusted hazard ratios after AstraZeneca was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.51-0.59). [ [Xu S, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.12.036) ] Monitoring WHO indicates that after a vaccine is approved for use, regulators conduct robust monitoring of efficacy, as well as monitoring of safety and risk minimization (pharmacovigilance) activities. They need to continually monitor the safety of the vaccine to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks. [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-05-2022-statement-for-healthcare-professionals-how-covid-19-vaccines-are-regulated-for-safety-and-effectiveness) ] Regarding safety surveillance and monitoring, serious adverse events, anaphylaxis and other severe allergic reactions, Bell's palsy, cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, cases of COVID-19 after vaccination resulting in hospitalization or death should be identified and recorded. Regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine, the following should be monitored: Efficacy of the vaccine over time and whether protection can be prolonged with booster doses. Studies to investigate whether this vaccine reduces the transmission and viral spread of SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation and notification of vaccine failures and information on viral sequences. Regarding the subgroups of interest Prospective studies on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant and lactating females. Occasional controlled trials on the safety and security of vaccination in children under 18 years of age.
