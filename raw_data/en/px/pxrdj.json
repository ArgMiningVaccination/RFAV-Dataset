Naturopathy looks at illness as a form of healing, and unlike conventional disease care, naturopathy does not focus on suppressing the symptoms or the body's efforts to rid itself of the cause of the illness. Together we can help your pet regain optimum health through a true, whole health approach designed to address the cause. What I basically do is help to empower you with the tools (knowledge) to make safe, responsible decisions regarding the health of your pets. My philosophies are strictly holistic and are not 'integrative'.
