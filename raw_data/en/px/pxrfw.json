Energy is what allows us to do the things we love with ease, and even gives us the motivation to do things that may seem challenging. Daily life and certain lifestyle habits can cause us to feel run down by the afternoon when there is plenty of time left in the day and still so much to do. If you get adequate rest, exercise during the day, eat a nutritious diet and are still in need of a midday pick-me-up, consider turning to aromatherapy to brighten your spirits. While essential oils are commonly known to exhibit soothing effects, their potent chemical properties can invigorate the senses, improve your mood, awaken your mind, and provide your body with natural energy without jitters or eventual crash. Read on to discover energy-boosting essential oils, and how to best use them to achieve lasting natural energy. HOW TO IDENTIFY LOW ENERGY Feelings of fatigue, lethargy, or lack of energy are normal on occasion. With the demands of careers, family, social circles, and everyday life, you're bound to feel the call to slow down every so often. Lifestyle choices such as poor sleep hygiene, shift work, and jet lag can also contribute to days of experiencing low energy. Symptoms of fatigue include: - Tiredness or sleepiness - Muscle weakness or soreness - Headaches - Dizziness - Reduced responses and reflexes - Difficulty making decisions or judgements - Blurry vision - Difficulty concentrating on tasks - Irritability or moodiness Mildly experiencing the above symptoms is expected after a night of poor sleep or an early morning. However, if these symptoms persist or do not improve with adequate rest, proper nutrition, and regular exercise, it is important for you to see your doctor so that they can help you detect or rule out any underlying health issues. WHY USE AROMATHERAPY TO BOOST ENERGY? For occasional instances of midday sluggishness, aromatherapy and other natural alternatives can provide the surge of energy you need to power through the rest of your day. Sure, you could supply yourself with another cup of coffee. However, forming this habit could lead to a dependence on caffeine, as well as cause jitters and throw cortisol levels out of balance. Consuming too much caffeine throughout the day may also disrupt your sleep at night, since it can take up to 10 hours for caffeine to be completely cleared from the body. With their potent chemical properties, essential oils can support health and wellness in a variety of lifestyles. While many of them are associated with promoting relaxation, energizing essential oils can promote alertness, alleviate grogginess, and revitalize the mind and body as well as exhibit calming properties. Aromatherapy can help balance the nervous system as a reset before inviting new energy into the body. These natural energy boosters are a more sustainable way to get a much-needed pick-me-up that will last through the day without disrupting your eventual wind-down routine and sleep.

HOW TO USE ESSENTIAL OIL TO SUPPORT ENERGY LEVELS Energizing essential oils can be used in a variety of ways to support your energy levels naturally throughout the day. If you have difficulty waking up in the morning, take a few moments to centre yourself after you step out of bed. Instead of jumping right into the hectic energy of the morning, find a place where you won't be disturbed for about five minutes. Sit with your spine straight, practice some deep breathing, and have your choice of energizing essential oil on hand. You can diffuse the oil or place a few drops on a scent strip or cotton ball so you can reap the mental and emotional benefits before starting your day. Throughout your workday, you may find it helpful to keep your essential oil of choice at your desk or in your pocket so you can take a whiff whenever you need. You can also carry a personal inhaler if you wish to blend more than one scent. For symptoms of physical fatigue, topical application of essential oils can help restore areas of the body that are affected by soreness while also working to revitalize your state of mind. Blend your choice of energizing essential oil with a carrier oil (such as Jojoba or Argan) and massage it into your neck, shoulders, or wherever you are experiencing tension throughout the day. If your schedule does not slow down after you walk through the door at the end of the workday, a rejuvenating foot soak can lift your spirits with the natural energy you need to finish the day off strong. Simply fill your bathtub or small plastic bin with warm water and apply 3-5 drops of your chosen essential oil or blend. Be sure to add a dispersant since oil and water do not mix. CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR ESSENTIAL OILS All New Directions Aromatics Essential Oils are for external use only. They should not be ingested and should not be stored within the reach of children, in case of accidental ingestion. As with essential and carrier oils, a patch test should be conducted on the inner arm or another generally insensitive area of skin, using a dime-size amount of the specified oil to check for sensitivities. An absence of an allergic response within 48 hours suggests that the oil is safe to use. The topical application of most carrier oils is generally known to be safe with responsible use, but irritations, allergies, rashes, and other side effects are possible. In the chance of an allergic reaction, discontinue use of the product and see a doctor, pharmacist, or allergist immediately for a health assessment and appropriate remedial action. To prevent side effects, consult with a medical professional prior to use. Essential or carrier oils must never be used near the eyes, inner nose, and ears, or on any other particularly sensitive areas of skin.
