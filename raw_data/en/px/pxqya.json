Traditional Chinsese Medicine Tips on the Liver and Cleansing: Cleansing the body once or twice a year is best done in the spring and in the fall for 10 days up to three months. The liver is your body's main blood filtration organ, and it works hard to make sure that toxins introduced to your body are properly taken care of and excreted. A diet high in alkaline products (lots of fruits and veggies) will naturally reduce the toxic overload. When the liver is harmonious, there never is stress or tension. People with vital livers are calm; they also have unerring judgment and can be naturally effective as leaders and decision-makers. When obstructed, stagnant, or overheated (diet/emotions/drugs) the energy flow in the liver and throughout the body is hampered, resulting in a myriad physical and emotional problems. Some common cleansing herbs and foods are: Chlorophyll rich foods like spirulina/algaes, parsley, kale, rye, romaine lettuces asparagus, milk thistle seeds, Oregon grape root, flowers. Damp heat/cold also known as Candida Albicans is needed to be eradicated and cleansed from the body and intestinal track so we may absorb our nutrients, increase immunity, rehabilitate quickly and have sufficient energy, Join us for our 10 day yoga and fall cleanse!
