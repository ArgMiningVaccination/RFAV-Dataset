Questions and Answers About Intravenous Vitamin C - What is vitamin C? [Vitamin C](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439435&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is a [nutrient](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44697&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that is found in food, such as oranges, grapefruit, kiwi, peppers, and broccoli, and in [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Vitamin C [antioxidant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43997&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and helps [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)damage to [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)caused by [free radicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44030&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It also works with [enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to play a key role in making [collagen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44196&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Vitamin C is also called L-ascorbic acid or ascorbate. - How is vitamin C given or taken? Vitamin C may be given by intravenous (IV) infusion or taken by mouth. When given by IV infusion, vitamin C can reach much higher levels in the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)than when it is taken by mouth. - Have any laboratory or animal studies been done using IV vitamin C? In laboratory studies, [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), tests are done to see if a [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), procedure, or treatment is safe and effective. Laboratory and animal studies are done in animals before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of IV vitamin C. Laboratory studies suggest that high levels of vitamin C may kill [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)cells. For information on laboratory and animal studies done using intravenous vitamin C, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/vitamin-c-pdq#_14)section of the health professional version of Intravenous Vitamin C. - Have any studies of IV vitamin C been done in people with cancer? Several studies of IV vitamin C given alone or in combination with other drugs in people with cancer include the following: Studies of IV vitamin C alone - One study found that people with cancer who received IV vitamin C had better [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and fewer cancer-related [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)than those who did not receive it. - In a single-arm [pilot study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45838&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)of people with [castration-resistant prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=753525&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), IV vitamin C did not lower [prostate-specific antigen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)levels or stop tumors from growing. - In a study of healthy volunteers and people with cancer, vitamin C was shown to be safe at doses up to 1.5 g/kg in people who do not have [kidney](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)stones, other kidney diseases, or [G6PD deficiency](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=748115&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Studies have also shown that vitamin C levels in the blood are higher when given by IV than when taken by mouth, and last for more than 4 hours. Studies of IV vitamin C combined with other drugs Studies of IV vitamin C given with other drugs have shown mixed results. - In a small study of 14 people with [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), IV vitamin C was given along with [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)( [erlotinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=508929&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). Five study participants did not complete the vitamin C treatment because the tumor continued to grow during treatment. The nine participants who completed the treatment had [stable disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45884&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)as shown by [imaging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46361&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)studies. Very few side effects were reported from the vitamin C treatment. - In a study of people newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, IV vitamin C did not interfere with [gemcitabine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=508951&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - In another small study, 9 people with advanced pancreatic cancer were given chemotherapy once a week for 3 weeks along with IV vitamin C twice a week for 4 weeks during each [treatment cycle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=688840&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The cancer did not [progress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45850&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)over an average of 6 months in these patients. No serious side effects were reported with the combined treatment. - In a study of 27 people with advanced [ovarian cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445074&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), chemotherapy alone was compared with chemotherapy and IV vitamin C. IV vitamin C was given during chemotherapy and for 6 months after chemotherapy ended. Those who received IV vitamin C had fewer side effects from the chemotherapy. - People with [refractory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350245&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or metastatic [melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)were treated with IV vitamin C given along with [arsenic trioxide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46018&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and other drugs. The treatment had no anticancer effect, the tumor continued to grow during treatment, and patients had serious side effects. These studies did not have a comparison group, so it is unclear how much the IV vitamin C affected the side effects. - In two pilot trials, people with [non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or [glioblastoma multiforme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45699&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)were given [standard therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)plus IV vitamin C. Those who received standard therapy plus IV vitamin C had better [overall survival](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=655245&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and fewer side effects than the [control groups](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44149&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). More studies of combining IV vitamin C with other drugs are being done. These include a number of [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)combining IV vitamin C with arsenic trioxide, showing mixed results. - One study found that people with cancer who received IV vitamin C had better - Have any side effects or risks been reported from IV vitamin C? IV vitamin C has caused very few side effects in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). However, IV vitamin C may be harmful in people with certain [risk factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - In people with a [history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)of kidney disease, [kidney failure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)has been reported after treatment with IV vitamin C. People who are likely to develop kidney stones should not be treated with IV vitamin C. - One study reported too much [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)in the body (fluid overload) related to IV vitamin C. This may have been caused by the IV delivery method and not the vitamin C. [Case reports](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44007&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)have shown that people with an [inherited](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)disorder called G6PD deficiency should not be given high doses of vitamin C because it may cause [hemolysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=687883&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Because vitamin C may make [iron](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446805&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)more easily absorbed and used by the body, high doses of vitamin C are not recommended for people with [hemochromatosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446804&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(a condition in which the body takes up and stores more iron than it needs). - In people with a - Have any drug interactions been reported from adding IV vitamin C to treatment with anticancer drugs? A [drug interaction](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454754&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is a change in the way a drug acts in the body when taken with certain other drugs. When IV vitamin C is combined with certain anticancer drugs, the anticancer drugs may not work as well. So far, these effects have been seen only in some laboratory and animal studies. For information on drug interactions while using IV vitamin C, see the [Adverse Effects](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/vitamin-c-pdq#_18)section of the health professional version of Intravenous Vitamin C. - Is IV vitamin C approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? FDA has not approved the use of IV vitamin C as a treatment for cancer. FDA does not approve dietary supplements as safe or effective. The company that makes the dietary supplements is responsible for making sure they are safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. The way that supplements are made is not regulated by FDA, so all batches and brands of IV vitamin C may not be the same. About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of intravenous vitamin C in the treatment of people with cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam). Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials).

General CAM Information Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)\u2014also called integrative medicine\u2014includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. Evaluation of CAM Therapies It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment\u2014not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. [The NCI Best Case Series Program](https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm) which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: - What side effects can be expected? - What are the risks related to this therapy? - What benefits can be expected from this therapy? - Do the known benefits outweigh the risks? - Will the therapy affect conventional treatment? - Is this therapy part of a clinical trial? - If so, who is the sponsor of the trial? - Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?
