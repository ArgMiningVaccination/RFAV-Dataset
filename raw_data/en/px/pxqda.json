Viruses ; 24. | MEDLINE | respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]( [SARS-CoV-2]), also known as COVID-19, is currently developing into a rapidly disseminating and an overwhelming worldwide [pandemic]. In severe COVID-19 cases, [hypercoagulability]and [inflammation]are two crucial [complications]responsible for poor [prognosis]and [mortality]. In coagulation system activation [life]-threatening [complications], including coagulopathy and [cytokine storm], which are associated with overproduction of [cytokines]and activation of the [immune system]; they might be a [lead]cause of organ damage. However, [patients]with severe COVID-19 [who]received [anticoagulant] [therapy]had lower [mortality], especially with elevated D-dimer or [fibrin degradation products](FDP). In this regard, the discovery of [natural products]with [anticoagulant]potential may help mitigate the numerous side effects the available [synthetic drugs]. This [review]sheds [light]on [blood coagulation]and its impact on the complication associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, the sources of natural [anticoagulants], the [role]of [nanoparticle]formulation in this [thrombocytopenia] [syndrome](TTS) after [COVID-19 vaccines]are also reviewed. These combined data provide many [research]ideas related to the possibility of using these [anticoagulant agents]as a [treatment]to relieve acute symptoms of COVID-19 [infection].
