Updated COVID-19 boosters are now available to students, faculty, staff and their dependents ages 12 and up at the [University Health Center Pharmacy](https://health.unl.edu/pharmacy). How to Get Vaccinated To get vaccinated, you must schedule an appointment with the pharmacy by calling [402.472.7457](tel:+14024727457) Parental permission is required for minors to receive their vaccination. If you are 18, bring a completed Power of Attorney form with you; if you have a form on file with the health center, you do not need to bring another copy. The pharmacy is unable to call a parent or legal guardian for consent to vaccinate. There are also many community resources that offer vaccination opportunities. People ages 5 and older qualify for COVID-19 vaccination through their county health department. If you live in Lancaster county, schedule through [https://vaccinate.ne.gov](https://vaccinate.ne.gov/). If you are a student, faculty or staff member with children under 19, please know that parental consent is required. Please check with your county to see how they are handling the parental consent process. You can also schedule a COVID-19 vaccination through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program.

Studies show that after getting vaccinated against COVID-19, protection against the virus may decrease over time and be less able to protect against the Delta variant. Who is eligible? The following are eligible to receive a COVID-19 booster: - People who received a Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months ago - People who received a two-dose Pfizer or Moderna series at least six months ago and fall into any of these eligible groups: - 65 years and older - Age 18+ who live in long-term care settings - Age 18+ who have underlying medical conditions - Age 18+ who work or live in high-risk settings - Immunocompromised people who received their single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the second shot of their Pfizer or Moderna series at least 28 days ago What does it cost? The booster doses are free of charge to anyone who meets the eligibility criteria. Where can I get my booster? The University Health Center Pharmacy offers the bivalent COVID-19 booster. You can also find off-campus locations that offer the booster by searching vaccines.gov, texting your ZIP code to 438829 or calling 1-800-232-0233. Do I have to get the same vaccine as my original type? You may choose which vaccine you receive as a booster dose. Some people may have a preference for the vaccine type they originally received. Others may prefer to get a different booster. The CDC allows this type of mix and match dosing for booster shots. Does this change who is considered fully vaccinated? The definition of fully vaccinated has not changed. If you have completed your two-dose Pfizer or Moderna series or the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you are still considered fully vaccinated. [Learn more about COVID-19 booster shots by visiting the CDC website.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html) Common Questions How can I get a copy of my vaccination card? If you've already been vaccinated, you should have received a COVID-19 vaccination card at the time of your initial immunization. If you lose your card, you can also access your Nebraska vaccination records through the [Nebraska State Immunization Information System (NESIIS)](https://nesiis-dhhs-prod.ne.gov/prd_ir/public/clientSearch.do?language=en). You can also call the Information Line, 402.444.3400, available 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday. If you are having trouble accessing your vaccination records through NESIIS, please consult your vaccine provider for assistance. NESIIS also has a Help Line at 888.433.2510 or can be reached by email at dhhs.nesiis@nebraska.gov (Note -- If you were vaccinated outside of Nebraska, you'll need to contact that state or vaccine provider). How much does the vaccine cost? The COVID-19 vaccine is free to most citizens. Vaccine distributors can charge an administration fee for giving the shot to someone. However, in most cases, public and private insurance providers cover this cost. We are not billing patients for COVID-19 vaccines received at Nebraska Medicine locations, including the University Health Center, and we do not profit from COVID-19 vaccinations. Why do we need COVID-19 vaccines? COVID-19 infections can be a minor inconvenience, or they can lead to severe disease and death. Social distancing, handwashing and wearing your mask certainly help. However, the best way to stop this virus is to generate COVID-19-specific immunity within our community. We can achieve this immunity in one of two ways: through illness (natural herd immunity) or through vaccination. Since illness leads to severe disease or death for many, a safe and effective vaccine is a much better alternative.

Are the vaccines safe and effective? If I am young and healthy, why should I get the vaccine? If vaccines don't stop every case of COVID-19, what's the point? Are the vaccines safe even though they don't have full FDA approval? Why are masks still important for unvaccinated people? What do we know about long-term side effects of the vaccine? Is Myocarditis a possible side effect of the vaccine? Vaccine Education Safety Information Learn about the vaccine's ingredients, emergency use authorization and special considerations for different populations. Side Effects Understand the side effects for each of the vaccines and learn about potential allergic reactions. Frequently Asked Questions Get answers to common COVID vaccine questions.
