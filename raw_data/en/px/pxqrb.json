If you're ready to take the first step in cleaning up your diet or want to consider food as medicine for a disease, we can guide you with knowledge. Working with a certified integrative nutritionist in the Sutter Health network, you'll discover practical and enjoyable ways of eating delicious foods. We also provide customized advice about menu plans and nutritional supplements. Your initial consult starts with personalized testing and assessments, including measuring body fat, muscle tissue, extra-cellular mass, cell membrane health, and hydration, plus in-depth questions about your lifestyle and concerns. In follow-up visits, you'll receive a nutrition blueprint and coaching to achieve your goals. Nutritional support can be targeted for specific medical conditions.
