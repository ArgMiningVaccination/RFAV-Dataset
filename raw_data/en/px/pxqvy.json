An adverse event can be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicine, whether considered related to the medicine, or not. 1.3 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) or Adverse Reaction \"Adverse drug reaction\" or \"adverse reaction\" means a response to a medicine in humans which is noxious and unintended, including lack of efficacy, and which occurs at doses normally used in man and which can also result from overdose, misuse or abuse of a medicine. The definition of an adverse drug reaction or adverse reaction applies to registered medicines, medicines for which the HCR holds an application for registr ation (\"Old Medicines\"). Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicine and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. An adverse reaction includes adverse clinical consequences associated with the use of a medicine outside the terms of the approved professional information/ applicable product information or other conditions laid down for the marketing and use of the product (including prescribed doses higher than those recommended, overdoses or abuse). A reaction, contrary to an event (as in 3.2), is characterised by the occurrence of a suspected causal relationship between the drug and the reaction, as determined by the reporter or a reviewing healthcare professional / provider. The fact that the healthcare professional / provider is making a report to a holder of a certificate of registration, serves as an indication that the observed event may be caused by the medicine. All spontaneous reports are, therefore, suspected adverse drug reactions. In the case of pre- and post -marketing studies, adverse \"events\" are usually systematically solicited. In cases where there is uncertainty as to whether or not an event is a reaction, it is better to treat the event as a reaction. For the purpose of post -marketing clinical trials, an adverse drug reaction includes any adverse event where the contribution of the study medication, concomitant medication or other medicinal intervention of the clinical trial, cannot be ruled out. 1.4 Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI s) An AEFI is defined as any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunisation; does not necessarily SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 5 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine; may be any unfavourable symptom about which a vaccine recipient complains; and may be an abnormal laboratory finding, sign or disease found by medical staff. 1.5 Consumer A consumer in relation to healthcare, means a person who uses or is a potential user of health services, as well as their family and caregiver; for example, a patient, lawyer, friend, relative or carer of a patient. 1.6 Healthcare Professional / Provider For the purposes of reporting suspected adverse reactions, \"healthcare professionals / providers\" are medical practitioners, pathologists, dentists, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals including allied healthcare professionals and practitioners. When reports originate from pharmacists or nurses, further information about the case should, where possible, be sought from a medical practitioner responsible for the patient. Furthermore, if there is more than one reporter, the healthcare professional / provider directly involved with the patient's care and who provides the most complete and clinically relevant information, will be considered the primary reporter. 1.7 Holder of a C ertificate of a Registration (HCR) An entity or a person in whose name a registration certificate has been granted for manufacturing, distribution, exportation and importation of medicines and who is responsible for all aspects of the medicine, including quality and safety and compliance with conditions of registration. 1.8 Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) An individual case safety report (ICSR) is a detailed record of all relevant data associated with the use of a medicine in a subject or patient. 1.9 Line Listings A line listing provides key information but not necessarily all the details customarily collected on individual cases. Reactions are classified by body system for the most serious-presenting sign or symptom according to Standard MedDRA Queries (SMQ). The headings usually included are: country of occurrence (if relevant); source (e.g. spontaneous, clinical trial, literature, regulatory authority); age; gender; dose(s) of suspected medicine(s) the diagnosis being treated by the suspect medicine; dosage form an d/or route of administration, batch number when applicable; duration of treatment (prior to event) time to onset; description of reaction (as reported); patient outcome (e.g. fatal, resolved, etc.); and In some instances, depending on the type or source, ADR/AEFI reports should be presented as line listings. A line listing serves to help the Authority to identify cases that it might wish to examine more completely by requesting full case reports. 1.10 Medication error SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 6 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 A medication error is an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to cause or lead to harm to the patient, regardless of whether the error is associated with adverse reaction(s) or not. This exclude intentional overdose, intentional pres cribing error (that results in sub- therapeutic dose), off -label use, misuse and abuse. A failure in the drug treatment process does not refer to lack of efficacy of the drug, rather to human or process mediated failures. 1.11 Lack of efficacy \"Lack of efficacy\" is defined as failure to produce the expected pharmacological action. Lack of efficacy applies to registered medicines, including when used for an unapproved indication. 1.12 Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSUR) / Periodic Benefit -Risk Evaluation Reports (PBRER) A periodic safety update report (PSUR) or a Periodic Benefit -Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) is an update of the world -wide safety experience of a medicine at defined times post -registration, as determined from the international birth date. Each safety update report should cover the period of time since the last update report. The PSUR or PBRER should be compiled in accordance with the requirements of the current ICH E2C Expert Group on Clinical Safety Data Management: Periodic Safety Update Repor ts for Marketed Drugs. 1.13 Reportable Adverse Reaction - Minimum Information A reportable ADR/AEFI requires the following minimum information: an identifiable source (reporter) of the information. This should include the name or initials and address of the reporter and the reporter's qualification (e.g. doctor, dentist, pharmacist, nurse or lay person); an identifiable patient. A patient may be identified by surname and forename(s) or initials of surname and forenames, or by a reference number, or by age or gender; suspected medicine(s)/vaccine (s); and suspected reaction(s). Information, additional to the minimum, should be actively sought and submitted as soon as it becomes available. 1.14 Risk-Benefit Balance Evaluation An evaluation of the positive therapeutic effects of the medicine in relation to the risks (any risk relating to the quality, safety or efficacy of the medicine as regards patients' health or public health). 1.15 Serious Adverse Drug Event or Adverse Drug Reaction or Adverse Events Following Immunisation A serious adverse event/experience or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life -threatening; requires patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or is a medically significant / important event or reaction. The term \"life -threatening\" in the definition of \"serious\" refers to a reaction/event in which the patient was SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 7 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 at risk of death at the time of the reaction/event; it does not refer to an event which, hypothetically, might have caused death if it were more severe. Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised when deciding whether other situations are serious or not. Such instances could include medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation, but which may jeopardise the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples include blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in hospitalisation, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The term \"severe\" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event. This is not the same as \"serious', which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria. 1.16 Significant safety issue A significant safety issue is a new safety is sue or validated signal considered by the applicant/ HCR in relation to their medicines that requires urgent attention of the Authority. This may be because of the seriousness and potential major impact on the benefit -risk balance of the medicine and/or on patient or public health, which could warrant prompt regulatory action and / or communication to patients and healthcare professionals / providers. The applicant/ HCR can identify significant safety issues as a result of ongoing review and analysis of all information that is pertinent to the safety and benefit -risk balance of the medicine. A safety issue leading to international regulatory action is considered to be significant at all times and hence reportable. 1.17 Spontaneous Report or Notification A spontaneous report is a communication to a company, regulatory authority or other organisation that describes a suspected ADR/AEFI in a patient given one or more medicines, and which does not derive from a study. 1.18 Solicited Reports Solicited reports are defined as those derived from organised data collection systems, which include clinical trials, registries, post -approval named patient programmes, other patient support and disease management programmes, surveys of patients or health care providers, or information gathering on efficacy or patient adherence. For the purpose of safety reporting, solicited reports should be classified as an ICSR . 1.19 Unexpected (unlisted) Adverse Drug Reaction/Adverse Events Following Immunisation For the pu rposes of this guideline, an \"unexpected\" adverse reaction is one in which the nature, specificity, severity and outcome is not consistent with the approved professional information for a registered medicine. An unexpected reaction includes class -related r eactions which are mentioned in the applicable medicine information but which are not specifically described as occurring with a medicine. When the outcome of the adverse reaction is not consistent with the applicable medicine information the adverse react ion should be considered as unexpected. An expected ADR/AEFI with a fatal outcome should be considered unexpected unless the South African labelling specifically states that the ADR/AEFI might be associated with a fatal outcome. 1.20 SAHPRA Refers to the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, hereafter referred to as the Authority . SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 8 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 2 INTRODUCTION Reporting of ADRs/AEFIs and monitoring thereof, is a viable means of identifying previously unrecognised, rare or serious ADRs/AEFIs. Every applicant/ HCR is required to report to the Authority, ADRs/AEFIs known to them involving their marketed medicines in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 40 of the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 101 of 1965, as amended . The success of the Authority's ADR/AEFI reporting system depends on the quality, completeness, and accuracy of the information submitted. The Authority make decisions and take regulato ry actions such as updating a Professional Information and Patient Info rmation Leaflet, restricting the use of a product in certain population and withdrawal of a product from the South African market, therefore contributing to international data regarding risks and effectiveness of medicines, and imparting health product saf ety knowledge that benefits all South Africans. 3 SCOPE This guidance document covers the collection of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFIs) and product quality issues by SAHPRA for the following registered and marketed health products: Medicines for use by humans, including biological medicines and vaccines (Category A) Complementary medicines for use by humans (Category D). Radiopharmaceuticals, including radionuclides. This guideline does not apply to the reporting of ADRs/AEFIs and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) related to unregistered medicines; obtained via section 21 of the Medicines and Related Substances Control Act; used in the context of pre -registration Phase 1, 2 or 3 clinical trials, active pharma ceutical ingredients used in compounded medicines (Category B) and registered and marketed veterinary medicines (Category C). 4 PURPOSE This guideline is intended to assist applicants/HCRs in the reporting of ADRs/AEFIs associated with the use of registered medicines and \"Old Medicines\" and in the management of safety data which may arise during post -registration, including during Phase 4 post -marketing clinical trials. 5 LEGAL BACKGROUND In accordance with Regulation 40 issued in terms of the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 101 of 1965, as amended. (1) A person who has applied for registration of a medicine in terms of section 15 of the Act, a holder of a certificate of registration in re spect of a medicine or Scheduled substance, or a holder of a licence in terms of section 22C (1) (b) must inform the Authority, in the manner and within the time frame as determined by the Authority. A holder of certificate of registration (HCR)/applicant and licence holder must inform the Authority of any: (a) new or existing quality, safety or effectiveness concerns related to any medicine or scheduled substance, including but not limited to adverse drug reactions; and (b) risk management activities associated with paragraph (1) (2) A person who has applied for registration of a medicine in terms of section 15 of the Act, a holder of a certificate of registration in respect of a medicine or Scheduled substance, or a holder of a licence in SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 9 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 terms of section 22C (1) (b) must maintain or have access to records of the reports and case reports referred to in sub regulation (1) above . 6 PHARMACOVIGILANCE OBLIGATIONS OF THE APPLICANT/ HOLDER OF A CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION 6.1 The Role and Responsibilities of the applicant/ Holder of a Certificate of Registration In order to comply with the regulatory pharmacovigilance requirements, the applicants/HCRs should: (i) establish and operate a pharmacovigilance system to ensure monitoring and supervision of their medicines registered/marketed in South Africa; including the following critical pharmacovigilance processes: collection, processing, management, quality control, follow -up for missing information, coding, classification, duplicate detection, evaluation and timely electronic transmission of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) from any source; signal management ; continuous safety profile monitoring and benefit -risk evaluation of registered medicines; establishing, assessing and implementing risk management systems and evaluating the effectiveness of risk minimisation; scheduling, preparation (including data ev aluation and quality control), submission and assessment of periodic safety update reports/ Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report; meeting commitments and responding to requests from the Authority timeously, including provision of correct and complete i nformation; (ii) have an appropriately Qualified Persons Responsible for Pharmacovigilance to be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the pharmacovigilance system (refer to the QPPV); (iii) establis h and use a quality system that is adequate and effective for performing its pharmacovigilance activities; (iv) ensure that there is full documentation covering all procedures and activities of the QPPV/ local pharmacovigilance officer and that mechanisms are i n place to ensure that the QPPV/ local pharmacovigilance officer may receive or seek all relevant information. 6.2 The Role and Responsibilities of the applicant/ Holder of a Certificate Registration's QPPV/ local PV Officer of the applicant/ HCR's QPPV/local Pharmacovigilance Office r include: (i) the establishment and maintenance of a system which ensures that information about all suspected adverse reactions / adverse event following immunisation, which are report ed to the applicant/ HCR , including to medical representatives and clinical research associates, is collected and collated so that it is accessible at a single point; (ii) serving as a contact person for the Authority in all matters relating to pharmacovigilance; SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 10 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 (iii) the preparation of the following, either directly or by delegation/supervision, for submission to the Authority: ADR /AEFI reports; Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) or Periodic Benefit -Risk Evaluation Repor ts (PBRER) (including a national appendix relevant to South Africa ), when requested; company -sponsored post -registration study reports, when required; and ongoing pharmacovigilance evaluation during the post -registration period; and (iv) ensuring that any request from the Authority for additional information deemed necessary for the evaluation of the risk- benefit ratio of a medicine, is provided to the Authority promptly and in accordance with all requirements, (v) ensure that all the above responsibilities are met for old and registered medicines that are marketed in South Africa. For products that are no longer marketed, post marketing surveillance and reporting of ADRs /AEFIs should continue until six months after the expiry date of the last marketed batch. 6.3 Back -up procedures Back-up procedures in the case of absence of the QPPV/local Pharmacovigilance Officer should be in place and should be accessible through the QPPV/ local Pharmacovigilance Officer's contact details. The QPPV/local Pharmacovigilance Offic er should ensure that the back -up person has all necessary information to fulfil the role. The Back -up QPPV/ local Pharmacovigilance Officer shall meet all the requirements of a QPPV/local Pharmacovigilance Officer. The Back -up QPPV/ local Pharmacovigilanc e Officer shall however receive training in pharmacovigilance appropriate for his/her roles. In addition to the above the QPPV/local Pharmacovigilance Officer and the Back- up QPPV/local Pharmacovigilance Officer should reside in South Africa and have know ledge on applicable South African safety monitoring legislation and guidelines and international standards for Pharmacovigilance and also demonstrate (e.g. through qualifications and training) that he/she has knowledge of the key pharmacovigilance activiti es performed as part of the applicant/HCR's pharmacovigilance system and how to implement them. 6.4 Contractual Arrangements Applicants/HCRs may subcontract certain activities of the pharmacovigilance system to third parties organisation (where the same requi rements apply). This may include the role of the QPPV/local Pharmacovigilance Officer (refer QPPV). The applicant/HCR shall nevertheless retain full responsibility for: the fulfilment of all pharmaco vigilance tasks and responsibilities and the quality and integrity of the pharmacovigilance system. ensuring that an effective quality system is applied in relation to the subcontracted tasks. 7 REPORTING TIMEFRAMES FOR ALL ADVERSE DRUG REACTION / ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOWING IMMUNISATION In order to report ADRs /AEFIs in accordance with the regulations, it is sufficient that each applicant/ HCR report to the Authority the following domestic (South African) cases as stipulated below: SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 11 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 7.1 Time frames for ADRs /AEFIs occurring in South Africa (i) All serious suspected ADRs /AEFIs , related or unrelated; and expected or unexpected , occurring in South Africa with any old or registered medicine, must be reported by the applicant/ HCR to the Authority withi n fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of such information. (ii) All non-serious, expected and unexpected, suspected adverse drug react ions / adverse event following immunisation, occurring in South Africa with any old or registered medicine, should not be routinely reported to the Authority. However, they must be presented as a line listing/summary tabulation (cumulative table) in a PSUR and submitted to the Authority when requested as stipulated under 5 .3. (iii) The reporting time clock (Day 0) for submission of serious ADRs/AEFIs starts on the day that the four minimum data elements (see 3.13 ) (Day 0) in relation to the ADR /AEFI report are received by any of the applicant/ HCR 's personnel, including sales representatives and contractors. Where the applicant/ HCR has entered into a r elationship with another company for the marketing of, or research on the suspected medicines, Day 0 is as soon as any personnel of the applicant/ HCR receives the four minimum data elements. The timeframe for regulatory submission should be no longer than fifteen (15) days from the first receipt of the four minimum data elements by the applicant/ HCR . (iv) The reporting time clock for follow -up information restarts when the applicant/ HCR receive additional clinical or medically relevant information for previously reported serious ADR s/AEFIs . This information must be reported as soon as possible and no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the applicant/ HCR receive the additional information. (v) Significant safety issues impacting on the risk -benefit profile of a product (including changes in nature, severity or frequency of risk factors) , must be reported by the applicant/ HCR within five (5) calendar days of receipt or identification of such information. The applicant/ HCR must provide detailed informat ion of the safety information and where possible provide sources of such information. 7.2 Time frames for reactions occurring outside South Africa (i) Foreign individual case reports should not be forwarded to the Authority on a routine basis, but should be reported in the context of a significant safety issue or in response to a specific request by the Authority. (ii) The applicant/ HCR should advise the Authority of any \"Significant Safet y Issue\"(as defined in section 3 .16) that has been taken by any medicines regulatory agency/authority in another country, including the basis for such action, within 5 calendar days of first local knowledge of such action. 7.3 Periodic Safety Update Reports/ Periodic Benefit -Risk Evaluation Rep orts (i) PSURs or PBRERs should be compiled in accordance with the requirements of the current ICH E2C Expert Group on Clinical Safety Data Management: Periodic Safety Update Reports for Marketed Drugs. A PSUR/PBRER must reflect new and cumulative information available to the applicant/ HCR . (ii) The Authority may prescribe the frequency at which PSURs/PBRERs should be prepared and submitted as a condition of registration, or may prescribe the frequency in response to a safety signal. (iii) In the absence of a specific frequency prescribed by the Authority, applicants/HCRs should refer SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 12 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 to the European Union Reference Dates (EURD) list to determine the frequency of and target dates for the preparation of the PSUR/PBRER for each registered medicine. For medicines which do not appear in the EURD list, and for which the Authority has not prescribed otherwise, applicants/HCRs should prepare a PSUR/PBRER annually. (iv) In addition to the PSUR/PBRER, the applicant/ HCR should prepare a national appendix relevant to South Africa on an annual basis. This national appendix should include the following : Patient exposure in SA ADRs /AEFIs reported in SA (in a line listing format as stipulated in 3.9) Approved local professional information (v) The PSUR/PBRER and national appendix should be reviewed by the applicant/ HCR , and should be kept by the applicant/ HCR , to be ready for submission to th e Authority upon request. (vi) PSURs/PBRERs, together with the national appendix, should only be submitted to the Authority in the following situations: Whenever requested by the Authority. When the submission of PSURs/PBRERs is a condition of registration for a new medicine or range of medicines. As part of a submission to amend the conditions of registration when the PSUR/PBRER contains information supporting the amendment. (vii) When requested by the Authority, PSURs/PBRERs must be submitted within 30 calendar da ys of the request. When submitted as a condition of registration, PSURs/PBRERs must be submitted within 30 calendar days of initial receipt from the parent company. The version of the PSUR/PBRER and national appendix submitted to the Authority should alway s be the most recent. If the PSUR/PBRER is for more than a year, the national appendix should also be for the cumulative years as per the PSUR/PBRER. (viii) The applicant/ HCR should inform the Authority of any steps which are being taken, or to be taken, with reg ard to safety concerns raised in the PSUR/PBRER at the time of the submission. 7.4 South African Case Reports from Published Scientific Literature (i) Applicants/ HCRs should, through screening of the worldwide literature (via search tools e.g. PubMed), report published accounts of serious suspected ADRs /AEFIs occurring in South Africa , related to the active substance(s) of their medicines . A copy of the relevant scientific publication should always be provided. (ii) An ADR /AEFI report should be completed for each identifiable patient (with an identifiable ADR /AEFI ). For instance, if an article describes six identifiable patients with a given adverse experience, six ADR /AEFI reports should be submitted to the Authority. (iii) If more than one medicine is mentioned in the literature report, only the applicant/ HCR whose medicine is suspected of being the cause is required to submit a report. The suspect medicine is usually the one stated as such in the body or title of the articl e by the author(s). All concomitant medicines reported in the article should be included in the report, whether belonging to the applicant of the suspect drug or not. (iv) If the source of the medicine and/or the proprietary name is not specified and ownership of the product cannot be excluded on the basis of the active substance(s), dosage form or route of administration and marketing status of the product (refer to 4 .2.v), the applicant/ HCR should assume that it is one of their medicines the publication refers to, although the report should indicate that the specific medicine source and/or the proprietary name was not identified. (v) If the literature report is of a generalised nature with no identifiable patient, it should not be SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 13 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 submitted as an individual case report. However, if the report identifies a safety concern this should be communicated to the Authority and include an opinion on the issue prepared on behalf of the applicant/ HCR . 7.5 Reports from Post -Registration Studies (i) All suspected serious adverse drug reactions or adverse events following immunisation from Phase 4 post -registration studies taking place in South Africa must be reported according to 5.1 above. This applies to reports from any type of clinical or epidemiological investigation, regardless of design or purpose, involving a medicine. (ii) Investigators involve d in post -registration studies should be aware of the definition of what constitutes a serious adverse drug reaction, as well as the distinction between 'reactions' and 'events'. (iii) In the case of post -registration studies, adverse \"events\" are usually system atically solicited. In cases where there is uncertainty as to whether or not an event is a reaction, the case should be reported as an adverse reaction. Events that are clearly unrelated to the medicine should not be reported. (iv) If the manufacturer receives a report of a serious adverse drug reaction from the investigator who is blinded to individual patient treatment, the guidelines outlined in section (v) below should be adhered to. (v) Managing blinded therapy cases: When a serious, unexpected, suspected adver se reaction occurs which results in death or, which is life-threatening, and is, therefore, judged reportable on an expedited (rapid) basis, it is recommended that the blind be broken only for that specific patient by the sponsor, even if the investigator has not broken the blind. It is also recommended that, when possible and appropriate, the blind be maintained for those persons responsible for analysis and interpretation of results at the study's conclusion. By retaining the blind, placebo and comparator (usually a marketed medicine) cases are filed in the database unnecessarily. (vi) When a fatal or other serious outcome is the primary efficacy endpoint in a clinical trial, the integrity of the clinical trial may be compromised if the blind is broken. Under t hese and similar circumstances, agreement should be reached in advance with the Authority concerning serious events that would be treated as disease -related and not subject to expedited reporting. An independent data safety monitoring board should be estab lished prior to commencement of the trial, and its composition and terms of reference, should be submitted with the clinical trial application documents to the Authority for evaluation. 7.6 On-Going Pharmacovigilance Evaluation It should be noted that the requirements for on-going Pharmacovigilance Evaluation as described in this section takes precedence over other cumulative ADR /AEFI reporting requirements mentioned in this guideline. (i) Applicants/ HCRs must inform the Authority, whenever new evidence becomes available including any change in the nature, severity or frequency of expected ADRs /AEFIs or any new risk factors, (nationally and internationally) that could significantly impact on the benefit/risk assessment of a medicine or which would be suff icient to consider changes to the conditions of registration of the medicine. Applicants/ HCRs must inform the Authority within five (5) calendar days of first knowledge of such information. The basis on which these assessments are made should be included. (ii) Additional pharmacovigilance data, such as actual case reports, drug usage figures, the regulatory SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 14 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 status of the medicine in other countries, independent pharmaco -epidemiology studies, pre- clinical studies or significant product quality data may be requested by the Authority as the situation warrants. This will be requested for submission within a time period specified by the Authority . 7.7 Consumer Reports If an applicant/ HCR receives an adverse drug reaction /adverse event following immunisation report from a consumer, the applicant/ HCR should advise the consumer to report this reaction through his/her healthcare professional / provider. If this approach fails, the applicant/ HCR should attempt to obtain as much information as possible from the consumer, including medical documentation. If the minimum four data elements for reporting (see 3.13 ) have been met, and the report is deemed to be relevant by a healthcare professional / provider within the company, the case is considered reportable, in line with 5 .1 (i) and (ii). 7.8 Reports relating to pregnancy and breastfeeding The applicant/ HCR must report suspected adverse drug reactions /adverse event following immunisation related to pregnancy or breastfeeding as specified in 5 .1.and 5.2 above, regardless of whether the drug is contra -indicated in pregnancy and/or lactation. Reports on pregnancy sho uld not be forwarded before the outcome is known, unless unintended pregnancy is suspected as an adverse drug reaction /adverse event following immunisation. Reports on pregnancy should not be submitted if there is no adverse effect to the foetus/infant. Reports of termination of pregnancy without information on congenital malformation should not routinely be reported. 7.9 Teratogenicity and Congenital Anomalies For reports on congenital anomalies or teratogenicity, the following information should be provided: (i) Age and sex of the infant (ii) the birth date or the date on which pregnancy was terminated (iii) date and/or duration of in utero exposure where possible (iv) any adverse reaction experienced by the mother must be considered a new initial case report on a separate report form. 7.10 Reports of lack of efficacy Lack of efficacy with medicines (e.g. antimicrobial agents, vaccines or contraceptives or other classes of medicines) used for the treatment of life -threatening diseases /conditions , where lack of efficacy could result in serious consequences, should be reported according to 5 .1(i). Lack of efficacy applies to registered medicines, including when used for an unapproved indication. Normal progression of disease does not imply lack of efficacy. The applicant/ HCR should use clinical judgement to consider whether a case qualifies as serio us for reporting purposes. The lot number of the suspected medicine for a report of lack of efficacy must be included in the report. 7.11 Overdose Suspected serious adverse reactions associated with an overdose should be reported according to 5 .1(i) / (ii). T his should include reports, which indicate that taking of the suspect medicine led to suicidal intention and subsequent overdose of the suspect medicine, or of other medication(s). SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 15 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 7.12 Off-label use / misuse / abuse / occupational exposure Reports of off-label use / misuse / abuse / occupational exposure should be submitted when the off -label use / misuse / abuse / occupational exposure was associated with an adverse reaction. An additional ADR /AEFI term that is reflective of the off -label use / misuse / abuse / occupational exposure should be included on the ICSR. 7.13 Medication Errors All medication errors should be reported to the Authority within 15 calendar days , whether serious or non - serious, expected or unexpected, suspected ADRs /AEFIs has occurred or not . 7.14 Medicine Defects If an adverse event is suspected to be related to a medicine defect, it should be reported in the same manner as a suspected adverse reaction. The lot number of the suspected medi cines must be included in the report. Applicant/ HCRs should inform the Authority whether the implicated products have been tested for quality attributes and what, if any, corrective actions are being or have been taken. 7.15 Interactions If an adverse event is suspected to be related to an interaction between two or more medicines, it should be reported as an adverse reaction in the prescribed manner. 7.16 Adverse Reaction Reports from the Internet Applicants/ HCRs should regularly screen websites and social media a ccounts under their management or responsibility for potential ADR /AEFI case reports. The frequency of the screening should allow for potential valid ADRs/AEFIs to be reported to the Authority within the appropriate timeframe, based on the date the informa tion was posted. Unsolicited cases from the Internet should be handles as spontaneous reports. For determination of reportability, the same criteria should be applied as for cases provided via other means. In relation to such cases from the Internet, ident ifiability of the reporter refers to the existence of a natural person, i.e. it should be possible to verify that the patient and reporter exist (e.g. a valid e -mail address has been provided). Contact details should only be used for pharmacovigilance purp oses. 7.17 Period after Suspension, Cancellation or Withdrawal of Holder of Certificate of Registration The applicant/ HCR should continue to collect ADR/AEFI reports related to the concerned medicine and continue to report if information becomes available, even after suspension, cancellation or withdrawal of registration or \"Old Medicine\" status until six months after the last marketed batch expiry. After this date, the applicant/ HCR should report any new follow -up information on the reported cases and continue to collect (but not report) safety information the applicant/ HCR is made aware of for review of delayed onset adverse reactions or retrospectively notif ied cases. SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 16 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 8 PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING 8.1 To Whom to Report All reports required by these guidelines should be sent to the Authority, through channels stipulated under 7. 8.2 Route of Notification Reportable Safety Information as reflected in the Guidelines associated with registered human medicines must be sent to the Authority email through channels stipulated in 7. 8.3 Report Format and Details (i) Reporting can be done using the adverse reaction report form available from the SAHPRA website and SAHPRA offices or the applicants/HCRs may use their in-house reporting forms (including the Council for International Organisations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) I format) provided all the minimum data elements (see 3.13 ) are included on the form in a readable format, which include an identifiable reporter , an identi fiable patient, a suspect product and an adverse reaction. (ii) Reports can also be submitted to the Authority in the e2b format using an xml file. (iii) Applicants/ HCRs should submit ALL the relevant information available at the time of initial notification of an adverse drug reaction report, not only the minimum information required for a report. The attachment of discharge summaries, post -mortem reports, relevant laboratory data and other additional clinical data, is encouraged. (iv) The original words/description (verbatim) used by the initial reporter to describe the adverse reaction should be provided. The medicine name as reported by the initial reporter must be provided, preferably the proprietary name. (v) Additional information, not ava ilable at the time of the initial report, should be provided in the form of follow-up reports. (vi) The applicant/ HCR is required to submit the name or initials, address and telephone number and qualification of the initial reporter on the adverse drug reaction report form. In order to ensure confidentiality, the initials of the reporter may be used. The full reporter information should be disclosed to the Authority upon request. 8.4 Follow -Up Reports Any follow-up information from the applicant/ HCR relating to an initial ADR /AEFI report submitted to the Authority, must be cross -referenced to the unique number assigned by the applicant/ HCR . A CIOMS format \"initial\" report which follows a previous (first ) communication from the applicant/ HCR must be clearly marked that it is a follow up and linked through the applicant/ HCR -assigned reference number. This is the only reliable way to minimise the duplication of reports, submitted by applicant/ HCRs , in the A uthority's database. 8.5 Another Holder of a Certificate of Registration's Medicine Spontaneous reports: If an applicant/ HCR receives a report of a suspected adverse reaction to a medicine marketed by another applicant/ HCR , the report should promptly be forwarded to the applicant/ HCR of that medicine. The applicant/ HCR to whom the event was originally reported should not forward such reports SAHPGL -CEM -PV-04_ADR_reporting_post_marketing_ June 2022_v 9.1 Page 17 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 to the Authority to avoid duplication of reporting. A n applicant/ HCR who receives such a report about its medicine from another applicant/ HCR is required to submit the report to the Authority within the same timeframe applicable to other repo rts. Details relating to the patient and the initial reporter are required as for any other report. In order to ensure confidentiality, initials of the patient and/or reporter may be used. 8.6 Confidentiality Strict confidentiality will be maintained by the Authority regarding the identities of the patient and the reporter. 9 VIGILANCE CONTACT DETAILS The Authority should be contacted on the below contact details for vigilance related matters as required by these guidelines: ADR /AEFI reports in an e2b in an e2b@sahpra.org.za All other Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) or Adverse Event Following adr@sahpra.org.za Pharmacovigilance related queries: pvqueries@sahpra.org.za Documentation relating to identified safety concerns, responses to PV recommendations, PSURs/PBRER, Risk 9.1 Page 18 of 22 Post -marketing Reporting of ADRs June 2022 10 REFERENCES 1.
