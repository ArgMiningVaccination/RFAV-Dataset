Different classes of antiretroviral medicines work against HIV in different ways and when combined are much more effective at controlling the virus and less likely to promote drug-resistance than when given singly. Combination treatment with at least three different antiretroviral medicines is now standard treatment for all people newly diagnosed with HIV. Combination antiretroviral therapy stops HIV from multiplying and can suppress HIV to undetectable levels in blood. This allows a person's immune system to recover, overcome infections and prevent the development of AIDS and other long-term effects of HIV infection. Civil society activists, working closely with researchers and national regulatory authorities, promoted unprecedented investment in AIDS research and accelerated access to new medicines. This enabled new medicines and combinations to get to patients faster than ever before. Pressure from the global AIDS movement also ensured that the prices of new medicines were rapidly brought down to make them affordable to almost every country in the world. Currently, there are 23.3 million people globally on HIV treatment. A person living with HIV who starts antiretroviral therapy today will have the same life expectancy as an HIV-negative person of the same age. Antiretroviral therapy results in better outcomes when started early after HIV infection rather than delaying treatment until symptoms develop. Antiretroviral therapy prevents HIV-related illness and disability and saves lives. AIDS-related deaths have globally declined by 43% since 2003. Antiretroviral therapy also has a prevention benefit. The evidence is now clear that people living with HIV with an [undetectable](/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) viral load cannot transmit HIV sexually. Safer and more effective antiretroviral medicines and combinations are increasingly available and affordable for low- and middle-income countries. Current World Health Organization recommended standard first-line antiretroviral therapy for adults and adolescents consists of two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus once-daily regimens are preferred. Second-line antiretroviral therapy in adults consist of two NRTIs plus a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor. The effectiveness of HIV treatment is best monitored by measuring the amount of HIV in a person's blood. If the virus cannot be detected they are said to have viral-load suppression\u2014indicating that their HIV infection is unlikely to progress and they are at no risk of transmitting the virus to their partner. Viral-load testing is recommended six months after starting antiretroviral therapy and annually thereafter to ensure that treatment is being taken and that drug-resistance has not developed. HIV treatment works best when taken as prescribed. Missing doses and stopping and re-starting treatment can lead to drug resistance, which can allow HIV to multiply and progress to disease. People living with HIV on treatment need to be provided with the support that they need to overcome the challenges to taking treatment regularly and robust systems to monitor drug resistance must be in place.
