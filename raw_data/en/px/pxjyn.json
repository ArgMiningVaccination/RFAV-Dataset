We're bombarded by marketing messages that tell us we'll be enough, if only we \"buy this\u2014do this\u2014look like this,\" making it difficult to simply relax in who we are and feel a sense of contentment in our lives. But there is a way out of this cycle of discontent, anxiety, and constant striving. If you're yearning to connect with life more deeply and feel a sense of greater peace and acceptance, I highly recommend developing a regular meditation practice. Before I began meditating, I was constantly agitated, anxious, and self-conscious, trapped in a mind that always found fault with myself\u2014and everyone and everything around me. Meditation is the closest thing I've found to a magic bullet in life. It can replace stress with calm, confusion with clarity, ignorance with self-awareness, and bitterness with grace. There's a lot we can't control in life, including our thoughts and feelings\u2014but we can control how we engage with them. And that's how we can find a little sliver of peace in this complex, chaotic world. It all starts with mindfulness. Not sure where to start, or how to take your practice to the next level? Tiny Buddha sponsor Shambhala Online has you covered! The nine courses I've shared below will allow you to learn from anywhere, on any schedule, and to revisit the content whenever you'd like to be refreshed or re-inspired. They're also great for when you feel your anxiety ramping up and need a de-stress tune-up, and something that reminds you that you are enough just as you are. All of the courses feature authentic and deeply experienced teachers from Shambhala's global community, and offer teachings from their Tibetan Buddhist heritage in forms that are direct and relevant for Western students. As a special gift to Tiny Buddha readers, the Shambhala team has included a unique 10% off code for each course. I hope you find something below that speaks to you!
