Ivan Stojmenovic / EyeEm / Getty Images Ways to Relieve Menopausal Hot Flashes Keep Cool There are several ways to help stop a hot flash quickly and keep yourself cool during the day and at night, such as: Dress in layers so you can easily remove clothes when a hot flash startsWear natural fibers (cotton, silk, and linen) instead of synthetic materials (polyester, rayon, and nylon)Carry a portable fan to use when a hot flash strikesUse cold water and cooling towels designed to cool the back of your neck quicklyLower the temperature in your bedroom at nightDrink small amounts of cold water before bedLayer your bedding so it can be adjusted as needed and turn on a fan Avoid Triggers For some people, certain foods or drinks may trigger hot flashes or make them worse. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods. These can make menopausal symptoms worse.Review your medications with your healthcare provider. Certain high blood pressure and cholesterol medicines are known to cause hot flashes. If your hot flashes seem to worsen after consuming these foods or drinks, try eliminating the suspected offenders and see if the hot flashes subside. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a treatment in which practitioners use very thin needles to stimulate specific points in the body. Some studies have shown acupuncture can be an effective way to treat hot flashes, including one study that found acupuncture reduced hot flashes by as much as 36.7%. And a review of 12 studies concluded that acupuncture improves menopausal hot flashes compared with no treatment. However, researchers have cautioned that most studies have been small and not always well-designed, so further research is needed. Mind-Body Approaches Mindfulness training is a type of exercise that is used to help people pay attention to their feelings and physical experiences for the purpose of gaining better control over thoughts. More research is needed into whether mindfulness can help reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes. However, there is some evidence that the practice may improve symptoms of anxiety and depression and sleep quality after menopause. Hypnosis\u2014a trance-like state where a person has increased suggestibility\u2014may also be an effective mind-body technique to reduce hot flashes. A 2019 review concluded that hypnosis as a mind-body approach has consistently shown clinically significant effects on reducing hot flashes. Soy Foods Soy foods (soybeans, soy milk, tofu, and tempeh) are good sources of phytoestrogens\u2014estrogen-like compounds found in plants that are structurally similar to the hormone estrogen. Phytoestrogens may work in the body like a weak form of estrogen, so in theory, could reduce hot flashes. Research has shown mixed results about whether soy helps with hot flashes. A 2015 review found five studies showed phytoestrogens had no effect on hot flashes compared to placebo, while another 10 studies found phytoestrogens resulted in a significantly greater reduction in hot flash frequency compared to placebo. Black Cohosh An herbal remedy that has estrogen-like properties, black cohosh is purported to alleviate symptoms of hot flashes. It may work when used in a specific product formulation (Remifemin, Phyopharmica/Enzymatic therapy), but a 2012 review of 16 studies concluded there was no significant difference between black cohosh and placebo in the frequency of hot flashes and that there's not enough evidence to support using black cohosh for menopausal symptoms. Because of its hormonal action, you should only use this herbal supplement with the approval of your healthcare professional. 15 Supplements for Menopause Symptoms Red Clover Red clover is part of the legume family (peas and beans) and contains isoflavones\u2014compounds that are structurally similar to estrogen. Extracts from red clover are promoted for relieving hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. An analysis of eight clinical trials found that people taking red clover had fewer hot flashes compared to those receiving a placebo. And a 2016 review concluded that taking red clover may decrease the frequency of hot flashes, especially in women with severe hot flashes (five or more per day), but additional clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings. Safety Note About Natural Remedies Always remember that natural does not necessarily mean safe. Many herbal, plant, and dietary supplements interact with medications or may have a negative impact on medical conditions. Natural approaches are not risk-free, and the more you know, the better you can choose treatments that will keep you safe and well. Before deciding to use alternative and complementary remedies for hot flashes, check with your healthcare provider and read up on possible side effects and cautions for any remedy you are considering. Summary Natural remedies can help prevent or reduce the severity of hot flashes. First, it's important to take steps to avoid hot flash triggers and make sure to keep cool whenever possible. You can also try eating soy-based foods, or taking black cohosh or red clover. These plants contain estrogen-like compounds, which may help reduce hot flashes. Some people also have success with acupuncture and mind-body approaches. Be sure to consult your healthcare provider before you try any natural remedies.
