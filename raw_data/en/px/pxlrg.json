There are six in total, beginning with \"Do no harm.\" This is because naturopathy always takes the route that is most beneficial for each patient, whether that utilizes prescription medication, restorative therapies, or lifestyle changes. With this comes an understanding of the healing power of nature, i.e., your own body. We understand the body's ability to heal itself and do incredible things with the right tools. In order for your body to do this, we believe in treating the whole person by looking at you not as a list of symptoms, but as an interconnected system of mind, body, and spirit. We're not looking to patch your symptoms, but instead to treat the cause of illness. We want to know why you're experiencing the issues you have and give you the highest chance of success in health. We know that increasing those chances means empowering you with information through a doctor who is also a teacher. Most healing happens after your visit, and we want to equip you with a full understanding of your health and return power back to our patients. Lastly, we focus on prevention. By promoting overall health and wellness, we aim to keep you ahead of the curve and thriving on a physical, emotional, and spiritual level. At Remedy Health, we use these guiding principles to treat each patient with respect and kindness as we address your unique health needs in a confidential space.
