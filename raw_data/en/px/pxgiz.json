You don't have to rely on invasive procedures or drugs that cause more side effects than they control. Functional Medicine combines modern science with ancient healing wisdoms from all over the world, including Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). It is considered by many to be \"The Medicine for the 21st Century\". It creates a focus on prevention through nutrition, diet, exercise, stress management, emotional therapy and detoxification. The integrative approach with Functional Medicine has helped many people living with chronic or life-threatening illnesses change their lives. Functional Medicine practitioners and clinicians focus on restoring balance to dysfunctional systems. Each body is different, therefore each remedy and solution changes depending upon your symptoms, history and goals. Unlike Western Medicine, Functional Medicine is not a \"one-size fits all\", and is tailored to the needs of your body. Some of the different services to assist the body in repairing, detoxifying and regenerating cells back to their original state include chelation, ionic foot detox, nutrition, bio mat sessions and intravenous nutrition. Chelation is administered intravenously, and is composed of agents that bind to metal ions and mobilize them from tissue stores. Prior to the chelation IV, a urinary metal challenge test will be assessed to determine the degree of the retention of metals in your body. The ionic foot detox assists in restoring energy and facilitating detoxification through the skin, the second largest detoxifying system in your body. After the ionic foot bath, an herbal foot steam with a tailored herbal formula will replenish your organs and body. Nutrition is a dietary approach that has been most helpful with patients who complain of fatigue, recurrent gastrointestinal problems, food intolerance or sensitivity, chemical or environment sensitivities, chronic headaches and muscle or joint pain of unknown origin. Based on the consultation and additional evidence gathered, a personal nutrition plan will be created specifically for you. A follow-up after your departure on your nutrition and impact on your body will occur two to three weeks later. This takes some discipline, which is why we have you on-site for at least three days to assist with the temptations! The bio-mat is an amethyst-filled pad that heats up through infrared waves. It has many benefits, including improvements in skin appearance and the immune system, helps burn calories, reduces stress and fatigue, relieves pain, increases blood circulation, and strengthens the cardiovascular system. Purely by relaxing on the bio-mat, your body burns calories by producing sweat and pumping blood. This is how it increases your circulation and skin appearance as well: giving your cells the proper nutrition through the blood. By the heat created in the mat, it increases your body temperature and induces an artificial fever, which strengthens your immune system from your body's reaction to combat the \"fever\". The Nutritional IV Cocktail is a form of intravenous nutrient therapy. This injects a combination of magnesium, calcium, vitamins C, B12, B6, and B complex directly into the bloodstream. This improves your energy capacity and cell function, thus assisting patients recovering from acute and chronic conditions such as asthma, migraines, allergies, high cholesterol, chronic pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, cardiovascular disease, acute muscle spasms, depression, COPD, diabetes, hepatitis and even the common cold. In addition, this nutritional cocktail is also effective in providing a natural energy boost, a strengthened immune system to help fight off viral illnesses, and relieving symptoms of fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and chronic depression. The energy boost can last for several days or weeks, and can significantly improve a patient's quality of life. With all of these external aids in detoxing, repairing and renourishing your body, it wouldn't be complete without some internal aids. This is where the tai chi, qi gong and life planning sessions come in. Realize where your strengths and weaknesses are in life, and learn exercises that are tailored specifically to your body and its needs. Tai chi and qi gong help open up the meridians in the body, loosen muscle tension, relieve stress and balance your mind. Put the power of your health back in your hands this August.
