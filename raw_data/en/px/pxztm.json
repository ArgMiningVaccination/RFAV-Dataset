The word \"REGENERATION\" is almost never referenced in the world today, only the word \"DEGENERATION\". I follow the traditions and beliefs of Traditional Chinese Medicine - \" The Philosophy of Regeneration\" which is the Nourishing, Balancing, and Cleansing, of the body on a cellular level. I believe in cellular regeneration which can not be achieved through the numerous therapies being offered. I believe regeneration is exactly what is being accomplished in my life and is constantly ongoing. THE FOLLOWING IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TASK OF CELL REGENERATION We continue to Age and Degenerate because we are unable to supply the body \"over and above\" what is needed to nourish, cleanse, and regenerate the cell. This is due to the majority of that energy going toward the digestion of the food we ingest. But there is a way to bypass the digestive tract where all the energy can be derived from concentrated, live foods which can be used towards the healing of the body.
