The current study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effects of two types of mushrooms, Ganoderma lucidum (GL) and Auricularia polytricha (AP), against carbofuran- (CF) toxicity in rats. Male Wistar rats (=4 2 ) were divided into six equal groups. The rats in the negative control group received oral administration of CF at 1 mg/kg with the normal diet for 28 days. The treatment groups received oral administration of ethanolic extract of GL or AP at 100 mg/kg followed by coadministration of CF at 1 mg/kg with the normal diet for the same experimental period, respectively. In the CF alone treated group, there were significant decreases in the erythrocytic and thrombocytic indices but increases in the concentrations of the total leukocytes, including theagranulocytes. A significant increase in all of the liver function biomarkers except albumin, in lipid profiles except high-density lipoprotein, and in the kidney function markers occurred in the negative control group compared to the rats of the normal control and positive control groups. The coadministration of mushroom extracts significantly ameliorated the toxic effects of the CF. TheGL mushroom extract was more efficacious than that of the AP mushroom, possibly due to the presence of high levels of phenolic compounds and other antioxidants in the GL mushroom. 1. Introduction Carbofuran (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl-N methyl carbamate; CF) is one of the carbamate pesticidescommonly used to combat insects, mites, and nematodesin the soil for fruits, vegetables, and forest crops [1]. Due tothe widespread agricultural and household use of this agent,the contamination of food, water, soil, and air has becomea serious concern based on its inevitable consequences ofadverse health effects in humans, animals, wildlife, andfish [2]. Some studies proposed that CF has significantharmful effects on the liver and kidney functions as wellas on certain blood parameters of rats [3-5]. Oxidativestress has been proposed as an alternative mechanism of CFtoxicity in certain animal tissues, occurring via impairmentof mitochondrial respiratory system that leads to increasedgeneration of free radicals through lipid peroxidation of cellmembrane which play significant roles in the pathogenesisof a number of complications [6, 7]. Mitigating the by the carbamate pesticides, the exogenous Hindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2018, Article ID 6254929, 13 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/6254929 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine supply of antioxidants can improve the capacity of the tissue to cope with the high antioxidant demands [8]. Mushrooms are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine as well as being commonly used as a food item[9]. Currently, many species of medicinal mushrooms arecommercially available in many countries. Among these mushrooms, Ganoderma lucidum (GL) (also known as Lingzhi or Reishi) [10] and Auricularia polytricha (AP) (also known as cloud ear fungus or jelly ear fungus, a species that is closely related to Auricularia auricula-judae )a r ew e l l known for their medicinal properties. GL is an orientalfungus with a large, dark glossy exterior and a woody texture[ 1 0 ] .I th a sb e e ns h o w nt op r o d u c ea n t i t u m o rc o m p o u n d s ,hypoglycemic polysaccharides, immunomodulatory proteins(LZ-8), and many bioactive oxygenated triterpenoids witha very broad spectrum of biological activities and phar-macological functions [11]. On the other hand, AP is anear-like brown mushroom that grows on wood and itsmedicinal properties may be contributed by its non-starchpolysaccharides, including three D-glucans and two acidicheteropolysaccharides [12]. GL and riboflavin, folate, thiamine, pantothenicacid, and niacin, and also contain several minerals, such asselenium, potassium, copper, iron, and phosphorus which arevery essential for the maintenance of liver enzyme functionsa n dh e l pt od e t o x i f ys o m ec a r c i n o g e n i cc o m p o u n d si nt h ebody [13]. In fact, modern pharmacological and clinicalinvestigations have demonstrated that GL and AP containactive constituents with numerous pharmacological cardiovascular, respiratory, and antihepatotoxic functions [14, 15]. Previous data have confirmed that the two mushroom species containhigh amounts of naturally occurring antioxidants, includingascorbic acid, tocopherol, compounds withrobust radical antioxidant activities [16].Thus, it is hypothesized that GL and AP mushrooms canmitigate oxidative stress and other toxicities induced by CF.Therefore, the aim of this study was (1) to identify the activephenolic compounds in these mushrooms, (2) to determinethe effects of CF on hematological and biochemical changesin rats, and (3) to determine the ameliorative effects of the GLand AP mushrooms against CF-induced toxicity. 2. Materials and Method 2.1. Pesticide and Mushroom Collection. CF (25 g) was pur- chased from Shetu Corporation Limited, Bangladesh, in apowdered form (C 12H15NO3, purity 98%) and was subse- quently stored at 4C. The GL and AP mushrooms were collected in powdered form (dry samples were crushed intoa fine powder using a household blender) from the Mush-room Development and Extension Centre, Savar, Dhaka,Bangladesh, in summer following authentication of thespecies. 2.2. Extract Preparation. The powdered mushroom samples were extracted with 95% ethanol in a conical flask at 30 C for 72 hours using a shaker incubator (KS 4000 ic, IKA,Germany) at 150 rpm. Thereafter, the extracts were filtered through Whatman no. 1 filter paper (Hangzhou Xlnhua PaperIndustry Co. Ltd., China), followed by evaporation usinga rotary evaporator (R-215, BUCHI, Switzerland) under areduced pressure (100 psi) at a controlled temperature (40 C) to remove any residual solvent. The samples were then stored at20Cu n t i la n a l y s i s . 2.3. HPLC Analysis of Phenolic Compounds. From the dry extracts, free phenolic compounds were detected following previous methods [17, 18] with slight modification. Briefly, theextracts (100 mg) were dissolved in 10 ml acidified water (pH2.0) and extracted with 10 ml methanol. The organic layer wascollected for centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min followedby filtration through a 0.45 m syringe filter (Sartorius AG, G e r m a n y ) .Th efi l t r a t e( 5 m L )w a st h e np a s s e dt h r o u g ha0.20m nylon membrane filter (Sigma, USA) and the 20 L of filtrate was loaded on the HPLC system (SPD-20AV , serialnumber: mm, 5m), HPLC column was used. A linear gradient at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was used and the total analytical time wasapproximately 35 min. The binary mobile phase consisted ofsolvent A (ultrapure water with 0.1% phosphoric acid) andsolvent B (pure methanol with 0.1% phosphoric acid). Elution from the column was achieved with the following gradient: 0 to 10 min of solvent B, increased from 35% to 55%; 10 to2 5m i no fs o l v e n tB ,i n c r e a s e dt o6 2 % ;2 5t o3 0m i no fs o l v e n tB, increased to 85%, and the final composition was keptconstant up to 35 min. The detection wavelength was fixedbetween 200 and 450 nm, with specific monitoring conductedat 265 nm. The identification of phenolic and flavonoidcompounds was performed by comparing the retention timeso ft h ea n a l y t e sw i t ht h er e f e r e n c es t a n d a r d s .P h e n o l i c si n c l u d -ing tannic, gallic, pyrogallol, vanillic, benzoic, catechin,naringin, rutin, and quercetin) were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and were used as reference standards. All solvents were of HPLC grade. 2.4. Animals. Male Wistar rats with body weights (BW) in the range of 150-155 g were used for the experiment. The rats were obtained from Department of Pharmacy, Jahangir-nagar University, and were maintained at a constant roomtemperature ( 23 \u00b1 2 C) in an environment with humidity ranging from 40% to 70%. The rats were housed in clean plastic cages and received a natural 12-h day-night cycle. Th e yw e r ep r o v i d e dw i t hs t a n d a r df o o da n dw a t e ra dl i b i t u m .The experiments were conducted according to the ethicalguidelines as approved by the Bangladesh Association forLaboratory Animal Science. The experimental protocol wasapproved by the Biosafety, Biosecurity & Ethical Committeeof Jahangirnagar University. 2.5. Study Design. A l lr a t sw e r ea c c l i m a t e dt ot h el a be n v i r o n - ment for one week prior to the experiment. The experiment Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 was conducted for 28 days using doses for the mushrooms a n dC Ft h a tw e r es e l e c t e db a s e do nt h o s er e p o r t e di np r e v i o u sstudies [7, 19]. The hypothesized oxidative stress in rat's tissuewas reported to occur following 1 mg/kg of CF treatment [7].A total of 42 rats were randomly divided into 6 groups ( =7 in each group), as follows: (1) Normal control: the rats received 0.5 mL olive oil/rat via oral gavage and a normal diets for 28 days. (2) Positive control-1: the rats received the GL extract (100 mg/kgBW/day) dissolved in saline water via oralgavage and a normal diet for 28 days. (3) Positive control-2: the rats received the AP extract (100 mg/kgBW/day) dissolved in saline water via oralgavage and a normal diet for 28 days. (4) Negative control: the rats received CF (1 mg/kg BW/ day) (1/5 of lethal dose 50%; LD 50)d i s s o l v e di no l i v e oil (0.5 mL/rat) via oral gavage and a normal diet for28 days. (5) CF + GL: the rats received the GL extract (100 mg/ kg BW/day) dissolved in saline water along with CF(1 mg/kg BW/day) dissolved in olive oil (0.5 mL/rat)v i ao r a lg a v a g ea n dan o r m a ld i e tf o r2 8d a y s . (6) CF + AP: the rats received the AP extract (100 mg/kg BW/day) dissolved in saline water along with CF(1 mg/kg BW/day) dissolved in olive oil (0.5 mL/rat)v i ao r a lg a v a g ea n dan o r m a ld i e tf o r2 8d a y s . All administrations were conducted in the morning (between09:00 and 10:00 AM). During the experimental period, therats were observed for any abnormal clinical signs and/ordeath; changes in body weight were evaluated on a weeklybasis. At the end of the experiment, all rats were sacrificed using deep anesthesia with ketamine hydrochloride injection (1 mL/150 g) followed by dissection. Blood samples (5 mL) were withdrawn from the inferior vena cava for hematolog-ical and biochemical analyses using a heparinized syringe(5 mL). From each rat, the liver, kidneys, heart, brain, andpancreas were immediately removed and were placed onice for calculation of the fraction of the body weight.For the hematological analysis, blood samples (1 mL) weredirectly transferred into EDTA tubes and were stored at20 C until analysis. For the biochemical analyses, the blood samples (4 mL) were collected into sterile test tubes andallowed to clot at ambient temperature for 30 min followedby centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min to separate theserum, which was then stored at 20 Cp r i o rt oa n a l y - sis. 2.6. Evaluation of Hematological Parameters. To evaluate the hematological parameters, the blood samples (1 mL) were analyzed following standard protocols using an auto-mated hematology analyzer (XS 1000i, Sysmex CorporationLtd., Japan). hematologicalparameters were as follows.2.7 . Erythrocytic Parameters. Erythrocytic parameters are red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit(HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscularhemoglobin red cell devi-ation (RDW and red cell distribution width-coefficient of variation (RDW CV). 2.8.

The total protein inheart tissue homogenates was estimated by the Lowry et al.method [21]. 2.12. Histopathological Examination. The liver and kidney tis- sues were dissected and were fixed in 10% formalin. The fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and were cut into serialsections (5mt h i c k )u s i n gar o t a r ym i c r o t o m e .E a c hs e c t i o n was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Micro-scopic observation was performed using St Veit/Glan, Austria). The pathologist whoperformed the histopathological evaluation was blinded tothe treatment assignments of the different study groups. 2.13. Statistical Analysis. All analyses were performed in triplicate. The data are expressed as the means \u00b1standard deviation (SD). The data were analyzed using GRAPHPAD PRISM (version 6.00; GraphPad software Inc., San Diego,CA, USA) and SPSS (Statistical Packages for Social Science,version 22.0, IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York). 4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 1: Phenolic and flavonoid compounds detected in Ganoderma (5)(6)(7)(mV)750 500 250 0 (min)0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 (a) (8)(10)(11) (9)(mV) (min)0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35400 300 200100 0 (b) (7)(1)(4) (8)(mV)750 500 250 0 (min)0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 (c) (7)(2)(mV) (min)0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35250 200 150 100 50 0 (d) Figure 1: Chromatogram of phenolic compound analysis by HPLC.

Results A total of eleven phenolic compounds were investigated in this study in which seven were phenolic acids and fourwere flavonoid compounds (Figure 1 and Table 1). In GL mushroom, three phenolic acids including tannic, vanillic, salicylic acids and a flavonoid, catechin, were detected. On the other hand, AP mushroom contained gallic and vanillicacids. Overall, the concentration of phenolic acids was higherin GL than AP mushroom, indicating the high antioxidantproperties of the former.During the experimental periods, none of the animals in the normal and positive control groups showed anynoticeable signs of toxicity. Noticeable toxic signs, such asmild tremors, soft feces (mild diarrhea), depression, and dyspnea, were observed mainly in negative control group.

The negative control group showed also a progressive increase in their body weights over the 28-day period with a significant increaseof 10.33% in their body weights at the termination of thestudy, which was significantly less than that of the normal andpositive control groups. On the other hand, the CF + GL andthe CF + AP groups showed progressive increases of 12.06%and 11.01% of their body weights, respectively, over the studyperiod that indicated protection against the toxic effect of CF.The mitigating rates were determined to be 18.65% for CF +GL group and 8.79% for CF + AP group. Administration of CF (at 1 mg/kg) showed significant adverse effect on the mean relative liver weights [(liver weight/body weight) \u00d7100] in the negative control group. However, the mean relative liver weight of the CF + GL groupwas significantly increased. On the other hand, for the otherorgans (such as kidney, heart, brain, and pancreas), there wereno significant differences among the groups for the mean relative weight [(organ weight/body weight) \u00d7100].The data for the comparisons of the hematological param- eters in the control and treated groups are shown in Figures 2 ,3 ,a n d4 .Th en e g a t i v ec o n t r o lr a t sh a ds i g n i fi c a n t l yl o w e r values for RBC (10 RDW CV normal control (Figure 2).

Discussion To our knowledge, our study is the first to report on the ameliorative effects of orally administered GL and APmushrooms against CF-induced oxidative injuries in the rats'liver and kidney. GL conferred better protection against CF-induced toxicity than AP for most of the parameters suggest-ing its superior antioxidant activities as also indicated by thehigher concentration of phenolic compounds determined inGL as compared to AP . Among the eleven phenolic compounds, gallic and vanil- lic acids were detected in AP while GL contained tannic,vanillic, and salicylic acids as well as catechin. Among thefour phenolic compounds, vanillic acid was markedly higherwhich is also supported by the investigations of Kim et al. [22]. Presently, the use of carbamate pesticides exceeds the use of organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides, on the basis that the carbamylated enzyme is much more labile andreactivates quickly with a rate between minutes and an hour[ 2 3 ] .H o w e v e r ,s o m eo ft h ec a r b a m a t e s ,e s p e c i a l l yC F ,a r eextremely toxic, and overexposure of individuals involved inits production, transportation, and use can result in seriousadverse health effects [24]. Because changes in rat body weights may provide an indication of CF-induced toxicity, this was the first param-eter investigated. The oral administration of CF (1 mg/kg)decreased the total body weight gain of the rats in thenegative control group compared to the normal controlgroup. However, the body weights of treatment groups (CF+ GL and CF + AP) were improved compared to the negativecontrol group. The underlying mechanism for the decrease inthe body weights of the rats treated with CF may be due to thedirect cytotoxic effects of pesticides on somatic cells and/orindirect actions through the central nervous system, whichcontrols feed and water intake and regulates the endocrinesystem [25]. Another plausible underlying mechanism couldinvolve the rapid destruction of the cell membranes via lipidperoxidation, which occurs when a free radical-mediatedattack on the membrane lipids is propagated via an auto-catalytic chain of reactions of lipid peroxidation processesin the presence of oxygen [26]. Because the rats from theC F+G La n dt h eC F+A Pg r o u p sc o n s u m e dG La n dA Pmushrooms with the CF, the cytotoxic and oxidative stresscaused by CF were ameliorated and the body weight gain wasrestored (by 18.65% and 8.79%, respectively) compared with the negative control group. Our study also confirmed that oral administration of CF at 1 mg/kg body weight for consecutive28 days has significant ( < 0.05) adverse effect on the mean relative liver weights, because the liver is the first organexposed to metabolizing any upcoming metabolites fromgastrointestinal tract following oral ingestion [27]. However,the CF administration had no significant ( <0.05)e ff e c t so n the other organs, such as kidney, heart, brain, and pancreasperhaps because of the low bioavailability; that is, the lowdose of CF was less likely to cause large scale toxicity throughthe body [28]. These molecular mechanisms may also beresponsible for the clinical signs and symptoms as mentionedin the Results section.The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly used blood screening tests and indicates ananimal's or a person's overall health. In the present study, weexamined three types of blood cells including erythrocytes,lymphocytes, and thrombocytes. The RBC indices are calcu-lations derived from the CBC that aid in the diagnosis and classification of anemia. Several previous studies have shown that organophosphate and organochlorine insecticides canalter hematological parameters in experimental animals [29-31]. Our study confirmed that the carbamate group pesticideCF also altered the hematological parameters significantly.The present results revealed that exposure to CF was associ-ated with significant decreases in the RBC, HGB, HCT, MCH,MCHC, RDW SD, and RDW CV parameters. A similar trend was observed in rabbits treated with cypermethrin [32].The reduction in the HGB content might be related to thedecreased size of RBCs or to the impaired biosynthesis ofheme in the bone marrow [33]. In addition, the reduction inthe blood parameters may be attributed to a hyperactivity oft h eb o n em a r r o w[ 3 4 ]l e a d i n gt ot h ep r o d u c t i o no fr e db l o o dcells with impaired integrity which were easily destroyed inthe circulation. Shakoori et al. [35] reported that a decreasein RBC counts is indicative of either excessive damage tothe erythrocytes or inhibition of erythrocyte formation. Ourstudy confirmed that CF induced anemia by reducing thetotal RBCs, HGB, and also HCT (the percentage of bloodby volume that is occupied by the red cells). Treatmentwith CF also significantly reduced the MCV , MCH, MCHC,RDW SD, and RDW CV values, which indicated that it causes the microcytic type of anemia.

Inaddition, CF significantly reduced the granulocyte counts(especially NEUT and EO) compared to those of the controlrats as also found by Elsharkawy et al. [29]. Increases inleukocyte counts may indicate an activation of the animal'sdefense mechanism [32]. It is plausible that the toxic effectsof CF weakened the rats' immune system, which permittedthe acquisition of infections that stimulated a further immuneresponse [30]. On the other hand, decreases in the PLT, MPV ,PDW , PCT, and P-LCR levels were observed in the CF-treatedgroup compared to the control group. These changes weresimilar to that reported by Kalender et al. [38, 39]. Thesedecreases occurred due to rapid platelet destruction [29]as indicated by previous reports that numerous xenobioticshave the ability to block platelet receptor binding or tochange the platelet membrane charge or permeability [40].Coadministration with GL and AP mushrooms significantly normalize these leukocyte and platelet counts in CF-treated rats compared to negative control rats. In this study, the toxic effects of CF on liver function were investigated by determining the activities of variousenzymes (ALT, AST, ALP , and LDH) and the plasma protein Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9 Table 5: Semiquantitative scoring of the architectural changes following histopathological examination of the rat's liver and kidney.

These substances are impor-tant for maintaining the permeability, integrity, and otherimportant characteristics of the cell membrane, includingthe maintenance of electrophysiology balance and stability[41].

Another important liver biomarker, totalbilirubin, can also be increased in the CF-treated group,which may contribute to the onset of periportal necrosisas reported by Clifford and Rees [42].

Similar trends have previously been observed in studies of other pesticides[45]. The increase in the serum cholesterol levels may bedue to increased cholesterol synthesis in the liver [46]. Theelevation of the serum TC may also be thestimulation of catecholamines, which promote lipolysis andincrease fatty acid production. The observed elevation inthe total serum cholesterol levels could be due to blockageof the liver bile ducts, which would cause a decrease orcessation of the cholesterol secretion into the duodenum.This would subsequently lead to cholestasis. Furthermore,the elevation of the serum TG levels has been attributed toinhibition of the lipase enzyme activities that target boththe hepatic triglycerides and plasma lipoproteins [47]. Inaddition, our study also showed that oral treatment withCF induced a significant decrease in serum HDL. HDL ismainly synthesized in the liver and intestinal cells. It plays animportant role in cholesterol efflux from tissues, after whichthe cholesterol is carried back into the liver for removal asbile acids [48]. It has been established that reduced levels ofHDL-C are associated with a higher risk of coronary arterydisease [49]. Moreover, in the treatment groups (CF + GL andCF + AP), lipid levels were restored when compared to thenegative control rats. This may occur due to the inhibitionof cholesterol absorption and biosynthesis which may becontributed by the activation of the lipase enzymes as wella st h ei n c r e a s ei nt h ee x c r e t i o no fb i l ea c i d sd u et ot h ea c t i v ecompounds present in the mushroom extracts [16, 43].

Low creatinine and urea clearance indicate a weakened ability of the kidneys to filterthese waste products from the blood and excrete them inthe urine. Moreover, elevated blood urea is correlated withincreased protein catabolism in the body [51]. Pesticide-induced increases in the urea level as observed in the presents t u d ym a yb ed u et ot h ee ff e c to fC Fo nt h el i v e rf u n c t i o nbecause urea is the end product of protein catabolism [52].This possibility is supported by the decrease in the levels ofthe plasma protein ALB. Coadministration of mushroomsextracts (GL and AP mushroom) normalized the ALB, urea,and creatinine level compared to negative control rats. LPO generally refers to the oxidative degradation of lipids in which free radicals acquire the electrons from the lipidsin cell membranes, resulting in cell damage. Increased LPOappears to be the initial stage where the liver and kidneytissue become more susceptible to oxidative damage. How-ever, coadministration with the two mushrooms significantlyreduced the levels of lipid peroxides in CF-exposed ratssuggesting its protective effects against oxidative damage.Moreover, our histomorphological observations in the liverand kidney tissues also confirmed the protective effects ofG La n dA Po nC F - i n d u c e dt o x i c i t y .Th el i v e r so fn e g a t i v econtrol rats showed a moderately disrupted arrangement ofthe hepatocytes with congestion of the central vein seen.

Conclusion Our study confirmed that the GL and AP mushrooms confersignificant protective effects against CF-induced toxic effectson the body weight, hematological, and several biochemicalparameters and that the GL mushroom provided betterprotective effects than the AP mushroom against CF-inducedtoxicity.
