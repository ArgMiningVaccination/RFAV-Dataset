It has now been approved that woman can take COVID-19 vaccines even during pregnancy. How will it help? During the second wave, many women contracted COVID-19 during pregnancy compared to the first wave. COVID if severe can lead to serious complications during pregnancy, especially during the last trimester as the uterus is enlarged and presses on the diaphragm, compromising a woman's ability to cope with a fall in oxygen saturation. This may lead to a sudden fall in blood oxygen saturation and risk the lives of both the mother and the child. Vaccines will help prevent severe disease in pregnant women. Also, vaccinating a mother is likely to give some degree of protection to the new-born as the antibodies developed in the mother's body post-vaccination will pass on to the developing foetus through her blood. In the case of lactating mothers, an infant gets these antibodies through the mother's breast milk.

The approach which could inhibit both maturation and propagation of viruses during the infection in the host cells can help produce new COVID-19 medicines with improved production methods. The area of multistage targeted inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 has emerged few months back after WHO announced Covid-19 as global emergency. The multistage process involves viral genome replication, transcription and maturation are the multistage processes, which are interlinked in the viral machinery and promote viral propagation. They are regulated by the enzymes protease and RNA replicase. Inhibiting these effects would be crucial to complete the dream of millions of people on this earth to develop/repurpose a drug molecule against COVID-19.
