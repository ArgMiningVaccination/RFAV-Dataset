Readers are encouraged to use this manual as a tool to keep notes, organize personal information, and stimulate discussion between themselves, their family members, and their healthcare providers. See \"HOW TO USE THE MANUAL\" section. The content of the Manual represents an overview of ALS, coping tips and tools, where to go for help and support, and issues people diagnosed with ALS should begin thinking about early, such as assistive equipment that might be needed and legal and financial concerns for the future. In the area of clinical disease management, there is information about the healthcare professionals who make up the ALS care team, an overview of symptoms and functional changes associated with ALS, and specific information on a variety of disease management topics such as mobility, breathing, nutrition, oral care, communication, andend-of-life advance care planning. Information about some aspects of ALS changes from time to time and understandably people want to be kept up-to-date with the latest information. However, sometimes news, particularly in the area of research and clinical trials, changes faster than the Society canupdate the manuals. To stay informed, the Society web site (www.als.ca), local ALS Societies, and ALS clinical specialists should be checked with from time to time for new information. Updated editions of the Manual will be published periodically, so readers with suggestions for updating or changing content, or altering the format to be as user-friendly as possible, are asked to share their insights by sending an e-mail to alscanada@als.ca. It is our intent that reading this Manual will contribute to one's strength and encouragement. Strength from better understanding the challenges to be faced and encouragement from knowing that many others with ALS have found that even as the disease take its physical toll, their spirits have remained strong, surrounded by the love of their families and those who care for them.2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 9A Manual for People Living with ALSACKNOWLEDGEMENT (Photo and permission to use provided by Sandra Macdonald) xPrevious editions of this Manual have been used as a source of information and support by many people across this country living with ALS, including those with the disease, their families, and caregivers. This was especially true for its original author Bob Macdonald.Bob had a unique exposure to ALS through his grandmother's, his father's, and his own experience living with the disease. When he was diagnosed with familial ALS, he plunged full force into the prepara- tion of the first version of this resource manual. His search for more information on the disease to expand on what he already knew led him around the world through his computer. The fruits of his search are still evident here in the seventh edition whichreflects updated information thanks to the health care professional contributors who so graciously gave of their time to review the Manual and provide neces- sary changes (see \"Contributors\"). This manual is dedicated to the memory of all those who have lived with ALS, but in particular to Bob Macdonald who held a vision for the original edition and inspired its continuation. -2012 Bob MacdonaldBob Macdonald2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 10ALS.

However, with scientific technologyspeeding ahead faster and faster, there is more hope now than ever before that better treatments forALS will be found, and that one day there will be acure. But for today, know that there are organizations,health professionals, and others living with ALS whocan help support you. As you live with ALS alwaysremember: ALS may rob you of your physical body, but it does not rob you of your soul. You live in a society that emphasizes patient autono-my and you will be able to maintain yours. While embarking on a difficult journey, know you arenot going it alone. Families and friends can becomecloser than ever, and you will discover new friendswho understand. Other people with ALS are available and willing toshare in the ups and downs of the journey. There are many dimensions to managing ALS andmany professionals available to help you with them. The resources currently available to patients are with-out precedent.A MESSAGE OF HOPE You continue to be a valued member of society whocan contribute to your family and your friendsthrough the human values in which you believe. You continue to play a role in educating your chil-dren and providing support to your family. Due to the intense interest in people with ALS, theoptions available to you exceed those that were avail-able to previous generations and are expected toincrease. While no one has chosen this path, most have tra-versed it with courage and with dignity. 2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 13ALS.

SECTION 1A Manual for People Living with ALSAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A= absence of myo= muscle trophic= nourishment Lateral= side (of spine) Sclerosis = hardening dr. Jean-Martin Charcot, a French pathologist who founded the field of neurology, pub-lished the first full account of the symptoms of ALS in 1874. ALS is also known as Charcot'sDisease, Lou Gehrig's Disease, and the most commonform of Motor Neuron Disease (MND). In Canada,two to three people with ALS die each day. Other types of MND you may know, although less common than ALS, are primary lateral sclerosis (PLS)and Kennedy's Disease (KD). PLS is different fromALS in that it does not involve muscle wasting, mayprogress over decades, and the expected lifespan maybe normal. Kennedy's Disease, a form of adult-onsetspinal muscular atrophy (SMA), is different from ALSin that it is a chromosomal X-linked recessive disease.Therefore only males are diagnosed. It is most oftendiagnosed between ages 20-40 years, progresses veryslowly, and the expected lifespan is often normal. Some people diagnosed with PLS at first may end up getting an ALS diagnosis after a few years if musclewasting symptoms also occur. Sometimes people withKennedy's Disease are misdiagnosed with ALS initially.An actual diagnosis of Kennedy's Disease is possiblethrough DNA testing http://www.kennedysdisease.org. ALS destroys motor neurons which are an important link in the nervous system. It is through motor neurons that the brain sends messages to the voluntary muscles throughout the body (muscles whose movement you can control as opposed to those you cannot, like theheart). Leg and foot muscles are controlled by motor neurons in the lower spinal cord. Arm, hand and finger muscles are controlled by motor neurons in the upper spinal cord. Speaking, swallowing and chewing are con- trolled by motor neurons in the brain stem. Respiratory muscles are controlled by motor neurons in the upper and thoracic levels (mid section) of the spinal cord. The diagram below shows you what a motor neuronconsists of: ALS does not affect the five senses of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, nor does it normally affect theeye muscles, heart, bladder, bowel, or sexual muscles.There is no possibility that ALS is contagious. ALS strikes about six to eight people per 100,000. With an estimated Canadian population of 34 million,approximately 2,000 - 3,000 people in Canada currentlyhave ALS. In any given year, about two new cases ofALS per 100,000 people will be diagnosed. The inci-dence of ALS (new cases) increases with age (Strongand Shaw, 2003). ALS most often occurs between theages of 40 and 70, but it can also occur in older andyounger adults, and rarely in teenagers (Mitsumoto and Munsat, 2001). DESCRIPTION OF ALS Dendrite Cell Body Axon Hillock Axon Schwann Cell Node of Ranvier Myelin sheath TYPES OF ALS The most common form of ALS is called Sporadic ALS.About 5-10% of cases are the inherited variety called familial ALS. Until recently, an abnormally high incidence of ALS was observed in the Western Pacific (Guam, Kii Peninsula of Japan, Papua NewGuinea). As a result of extensive research intoGuamanian ALS, it is now thought that these highincidence rates were due to specific dietary toxins (forexample, aluminum and cycasin). With theWesternization of this region, and the reduceddependency on traditional foodstuffs, major declines inthe incidence of ALS in this region have occurred.2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 14ALS.

SECTION 1 004muscle cramps weakened reflexes flaccidity (decreased muscle tone) difficulty swallowing inability to articulate speech shortness of breath at rest Upper Motor neuron degeneration: muscle stiffness, or rigidity emotional lability (decreased ability to control laughing or crying) increased or hyperactive reflexes Some may assume that these are signs of normal aging. Over time, as muscles continue to weaken, and the weakening spreads throughout the body, itbecomes more apparent that the cause is ALS. In addition to a physical examination, people are often given an electromyography (EMG) test, blood tests, a MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), and other tests to search for the presence of other diseases that can look like ALS. Many doctors, including neurologists, do not have experience with recognizing and treating ALS. It isbest to find out who in your province is familiar withALS as soon as possible. Often patients are sent toALS specialists to confirm a diagnosis and tell thepatient they have ALS. Telling someone and his or her family that they may have ALS requires a sensitive, understanding andcompassionate manner. People have been diagnosedshould be fully informed about the disease, treatments,current research and drug trials, and available supportservices, such as the ALS Society in their province. See the Resource Section at the end of the Manual for books, videos, and web sites about ALS. Epidemiological research, the study of disease trends within a population, helps to better understand a dis-ease through the collection of information related todisease onset, progression, treatment and care, anddemographic, environmental/lifestyle exposure factors.Symptoms are what you experience, or feel whereas signs are what you can see or measure. The earlysymptoms of ALS may seem vague. They can includetripping, dropping things, slurred or \"thick\" speech,and muscle cramping, weakening, and twitching. Somepeople with these early symptoms may tend to assumethat they are normal signs of aging. As the disease pro-gresses, the muscles of the trunk of the body areaffected. Weakness of the breathing muscles developsslowly over months or years. In people with thefamilial form of ALS, loss of function is usually morerapid in the legs, as opposed to in the arms, amongthose with sporadic ALS. For some people, the muscles for speaking, swallowing or breathing are the first to be affected. This is knownas Bulbar ALS. The term \"bulbar\" refers to the motorneurons located in the bulb region of the brain stem,that control the muscles used for chewing, swallowing,and speaking. ALS symptoms, and the order in whichthey occur, vary from one person to another. The rate of muscle loss can vary significantly from person to person, with some patients having longperiods with very slow degeneration. Although theaverage life expectancy from diagnosis is between threeand five years, 20% live more than five years, and 10%live more than 10 years. Being a progressive disease,ALS may spread throughout the body over time, and atsome point in this process, will likely involve themuscles required for breathing. ALS can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages because symptoms may mimic otherconditions. Because today there is not yet an available ALS-specific diagnostic test, other diseases andconditions have to be ruled out first. However, thereare clinical signs that can indicate wasting of motorneurons in either the upper or lower portion of the spine. Doctors familiar with ALS usually see the following signs of lower and upper motor neuron degeneration: Lower Motor neuron degeneration: muscle weakness and atrophy involuntary twitching of muscle fibresSYMPTOMS, SIGNS AND DIAGNOSIS NATIONAL NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE REGISTRY2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 15ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSWHAT IS ALS? SECTION 1 005Disease registries are database tools that provide an opportunity to collect this information to develop a risk profile for a disease or condition, how it develops, and how it responds to treatment and care. In June 2011, a new national registry (the Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (CNDR) for patients with neuromuscular disease was implemented. It will help patients connect with researchers to partici- pate in clinical research that will benefit patients byoffering possible new therapies, treatments and under- standing of their disease. The CNDR is a Canada-wide database of patients who have been diagnosed with a neuromuscular disease. The term \"neuromuscular disease\" refers to a group of more than 40 diseases that affect how muscles and nerves work. ALS is the most prominent of these diseases in adults, and and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common pediatric muscular dystrophy. The Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (CNDR) includes 17 clinics across Canada located in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa, Toronto, London, Kingston, Montreal and Halifax. Why participate in the registry if you have ALS? The Registry is the only means by which valid national epi- demiologic data about ALS can be obtained. Patientswith neuromuscular disease will benefit from this new national registry. The information that will be made available to researchers will lead to a significant increasein the number of studies leading to discovering thecause, treatment and cure of ALS. Finding treatments for neuromuscular diseases has been challenging, as patients are scattered across the country. This registry will allow doctors and researchers to look at medical data from large groups of patients helping them to find bet- ter ways to manage each disease. All patients both adults and children across Canada who have been diagnosed with a neuromuscular disease are able to join the registry. Patients living outside the cities with affiliated clinics, or those not currently seeing a neuro- muscular specialist, can register by contacting the CNDR National Office at the University of Calgary at 1-877-401-4494. The CNDR is supported by the ALS Society of Canada, Jesse's Journey and the Marigold Foundation.For more information about the registry please visit www.cndr.org. It has been well over a century since the first com- plete description of ALS by Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot. Today there is still no cure or effective treatment and the rate of ALS is on the rise. In spite of that painful reality, researchers are making rapid headway in under- standing the complexity of the disease and developing future therapies. The accumulation of knowledge in the basic biology and potential mechanisms involved in ALS, coupled with impressive technological advancements, is accelerating the rate of progress in ALS research. It is commonly held that more advances have been made in the last ten years than in the last one hundred, and the sense of anticipation in the research community is stronger than ever before. Once thought to be a single disease state, ALS is now recognized to have multiple interacting caus-es, all sharing a common pathway leading to the destruction of the motor neurons. By understand- ing the mechanisms that trigger this common path- way, we will ultimately understand ALS. Through such understanding, desperately needed therapeutic options will be developed. Already, new drug and gene thera- pies are in development. Because of the complex nature of ALS, it is thought that a combination of therapeutic strategies to attack the disease at several levels will ultimately provide the means to alter the course of the disease. In this section, we will highlight the potential factors and mechanisms that might play a role in ALS and their relevance to the development of such therapies. In addition to effects on the motor system in the brain, Sanjay Kalra, MD, from University of Alberta's faculty of medicine and dentistry released two stud- ies in 2011 that used advanced imaging to showthat ALS attacks multiple parts of the brain and is not limited to the motor system. Kalra used MRI scans to detect chemical changes that indicate differ- ent aspects of the type of degeneration seen in ALS, including death of neurons and scarring (\"gliosis\"). These advances have significant potential to track ALS and its progression, enabling development of more targeted treatments to slow or prevent the disease inWHAT CAUSES ALS?2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 16ALS.

Environmental Factors The new Registry mentioned above will allow for a potentially superior understanding of the role of envi- ronmental exposures as they relate to ALS. At present we know ALS is age-dependent, and is on the increase as the average age of the population increases. Therole of an environmental factor is much discussed every time clusters of ALS cases have appeared to occur in a particular geographic area or environmental situation. However, isolating specific environmental culprits has proven difficult so far. In the 1940s and '50s, a high incidence of ALS occurred in peoples in three regions in the western pacific: the Chamorros of Guam, the Auyu and Jakai of west New Guinea, and residents of the Kii Peninsula of southern Japan. The incidence in these areas seems to have decreased with Westernization, suggesting an environmental culprit, and dietary toxins have been suggested as a likelycause. A slightly increased rate of ALS also occurs in communities in southwestern Ontario where the water supply comes from regions where there is a major chemical industry. Certain lifestyle factors such as diet, alcohol consump- tion, exercise, and smoking tobacco, and other environ- mental factors such as residence in rural areas, job- related exposure to certain toxins for ALS, physical trauma and pre-existing medical conditions have been studied as risk factors for ALS. To date, epidemiologi- cal research findings suggest that only smoking has shown a strong enough positive association to be con- sidered a \"probable,\" but not yet \"established\" risk fac- tor (Shaw and Strong, 2003). Additional results sup- porting a role for smoking in the development of ALS has been reported (Gallo et al., 2009). A study of exposure to 11 classes of chemicals, or X- rays, provided evidence that there may be an increased risk for ALS with exposure to formaldehyde (Weisskopf et al., 2009). There is a possible increased risk evident in those who have suffered a recent mechanical trauma. An associa- tion with electrical injury has even been postulated. Although no single environmental agent has been shown to directly cause ALS, worldwide epidemiologi- cal studies consistently suggest environmental triggers are important enough to continue to study them in order to better understand the relationships and the new CNDR will help to do just that. Genetic Factors and Inherited Variants of ALS Approximately 90% of ALS cases are sporadic and do not show inheritance. However, scientists assume that for many people who develop ALS. A genetic predis- position may interact with other factors such as envi- ronmental variables to produce the disease. A wide variety of naturally occurring genetic mutations could produce susceptibility to ALS. Every newly identified and located ALS gene provides scientists a piece of the ALS puzzle and creates the opportunity to develop new animal models and cell lines that simulate these genetic abnormalities to iden- tify the mechanisms that may occur in ALS. Even though inherited variants of ALS occur in a small per- centage of ALS patients, these genetic models lend insight into the mechanisms of the disease as a whole. In approximately 10% of people with ALS, the disease is inherited. There are now five different genes in which mutations are believed to be directly causative of ALS: SOD1, angiogenin (ANG), TARDBP, FUS, and FIG4. These genes together account for approxi- mately one-third of all familial ALS cases. Research to identify both categories of genes\u2014directly causative or predisposing\u2014represents a very dynamic field. A website is available which reports the most updated information: http://alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk/reports/reportSummary.aspx In September 2011, a team led by Rosa Rademakers, PhD, from the Mayo Clinic Jacksonville identified the most common genetic cause known to date for ALS and frontotemporal dementia. Results show that a mutation of a single gene, called C9ORF72, accounts 2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 17ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSWHAT IS ALS? SECTION 1 007Presymptomatic testing for ALS-causative gene mutations for adults, who have no symptoms of ALS but do have a family history, is available but controver- sial. It is controversial because of incomplete pene- trance (penetrance is a term used in genetics that describes the extent to which the properties controlled by a gene will be expressed); inability to predict age of onset, the lack of preventive measures or treatments for ALS. For these reasons, getting tested and receiv- ing a positive result (that is, the person does carry the gene) may cause undue stress and anxiety about when ALS symptoms will strike. Testing of children request- ed by parents requires sensitive and understanding counseling. A consensus exists that asymptomatic chil- dren should not be tested as it removes their choice later in life and increases the chance of social stigmati- zation, and could negatively impact educational and career decisions. If you are thinking about genetic testing, ask your neu- rologist about where you can go for genetic coun- selling and testing. You may also self-refer to a genetic counsellor. For more information, visit www.genetests.org. Free Radicals and Oxidative Stress All cells generate toxic metabolites (think of these as the \"exhaust\" from your car and the consequences to yourself and your passengers should your car not be properly vented). In the cell, these \"exhausts\" (\"free radicals\") are a destructive form of oxygen that can also be used by the cell under normal circumstances to fight disease. However, an overproduction of free oxygen radicals can result in cell damage and death.As might be expected, several defenses against such a process exist. A major one is the superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOd-1) discussed above. Mutations in the SOD-1 gene could allow excessivefor nearly 50 per cent of the directly inherited familial ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) in the Finnish population, and more than a third of familial ALS in other groups of European ancestry. Further studies by other groups have found mutations in this gene in individuals with sporadic (i.e., non-hereditary) ALS. Identifying this defective gene provides important insights into the complex interplay between genetic riskfor the disorder and other factors which contribute to disease onset and progression. These insights pave the way for a better understanding of ALS and FTD biology and the therapeutics that can be developed to counteract it. University of British Columbia's Ian MacKenzie, MD,was a key Canadian contributor to the study. Genetic testing of the SOD1 gene, and the other 4 genes mentioned above, is commercially available. Testing for mutations in the SOD1 gene is appropriate in any patient with ALS who has another affected member or an incomplete family history. Molecular genetic testing could clarify mode of inheritance (i.e., autosomal domi- nant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked dominant deter- mined by family history) and modify risk assessment for genetic counseling as well as perhaps indicating disease prognosis. Testing at other known genetic loci is usually carried out for research purposes only. Even though some additional loci have been identified, the majority of cases of inherit- ed ALS remain unexplained. There are research projects that seek blood samples from persons with familial ALS to further their work in identifying more genetic loci and better understand the disease process. Ask your neurolo- gist for more information about these studies. Genetic testing should always be accompanied by formal genetic counselling. Genetic counselling is the process of providing individuals and families with infor- mation on the nature, inheritance, and implications of genetic disorders to help them make informed medical and personal decisions. Genetic counsellors are specially trained professionals who use family history and genetic testing results to clarify genetic risk for other family mem- bers and help you weigh the pros and cons of testing. Even though inherited variants of ALS occur in a small percentage of ALS patients, these genetic models lend insight into the mechanisms of the disease as a whole.2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 18ALS.

Neurotrophic Factors These important factors for the growth and mainte- nance of motor neurons in humans have been shown to enhance motor neuron survival in cell cul- ture experiments and in mice with a variety of motor neuron disorders. Although it is not clear how deficien- cies of neurotrophic factors may affect human motor neurons, several attempts have been made to determine whether neurotrophic factors can slow the rate of pro- gression of ALS by first testing these agents in animal models of the disease. neurotrophic factors were the first important cate- gory of molecules tested in large-scale clinical trialsof ALS. These included brain derived neurotrophic fac- tor (BDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). While these trials were not successful, it became clear that the question of delivering therapeutic reagents to motor neurons is a tremendous challenge which needs to be addressed. Recently, three other promising neurotrophic factors, glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), andinsulin-like growth factor (IGF1), have shown promise in ALS mouse models. By developing drugs to manipulate the interactions of neurotrophic factors, researchers hope to learn about and gain some control over this potential aspect of ALS. Altered Protein and Neurofilament Metabolism Advances in technology in the field of protein research have opened up new avenues into understanding the pro- tein mechanisms involved in ALS. Mass spectrome- try, which enables scientists to detect which proteins are present in an extremely small sample, has become very advanced. Mass spectrometry is also providing researchers with the tools to develop a desperately needed simple, rapid test to diagnose ALS by identifying pro- teins generated through the course of the disease.Powerful electron microscopy reveals the configuration and behaviour of proteins. Such technological advance- ments provide insights into how proteins fold and unfold and interact with their environment.free radical reactions, damaging the neuron. Canadian researchers have documented the existence of excessive levels of proteins damaged by free oxygen radicals within neurons in ALS, suggesting that either the neu- ron synthesizes excessive levels of free radicals, or that it is incapable of detoxifying those that are normally produced. In healthy individuals, special enzymes protect cells from dangerous free radicals. But malformed enzymes, such as those found in ALS, may have the opposite effect, in essence initiating damage rather than protecting against attack by dangerous free radicals, in a twisted game of molecular tag. Neil Cashman, MD, and colleagues at the University of British Columbia reported in 2011 on their use of a truncated enzyme and special antibodies to analyze the folding and misfolding of a key protein. The goal is to create new proteins with binding capacity to act as a \"sticky patch\" where \"bad\" enzymes can attach and be removed from the system. With further development, these proteins have the potential to block unhealthy interactions, thereby stopping disease pro- gression in its tracks. Therapies geared to reducing oxidative stress are in development, including gene therapy and new pharma- cotherapy. The properties of certain foods and vita- mins are also studied for their ability to reduce free rad- icals. Vitamin E's antioxidant properties made it the prescribed therapy for people with ALS one hundred years ago and it still is today, although with little effect in hindering the course of the disease. Immunological Factors In recent years, researchers have considered how injured motor neurons might spur an inflammato- ry response that could contribute to, and even per- petuate, a cascade of cell death in the nervous sys- tem. The immune cells of the nervous system, called microglial cells and astrocytes, can respond to neural injury in a way that can be either beneficial or harmful. This microglial response which begins as a localized inflammatory reaction, has been implicated as a trigger of cell death pathways in motor neurons. While a mechanism that serves as a response to regional cell injury is useful on the small scale to clear away dam- age, it can become devastating on a large scale as2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 19ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSWHAT IS ALS? SECTION 1 009Glutamate Excitotoxicity Abnormalities in the handling of excitatory amino acids by the nervous system, particularly glutamate, may be critical to the occurrence of ALS. Through damageto the normal \"transporter\" mechanisms by which glu- tamate is removed from the nervous system, excessiveglutamate accumulates. When glutamate binds at neu-ronal receptors, there is an influx of calcium ions into the cell. The motor neurons may not be able to deal with the excessive levels of calcium flooding in, result- ing in damage. Researchers are investigating ways tohelp the nervous system handle calcium and glutamate. Riluzole, the single drug currently available for the treatment of ALS, shows very modest results. Its action is not well understood but is thought to somehow affect glutamate mechanisms. Clearly, there is a critical need to find treatments toeffectively slow the progression of ALS, or cure it completely. However, with today's quickly advancingscientific technologically, the odds of finding effective treatments for ALS are better than ever before. Drug and Clinical Trials Medications used to treat a disease are based on theresults of laboratory and clinic-based research studies, or trials. Drugs are first developed in the laboratoryusing technological methods and animal model testing to see if the treatment has an effect on the disease process. Treatments that show promise then need to be studied on actual patients with the disease in a clini- cal setting to test for drug delivery efficiency (i.e., what is the best way to give the medicine?), safety(i.e., how well is it tolerated and at what dosage?), and effi- cacy(i.e., is the drug actually changing the expected course of the disease in patients receiving the drug as compared to others who are not and to what degree is there a difference?). While not all clinical trials are successful at identifying new, acceptable treat- ment, they nevertheless help to answer research questions and move research in a forward direc- tion. Clinical trials are subject to stringent research protocols for the protection of human subjects. From time to time there may be an opportunity for you to participateA signature feature of ALS is the accumulation of neurofilaments and other proteins in the motor neu- rons. NFs are believed to be responsible for maintaining the normal neuronal structure and shape. Studies making use of transgenic models to alter neurofilamentexpression reveal that abnormalities in the proportion of neurofila- ments, or the way in which neurofilaments interact with each other -- or with other proteins, could play a role in the development of ALS. Peripherin, ubiquitin and the recently identified TDP-43 and FUS proteins are all being investigated for their roles in aggregate formation in ALS. Many other types of cellular proteins and enzymes may play a role in ALS. Protein kinases are enzymes within the brain and spinal cord that regulate many cellular functions. Studies have revealed that abnormal levels of protein kinases exist in the nerve tissue of people who died of ALS. By examin- ing this tissue in mouse models, researchers are investigat- ing how skewed levels of these important regulatory enzymes may trigger cell death in the motor neurons in the hope of finding a way to normalize the protein kinase ratios to prevent cell death from triggering. By studying the spinal cords of people who died from ALS, Dr. Jean-Pierre Julien's team at Laval University in 2011 discovered an overproduction of a protein called TDP-43 in their nerve tissues. This protein can play a key role: when it is \"overexpressed,\" it exaggerates the inflammatory response that increases the vulnerability of nerve cells to toxic molecules that circulate in the body. The team is testing an inhibitor that could lead to the development of drugs to reduce this inflammation and partially restore the neuromuscular function. Proteosomes and protein chaperones are cellular sys- tems that shuttle proteins and digest them into their basic components in order to clear away damaged proteins in the cell. Researchers are investigating these systems in mouse models and cell lines to understand their role in the pathogenesis of ALS and how they might be used therapeutically to hinder the disease. By studying the proteins affected by genetic muta- tions in familial ALS, and the behaviour and interactions of the proteins involved in aggregate formation in motor neuron cells, researchers are gaining a better under- standing of the role of abnormal protein mecha- nisms in ALS.

To learn more about the clinical trial process, refer to Fact Sheet: Clinical Trials\u2014A Primer . This fact sheet can be downloaded from the ALS Society of Canada web site, www.als.ca . The Fact Sheet covers why trials are important, the four phases of trials, how trials work, who conducts them, safety issues, risks and bene- fits, informed consent, and questions to ask your doctor. In 2008, ALS clinicians from 15 centres across Canada incorporated into a group called CALS (Canadian con- sortium for clinical research and trials). As a group, CALS aims to bring clinical trials to ALS patients across Canada. Their first clinical trial to test the efficacy of lithium was carried out in partnership with a similar consortium from the eastern U.S. - NEALS. The study began in January 2009 and investigators were asked to halt the study following an interim data analysis in September 2009. While the results from the lithium clinical trial were disappointing in that the study was not able to duplicate the survival benefits seen in the original pilot study, the CALS centres continue to be sites of clinical trials for a number of promising ALS treat- ments. Currently, a stage 3 trial is in progress to study the efficacy of ceftriaxone , to see if it prolongs survival and/or slows decline in function in patients living with ALS. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic in the class of cephalosporins that is approved to treat certain types of infections. Ceftriaxone may hold potential for ALS because the drug may also increase the level of a protein that decreases the level of glutamate - a potentially toxic nervous system messenger - near nerves, thereby pro- tecting motor neurons from injury. Enrolment for this trial has been met. For more information on this trial: http://www.als.ca/en/research/clinical-trials/stage-3- ceftriaxone-clinical-trial-begins A Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokintetics of dexpramipexole in patients with ALS is also underway in Canada. Six CALS centres are involved to study the effect of this compounds' neuro protective properties on slowing functional decline and extending survival. This multi-national trial is also being conducted in the US, Europe, and Australia. Enrolmentfor this trial has been met.

Others prefer toavoid a win-or-lose approach, and instead deal withthings day by day. An ALS diagnosis has the power to strengthen healthy family relationships, or shatter already weak ones. Itcan unpredictably bring out the best in some peopleand in others, awaken emotions they cannot manage.To help you cope and instill hope, the ALS Society ishere for you and your family (Section 3). This sectionis intended to give you suggestions for personal cop-ing, as well as tips for others around you who will alsobe going through changes with you. Section 4, sub- section Approaching End-of-Life Issues and Advance Planning, and Section 6 Legal and Financial Issues also provide information that may help you and yourfamily to cope with changes and planning ahead. Social workers, psychologists, counsellors, and support groups can be very helpful. You can learn from those who are familiar with what you are going through,share understanding with others who have thesame challenges as you, and learn how peoplewith more advanced ALS are dealing with issuesyou might face in the future. The ALS Society, hos- pices, and other organizations provide these types ofservices to help provide social and emotional supportthroughout the course of the disease. One's life with ALS can be looked upon as a series of progressive functional losses, but it can also be a unique opportunity for enrichment. The choice isyours. If you choose enrichment, it can take many forms. The choices are very personal.

It should be the first step in making the most of your life withALS. There is much that can be done to help you live aproductive and enjoyable life. Be positive but do nottrivialize the situation. It isn't helpful to pretend thateverything will be fine or that ALS is not a very seriouscondition. On the other hand, there is no need to dwell on the negative aspects of the disease. Twenty percent ofpeople with ALS live more than five years and nearly10% live ten years or more. You could be one of thosepeople. And thankfully, neurological research is mov-ing steadily ahead, so no one knows when a break-through may occur...it could be sooner than later.These facts give hope and hope is a crucial part of life.Achieving a balance between hope and realism is diffi-cult at times, but something we all must learn to do. If you are a person with ALS who has decided to take charge of your condition, here are a few practical things you should consider doing without delay: 1. Contact your family doctorWhen doctors find out that one of their patients has ALS, some might say there is nothing they can do tohelp. In fact, they probably can help but they don'tknow it! If your doctor hasn't already done so, requestthat he or she refer you to the nearest ALS Clinic orALS Rehab team. Your doctor will also be able to helpyou in other ways in the future, such as signing yourapplication for a CPP disability pension, and theCanadian Revenue Agency (CRA) Disability Tax CreditCertificate for your annual tax deduction, or byapproving your application for home care. You should also suggest that your doctor access theresources from the ALS Society by requesting a copyof this manual or other information the ALS Society makes available. Also encourage your doctor to rely onspecialists and therapists associated with an ALS clinicor centre for consultations and advice. You also need to discuss with your family doctor his or her availabilityto do home visits as ALS progresses. 2. Register with the ALS Society The ALS Society provides various services to assist people with ALS. Let your local provincial ALS Societyknow that you are a person with ALS in their area, andthat you would like to register with them and receiveany helpful information they provide. 3. Apply for a disabled Parking PermitYour local city or provincial government will issue a disabled parking permit to people with ALS. Get theapplication through your local ALS Society or ALSClinic. 4. Obtain a Medic Alert BraceletA Medic Alert bracelet can be useful to tell others about your condition, in the event that you are unableto speak. This may be particularly useful for those withBulbar symptoms who are unable to speak or haveslurred speech. For further information and an orderform call the Canadian Medic Alert Foundation at 1-800-668-1507. 5.

They may feel guiltythat youhave ALSand they are healthy. Theymay also be short-tem-pered because of theextra daily responsibili-ties that they face -banking, raising childrenwith less help from you, morechores - all this in addition to thecare they give you. They may feel that it is notfair and then feel guilty about reacting this way. Keeping the lines of communication open is the best way to work out these feelings. Talk openly to your family about how you feel. Encourage them toshare their feelings with you. If this is hard to do, itmay be useful to talk with a social worker or othermember of your ALS team. He or she may be able tohelp you and your family to solve communicationproblems. It is most important that you have someoneto talk to who will not be upset by what you are saying.The person you need may be one of your healthcareprofessionals, a friend or a family member. Members of your immediate family will likely become involved in your daily care and assistance. Most peoplewith ALS remain in the home for as long as possible,and the demands upon family members can be great.Your primary \"informal\" caregivers, such as yourspouse, partner or grown children, may find that yourcare, especially in the later stages of the disease, is tak-ing up most of their lives. It is natural for them towant to give all that they can to help you, but there should be limits to self-sacrifice. Caregivers must continue to have lives of their own and take care of themselves. Spending time in the company of friends or family who are not sick, in the pursuit of hobbies or activities in addition to care giv-ing, or quiet time alone are important refreshers. These periods of respite allow caregivers to recoverfrom the stresses of care giving and make them moreeffective, balanced helpers. Do not hesitate to askTips and Advice:other family members to fill in for your primary care-giver while he or she takes regular breaks or, if possi-ble, arrange for paid help. A social worker or ALSSociety representative may be able to help you identify respite services and any available funding arrangements. The needs of a caregiver tend to take a back seat to the needs of the sick person. It is hard to have a serious illness, but it is also difficult to care for someone with one. Most peo- ple, sick or well, feel a combination of some or all of the following emotions at dif- ferent times when dealing with illness. Most important-ly, no one should feel guilty about any of these feel-ings. They are perfectly normal and to be expected. Commonly experienced emotions in both the initial and longer terms are: Initial emotions: Curiosity Love Closeness and openness to others Hope Disbelief Loss Anticipatory grief Guilt Erosion of trust Denial Responsibility Long-term emotions: Persistence Hope Love Appreciation of the value of life and of others Sadness Guilt Loneliness Jealousy Annoyance Feeling trapped Feeling overwhelmedSee the following Fact Sheets (available to download at www.als.ca/media/als_fact_sheet.aspx) and the Resource Section for helpful books and web sites. first Steps for families: For families of those recently diagnosed with ALS Ways to Help: Assisting Families living With ALS ALS.

The feelings of adults and children in upsetting situa- tions are quite similar. Anger, helplessness, fear, hope,and despair are commonly experienced. Children, how-ever, have fewer ways of expressing their emotions anddealing with them. Younger children tend not to expressthemselves in words and will act out their feelings.Older children can find it hard to talk about how theyfeel, and teenagers often do not have friends withwhom they can talk about serious situations. For children of all ages, feelings can be expressed through emotional and behavioural changes. Childrenmay have questions that they may be afraid to askbecause everyone is so upset, and they do not knowhow to find things out by themselves. Although manypeople feel that children should be protected from sick-ness, this does not help the child. The child will knowthat something is wrong and will get upset anyway. ALS.

Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSCOPING WITH ALS SECTION 2 0016Talking to Children When dealing with children experiencing sickness and big changes in their families and lives, it is necessary to explain everything as fully as possible. Because adults tend not to explain to children what is happening, children often blame themselves for the sadness in the house and feel very guilty. They may want to know what exactly it is that the sick person has, whether they can catch it too, what will happen to the sick person, and whether that person will die. These questions should be answered as positively as possible.For example, instead of telling the child that a person is very sick or dying, something like: \"Well, they are not doing very well right now, but the doctors say that there are still things we can do. We can.....\" gives hope without being dishonest. Children should know that they can ask questions and that someone will try to answer them. If their parents do not feel able to talk to them, then a relative,friend, or doctor should make sure that the child knows that someone is always available to talk, not only about the illness but also about anything that isworrying the child. A major concern of children is often what will happen if the sick person becomes very sick or dies. They may want to know if they will have to move, who will look after them, if they will have to give up their favourite things, change schools, and so on. They may be afraid to ask about these things, so they should be reassured and told about any planned changes before a crisis interrupts their normal routine. Very young children may be upset by what is going on, but will probably not be able to understand your expla- nation. Giving them lots of hugs, love and attention helps until they are old enough to understand the situa- tion in more detail. Whatever transpires, do your best to keep the children involved and feel secure. Do not hesitate to turn to members of your healthcare team or the ALS Society for advice or help when you need it. The web site www.alsindependence.com has excellent information on how to explain ALS to chil- dren of various ages.Final Note on Coping... ALS, like many chronic diseases affect the person with the diagnosis and those around them. Each person needs support and resources to learn, accept, and cope with the changes. The Resource Section at the end of the Manual includes many books, videos, and web sites that may be helpful to you. Because ALS is a progres- sive condition, change is on-going. Therefore, tools to help you cope may be useful at various points in time when you are living with ALS.Long-term ways to help children cope... ...Pay adequate attention to children of parents with ALS. This may mean asking a grandparent or other family member or close friend to help you with this. ...Explain to children that a change in appear- ance does not mean the sick person's feelings toward them have changed. Protect children from the emotional swings of the sick person, if mood changes are occurring. ...Allow children respite, too. Like caregivers, they need a break to enjoy themselves. ...Continue to encourage children to expresstheir feelings. 2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 28The ALS Society of Canada was founded in 1977 as a national non-profit, charitable organ- ization dedicated solely to providing a variety of services to people with ALS and their families.

This Neuromuscular Research Partnership (NRP) works with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to fund excellent and rele- vant research. Only the most promising projects by the finest scien- tists are funded and, over the years, this strategy has been rewarded with significant advances in our knowl- edge of ALS. With the acceleration of results because of advances in neurology and other areas of science, we know that effective therapies and a cure are now, more than ever, within reach. To learn about the kind of research the ALS Society is funding, see: www.als.ca/research/our-research-program. Providing Support Support programs such as equipment loan programs, support groups, and other client support services are provided at the provincial level. Available services vary by province.

Although ALS is a degenerative dis-ease, the rate at which neurons and muscles degenerate is unpredictable and varies greatly from oneindividual to another. In some cases the disease seemsto have reached a plateau, while in others it reaches astandstill for varying lengths of time. Also, ALS canprogress steadily at a rapid or slow rate. Whatever therate of muscle degeneration, you should remain asactive as possible, without causing fatigue in affectedmuscles. It also helps to focus on what you can do, rather than on what you can't do. In order to remain as functional as possible for as long as possible, you will need a supportive, patient-centredhealthcare team who understands ALS, your personalsituation, and the options that will be available to you.As time goes by you will need to work with yourhealthcare providers to treat various symptoms of ALSand adapt to an array functional changes.

There are a number of ALS clinics across Canada that care for patients with ALS throughan interdisciplinary team approach. You very well mayhave received your definitive diagnosis of ALS in oneof these clinics. In other communities, the samehealthcare professionals may be available in privatepractice or through homecare community programs.Contact information for clinics and centres in Canada specializing in ALS management can befound on our web site, www.als.ca , or by calling the ALS Society of Canada at 1-800-267-4257. Even if you visit an ALS clinic for periodic team fol- low-up and assessment, you will still need servicesfrom healthcare professionals in your community.Please ask the clinic coordinator at the ALS centrewhere you go for care to send your family doctor acopy of the CD-ROM, Guide to ALS Care for Primary Care Physicians. If you have chosen not to go to a spe- cialty ALS clinic/centre for care, please contact yourlocal Provincial ALS Society and ask them to send thisresource to your doctor on your behalf.

This is accom- plished through the following: teaching by demonstration; ongoing assessment/evaluation; ordering appropriate equipment in a timely manner; preventing complications; utilizing community resources; providing psychological support. The OT is generally more concerned with fine-motorcontrol and how movement will affect function. TheOT's tasks may include the following: assessing fine-motor functional abilities (for example, hand use); evaluating positioning and seating requirements; assisting in choosing and accessing suitable augmen-tative mobility and communications strategies andany required assistive devices; giving instruction to the person with ALS, familymembers, and caregivers on exercise, positioning,correct body mechanics for lifting and transferring,and use of assistive devices; teaching energy conservation and time managementtechniques; providing information about modifications to homeand other environments to enhance mobility andsafety. The PT is generally more concerned with gross-motor function and anatomical impairments associated withabnormal movement. The PT's tasks may include thefollowing: providing a detailed analysis of abnormal movement (for example, gait analysis-how you walk); optimizing the person's strength, function, and com-fort; designing and monitoring a therapeutic exercise regi-men when appropriate; assisting with breathing management; providing training in energy conservation and timemanagement techniques; preventing needless purchases of unsuitable equip-ment; making a home assessment.Neurologist Your doctor will refer you to a neurologist, a specialist in diseases of the nervous system who can confirm adiagnosis of ALS. Between them they will: outline types of treatment options available; encourage the setting of short-term goals; help you preserve a positive self-image and maintain your morale; work with you to identify specific needs and concernsand refer you to therapists who may be able to findsolutions. Palliative Care Doctor A doctor with special training in pain management and other care aimed at improving comfort and quality oflife for patients with incurable diseases is a palliativecare specialist. One may be a member of your ALSteam. If there is no palliative care specialist as aregular member of the clinic team you see at the ALSclinic/centre, you may eventually consult with one atsome point in your disease. This type of doctor is alsowell trained in talking with patients about care deci-sions, including end-of-life issues. Nurse ClinicianA nurse clinician generally formulates nursing goals after analyzing assessment data, then draws up andimplements a care plan. Other nursing functions mayinclude the following: explaining terminology and techniques; teaching skills and providing demonstrations; evaluating skill levels and reviewing procedures; addressing questions and concerns; ensuring the comfort of people living with ALS; encouraging and promoting decision-making by the people with ALS and their families; liaising with community organizations; making referrals; limiting the development of complications; providing nursing interventions if problems arise.

Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.0021ALS DISEASE MANAGEMENT SECTION 4A Manual for People Living with ALSThe physiatrist, a medical doctor specializing in physical and rehabilitative medicine, generally evaluates the extent of disability and functioning, and gauges the level of muscle function you still have (residual level). On the basis of these findings, treatment plans may be designed. Other functions may include: recommending preventive and supportive treatment; preventing complications; determining which diagnostic tests are necessary; helping maintain maximum function and quality of life; consulting with therapists concerning orthoses and equipment. Dietitian A dietitian's primary considerations are to keep your quality of life as high as possible by maintaining safe and adequate nutrition and hydration, in order to pre- vent life-threatening nutritional deficits from develop- ing. The dietitian may assess or evaluate the following: functional abilities (ability to self-feed or to administer tube feedings); nutritional status and present intake. The dietitian may recommend the following strategies: appropriate changes in food texture and consistency; appropriate methods of food preparation; substitutions for hard-to-manage foods; meals of a manageable size and frequency; strategies for maximizing nutritional intake. Respiratory Therapist and Respirologist The respiratory therapist generally devises strategies to optimize remaining muscle function and reduce dis- comfort, and institutes a program of chest care if nec- essary. In some locations, the physiotherapist may be the person who helps you with exercises to promote airway clearance and cough techniques. Other tasks may include: evaluating pulmonary function status; maintaining pulmonary hygiene (airway clearance); providing suggestions for managing decreasing breathing function; offering information on body positioning, energy con-servation, relaxation, and compensatory techniques to improve breath support for nutrition and for speech; setting up a home ventilation program if appropriate; making suggestions about a course of action to take when respiratory failure occurs. The respirologist is a medical doctor who specializes in care for the respiratory system. During the course of ALS you may be referred to or seen by a respirologist in the event of a respiratory infection, or when you decide you are interested in mechanical ventilation. Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) A speech-language pathologist provides advice on tech- niques and strategies to allow the person with ALS to continue to communicate throughout life. Some func- tions of the speech-language pathologist may include: evaluating the individual's motivation and potential for learning new techniques; evaluating functional abilities, such as oral motor function, cognitive-linguistic function, augmentative communication function, and swallowing function; determining the most efficient communication func- tion; training people with ALS and family members in tech- niques of effective communication and energy con- servation, and safe eating, drinking and swallowing techniques. Social Worker In addition to other healthcare professionals, you may be referred to a social worker. The social worker's tasks include both practical assistance as well as emotional support to help people with ALS and their families cope with everyday life. The social worker offers: emotional support and counselling to the person with ALS and to family members and refers to the appro- priate service agency if ongoing support is required; an understanding of the emotional impact of an ALS diagnosis and assists with the psychological adjust- ments that come with this diagnosis; information about available community resources and acts as an advocate to assist people in accessing these resources; information on legal and financial issues and assists people to access these resources in their own commu- nities; and2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 33ALS.

Because this could become dangerous, get advice from your doctor and other healthcare professionals about how to address this problem. There are things you can do regarding how you eat and what you eat that can lower the risk of getting food stuck in your throat. If you are beginning to notice problems with swallowing, see your doctor for a referral for a swallow study. Choking is an alarming symptom. Many people assume that choking to death is how people with ALS die. This has been shown to be false. Choking is a manageable symptom, and most people with ALS die peacefully. Build-up of Saliva and drooling People with Bulbar ALS often develop an excessive drooling problem because they have difficulty swal- lowing the normal production of saliva. An increase in the actual production of saliva may occur as a side-effect of tube feeding diets. Your doctor can offer various medications to limit saliva production to reduce this problem. Saliva and Mucus in the Lungs Should muscles involved in breathing (diaghram) and coughing (abdominal and intercostals) weaken, it becomes difficult to cough up saliva and mucus. If you are having this problem, see your doctor as soon as possible. There is a technique for freeing saliva and mucus from the throat and lungs, which involves lying on a slope with your head on the down side so that the saliva flows down when the technique is applied. This technique should be taught by a trained professional who is familiar with and can demonstrate the correct position and procedures. This is especially important if you are experiencing shortness of breath.See Adapting to Swallowing Problems and Maintaining Good Nutrition sub-section. See Maintaining Oral Health sub-section.

FOREVER.0023ALS DISEASE MANAGEMENT SECTION 4A Manual for People Living with ALSAlthough there are no known medications that will cure ALS, there are medical treatments, therapies, and assistive devices which help people maintain active and independent lives for as long as possible. These disease management and adaptive strate- gies promote the well-being of both you and your family. Communicate openly with your care- givers, therapists, and doctors about your symptoms and challenges so that you can work together to find solutions that work best for you in a timely manner. Some of the problems associated with ALS and the strategies for managing them are discussed in more detail in the additional topic specific sub-sections. When you decide you are ready to learn more about these topics or you are experiencing problems in these areas, the information will be available for you. Mouth and Throat Problems Speaking and Swallowing As mentioned before, when the onset symptoms of ALS are speaking or swallowing problems, it is known as Bulbar ALS. For other people with ALS, these problems don't generally occur until the later phases of the disease. People with Bulbar ALS are vulnerable to signifi- cant weight loss, and should consider a feeding tube in the earlier phases of the disease. Generally speaking, when you have lost 10-15% of your \"nor- mal\" body weight, your doctor should talk to you about the option of a feeding tube while you are fairly healthy. For those who do lose their ability to speak, there is now a range of communication aids available from low-tech to very high-tech. OVERVIEW OF ALS DISEASE MANAGEMENT ISSUES2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 35Also, a suction unit can help remove saliva from the mouth and prevent it from flowing back into the lungs. Coughing Coughing can occur for more than one reason. For example the lungs can clear a passage by automatically and unexpectedly forcing out air, while at the same time irritations in the throat due to blockage can also cause unexpected coughing. People with ALS may develop weak coughs due to breathing muscle weak- ness which makes it difficult to effectively clear airways that may be blocked. Talk to your doctor or respirato- ry therapist about techniques to produce an effectivecough. If you do not have a respiratory therapist, your physiotherapist may be able to assist you. Symptoms that Affect Daily Living Eating Continue to feed yourself as long as possible.However, if you feel too weak to manage a whole meal by yourself, or have trouble with muscle control to operate knives, forks and spoons, ask for help from your caregiver. For instance, your caregiver could helpa lot just by cutting your food for you. An occu-pational therapist can also help by showing you how to adapt your eating utensils so they are easier to grip, or adjust the height of your eating surface so you haveless distance between the plate and your mouth. When swallowing difficulties arise, or jaw muscles involved in chewing are weakened or stiff, your dieti- tian will be able to help you with how to eat, what to eat, and how to modify food textures to make eating easier and safer. When difficulty with eating is accom- panied by weight loss, you should talk to your doctor about the possibility of tube feeding. See Adapting to Changes in Breathing and Maintaining Lung Health sub-section. Constipation Constipation may occur as a result of inactivity or lack of adequate fibre or water in the diet. For those using tube feeding, it may be especially difficult getting suffi- cient fibre and hydration. In either case, if you are experiencing constipation, ask a dietitian about ways to add more fibre to your diet. If adding fibre to your diet doesn't solve the problem, see a doctor about an appropriate medication. fatigue Fatigue occurs as a result of weakening muscles, sus- pected higher metabolic functioning in ALS patients, and declining breathing function. One of the first ways you can combat fatigue is to conserve your ener- gy for really important tasks or activities that you really enjoy. An occupational therapist can plan a daily rou- tine with you that will help you to adapt to life with ALS. Some tasks can be done in different ways that will save some of your energy. There are a large num- ber of aids that can help you to do the things you now find difficult. It is essential that you consult your thera- pist before buying an aid to avoid expensive mistakes. If you tend to wake up in the morning feeling very fatigued and light headed, discuss this with your doctor promptly as you may not be breathing well enough in the night, thus requiring a respiratory func- tion evaluation and some airway management strate- gies. Getting to Sleep and Positional Problems Some people with ALS may become immobile. People who are unable to move get very uncomfortable lying in the same position while sleeping for several hours. There are special beds, which help an immobile person sleep without being manually turned during the night. A satin bottom sheet and nightwear also facilitates turning. Getting to sleep can also be problematic for some peo- ple. Talk to your doctor about relaxation exercises you could use to try to get to sleep. If medication is required to help you sleep, be mindful that use ofSeeAdapting to Swallowing Problems and Maintaining Good Nutrition sub-section.

Use of Alcohol and Medication If you are taking any medications, be very careful about drinking alcohol. The combination of alcoholand many medications can cause serious problems.This is not always predictable. For example, alcoholwith some medications, such as a simple cough remedy,even taken several hours apart, can restrict a person'sability to breathe, and at the same time cause a cough-ing spell, both lasting for hours. Also, reduced motorcontrol can be accentuated by alcohol. If you like tohave the occasional alcoholic beverage, talk to yourdoctor about the specific risks that may be involved. Uncontrollable Emotions Uncontrollable emotions such as excessive laughing orcrying may be experienced by some people with ALS.This is called emotional lability or pseudobulbar affect(PBA), and can be particularly frustrating. PBA is acondition that affects 15-45 per cent of people withALS. PBA is characterized by sudden, involuntary out-bursts of laughing or crying that do not match theindividual's actual feelings. The reactions may be mis-understood by other people complicating matters.PBA usually catches people by surprise when it firsthappens; however, over time many people learn how tomodify these emotional outbreaks and how to avoidsome of the situations that trigger them. If you areexperiencing this problem, talk to your doctor about medications that may help control it. The FDA recent- ly approved a drug for PBA, called Nuedexta. It is amixture of the cough suppressant dextromethorphanand quinidine, which is used to treat heart arrhythmias.It is expected to be available by prescription in early2011. People with PBA may also be helped by antide- pressant drugs. Cognitive and Behavioural Changes Until fairly recently, it was assumed that ALS did not affect thinking. However, researchers have found thatSee Section 5 Assistive Equipment section and Adapting to Breathing Changes and Maintaining Lung Function sub-section. ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.0025ALS DISEASE MANAGEMENT SECTION 4A Manual for People Living with ALSchanges in the way one thinks, perceives, and processesinformation (cognition), and behaves will occur insome patients with ALS and sometimes early in thedisease before an ALS diagnosis has been made. Thisis not to say these changes will occur in all personswith ALS and the exact nature of the changes can varyfrom person to person. You and your family can betteridentify any such changes and discuss effective man-agement strategies with your ALS healthcare teammembers if you are educated about them. Propermanagement may lessen the impact of cognitive andbehavioural changes on daily living and coping withALS. The following may indicate changes in thinking: Reduced reasoning, insight, and problem-solvingability Deficits in verbal fluency (reduced word recognitionand word choice) Some of the following symptoms of personality and behavioural changes may be experienced: Apathy Loss of inhibition Restlessness or overactivity Social inappropriateness Mood swings Compulsive rituals such as repeatedly dressing, usingthe bathroom, eating, hoarding, etc. For more information about cognitive, personality, or behavioural changes in ALS, consult with an ALS specialist. Mobility Joint and Muscle Pain Persons with ALS who lose significant muscle function in areas that involve joints may end up not using those jointsto their full capacity. Lack of use can cause stiffness andjoint pain. Range-of-motion exercises are designed to prevent these joint problems. Careful attention to your exercise regime, whether active (doing it yourself) or pas-sive (with assistance), will eliminate much potential jointpain. However, there are still a number of common painsthat can develop. If your arms are weak and you allowthem to hang unsupported from the shoulder, there is atendency for the shoulder joint to become painful.

There are a variety of products designed to assistyou with weakened grip strength. If these weaknesses continue to develop, you can lose your ability to hold even lighter weight articles. Gettingdressed and undressed becomes more and more difficult,and then impossible to do alone. As this process occurs,dressing can be made easier with Velcro fasteners, elasticwaistbands, and other features that make clothing easier toput on and take off. Cold or hot hands can weaken the grip of most people. For persons with ALS, however, this is even more pro-nounced. If your fingers get cold you will probably be sur-prised by how much harder it is to do such things as undobuttons, or turn a doorknob. An occupational therapistwill be able to help you with specific strategies. Some OTsspecialize in hand movement and therapy. As ALS progresses, there are various types of equipment available to assist you with your mobility needs. Withrespect to moving about, some may need a cane or a walk-er at first, then a manual wheelchair, followed by a powerwheelchair to assist in maintaining a certain level of inde-pendence. Also, there are raised chairs and toilet seatswhich are easier to get up from, and portable hoists tomove a person Regarding eating, there are eating utensilsthat can assist and increase independence - cutlery withlarge easy-grip handles, non-slip mats and special plasticplates.

It is advised that you get advice from a healthcare professional such as anoccu.pational or physiotherapist before acquiring assistiveequipment. helpful to support weak arms whenever possible on pil-lows, armrests or on a table. A shoulder sling will also give the arm some support and decrease strain on the shoulder joint while you are walking.Hip pain can result from prolonged sitting in a saggingseat or chair. A firm seat on a regular chair or wheelchairwill relieve strain on the hip joints. Leg and foot Swelling If your lower limb mobility is reduced, you may experi-ence mild leg and foot swelling, which is best reduced bymoving the toes and ankle, if possible, and by elevatingthe leg and/or using an elastic stocking. Talk to a nurseabout how best to address this problem. Muscle Cramping Cramps are not uncommon in people with ALS. They canbe alleviated to some extent by keeping the affected mus-cle warm and by stretching it or having your caregiverstretch it until the pain is eased. Severe or frequent crampsshould be discussed with your doctor. There are a numberof medications available to reduce cramping. Changes to Posture If the muscles that maintain your upward posture weaken,you may have discomfort in your lower back, neck andshoulder blade region. Special cushions, chair backs, lum-bar (lower back) and cervical (neck) rolls are available tohelp you to maintain correct sitting posture. It may be nec-essary for you to sit in a reclined position or to use a neckcollar to maintain proper positioning. Your occupationaltherapist can assist you in choosing the right device. difficulty Walking If you experience weakening leg and ankle muscles andunexpected fatigue, tripping and falling become problems.When these problems occur you should consider using legand ankle splint devices ( ankle foot orthoses-AfOs ) that provide added support to weakened muscles, or a cane or walker as soon as you are threatened by unexpected falls.Some people are self-conscious about having to use walk-ing aids, or see it as an announcement that their conditionis worsening.

Sexual desires and abilities may not be affected by the dis- ease process, except for the physical limitations imposed by physical discomfort, muscle weakness, fatigue or low energy levels, or medication side-effects. A person with ALS may worry about not being able to please a healthy partner. For men, anxiety may cause impotence. Other factors that may contribute to unsatisfactory sexual relations are: Adjustment to assistive devices or support systems Dealing with everyday survival Negative self-image Reduced independence with self-grooming Reduced communication ability Limited mobility Changes in physical appearance Altered role Emotional state Functional level You and your partner may want counselling with an empa- thetic professional to openly deal with mutual concerns and expectations. If you are both willing, you could explore different sexual techniques, role flexibility, and alternative methods of sexual expression. The following suggestions may prove helpful in dealing with sexual concerns: Using techniques, assistive devices, and positioning to accommodate increasing muscle weakness and other symptoms of ALS Identifying techniques and assistive devices that enable you to maintain good groom- ing and personal cleanliness Maintaining communication (the open expression of affec- tion and need is important.) Respecting the boundaries of the other partner Altering the living environment to provide adequate pri- vacy and reduce embarrassment Scheduling of \"adult time\" if there are young children in the family Wearing street clothes rather than night attire whenever possible during the day to emphasize normality and reduce playing the sick role ALS.

Preservation of personal integrity should be an overriding concern. If you have any ques- tions or concerns, speak with your doctor and request a referral to a sexual health clinician in your area. For more information refer to the ALS pamphlet on Sexuality, Intimacy and Chronic Illness. It can be found on the ALS website www.als.ca/publications-and-resources/als-fact- sheets. Complementary and Alternative Healthcare (CAHC) and Natural Health Products (NHP) In the search for better health and well-being, the healthy as well as those managing an illness for which there is no cure or limited treatment often look to complementary and alternative health care (CAHC) and natural health products (NHPs) for answers. Complementary and alternative healthcare (CAH) refers to practices that complement mainstream medicine by contributing to a common whole, by sat- isfying a demand not met by conventional approach- es. Massage and meditation are CAH practices that have become quite common in chronic disease management. natural health products (nHPs) refer to herbs, vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, and homeopathies. There is very little scientific evidence to sup- port the safety and effectiveness of many CAHC and NHP claims and in some cases may be detrimen- tal to a person with a disease such as ALS, or anyone on any medication. However, there are certainly legitimate practices, such as mas- sage and supplement use (e.g., vita- min E) that may have a positive effect on feelings of well-being. The ALS Society is supportive of you and your doctor working together to find what works best for you. If you are seeing an alternative practitioner, let your medical doctor know as you need to take care that nothing interferes with the medicines you are taking to manage ALS symp- toms. No matter how desperate you are to find a cure for ALS,It is also recommended that you and your doctor read the fact Sheets -ALS/Mnd: The dangers of Unproven Therapies , written by Dr. Andrew Eisen and natural Health Products-Making Sense of Complementary and Alternative Medicines, both listed in the Resource section of the Manual. 2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 39ALS.

Cranio-Sacral: A cranio-sacral massage is a very light and gentle massage of the back of the head and neck. It is non-invasive and very soothing. Tens Machine: A Tens Machine stimulates muscles through electronic impulses, and is often used by physiotherapists. The cost of most massage treatments ranges between $40 and $75 for sessions up to an hour in length. Most of these treat- ments are not covered by provincial healthcare plans, but may be covered in whole or in part by private or group insurance if they are prescribed and/or delivered by a reg- istered therapist. Meditation Meditation is a way to relax and revitalize both mind and body, and can be practised in many ways. Technically, medi- tation is deliberately entering into an inner silence and still- ness for a certain period of time, usually 15-20 minutes. It has been practised over the centuries by many different cul- tures and in many different ways. Referring to the results of researching meditation in his book The Relaxation Response, (Avon Books, N.Y.), Dr. Herbert Benson writes that meditation creates an overall awareness of relaxation and a feeling of well-being. Breathing and heart rate slow down, blood pressure drops, and there is an increase of healing alpha waves from the brain. In other words, medi- tation can reduce stress, and relax muscles. Meditation techniques can be divided into two categories. One type of meditation involves concentrating on some- thing, such as your breathing, a candle flame, a religious object, or even rolling surf, while peacefully and silently repeating a mantra, a special word or sound. Any wordthat contributes to inner peacefulness can work. The other type of meditation also involves repeating a mantra, but the objective is to relax your mind entirely. When thoughts come into your mind, you try to relax, observe the thoughts and let them flow, without participating in the thought process. For most people, this takes practice.be very wary of unconventional treatments that make claims of being able to \"cure\" or \"reverse ALS.\" Usually the people offering these \"cures\" charge thousands and thousands of dollars leaving families left with no money to pay for essentials or for needed traditional symptom management treatments. Unfortunately, many of the peo- ple pushing these claims are making a lucrative living at the expense of people who are looking for hope. The following information provided takes a look at mas- sage, meditation, and NHPs in general terms. Massage and Touch Therapies Touch therapies can be very relaxing and comforting for people with ALS. They can warm up limbs, which often feel cold because of inactivity, low circulation and decreased muscle mass. Though touch therapies are usual- ly given by a caregiver or therapist, self-massage can also be very beneficial. It is important to talk to your doctor before receiving massage therapy. The easiest touch therapy to learn is massage. For the most beneficial massage, body oil is used to lubricate the skin, which aids in soothing and relaxing the muscles. Massage involves systematically stroking, kneading and pressing the soft tissues of the body with fingers and the palm of the hand, working on the muscles, ligaments and tendons. A complete massage covers the entire body, inducing a state of warmth and relaxation. However a massage of parts of the body, such as arms, legs or shoul- ders is also beneficial and will help improve circulation. Shiatsu: Shiatsu is a Japanese system of touch therapy and is given using fingers, thumbs and hands. The forearm, knees, and feet can also be used, applying pressure to specific points on the body. Reflexology: Reflexology is based on the theory that pressing and mas- saging certain points in the feet will affect the whole body and induce relaxation. Caution: While having ALS is not a contraindication to massage therapy, modifications in technique may be required and should be done so under medical consul- tation. 2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 40alternative medicines. Scientifically, little is known about the effect of alternative medicines on the human body. new Regulations in Canada: As of January 2004, new nHP Regulations under Health Canada, designed to balance the need forsafety and efficacy with consumer choice. The new regulations stipulate that every NHP sold in Canada mustbe issued a product licence, which registers it with HealthCanada. The new regulatory framework incorporates anevidence-based approach that assesses products for safetyand effectiveness. The Standards of Evidence developed are clearly defined criteria concerning the amount of evidence required to support each claim (five levels ranging from\"well-designed systematic reviews and meta-analysis ofrandomized controlled trials (RCT) or at least one well-designed RCT\" to \"references to traditional use\"). Thestronger the claim, the stronger the supporting evidenceneeds to be. As a consumer, you will now be able to tellwhat level of evidence is available which will help informyour choice. Talk to your doctor about the claims a prod-uct is making in terms of what it says it can do for you. Your doctor can help you decide if it could be harmful or could negate the effect of other med- ications you are taking. Also con- sider the cost of the product. If it is very expensive, butthere is little if any scientific evidence to support theclaims, you may want to reconsider. If you find something that helps you feel better or makes your life a little bit easier, let your doctor know about your progress. He or she may want to study it further, or share it with other appropriate patients. Before starting to meditate it is usually best to let otherpeople in your house know that you don't want to be dis-turbed for 20 minutes. Many meditation teachers suggestthat, for the best results, meditation should be done twicea day, for about twenty minutes, with your eyes closed.When you think about 20 minutes is up, gently open youreyes and look at your watch. Two common problems forthose new to meditation are being unable to relax as theirminds are so full of thoughts and/or when they are finallyrelaxed, they fall asleep. It takes daily practice and time to develop the ability to achieve a state of conscious relaxation. Sometimes quiet,peaceful music can help the mind calm down, but in laterphases of meditation that may be too distracting. There are several other techniques to help clear the mind, and achieve a state of relaxation, including music therapyand visualization therapy. Books on this subject can pro-vide patients with knowledge of these techniques, instruc-tions, exercises and many hours of quiet pleasure. Yournurse, social worker, occupational therapist, or other men-tal health professional may also be good resources for information and training. natural Health Products (nHPs) Because vitamins, herbs and other so-called complementary or alternative medi-cines (natural health products) have become so popularover the last few years, it is appropriate to say a few thingsabout these potential remedies in the context of research.People with ALS can be particularly attracted to theseremedies either because drug trials so far have been unsuc-cessful, or because of the perception that alternative medi-cines are natural. While extensive and rigorously controlled research is done for pharmaceutical drugs before they can go tomarket, much, much less research is done on nHPswith the exception of vitamins, which have beenextensively researched. On the other hand many NHPs have been used by some cultures for hundreds and even thousands of years. Stories circulate about people whohave been cured by these medicines. Also, it is well known that animal and plant by-products have provided the basisfor many successful drugs. Unfortunately, the hundreds ofmillions of dollars required to thoroughly test pharmaceutical medicines are not available to test For more information on natural health products, see the fact Sheet--natural Health Products.

FOREVER.0030ADAPTING TO CHANGES IN MOBILITY AND MAINTAINING INDEPENDENCE SUB-SECTIONA Manual for People Living with ALSEveryday activities, such as getting out of bed, sitting down to dinner, carrying in bags, areoften taken for granted. As ALS progresses, and motor neurons die, these simple actions canbecome more difficult and require more effort.Working with an occupational therapist and a physio-therapist familiar with ALS will help you come up withways to stay as functionally mobile as you can to con-tinue to accomplish the everyday activities you areaccustomed to doing. Mobility strategies include exercise and mobility aids. These strategies aim to promote physical comfort, pre-vent injury, and help maintain independent living.Caregivers will also benefit from education around safehandling and transfer techniques. As motor neurons die, muscles become weaker and stiffer. As a result, someone with ALS will becomeless mobile in terms of moving their head and limbs.When it is difficult to move body parts, the associatedjoints become stiff which can be quite painful.Therapeutic exercise can help relieve discomfort.Recreational exercise can also help with physical symp-toms as well as boost one's enjoyment of living. It is important to realize that exercise will not strength- en muscles that have been weakened by ALS. Once thesupply of motor neurons that control a particular mus-cle has degenerated, it cannot be regenerated by exer-cise or anything else. It was previously believed that exercise was harmful forpeople with ALS due todamage from overuse. Wenow know that exercise can be very helpful. Exercise programs should berecommended by an occupational therapist or physical therapist to ensure the right kind of exercises and howmuch is right for you. Exercise should not cause painand excessive fatigue or shortness of breath. Four types of exercise may be considered for people with ALS. 1. flexibility training - stretching and range ofmotion exercises (ROM) prevents contractures and frozen shoulder decreases spasticity stimulates circulation improves joint lubrication 2. Strengthening - moderate resistance exercises, for example, Thera-Band may decrease disuse atrophy may maintain mobility and function longer 3. Aerobic - exercises for example stationary cycling and walking) may slow deterioration reduces spasticity 4. Balance training may reduce falls (Dal Bello-Haas et al., 2007; Drory et al., 2002; Krivickas, 2003) The purpose of exercise for people with ALS is: To maintain or improve the strength and flexibility of muscles not affected by ALS To maintain the flexibility of muscles that have beenaffected To maintain the flexibility of joints in the neck, trunkand limbs To help manage pain and stiffness due to spasticityand increase tone Range-of-Motion (ROM) Exercises A person with ALS needs to move each affected joint through a series of range- of-motion (ROM) exercises every day to prevent joint stiffening. Exercise will help to keep your body as flexible as pos- sible and your joints mobile. ROM exercises are usuallydone systematically, meaning that the joints of onelimb are exercised in a particular order before the nextlimb is exercised and so on. The objective of ROM exercises is to move each affected joint through its full range of motion everyday. This can be accomplish in different ways.ExERCISE AND ALS Mobility strategies... aim to promote physical comfort, prevent injury, and help maintain independent living. 2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 43ALS.

Mobility aids are used to: Prevent falls and related injuries Promote independent mobility and contracture prevention when there is spacticity.An active exercise is one you do yourself without any assistance, when your muscles can perform the full movement. When you cannot move through a ROMexercise on your own, you can still complete the move-ment as an active-assisted exercise. A helper may assist the muscle through the movement, or you maybe shown a way to do a self-assisted range of motionexercise. Passive exercises are done completely by a helper when muscles can no longer perform any of themovement. The helper moves the joints through theirROM by manipulating your limb. Passive exerciseswork the joints but not the muscles. Your therapist cantrain your caregiver(s) to do these exercises properly. The transition from active to passive exercise is seldom abrupt. You may find that you can do some exercisesactively, some with assistance and still others only passively.Each person with ALS needs an exercise program tai-lored to their own individual needs and abilities. Aphysiotherapist can prescribe an exercise program thatis right for you. They will demonstrate the exercises toensure that they will be performed correctly. Ask fordiagrams of the exercises to help you and your caregiv-er remember the techniques. It is important that all exercise be performed in moder- ation. Use your fatigue levels to help guide you.Conserve your energy for activities you enjoy. Keep inmind that day-to-day activities, such as cleaning andcooking, count as exercise! If you find that your pre-scribed set of exercises tires you, talk to your therapist.Changes can be made that will eliminate the risk offatigue. Similarly, none of your exercises should cause pain. If you do experience pain when exercising, stop that exer-cise and talk to your therapist. It may be that you arenot doing the exercise correctly, or perhaps some mod-ification to your exercise program must be made. Recreational Exercise If you enjoy such activities as walking, stationary bicy- cling, and especially swimming, keep them up for as long as you can do them safely. If you experiencecramping or fatigue, do not continue the exercise until you have consulted your doctor or therapist. Yourphysiotherapist and occupational therapists will help you make adaptations to both the activity and the Some Exercising Tips... Consult with a physiotherapist to design a pro- gram.

Your physiotherapist can helpyou to make decisions about the type of exercisethat is most suitable for you. Prioritize your exercises based on how effective they are for you in terms of injury and pain pre- vention and maximizing the functions most impor-tant to you. Ask your therapist which exercises arethe most important ones to do if you have a busyday ahead of you to conserve energy. find out which exercise position is best for you. Some exercises can be done while you either sit orlie down. Passive exercises are usually performedwhile you lie down. Your therapist can advise youon best positions. Exercises should not cause or increase pain. Consult your therapist if this happens. MOBILITY AIDS2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 44ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSADAPTING TO CHANGES IN MOBILITY AND MAINTAINING INDEPENDENCE SUB-SECTION 0032Injury Prevention As limbs become weakened, stiff, or easily fatigued mobility aids should be discussed with your doctor, physiotherapist, or occupational therapist. Appropriate use of mobility assistive devices will reduce your risk for falls. However, sometimes falls are the trigger for someone to ask about mobility aids. In the event that you find yourself falling, it is better to drop straight down, and not fall forward or backward to avoid a head injury. The best way to get up from a fall depends on what muscles you can still use. If you stillhave enough arm and hand strength, you can hold on to something firm, such as furniture, for example and pull yourself up and into achair. When you have fallen, the most important thing to do is to get help to sit in an upright posi- tion. The level of assistance needed will depend on the level of muscle weakness. Youmay only need a little support while rising, or you may need two people to assist you into a chair or wheelchair. If you have shoulder weakness, be careful that thoseassisting you do not pull on your arms, potentially caus-ing injury to weakened joints. It is also important that caregivers not strain themselves, but make you comfort-able until additional help is available. Ask your therapist to teach you and your caregivers the best method of recovering from falls. Joint pain and stiffness injuries occur when you are unable to move yourself and you spend too long in one position. This can be very uncomfortable for both the skin and the joints. Arrange for your caregivers to change your position every couple of hours throughout the day and to turn you at night. Some people with ALS improve their comfort in bed by using a sheepskin, egg crate or tempra foam, gel mattress pad or an alternating pressure air mattress. Your nurse or therapist can discuss the options with you and help you to decide what to try. If you experience joint pain, discuss this with a doctor or physiotherapist.Injuries to both persons with ALS and caregiverscan occur during transfers. All your caregivers should be instructed in safe and effective transferring techniques by professional healthcare providers as soon as possible. It is important that proper body mechanics be taught to decrease the risk of injury to both you and your caregiver. In addition to body mechanics, there are transfer devices such as sliding boards and mechanical lifts that can be used to pre- vent injury. Assistive Devices Assistive devices range from walking aids to transfer devices to home adap- tations such as ramps.Additional information on assistive devices is included in the manual under the Assistive Equipment section. Canes and Walkers Most ALS patients will require a cane or walker sooner or later. Walking poles have also started to become a popular choice. Gait aid prescription should be made in consultation with your doctor, occupational therapist, or physiotherapist. Mobility equipment will provide the stability you need and also help your walking be more efficient and less fatiguing. Walkers provide more stability than canes. There are several types of canes: single point (straight cane with a handle); four-point (a cane with a four pronged bottom); and forearm crutches (a crutch not positioned under the arm, but has a sec- tion that grips onto the forearm and has a hand grip). Walkers come in many forms. Talk to your therapist about the right walker for you. Orthoses Orthoses are devices that are attached to your body to support weak joints as well as aid in positioning Treat your equipment as helpful friends, not objects of immobility. I have named my walker \"Mickey\" and for my wheelchair I am thinking of \"Boudicca\" for the chariot that carried Queen Boudicca into battle when she almost chased the Romans out of Britain in 62 Ad. Bobbi Harris, 84 Person with ALS\" \"2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 45ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.0033ADAPTING TO CHANGES IN MOBILITY AND MAINTAINING INDEPENDENCE SUB-SECTIONA Manual for People Living with ALSOrthoses help to maintain function and comfort. The most commonly recommended for people withALS are ankle-foot orthoses (AFO), cervical (neck)collar; low-back brace; wrist splints, and resting handsplint. With respect to moving around on foot, AFOs are customarily recommended if you experience \"footdrop.\" Weakened ankle muscles cause difficulty pick-ing up the foot to walk properly without tripping.Your body alone may compensate by utilizing the hipmuscle to lift the foot high enough to avoid tripping.However, this can cause fatigue in the leg musclescompensating. Use of an AFO can reduce the workof the hip and knee musculature thus enchancingendurance and reducing tripping and risk for falls. Your doctor usually prescribes such devices, and your therapist will fit and instruct you in proper use of theaid. Wheelchairs Many people with ALS will find themselves in needof a wheelchair at some point in time. Some will useit only for long excursions outside the home, somefor activities only, and some people will spend mostof their day in a wheelchair. When and how oftenyou need to use a chair and the type of chair youneed will change overtime. The decision about when to acquire a wheelchair is one that you will make with your doctor and/oroccupational therapist. Questions you need to answer include: Do you always need another person to help you to rise from a seated position? Do you stumble and fall a lot? Are you fatigued when you walk? Do you avoid outings because you are afraid ofinjuring yourself, or becoming too fatigued? No one is eager to use a wheelchair and this is natu- ral, but a wheelchair should be viewed as an opportu-nity to increase your independence and your ability toget around. It will also help you to conserve yourenergy. A therapist can help you decide on andobtain the most appropriate chair. Selecting a chair will depend on your own personalneeds. This which will require an assessment muchinput from an OT, PT, or rehabilitation specialist to assess your needs and determine required customizationfor fit and accessories. Because ALS is progressive, youmay need different types of wheelchairs for varyingperiods of time. Try to borrow some of the types ofchairs you may not need on an ongoing basis to saveyour resources for more expensive equipment later on ifthis is going to be required. Wheelchairs range in type with the major two cate- gories being manual and power. Manual chairs are much less expensive and are most appropriate for some-one who still has some ability to move themselves.Power chairs are most appropriate for someone whocannot, or for individuals with significant fatigue.Before purchasing a power chair you need to make sureyour home is wheelchair accessible. Additionally, youmay want to consider transportation of the wheelchairas most power chairs cannot fit in a regular vehicle.Most manual chairs can be folded into the trunk or backseat, making them a more portable option for most indi-viduals. A typical manual wheelchair for someone with ALS may include the following features: high reclining back with headrest; elevating leg rests; cushion; adjustable height arm rests removable fortransfers; quick-release rear wheels for easy breakdownand storage in a vehicle; correct seat height for transfers;and appropriate overall seat width in order to gothrough doors at home. A power wheelchair for someone with ALS usually includes: special drive control electronics which can be expanded as your needs change (e.g., if hands becometoo weak, hand controls can be changed to chin, head orfoot, or single switch scanning; switches for operatingseat tilt, recline, or elevation; adjustable back with headsupport, seat cushion; and power or manually operatedelevated leg rests. Not only can a wheelchair assist with your mobility, many everyday activities can be accomplished while seat-ed in a wheelchair.

Keeping your body close to the other person, assist them to step or pivot their feet towards the sur-face to which they are transferring. Low Pivot transfer: This type of transfer is most useful for someone who can take some weight through the legs but not enough to fully stand orwalk. When transferring to and from a wheelchairensure that the brakes are locked and that the armresthas been removed. Place one arm around the person'sback, just below the shoulder blades and the otherarm under their thighs. Have the person lean forwardand (if able) reach towards the surface to which theyare transferring. Counting aloud throughout thetransfer helps coordinate and minimizes the effortinvolved for both parties. Lying-to-sitting: Roll to your side facing the edge of the bed you want to sit up on. If you cannot roll yourself, your caregiver can be taught how to assistyou. Once you are on your side, bend your knees sothat your legs hang over the edge of the bed andpush yourself up into sitting through using the handof your uppermost arm and the forearm of the other arm. A caregiver canoffer stability as needed.To lie down from a sit-ting position the tech-nique is reversed. Again,it is very important that caregivers do not grab and/or pull on your arms. Repositioning in bed: When preparing to get into bed, always try to position yourself in such a way thatwhen you lie down your head will be at the upper-most part of the bed. A Physiotherapist can provideteaching around bed mobility as needed. Bridging androlling techniques can be useful for repositioning pur-poses. If you are unable to reposition yourself inde-pendently in bed a turning sheet can be a helpful toolfor caregivers. 2. Transfers with EquipmentTransfer board: A smooth board acts as a bridge between two surfaces and is very helpful when throughout the day, conserves energy and reduces the risk of injury. For example, trays can be affixed formeals or holding a laptop computer. Electronic switchesused to operate the computer or any other environmentalcontrols in your home can also be attached. Whichever type of wheelchair you use, it is critical to have it customized to best fit you and your mobili-ty needs. Transfers Assisted transfers are a leading cause of caregiver injury when proper body mechanics are not used. Poor transfertechniques also increase potential harm for the personbeing moved. The following transfer strategies can help,but it is important to always learn and practice transferswith a therapist before trying it on your own. 1. Transfers Without EquipmentSit-to-stand transfer: When rising from a seated to standing position (whether alone or with help), proper positioning is imperative. Feet should be positioned flaton the floor, hip widthapart, heels in line withedge of the seat. Scootto the edge of the chair,lean your trunk forward30-40 degrees and rise.Arm rests on the chair are a helpful addi-tional support. There are a variety ofhandling techniques that can be shown to youand your caregiver if you require assist to stand. Somecaregivers prefer the aid of a transfer belt. Your PhysicalTherapist can assist you and your caregiver in determin-ing and teaching the most appropriate handling tech-niques. It is very important helpers do not grab and/orpull on your arms, especially if shoulders are weak, asthis could damaged weakened joints. It is also importantnot to pull on the helper's back. Standing pivot: This transfer is best suited to someone who is able to stand and take weight through the legs but may need some assistance achieving an maintaining a standing position.Using either a transfer belt around the person's hips orplacing your hands on their lower pelvis, bring the per- son's trunk forward and assist them into a standing posi- I wouldn't want to be without satin or sateen sheets-they allow for easier movement and shifting position, enabling a longer period of independence.\" \" Terry Schultz ALS family caregiver2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 47ALS.

With one end of the board under your buttocks, and the otherplaced onto the surface to which you are transferring,a sliding transfer can be performed with or withoutcaregiver assistance. This technique is best usedbetween surfaces of similar heights. Rotating transfer board: This is a board that has a lazy Susan feature on it that will rotate you once you are positioned on it. This takes practice, but can bevery effective. A common brand of rotating transferboard is the Beasy\u00ae Board. Lifts Lifts are valuable assistive devices especiallywhen you are no longer able to stand. Additional information on lifts is included in the Manual underthe \"Assistive Equipment\" section. facilities If you have problems walking, or are in a wheelchair, telephone your destination ahead of time to find out what accessible facilities are available where you willbe staying, as well as at any of the attractions you mayvisit. Some places are very accessible to the disabled,others are not. Be very specific about what yourneeds are - \"accessible\" means different thingsto different people. So, you may need to ask if there are ramps, elevators, wheelchair accessible rooms in the hotel, etc. Air Travel Most airports provide wheelchairs that you can take toand from the plane. Make sure that the airline knows inadvance that you require a wheelchair. If you need to beaccompanied by an attendant, and have the appropriatedocument signed by a doctor, some airlines let anaccompanying attendant fly at a discounted rate. Airlinesalso provide other services for the disabled includingspecial meals. When inquiring about reservations, it isalso a good idea to make sure that the airline canaccommodate your disability requirements. In particu- lar if you need to you use a non-invasive ventilatorwhile traveling, be sure to contact the airline beforebooking a trip to find out if they permit the deviceyou use to be used in-flight. You may need to contact the device manufacturer to see if they have a sticker youcan affix to the device indicating it meets aircraft safetyrequirements. Auto Travel Some families with ALS purchase a wheelchair accessi-ble (barrier-free) van, for every day use as well as roadtrip vacations. Keep in mind you must be assessed andtrained in the use of hand controls by a driver rehabilia-tion specialist, before you are legally able to drive a handcontrolled vehicle. There are companies that also rent barrier-free converted vans for extended road trips, or to use upon arrival at your destination. In theUnited States (e.g., Wheelchair Getaways, (800) 642-2042, www.wheelchairgetaways.com ). For auto travel in Ontario, barrier-free van rentals are available in Torontothrough Kino Mobility at (888) 495-4455. Check withyour local Canadian Automobile Association (CAA) ordestination Visitors Bureau to find out about other resources that may be available in your destination city. Public Transit Many larger cities offer accessible public transit for peo- ple with mobility impairments. Accessible public transittypically consists of specially equipped buses or taxislicensed by the municipality to carry disabled passengers.Note that buses and taxis may require booking appoint-ments for pick-up. Larger cities may also have subwaysaccessible by elevator. Check with your provincial socie-ty for public transit options in your area.Talk to Your Therapist Your therapist can also provide informa- tion on other transfer devices such as the standing transfer pivot. Ask about the lat- est in available equipment and work with your therapist to determine what will best meet your needs. Remember, before attempting any transfers make sure your therapist has explained them and trained you and your caregivers.

Similarly, if you are going to be traveling in the United States, contact the nearest ALS Association (ALSA) Chapter. For an ALSA Chapter list, go to www.alsa.org . If you are traveling abroad, check the ALS/MND International Alliance web site for information on associations available by country (www.alsmndalliance.org ). A Final Note on Mobility... Mobility function and need for adaptive aids will change overtime with ALS. It is important to remain in contact with occupational and physiotherapists who understand ALS as they can help you plan for changes and adapta-tions ahead of time. Advance planning will help make transitions smoother as well as promote comfort, safety, and independence. Please access the ALS Society nearest you to inquire about an equipment program designed to get you the de- vices you need in as timely a manner as possible. To- gether, you, your healthcare team and the society can work to help you adapt to mobility changes and maintain independence for as long as possible.

As food, drinks and saliva get stuck in the throat and sucked into the lungs, it can cause a lung infection (pneumonia) The Four Phases of Swallowing In phase-one , the food is chewed or \"processed\" in the mouth to form a mass (bolus) . In phase-two , the muscles of the cheek, tongue, and upper throat move it into the back of the mouth where the food triggers a reflex-like response causing the soft palate to rise to prevent food from entering the nasal cavity (nose). If these muscles are weakened, food may be difficult to move back in the mouth, or enter the throat prematurely. It can also lead to residue in the mouth (material left in the mouth after the swallow is completed). In phase-three the larynx (voice box) is raised , and the tongue moves back and the airway entry is closed to prevent food from entering the trachea (windpipe or breathing tube). In phase-four the muscles at the top of the esopha- gus contract (people with ALS may find that the lower muscles don't relax, in which case food gets stuck, feeling as if it is stuck in the back of the throat). A final muscle contraction moves the food into the esophagus toward the stomach. Swallowing Assessments Swallowing assessments typically involve a chair side assessment which involves inspection of your mouth, and observations of how you eat and drink small samples of food and liquid. Sometimes you will be asked to eat or drink different textures ofSome people with ALS may lose function in their mouth and throat which makes eating and drinking a challenge. Due to fear of choking, or frustration and fatigue with the time it takes to eat a meal, some individuals may eat less, resulting in not getting enough nutrition (calories and nutrients), weight loss, worsened fatigue, and weakness. Fatigue plays a very big role in why a person's nutri- tional status declines. Weight loss occurs because with ALS, increased energy is required for all activi- ties including eating and your body's basic energy requirements are higher (increased basal metabolic rate). Therefore, addressing issues with the mechanics of eating and drinking (controlling food and swallow- ing) and alternative dietary solutions is critical in the management of ALS. The speech-language pathol- ogist and dietitian on your healthcare team, along with your doctor, will be your major resources for adapting to swallowing problems and maintaining good nutrition. Swallowing is the act of moving food or drink from the mouth, through the throat (the pharynx) and down the esophagus to the stomach. If your swal- lowing muscles are affected, your symptoms will de- pend on which muscles are weak. For example, if you have tongue and lip weakness you may have trouble keeping liquids sealed in your mouth for swallowing or moving food around in your mouth effectively. If your jaw muscles are more affected, chewing may be tiresome or difficult. Weakness, slowness, and poor coordination in the muscles of the throat may cause material to stick in the throat or become misdirected into the voice box (i.e. the larynx). Aspiration is when food goes down the wrong way when we swallow. Our throat is tube with two openings on the bottom: one opening goes down to our stomach (the esophagus) and the open- ing goes to our lungs (the trachea). Aspiration typi- cally happens because we have to hold our breaths when we swallow. If things get stuck in our throat when we swallow, it often gets sucked down into theTHE MECHANICS OF SwALLOwING PGS 36 44 Als Manual .e$S_Layout 1 12-07-03 3:41 PM Page 3ALS.

Throughout all assessments, your therapist will be interested in your experience with swallowing and will be asking detailed questions about foods and drinks that cause you to cough or clear your throat. Swallowing assessments sometimes include an x-ray procedure called a Modified Barium Swallow Videofluoroscopic Swakkiwubg Study (VFSS) . This is ordered with the permission of your doctor and is an outpatient exam. This is done because the speech-language pathologist cannot see what is hap- pening inside your throat when you swallow. You will be asked to eat and drink small amounts of food and drink that will be coated in barium so they can be seen on x-ray. This exam is helpful in identi- fying swallowing problems, testing if different posi- tions or strategies help you swallow more safely and for determining what kinds of foods are safest for you to swallow. Because of the variety of muscles used to speak and swallow, the problems that occur as a result of de- generation depend on which muscles have been af- fected. If these problems occur it is important that you consult your doctor for a referral to a speech-language pathologist with ALS knowl- edge and expertise in assessing and managing swallowing problems. It is sometimes valuable for you and your caregiver to see a copy of your swal- lowing x-ray to give you a better understanding of what happens inside your throat when you swallow. Common Swallowing Difficulties Swallowing difficulties may include: Coughing during or after eating and drinking A wet or gurgled sounding voice during or after eating or drinking Throat clearing after a sip or bite Leaking of food from mouth Difficulty chewing Difficulty moving food around mouth Difficulty starting to swallow Food or drink escaping from nose area Sensation of food caught or stuck in the throatYou may also want to consult a therapist if you: Get tired during meals Take a long time to eat (longer than 30 minutes per meal) Lose weight No longer enjoy or are uninterested in eating Adapting How You Take Medication Many people with ALS have particular trouble with swallowing medications. If you are having this prob- lem you might consider: 1. Grinding pills into powder with a pill crusher (available from your pharmacy) and mixing them with pudding or another smooth, easy-to-eat food like apple sauce or yogurt (ask the pharmacist if it is appropriate to crush pills-it is not recommended for slow release medications) 2. Asking your pharmacist if your pill medication is available in liquid form, or if he or she could custom make a liquid suspension for you. How to Make Eating and Drinking Safer While eating can be one of the joys in life, it can be a chal- lenging activity for people with ALS with weakened bulbar muscles. There is a well documented connection be- tween safe swallowing and maintaining good respira- tory (breathing) health. People with swallowing problems are at higher risk of developing a pneumonia called aspiration pneumonia than the average population. Learn as much as you can about your own swallowing limi- tations and make sure your diet is adapted to your changing abilities. Here are some tips for making eating easier and safer. Take more time Eating and drinking may be a very slow and labour inten- sive process. Allow more time to eat meals and avoid rush- ing. Smaller and more frequent meals may be easier than three large meals and lead to less fatigue.

Emergency Preparedness Learn what to do before an emergency happens. When the throat gets irritated or blocked, it can close around the irritant making it difficult to breathe. Even your saliva can cause coughing and choking. This may also happen when a few small particles from a previous meal are still stuck in the throat. It is best that you and your caregivers take a recog- nized First Aid course with special attention given to identifying signs of obstruction (blockage) and learning appropriate responses. Knowing the Heimlich maneuver is a must for your caregivers. Ask a member of your ALS care team about this or contact your regional ALS Unit, local Red Cross Society or St. John's Ambulance branch for CPR and First Aid courses in your area. The emergency response suggestions below may or may not be appropriate for every individual cir- cumstance. Reading these is by no means a sub- stitute for First Aid certification. They are included here just to give you some familiarity with what may be helpful. Try swallowing two or three times to clear it. It may be that the upper esophageal sphincter muscles at the bottom of your throat, which are normally closed, are not relaxing and opening as actively as they should to allow swallowing. Try to relax. Lean forward, the further the better, de- pending on the seriousness of the problem. If possi- ble, stand up and bend over as if to touch your toes Try to take small breaths through the nose. Expel the food by breathing in slowly, and exhaling or coughing quickly. For more force \"splint\" you're ab- domen by crossing your arms over your lower ab- domen and pressing firmly in and down as you cough out. A caregiver can also do this by standing behind you and pressing their hands into your abdomen as you cough. Ask a nurse or other professional to show you this technique, known as the Heimlich maneuver, and practice it with your caregivers as soon as possibleaccompany embarrassment, and anxiety itself impairs the ability to relax. Being relaxed and feeling confident is of tremendous assistance. Concentrate on eating Make sure there are no distractions like TV or radio while eating. If eating in a group is also distracting, consider qui- eter meal times for yourself and one other person who can help you when needed. You can then simply use the group meal time to socialize and not worry about eating at that time. Do not try to combine eating with talking. Focus on eating position With swallowing problems you should eat in an up- right position. Sometimes your SLP will suggest you tuck your chin towards your chest to further protect your airway during feeding. There is also adapted feeding equip- ment which your occupational therapist (OT) may recom- mend for easier eating. Take small bites and sips Small bites will require less trouble chewing and managing food in your mouth. Also, if you have problems with liq- uids, use straws with caution as liquid can be brought up into the mouth at a higher speed and volume than may be safely swallowed. Take food and liquid separately It may be difficult for the swallowing muscles to switch between eating and drinking, which require slightly different muscle activity. If you have foods like soups that have broth and solids, it may help to take in one consistency at a time, i.e., take a sip of broth and then a spoonful of solids. Sometimes saliva or mucus stuck in the throat, strong smells, smoke, alcohol, cold bursts of air, spicy foods or poorly control acid reflux (frequent indigestion) can cause the voice box to have a muscle spasm (laryngospam) which may temporarily block of the airway. Avoiding things known to trigger laryngospasms may be help. The use of medications to reduce muscle spasticity or tension and medications to prevent acid reflux or indigestion may elimi- nate or reduces the severity of the laryngospasm. Other techniques you can try if you experience a laryngospasmPGS 36 44 Als Manual .e$S_Layout 1 12-07-03 3:41 PM Page 5ALS. Three letters that change people's lives.

Things not to do in an emergency: Never use liquid to wash down food If food is stuck in the throat and liquid is added, the liquid can very easily be channeled into the airway lead- ing to your chest, and cause choking. Never hit a choking person on the back When a person is choking from food, hitting on the back can cause the food to jam tighter in the throat. Dietary Changes that Can Help If chewing and swallowing problems develop and progress, it may be necessary to make dietary tex- ture changes to cope with these reduced eating abilities. Consult with your dietitian, speech-lan- guage therapist, or doctor regarding changes to your diet. With changes in your oral (mouth) skills (, it may not only be difficult to chew, but also difficult to control food in your mouth. You may find it hard to keep your lips sealed tightly during eating or drinking. Or some foods and liquids may \"get away from you\" before you are ready to swallow them. When eating or drinking consider the following: Choose smaller and softer foods Food should be softer and cut into smaller pieces that require less chewing. (e.g., pasta and casseroles). Avoid very thin, runny foods If food or drinks are too thin or runny, they may be harder to control in the mouth and escape into the airway before you are prepared to swallow them. Some of the liquid can run into the airway to the lungs and cause coughing.(e.g. water, milk, juice). Water served at room temperature is often harder to swallow that ice cold water. For some people, car- bonated water is swallowed more safely than non- carbonated water. Avoid very dry foods (i.e. dried meat, pop- corn, nuts, hard candies may pose a choking hazard.Crumbly, dry or flaky foods like day old muffins, toast, crackers, chips, pastries, dry fish, and dry mashed potatoes may be more difficult to manage due to their tendency to have loose and errant crumbs. Moistening solids with gravies, sauces, but- ter, and broths can make dry foods more manage- able. Avoid mixed consistencies (e.g. watery soups mixed with semi-solid meat and or vegetables or cold cereals with a firm texture mixed with milk). Some people find that foods that have thin liquids mixed in with solids, like cereal and milk, or soup broth with meat or vegetables problematic because they have to manage two different food textures at the same time. Try taking either the liquid or solid separately. The same could be said for skinned solids, like peas, corn or oranges, which have both a skin and soft or juicy centre. A dietitian can make helpful suggestions about the following: Suitable methods of cooking Substitutions for suitable foods Ways to thicken thin liquids (for example, use commercial or natural thickeners Semi-solid foods (e.g., pudding, custard, cottage cheese, pur\u00e9ed fruit) Oral nutritional supplements (e.g., Ensure+ or Boost+) See the \"Resources\" section for cookbooks with easy swallowing recipes.

You and your dietitian should discuss which scenario fits you best and together develop a plan to meet your nu- tritional needs and goals.not the time to worry about fat and cholesterol! In addi- tion to special food supplements available in stores, there are many natural ways to supplement your food and drink for increased nutritional value. Please consult with your registered dietitian for appropriate ways tomaximize your nutrition. Drinking enough non-caf- feinated liquids is extremely important for overall health as well as for energy. Constipation may be a problem - the best solution is to get enough fluids over the day. Refer to the ALS Fact Sheet \"Constipation\" at www.als.ca/publications-and-resources/als-fact-sheets. Many persons with ALS reach a point when it is difficultto meet nutrition needs by eating alone.If you haven'talready done so, now is the time to discuss with your doctor the option of having a feeding tube put in place to make sure you maintain good nutrition. Tube Feeding What's it all about? Getting a feeding tube allows you to take in food and drink for energy and nutrition without having to do so by mouth. When swallowing and chewing are very difficult, you will not be able to get enough nutrition and hydra- tion by mouth alone. SwALLOwING PROBLEMS: FOODS TO LOSE...

How long a patient stays is de- pendent on his or her health. In some regions, the procedure may be performed as out-patient surgery followed by immediate home care support. Tube feedings are typically started about 24 hours after the procedure and often the external bumper will need to be loosened before the first feeding. Care providers will prescribe the quantity and type of nutritional supplements you should receive through tube feedings. During this period, learn how your new tube-feeding system works and how tomanage your tube feeds. Even if you won't be using tube feeding right away, you will still need to prac- tice flushing the tube twice per day to keep it clean.It is also important for your family or caregivers to receive the same training. The feeding pump Tube feeding can be accomplished through what is called \"gravity feeding\" by hanging the feed bag from an IV pole without a pump, or by using a sy- ringe. However, using a feeding pump for assistancemay be more comfortable and less likely to result in gastrointestinal problems (fullness, gas, regurgita- tion, vomiting, and diarrhea). Portable pumps are available for greater mobility. Talk to your dietitian about feeding pumps and other supplies. Excessive coughing may occur You may find that tube feeding causes excessive coughing. This may happen for a number of rea-sons, including excess saliva, reflux, or aspiration due to not sitting up enough, high feeding rate, orbecause of various other stomach problems. If this happens to you, consult your dietitian who may suggest reducing your feeding rate and/or de-crease the amount of formula given at the feeding. Avoid lying down during and after feeding You need to remain upright at 90 degrees during the feeding and for another 45 minutes after the feed is completed. Ask for home care tipsThe following information is designed to give you a better idea of what getting and living with a feeding tube is all about and to help you with your decision-making process. To watch a video about PEG tube insertion and feeding produced by Sun- nybrook Media, go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBzy3tHOps0 &feature=related The procedure If you make the decision to have a feeding tube, your doctor will refer you to a gastroenterologist or a gastrointestinal (GI) or general surgeon. To insert a stomach feeding tube, commonly re- ferred to as a percutaneous endoscopic gastros- tomy (PEG) tube, requires a simple 30-minute operation under mild sedation. A gastroenterolo- gist will perform the operation. The tube is placed directly into your stomach through the ab- dominal wall to provide another way for you to re- ceive nourishment and liquids, and medication Although the most common feeding tube for ALS patients is the PEG, your doctor may recommend getting a gastro-jejunostomy feeding tube (GJ- tube) instead. The procedure and breathing func- tion requirements differ. Talk to your doctor about your options. There are different types of feeding tube materi-als. Discuss which type is best for you with your doctor. PEG tubes can be either an actual tube made of soft pliable material which extends about six inches outside of your stomach, or in a button form which is smaller and lies flush against your abdomen. The feeding tube remains in place and is capped and uncapped at each feeding. Initially, a dressing is required around the incision. A small amount of leakage around the incision is not un- usual. When the incision heals, leaving it open to the air may be the best way to keep it healthy. Post-operative adjustment period After the operation, you may have to stay in the hospital so that healthcare professionals can assess your body's ability to adjust to an alternate way ofPGS 36 44 Als Manual .e$S_Layout 1 12-07-03 3:41 PM Page 8ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.0043ADAPTING TO SwALLOwING PROBLEMS AND MAINTAINING GOOD NUTRITION SUB-SECTIONA Manual for People Living with ALSAsk for home care tips After you have a feeding tube installed, and before leaving the hospital, arrange for appropriate home care assistance while you are getting used to tube feeding. You will probably have some questions re- garding tube feeding, cleaning procedures, supplies, suppliers, government assistance programs, etc. Also, hooking up the feeding bag requires a few tricks to prevent sending a tube full of air into your stomach before the food. Avoiding dehydration It is a serious mistake to as- sume that you are getting enough liquid because you are living on liquid nutrients. Con- centrated liquid nutrients do not contain much water. Take lots of water to avoid dehydra- tion. You will have to do water \"flushes\" as prescribed by your dietician before and after each time medications & PEG feed- ings are given. Your dietitian will include in your tube feed- ing schedule how much water you need. Choosing Tube- Feeding Equipment When you first have your feed-ing tube installed, you can learn in the hospital what your equipment needs will be. When you are at home you may first be using equipment supplied by your local ALS Society or home care provider for a few weeks, after which you will need to get your own equipment. You will need a method to hold up the container while feeding, such as an IV pole, a supply of feeding containers, some feeding syringes, and a supply of liquid food (for- mula). Please note that the cost for these supplies is not usually covered. In addition, you might have to hire and pay for private care to administer your feedsif you or your family members are unable to do so. It is important to inquire ahead of time what will be supported in your community and what you and your family will be responsible for. If you cannot be supported at home, the option of going to a Long Term Care (LTC) facility might need to be considered. Tube-feeding diet A dietitian at the hospital will usually work out your tube-feeding requirements based on what you can still eat normally and your estimated calorie re- quirements. Because your eating abilities will change, your tube-feed-ing requirements willprobably increase over time. When this occurs, increased feeding tube re- quirements should be re- calculated by a dietitian. Follow-up may also be provided by a home care or community dietitian. If you are not a patient at an ALS clinic, it is important that your doctor and dietitian be educated about ALS. Encourage them to contact your local ALS Society for referrals to specialists with whom they can consult. You should discuss the various commerciallyprepared alternatives with a dietitian. Depend-ing on where you live, products available may vary. However, some of the commonly recommended products are Boost\u00ae, Nutren 2.0\u00ae, and Compleat\u00ae. Your dietitian will prescribe what is best for you. Making your decision about a feeding tubeWhen your weight goes 10% to 15% below nor- mal, it is a good time to consider getting a feeding tube. You need to ask your doctor or your dieti- tian what a \"normal\" weight is for you. When eating or drinking leads to frequent chok- ing When it takes more than one hour to eat a meal When eating is no longer a pleasurable activity When respiratory function is decreasing and risk of aspiration pneumonia is increasing When your breathing function is considered too poor (see Adapting to Changes in Breathing and Maintaining Lung Function sub-section) When the idea of an incision or tube in the ab- domen is unacceptable When the cost of the formula is too high When the risks outweigh the benefitswHEN TO CONSIDER A TUBE... wHEN NOT TO CONSIDER A TUBE...PGS 36 44 Als Manual .e$S_Layout 1 12-07-03 3:41 PM Page 9ALS.

FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSADAPTING TO SwALLOwING PROBLEMS AND MAINTAINING GOOD NUTRITION SUB-SECTION 0044Making your decision about a feeding tube Making the decision to have a feeding tube is a major care decision when you have ALS. Some people choose to have a feeding tube, while others do not. Each decision should be made based on available, accurate information and personal prefer- ences. Whatever you decide, you should docu- ment your choice in your personal health care directive , share a copy of your directive with your doctor, and discuss your decision with your family members, in particular the individual whom you will appoint to be your proxy (legal representative of your wishes) in the event you cannot communi- cate your wishes to healthcare providers. Use the table on page 42 to review issues to consider when making a feeding tube decision. Speak with your ALS Social Worker about appropriate paperwork which will need to be filled out according to the legislation in your province. Use of feeding tube at end of life At end of life, either at home or in hospice, your palliative care team will likely discuss with you and your family the appropriateness and timing of ta- pering your intake of formula via the feeding tube. Towards end of life, the appetite and the body functions slow down and the need for nutrition de- creases, hence, the volume of formula you are tak- ing may be slowly decreased to ensure your comfort. A Final Note on Swallowing and Nutrition... If you have changes in swallowing, you may need to make gradual changes in how and what you eat and drink. Working closely with your doctor, die- titian, and speech language pathologist, will help you manage your nutritional challenges while maxi- mizing the enjoyment of tasting and eating for as long as you can. Eventually, you may need to make a major decision about whether or not you want to have a feeding tube. Use the information provided in this publica-tion as a discussion tool for you and your doctor and family members early so your decision is one that is thoughtful, timely, and right for you.

FOREVER. 00 45 ADAPTING TO CHANGES IN SPEECH AND MAINTAINING COMMUNICATION SUB-SECTION A Manual for People Living with ALS The following symptoms may be experienced: Weakness, stiffness, slow movements in your mouth, throat, and jaw muscles Muscle atrophy (wasting) or fasiculations (twitching) in your mouth and throat muscles Changes in voice quality (e.g. hoarseness, strained- strangled, lower pitch, nasality, breathiness, mono - tone, volume changes) Changes in your speech (e.g. nasal sounds, slower speech, slurred speech) Difficulty making your speech understood Increased difficulty with speech as the day goes on due to fatigue. Losing the ability to speak is a very significant change and one of the most difficult challenges associated with ALS. It can be frustrating for both the communicator and the listener. For some, it may be the end of off-the- cuff remarks and participating in quick conversation. For the listener it may become a question of trying to interpret. Some people are able to naturally adjust to these changes and use communication strategies, but it might be more challenging for others to do so. It is important to openly discuss how to adapt to changing speech with communication partners to maintain the best possible connection to family, friends, and caregivers. Caregivers need to make adjustments as well such as giving the person with ALS extra time to speak, encourage and accept different forms of com - munication, and problem solve together when commu - nication breaks down. It is important to remember that loss of speech is gradual and there is help. A range of strategies to enhance communication should be explored between you, your caregivers, and your SLP . While adapting speech patterns when speech is still the main way of communicating can help, using alternative communica - tion methods, as described more fully in the next sec - tion, will need to be considered if the ability to speak is substantially lost, or if it makes it easier to communi - cate in some situations even when you have some speech ability. Use of an oral prosthesis (palatal lift or other hard- palate prosthetic device) may be considered as a short- term option in cases where existing speech can be If you experience weakening muscles of the face, throat, neck and tongue, you may find difficulty with speaking, chewing, swallowing and control - ling mucous and saliva. If the onset of ALS is associ - ated with these types of symptoms, it is known as \"Bulbar ALS.\" People first diagnosed with limb onset ALS may develop bulbar symptoms later on. If speech problems occur, they progress gradually. Therefore, it is important to work with a speech language pathologist (SLP) with experience in ALS and augmentative and alternative communi - cation (AAC) early on, even before there are any speech impairments to assess speech, monitor it over time, and teach you strategies to help you use your nat - ural speech functionally for as long as possible, while at the same time gradually introducing other means of communication. Adaptations can and should be made to ensure you can always communicate what you want, when you want. Please note that exercises to strengthen your oral mus - cles are contraindicated in ALS. These exercises may exhaust already weakened muscles, providing no bene - fit. Speech therapy for people with ALS does not focus on strengthening oral muscles, as the exercises may be tiring and hasten deterioration. Please consult an SLP in an ALS clinic to further discuss this issue as needed. A speech language pathologist's assessment is helpful to determine which muscles are weak and how to best use the muscles still available for speaking. Speaking problems are generally caused by weaknesses in one or more of the following muscle groups: Breathing muscles - resulting in less air flow available to power your voice resulting in a strained, strangled sound; Vocal cords - resulting in breathiness, lowered pitch, and/or monotonous sounds; Soft palate and throat muscles - resulting in a nasal sound; Tongue and lip muscles - resulting in difficulty form - ing word sounds.

Typically a palatal lift reduces loss of air through the nose (nasal speech) and increases air pres- sure required for sound production. It cannot compen- sate for weak lips, breathing, or vocal cords. Sometimes a prosthesis can be added to the palatal liftto lower the hard palate of the mouth. This allows the weakened tongue to make contact with a hard surfaceto produce sounds such as \"t,d,k,g\". A prosthesis may improve swallowing and reduce prob-lems associated with nasal regurgitation (food or liquids coming up into your nose). However, it may not be a re- alistic option in cases where there is rapid change in communication function and control, or a strong gag re- flex. It is also a custome made device and may not be covered by your insurance. You should consult a speech language pathologist and/or prosthodontist (dentist who specializes in oral devices) to determine your best option. Use of a voice amplifier device can enhance the vol- ume of the voice. They may be an option if speech is understandable, but respiratory weakness is the cause of decreased speaking volume.Strategies to use later as speaking muscles continue to weaken may include the following: Use words that are easier to pronounce, if forming words is a problem Carry a pad of paper and pen to write out your mes- sages if you can still use your fingers Work out hand signals for frequently needs with your immediate family and other caregivers Use non-verbal signals (e.g., eye blinks for yes/no) Changing your patterns of speech can be difficult to do and may require practice sessions with an SLP to make those changes. AAC refers to a system used to either augment (en- hance) existing speech, or to serve as an alternative when there is no functional speech. AAC does NOT only mean using a \"computer talking device.\" AAC strategies refer to a range of methods used to facilitate sharing information, self-expression, signaling for atten- tion, maintaining contact with others, and problem solv- ing. Addressing AAC issues early will enable you to feel better prepared and comfortable when changes occur. Voice banking (recording your voice) can be con- sidered before any speech changes occur, or when speech changes are still mild. This could allow you to use your natural speech, in combination with synthe- sized speech on a communication device at a later time should you need to use an AAC device Which AAC strategies are best for you depends on your functional ability and on the situation. You may end up using several different ways to communicate over the course of a day. For instance you may use speech to communicate with your family members who are used to hearing you and can see you. E-mail may be preferred to speaking on the phone with others at a dis- tance. You may write messages or spell using a letter board or use a device that talks for you when communi- cating with people who are less familiar with your speech. Some people want to avoid electronic AAC devices and use only low-tech strategies and tools while others want AUGMENTATIVE AND ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION (AAC) STRATEGIES Think through what your needs are, and will be in the future. For example: Will you need a device mostly for communicating commonly used phrases? Are you able to write messages? Will you have to make presentations to groups of people? When choosing a device, some of the following factors may be relevant: Level of training needed and the complexity of the system Availability of support from family/friends Cost/coverage Portability Versatility Speed of communication Circumstances of use Amount of follow-up neededFACTORS IN MAkING AAC DECISIONSPGS 36 44 Als Manual .e$S_Layout 1 12-07-03 3:41 PM Page 12ALS.

Writing Boards Writing boards such as white boards and magic slates are often the preferred choice when you can still write. Markers and pens can be built up by an occupa- tional therapist as your grip weakens. Once grip is too weak to hold a marker, you may choose to use a com- munication board. Communication Boards Communication boards may include frequently used messages, topics, and/or letters. Words usually in- cluded on communication boards are lists of foods, comfort items, positioning requests, and social phrases. The more information there is, the larger the board must be. At the end of this sub-section, there is an ex- ample of a communication board that incorporates all three: letters, topics, and frequently used messages (Beuleman and Miranda, 1998). You simply point to the frequently used message, or letters to spell words. If you can no longer point to letters, then your eyegaze can be a reliable method of communicating. Communication boards that use gaze are transparent (see-through) and usually feature alphabet letters, sym- bols and/or complete words, phrases, or sentences. To use the board, look at the desired message or combina- tion of letters. When only face-to-face communication is needed and you can still indicate selections on a board by pointing or eye movements, a word or letter board is a good low-tech communication choice. In addition, your com- munication partner can assist you by scanning through the rows and columns of an alphabet board to allow you to spell out words and sentences. You can select the letters by using a Yes/No system according to your abilities (e.g. eye-blinks, looking down, eyebrows move- ments, etc.) An SLP can help develop and modify communication boards as needed. You may have several different boards for different communication scenarios. For ex- ample, one board may be dedicated for daily care rou- tines, while another is used for TV watching. the latest, most sophisticated high-tech equipment avail- able. Each device should be chosen with the unique needs of the individual in mind. You should also be aware of how long the chosen system will be useful to you. It is most likely that you will need to use several strategies as the disease progresses. People using invasive ventilation must contend with a tracheostomy tube inserted into their throat. But, they may be able to speak by using a speaking valve (e.g., Passy-Muir). A respiratory therapist and/or a speech- language pathologist can help train you on how to use this device. Before purchasing any AAC devices, get advice from an assistive technology clinic, from an SLP , or from another qualified source such as a rehabilita- tive engineer, or assistive technology professional. Expert professionals can help you select devices and train you how to use them. You can also visit local sup- pliers and try out the various options once an SLP or as- sistive device specialist has made some recommendations. Check to see what devices your local ALS Society has available for you to try. No-Tech Strategies Speech clarification and communication partner adjust- ment strategies require no technology. Strategies to use when speaking muscles start to weaken are: Conserve energy Take in a full breath before speaking Speak slowly with short sentences, and words with fewer syllables Say each syllable clearly (over exaggerate) and put pauses in between words Identify the topic first before you go into further de- tail Make your environment as communication friendly as possible: reduce background noise (e.g., turn TV off or on mute), make sure you and your listener can see each other If able, use gestures to what you are saying to add extra information for the listener Low-Tech Strategies Often simple manual systems are preferred because they permit continuing human contact without requir-PGS 36 44 Als Manual .e$S_Layout 1 12-07-03 3:41 PM Page 13ALS.

Signal- ing makes use of facial expressions, eye contact, eye movements, gestures, touch and body lan- guage. Some of this system's drawbacks include the limited nature of possible responses and the inability to communicate with people who are unfamiliar with thesystem. Personal signaling systems are a valuable backup to high-tech systems that are vulnerable to sys-tem failure. Other Signal Systems Low tech systems are available where you hit a switch or the device and it makes a sound (for example, a bell,intercom, or buzzer) for you to get attention when your communication partners are not in view. You and your family may want to apply for an emer- gency response service especially if there are times you will be in your home alone. Those who join aregiven a small (about the size of a small box of matches)transmitter with an emergency button on it. When joining an emergency response system you must tell the program people: Facts about their illness The names and phone numbers of people who should be contacted in case of emergency When the emergency button on the small transmitter is pressed, a signal is sent to the service that tells them who has the emergency. They will know the client's ill- ness and immediately call the names given to them foremergency purposes. Ask your healthcare provider or contact the ALS Society in your area for referrals to emergency-system vendors in your area. In addition, if you leave home without a caregiver, it may be wise to wear a Medic Alert (medical emergency) bracelet. Manual Communication Aids/Adapted Ac- cess Assistive devices to aid manual communication (i.e., writing, typing, or pointing to communication boards) include pencil grips, magic slates, and other portable boards, book holders, tilt-top tables,pointers, laser pointers, typing sticks (held in themouth, hand, or foot), writer's splints, TTY (tele- typer), TTD (telephone for the deaf), and pageturners. If you leave home without a caregiver, it may be wise to wear a Medic Alert (medical emergency) bracelet. Small Devices with Recorded Messages These devices are useful to use for occasions when you need specific pre-programmed messages. All mod- els use digitized speech, similar to answering machines and voice mail services. They are a more affordable op- tion to high tech devices described below, however they do not offer the same flexibility as the high tech de- vices. These low tech devices may offer as few as one to four, and as many as 32 messages on one display. Some devices come with six, eight, or 12 \"levels\". That is, a unique, different message display is created for each level and each level includes a different set of messages. This is useful for people who need more than eight or 32 messages in total, but cannot cope with any more than eight or 32 at one time. You simply switch to a new display representing a different conversational topic, change the level on the device by turning a knob, hitting a botton or a switch, and you now have more messages available. Specialized Telephone Equipment If you are unable to lift a phone receiver and/or dial a phone number, special phone services are available plus an operator dialing service. There is also a hands-free speaker phone, activated by a voice commands, or by hitting a single switch. Ask an occupational thera- pist for more information about what is available in your area. High-Tech Strategies If you are interested in a high-tech communication sys- tem, information about systems that meet your prefer- ences, your needs and functional abilities should be discussed with an SLP or AAC Team. These systems can be very expensive and there is a wide range of devices available. They vary in size, function, application, and operation. Some function by text-to-speech; that is you simply type your message and the device speaks it for you. Some will store commonly used messages, phrases,PGS 36 44 Als Manual .e$S_Layout 1 12-07-03 3:41 PM Page 14ALS. Three letters that change people's lives.

They tend to be rugged and travel well. They produce a synthesized (artificial) speech. Some offer both synthesized and digitized speech (recorded messages). Others now include email and internet op- tions. They can be used on the telephone, with a group of people, or in quiet face to face conversations. Re- cently, portable devices such as the iproducts with speech output applications are also available. Although not specifically made for people with communication impairments, they offer a more affordable option if ap- propriate. These systems work well for individuals who still have good hand dexterity and strength. Computers Computers can be used for both face to face communi- cation and for written communication. Special soft- ware is loaded on the computer to provide speech output and to accommodate for changing physical abili- ties. They are particularly useful for people who con- tinue to work. Computers are less portable than a device designed specifically for communication. Even laptops tend to be less portable because they are bulkier and more diffi- cult to mount on a wheelchair than a dedicated com- munication device. However, iPads and e-readers are very portable. Computers can be slow to start-up and batteries do not last as long as the dedicated devices, but the iproduct batteries do. Intergrated Systems Integrated systems combine a fully operational com- puter and face to face communication system all in one device. They allow multiple options for use that can adapt to changing needs, some of which include touch screen, standard hand held mouse, head mouse, switches and even a camera that tracks eye movement.you. Some will store commonly used messages, phrases, and/or words. You choose the messages that you wish to store with the assistance of the SLP . To operate, you select the combinations you want and it speaks for you. Many systems offer text-to-speech and pre-stored mes- sages. Rate enhancement features appear on most of these high tech devices. The three most common rate enhance- ment features include word completion, word predic- tion, abbreviation expansion, and a menu of the most commonly used 100 or so words. Word completion: special software loaded in the sys- tem predicts the word you are starting to input after one or two letter selections. Typically three to eight possible words are displayed for selection. The options change each time a new letter is entered. Word prediction: upon completing a word, the special software predicts the next word based on commonly used phrases. Again, three to eight possible words are displayed for selection. Some systems even learn the words you use most often. This makes communication much faster. Abbreviation-expansion: allows the person using a device to use short cuts to speak longer messages. A common one we use in writing is \"ASAP\" meaning \"as soon as possible\". Again this makes communication much faster. Commonly used words: These words are always present on the system for the person to use instead of spelling them. It is much faster to select a frequently used word (for example the five \"W\" questions-Who?What? Where? Why? When?) than to spell it out letter by letter. Most of these systems can accommodate for changing physical abilities. In the beginning the person with ALS may be able to operate the devices with his/or her hands. The devices can be programmed to accept the lightest of touch should the hands become weaker. Later, if that is no longer an option, the device can be operated by other parts of the body using a switch, mouse, or joystick, head movement, or eyegaze.

A Manual for People Living with ALS ADAPTING TO CHANGES IN SPEECH AND MAINTAINING COMMUNICATION SUB-SECTION 00 50 Final Note on Communication... Although changes in speech and communication func - tion can occur with ALS, when and how your func - tional speech will change cannot be predicted specifically. However, it is important to know what to look for and how to adapt to changes that happen. Remaining communicative will have a large impact on your quality of life. Make sure you openly discuss communication is - sues and adaptive strategies with members of your healthcare team, especially the SLP , before you have lost substantial speech function. An SLP or assis - tive technology expert with expertise in AAC assess - ments and training will be best able to help you make decisions about what AAC strategies are right for you and your communication partners. Addressing AAC issues early will enable you to feel better prepared and comfortable when changes occur. PGS 36 44 Als Manual .e$S_Layout 1 12-07-03 3:41 PM Page 16ALS.

FOREVER.0051ADAPTING TO CHANGES IN BREATHING AND MAINTAINING LUNG FUNCTION SUB-SECTIONA Manual for People Living with ALSbronchi, the largest air passages in your lungs, and then into the small air sacs (alveoli) which pass fresh oxy- gen(O2) to the blood. This process is called inspira- tion. When you breathe out, both diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, and the lung recoils decreas- ing the size of your chest cavity. Used air that contains waste carbon dioxide (CO2) is cleared from your lungs. This process is called expiration. If you are breathing heavily, two additional muscle groups come into play: when you take a deep breath in, muscles in the neck that attach to the collarbone and upper ribs assist in breathing; and when you force a breath out, your abdominal muscles help to push up the diaphragm. You can see that there is a great deal of voluntary mus- cle involvement in the act of breathing. Since ALS is a disease that causes muscle atrophy (wasting) and weak- ness, it is easy to understand that changes in breathing will occur, even though your lung tissue may be very healthy. Individuals with pre-existing lung disease may be more affected. Signs and Symptoms of weakened Breathing Muscles Shortness of Breath with Activity Shortness of breath may be the first symptom of the weakening of breathing muscles. You may notice short- ness of breath after rushing upstairs, carrying a load, etc. Shortness of breath can also occur with no particu- lar exertion; you may not be able to walk or talk for long without becoming winded. You should tell your doctor about these symptoms. When you experience shortness of breath, stop what you are doing. Shortness of breath will disappear when activity is reduced. Relax in one of the following positions if you are able and breathe slowly and deeply. Sit at a table, lean forward with a straight back and rest your head and shoulders on a pillow on the table. Sit on a chair or the edge of your bed, lean forward, keep your back straight and rest your elbows and fore- arms on your thighs. Lean against a wall with your feet about 12 inches from the wall. Rest your lower back against the wall and lean your upper back away from the wall.If you are living with ALS, you may or may not have started to notice some changes in your breathing. While ALS does not impair the lungs themselves, the muscles involved in breathing, coughing and swallowing safely will become affected over time. Breathing may be significantly impaired without com- plaints of breathlessness due to the reduction of physi- cally demanding activities, or wheel chair use. Impairments may not be detected until there is a lunginfection likely occurring because of limited breathing and coughing ability. Poor breathing function leaves a person with ALS feel- ing fatigued, short of breath, and more prone to respi-ratory infections and respiratory failure. Therefore, a vital part of the ALS disease management plan is to monitor breathing function throughout the course of the disease. However, the reality is that thebest way and when to address respiratory issues in ALS remains uncertain and is practised differently across the world. Methods used to monitor lung function vary among doctors even in the same country, or city. Nonetheless, most ALS clinical specialists believe regu- lar monitoring promotes early detection of breathing problems, prevention of unnecessary emergencies, and opens the door for making decisions about therapeutic options available to you in a timely manner. This publication will explain the breathing process and provide overviews of symptoms of changes in breath- ing, tests that may be used to monitor breathing func- tion, respiratory infections, airway management techniques, and options for mechanical ventilation and the decision-making process. Another publication you may find helpful, which includes anatomical diagrams and pictures of various ventilatory support equipment, is Breathe Easy: Respiratory Care in Neuromuscular Disorders. This is available through the MDA in the United States or as a download at http://mda.org/pub - lications/PDFs/BreatheEasyBooklet.pdf. Normal \"easy\" breathing involves two main muscle groups. When you breathe in, the diaphragm moves down; at the same time the intercostal muscles be- tween your ribs contract to pull your rib cage up and out. These two actions cause a partial vacuum.

FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSADAPTING TO CHANGES IN BREATHING AND MAINTAINING LUNG FUNCTION SUB-SECTION 0052Fatigue Fatigue, or tiredness, is a common symptom of ALS. It is caused by a number of factors. As ALS attacks your motor neurons, they become unable to send commands from your brain to the muscle cells that they control. Asmaller number of muscle cells must then try to per-form jobs usually done by the full number. The result isthat your muscles tire before they normally would. When your respiratory muscles are affected by ALS, you may be less able to clear the amount of CO2 youneed to and therefore O2 may also be reduced. Whenactivity increases, it becomes more difficult for the lungs to supply enough oxygen to the body. Othermetabolic changes take place and you feel fatigued. Besides the physiological changes that may cause fa-tigue, ALS produces many changes in your life. Changeoften results in general stress that can also manifest it- self as fatigue. Do what you can to prevent getting tired. Rest when you begin to feel tired. Try to keepyour exertion within the limits that your body is nowimposing. Pay attention to signals like fatigue. It may be necessary for you to change your priorities and foregoless important activities. Plan your day to include regu- lar rest periods. Morning Fatigue Some people with ALS experience morning fatigue.You may wake up feeling tired, sometimes with aheadache, and the feeling that you slept poorly. This may be caused by obstructive sleep apnea and/or under-ventilation and it is important to tell your doc-tor. Obstructive sleep apnea: Weakened (bulbar) muscles of the upper throat and pharynx may result in noisy breathing, snoring, or closing off the upper airway while sleeping. This is what is called sleep apnea and is characterized by intermittent reduction or stopping of breathing. A decrease in the oxygen (O2) saturation of the blood can result. Hypoventilation: The relaxation of nerve and muscle functions during sleep may lead to smaller breaths (hypoventilation) causing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels to rise. For example, when you stand upright, the di- aphragm moves down when you breathe in. When youlie down, the organs in your abdomen press against the diaphragm, and more strength is required for the di- aphragm to move down during breathing. To help cope with this problem, you may want to try to raise your head and shoulders during sleep. It is best to raise the whole torso by using blocks under bed 4\" to 6\" high, a wedge pillow 6-8\" at its highest point, or a mechanical bed. If you do not have access to the best solutions, try putting two or more pillows under your head and shoulders until you do. Obstructive sleep apnea and under-ventilation often occur together, therefore, nocturnal oximetry or a sleep study may be advised (see Monitoring Your Breathing Function). Excess Mucus and Secretions In some people, excess mucus and secretions can build up to the point where they cannot be easily cleared by coughing. This is particularly the case first thing in the morning when secretions have built up during the night. If you experience this problem, ask your doctor for a referral to a physiotherapist or respiratory thera- pist to instruct you in methods to loosen secretions and bring them to the mouth to be spit out. One method of dealing with mucus and saliva build-up is suctioning. Suction equipment acts very much like a dentist's suction tube; it consists of a motor, collection bottle, tubing and catheters. However, some healthcare professionals believe suctioning may be counter-pro- ductive for persons with ALS. Talk to your respiratory therapist or respirologist about whether suctioning may be right for you, and if there is anything else you can do to reduce mucous build-up, such as assisted cough techniques (see more later in this publication) or use of medica- tions such as Amitryptilline, Transderm V , Atropine, Glycopyrolate, and beta blockers.

Signs and symptoms of weak - ness in the breathing muscles can be subtle and missed if not specifically assessed. Repeating PFTs every three to six months may be advised to assess for any decline in the respiratory sys - tem to guide your doctor about when to discuss certain interventions such as airway management techniques, or noninvasive ventilation in as timely a manner as pos - sible. The following are some of the measurements used to assess lung function. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) FVC is the volume of air that can be maximally, force - fully exhaled following maximal inspiratory effort. The test generally involves having you sit with your trunk el - evated to between 30 to 90 degrees, putting a mouth - piece in your mouth, a nose clip on your nose, and breathing into a spirometer that may either be a simple hand held unit or a computerized machine. After tak - ing as deep a breath as you can, you blow out quickly and as hard as you can for one-to-two seconds. If your lips are weak, you will be provided a lip seal mouthpiece or mask to promote an accurate measurement. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) PEFR is the highest rate of expiratory (out) airflow you can generate ( peak expiratory flow ) following maximal inspiratory (in) effort. Flow rate can be meas - ured at the same time as FVC using spirometry with flow volume loops. This is closely related to Peak Cough Flow (PCF) which tends to be slightly greater. PCF can also be measured at home using an inexpen - sive hand held peak flow meter commonly used by people with asthma. Normal PCF values would be 360 to 720 Litres per minute (L/min). The minimum effec - tive PCF is 160 to 200 L/min (recognizing that some smaller individuals may manage with lower values). PCF is highly dependent on the function of those mus - cles in the mouth, throat and larynx (bulbar muscles/bulbar function). The greater the bulbar im - pairment is, the lower these measures become. is closed by force. The glottis is then suddenly opened and a very high velocity flow of air is pushed from the lungs and up the airway. Any mucus or food in one of the air passages is forced out as well. People with ALS have normal cough reflexes, but the muscles involved may be weakened and unable to produce a strong enough cough. You can strengthen your cough using techniques mentioned later in this section. You will need to consult with a skilled professional to train you and your family. There is a variety of methods to choose from to monitor the breathing function of a person with ALS. Physicians vary in their approach, so keep that in mind as you read this section. If you have not had your breathing function monitored, use this ed - ucational tool to open a dialogue with your doctor. Since ALS is a progressive disease, it is helpful to assess pulmonary function early on in the disease, so that there is a baseline pulmonary function test (PFT) result, or starting point, to which follow-up assessments every few months can be compared. Without monitor - ing, a person with ALS could seemingly experience sud - den respiratory failure without having had the benefit of advance planning regarding breathing support like mechanical ventilation options.

FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSADAPTING TO CHANGES IN BREATHING AND MAINTAINING LUNG FUNCTION SUB-SECTION 0054Maximum Inspiratory Force(MIF)/ Maximum Expiratory (MIF) or maximum in- spiratory pressure (MIP) is the greatest force gener- ated by the muscles of inspiration (breathing in), primarily the diaphragm, but also other accessory mus- cles. A pressure measuring device (manometer) is at- tached to a mouth-piece and the individual is instructedto breathe in as forcefully as possible without using the cheeks (the cheek muscles can falsely indicate a muchhigher pressure). Maximum expiratory force (MEF) or maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) is the greatest force gen- erated by the muscles of expiration (breathing out), pri-marily the abdominal muscles. These too may be muchweakened in ALS. These muscles and their pressure measurement are important in the prediction of an ade-quate cough. Remember, an adequate cough helps to clear airways. Maximum pressures of less than 40 - 50 cm H2O are of some concern as they may be a sign of less respira- tory reserve and some limitation of ventilation or cough ability. Arterial Blood Oxygen Saturation (SaO 2) A noninvasive way to measure oxygen saturation is touse an oximeter device which involves attaching small sensors to a pulse point on a person's body (e.g., finger tip) to transmit oxygen saturation readings. Normal levels of oxygen saturation are above 95%. Lower than expected levels of oxygen saturation in the blood (SaO 2)may indicate areas of loss of volume in the lungs (atelectasis) or when associated with illness may indicate pneumonia. Less commonly a low saturation can indicate that not enough CO2is being cleared (hy- poventilation). Hypoventilation often begins, or is worse during sleep. Nocturnal oximetry, is an over-night assessment used as an alternative to a full sleep study (polysomno- gram) when problems associated with night-time (noc- turnal) apneas (short periods of time when breathing stops), or hypoventilation are evident. Sleep studies,conducted over-night in a sleep laboratory, are not commonly performed in ALS management, but in some cases of suspected obstructive sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoventilation they may be advised. Common respiratory illnesses can cause complications in persons with ALS. To reduce your odds of infec- tion, try to avoid contact with people who have colds or flu. Be sure to practise regular hand-washing. BronchitisBronchitis is an inflammation and irritation of the bronchial tubes in the lungs characterized by a cough. This condition may be caused by viruses, bacteria, envi- ronmental irritants such as cigarette smoke, or allergies. In response to the inflammation, airways secrete a sticky mucous. If a person is unable to produce an ef- fective cough to clear the lungs, there is a risk for devel- oping pneumonia.Note: The Relationship Between Monitoring Breathing and Feeding Tube Placement Another reason respiratory monitoring is important is related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube placement. About 50% of peo- ple with ALS choose to have PEG tubes. What may be over-looked is that a minimal degree of respi- ratory function is necessary in order to under-go the procedure in a safe, uncomplicated manner. It has been recommended that PEG tubes be seri- ously considered at an FVC of about 50%. Some in- dividuals may continue to swallow very safely, but have a progressive and significant decline in their res- piratory function. This means that some individuals who are not at significant risk for aspiration may still need a PEG tube earlier than they would need for swallowing alone because the safe placement de- pends on their breathing function. In such cases, the tube can remain unused (aside from periodic flush- ing) until required from the perspective of safe swal- lowing or nutritional supplementation. Medications that patients may have difficulty swallowing may be given through the tube even if not needed for nutri- tion.

For more information about many of the techniques, talk to a respiratory therapist, respirologist, or phys- iotherapist . Baseline pulmonary function and a respira- tory assessment are recommended. Deep Breathing Exercise Exercises to use full lung capacity can compensate for weakened muscles. This can be achieved with the fol- lowing deep breathing exercise: 1. Sit at a table, hunched over slightly with your weight supported on your hands or elbows. This position expands the rib cage for larger breaths by allowing your shoulder and neck muscles to assist your breathing. 2. Breathe in as deeply as possible, hold the breath for a few seconds, and then exhale. 3. Repeat several times. Some doctors believe that patients who do deep- breathing exercises are less prone to lung infections and partial lung collapse. Ask your physiotherapist to demonstrate an exercise routine and advise you about the use of exercise devices. Assisted Cough Techniques Without Devices Assisted coughing is a technique where a caregiver ap- plies forceful pressure to the abdomen and occasionally the chest wall, timed to the effort of coughing. This action assists the weakened muscles responsible for an effective cough. These techniques are very helpful, effective and easily learned. They are very empow- ering and relieving for caregivers who, without them, feel powerless to assist their loved ones in their respiratory distress. 1.Abdominal thrust: Just immediately prior to a timed cough effort the caregiver applies rapid and forceful pressure to the upper abdomen in an inward and upward fashion between the bottom of the breast bone and the navel (umbilicus). If you do get a fever with thick discoloured, or bloodymucus coughed from the chest, or if you notice thatthe mucus has changed from clear white to yellowish,tell your doctor immediately. These could be symptoms of a respiratory infection that could lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria or viruses, and may be a complication of a cold, flu, bronchitis, or as- piration. Pneumonia causes the very small air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) and surrounding tissues to fill with inflammatory cells (pus) and mucous which prevents the normal exchange of O2 and CO2. When this oc- curs oxygen is not taken adequately through the alveoliinto the blood and a low oxygen level may result. Aspiration Aspiration occurs when liquids or solids get into the airways and block airflow and gas exchanges (O 2/CO2), cause irritation, or carry infection from the mouth and gums. Small amounts of aspirated material can be coughed out. If aspiration is frequent and in-volves large amounts of material, an evaluation by a swallowing specialist (speech language pathologist with expertise) and respiratory consultant is advised. Changes in nutrition and swallowing techniques may be recommended. Preventative airway management measures initi- ated at an early stage can prevent unnecessary hos- pital emergency visits and intensive care unit admissions. Airway management strategies are used to either enhance your ability to recruit (take in) air vol- ume into the lungs or cough effectively. Strategies range from self-care techniques to the use of assistive devices. Incorporating airway management strategies can promote better lung function longer, and thus pro- mote quality of life. Lung Volume Recruitment (LVR) and Assisted Coughing Strategies Before trying any assistive breathing and coughing techniques, make sure to discuss them with your healthcare professional.

FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSADAPTING TO CHANGES IN BREATHING AND MAINTAINING LUNG FUNCTION SUB-SECTION 00562.Lateral costal compression: Sometimes combined with the abdominal thrust, or used alone when a PEG tube has recently been introduced. Firm but not too forceful pressure is applied by each hand on the lower rib cage below the breasts or at the sides of the chest timed to a cough effort. 3.Self-assist: This is most appropriate for paraplegic patients and would rarely be used by ALS patients. The individual in a stable wheel chair takes a full breath in, folds their arms across their abdomen and forcefully pitches their torso forward over their crossed arms. Once a significant pressure has been generated in the abdomen and chest they release the glottis and cough. Assistive Cough Techniques With Devices 1.Modified resuscitation bag: A special hand-held bag is usually used for resuscitation (start up breathing again) in a respiratory or cardiac arrest. This useful tool can be modified with the addition of one-way valve tubing and a mouth-piece (or mask) to allow the passive introduction (by one's self or a caregiver) of volumes of air into the lungs. This allows re-achieving volumes which have been lost due to muscle weakness. Its effectiveness is directly dependent on bulbar function. Once a larger volume has been accommodated then an abdominal thrust (as above) can be added to enhance the effectiveness of the cough. 2.\"CoughAssist\" (Mechanical in-exsufflation machine) : This is a very effective device for those who maintain sufficient bulbar function but have a weak cough. It is a vacuum that allows attachment through a face mask to both the positive pressure side (to help inflate the lungs) and the negative pres sure side of the vacuum (to fill up the lungs and then forcefully empty them to mimic an effective cough). The high speed expiratory flow is effective in clearing airway secretions. Considerable experience is required in the assessment and introduction of this device and it is quite costly. 3.Volume ventilator: For people who are already using a volume ventilator for mouth-piece ventilation, the volume of an assisted breath can be held by the glottis and added to the next machine- delivered breath achieving a breath-stacking effect. This improves both the volume (range of motion) of the lungs (and thorax) and the effectiveness of the cough. Again this is most effective with maintained bulbar function. Lifestyle Strategies Do not smoke In addition to all of the other problems smoking causes, it reduces lung capacity. It can also cause in- creased phlegm that some patients will have difficulty clearing from their airways. Be cautious with alcohol and sedatives Alcohol and sedatives may increase the risk of aspira- tion or hypoventilation during sleep. Avoid allergens If you are allergic to pet dander or dust mites, make sure your home is free of pets that cause you problems and is regularly dusted. Investing in an air purifier with a HEPA filter can help keep the air free of particles that irritate your airways. Failure of the respiratory muscles is an eventual result of ALS. The breathing muscles become too weak to expand the lungs and to provide an adequate cough, thus requiring assisted breathing support. The decision of whether or not to use breathing support is yours, but it is a decision you should make only after consult- ing with your family, doctor, and other healthcare team members. The choice to use breathing support will have important consequences for your way of life and that of your family and caregivers. You will have to de- cide whether you are willing to accommodate your life and that of your family to the potential dependence on a breathing support apparatus. This decision must be made well before life-support ventilation is needed. It is also important to have a clear understanding of what is covered by your available health insurance/ben- efits.

It is recognized that fewer than 5% of ALS patients choose to under-go tracheostomy placement. The surgeon creates an opening in the neck connecting directly to the windpipe or trachea. In the surgical opening a curved plastic tube is put in place. This tube is connected to a hose and volume ventilator, which assists with breathing. Whenever necessary, a suctioning catheter can be inserted into the tube in the trachea to remove secretions. Most patients with a tra - cheostomy have a feeding tube (PEG tube) as well. Prior to making a decision about invasive ventila - tion both you and your family should learn from a doctor about the full implications of invasive venti - lation. This will require full time, 24 hour support from trained caregivers. Can you count upon the assistance of family members? It is a full-time job for three peo - ple, assuming eight-hour shifts. Provided you have lim - ited bulbar involvement speaking can continue through the use of a tracheostomy speaking valve such as the Passy-Muir\u00ae valve but most patients with ALS and a tracheostomy are unable to communicate verbally. Making Your Decision About Ventilation In summary, it is best to learn what you can about ven - tilation options early on in the disease prior to an emer - gency. Planning ahead enables you to be in more control. Communicate your wishes regarding use of a ventilator in a personal healthcare directive (Durable Power of Attorney) and ensure that your advocate is agreeable to supporting your decisions. Be sure to provide your doctor with a copy of the directive (see \"Financial and Legal Considerations section) and inform your family members where you keep it at home. Without a directive and making your wishes known, you can probably assume invasive ventilation with tra - cheostomy will be initiated in the event of a respiratory crisis. This could put you and your family in a serious position which you may have chosen to avoid. One of the most difficult circumstances occurs when an indi - vidual with ALS fails to engage in this decision-making process and experiences invasive ventilation and ICU admission when, if properly engaged and informed, they would not have chosen to do so. We readily make Non-Invasive Ventilation Non-invasive ventilation is achieved with a bi-level unit, a positive pressure volume ventilator, or much less commonly, a negative pressure ventilator. The most common breathing support is the bi-level (com - monly known brand name product is the BiPap TM ). The bi-level helps you breathe by providing two levels of air pressure. A higher pressure when you inhale as - sists weak inspiratory muscles and a lower pressure when you exhale. A circuit of tubing is used to deliver air from the bi-level to your interface (a mask over nose or nose and mouth). Non-invasive ventilation is often initiated at night only. The practice of daily non-invasive lung hygiene techniques such as lung volume recruitment with as - sisted cough is a must when opting for non-invasive ventilation. As the disease progresses increased breath - ing support will be required. This may be provided by using a mouth piece during the day with a volume ven - tilator and a different interface for night time use. Your respiratory therapist will assist you in finding the appro - priate interfaces. Although some individuals using non-invasive ventila - tion may eventually rely on it 24 hours per day this is very difficult and cannot be sustained for extended pe - riods of time. When someone does require non-inva - sive ventilation greater than 16 hours per day, it is likely they will soon need to make a decision about whether or not they want to continue with mechanical ventila - tion requiring a tracheostomy. A small number of pa - tients who retain their ability to speak clearly, swallow easily and clear their airway effectively may be able to use a chair-mounted volume ventilator to assist breath - ing through a mouth-piece rather than a mask. This re - quires a respiratory team with experience in mouth-piece ventilation but may prevent the need for a tracheostomy and significantly prolong survival. If an individual becomes highly dependent on a ventilator and not able to breathe independently, then non-inva - sive ventilation will require a ventilator (or bilevel de - vice) with alarms and an internal battery in case of power failure or disconnect.

We readily make plans for our finances in our wills; why should we not make clear decisions about our care while we are able? If at any time you decide you are interested in any form of breathing support, you should be referred to a respirolo - gist. withdrawal of Invasive Ventilation A very small number of individuals will accept invasive ventilation under any circumstances and others, rarely, on a temporary basis only if it is highly likely that they will recover and no longer need it. Invasive ventilation can and should be withdrawn if it is in any way against the wishes of the individual or if they have become \"locked- in\" and are unable to manage any communication. Any uncomfortable symptoms or pain or breathlessness will be managed with pain medications (narcotics) and seda - tives (benzodiazepines). Managing symptoms, including those experienced in the withdrawal of ventilatory sup - port are fundamental to the provision of Palliative Care. Final Note on Breathing Management... If you didn't know before reading this section, you now know breathing management plays a major role in ALS man - agement and enhancing quality of life. Monitoring your breathing function is very important for identifying problems early. Early detection is critical because there are things you can do to reduce risk of infection, promote better ventilation for longer, and possibly extend your survival. Many decisions about interventions may need to be made along the way. Having good information about what is avail - able to you and discussing options with your family and healthcare professionals will help you to make decisions that will be best for you.

Very thick mucus canalso build up in the mouth, making the problem worse.This build-up of saliva can cause choking and disruptsleep. Relief may come from home remedies, over-the-count- er products, and prescription drugs and, in extremecases, even surgical procedures. Advice should beobtained from your doctor and/or your local pharma-cist. A side effect of drugs to relieve a build-up ofsaliva is \"dry mouth.\" It's a question of finding theright balance for you. The following have proven helpful for managing saliva: Portable suction machine (check with your doctor before purchase as suctioning may be counter-pro-ductive in ALS) Decongestants and over-the-counter medicationsused for colds and allergies Antidepressants - Amitriptyline may reduce saliva andenable sleep Anticholinergic drugs to reduce spasms of smoothmuscle in the bronchi and decrease gastric, bronchialand salivary secretions Transderm V patches usually used for motion sick-ness also tend to dry up saliva The following have been shown to be helpful for treat-ing thick mucus: Apple juice, grape juice, or hot tea with lemon SSK1 (potassium iodide) 10 drops in a glass of watertwo to three times per day. This may take one to twoweeks to be effective. A prescription is required An expectorant cough syrup Meat tenderizer mixed with a little water can be usedto coat the tongue or can be placed under the tongue Papaya extract placed on the tongue may prove help-ful Precautions: Some of the suggestions for saliva man- agement include use of medication.

Bacteria can causebleeding gums, bone loss, mouth and tooth infections. There are many products available to make oral care easier. Assistance with oral hygiene can greatly impact one's selfesteem and dignity. Here are some issues that you need to be aware of and tips on promoting good oral health. Going to the Dentist Not many dentists will know about ALS, its effect on your ability to keep your teeth clean, excess saliva orthe precautions they should take because of a patient'sswallowing problems. Make your dentist fully aware ofthese problems. Continue with regular dental cleaningsfor as long as possible at your family dental care office.Consult your dental hygienist for preventative homecare instructions. Mouth Freshness An applicator with lemon and water can be used to keep the mouth fresh. You can also try an oral rinsesuch as Biotene or non-alcohol mouthwashes. Furry Tongue Some individuals with ALS with bulbar symptoms develop a furry tongue. Water may be used to clean the tongue with an applicator or washcloth. If the tongue appears white for any length of time, consult your doc- tor or dentist. Sometimes a condition called 'thrush'can develop. It is a fungal infection and is easily treat- ed.ORAL HEALTH ISSUES2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 76ALS.

If you have excesssaliva and are still able to eat by mouth, mixing moresaliva with your food makes it both easier to swallowand digest. Dry MouthAlthough management of saliva is common in many people with ALS, especially those with difficulty swal-lowing, some are troubled by excessive mouth dryness.A dry mouth can cause thick mucus to form, whichmay in turn cause serious choking problems. Excessive dryness is usually caused by one or more of the following: Breathing mostly through the mouth, rather than thenose can dry out the lining in your mouth. If youconsistently wake up with a dry mouth, thick mucusand/or a sore throat, you may be breathing throughyour mouth while sleeping A side effect from some surgical operations Stress from chronic anxiety or depression A side effect from some medications The natural process of aging Smoking The following have proven helpful for a dry mouth: Make a conscious effort to breathe through your nose If you suffer from nasal congestion, ask your doctorfor assistance (nasal congestion leading to a dry mouth can cause thick mucus to form, which in turnmay cause choking problems) Increase your liquid intake (ask your speech patholo-gist and dietitian which consistency is best for you) Use a vaporizer (clean the vaporizer once a week with vinegar and water)Ask your pharmacist about oral rinses, artificial salivaspray, and tablets Toothbrushes and Flossers If you have weakened hands and arms, an electric toothbrush is ideal for brushing your teeth. There are a variety of electric brush shapes and price ranges: Oral B, Philips Sensonic, Colgate and Crest spin brush-es. Others may find that a toothbrush is very helpfulfor removing build-up, which occurs on the teeth, par-ticularly after tube feeding. There are many brusheswidely available and a soft bristle brush is always rec-ommended to minimize tissue trauma. Newer to themarket are both manual and electric flossing aids: Reach Access, Butler Floss Handle and the Oral BHumming Bird Flosser. Proper Brushing Technique: 1.Place the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to the gum-line. 2.Use a gentle circular motion several times in the same spot. 3.Finish with a sweep of the brush from the gum-line to the chewing surface of the tooth. 4.Repeat this method as you brush from the right to the left side of the mouth. Also be sure to brush the inner surfaces of the teeth.If a caregiver is brushing for you, the handle of a softgrip toothbrush could be used as a mouth prop toassist access.

In healthcare terms, end-of-life is the stage in a per- son's life where death is expected within a short period of time (e.g., within six months or less) barring the use of life sustaining interventions. In personal terms, end-of-life may begin at diagnosis for some and not until the final days for others. Regardless of when you believe the end-of-life stage is, making decisions about the kind of care you want at the end-of-life and the provisions you want to make for your surviving family members should take place much earlier. Contemplating the End-of-Life Phase Acceptance Typically, over time, accepting that life is coming to a physical end may become less difficult. The functional and role changes associated with ALS often provide opportunity for reflection of one's past, present, and future. During reflection of one's life journey, feelings of greif and loss may be experienced. Acceptance is one of the stages of grief one passes through along the journey. Sometimes we accept things, then go back to denial, or anger, and sometimes, work our way back to some form of acceptance. ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.0063APPROACHING END-OF-LIFE ISSUES AND ADVANCE CARE PLANNING SUB-SECTIONA Manual for People Living with ALSConditions, such as ALS, often described as fatal, or terminal, could perhaps better be described as \"life-shortening.\" The only true fatal condi- tion there is, is life itself. End-of-life issues including organizing financial and legal affairs and determining your wishes for medical interventions are things all of us need to address no matter what the status of our health is today. However, unless we are knowingly in our last phase of life, most of us would prefer not to talk about it, much less plan for it. How we deal with death can be deeply influenced by our cultural and religious values. Some cultures view death as a welcomed spiritual transition. Others believe that death and rebirth are a continual process. Duringour lives, the cells in our bodies die at an ever-increas- ing rate, while at the same time our learning, intelli-gence and spiritual awareness can continue to grow. for many, the final stage of life can be a time of tremendous personal growth previously not expe- rienced. Accepting that time is limited can motivate one to really make a difference in one's life and those around them. This time of life can be a very special gift. Approaching the end-of-life phase in a positive, well-thought out way, can make for a good death which can help provide comfort to surviving friends and family members. The information in this booklet encompasses end-of- life concepts, advance care planning, and ideas fortelling one's life story As ALS progresses, there are numerous practical issues to deal with and arrangements to be made. It is often difficult for a family to talk openly about these practi- cal matters such as financial changes, tax issues, insur- ance, medical and personal care choices, a will and funeral arrangements, as well as distribution of assets and belongings. It is best to discuss and plan for the decisions you need to make well before death is near. Poor communica- tion and planning of these practical concerns could force family members to make decisions on your behalf without knowing your wishes. This may strain relationships, cause unnecessary financialWHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT ITAPPROACHING THE CONCEPT OF END-OF-LIFE2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 80ALS.

FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSAPPROACHING END-OF-LIFE ISSUES AND ADVANCE CARE PLANNING SUB-SECTION 0064Instead of looking at oneself as dying, it may be easier to consider yourself as being in the finalstage of life. Therefore, the focus is on living. Once one accepts that the natural progression of their illnessis a shortened life, their acceptance can help prepareand comfort those around them. A sense of peaceabout death can open up opportunities for deep andmeaningful communication and planning for what is tocome. Expectations of the dying Process For individuals are facing death, and those aroundthem, uncertainty about what happens during the lastdays and hours of the dying process may cause fearand anxiety. To minimize these fears, and/or anxieties,it is best to ask your doctor and nurse what to expect of the dying process and if there are spe-cific expectations for someone with ALS as opposed to someone without. If you have contactwith a palliative care/hospice doctor or nurse, or pas-toral care professional ask them to describe to youwhat the dying process will be like and what supportswill be there for you and your loved ones. Have thefamily members you expect to be with you be part ofthe discussion. They may have fears and questionsthey will also want to address. A video that may alsobe of help, \"facing the fears-Making the Journey,\" is available through the Canadian Hospice and Palliative Care Association (http://www.chpca.net ). Also ask your doctor or nurse what factors mayimpact your comfort during the dying process.The answers you get to your questions will help youmake decisions about specific aspects of care you wantdocumented in your advance directive to ensure a\"good\" death. Experiencing A Good death \"He died peacefully.\" Undoubtedly, we have all heard this phrase. Unfortunately, we have also heard of other stories where people did not die this way. Withgaining acceptance and appreciation of the palliative care and hospice movement in our society, we hope tohear more stories about \"dying well.\" The goal of pal- liative care is to provide comfort. Dying well alsoincludes experiencing a death that is dignified by fulfill-ing expressed health and personal care wishes of thedying person.We can take control in advance to promote a gooddeath for ourselves. Some of the things that can helpare: Making peace with family and friends, if needed Exploring spirituality and faith Completing an advance care plan and sharing it with family, doctor, and clergy Communicating openly with loved ones about thedesired environment for the last days or hours of life Advance care planning can avert potentially difficult situations for family members. Limiting the numberand type of decisions others have to make on one'sbehalf can substantially reduce their stress and tensionlevels. However, once plans have been made, decisionsshould be revisited every so often to make sure theplan is still desirable and to make changes if necessary. Advance care planning can be started as soon as you are ready, and may include choices no differ-ent from before you had ALS. Regularly reviewing your advance care plan to reflect your current outlookallows you, your alternate decision maker (Proxy,Representative, Power of Attorney for Health Care),and the healthcare team to become comfortable withyour choices. Legal and financial planning information is discussed in detail in Section 6, Legal and Financial Considerations. The two advance care planning areas of focus in this sub-section are: end-of-life care choices and bereavement planning. End-of-Life Care Choices Explicit instructions in an advance care plan should help to ensure a dying person is treated according to their wishes and will have a dignified death as definedby them. Completing an advance care plan andappointing a substitute decision maker (\"proxy) in alegal document, frequently called a \"power of attor- ney for health care,\" in the event one is unable, or too sick to communicate their wishes for care is criti-cal. Wishes expressed in a an advance care plan can beas specific as the individual wants them to be. Whenpreparing how you want to be cared for in your finalADVANCE PLANNING2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 81at given stages of your ALS progression, it is you who will decide when to suspend these treatments.Decisions about medical interventions geared toextend life are very personal and should be based onmedical information, financial resources, caregiver sup-port and resources, and your perceived quality of life. It is critical to periodically review advance care plans. While quality of life means something different to every single person, it can also change meaningwithin an individual over time. For instance, a personwith ALS may indicate at one point that in the event ofrespiratory failure they do not wish to use mechanicalventilation. However, that same person may changetheir mind when they hear there is a new grandchild onthe way and that mechanical ventilation in the event ofrespiratory failure would ensure being able to live andgreet the new member of the family. On the contrary,someone with a PEG and/or ventilatory support maydecide they no longer want to live with those interven-tions if a given situation were to arise. It is important for professional caregivers to periodically reviewtheir patients' advance directives with them and discuss what they are presently feeling about theirchoices. Three major intervention issues that ought to be addressed in an advance care plan are: Resuscitation: Ask yourself whether or not you want to be resuscitated in the event of respiratory failure. Ask your doctor about how to obtain a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order, if that is what you prefer. Life-extending interventions such as feeding tubes and mechanical ventilation: A sample advance care plan that focuses on PEG and mechanical ventilation,designed by the University of Washington for patientswith ALS, is referenced in Section 6, Legal and Financial Considerations. This document may help you make your decisions and assist you with wording to useif you are required to use a specific form recognizedby your Province. Pain management: Stating one's desire to have pain appropriately monitored and treated is very important. Discuss with your health care team how you would likeany pain controlled. ALS.

Keep a copy in a safe, easily accessible place at home that your caregivers know about. 3. Give a copy to your doctor for your medical chart and your appointed decision-maker(s). 4. Carry a wallet sized card with you that names your appointed alternate decision making and their contact information, in the event of a medical emergency outside the home. 5.

FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSAPPROACHING END-OF-LIFE ISSUES AND ADVANCE CARE PLANNING SUB-SECTION 0066In discussing the content of the advance care plan with your healthcare team, it is vital you explorethe medical management of care of symptomswhen the conventional intervention is not desired(e.g. invasive ventilation). In particular, when you choose not to have invasive breathing support, it isadvisable to have a plan for managing feelings ofbreathlessness, and for the rare instance of acutebreathing distress. Faced with the dilemma of acutebreathing distress and with a plan indicating no lifesustaining interventions, it may be reasonable to accepttemporary non-invasive breathing support (e.g., bi-levelventilator) to control symptoms. Both invasive andnoninvasive ventilation can be withdrawn at any time,and the medical team can ensure that this is done com-fortably. It is legally and morally acceptable in Canadato ask to have life-sustaining therapies includingmechanical ventilation and a feeding tube withdrawn.However, you may wish to speak with your spiritualadvisor, as there are some religions where withdrawalof mechanical ventilation is not acceptable. Choices About Where to die Many people with ALS prefer to die in the peace oftheir own home. Others may prefer to be in a facilityof some kind. Whichever is your wish, you must com-municate this to your family and healthcare team whileyou are still able to do so. Factors that might not makedying at home possible include your family's financialor emotional inability to cope, caregiver burnout, respi-ratory problems or insufficient home care services.Remember, calling 911 will bring a medical team obli-gated to keep you alive, including artificial life supportthat you may not want. Some provinces may have adeath at home policy which allows you to by-pass call-ing 911. There will be forms to complete. Please checkwith your local ALS Clinic or Society. If you choose to die at home, you may consider some specifics such as: Which room do you want to be in? Is there a favourite view you want to be positioned toward? Choices About Who and What You Want Around You To take the guess work out of deciding who is appro-priate to visit with you during your last days or hours,tell your caregivers ahead of time. A few of the questions you need to ask yourself and answer include: Are there people you want to re-connect with now ? Whom do you want near you in your final days? Is there something special you want them to do foryou, like read your favourite book aloud? Do you want your pet at your side? Some people are very specific about how theywant the environment around them to be. It is a good idea for you to contemplate the kind of settingyou think would put you at ease. Communicating thisto caregivers and other loved ones will enable them tomake sure you have the setting you want. It will alsomake them feel good about being able to help you feelat peace and \"do something\" constructive. Some of the questions you may ask yourself include: Do you want music playing and if so what kind? Do you want to be near an open window so you can feel a breeze? Would you like candles with a favourite scent burn-ing? Are there important pictures of places you've been,or family gatherings that you want in your view? There are many decisions you can choose to make.Give as much thought as you can and involve others tohelp you sort through it all. There are some excel- lent resource books and videos available to sup-port you. Many are listed in the \"Resource Section\" of the Manual.

One such resource is the booklet, Coping With Grief,published by the ALS Society of Canada which is available through the ALS Society in your province.This booklet also touches on anticipatory grief which is experienced before death by both the person who isgoing to die and their loved ones. This type of grief isof course unique to those affected by long-term ill-nesses. During the course of the illness there is griev-ing around losses of function, roles, and hope.Triggers of anticipatory grief could be a terminal diag-nosis, decreasing control over daily activities, loss offunction, changes in roles, and lost hopes and dreamsfor the future. Psychosocial support during the grieving process can help individuals process and express their feelings inhealthy ways that will eventually help bring about heal-ing. Sources of support in the community includehospice organizations, members of the clergy, andmental health practitioners such as therapists who specialize in grief counselling. Another great source ispeer support from others who have gone through the same experience. Your local ALS Society may be ableto match bereaved caregivers with former ALS care-givers who either meet as a group or are willing to helpothers one-on-one. Have you ever thought about how you want to be remembered, or what you want to leave behind to helpcomfort your loved ones? Telling one's life story and documenting memories on paper, video, oraudio tape can be an excellent way to help transi-tion to the final stage of life and leave one's markon the world. The process can be very therapeutic in terms of searching for the meaning of one's life andidentifying core values and beliefs. Sharing it will pass on valuable lessons to others. Looking back and sharing special memories can be both a fun and enriching experience for yourself as wells as loved ones engaged in the process. Family and friends will likely be able to trigger memories of things you may have forgotten, or buried and vice versa. Leaving a legacy may spark feelings of satisfaction of a life well-lived as well as give survivors a tangible mem-ory of who you are, what you believed, and how you lived your life to inspire future generations.

Therefore, consider carefully what your longer term needs are likely to be before applying for this type of assistance program. Check with the ALS Society for Equipment Some ALS Units and Chapters in your area may have a limited or extensive inventory of equipment acquired through the generosity of contributors and for use by people with ALS. See the information provided by your provincial ALS Society for more specifics. Identify Local Equipment Suppliers Most suppliers of equipment for people with disabili- ties are listed in the phone book under \"Hospital Equipment and Supplies.\" Get Advice from Home Care Home care staff is another source of information about assistive equipment. Many of them have proba- bly visited other people with similar needs, and have seen how useful different types of equipment have been. Assistive Tools for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Many people with ALS develop trouble with grasping and manipulating objects. It is often possible to modi- fy everyday tools or to substitute specially designed versions of such tools to compensate for weakness in the muscles of the fingers, hands and wrists. For example, thick handle, lightweight untensils can make eating much easier for those with a weak grasp. There are also sets of cutlery available with thick, long handles that compensate to some extent for impaired shoulder movement. Mugs with oversized handles will allow you to slip all fingers under the handle, reducing the danger of spills. A plate guard gives a slightly raised edge to a plate so that food can be pushed against it onto a spoon or fork. Common devices such as electric toothbrushes and shavers can make these tasks easier when arms are weak. ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.0068ASSISTIVE EQUIPMENT SECTION 5A Manual for People Living with ALSAssistive equipment plays a major role in the lives of persons with ALS. Because ALS is a progressive condition, physical changes occur over time requiring the on-going need for assistive devices to maintain function. ALS will affect each individual somewhat differently. For you, a wheelchair may not be necessary. For someone else, specialized communication devices may never be required. This section attempts to give you an overview of the many types of equipment that may be needed by someone with ALS. not everyone will need all of it and certainly not all at once. Before purchasing assistive equipment or modifying your home, you are advised to consult with profes- sionals who are familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of the equipment that is available to serve your needs. Equipment can be expensive, so you need to make wise choices. Think through what your needs are, both in the imme- diate and longer term. Discuss your needs with a doc- tor, nurse, physiotherapist, occupational therapist or other healthcare professional with knowledge of yourcondition, and familiarity with the available equipment to serve those needs. Make sure to check your own private or group insurance plan to determine what coverage you have and what documentation you require for coverage. Some plans may only cover cer- tain items every so many years. Find out from your healthcare professionals, what loan equipment or financial assistance might be available. Your provincial ALS Society is also an excellent source for helping you locate the kind of equipment you may need. In many cases, the Society will have the equip- ment you need through their equipment loan program. You may also want to visit local suppliers to test out various equipment options. Check Into financial Support Programs Check with your local healthcare professional and equipment suppliers to find out what government sup- port programs are available in your area for equipment, and for home renovations required to accommodateBEFORE PURCHASING EQUIPMENT TYPES OF EQUIPMENT 2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 86The double action of gripping and turning a doorknob may also be a problem for you. Changing to a lever style handle could be the answer since it allows the door to be opened by pushing down or pulling up thelever. A broad wooden or plastic handle attached toyour door key can help with the turning motion neces-sary to turn the key in the lock. To assist with written communication, use thick pens or pencils that are easier to grasp, Pen/pencil grips can be found at school supply stores. Gel pens that glide easier on paper may also help. Your health pro-fessional can show you different writing aids that mini-mize the amount of pinch or grip required to hold apen or pencil. Clothing fasteners can be difficult to use if your hands and fingers are weak. There are devices to assist in fas-tening buttons, such as zipper pulls and button hooks.Velcrois a popular replacement for buttons, zippersm and laces. Elastic shoe laces can turn lace up shoes intoslip-ons. Such items as pants or skirts with elastic waistbands need no fasteners at all. Although pullover tops have no closures, they can be some ofthe hardest clothes to get on and off. Ensure pulloversare loose and stretchy. Your occupational therapist canshow you tips to make dressing easier. Electronic devices known as \"environmental aids to daily living (EAdLs),\" can be installed in the hometo enable a person with ALS to control lights, radios,televisions, open and close doors, start a coffee maker,etc. with the palm of the hand, a head movement, oreven a puff of breath. Hands-free speaker phones canbe used with voice commands or the touch of aswitch. We have mentioned just a few of the modified or special tools available to make everyday life easier for you. There are many more such tools that youroccupational therapist can tell you about. It is important to discuss any tool with your therapistbefore making a purchase. Some devices are reasonably priced and some are expensive. Some will assist you fora long period of time, whereas others may only be use-ful in the short-term. Your therapist can save you dis-appointments as well as costly errors.Body Supports The various types of body supports available are called orthoses. Available through hospitals and clinics,orthoses help to support your joints in certain posi-tions when your muscles weaken, prevent contractures,enhance comfort, and aid in function. Orthoses aretypically prescribed by a physiatrist , and may be rec- ommended by your doctor or physiotherapist or occu-pational therapist.. There are more orthoses available than we can discuss in this brief overview, but some of the major ones aredescribed. foot and Ankle Supports Many people with ALS experience \"foot drop\" whichis caused by weakened muscles supporting the anklejoint. This leads to stumbling on stairs or curbs andtripping while walking. The answer may be a simpleankle-foot splint made of plastic that is inconspicuousunder trousers or slacks. These devices are oftenreferred to as \"ankle and foot orthoses\" (AfOs). Hand and Wrist Supports A wrist and thumb splint can stabilize the wrist andthumb, helping you to grasp objects. Additional sup-ports can be added for positioning the fingers toenchance your function despite weakened fingers. The universal cuff may be the most familiar orthotic aid. This straps over the hand and allows you to grasp such objects as cutlery, hairbrushes and other smallpersonal objects. A thumb splint helps in squeezing thefingers in opposition to the fingers and makes it easierto grasp and hold an object for use. Shoulder and neck Supports Weakened shoulder muscles can cause the arms to\"hang\" more than normal, which can become verypainful. A shoulder sling can pull the arm up, reducingthe pressure on arm muscles and ligaments. There arealso cervical collars that can support the head whenneck muscles are weak. ALS.

FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSASSISTIVE EQUIPMENT SECTION 5 00692012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 87Manual Wheelchairs Lightweight manual wheelchairs are often used by peo- ple who retain trunk stability and the ability to self- position themselves in the chair. Supportive seat and backrests can be added for comfort and support. They have large wheels that can be propelled by the user and push handles at the back if assistance is needed. These chairs are light to push and may be transported by car. Because ALS is a degenerative disease, it may be more cost-effective to rent or borrow this type of chair from your provincial ALS Society equipment pool, leaving funds available for other equipment. Manual Positioning Wheelchairs Manual wheelchairs with dynamic positioning features, for example that tilt back, can be used for people with limited ability to weight shift or reposition. In most cases assistance is required to move and tilt the wheel- chair. Specialized seating can be added to optimize postural support, comfort and pressure relief. Power Scooters Power scooters can be used by people who have limit- ed walking but can transfer independently and have adequate arm strength to operate the controls. They provide basic seating and postural support and are gen- erally suitable for community mobility only. Therefore cost and length of use are important considerations. Power Wheelchairs For the more advanced stages of ALS, a battery-pow- ered wheelchair may be required. These can be operat- ed using a joystick or other switching devices that can be controlled by almost any part of the body that you can move. Control switches can be modified to oper- ate with even very small muscle movements. Power wheelchairs allow a person to remain mobile and independent throughout the more advanced stages of ALS in their home and com- munity. However, not all power wheelchairs are created equally! It is essential that modification and customization in seat and back supports, positioning features, electronics, and controls are possible for com- plex and changing needs. Specialized seat cushions and back supports can be ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.0070ASSISTIVE EQUIPMENT SECTION 5A Manual for People Living with ALSWalking Equipment Aids Canes and Walkers Most people with ALS will require a cane or walker at some point. These are especially useful when one leg is stronger than the other. Canes should always be used on the stronger side, with the cane moving forward with the weaker leg. There are single or multi-leggedcanes, so discuss with your therapist which type of aid might work best for you. Another type of cane, or forearm crutch extends up the lower arm, almost to the elbow, with a ring that fits around the arm for added support. Walkers provide maximum support andstability because they spread the weight over a wide area. The choice of cane or walker should be made in consultation with your doctor, occupa- tional therapist, or physiotherapist. You should not try to use it until you have received instruction from your therapist. Wheelchairs Getting fitted with a wheelchair requires careful con- sideration and professional advice. First, your size will determine the appropriate height, depth and width ofseat, as well as the height and width of the back. An occupational therapist can help you get the right chair for you. It is very important that you get the right chair. Many factors will have to be considered, such as your physical condition now and in the future, your financial situation, insurance coverage, the availability of finan- cial assistance, your level of help from family andfriends, and the sorts of services your community pro- vides for transportation. A wheelchair is a major pur- chase, and if it is going to enhance your life now and in the future, it must be a careful choice. Transport Wheelchairs Transport wheelchairs are helpful for people who require assistance or cannot walk long distances. They are very basic, provide minimal postural support, and require assistance to push. However, they are inexpen- sive, very portable, can be easily transported in a car or airplane. 2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 88ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.A Manual for People Living with ALSASSISTIVE EQUIPMENT SECTION 5 0071added to optimize postural support, comfort and pres- sure relief. Power dynamic positioning features like tilt, allow independent repositioning for weight shift and pressure relief to prevent pressure sores and postural changes to optimize respiration and comfort. Some power wheelchairs have capabilities to control other devices like your TV or computer, for example. If hand and arm function are limited and you can no longer operate the joystick, other options like head controls or switches that are operated by other parts ofthe body, are possible. Due to the complexity, these types of wheelchairs are very expensive and financial resources like insurance coverage, not-for-profit organizations and provincial programs should be considered. It is therefore impera- tive that a power wheelchair be assessed, trialed andprescribed by an occupational therapist with expertise in these types of wheelchairs. Lifts and Stair Glides This type of equipment is used to address home acces- sibility problems or to make it safer and easier for you to transfer from one surface to another. It can be expensive and requires much consideration and pre- planning to determine what is the best solution for your home-setting and longer-term situation. The types of lifting equipment to consider include lift chairs, stair glides, portable lifts, ceiling-track lifts andwheelchair lifts. It is best to get an occupational therapist to assess your residence and situation when making your plans regarding lifting devices. Lift Chair People with weakened legs will find it difficult to get up out of chairs. Higher chairs with arms to push up can make it easier. Ideally, a motorized lift chair can be used to safely raise a person from a seated to a stand. In addition, lift chairs also recline to optimize sitting posture and comfort and to allow gravity assist- ed positioning for people with a weak neck and/or back. Some models come with heaters, a massage device and other features that may be beneficial. Ceiling Lifts Ceiling lifts are usually installed to move a personbetween the bedroom, bathroom and living areas. In this case a rail is installed in the ceiling, and the per- son is lifted in a sling that attaches to the ceiling lift. There are also turntable tracks that allow the running tracks to intersect or cross. Installing a ceiling lift sys- tem is a major project that requires professional advice and installation. Portable floor Lifts Portable floor lifts also use a sling to lift a person up. They can be rolled around on one level of the home, but require sufficient floor space to manou-ver.A common type of floor lift is the Hoyer Lift. Some of these kinds of lifts are light, can be broken down into two pieces, and moved to a different level of the home, or put in a car. The minimum door size for moving a person through in a portable lift is about 26\". Using a ceiling or floor lift requires training, to ensure the safety of both you and your caregiver. Stair Glides Most stair glides use a track that is fastened securely to the wall side of a stairway. An automated chair can then be moved up and down the track. Stair glides can go on curving stairs, and even around corners, may not be a good long term solution, as safe sitting balance and ability to transfer on and off is required. Stair glides should only be installed by a professional familiar with the safety aspects of this equipment. Porch Lifts Porch lifts are often used when it is not practical to have a wheelchair ramp from an outside door to ground level. Again, installing a porch lift system is a major project which requires advice and installa- tion by a professional who is familiar with all safety aspects of installation and use. Bathroom Equipment There are several devices to help people with disabilities in the bathroom. Raised toilet seats or commode chairsare a standard requirement for those with weak- ened leg muscles. Raised seats can range from home- made and low-cost seats to more expensive models. Another option is to have a plumber raise the level of2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 89of AAC equipment for loan. Acquiring AAC equipment is only half of the equation. It is critical that you are properly assessed by anassistive technology expert, who may be a speechlanguage pathologist or occupational therapist andtrained how to use the devices. It is important for your family caregivers to also be trained. Tube Feeding Equipment Tube feeding normally requires two pieces of equip- ment: 1.Container with a tube and clamp for the liquid food 2.Poleto hang the container on A pump may also be used instead of a clamp to regulate the liquid flow for a short period (2 to 4 weeks) while you get used to tube feeding. A specialsyringe can also be used to inject liquid through a tube,or to check if your stomach has too much liquid. Containers Feed containers come in the form of plastic bags orbottles with a tube attached. Some containers have astretchable section, which is required if a pump is beingused. These containers need to be thoroughly cleanedevery day and replaced with a new container approxi-mately every seven days. When choosing a container you will consider various factors: format:A plastic bag or plastic bottle Capacity: Common sizes range from 500 to 1000 ml Tube:You may need the type of tube that works with a pump Poles It may be practical to rig up your own method for hanging the feeding container. One way is to use a poleheld up by a Christmas tree stand. If you wish to pur-chase a pole, the commonly available models are pricedfrom under $100 to over $400. Most models are ALS.

Attachments to give a standard toilet a bidetfunction are also available. Some people with ALS who haveproblems with their arms and hands find using a bidetenables them to retain total independence with toileting. When it comes to bathing, there are a number of assis- tive devices. There are several models of bathtub seats and lifting equipment that can assist you in sliding or rotating over the tub for showering. Retail stores that handle equipment for the disabled often have a variety of bathroom aids on display. Checkwith your occupational therapist or other healthcareprofessional for their assistance in choosing the rightequipment for you. Beds and Mattresses A common problem during the advanced stages of ALS is being unable to roll over in bed. Lying in oneposition can become painful, or a caregiver is requiredto move you every few hours. Satin sheets and or pyjamas can make turning easier. There are also differ-ent mattresses and overlays of various materials likefoam, gel, and air which can optimize comfort andpressure relief. A bed with an incline feature can be helpful with breathing and comfort. Devices from foam wedges to fully automatic hospital beds are used. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Equipment There are many different types of assistive devices available to help communicate if speech is impaired.These devices range from alphabet and messageboards, to speaking valves for those on a respirator, to small hand held electronic speaking devices , to computer based systems with sophisticated soft- ware and speech synthesizers. Your choice will depend on your specific needs, available resources andyour adaptability to new ways of communicating. Keep in mind that assistive technology is continually improving. A representative from your local ALSSociety should be able to help you identify equipmentresources in your community and may have some typesSee Section 4, Sub-section Adapting to Changes in Speech and Maintaining Communication.2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 90ALS.

When choosing an IV pole, you should consider the following options: More expensive models tend to be more sturdy and stable floor models or other models that attach to a table, chair or a bed Wheelchair model can attach to your wheelchair allowing you to bring it wherever you need to go Pocket model available for travelling. It has fittings that will attach to a variety of surfaces, including asuction cup for windows, a magnet for metal surfaces,an eye and two hooks, one of which is for the food container. Listed below are some considerations to keep in mind when making home modifications to accommodatewheelchair users: Rearrange furniture to make wheelchair access and movement easier Install ramps (12:1 slope equals 12 inches length for every one inch height) and guardrails doorways should be at least 76 cm (30 in.) wide. They can be widened by removing the door andhinges, or removing inner moldings and installing asliding door or curtain. Hallways should be 92 cm (36 in.) wide to accom- modate the chair's turning radius. A cleared turningspace of 1.6m2 (five sq. ft.) is necessary for safe andeasy turns Space under sinks and counters to accommodate wheelchairs can be made by removing cupboards. Exposed pipes must be insulated Thick carpets can hinder the movement of a wheelchair; Berber carpet, wood, laminate, or linoleum are good choices for wheelchair users Shower renovations should be completely barrierfree with no step for wheelchair access Some families will choose to make extensive homemodifications while others will not. The financial cost is a major consideration. However, it is impor- tant to note that while it may seem like a good idea tomake modifications well in advance of needing them,given your expectations of the disease process, keep inmind ALS is very individual. Your disease mayprogress slowly and spending money on a roll-in show-er now, may not be something you need for severalyears if ever. The more expensive the modification,the more consultation you will need with your occupa-tional therapist. It is also a good idea to talk to other families who have been affected by ALS toshare their thoughts, opinions, and experiences. In recent years, service dogs have become an assistance option (and companion) for people with ALS. Theycan be taught various tasks, such as carrying or fetch-ing objects and opening doors. They can be trained topull a wheelchair or brace a person so they can inde-pendently transfer from one seat to another. Servicedogs can also be trained to bark for help, alert a familymember or caregiver in the event of an emergency andlie down on its partner's chest to produce a cough.Several organizations across Canada train service dogsfor people with ALS. Contact your Provincial ALSSociety for a list of trainers. Final Note on Assistive Equipment... The most important messages to remember when it comes to assistive equipment are to: Think about both short- and long-term needs Consult with appropriate healthcare professionalsabout your equipment options and how to use whatyou select Learn from others who have come up with creative,simple solutions Seek information on financial assistance and equip-ment loan programs to minimize your out of pocketexpensesHOME MODIFICATIONSSERVICE DOGSSee Section 4, Sub-section Adapting to Swallowing Problems and Maintaining Good Nutrition.2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 91would be compromised if you told your employer? In Canada it is a legal requirement to \"accommodate\" a person with a disability such as ALS. If you have questions about this policy please contact your ALSteam social worker or consult an attorney specializing inemployment law. Factors to consider before leaving work: Do you have access to benefits? Private Pension, Extended Health Care, Short Term Disability, Long Term Disability, Banked Sick Time, Medical EI, CanadaPension Plan etc? Does working bring meaning and quality to your life that would be missing if you were unable to continueworking? Have you made modifications, but are still unable to carry out your job duties? Do you have the energy to continue working? What financial supports do you have? (RRSPs, Savings, Investments, etc.) It is highly recommended that you do not sign any- thing regarding your termination without first gettinglegal advice. You may be eligible for serance packagesand benefits. Should you have any questions about what goverment programs and benefits you may be eligible for, pleasecontact your social worker. What Protections Do You Have Under Provincial Labour Legislation? The legislation for each province varies with respect to employee rights. Consider getting advice from a lawyerwho specializes in human rights, provincial employ-ment standards and labour legislation. Many provinceshave free or subsidized legal support available to resi-dents. Consult with your ALS Clinic social workerwho may be able to answer some questions around rel-evant legislation and provide information on localresources.

FOREVER.0074FINANCIAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS SECTION 6A Manual for People Living with ALSHaving diagnosis of ALS may result inincreased expenses. This may be true,whether one remains at home, or if one resides in a Long Term Care Facility. Caregiving sup-port, equipment, medical supplies and medications forsymptom management are just some of the costs asso-ciated with a diagnosis of ALS. These additionalexpenses may not be covered by provincial programs,extended health benefits or non-profit organizationsand therefore become the responsibility of the clientand their family. In some provinces, there are supportand funding resources available to assist with thesenew expenses. It is important to check with the localALS Society and healthcare team around what sup-ports are offered and how to access them. The assis- tance provided by the ALS Society becomes, formany people, a critical factor maintaining qualityof life. For those who have been diagnosed with ALS and continue to work, one of the things to consider iswhen and what to tell your employer. This is a personaldecision depending on your and your employment situ-ation. In light of a diagnosis of ALS, you may wish to con- sider exploring any extended healthcare benefitsyou might be eligible for. It is important to consider yourcurrent needs in addition to what may be required inthe future, as there may be limits to what is provided.Consultation with your healthcare team is recommend-ed while investigating these resources. All of this can be done before telling your employer you have ALS. When Do You Tell Your Employer? Here are some factors to consider before notifying your employer: Are you working on a project that you want to finish, before telling your employer?

You should also note whothe subscriber is (you or your spouse), his/her date ofbirth, and social insurance number. Identify any otherinsurance benefits you may have, such as a separateprescription benefit card or a long-term-care policy. If you have more than one insurance plan, deter- mine which policy is primary and which is sec-ondary; confusion with this matter can result inbilling errors. Your insurance company customer service representative can be helpful in identifyingwhich plan is to be billed first. Also keep up to dateon your insurance; if your coverage changes in anyway, notify all your doctors, medical suppliers, andpharmacists immediately so that the next time youaccess their services, you will have helped to preventbilling errors. Contact your insurance company directly, and ask specific questions about your benefits. Always note the date and the person providing the information.Remember, having your benefits described over thephone does not guarantee coverage. Your doctor maybe asked to write a letter of medical necessity andcomplete specific forms to verify your medical condi-tion and eligibility for whatever item or service is beingrequested. Ask if your policy offers case management. Case managers either work for the insurance company or are contracted by them to monitor and advocate for clientswhose costs are high or who have complicated needs.They are often helpful in gaining access to little-knowninsurance benefits, and reducing your overall out-of-pocket expenses. Case management can be activated atvarious stages of your illness, depending on how yourinsurance company has defined the benefit. Having direct communication with your insurance carrier willhelp you to gain an overview of your policy and remove the mystery of how your plan works. Below is a guide that may be helpful when contacting your insurance company. It is advised that you have allof the specific information about your insurance plan in front of you while calling. Feel free to ask what cer- tain words or terms mean.Group insurance can be valuable resource. If youhave group insurance through your employer, youmay need to seek advice from a lawyer union rep-resentative, or someone else you can trust toensure that this insurance coverage continues tobe effective when you are. Should you experience difficulties around coverage, you may wish to consultan attorney about your right. Driving and Property Insurance Driving can sometimes require fast foot and hand reac- tions. Speak with your doctor about whether you aresafe to continue driving. A driving test may be requiredto verify your current abilities. Please speak with yourlocal health care provider about how to access theseservices. Also, note that the legislation pertaining todriving safety varies from province to province.Should you have any questions about this, pleas e con-tact your local motor vehicles department. If you have specialized equipment, have made modifi- cations or renovations to your home, as the result ofyour diagnosis, you may need additional property insur-ance. Review your current plan and speak with aninsurance representative to ensure coverage or if youhave any questions. Life Insurance: Living Benefits Some life insurance companies offer a \"living ben- efit\" feature to people with a terminal diseaseenabling them to recieve a portion of their lifeinsurance paid to them in advance, during theyears before their death. What should I do if I am interested in getting living benefits? Before you decide to apply for living benefits, talk to a lawyer or accountant about all the financial impli- cations.At the present time, the federal government is not taxing living benefits, but anyone receiving a lump-sum living benefit payment will no longer be eligiblefor social assistance benefits.

Group Pension Plans If you are in a company or other group pension plan, find out about any changes to your plan as aresult of an ALS diagnosis. To ensure that you get your full entitlement, have these questions answered bysomeone you trust. Can you receive some of your pension before age 65, if you are disabled, and unable to work? Will payments be made to your spouse if you are no longer alive? If problems occur, you may need advice from a lawyer with experience with group pension plans. To minimize tax on death, you may want to make sure that your spouse is the beneficiary of yourpension plan; otherwise your pension plan's value willbe part of your estate, and subject to probate fees. Persons with ALS may qualify for a CPP disability pen- sion. To be eligible for a Canada Pension PlanDisability Pension, you must: Be under 65 years of age Stopped working because of your medical condition Made enough contributions in four of the last six years you were employed. Or Have paid into CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last sixyears. What if I am already retired and receivingCPP?

PENSION PLANS 2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 96Effective in 2006, the definition of family member was expanded to include those who provide care for a brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, in-law, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, foster parent, ward, guardian, or a gravely ill person, such as a neighbour or close friend, who considers the claimant to be like a family member. Benefits remain available to those caring for a parent, child, spouse or common-law partner. Note that com- mon-law partner means a person who has been living in a conjugal relationship with that person for at least one year. Compassionate care benefits can be paid even if the ill family member does not live in Canada. For additional information visit www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/ei/types/com - passionate_care.shtml. There may be a number of ways to more effectively manage your tax situation resulting in greater after-tax income. Talk to your accountant and/or financial advi- sor about your options. Disability Tax Credit The disability Tax Credit is a non refundable credit for eligible individuals or their representa- tives. It reduces income tax payable on your income tax return. Eligibility requirements are outlined on the application (T2201) which is available on the Revenue Canada website. The application must be completed and signed by your doctor. It is advised that you send your application in prior to tax season to avoid delays. Application processing times vary. Please keep a copy for your records. Other Tax Credits: Caregiver Tax Credit Attendant Care Expense Deduction Fuel Rebate (provincial and federal) Medical Expense Tax Credit You may also be eligible to claim certain medical expenses. Information on eligibility for tax programs can be found on the Revenue Canada website: http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/disability/. Your financial advisor, accountant, or social worker can assist you ALS.

Like most pen- sions, your CPP Disability Pension is considered tax- able, subject to your total income. Compassionate Care Benefits for Caregivers Eligible Canadian workers who take time off work to care for a gravely ill family member can receive up to six weeks of employment insurance benefits over aperiod of six months and will have their jobs protected. To qualify for compassionate care employment insur- ance benefits, applicants must have worked 600 hours in the previous 52 weeks and show that regular weekly earnings have decreased by 40%. They must also pro- vide a medical certificate to show that the family member has a high risk of death within 26 weeks. Compassionate care includes providing emotional support, arranging for third-party support or directlyproviding the care. Benefits may be shared among eligible family members. Things that Can Change Eligibility for a CPP Disability Pension: Those receiving a CPP Disability Pension must noti- fy the Canada Pension Plan of any changes that might affect their continuing eligibility for benefits. This includes: An improvement in your medical condition A return to full, part-time, volunteer or trial period of work Attendance at school or university; trade or techni- cal training Any vocational rehabilitationTAx ISSUES 2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 97ALS.

Minimize Tax Through Income Splitting Income splitting reduces a family's total income taxby dividing income among various family mem- bers, using the low tax rates of family members whohave little other income to offset the higher tax rates ofthose with higher income. This has to be done in waysthat will \"attribute\" less income to the higher incomeearner(s) in the family, according to CRA, such as thefollowing: Estate freezing Transfer property at fair market value Lend or gift assets to generate business income, or income on income Gift funds to child turning 17 Earn capital gains for children Reasonable salaries (for example, person with ALSpaying spouse as a caregiver is a deductible expenseto the person with ALS) High taxpayer pays all household expenses Deposit child tax credits in child's bank account Contribute to spousal RRSP Assign one half of CPP benefits to spouse This list is not exclusive. If substantial funds areinvolved, or even if funds are minimal, see a profes-sional tax expert who specializes in disability issues. Tax on Deemed Disposition of Assets on Death At the date of death, the CRA requires one tax return for income earned to the date during the year and toaccount for the tax that is applicable on all of the increased values of the deceased person's propertiesand other assets. There are certain tax-free \"roll over\" provisions for property left to a spouse, or spousal trust. Also, dividend-paying shares may incur a doubletax unless appropriate action is taken. Be sure to seek advice from a professional accountant on thesematters. Probate FeesA Certificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee with a Will validates a will. Upon issuing this certifi-cate, the Estate Court charges a tax rate that variesfrom province to province. Probate fees are decreasedby reducing the amount of the estate, such as makinglife insurance payable to a spouse instead of to theestate. U.S. Estate TaxIf you were born in the U.S. and own property in the U.S., or own U.S. securities registered in your name,your beneficiaries may be required to pay U.S. taxes onthe estate. Even if you have been a Canadian citizen for most of your life, when the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)learns of a person's death, they will apply an estate taxon the total estate, regardless of what countries theassets are in. Assets will then be held by the IRS untilthis tax is paid. There are easy ways to avoid this tax. Ifthis could happen to you, see a professional accountant who is familiar with U.S. estate taxes. Tax-Effective Wills There are numerous estate planning alternatives, including naming a spouse as beneficiary to all lifeinsurance and pension plans. Also multiple testamen-tary trusts, an exclusive spousal trust and trustee pow-ers to authorize actions to minimize tax are other tech-niques. Mentioning these plans in a will helps toensure that your plan will be carried out according toyour wishes. Bequests to a voluntary organization can also reduce estate tax. Again, if substantial amounts are involved, it is probably wise to consultwith a professional estate planning accountant or estateplanning lawyer. Review your Will and Powers of Attorney to ensure that these reflect your current wishes. Keep readingfor more information about living wills and powers ofattorney. Power of Attorney A Power of Attorney is a document that allows an adult to appoint an individual to make decisionsregarding their financial and legal affairs on theirbehalf. This \"attorney\" is authorized to act when theadult becomes incapable, due to limited mental abilityor illness. You may choose one or more persons to act FUTURE PLANNING DOCUMENTS2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 98for your representative to make decisions about your financial matters. Temporary Substitute Decision Making In some provinces, in the event you have not legally appointed an alternate health care decision maker and you require someone to make such decisions on your behalf, a Temporary Substitute Decision Maker (TSDM) will be appointed by your healthcare team. A Temporary Substitute Decision Maker is chosen from a predetermined list and must meet certain criteria. The TSDM is obligated to make decisions that are in line with your wishes. The legislation surrounding TSDM varies from province to province. If you are uncertain as to who your TSDM will be, please consult with your healthcare providers. Informing Your Alternate Decision Maker There are numerous ways in which you can inform your family, Power of Attorney for Health Care, Representative or TSDM. Below please find a summa- ry of each. A Living Will, or Advance Care Plan, is a docu- ment that outlines your beliefs, values and wishes regarding future healthcare treatment. A living will or advance care plan is used by your alternate decision maker and your healthcare team as a guide to understanding what your wishes around future interventions might be should you be unable to communicate them yourself. This is a general guide about your wishes and may not cover every possible outcome. That is okay. It will be up to your medical team and your alternate decision maker to determine the most appropriate course of action that is in line with your values and beliefs. This is why it is important to share your values and beliefs with your healthcare team and your alternate decision maker. Below are some things to consider when writing your living will or advance care plan: What makes my life meaningful? What and who do I care about in my life? How do I define quality in my life? What medical interventions would help maintain quality of my life? ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.0080FINANCIAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS SECTION 6A Manual for People Living with ALSas your power of attorney. If you select more thanone person, you must indicate whether any named individual can make decisions for you alone, orwhether they must make decisions as a group. Power of Attorney for Health Care In some provinces, a Power of Attorney document can be used to appoint an \"attorney\" who can make health care decisions your behalf should you be unable to. This is called a Power of Attorney for Health Care (PAHC). Your Power of Attorney for Health Care has the legal and ethical obligation to make decisions aboutyour health care that respect your wishes. Therefore, it is important to have open discussions around what those wishes might be. Representation Agreements In other provinces, alternate decision makers are appointed through what are known as Representation Agreements. Representation Agreements are legal doc-uments that appoint another individual to make health-care decisions on your behalf, should you be unable to.There are two parts to a Representation Agreement; each providing different powers. Section 7: Allows you to name an alternate decision maker who will have the authority to make decisions around routine management of your financial affairs, your personal care and some health care treatment. It does not allow for your representative to make health care treatment decisions that involve life sustaining or life ending interventions. Section 9: Allows you to appoint a representative to make decisions on your behalf around personal care and health care treatments; including decisions pertain- ing to life sustaining and life ending interventions. A Section 9 Representation Agreement does not allowThe Powers associated with a Power of Attorney vary from province to province. In some provinces, this document gives the \"attor- ney\" the authority to make decisions around your health care. Please check with your clinic social worker about relevant provincial legislation.

Or would I prefer a comfort care approach to end of life?Remember, an advance care plan or living will onlycomes into effect if you are unable to communicateyour wishes to your healthcare team. Once again, legislation in each province varies, asdoes terminology. If you have any questions about how or when a living will or advance care plan is used, or would like help creating one, please speak with your healthcare provider. Advance Care Directives In some provinces one can create a legally binding document that acts as direct communication to your doctor and healthcare team. These are sometimes known as Advanced Directives. These directives, out- lining your wishes, act as instructions to your health- care team. The directive only comes into effect if it relates to the current medical situation and you are unable to reliably communicate your wishes. The directive may take legal precedence over your alternate decision maker as it is considered direct communica- tion of your wishes. Why should I complete these documents? There are benefits to having these conversations andcompleting this documentation. For instance, these documents provide an opportunity for you to express your thoughts and wishes. They also help to reduce the stress your family and an alternate decision makermay experience in the event they have to make a deci- sion on your behalf. It is advised that you begin this process in the earlier stages of your disease when you are relatively healthy. Please share a copy of these documents with someone you trust and your healthcare providers. As a person with ALS, you will experience many changes in health and functional status, and as such, your perceived quality of life may also change. Therefore, what you decide you want today, may change a year from now. You may change your liv- ing will, advance care plan or advance directive at any time. It is advisable to revisit your planning documentation often to ensure that it accurately reflects your wishes. In the event you decide to change your plan please ensure that all pre-existingversions are destroyed. It is also important to notify those involved in your care of any changes to your plan and redistribute the revised plan accordingly. depending on which province you live in, you may need to consult with an attorney in order to create some of these documents. If you are unsure howto proceed, please contact your healthcare provider. Where Can I get Sample Advance directive documents? Advanced Care Planning documents are often available at no charge through your provincial government and can be downloaded on-line. A sample healthcare directive created specifically for palliative care patients, is available on-line at www.palliative.info, and an advance care directive form designed at the University of Washington specifically for patients with ALS (focusing on feeding tubes and invasive mechanical ventilation choices). This form is a figure contained in: Benditt, Smith, and Tonelli (2001). Issues and Opinions: Advance Care Planning in ALS. Muscle and Nerve, 24: 1706-1709. Contact your ALS Society office for a copy of this form. Estate planning is the process by which you begin to get your financial affairs in order. Estate plan- ning can include the creation of a Will, examination of assets and liabilities and the setting up of Trusts. Estate planning may reduce the amount of probate fees and taxes that your estate would otherwise pay. Estate Planning also gives you an opportunity to express your wishes for once you have passed away. Having an Estate Plan may anticipate different scenar- ios, but it is important to think about updating it whenever your financial or personal circumstances change. You may also want to change your Estate Plan if there is a change in the beneficiaries. An Estate Plan may also document what your wishes are for once you have passed away. This can include any spiritual or religious service you may wish to haveESTATE PLANNING2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 100ALS.

Having an Estate Plan provides guid- ance to your family during a time of great loss. Below please find some additional information oncreating a Will and some considerations for whenplanning your Estate. A Will is a legal document that provides instructions to your loved ones on how some of your assets and liabili-ties (i.e. property, investments, money) are distributedonce you have passed. A Will may minimize the addi-tional income taxes, and probate fees payable upon yourdeath. It may also minimize taxes payable by your benefi-ciaries on future income. A Will may not cover all assetsand investments. As a result, it is important to plan yourEstate in order to ensure that your wishes are met withminimal impact on your beneficiaries. Planning A WillTo plan a will you will need to: Make a list of all assets and liabilities including addi- tional taxes due on your death Determine who your beneficiaries will be, such as spouse, children, other relatives, friends, charities, etc. If you have minor children, appoint a Guardian in yourWill. Consider if you want to appoint a Guardian of theEstate. This guardian can receive funds from yourexecutor for the benefit of your children. The personyou choose may be the same guardian you choose foryour children or someone different. Consider tax reduction strategies, such as donations tocharities Choose your estate trustee, such as your spouse ortrusted friend. A lawyer, accountant or trust companycould be considered for more complex situations Making A Will\u2014Formal RequirementsA Will is only valid if it meets the requirements set out in the Wills legislation in the province or territory in which you live. Generally, the normalities include datingthe Will and having the maker of the Will (the \"Testator\") sign it in the presence of two witnesses, whoshould not be beneficiaries under the Will. The witnesses must also sign the document in the pres-enceof the Testator and each other. To avoid possible confusion in the future, only one copy of a Will should be signed. Many provinces alsoallow for the preparation of a \"holograph\" Will,which is a document that is completely in the hand-writing of the Testator and is dated and signed by theTestator. However, because of many drafting andother problems, holograph Wills are often a source ofconflict and litigation, so their use should bediscouraged. For similar reasons, the use of Will kits is not recom- mended. Given the broad range of legal areas andissues that must be considered inplanning and preparing a Will, some of which areoutlined here, there is really no substitute for the pro-fessional legal advice of a lawyerwhose practice is focussed on will, estate and taxplanning. You must also have the appropriate mental capacity to make a Will and must sign it willingly, withoutduress or improper influence by other individuals.Otherwise, the Will can be challenged and would beof no effect. For this reason, it is important to have aWill prepared while you are competent and capable,toensure that your intended beneficiaries will benefit asyou direct. It is also generally recommended that youreview your Will. Appointment of ExecutorsAn important advantage of making a Will is that it enables you to decide who will be the \"executor\"who will administer your estate.The executor of the estate plays an important role,since the executor is responsible for many tasks,which include collecting the assets of the estate, pay-ing taxes and any other liabilities, and distributing theassets according to theterms of the Will. Given the significance of an executor's duties and obligations, the selection of the executor should becarefully considered. When choosing an executor, youshould consider certain factors, including: LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 101Final Note on Financial and Legal Considerations On top of coping with the day-to-day challenges of liv- ing with a progressive illness like ALS, financial andlegal planning can seem overwhelming. However, it isvery important to consider these aspects of life foryourself as well as your loved ones. Perhaps asking afamily member or friend to help get you organized ordo research on your health benefits and legal rights can make it more manageable. ALS. Three letters that change people's lives. FOREVER.0083 FINANCIAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS SECTION 6A Manual for People Living with ALS The complexity of your assets and your estate How your estate is to be distributed. A Will leaving only outright gifts to intended beneficiaries will gener- ally be less complex to administer than an estateunder which trusts are to be established for one ormore beneficiaries The age of the proposed executor. It is generally preferable to name an executor who is younger thanyou, as this makes it more likely that yourexecutor will be available and able to act when andfor as long as requiredwhether a proposed executor has the necessary skillsand abilities to administer your estate effectively Where the proposed executor lives. Executors who do not reside in Canada have to post a bond as secu-rity before being allowed to administer an estate andcan create considerable complexity for the estate andfor the beneficiaries since they may also cause theestate to be non-resident for tax purposes The trustworthiness of the proposed executor.It is important to review your Will every few years to make sure that it continues to reflect yourwishes. If one does not have a Will, your assets and liabilities will be divided according to relevant legislation andthis may not happen the way you would have wanted.Should you have questions about how to preparean Estate Plan, please consult with a lawyer orestate planner. Using Your Will to Make That Special GiftMany people choose to make provision in their will to contribute a special bequest to a cause close to their heart. Bequests allow people to name a charity oftheir choice as a beneficiary and to make a financial contribution from their estate to the charity that is often far greater than would have been possible dur- ing their lifetime. family member or friend to help get you organized or do research on your health benefits and legal rights can make it more manageable. 2012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 1022012 Manual People Living With ALS --- English_as.e$S_Layout 1 12-06-27 1:51 PM Page 103ALS Management Guides and Coping with Chronic Illness Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis By Robert G.
