Do you feel like you have a rapid heartbeat, or shortness of breath? Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, known as PoTS syndrome, or POTS, is a condition that causes unstable blood pressure when changing positions. Acupuncture and TCM can help relieve dizziness and other symptoms of POTS. [Postural tachycardia syndrome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1050173821001225) (or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) is a chronic disorder related to the autonomic nervous system that causes people to experience [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [increased heart rate](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) when they move into an upright position; this is known as orthostatic intolerance. [POTS syndrome](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots#:~:text=Postural%20orthostatic%20tachycardia%20syndrome%20(POTS,from%20a%20lying%20down%20position.) is fairly common, affecting up to 3 million people in the U.S. POTS occurs more often in people assigned female at birth, and often first shows up during the teenage years. The most common [symptom of POTS](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots#:~:text=The%20symptoms%20of%20POTS%20include,%2C%20palpitations%2C%20tremor%20and%20nausea.) is feeling light-headed when changing your position from sitting to standing, or when getting up from lying down. Whenever we have been sitting or lying down for a while, blood pools in the lower parts of the body. When we get up, the autonomic nervous system starts a series of actions to move blood back up into the top half of the body. This involves squeezing blood vessels, and releasing adrenaline and norepinephrine, to make the heart beat faster. When a person has POTS, more blood tends to pool in the legs, and the nervous system process doesn't cause the normal, quick response from the blood vessels, so more hormones are released, which can cause the person's heart rate to increase, and a [dizzy, faint feeling](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/pots-lightheadedness-and-a-racing-heart-202110012608#:~:text=However%2C%20for%20others%2C%20a%20vicious,of%20circulating%20blood%20is%20reduced.). Medical science has not yet discovered exactly what causes POTS, but there are different characteristics that allow for categorizing these different types of POTS syndrome: - Neuropathic POTS - damage to small fiber nerves that control blood vessel constriction in the abdomen and limbs - Hyperadrenergic POTS - when a person has elevated levels of norepinephrine - Hypovolemic POTS - when a person has unusually low blood levels - Secondary POTS - when POTS symptoms are related to another condition that causes neuropathy, such as [Lyme disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lyme-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or autoimmune disorders like [Lupus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lupus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or [celiac disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-celiac-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). While POTS is not rare, it can be difficult to get a diagnosis, because the criteria can be vague, and the symptoms can so often be related to other conditions, or just seem \"normal.\" For many people, POTS is truly debilitating and can have a serious, negative impact on daily life. It can also contribute to feelings of anxiety and depression. Acupuncture and TCM offer an adjunct or alternative treatment for POTS that can help with dizziness, irregular heartbeat, digestive problems, muscle weakness, migraines, trouble sleeping, and other symptoms, all at the same time. Top 10 POTS Symptoms The primary symptoms of POTS are related to the cardiovascular system: rapid heartbeat, and dizziness. However, there can be many other [POTS symptoms](https://www.healthline.com/health/pots-syndrome-symptoms#symptoms). - Irregular heart rate, rapid heart rate, fast heartbeat, chest pain, heart palpitations - Dizziness, especially when standing up or getting up from lying down, feeling faint - Breathing problems: hyperventilating, bronchial asthma, shortness of breath [Constipation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-constipation-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), nausea, abdominal pain - Muscle weakness, muscle pain, tremor - Skin rash, flushed face, flushing, sweating [Migraine headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - Cognitive issues, brain fog, difficulty concentrating - Trouble sleeping - Frequent urination, nocturia Other symptoms of POTS may include: [tinnitus (ringing in the ears)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/), blurred vision, red or purple appearance of the legs when standing up, and a \"jittery\" feeling or general nervousness. As with many syndromes, different people will experience different combinations of symptoms. While dizziness and rapid heartbeat are the signs most commonly associated with POTS, many people with POTS will also suffer from abdominal pain and gastrointestinal problems, perhaps without realizing there is a correlation. POTS symptoms [may resemble](https://www.sjogrensadvocate.com/post/part-1-pots-and-its-mimics) many other conditions, such as: [Chronic fatigue syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), ME/CFS [Graves disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-graves-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) involve tachycardia [Anemia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anemia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Epilepsy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Adrenal fatigue - Drug use - Eating disorders [Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Because POTS is often misunderstood or misdiagnosed, many patients will be offered medications to manage headaches, vertigo, or [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), which may not offer much relief. Medical Treatment for POTS As there is no definitive cure for POTS, [Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16560-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots) treatments typically aim to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Dietary modifications are a fundamental component of POTS management. Adequate daily fluid intake is crucial. A diet that includes plenty of salt helps maintain blood volume, aiding blood flow to vital organs. Patients are typically advised to avoid alcohol and carefully monitor caffeine intake, as these substances can exacerbate symptoms. Exercise is gradually introduced, often starting in reclined or horizontal positions, with the goal of increasing exercise tolerance over time. Physical therapy helps retrain the autonomic nervous system, enhancing blood circulation. Compression garments can help reduce blood pooling, and specific postures while sitting or sleeping may alleviate symptoms. Identifying triggers such as prolonged sitting, heat, or certain drugs allows for better symptom control. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and pulse, along with adequate sleep hygiene, aids overall well-being. While no single pharmacological solution is universally effective, some medications may be prescribed based on individual symptoms. These may help to improve blood volume, aid sodium retention, reduce heart rate, and enhance blood vessel constriction. While POTS symptoms may intermittently improve with medications and lifestyle modifications, the underlying cause of POTS may persist. Acupuncture and TCM treatment can provide a holistic solution for individuals living with POTS, which may help to address the root causes of this syndrome. Can Acupuncture Help POTS? POTS is a kind of Dysautonomia; this is a general term that describes conditions that involve malfunctioning of the autonomic nervous system. This causes people's bodies to have problems with regulating the sorts of functions that are typically automatic, like the beating of the heart, circulation of blood, breathing, and temperature control. Western medicine offers some treatments that can help address individual symptoms of dysautonomia, but it does not have a way of treating the root of the problem. It can be difficult to get proper treatment, because people who suffer from POTS and other kinds of dysautonomia often seem reasonably healthy, and their complaints\u2014dizziness, headaches, mental health problems\u2014seem vague. Acupuncture and TCM have been used to treat these kinds of problems for centuries. [Acupuncture treatment](https://acupuncturetoday.com/article/33268-dysautonomia-the-medical-condition-you-may-already-be-treating) can help provide positive effects on the subtle communications of the nervous system, as well as the [heart rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK196324/), and physiological symptoms of anxiety. According to TCM theory, several organ systems may be involved and need support: not only the heart, but also the kidneys or spleen. [Studies](https://www.omicsonline.org/proceedings/dysautonomia-relief-by-acupressure-59444.html#:~:text=Worthy%20of%20note%2C%20there%20is,viable%20choice%20for%20treating%20dysautonomia.) have shown that acupuncture for dysautonomia can help relieve symptoms like heart palpitations, insomnia, and digestive problems. A qualified acupuncturist is also well-versed in nutrition and can offer more detailed information regarding dietary and lifestyle changes that can help each individual patient. Your TCM provider will spend time learning more about you, so that they can offer personalized advice. Acupuncture Near Me for POTS in West Los Angeles TCM and acupuncture can help people with all types of autoimmune disorders, nerve disorders, and conditions involving fatigue and dizziness that may be difficult to solve with conventional methods. Acupuncture works on a deeper, more subtle level to help address complex syndromes. If you are regularly experiencing trouble with feeling light-headed, having unexplained headaches and sleep problems, it may be time to seek a more holistic alternative treatment. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Therefore acupuncture and Chinese herbs are often not supported by double-blind, randomized trials, and they are considered alternative medicine therapies in the United States. [ How to Treat CRPS With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-crps-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Chronic pain, changes in skin temperature, and swelling in a specific limb or body part? Pain, swollen limbs, edema and inflammation after a seemingly minor injury? These could be signs of a condition known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). Acupuncture and TCM can help relieve chronic pain due to CRPS. [CRPS](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/complex-regional-pain-syndrome) is a relatively rare condition that usually causes pain and [inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) in an arm or leg. It most often occurs after someone experiences an injury to a limb, or has surgery on one of their limbs. The painful area may be swollen, turn red and hot sometimes, and blue and cold at other times. CRPS is marked by [pain that seems disproportionate](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/reflex-sympathetic-dystrophy-syndrome/) to the injury or outside stimulus. For example, a person with CRPS may feel severe pain when the affected area is touched lightly, or when a breeze blows. While CRPS is not fully understood by medical science, it is generally considered to be a neurological disorder. While most cases of CRPS do improve in the long run, there may be a long period of time during which the injured area seems to be getting more inflamed. CRPS pain may worsen and spread to involve more of the affected limb. In some cases, the pain may even be \"mirrored\" in the opposite limb. This is partially why CRPS is theorized to be caused by problems with the nervous system. Sometimes CRPS manifests without any evidence of nerve damage. This condition is known as CRPS-I, or [Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/brain-and-nerves/chronic-pain/types/rsds.html). (RSD or RSDS). Some cases of CRPS can be associated with proven nerve damage; this is called \"causalgia,\" or CRPS-II. Conventional Western medicine approaches primarily focus on managing symptoms with pain medications and physical therapy. In some cases, CRPS pain can be so severe that it causes disability, as the person cannot use their limb normally in daily activities. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and acupuncture can help address the root causes of CRPS. Acupuncture and TCM offer a holistic approach to relieve pain and enhance overall well-being. Top 5 Symptoms of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) CRPS symptoms can change. A CRPS flare up may last days or weeks, when pain and swelling get worse. Sometimes, the pain may seem to come out of nowhere; other times, it may be triggered by exertion, stress, or other factors. - Intense and prolonged pain: Individuals with CRPS experience severe and persistent pain that may seem disproportionate to the initial injury or cause. There may be \"pins and needles\" or a burning sensation. Light contact with something may cause severe pain; this phenomenon is known as \"allodynia.\" Or something that would usually cause mild pain, like a pin prick, causes severed pain; this is called \"hyperalgesia.\" - Changes in skin temperature and color: The affected area may become warmer or cooler compared to the surrounding areas, and skin may appear blotchy, pale, red, or blue or gray. - Swelling and sensitivity: Swelling, edema, and increased sensitivity to touch or even a slight breeze are common symptoms of CRPS. - Limited range of motion: Stiffness, muscle weakness, and difficulty moving the affected limb or body part may occur. There may be tremors or jerky motions of the limb. - Changes in skin texture, hair and nail growth: Abnormal hair and nail growth patterns, such as excessive hair growth or brittle nails, may develop in the affected area. The skin may become thinner or thicker, or may be shiny or scaly. CRPS may cause unusually heavy sweating in the affected area, or cause there to be a total absence of sweating in the area. Medical Treatment for CRPS In the realm of conventional medicine, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is understood as a multifaceted condition that often arises following an injury or trauma to a limb or body part. While the exact cause of CRPS is not fully understood, it is believed to involve abnormal responses of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Nerve damage, inflammation, and changes in blood flow are thought to play a role in the development of CRPS. Certain risk factors may increase an individual's susceptibility to the condition, such as a history of fractures, surgery, or repetitive motion injuries. Additionally, psychological factors and genetic predisposition may contribute to the development of CRPS. CRPS can be triggered by a variety of factors, including surgery, immobilization, infections, emotional stress and trauma. Diagnostic testing for CRPS may include a bone scan, x-rays, MRI, and a sweat production test. Medications recommended may include pain relievers, corticosteroids to help bring down inflammation, and nerve blocking injections. Low doses of ketamine are sometimes used to help relieve pain. Topical analgesics may help reduce sensitivity in the affected area, as may heat therapy. Other [therapies for CRPS](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crps-complex-regional-pain-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371156) may include biofeedback and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Mirror therapy, in which a person stands or sits in front of a mirror set-up that tricks the brain into thinking it sees the injured limb working the way the healthy limb does, can be helpful for retraining the nervous system. Acupuncture treatment for CRPS can work on multiple levels to help relieve pain, improve motor function, reduce inflammation, help heal nerves, and reduce stress. Can Acupuncture Help CRPS? In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is understood as a disruption in the flow of Qi (energy) and Blood in the affected area, leading to pain and dysfunction. According to TCM theory, the underlying causes of CRPS are often related to the stagnation of Qi and Blood, as well as the blockage of meridians (energy channels) that run through the affected limb or body part. TCM treatments aim to restore the smooth flow of Qi and Blood, harmonize the body's internal balance, and alleviate pain. Acupuncture, a key component of TCM, is believed to stimulate specific acupoints along the meridians, helping to regulate the nervous system's response and promote healing. Chinese herbal medicine is also commonly used in TCM to support the treatment of CRPS by addressing underlying imbalances and promoting overall well being. By addressing both the physical and energetic aspects of the condition, TCM aims to restore harmony and alleviate pain in individuals with CRPS. [One study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23113454/) looked at two soldiers whose upper extremities were injured in combat and were later diagnosed with CRPS. When conventional methods did not help relieve pain, they were given one or two acupuncture treatments per week for a few weeks. They had 80% improvement in pain and functionality and with no recurrence at a 20-month follow up. An individual [case study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21208130/) of a 34-year-old with CRPS showed improvement in pain and emotional well-being after a series of acupuncture treatments. When dealing with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), incorporating certain lifestyle changes, behavioral adjustments, dietary modifications, and home remedies can be beneficial in managing the condition. Here are some recommendations: Stress Management: Practicing stress-reducing techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, and mindfulness can help alleviate CRPS symptoms. Stress management techniques promote relaxation and can positively impact pain perception. - Gentle Exercise: Engaging in low-impact exercises like walking, swimming, or yoga can help improve blood circulation, maintain joint flexibility, and reduce muscle stiffness. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional or physical therapist to determine the most appropriate exercise program for your specific situation. - Heat and Cold Therapy: Applying heat packs or cold compresses to the affected area may provide temporary relief from pain and inflammation. Experiment with both methods to see which works best for you. Remember to protect your skin and avoid extreme temperatures. - Balanced Diet: Maintaining a healthy and well-balanced diet is crucial for overall well-being. Include nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid excessive consumption of processed foods, refined sugars, and caffeine, as they may contribute to inflammation and worsen symptoms. - Adequate Hydration: Staying hydrated is important for promoting optimal bodily function and supporting overall health. Aim to drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day to keep your body hydrated and support proper circulation. - Stress Reduction: CRPS symptoms can be exacerbated by stress. Engaging in activities that promote relaxation, such as hobbies, listening to soothing music, spending time in nature, or engaging in creative outlets, can help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. - Sleep Hygiene: Getting sufficient and quality sleep is essential for managing chronic pain conditions. Establish a regular sleep routine, create a comfortable sleep environment, and practice good sleep hygiene habits like avoiding electronic devices before bed. It's important to note that these lifestyle changes, behavioral adjustments, dietary modifications, and home remedies should complement your comprehensive treatment plan and be tailored to your individual needs. Consult with a healthcare professional or a qualified practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for personalized guidance and recommendations based on your specific condition and symptoms.

[ How to Treat Aphasia With Acupuncture and TCM (Scalp Acupuncture) ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-aphasia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm-scalp-acupuncture/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Difficulty speaking, reading or writing due to brain damage is known as \" [aphasia](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/aphasia).\" Different types of aphasia can develop after a person has a [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or head injury. Aphasia can also be a symptom of dementia. Acupuncture\u2014especially \"scalp acupuncture\"\u2014can help a person regain brain function and speech. [Aphasia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aphasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369518)\u2014sometimes called \"dysphasia\"\u2014 is a language disorder that occurs because a part of the brain that controls speech, comprehension, and communication is not functioning correctly. This is usually due to damage or pressure on that part of the brain. Scalp Acupuncture, sometimes called \"neuroacupuncture,\" is a specific technique that combines Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western medical understanding of neurology. Acupuncture needles are used to stimulate [points on the head](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/), or scalp, that have a direct effect on brain cells. Scalp acupuncture can be helpful in treating acute and chronic central nervous system disorders that cause aphasia, as well as cognitive difficulties, trouble with motor skills, and even paralysis. [Scalp Acupuncture](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2020/08210/efficacy_and_safety_of_scalp_acupuncture_in.62.aspx) can be used to help people regain brain function after having suffered a stroke or injury to the head. Aphasia is generally considered to be related to this type of damage, but speech problems and trouble with cognition and comprehension can often occur with other neurological disorders, too. This type of acupuncture treatment can also help people with neurological conditions such disorders cause problems with the way the brain communicates information and instructions to the organs and limbs via the nervous system; this is what leads to a wide variety of language and movement disorders. [Scalp acupuncture](https://www.aphasia.org/site/scalp-acupuncture/) can be used to help these conditions because it can stimulate malfunctioning brain cells to begin working properly again, encourage the growth of new brain cells, and reestablish connections between the brain and the rest of the central nervous system. Acupuncture can help improve some of the most common symptoms of neurological disorders like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and MS, including: - Aphasia [Headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Fatigue - Mood swings - Depression - Muscle spasms, stiff muscles [Seizures](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Tremor](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-essential-tremor-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Paralysis Scalp acupuncture can be an effective form of integrative medicine to help people overcome these symptoms, whether they are recovering from a stroke or suffering from a neurological disorder. What is Scalp Acupuncture? Acupuncture is one of several modalities used in TCM, which is a complete medical system with a history going back thousands of years. The stimulation of points on the head and/or scalp has always been used as a method for treating all types of symptoms and underlying conditions. [\"Scalp acupuncture\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3833481/) is a term that refers to a more specific, contemporary acupuncture technique that combines ancient TCM knowledge with modern medical understanding of the anatomy of the brain and the way parts of the brain interact with the nervous system to control various bodily and sensory functions. In Chinese Medicine, acupuncture points are usually chosen based on the theory of the meridians\u2014channels along which Qi (energy) moves through the body. Along each meridian lie several points that connect organ systems and parts of the body. This concept of a network system of meridians is more metaphorical in nature, rather than based on actual physiology. In TCM we may consider that a problem in one part of the body is related to an imbalance in a (seemingly) different organ system. For example, anxiety and heart palpitations might be treated by needling a point on the head that is on the Stomach meridian. In Western medicine, [\"somatotopic arrangement\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5998947/) describes the understanding of how parts of the brain, and particularly the nerve endings on the scalp, are arrayed in a pattern around the skull and correspond to different sensory functions, such as speech, visual perception, balance, and motor skills. With MRI technology, scientists have been able to \"map\" out how parts of the nervous system on the scalp correspond to parts of the body, like the feet, and the hands, etc. With the practice of scalp acupuncture, we are [combining these concepts](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.746567/full) and using acupuncture as a way of directly influencing parts of the brain, like the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum, etc. This can help both to heal parts of the brain that might be damaged due to a stroke, and to regulate functioning of those parts, so as to help restore proper functioning of motor activities and the senses. This technique involves the insertion of small acupuncture needles into the tissues just beneath the surface of the skin on the scalp. Then, the needles may be be stimulated, either by manually twisting, or with [electro-acupuncture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/electroacupuncture) (sometimes called \"electro-stim\"). Here, we attach small electrodes to the needles, and a mild to medium level of electric current flows to activate a vibration and/or rotation. As part of the goal is to reactivate nervous system connections, the patient may be asked to be active during the treatment; that is, by moving the part of the body that is experiencing weak movement, or at least, to visualize or imagine themselves performing the movement. [One study](http://www.itmonline.org/arts/newscalp.htm) of patients being treated with scalp acupuncture for aphasia showed that 46% showed \"marked improvement,\" while almost all patients showed some improvement. In a [study](http://www.itmonline.org/arts/newscalp.htm) of scalp acupuncture for treatment of paralysis, all patients showed improvement, while 68% were cured. While more research is needed, it is also believed that scalp acupuncture may be a good [alternative therapy](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66440) to help treat m [ental health issues](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-improve-mental-health-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), like [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), and [PTSD](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), as well as sleep disorders, like [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/).

[ How to Treat Encephalitis With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-encephalitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) & Qineng Headache, sensitivity to light, stiff neck, short-term memory loss? These could be signs of encephalitis, or inflammation in the brain. Infectious encephalitis can happen due to an infection; [autoimmune encephalitis (AIE)](https://www.ohsu.edu/brain-institute/autoimmune-encephalitis) is a type of autoimmune disorder. Acupuncture and TCM offer an [adjunct treatment](http://thnm.adam.com/content.aspx?productid=107&pid=33&gid=000056) for encephalitis recovery. What is encephalitis? [Encephalitis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/encephalitis) refers to a serious condition in which the tissues of the brain become inflamed. It can happen to anyone, but is more common among children and older people. The symptoms of encephalitis are sometimes ignored, because [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [neck pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and \"brain fog\" are so common and may not seem that serious at first. However, in combination, these signs should not be taken lightly. Like [meningitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-meningitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord), encephalitis can cause serious complications if left untreated. Encephalitis needs to be caught early and treated in order for people to make a full recovery. What causes encephalitis? Brain inflammation can be caused by the body's immune response to an infection, or due to an autoimmune disorder, in which the body produces antibodies that attack the brain tissues. Top 10 Causes of Encephalitis Viral infections are the primary reason that people develop encephalitis. These could be viruses carried by insects, especially mosquitoes, which are then contracted by humans through bites. Other communicable viral infections that pass from person to person through bodily fluids or close contact can also cause infectious encephalitis. Infections that can lead to encephalitis include: - Mosquito-borne viruses such as: West Nile Louis encephalitis, LaCrosse encephalitis - Tick-borne viruses - Rabies virus - can be contracted through being bitten by an infected animal - Polio virus [Herpes Simplex](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-herpes-simplex-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), Type 1 and Type 2 (HPV1 and HPV2) [Epstein-Barr virus (mono, mononucleosis)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-mononucleosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) (rubeola) - German measles (rubella) - Mumps There have been cases of people developing encephalitis as a [complication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33982853/) of a COVID-19 infection. Some cases of encephalitis can be caused by bacterial or fungal infections, or by a parasite. It could also be caused by exposure to some sort of [allergen](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-allergy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or toxin in the environment. People with weakened immune systems\u2014for example, due to [HIV/AIDs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hiv-aids-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)\u2014or who take immunosuppressant medications are at a higher risk for developing encephalitis. Immunotherapy used to treat certain kinds of [cancer](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/), such as [melanoma](https://journals.lww.com/immunotherapy-journal/Abstract/2020/09000/Encephalitis_in_a_Patient_With_Melanoma_Treated.3.aspx), [ovarian cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6003404/) or [lung cancer,](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32200139/) has been shown to cause encephalitis in some cases. Some cases of autoimmune encephalitis, called [Anti-NMDAR encephalitis](https://www.heighpubs.org/cjog/cjog-aid1018.php), appear to be related to a certain kind of tumor called a teteroma. In women and young women, especially, this can be an ovarian tumor that produces the antibodies for NMDAR. Symptoms of Encephalitis A mild case of encephalitis might only cause some flu-like symptoms that clear up within a few weeks. These types of symptoms include: - Headache - Stiff neck, neck pain - Muscle aches, joint pain - Fever - Fatigue, feeling tired and weak - Sensitivity to light More severe symptoms of encephalitis can affect both cognitive and motor function: - Mental confusion, brain fog, difficulty concentrating - Memory problems, short term [memory loss](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Hallucinations [Seizures](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Severe headache - Trouble with coordination or balance - Loss of sensations in parts of the body or face [Loss of muscle control](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ataxia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)in parts of the body or [face](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bells-palsy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Problems with speaking or hearing - Mood swings, changes in personality Anti-NMDAR encephalitis (when there may be an ovarian tumor involved, especially) can cause symptoms like pro-domal headache, nausea, and fever, which may then progress to more severe complications, including involuntary movements or [tremors](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-essential-tremor-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), urinary incontinence, [rapid heartbeat](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and psychiatric symptoms like [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), paranoia, or mania. In severe cases, [encephalitis can cause](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/encephalitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20356136) loss of consciousness and even cause a person to go into a coma. It is very important to seek urgent medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms. Treatment for Encephalitis Blood tests can confirm whether a viral or bacterial infection is causing encephalitis. Imaging tests like an MRI or CT scan may show the inflammation in the brain. A spinal tap may show an imbalance in cerebral fluids, or an EEG may show unusual electrical impulses in the brain. However, there are times when [these tests](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6058-encephalitis#diagnosis-and-tests) will not show exactly what is causing the encephalitis. As with many autoimmune disorders, it can be hard to pinpoint a clear diagnosis for autoimmune encephalitis (AIE). Medical treatment for encephalitis will depend on what type it is determined to be. Mild inflammation will usually be treated with over the counter anti-inflammatory medications. Antivirals or antibiotics will be prescribed if a specific infection is found to be the cause. Steroids will often be used to help reduce inflammation. In more serious cases, a person may require breathing assistance or anti-seizure medications. In cases where the cause is believed to be an autoimmune response, immunotherapy is used to try to interfere with the antibodies that are attacking the brain tissues. Steroids will be usually used in combination with other treatments. Plasmapheresis, or plasma exchange, removes some of these antibodies from the blood. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy introduces healthy antibodies to block the action of the malfunctioning antibodies. In cases of anti-NMDAR encephalitis where a tumor is present, [treatment](https://www.news-medical.net/health/Autoimmune-Encephalitis-Treatment.aspx) will include the removal of the tumor in addition to immunotherapy. Patients with this type of encephalitis may also be prescribed antipsychotic drugs to relieve psychiatric symptoms. Immunotherapy works for some patients, but not all. Many patients will be offered second-line treatments such as monoclonal antibodies or antimetabolites. In some cases, people may seem to recover from encephalitis for a while, and then have a relapse in which the inflammation flares up again. Most people will need significant time and rehabilitation to help them make a [full recovery](https://aealliance.org/patient-support/recovery/) from encephalitis. Some people will have long-lasting effects, such as memory problems, balance and coordination issues, speech problems, and emotional volatility. Many of the pharmaceutical treatments available for encephalitis cause significant side effects and can even lead to more physical, emotional and mental health issues. Fortunately, acupuncture and other TCM modalities offer a way to reduce inflammation in the brain and help relieve encephalitis, as well as helping to offset any side effects from other medical interventions. Can Acupuncture Help Encephalitis? With acupuncture and Chinese herbs, we seek to treat the root cause and the various symptoms and complications of each condition according to recognizable patterns. This allows us to effectively treat some conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders, and inflammatory conditions that may not readily respond to conventional medicine. In the TCM view, inflammation occurs because there is too much heat in the body. Yang energy provides the \"fire\" we need to keep the body warm and energetic. But, if there is an imbalance, and too much heat, this leads to conditions like fever, infections, and inflammation. So, we see pathogenic internal heat as contributing to encephalitis, in addition to outside pathogens like viruses or bacteria. To [clear heat](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S222541101630222X) that is trapped or stagnant in the body, we will use specific herbs and cooling foods, along with acupuncture treatment and lifestyle changes to reduce physical and mental stress. TCM herbs can also be highly effective against bacterial and viral infections. The motor control and cognitive problems that can result from encephalitis occur because the inflammation in the brain is affecting the functioning of the central nervous system. With acupuncture, we can help to reestablish connections and neural pathways. Autoimmune disorders are still not well understood by Western medicine, but with acupuncture we can help to balance and regulate the immune system, so that it is not being inappropriately triggered. This is why acupuncture works well as an [adjunct treatment](https://atm.amegroups.com/article/view/35639/html) for encephalitis and many other autoimmune disorders.

[ How to Treat Occipital Neuralgia With Acupuncture and TCM & Xiaomei neck pain? [Occipital Neuralgia](https://www.aans.org/en/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Occipital-Neuralgia), sometimes called \"occipital migraine,\" is a kind of chronic headache that causes stabbing neck pain and headache back of head. [Acupuncture](https://medicalnewsbulletin.com/acupuncture-for-occipital-neuralgia/) and TCM offer a way to help ease occipital nerve pain. [Occipital headache](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/occipital-neuralgia) causes are usually due to compression of the occipital nerves, which start at the top of the spine where the neck is joined to the head and then run up into the scalp. A pinched nerve in the neck area, or tight muscles in the neck can lead to occipital pain, like a headache at base of skull. [Neck pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and back of head pain from an occipital migraine is often described as feeling like an electric shock or \"zap,\" or a sharp, shooting pain in the back of the head. The sensation may come on suddenly and last for only a few seconds, or it can go on throbbing for hours. [Occipital neuralgia](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/occipital-neuralgia) pain is similar to that of [Trigeminal Neuralgia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-trigeminal-neuralgia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), in which the intense nerve pain is on one side of the face, rather than the back part of the head. Occipital pain [can also resemble](https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/occipital-neuralgia/) that of chronic [migraines](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and other kinds of [headache](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) disorders. Occipital Neuralgia pain areas can include: - Pain starts in the back of the neck and spreads upwards - Back of head pain, behind the ears - Pain on one side of the head - Scalp pain, scalp tender to the touch - Pain in the forehead - Pain behind the eyes - Eyes are sensitive to light Occipital neuralgia pain can make the scalp feel so sensitive that even shampooing your hair or resting your head on a pillow feels unbearable. It can also feel like a burning sensation, or simply an aching neck. [Acupuncture](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=31583) can be used as an alternative or adjunct therapy for occipital neuralgia to bring headache and neck pain relief. What Causes Occipital Neuralgia? Occipital neuralgia occurs when the occipital nerves in the back of the head and neck are irritated or injured. There can be many different kinds of factors that trigger occipital neuralgia, such as: - Pinched nerve in the neck - Tension or tight muscles in the neck cause compression - Compression of the nerves due to osteoarthritis in the spine, degenerative disc disease, or a [herniated disk](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-herniated-disc-with-acupuncture-tcm/) - Trauma to the back of the head or the neck - Tumor or other type of lesion in neck compresses the nerves [Gout](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-gout-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Vasculitis (inflamed blood vessels) Holding the head and neck in a position where it is tilted forward and down, such as when reading or looking at a screen for long periods of time can be associated with occipital neuralgia. Often, though, the exact cause of the occipital pain in the head and neck is not discovered. There is no clear test used to diagnose occipital neuralgia. The symptoms of occipital nerve pain are similar to other types of migraine headaches, and it is possible for a person to have both migraines and occipital neuralgia, so it can be challenging for doctors to determine exactly what is going on. Conventional Treatment for Occipital Neuralgia One of the ways that medical doctors will try to confirm a [diagnosis of Occipital Neuralgia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23072-occipital-neuralgia) is by injecting a combination of anesthetic and steroids (occipital nerve block) into the affected area, to see if it deadens the pain. [Botox injections](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2745973) can also be used to produce this effect. The hope is that the irritated nerve will heal over time. If neck tension seems to be the issue, muscle relaxants may be prescribed. Massage therapy can sometimes be helpful in these cases. Occipital neuralgia treatment at home might involve alternating ice packs and heating pads to help relieve pain at the back of the neck. Exercises like yoga may also be helpful for relieving neck tension that triggers the nerve pain. If none of these treatments provides relief, then surgical options might include occipital nerve stimulation, in which electrodes are implanted to block nerve signals. [Acupuncture and TCM](https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-020-02955-y) can be sought as an alternative way to deal with occipital neuralgia, and many other types of nerve pain. Can Acupuncture Help Occipital Neuralgia? From the TCM point of view, pain conditions that come and go, or cause periodic pain and stiffness, fall under a category called \"Bi Syndromes.\" \"Bi\" means \"obstruction.\" Bi Syndromes occur when an external pathogenic force like wind, cold, or dampness gets into an area of the body and causes blockages in the flow of Qi. Then, the muscles and joints may be tender, swollen, or sore, or numb and tingling, or have limited range of movement. Most types of [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), for example, are Bi Syndromes, according to TCM theory. Occipital neuralgia is considered a Bi Syndrome, where tightness in the neck and base of the skull causes the stabbing nerve pain to flare up. The goals of acupuncture treatment for occipital headache and neck pain are to reduce tension, [stress,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and [inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/), to clear blockages in the Qi at the organ system level, and to provide natural analgesic relief from nerve pain signals. One [case study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6883661/) of a patient who had been suffering from occipital headaches for over a year found that her pain resolved after five acupuncture treatments. A [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7268636/) of evidence related to TCM treatment for occipital neuralgia in China showed that acupuncture was effective both as an alternative to medical treatment, and as an adjunct to medicine. Acupuncture Near Me for Occipital Neuralgia in Los Angeles At Art of Wellness Acupuncture near Santa Monica and Brentwood, we have over 30 years of experience helping people heal from all kinds of neurological conditions and nerve pain. Conditions related to nerve compression, such as [Carpal Tunnel syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-with-acupuncture-tcm/) (wrist pain), [Morton's Neuroma](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-mortons-neuroma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) (ball of foot pain), [ Sciatica](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hip-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) (hip pain), [Plantar Fasciitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-heel-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) (heel pain), and even [dental pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) (toothaches) can all be relieved with acupuncture and TCM treatment.
