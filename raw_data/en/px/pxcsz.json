Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 6 I.Executive SummaryAdventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 7 Nonprofit hospitals conduct a community health needs assessment or CHNA every three years in order to maintain tax exempt status as required under California State Senate Bill 697 (SB 697) originally enacted in 1994. The requirement was expanded to the federal level thereafter and further solidified in 2010 under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). As in previous years, Glendale hospitals - Adventist Health Glendale and Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center - have partnered to conduct the 2019 CHNA in collaboration with the Center for Nonprofit Management consulting team. As part of the CHNA, the hospitals have jointly collected and analyzed prim ary data from individuals in the community through focus groups with public health experts , representatives of government and civic organizations , social service providers, community residents, leaders, and other relevant individuals. Appendix B presents the data collection tools, and Appendix C lists the stakeholders involved. Concurrently, extensive secondary data were collected and compared to relevant benchmarks including Healthy People 2020, Los Angeles County , or California when possible. T he data were also collected by ZIP code, when available, to allow for more in -depth analysis and identification of health issues. In addition, previous CHNA reports were reviewed to identify trends and ensure that previously identified needs were not overl ooked. Primary and secondary data were compiled into a scorecard ( Appendix A) presenting health needs with highlighted comparisons to the available data benchmarks. The scorecard was designed to allow for a comprehensive analysis across all data sources (A ppendix D) and for use during the second, prioritization phase of the CHNA process. The 2019 CHNA process included a prioritization process involving a facilitated group session that engaged key community stakeholders in a discussion of secondary and prima ry data (compiled and presented in the scorecards and accompa nying health need narratives). At the session, participants were provided with a brief overview of the CHNA process and a list of community indicators in a scorecard format. In smaller groups, participants considered the data while discussing and identifying key issues or considerations that were then shared with the larger group. As a follow -up to this discussion, participants and other members of the hospitals ' network \u2014including the Glendale He althier Community Coalition \u2014completed a questionnaire (hard copy and online) about health needs and resources, and ranked each health need according to several criteria including severity, change over time, resources available to address the need and commu nity readiness to support action on behalf of any health need. The survey results were used to compare and prioritize the health needs identified at the session. This list of health needs will inform the hospital's community benefit program focus and strat egies for the period covering 2019 to 202 2. The following full Community Health Needs Assessment provides extensive data and supportive information regarding the assessment process as well as relevant data and analysis of the identified community needs and health determinants. Rank Health Needs 1 Homelessness/Poverty 2 Mental Health/ Substance Abuse 3 Access to Care 4 Cardiovascular Disease 5 Preventative Wellness 6 Dental Health 7 Obesity 8 Geriatric Care 9 Diabetes Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 8 II.BACKGROUND & METHODOLOGY Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 9 Purpose and Key Partners In 1994, the California Legislature enacted Senate Bill 697 (SB 697) which required nonprofit hospitals to complete CHNAs every three years. As part of SB 697, hospitals are also required to annually submit a summary of their Community Benefit contributions, particularly those activities undertaken to address the community needs that arose during the CHNA. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted on March 23, 2010, included new stipulations for hospital organizations to maintain their 501(c)(3) status. With regard to the CHNA, the ACA specifically requires non profit hospitals to collect and consider input from public health experts as well as community leaders and representatives of high -need populations (including minority groups, low-income individuals, medically underserved populations, and those with chronic conditions); identify and prioritize community health needs; document a separate CHNA for each individual hospital; and make the CH NA report widely available to the public. In addition, each nonprofit hospital must adopt an implementation strategy to address the identified community health needs and submit a copy of the implementation strategy along with the organization's annual Form 990. 1 Glendale Hospital Collaborative Adventist Health Glendale (AHGL) The Glendale Sanitarium opened in 1905, a year before Glendale was founded as a city. By the 1920s, it expanded its medical, surgical, and maternity services, and offered the most advanced medical equipment of the day. Given its growth, a 30 -acre hillside was selected for a new hospital location. Overlooking Wilson Avenue, the new and expanded facility opened in the mid -1920s. The current hospital remains on this location today. In the 1970s, the ho spital's name changed to Glendale Adventist Medical Center (GAMC ) and in the early 2000s, GAMC began a $220 -million renovation and building project, which included the West Tower, the Emergency Department and the Lee Hughes Medical Building. In 2017, the h ospital 's name was changed to Adventist Health Glendale (AHGL). The Glendale hospital employs 800 physicians, 2,600 associates and 1,100 volunteers 2 Currently, AHGL is also recognized as: 1 For more Recognitions High performing medical center by U.S. News & World Report in five types of care, including COPD, geriatrics, heart failure, neurology and orthopedics in 2017- 18 'A' Rating from The Leapfrog Group for Fall 2017 for Hospital Safety \"Top Docs\" by Pasadena Magazine 2017 Guidelines\u00ae -Gold Plus and the Target Stroke Honor Roll Elite award from the American Stroke Association First medical center in California to receive Comprehensive St roke Center accreditation from DNV -GL Healthcare USA, Inc.

A hospital specially equipped and staffed for the rapid, quality car e of heart attack patients by Los Angeles County's Emergency Medical Services Glendale Memorial Hospital & Health Center ( GMHHC ) Glendale Memorial Hospital & Health Center (GMHHC) works in close collaboration with other hospitals serving the Glendale community in cluding Glendale Adventist Medical Center a nd USC Verdugo Hills Hospital. These hospitals joined together to conduct one data gathering process and one stakeholder engagement effort in order to better utilize resources and reduce the burden of calling upon communi ty members for input. Founded in 1926 as Physicians and Surgeons Hospital by six Glendale community members with a vision to expand health care services to the residents of south Glendale, GMHHC has grown from the original 47 beds to a 334 -bed acute care community hospital offering primary service lines in heart, cancer, orthopedics, women's health, colorectal disease, emergency medicine, and diagnostic imaging services. GMHHC is a part of Dignity Healthcare, a system with 39 hospitals located in California, Nevada, and Arizona. The hospital employs over 1,050 people with medical staff of 525 physicians . 3 Glendale Memorial Hospital's service area includes the communities of Glendale, Burbank, La Crescenta, Montrose, Atwater Village, Eagle Rock, Echo Park, Glassell Park, Highland Park, Hollywood, North Hollywood, Los Feliz, and Silver Lake. 3 Community Benefit 2018 Report and 2019 Plan, Dignity Health Glendale Memorial Hospital.

Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 11 Needs Assessment Methodology and Process The CHNA process is designed (1) to develop a deeper understanding of commun ity healthcare needs, (2) to inform each hospital's community benefit plan for outreach and services that complement and extend clinical services, and (3) to improve disease prevention and overall health status. The CHNA process unfol ds in a three -step pr ocess outlined below. This CHNA report is the culmination of the Glendale Hospitals' efforts to complete Phase 1 and will inform Phase 2 and 3 for each ho spital. As part of Phase 1, both primary data via community input and secondary data were collected to inform community health priorities and needs, as well as assets and gaps in resources. The chart below high lights the process: STEP 1 : Primary Data Collection and Analysis (Part 1): Community Stakeholder Input The goal of this component of the CHNA was to identify broad health outcomes and drivers (which, combined are health needs), as well as assets and gaps in resources, through the perceptions and knowledge of varied and multiple stakeholders. Leveraging its extensive network of communi ty partners, the hospitals, in collaboration with the Glendale Healthier Community Coalition , held a community summit on October 25, 2018 , with 95 stakeholders. In compliance with the ACA, participants represented a broad range of geographic, public health, and population interest including health care professionals, social service providers, city and public health officials, members from the local police department , and other community leaders (Appendix C \u2014Stakeholders). For more information on the focus group process, see Appendix B \u2014 Primary Data Gathering Tools. To begin to gain a sense of the perceived severity of each health need in the communit y, each participant was given ten sticker dots and asked to vote for the most severe health needs on a grid created during the focus group. For the purpose of the voting activity, severity was defined as the level to which a health need or health driver affected the health and l ives of those in the community. Primary Data Collection: Stakeholder InputSecondary Data CollectionIdentify and Assess Trends Identify Disproportion ately Affected PopulationsPrimary Data Collection: Community Input and SurveyAdventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 12 The CNM consultant team used a modified content analysis to identify the main themes that emerged from community input through the facilitated groups . CNM used a three -step process for analyzing and interpreting primary data (community input): 1) all information gathered during focus groups were entered into Microsoft Excel, 2) spreadsheet data were reviewed multiple times using content analysis to begin sorting and coding the data, and 3) through the c oding process, themes, categories and quotes were identified. Analysis to Identify Main Themes Emerged Via Community Input In the coding process, two requirements needed to be met: 1) a health need had to be mentioned in the primary data collection more than once and 2) a secondary data indicator associated with the need had to perform poorly against a designated benchmark (county averages, state averages, or Healthy People 2020 goals). Once a theme met both requirements, it was designated as an id entified health need/indicator. The graphic below outlines the identified health indicators, in alphabetical order . Access to Health Care Cancer Cardiovascular Communicable Diseases Dental Care Diabetes Geriatric Support Homelessness/Poverty Mental Health Violence/Injury Obesity Preventive Wellness Sexual Health Stroke Substance Abuse Transportation Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 13 STEP 2 : Secondary Data Collection The CHNA included the collection of over 300 data indicators that helped illustrate the health states of the community. Secondary data were collected from a wide range of local, county, state and national sources to present demographics, mortality, morbidity, health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. Wherever available, data at the ZIP Code level were compiled for the hospital's service area. When not available by ZIP Code, then the data for the appropriate representative portion of the Service Planning Area (SPA) was utilized. A comprehensive data matrix, known as the \"Scorecard\", was created listing all identified secondary indicators. The Scorecard included three benchmark datapoints: (1) State of California, (2) Los Angeles County , and (3) nationally recognized Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) goals. Please see Appendix A. STEP 3 : Primary Data Collection and Analysis (Part 2): Community Input and Survey In October 2018, a daylong Health Summit was held that included discussions throughout the day that were facilitated with the 91 community participants regarding the health of the Glendale community. In addition, a total of 66 community stakeholders ( See A ppendix C -Stakeholders ) was convened April 4, 2019 for a Prioritization Forum with the goal of ranking the identified health needs. Many of the F orum participants had also attended the first focus group. Participants received the Scorecard and hospital data and allowed time to review and discuss in small groups. CNM consultants were available to answer data questions. After a large group discussion, participants were given the opportunity to provide input via voting and a survey. For details, please see Appendix B - Primary Data Gathe ring Tools. All participants were given sticker dots (10 sticker dots each), presented with the list of identified health needs and asked to cast their sticker votes for the most severe health needs in the community, which were then tabulated. Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 14 Post -voting , participants were asked to complete a written survey that presented the identified health needs, and asked to score each health need based on the following criteria: severity of the health need in the community change over time (improved or gotten worse) availability of community resources community readiness to address the health need Participants were given a companion document that further explained the four criteria and the scoring system. Absent participants could complete the survey online if the y were not able to attend the Prioritization Forum. A total of 37 participants completed the survey . The survey and the companion document can be found in the Appendix B \u2014Primary Data Gathering Tools. Data Limitations and Gaps The secondary data allows for an examination of the broad health needs within a community. However, these data have limitations , as is true with any secondary data: Data were not always available at the ZIP code level, so Los Angeles C ounty level data as well as SPA level data were utilized. Disaggregated data for age, ethnicity, race, and gender are not available for all data indicators, which limited the examination of disparities of health issues within the community. At times, a stakeholder -identified a health issue may not have been reflected by the secondary data indicators. Data are not always collected on an annual basis, meaning that some data are several years old. Prioritized Health Needs Using the primary and secondary data collected , the foll owing prio ritized health needs were identified for Adventist Health Glendale and Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center. Rank Health Needs 1 Homelessness/Poverty 2 Mental Health/ Substance Abuse 3 Access to Care 4 Cardiovascular Disease 5 Preventative Wellness 6 Dental Health 7 Obesity 8 Geriatric Care 9 Diabetes Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 15 2016- 2018 CHNA Three -Year Report Identified Priority Areas and Responses 2016 to the present has been a time of goal -setting and achievement for Adventist Health Glendale (AHGL). AHGL's recent successes were recognized in Spring 2019, with the hospital's ninth consecutive 'A' from The Leapfrog Group's Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade. The award recognizes AHGL for its efforts in protecting patients from harm and meeting the highest safety standards in the U.S. AHGL is among the top 4% of hospitals graded nationwide, and the only hospital in the Glendale/Burbank area to receive nin e 'straight A's' from 2016 through 2019, four years in a row. Priority Area 1: Cardiovascular Health - Integrate Patient Education into Cardiovascular Services Increasing access to and/or number of impactful community educational events providing heart health education and related health screenings was the initial goal for this priority area. Short - term evaluation indicators included the number of sites created for community -based management of heart disease, and community members' ability to monitor their health and disease. In 2015, the Hospital added the goal of improving cardiovascular patients' ED experience through the implementation of a system to more accurately record patients' ED arrival times. Progress related to short -term evaluation indicators is demonstrated by the opening of the Heart and Vascular Inst itute, monitoring and education for heart failure patients by the Care Transitions Team to reduce readmissions, and the implementation of a green arm band door time process to ensure accurate patient arrival time. Cardiovascular Health Response 1: The ne ed was identified to educate community residents regarding early signs of heart attack. \"Did you know heart attacks have early signs? Do you know how to recognize them and get help? Take the early heart attack care (EHAC) education course and learn how to potentially save someone's life!\" (Note: Course takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.) The Early Heart Attack Education (EHAC) course, provided to the community, reviews the signs and symptoms of a heart attack and the importance of calling 911. This information has also been made available on flyers, magnets, and on the hospital website. AHGL also collaborated with the L.A. County STEMI center to obtain two standing screens that display the signs and symptoms of acute coronary syndrome, the cardiovas cular differences between men and women, and the importance of calling 911 when these symptoms are spotted. These screens are displayed at events in the community and on our hospital grounds for the community to see. AHGL also offers free blood pressure an d BMI screenings at the Glendale Galleria shopping mall via a state -of- the-art blood pressure kiosk. A touch screen available in the kiosk offers information on cardiovascular risk and offers the community an opportunity to receive emails to help them learn more about risk reduction and response resources available at AHGL. Cardiovascular Health Response 2: The need was identified to educate community residents and medical providers on risk and symptoms for aortic stenosis. The TAVR team of interventional cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons at AHGL is paving the way to save lives with a new technology. TAVR enables patients with severe aortic stenosis to receive a new heart valve without undergoing open heart surgery. \"It's revolutionary. It's minima lly invasive. It's saving lives. It's TAVR.\" Aortic stenosis (AS) is a condition in which progressive obstruction of blood flow across the aortic valve results in pressure hypertrophy of the left ventricle and can present as classic symptoms of angina, heart failure and even sudden death. The echocardiogram is the standard Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 16 for identifying severe aortic stenosis. This procedure is fairly new and is FDA approved for people with symptomatic aortic stenosis who are considered an intermediate or high -risk patien t for standard valve replacement surgery. Cardiovascular Health Response 3: Cardiology works alongside cardiac rehab to provide education for patients post open heart surgeries. Cardiac rehab open heart classes last for approximately an hour and are held every fourth Thursday of the month. Patients come in to speak with the open -heart nurse and ask questions about their current condition, what they went through, and the healing process. The class provides a community for those who feel isolated after thei r cardiac event and allows for unanswered questions to be answered. Patients consistently express their satisfaction with this class and how they appreciate the monthly meetings. For improving access to cardiovascular services, AHGL has received the follo wing Cardiovascular Health Awards: Adventist Health Glendale is designated a STEMI (ST- Elevation Myocardial Infarction) Receiving Center. This designation, given by L.A. County's Emergency Medical Services, recognizes hospitals that are specially equipped and staffed for the rapid, quality care of heart attack patients. Adventist Health Glendale is one of the few accredited chest pain centers in the region. The accreditation is awarded by the Society of Cardiovascular Patient Care to medical centers that combine evidence -based science, quality initiatives, guidelines and clinical best practices into effective care for patients with chest pain. For 2017 -18, Adventist Health Glendale was rated a high performing medical center by U.S. News & World Report in five types of care, including COPD, geriatrics, heart failure, neurology and orthopedics. U.S. News created Best Hospitals for Common Care to help patients find better care for the kinds of common procedures and medical conditions that account for millions of hospitalizations each year.

Short -term evaluation indicators included increasing the proportion of adults who have had their blood pressure measured within the preceding 2 years and can state whether their blood pressure was normal or high, the reach of stroke support groups, the Stroke Medication Management and Education Clinic, impact of stroke awareness and stroke risk assessment activities. Progress related to short- term evaluation indicators is demonstrated by the successful implem entation of 57 blood pressure screenings in 2015, ongoing Stroke Support Group activities, and community and patient education by the Neuroscience Institute. Stroke Education Response 1: The need was identified to improve prevention, detection, and treat ment for stroke among community residents. AHGL provided stoke education and awareness to the community in on and off -site settings to Live Well Senior Center participants and paramedics. Presentations were offered to increase knowledge of signs and sympto ms of stroke, risk factors, and support services for stroke survivors. Blood pressure screening and pre - and post -program survey were also incorporated to assess program effectiveness. Each year, the Neuroscience Institute stroke program has served over 15 0 participants in the Glendale region. Stroke Education Response 2: AHGL created a Community Mobility Program for people who have had a stroke and are experiencing neurological deficits that may impair driving ability. Because the loss of driving ability is one of the most difficult losses stroke patients face, AHGL offers this service to evaluate patients from a clinical and an on the road perspective to determine driving ability. Some are evaluated as being able to drive immediately; some as needing special training, and others as having lost the dexterity to drive again. AHGL's Community Mobility Program is operated in partnership with the Department of Motor Vehicles. Stroke Education Response 3: The AHGL Neuroscience Institute offers FREE Stroke Med ication Management & Education Clinics - the first of its kind in the community. Stroke patients receive a consultation with AHGL pharmacist including answers to their medication/ prescription questions, discussing adjustments to medication dosage (if nece ssary) and receiving guidance regarding post -stroke rehabilitation. Armenian - and Spanish -speaking pharmacists are also available for patients upon request. In addition to continued marketing initiatives through the AHGL website and Health Quarterly, Pharm acy consults are built into our process to ensure patients receive a free consultation from the pharmacist prior to discharge. The signs and symptoms of a stroke are also available on our stroke education web page. Learn more about stroke on Healthline, AHGL's health education cable TV show hosted by Dr. Gregory Zarian. For improving access to stroke education, detection, and treatment services, AHGL has received the following Stroke Care Awards: Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 18 Adventist Health Glendale is the first medical center in California to receive Comprehensive Stroke Center accreditation from DNV -GL Healthcare USA, Inc. By earning this prestigious accreditation, Adventist Health Glendale has demonstrated that it exceeds patient safety standards set forth by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Brain Attack Coalition and the American Stroke Association. In 2017, Adventist Health Glendale received the Get With the Guidelines\u00ae -Gold Plus and the Target Stroke Honor Roll Elite award from the American Stroke Associat ion for excellence in stroke care. Hospitals receiving the Stroke Gold Plus Award have reached an aggressive goal of treating patients with 85% or higher compliance to core standards. Priority Need 2 - Improve Stroke Education and Support - Partners Amer ican Heart/ Stroke Association National Stroke Association Center for Neuro Skills Los Angeles Stroke Coordinator's Network (LASCN) Department of Motor Vehicles Genentech Priority Area 3: Population Health for Chronic Disease Reducing the illness, disability and number of deaths caused by chronic disease (principally diabetes) among low -income, at -risk and vulnerable populations in the AHGL service area was the initial goal for this priority area. An increase in the healthy behaviors of vulnerable populations, including a special focus on children 0 -5 and their family members who may be at risk for chronic disease was selected as the short -term evaluation indicator for this priority area. Progress related to short -term evaluation indicators is demonstrated by program activities including the successful completion of various outreach efforts engaging over 5,000 community members by the AHGL chapter of Choose Health LA Kids. Chronic Disease Response 1: The need was identified to address the root causes of chronic disease among community residents. Champions for Change (C4C) is a population -health disease prevention campaign that aims to decrease statewide rates of obesity and chronic illnesses. Under C4C funding, AHGL reaches children between the ages of four and eight, and their families, in Glendale. AHGL programs under C4C funding to help families implement and sustain healthy practices include nutrition workshops, food dem onstrations, gardening, Zumba, and Rethink Your Drink, an effort that focuses on reducing the consumption of high sugar beverages while promoting alternatives such as water. This three -year program followed on the heels of another three- year program called Choose Health L.A. Key efforts under Champions for Change include teaching fundamental skills such as cooking, reading food labels, shopping on a budget, growing fruits and vegetables, and introducing low -cost and fun ways to be physically active. Under $ 300,000 in annual funding, Champions for Change has served over 700 participants each year in the Glendale region. Individual programs included: C4C added nutrition classes to a Glendale Unified School District after school sports program in which eight e lementary schools participated in a range of sports. We also trained district coaches in healthy options, and as a group, the coaches pledged to drink only water and healthy drinks for the length of the program in order to set a good example for the childr en. Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 19 C4C provided a nutrition and gardening program for the students of Thomas Edison Elementary school. Students learned about plant care, nutritional labels, and the health benefits of drinkingwater instead of sugary drinks. Using vegetables from the garden had children eating vegetables with enthusiasm \u2014they were excited about recipes such as salsa made with the tomatoes and radishes they had grown and nurtured themselves. The kindergarten students made up their own names for the days the program was hel d: \"Terrific Tuesdays\" and \"Wonderfu l W ednesdays.\" In response to the popularity of garden -grown foods, C4C installed four school gardens at partner school sites under a grant from AHGL. C4C held 446 health promotion events through the course of the year, in the categoriesCommunity Gardens, Exercise/Spor ts, Health Education, and Nutrition Education. Direct education classes consist of AHGL staff conducting nutrition education classes to members o f t he community; Some topics include reading food labels, choosing foods from all the food groups, reducing sugar and sodium, and increasing water consumption; These classes were heldat community centers, elementary schools, Head Start sites, and homeless shelters FromFebruary through August each year, C4C conducted 26 Zumba classes in Pacific CommunityCenter and Park in Glendale, every Thursday, free of charge. Over three years, the class grewfrom 10 to 50 participants. C4C participated in annual community events, giving information about the Champions fo r C hange program and its benefits at the Cesar Chavez Festival, Glendale Fire Pancake Breakfast, Glendale Cruise Night, Edison Elementary School Carnival, Edison Elementary Back to Schoo l N ight, and After School Sports Championship Events at Thomas Edison Elementary School, Pacific Clinics -Head Start Lexington, and Pacific Clinics -Head Start Glendale. C4C is funded by the California Department of Public Health Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Branch (NEOPB). Chronic Disease Response 2: Building infrastructure to address chronic disease has included establishing 10 FQHCs and conducting the annual We Own The Health Of Our Community health summit. Chronic Disease Response 3: Homeless care and mental health care emerged as intersecting priority needs in 2016 -2018. Homeless care: Working with the City of Glendale, which invests $2.3 mil/year into homeless care, AHGL was awarded HEAP funding to hire a homeless care coordinator who works in conjunction withGlendale Homeless Coalition and ACCESS center. Mental health care: AHGL is coaching 16 primary care practices to provide depression screeningand referral.

Short -term evaluation indicators included an increase in the proportion of adults in the service area who receive screenings for cancer, and an increase in the proportion of adults in the service area who receive appropriate care once diagnosed for cancer. Cancer Care Response 1: The need was identified to i mprove access to cancer screenings and services among community residents. Adventist Health Glendale (AHGL) is part of an elite group of facilities across the country raising the standard of care for every patient. We are proud to be recognized by Hologic as a Pink Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 21 Ribbon Facility. As a Pink Ribbon Facility, we take pride in providing every woman that comes to us for a mammogram with a digital mammography exam. Digital mammography offers a number of practical advantages and patient conveniences. Because the re is no waiting for film to be developed it significantly reduces the need for repeat exams due to under or over exposure. Digital images are easily stored and transferred electronically, eliminating the dependency on one set of original films, which can be misfiled or lost in transit. Cancer Care Response 2: In 2017, AHGL introduced a new lung cancer screening program and technology designed to offer health care providers a faster pathway to lung cancer detection and treatment. Like all cancers, the key to lung cancer survival is early detection. In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that screening with low -dose computed tomography (CT) reduced lung cancer deaths among a population of heavy smokers by 20 percent, when compared to using chest X -rays as the diagnostic tool. Adventist Health Glendale has long been at the forefront of offering programs and cutting -edge technology for early detection of a wide range of conditions. The adoption of DynaLync and DynaCAD Lung software from Inviv o Corporation provides critical tools to aid with the identification, tracking, and management of relevant information to help the AHGL team reach a quick, definitive diagnosis. Clayton Lau, director of imaging at Adventist Health Glendale explained, \"Adve ntist Health Glendale is in a unique position to be able to offer not only the advanced imaging technology to make early lung cancer detection possible, but the data insights, collaboration and tools that are needed to deliver the quality and consistency required for health systems to succeed in new, evidence -based models of patient care.\" Cancer Care Response 3: Cancer patients and survivors had access to the following services: The Positive Image Center distributed wigs, cuts, scarves and caps, blankets, and the Cancer Center offered Prostate and Skin Cancer Screenings at Community Outreach and Fairs and Events, serving 3,400. AHGL's Brain Tumor Support Group is open to individuals and their families with primary brain tumors or brain metastases. The g roup meets the third Wednesday of each month from 6:00PM to 7:30PM in the Cancer Center Conference Room. The group is free and light refreshments are served. All cancer survivorship services are community -supported and offered free to any cancer survivor/ patient in Glendale, regardless of where they received treatment. Our survivorship programs include: o Ingeborg's Place Apart - Ingeborg's provides a warm, non -clinical environment to help people re -energize and feel 100% supported as they battle a cancer d iagnosis. o Focus on Healing - Provides free access to individual counseling and support groups for any cancer survivor and their loved ones. o Cancer fitness classes - These exercise classes are designed specially for cancer patients. o Nurse navigator - The AHGL oncology nurse navigator helps patients find doctors, make appointments, provides guidance and simply anticipates patient and family needs to improve services received throughout the entire cancer treatment process. Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 22 oPatient Education and Resource Ce nter - At the AHGL Cancer Center, we want people to know that they are not alone and that their search for the best treatment can stop a t A HGL. oW rite to Heal - A special workshop designed to help cancer patients cope with th e d iagnosis of cancer. oJewelry -Making - A therapeutic class designed to help cancer patients cope with the ir d iagnosis through art and creativity. For improving access to cancer education, detection, and treatment services, AHGL has received the following Cancer Care Awards: AHGL is accredited by the American College of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer as a CommunityHospital Comprehensive Cancer Program. This accreditation is given to facilities who meet therequirements for patient- centered care and focus on improving quality and pati ent outcomes. Adventist Health Glendale's Cancer Center is designated a Pink Ribbon Facility by Hologic.

Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 27 Glassell Park had a male population only slightly greater than 50.0% of the total, and two Glendale ZIP codes (91206 and 91207) and Montrose had male populations notably below 50.0% of the total and notably below the service area average (47. 1%, 46.8% , and 47.0% respectively ). Age Population by Age in Los Angeles County The population within the broader Service Planning Areas of AHGL comprises primarily of adults (63.2% and 62.1% respectively). In comparison with Los Angeles C ounty, the youth age distribution skews slightly lower, and the more densely populated SPA 4 has the most seniors in the entire Los Angeles County. Data Source: California Health Interview Survey, 2017, SPA *= statistically unstable This same pattern holds true within the specific communities that AHGL serves. Most of the population ranges betw een the ages of 25 and 64 (5 6.6%), with Glendale (ZIP Codes 91203 and 91204) topping the service area range. In contrast with Los Angeles Count y, the AHGL service area skews towards an older population with sen iors proportionately higher ( 17.6%) and youth significantly lower (18. 0%) even though Highland Park had a younger population (23.3 % below the age of 18, respectiv ely) compared to Los Angele s County's 22.2 % rate.

The Black/African -American population in the AHGL service area ( 1.7%) was less than one quarter that of Los Angeles County (8.5 %). The Asian popu lation in the service area (1 5.9%) was slightly higher than in Los Angeles County (14.4 %). The AHGL service area consists of geographically concentrated ethnic communities that contribute to the area's vibrancy and community -based assets.

K EY FINDINGS: HEALTH NEEDS Adventist Health Glendale 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 40 HEALTH NEED PRIORITY 1: POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS Poverty Poverty creates barriers to everyday necessities, including healthy and affordable foods, health care, housing, and other basic needs. Collectively, these barriers impact overall health and well- being. P overty Thresholds The federal government measures the numb er of people in poverty with thresholds (aka Federal Poverty Level) established and updated by the U.S. C ensus. In 2017, the Federal Poverty Level for an individual stood at annual income of $12,060 while for a family of four it was $24,600. In California, where the cost of living is high, research indicates that families can earn two or more times the Federal Poverty Level and still struggle to meet their basic needs. 16 A comprehensive 2018 state- by-state report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) demonstrated that renting a two -bedroom apartment in Los Angeles required a household income of $66,520.17 The AHGL service area falls within larger geographic Service Planning Areas that differ in their overall poverty profile. Though the county's highest rates of poverty are in SPA 6 and SPA 1 , as described in the chart below, the densely populated SPA 4 has a larger percentage of the population living below FPL than both the neighboring SPA 2 and the entire county: one in four households in SPA 4 were estimated to live below 100% FPL. Youth in the county are similarly impacted with 27.4% living below 100% FPL compare d to the state's rate of 21.0%. In 2017, according to the U.S. Census, 40.6% of Los Angeles County families living below 100% FPL with children under 18 , where the head of household was female lived , was in line with the s tate's rate of 39.5%.

This income level indicates high risk for food insecurity and qualifies a person for public assistance programs. Yet, it appears that the proportion of eligible residents accessing this resource is much lower. Reasons cited for low access rates include complex application processes, inaccessible case managers, inaccurate records, and bureaucratic bottlenecks, e.g., declined eligibility due to change of address, etc. The percentage of L.A. County residents who used food stamps was 21.7% and TANF/CalWorks was 9.9%. A little over half (52.7%) of qualifying children had access to WIC.

A larger portion of students in Los Angeles County are eligible for this program than students across the state as a whole. In 2017, the percentage of children eligible for the Free or Reduced -Price School Meal (FRPM) program in L.A. County was 69.3% compared with the California rate of 60.1%. The county rate has been increasing with growth from 61.8% in 2011 to 66.6% in 2015. 20 Household Income L.A. County is home to approximately 3.4 million households of varying income levels. T he AHGL service area represents 5.5% of all households in the county. The geographic areas follow a similar bimodal distribution in income levels --- one in ten households subsist on less than $15,000 per year, while more than three of ten earn incomes grea ter than $100,000 and the majority of households earned between $35,000 and $75,000 dollars. The AHGL area, however, has a greater proportion of households in the $15,000- $24,000 by a margin of 1.4%. Also, L.A. County has a slightly higher income distribut ion among households with earnings above $100,000 by a 1.2% margin, suggesting perhaps that AHGL -area households were moderately less wealthy than L.A.

If they are escaping domestic violence and do not have a second residence or support network.\" 21 More than 20 percent of the nation's homeless population is now living in California. Based on U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates, as of January 2018, an estimated 129, 972 people in California experienced homelessness on any given day. Among them, 6.18% or 6,702 were family households, 8.3% or 10,836 were Veterans, 9.5% or 12,396 were unaccompanied young adults (aged 18 -24), and 26.4% or 34,332 were individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. Furthermore, \"public school data reported to the U.S. Department of Education during the 2016 -2017 school year shows that an estimated 246,296 public school students experienced homelessness.

Some steps have already been taken in Los Angeles, such as the county's Measure H sales tax, which will add about $460 million this year to the budget.27 Investments have been made for additional housing, with approximately 1,400 units to open this year, and over 10,000 housing units planned to be built.28 Nevertheless, over 500,000 affordable housing units are needed in Los Angeles alone to meet the demand for low income renters.29 A minimum wage earner, at $13.25 needs to work at least 79 hours per week to afford a one bedroom apartment in Los Angeles.30 These statistics speak directly to an individual's monthly budget and availability of additional resources to handle his or her current and future medical needs. Hospitals and medical organizations cannot ignore the state of the housing and poverty crisis when plan ning to meet the health needs of their respective service areas. This crisis adversely im pacts the affordability of care .

Families and individuals are much more likely to become unstably housed or homeless if they are shouldering a high housing cost burden, typically defined as housing costs that exceed 30% of monthly income.

Exacerbating the challenges is the difficulties encountered in finding childcare , which presents obstacle for obtaining and maintaining employment. They noted having observed that the only consistent source of care for the homeless population is emergency (911) service, which puts a n undue financial burden on emergency service s and creates barriers to acces s for the larger population . Because the home less population lives disproportionately with mental health disorders , the reliance on emergency services fails to meet this long -term health care need. The high cost of living puts an undue burden on low -income families that spend a large proportion of th eir incomes on rent (vs. greater investment in healthy food or recreation). Poverty is expensive, both as a societal cost ($672 billion per year nationwide) and as a risk factor for stress, hunger, homelessness, and economic catastrophes both large and sma ll for vulnerable families.33 Stakeholders have also noted an increase in the homeless population and a lack of shelters. Homeless families face unique challenges in accessing education and health care, and there are insufficient social service providers in place to connect these families with homeless services. In focus groups, stakeholders noted as well that veterans comprise an ever -increasing proportion of the homeless population. An overall theme that emerged was the need to understand how address pover ty from a health care perspective . 33 Shriver Center on Poverty Law: https://theshriverbrief.org/the- high -cost-of-poverty -for-the-poor -and- for-us-all- 4b0afde5a88f Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 53 HEALTH NEED PRIORITY 2: MENTAL HEALTH & SUBSTANCE ABUSE Mental Health Mental illness increases risk factors for disability and lowers quality of life . Undiagnosed, untreated mental health disorders are linked to substance abuse, risk behavior s, and lack of a support network . Additionally, mental health disorders may seriously impact physical health and are associated with the prevalence, progression, and outcome of chronic diseases34 as well as a family history of mental illness, age, substance abuse, life -event stresses , and self- harm .35 Mental health is associated with many other health factors, including poverty, heavy alcohol consump - tion, and unemployment, and increases the morbidity of these conditions. Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity are also correlated with mental health disorders and outcomes such as depression and suicide. 36 Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to higher rates of disordered mental health and risk behaviors.37 AHGL stakeholders identified mental health disorders as one of the top health concerns in their service area, adding that it affects everyone, regardless of age. There is a feedback loop between integrating mental health resources with primary care for a more cohesive service delivery model and improved patient outcomes . Stakeholders emphasized a need for the prevention of mental health episodes , which can be as destructive as (and can cause) economic catastrophe .

Among adolescents, family, social networks, and peer pressure are key influencers of substance use. 44 Additional downstream health risks of disordered substance use include teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, STDs, domestic violence, child abuse, motor vehicle accidents (unintentional injuries), physical fights, crime, homicide, and suicide. 45 In two -thirds of cases, disordered substance use can be linked to adverse childhood experiences. 46 Alcohol Use Disorder Heavy alcohol consumption is an important determinant of future health needs, includ ing cirrhosis, cancers, and untreated mental and beh avioral health needs. A community's density of alcohol outlets is associated with heavy drinking, drinking and driving, higher rates of motor vehicle -related pedestrian injuries, child abuse and neglect, and other violence.47 In 2016, the average number of alcohol outlets per 1,000 persons in the AHGL service area was 1.4.

In addition, cigar smoking may cause cancer of the larynx, mouth, esophagus, and lung.52 E-cigarettes represent an em erging threat to public health. E -cigarette use, called vaping, has targeted children with candy and fruit flavors. The use of e -cigarettes is unsafe for kids, teens, and young adults. Nicotine is highly addictive and can harm adolescent brain development, which continues into the early to mid -20s.53 Tobacco use is perhaps the most preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Each year, approximately 443,000 Americans die from tobacco -related illnesses. For every person who dies from tobacco use, 20 more suffer with at least one serious tobacco -related illness. In addition, tobacco use costs the U.S. $193 billion annually in direct medical expenses and lost productivity.54 The percent of self- reported smoking varies between SPA 2 (7.6%) and SPA 4 (11.5%) with the County of Los Angeles reporting 9% of the adult population as current smokers.

HEALTH NEED PRIORITY 3: ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE Access to Medical Care Access to health care services is important for everyone's quality of life , which requires the ability to navigate the health care system, access a health care location where needed services are provided, and a health care provider the patient can communicate with and trust. 55 Access to health care impacts overall physical, social, and mental health status, the prevention of disease and disability, the detection and treatment of health conditions, quality of life, preventable death, and life expectancy for individuals. 56 In California, Los Angeles County is ranked 45 among 57 counti es in the most recent statewide county rankings for health access.57 Health Insurance Coverage The AHGL service area falls within Service Planning Areas 2 and 4 where the population of insured was slightly below the county and state rates.

In fact, based on data from the California Health Interview Survey (2017), over half (59.2%) of California residents have a doctor's office/HMO or Kaiser Permanente as their source of medical care ; the rate among Los Angeles residents is 5% lower. More so than California residents (25.7%), approximately 28% of L.A. County residents visit a community clinic, government clinic or community hospital. Another 2.4% rely on emergency room or urgent care. Still, a significant proportion of L.A. County residents have no source of care at all (15.1%). Los Angeles County trails the rest of California in residents who have a regular source of care. In service planning areas of Los A ngeles County that include AHGL 's service area, rate of residents with a regular source to primary care is lower than both Los Angeles County (84.9%) and the State (87%). 61 The AHGL service area rate (79.5%) trended even lower in 2015. Larger differences e merge within the population itself as well. Los Angeles County residents appear to lag their counterparts in California in source of care. Regardless of age group, the percentage of residents who had a consistent source of care was higher in California than all of Los Angeles County.

Lack of a Consistent Source of Primary Care among Adult Population Subpopulation Disparities to Access Without access to primary care providers and other preventive care services, individuals and families would rely more heavily on h ospitalizations and emergency care, both of which are more costly. By looking at not only the rates of access to regular sources of care but also the dispa rities in these rates, hospitals and health care organizations may identify subpopulations in greater need and develop culturally sensitive strategies in their outreach programs. Populations that are ethnically American Indian /Alaskan Native, Black, and White appeared to have the highest access rates to usual care, at 95.3%, 94.1%, and 90.6% respectively.

According to the American College of Cardiology, \"coronary events, in the United States in 2019, are expected to occur in about 1,055,000 individuals, including 720,000 new and 335,000 recurrent coronary events. \"63 In addition to being one of the leading causes of death in the United States, heart disease results in serious illness and disability, decreased quality of life, and hundreds of billions of dollars in economic loss every year. 64 Cardiovascular disease encompasses and/or is closely linked to a number of health conditions that include arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, cardiac arrest, cardiac rehab, cardiomyopathy, cardiovascular conditions in childhood, high cholesterol, congenital h eart defects, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, high blood pressure, HIV, heavy alcohol consumption, metabolic syndrome, obesity, pericarditis, periph - eral artery disease (PAD), and stroke.65 The leading risk factors for heart disease are high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, poor diet, physical inactivity, and overweight and obesity. The toxic stress of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is linked to cardiovascular disease and related risk behaviors.66 Cardiovascular diseas e is closely linked with and can often lead to stroke. Prevalence and Management In Los Angeles County, the rate of adults diagnosed with heart disease has increased moderately each year, from 5.4% in 2015 to 5.6% in 2016 and 6.6% in 2017. This trend is m ore pronounced in Service Planning Area 4, Metro, where the diagnosis rate in 2015 was 2.6%, and the change in rate was +3.8% in 2016, and an additional +0.5% in 2017. Within the c ounty, White populations had a nearly one in 10 rate of heart disease (9.5%) , with comparable rates among Black populations (8.2%) and lower rates for Latino (5.6%) and Asian populations (2.8%). A large percentage of the population in SPA 2 -San Fernando (94.7%) received assistance from a care provider to manage their disease. The rate is higher than that in Los Angeles County by an 18% margin. Among diagnosed adults managing their condition, more than half in the county (53.5%) were confident they could control their condition. Approximately 94.5% in SPA 4 - Metro were either confident or 63 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics -2019 Update: A Report From the American Heart Association. Circulation 2019;Jan 31.

Age is a contributing factor; as people get older, cholesterol level tends to rise. Diabetes can also lead to the development of high cholesterol. Some behaviors can also lead to high cholesterol, including a diet high in saturated fats, trans -fatty acids (trans fats), dietary cholesterol, or triglycerides. Being overweight and/or physically inactive can also contribute to high cholesterol. A quarter (25.2%) of the population in the AHGL service area were diagnosed with high cholesterol. Among individuals with cholesterol, two thirds (66.8%) in the AHGL service area received disease Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 76 management services for their condition.

Smoking, obesity, the regular consumption of salt and fat, excessive drinking, and physical inactivity are risk factors for hypertensi on. People who have previously had a stroke, have high cholesterol, or have heart or kidney disease are also at higher risk of developing hypertension. The populations in Service Planning Areas 2 and 4 are slightly less prone to hypertension (29.9% and 24.4%) than in Los Angeles County overall (30.0%). In these SPAs, more than seven out of ten with high blood pressure took medication to control their high blood pressure, while in the county , a larger proportion of the population managed the condition with medication (72.6%).

As early as age 25, at least 11.8% of people suffered high cholesterol. That rate and their risk for cardiovascular disease more than double by the time they reached 40 -49 and tripled at 50 -59 years of age.

G ood health practices include access to mental and medical care and timely physical and medical tests. Adequate, regular primary care can prevent the devel opment of health problems and maintain positive health conditions. Preventive wellness also includes a healthy diet, activity level, sleep, and stress management, all of which have profound effects on our physical health. Health care providers can make a significant contribution to preventive wellness through trauma informed care. 68 Medical Prevention: Health Check -Ups As examined in greater detail in Module 5 of this report, medical access and continuity of care help to treat a medical condition before complications and medical costs multiply. An annual check -up is the first step towards proactively preventing and managing health conditions. As shown i n the chart below, the rate at which Los Angeles County residents visited a doctor, nurse , or other health care professional within one year was 70.7%, which suggests that 29.3%, or nearly a third of the population, did not receive such care. In SPA 2 -San Fernando Valley, 74.3% of the population visited a doctor, nurse , or other health professional; this rate was slightly better than the county rate. The percentage of residents in the AHGL service area who visit ed a doctor, nurse, or other health care professional was about the same (70.1%) as the county rate. Conversely, a higher percentage of individuals residing in the AHGL service area visited a dentist or a dental clinic (62.8%) than in Los Angeles County as a whole (59.3%). The gap in care between medical and dental is significant, with fewer residents in L.A. County and AHGL service area accessing dental care.

When Disneyland faced a measles outbreak in 2014, the California legislature took action and eliminated exemptions base d on religious or personal beliefs that allowed children to skip their immunizations to attend public school. Since that time, immunizations for children ha ve trended higher such that 95% of children in Los Angeles County met all required immunizations for the 2017 -2018 school year.69 Influenza and pneumonia have been a top ten leading cause of death in Los Angeles County with an age adjusted death rate of 22.3 per 100,000 persons compared to the California rate of 16.3 per 100,000 persons. 70 Even though over 2,125 people died from influenza and pneumonia , a benchmark for this cause of death was not identified in the Healthy People 2020 Objective. Within the County population, seniors and youth under 18 receive the highest rates of vaccination --- the senior flu vaccination rate moderately trails the state (69.3%), and children's flu vaccination rate is significantly higher than the state by +4.8%. In addition, fewer pneumonia vaccinations (62.0%) are administered among seniors than flu vaccinations, th ough higher vaccination rates in Service Planning Area 2 and 4 means that nearly two -thirds of the senior population are vaccinated.

Although not all such hospitalizations can be avoided, admission rates in populations and communities can vary depending on access to primary care, care -seeking behaviors, and the quality of care available. Because hospitalization tends to be costlier than outpatient or primary care, potentially preventable hospitalizations often are tracked as markers of health system 69 California Department of Public Health. https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/2017- 2018KindergartenSummaryReport.pdf Accessed [May 26,2019] 70 Source: California Department of Public Health, Center for Health Statistics and Informatics, 2015 County Health Status Profiles, 2015, County .

Cardiovascular disease is closely linked with and can often lead to stroke. Generally, stroke can cause five types of disabilities: paralysis or problems controlling movement; sensory disturbances including pain; problems using or understanding language; problems with thinking and memory; and emotional disturbances.75 You c an't control some stroke risk factors, like heredity, age, gender, and ethnicity. Some medical conditions \u2014including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, overweight or obesity, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA )\u2014can also raise your stroke risk. Avoiding smoking and drinking too much alcohol, eating a balanced diet, and getting exercise are all choices you can make to reduce your risk.76 The leading risk factors for heart disease are high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, poor diet, physical inactivity, and overweight and obesity. The toxic stress of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is linked to cardiovascular disease , stroke, and related risk behaviors. 77 People who have previously had a str oke, have high cholesterol, or have heart or kidney disease are also at higher risk of developing hypertension. In addition, oral health conditions such as periodontal (gum) disease have been linked to heart disease and stroke, as well as diabetes and prem ature, low -weight births. 78 Improvement in cardiovascular health and quality of life is achieved through prevention, detection and treatment of risk factors for heart attack and stroke, early identification and treatment of heart attacks and strokes, and p revention of repeat cardiovascular events. Strategies include stroke risk assessment activities , such as increasing the proportion of adults who have had their blood pressure measured within the preceding two years , and access to stroke support groups , stroke awareness, and clinical services. Prevalence According to the Centers for Disease Control, s omeone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds. Every four minutes, someone dies of stroke. Every year, about 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke. About 610,000 of these are first or new strokes; 185,000 are recurrent strokes. Stroke is an important cause of disability. Stroke reduces mobility in more than half of stroke survivors age 65 and over. Stroke costs the nation $34 billion annually, including the cost of health care services, medications, and lost productivity. Between 2000 and 2010, the relative rate of stroke deaths dropped by 35.8% in the United States. However, each year stroke affects nearly 800 000 individuals, with many survivors experiencing 75 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding. Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes. Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination. Sudden severe headache with no known cause. Ongoing Medical Care Associated with Stroke According to a study by the American Stroke Association80 in collaboration with other stroke institutes, examples for need of skilled nursing services include (but are not limited to) the following: Bowel and bladder impairment , skin breakdown or high risk for skin breakdown , impaired bed mobility , dependence for activities of daily living (ADLs) , inability to manage medications , and h igh risk for nutritional deficits . Examples for need of regular contact by a physician include (but are not limited to) the following: Medical comorbidities not optimally managed (e .g., diabetes mellitus and hypertension) , complex rehabilitation issues (e .g., orthotics, spasticit y, and bowel/bladder) , acute illness (but not severe enough to prevent rehabilitation care) , and p ain management issues Examples for need of multiple therapeutic interventions include (but are not limited to) the following: Moderate to severe motor/senso ry deficits, and/or c ognitive deficits, and/or c ommunication deficits .

ASA says that 1 in 3 ischemic strokes has an unknown cause. Collaboration by neurologists, cardiologists, electrophysiologists and other in tegral team members may reveal the answers needed to provide targeted treatment for preventing recurrent strokes. Stroke rehabilitation requires a sustained and coordinated effort from a large team, including the patient and his or her goals, family and friends, other caregivers (e .g., personal care attendants), physicians, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, speech -language pathologists, recreation therapists, psychologists, nutritionists, social workers, and others.

In addition, cigar smok ing may cause cancer of the larynx, mouth, esophagus, and lung. 85 Findings suggest that obesity increases the risks for cancers of the esophagus, breast (postmenopausal), endometrium, colon and rectum, kidney, pancreas, thyroid, gallbladder, and more .86 Heav y alcohol consumption is an important determinant of future cirrhosis and cancers . Cancer prevention strategies include an increase in the proportion of adults in the service area who receive screenings for cancer, and an increase in the proportion of adu lts in the service area who receive appropriate care once diagnosed for cancer. Prevalence Between 1991 and 2015, the overall rate of death by cancer in the United States fell by 26%. This is attributed to an increase in screenings to detect cancers at a t reatable stage and a decline in smoking, which is a leading cause of cancer. However, the U.S. population is aging, and age is a cause of cancer, as is obesity, which is also on the rise. According to the National Cancer Institute, approximately 38.4% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes (based on 2013 -2015 data). The most common cancers (listed in descending order according to estimated new cases in 2018) are breast cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, prostate cancer, colon and rectum cancer, melanoma of the skin, bladder cancer, non - Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney and renal pelvis cancer, endometrial cancer, leukemia, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, and liver cancer. Cancer mortality is higher among men than women (196.8 per 100,000 men and 139.6 per 100,000 women). When comparing groups based on race/ethnicity and sex, cancer mortality is highest in African American men (239.9 per 100,000) and lowest in Asian/Pacific Islander women (88.3 per 100,000). Estimated national expenditures for cancer care in the United States in 2017 were $147.3 billion. In future years, costs are likely to increase as the population ages and cancer 83 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.

Costs are also likely to increase as new, and often more expensive, treatments are adopted as standards of care.87 Cancer Screenings With new technological developments, different forms of cancer screenings have been gaining traction. The colorectal cancer screening was benchmarked at 70.5% in the Healthy 2020 Objective, and more benchmarks will likely emerge as new screening tests become standard practice. However, statistical measurements in this area appear to not be publicly available with only a 2008 -2010 model estimate available for Los Angeles County that measured the rate at which patients of any ethnicity over 50 years of age had a colorectal endoscopy or took a home -based fecal occult blood test over a two year period or over. This rate was 55.1% for the County while a more recent figure for California was had the screening rate at 75.9%.88 Cancer Screenings and Women's Health In women's health, gendered cancer screenings have become standard practice. Mammogram screenings among women 30 years and older over a two -year period were moderately higher in Lo s Angeles County (78.2%) than the state (76.1%). The county rate had increased by a 17% margin from 5 years earlier, but failed to meet the 81.1% benchmark set in Healthy People 2020 Objective. A breakdown by Service Planning Area offered a mixed picture w ith Service Planning Area 2 having a rate (85.6%) close to the highest rated SPA, while Service Planning 4 was, in fact, the lowest rated SPA in the County.

Radiation therapy: Radiation ther apy is a type of cancer treatment that uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy is a type of treatment t hat helps your immune system fight cancer. Targeted therapy: Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment that targets the changes in cancer cells that help them grow, divide, and spread. Hormone therapy: Hormone therapy is a treatment that slows or stop s the growth of breast and prostate cancers that use hormones to grow. Stem cell transplant: Stem cell transplants are procedures that restore blood -forming stem cells in cancer patients who have had theirs destroyed by very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Precision medicine: Precision medicine helps doctors select treatments that are most likely to help patients based on a genetic understanding of their disease. Coping with Cancer and Cancer Treatments According to the National Cancer Inst itute, the symptoms and side effects of cancer and its treatment may cause certain physical changes, but they can also affect the way you feel and how you live. 90 This can include feeling o verwhelmed , denial, a nger , fear and w orry, stress and anxiety , sadne ss and depression , guilt, and l oneliness - and also, hope and gratitude . Physical side effects of cancer treatment can include nausea and vomiting, fatigue, cognitive impairment and delirium, pain, gastrointestinal complications, hot flashes and night sweats, and sleeping disorders. Cancer patients commonly f eel they have to b e strong and protect their friends and families , seek support and turn to loved ones or other cancer survivors , ask for help from counselors or other professionals , and/or t urn to their faith to help them cope . According to the National Comprehensive Canc er Network, sharing about their experience in a support group setting helps individuals understand that others like them are trying to work through the same experiences . Different types of cancer support groups make it possible for a patient or caregiver to find a resource that meets their needs91, including: 89 National Cancer Institute.

Alternati vely, for some, attending meetings with a partner can strengthen that bond and demonstrate how a commitment to working together can be an added comfort. Meeting with other couples can also be an opportunity to discuss topics common to many partners living with cancer, including frustration and fear of loss. Spouse or Caregiver. Similarly, a forum where caregivers can discuss their challenges can also be very helpful and effective. Caring about and/or for a cancer patient can be an exhausting and emotionally taxing experience on several levels. Coping and support strategies are often exchanged. Children. Faced with an uncertain future, children often will appreciate a place where they can open up and share their concerns and fears. Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 92 HEALTH NEED PRIORITY 8: GERIATRIC SUPPORT Geriatric Support Hospitals are shouldering the complex care needs of a growing number of geriatric patients. Older adults are one of the fastest - growing cohorts of the nation's population. By 2030, over 20% of the U.S. population will be comprised of people 65 and over.92 The fastest- growing segment of our population, by age, are adults over 85.93 Older adults have special healthcare needs that can make their medical care more complicated. More than half of adults age 65 and older have three or more medical problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and high blood pressure. 94 Geriatric care requires a team approach to address the medical, social, emotional, and other needs of the patient, with the close involvement of family members and other ca regivers. Some of the health concerns common among older adults include incontinence, vision and hearing loss, memory loss, bone density loss, falls, and managing multiple chronic conditions and medications. To maintain good health and reduce risk of disease and disability, seniors 65 and over are advised to engage in exercise, maintain good nutrition, receive regular health screenings, vaccinate , get enough sleep, and participate in activities o f interest. Aging Indicators As a percent of the total population, the AHGL service area has a larger population of adults over 65 ( 16.3% ) compared to the Los Angeles County average (13.5%) . In these areas, including Glendale ZIP codes 91206 (19.2% 65 years of age or older), 91207 (21.9% 65 years of age or older) and 91208 (19.2% 65 years of age or older), nearly one in five residents was 65+ years old. Within Los Angeles County, the populat ion 65 years of age or older was distinct from the entire resident population in a few notable ways. The 65+ population report ed very reduced rates of binge drinking (4.2% vs. 15.9%). The 65+ population report ed an easier time obtaining medical care when n eeded (only 9.3% reported this is somewhat or very difficult, compared to 23.6% of the entire population). Additionally, 66.6% of the 65+ population reported seeing a dentist or visiting a dental clinic in the past year, compared with 59.3% of the Los Ange les County resident population. 92 United States Census: An Aging Population: https:// 2019]. 2 out of 5 seniors (65+) have a disability 31% of seniors (65+) reported fair to poor health status Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 93 However, when compared to the Los Angeles County resident population, specific needs among the 65+ population emerge. For example, a larger percentage of the 65+ population were diagnosed with diabetes (21.2%), hypertension (54.2%) or high cholesterol (47.5%) than the Los Angeles County population in general (9.8%, 23.5% and 25.2%, respectively). Additionally, 47.7% of the 65+ population reported low or no physical activity, compared with 34.8% of the general population. Mort ality due to Alzheimer's disease remained an area of high concern for California. While Santa Clara appeared to improve with respect to its Alzheimer's disease death rate, this improvement is actually due to reporting inconsistencies by this county. Even after accounting for this large artificial decrease, California still demonstrated a 16.3 percent increase in the rate of Alzheimer's deaths compared to the prior 2012- 2014 three -year rate, which resulted in a current mortality rate of 35.7 per 100,000. Wit h the exception of Santa Clara County, seven out of California's 10 most populous counties showed an Alzheimer's death rate increase of over 20 percent from the prior period. See technical notes and Table 8 for more information regarding Alzheimer's diseas e. The chart on the next page is a compilation of these and other data values available for the 65 and over subpopulation. Many of these indicators have already been covered in other modules of this report. But, given that American population is aging as the Baby Boomer generation reaches retirement age, it is important to consider how these indicators change over time in the next several years. These values present a benchmark from which further trends may be analyzed. A Closer Look at Falls The rate of elderly hospitalized due to falls is roughly 28% in both Los Angeles County and California. Comparatively, seniors in Service Planning Area 2 and 4 had significantly fewer falls. The AHGL service area showed a lower percentage of elderly hospitalized from falls (17.8%) than both Los Angeles County (28.0%) and California (28.5%). Among fall victims within a given year, close to one in three changed their daily routine. The Service Planning Areas of interest to AHGL saw a similar proportion of se niors changing their routine. Differences among SPAs were marginal (less than 3%). Typically , eight out of 10 physicians in California recommend physical therapy or activity after a fall. In the AHGL service area, fewer physicians/professionals recommended physical therapy or exercise due to falls (76.9%) in comparison to Los Angeles County (83.9%) and California (80.4%). SPA 4 -Metro had the lowest percentage (69.8%) of physicians recommending physical therapy out of all reported areas in the chart below. After a fall, a third of physicians in California reviewed seniors' medications, a rate that was significantly lower than Los Angeles County and Service Planning Area 4. Furthermore , the AHGL service area (35 .9%) was significantly lower than Los Angeles County (40.2%) but moderately higher than California (33.7%).

They also added that outreach regarding available community resources and family -based interventio n is important, especially among Black and Latino subpopulations. Care providers expressed that prevention and maintenance education, as well as expanded access to preventive and maintenance care, would support the communities most impacted by diabetes. This appears to have changed. In 2019, diabetes was not rated by local stakeholders as a top priority issue affecting the AHGL service area. While diabetes affects an estimated 30.3 million people in the United States , it appears the condition is more prevalent East of the Mississippi, as indicated in a CDC report. 95 As the seventh leading cause of death in California, death from diabetes is only a fraction of the leading cause of death statewide -- coronary heart disease was 5.5 times deadlier. Diabetes lowers life expectancy by up to 15 years, increases the risk of heart disease by two to four times, and is the leading cause of kidney failure, lower- limb amputations, and adult - onset blindness. 96 In Los Angeles County, the age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 persons is 2,190.3 for diabetes, while for coronary heart disease is 11,824.7, followed by stroke which has a rate of 3,310.97 Diabetes diagnosis can also indicate an unhealthy lifestyle \u2014a risk factor for further health issues \u2014and is also linked to obesity. Factors associated with diabetes include overweight; high blood pressure or high cholesterol, high blood sugar (or glucose); physical inactivity ; smoking ; and, unhealthy eating. Other factors include age, race, gender, and having a family history of diabetes.98 Research suggests that diabetes is associated with other co -morbidities, including cognitive impairment, incontinence, fracture risk, and cancer risk and prognosis.99 The steady rise in the number of people with diabetes, and the earlier onset of Type 2 diabetes , raises concerns about growing diabetes -related complications , as well as the risk of further overwhelming the health care system. Recent discoveries about the individual and societal benefits of improved diabetes management and prevention may help curb some of these reverberating effects and bring life -saving 95 National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2017, Estimates of Diabetes and its B urden on the United States.

In addition, prevention at the primary care level among those at risk for developing diabetes would complement these efforts.100 Obesity / Overweight Obesity, a condition closely linked with diabetes, in which a person has a high proportion of body fat (BMI over 30), has risen to epidemic levels in the United States. Nearly 70% of adults age 20 years and older are overweight or obese.101 Excess weight is linked to impaired health outcomes as well as risk behaviors that impact health in other ways. In the U.S., 33.9% of adults are obese; The Healthy People 2020 goal brings obesity rates below or equal to 30.5%.102 Obesity reduces life expectancy and increases the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. Findings suggest that obesity also increases the risks for cancers of the esophagus, breast (postmenopausal), endometrium, colon and rectum, kidney, pancreas, thyroid, gallbladder, and more . 103 Researchers have found a strong graded relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), obesity, and risk behaviors that contribute to obesity.104 Obesity prevention is associated with healthier food access, healthcare access, and access to grocery stores, parks, and open space. Obesity is exacerbated by food insecurity and nutritional deficits, in particular iron deficiency. Prevalence of Obesity and Overweight Data trends for the adult population revealed a decrease in the rate of overweight pe ople between 2015 and 2017 in L.A. County by 4.6% and California by 2.3%. The rate remained unchanged for obese adults in L.A. County, while the California rate also decreased by 5.7%. Within Service Planning Areas of interest to the AHGL, the drop in the adult overweight rate was higher: -5.8% change in SPA 2 to 32.6% and -10.3% in SPA 4 to 31.2%. By contrast, obesity increased in SPA 2 by 2.5% to 27.5% in 2017, and in SPA 4 by 6.3% to 28.7%. This may suggest that those who are obese face barriers to losing weight.

However, in Los Angeles County, the rate was 11.4% in 2017 which is an increase of 12.5% over the same longitudinal period. SPA 2 and SPA 4 are home to a larger proportion of overweight children than the rates logged for LA County (11.4%) and 14.5% for California--- Service Planning Areas 2 and 4 saw rates of 14.2% and 17.8% respectively. Over a third of the adult population over 25 population in Los Angeles County was overweight and obes e. Rates by age: 65 years old and older (40.7%), age 40 to 49 (39.1%), age 30 to 39 (38.3%), age 60 to 64 (37.5%), age 50 to 59 years old (37.4%), and age 25 to 29 (31.3%).

Data Source: California Health Interview Survey, 2017, County Prevalence and Management of Diabetes The statistics offered in 2017 seem counterintuitive to the level of priority given to diabetes by AHGL stakeholders. Approximately 12% of adults in Los Angeles County are diagnosed with diabetes, a rate that has increased by 12% since 2015. The rate of adults diagnosed as pre -diabetic or borderline diabetic stood even higher, at 17.4%. This rate has increased by 24.3% since 2015 which seems to suggest that more people are at risk of being fully diabetic. The condition also appears to be more prevalent in the county than in California or the Service Planning Areas of interest to AHGL . In Service Planning Area 2, for instance, 9.6% are diabetic and 16.7% are pre to borderline diabetic.

In October 2015, health c are facilities began using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD- 10) for diagnosis and procedure coding of admissions and visits. Due to the increased specificity for diagnosis and procedure codes with ICD -10, please use caution when comparing prior time periods.

The highest rates were reported in Glassell Park: Zip Code 90065 (29.2 per 10,000) and Glendale: ZIP code 91204 (28.0). Furthermore, a frequency distribution reveals that rates of emergency use are higher than rates for hospitalization, suggesting that perhaps better diabetes management and education among adults may help reduce the need for costlier acute care services.
