The Role Vitamins Plan in Your Immune System Your body's immune system consists of many different parts, from the cells themselves to the chemicals and processes they use to fight off pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. The right vitamins can encourage an enhanced immune response. When your immune system has enough resources, it can work better, reducing your chances of getting sick and lessening the symptoms of certain illnesses. While it's best to get most of these [immune-boosting nutrients from food](https://ensosuperfoods.com/blogs/supergreens/best-immune-boosting-foods), getting every essential vitamin is not always possible, even if you have a diverse and healthy diet. Supplementing your diet with Ens Superfoods is an easy way to get the [perfect balance](https://ensosuperfoods.com/products/day-and-night) of nutrients for a strong immune system. What Vitamins Are Good for Immune System Maintenance? There are several vitamins, such as C and D, that boost immune function. Along with vitamins, there are many other essential nutrients that can help your immune system function optimally. 1. Vitamin C Vitamin C is one of the most common vitamins that support the immune system. It's a potent antioxidant that helps immune cells protect the body from pathogens and the damage caused by oxidative stress. According to one study, vitamin C has the potential to [shorten the duration of colds](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23440782/), particularly in children. While no vitamin can make the immune system invincible, vitamin C can help the body fight infections and improve immune health. - Origin: Citrus fruits, bell peppers, dark leafy greens - Superpower: Antioxidant, immune cell function - Key benefits: Vitamin C supports a healthy immune system in several ways. It helps the immune cells function properly and encourages cellular death, clearing old cells so new ones can replace them. Getting enough vitamin C can reduce the duration and severity of illnesses like the common cold. 2. Vitamin D Vitamin D emitted by the sun is essential for regulating immune function and activating immune cells. Vitamin D aids in the defense against infections and illnesses by supporting white blood cells, which respond to immune compromises. Vitamin D has also been shown to reduce inflammation and [protect against illnesses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3738984/) such as the flu and asthma. Meeting vitamin D requirements can help reduce the likelihood of contracting a respiratory infection or virus. Overall, vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins to include in your diet to improve immune function. - Origin: Fish, eggs, sunlight - Superpower: Decreases inflammation, supports white blood cells - Key benefits: Vitamin D supports white blood cells to help them fight off pathogens effectively. It also can decrease inflammation for a more effective immune response. Recent research shows that vitamin D may also protect against respiratory tract infections. 3. Vitamin E Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that protects the body's cells from oxidative damage. This fat-soluble vitamin promotes the optimal function of the [immune system's T-cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7011499/). Vitamin E can also aid in the prevention of chronic diseases and inflammation. While too much vitamin E can harm your health, getting the right amount can help your immune system defend against illnesses and cardiovascular disease. It's typically best to find vitamin E in whole foods opposed to supplements. - Origin: Nuts, spinach, seeds - Superpower: Antioxidant - Key benefits: This fat-soluble vitamin is a strong antioxidant that helps reduce free radicals, which can damage healthy cells. It can also lower the risk of clots in the arteries and heart and promote overall immune function. 4. B vitamins, especially B6 B vitamins are water-soluble vitamins that aid the body in various functions, including energy production, nerve function, and DNA synthesis. [Vitamins B6 and B12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019735/) particularly benefit the immune system, supporting infection-fighting agents such as T-cells. Vitamins B9 (folate) and B12 also aid in producing red blood cells and DNA synthesis, both of which are necessary for optimal immune function. Many adults are deficient in B vitamins, so making sure you get enough can help protect your immune system. - Origin: Chicken, salmon, green vegetables - Superpower: Support for enzyme functionality - Key benefits: There are 8 B vitamins, all of which help your body's enzymes function properly. Three complex B vitamins, B6, B9 (folate), and B12, are especially useful in reducing the risk of cancer and heart disease. Vitamin B6 also helps support the immune system's biochemical reactions. 5. Zinc Zinc is a mineral with numerous advantages, including immune function, wound healing, and cell growth. Zinc aids in the development and maintenance of immune cells, which protect the body from infections and illnesses. Zinc also has anti-inflammatory properties and can help protect the body from external toxins. According to one study, zinc-rich diets are more likely to protect against respiratory infections. Millions of adults, particularly older adults, are zinc deficient, so getting enough zinc in your diet is critical for optimal immune function. - Origin: Whole grains, dairy, meat, and nuts - Superpower: Immune cell development and communication - Key benefits: Zinc is a mineral that helps the immune system function properly by encouraging the development of immune cells. It also helps the cells communicate effectively and provides extra protection for the body's tissue barriers that are designed to stop pathogens from entering. 6. Elderberry Elderberry, or Sambucus nigra, is a dark purple fruit with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. For centuries, cultures have used the fruit to treat respiratory infections like colds and flu. Elderberry contains antibacterial properties that [protect against pathogens](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3056848/), making it an excellent addition to your diet. It's important to note that some people should take extra precautions when eating elderberries and consult with a doctor. Elderberry can cause nausea or vomiting when consumed raw, so ensure it's fully cooked before eating. - Origin: Fruit of the Sambucus plant - Superpower: Antiviral, anti-inflammatory - Key benefits: Elderberries have strong anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties that make them ideal for helping the immune system effectively fight off infections. Elderberry syrup is often recommended as a cold remedy, and it helps lower the swelling in mucus membranes. 7. Selenium Selenium is a mineral that aids in maintaining immune function and overall health. Selenium has antioxidant properties that protect cells in the body from oxidative stress caused by free radical damage. This mineral also helps in thyroid regulation, metabolism, and energy production. While more research is required, one animal study discovered that [selenium can boost antiviral defense](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30593352/) and protect against influenza strains. Given this information, selenium may be able to enhance the immune system and protect against certain illnesses. - Origin: Chemical element found in meat, fish, beans, and wheat - Superpower: Cell protection, DNA production - Key benefits: Just a small amount of selenium helps the body produce DNA and protects cells against infections and other damage. Selenium can also help with thyroid function and reduce the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. 8. Echinacea Echinacea is a flowering plant that can be used to treat a variety of ailments, including colds and flu. Echinacea may help the immune system by increasing the production of white blood cells and activating immune responses. The flower also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Echinacea can be prepared as a tea or found in capsule form, and it can be an effective way to boost the immune system. While more research is required, one study discovered that it can help [prevent respiratory virus infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4058675/). - Origin: Flowering plant - Superpower: Protection from colds, the flu - Key benefits: Echinacea has a long history as a dietary supplement, and some evidence suggests that it can reduce the chance of getting a cold. Additionally, it can be effective against the influenza virus and is often used in throat sprays to reduce sore throat symptoms. 9. Propolis Propolis is a resin-like substance collected by bees from tree buds. This substance is used by bees to protect their hives from bacteria and viruses, and it is possible that it has a similar effect on humans. Propolis has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and it has been used as medicine for centuries. While more human research is needed, preliminary evidence suggests that [propolis may boost the immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6335834/) and protect against viruses. It may also aid in the treatment of upper respiratory infections and reduce inflammation. - Origin: Resin from tree buds - Superpower: Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant - Key benefits: Propolis is another nutrient that can help reduce the duration of (and possibly prevent) upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold. It can enhance the immune system's natural function, and research shows that it may have antiviral properties. 10. Andrographis Andrographis is an Asian herb that can naturally treat illnesses such as fevers and respiratory infections. Because of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, andrographis has been used in Ayurvedic medicine. This herb contains terpenoid compounds, which [aid the immune system](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27896563/) in fighting viruses like influenza A. In addition to its immune-boosting properties, andrographis may help with pain relief and liver function. Because of these beneficial properties, it can help your immune system function optimally. - Origin: Flowering plant - Superpower: Antiviral - Key benefits: This herb contains andrographolide, which has antiviral properties. It can help protect your body from influenza and other viruses that cause respiratory diseases. It's also traditionally used as a fever reducer and painkiller, and it may shorten the duration of a cold when taken with Siberian ginseng. Why Immune System Maintenance is Key Many people never think about their immune system until they get sick. You might feel a tickle in your throat and rush to drink some orange juice or take a vitamin C supplement. While these \"emergency\" measures can sometimes reduce the length and severity of an illness, it's much better to keep your immune system in top shape all the time. In fact, [one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14671721/) showed that it is much less costly (in terms of physiological resources) to maintain the immune system compared to the energy cost of mounting a strong immune response. So what are the best ways to maintain your immune system? Getting lots of rest and plenty of water are two things that can keep your immune system in top shape. Numerous studies show a strong [link between nutrition and immune health](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/health-disease/immunity). Worldwide, the most common cause of immunodeficiency is malnutrition. On the other hand, a diet that provides enough nutrients for optimal cell health and functionality can significantly [ improve the immune system](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/nutrition-and-immunity/)'s response. An immune-boosting diet includes key vitamins (e.g., vitamins C and D), nutrients (e.g., iron, selenium), fiber (e.g., leafy greens), probiotics (e.g., yogurt), and prebiotics (e.g., garlic, seaweed). With a healthy diet, you can get most of these nutrients every day. However, you might not be able to get optimal amounts, which is why it can be helpful to supplement your meals with [Ens Superfoods](https://ensosuperfoods.com/blogs/supergreens/what-to-mix-super-greens-powder-with).
