Homeopathic Medicine Q & A What is homeopathic medicine? Homeopathic medicine, or homeopathy, is a type of natural medicine based on the belief that \"like cures like.\" This concept is similar to the way flu vaccinations work. When a tiny amount of the virus is injected into your body, it activates your immune system. In the future, your immune system can then fight off a viral infection and prevent the flu. In homeopathic medicine, practitioners use a substance that's known to cause a specific set of symptoms. When they administer a very diluted dose of that substance, it stimulates the body's healing process and treats those symptoms. For example, your provider may use a homeopathic dilution of red onion to treat watery eyes. How do you decide which homeopathic medicine to use? Homeopaths are extensively trained to interview patients and develop an in-depth understanding of their symptoms. Before you receive homeopathic medicine, you'll have an extensive interview with your provider at Genesis Natural Medicine Center. After talking about your lifestyle, body type, genetics, and physical, mental, or emotional symptoms, your provider determines which homeopathic remedy fits your needs and the appropriate dose you need to take. You may need more than one homeopathic medicine, depending on your symptoms. What types of homeopathic medicines do you use? The remedies or medicines used in homeopathic treatments come from plants, minerals, or biological materials. Homeopathic medicines are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and carefully manufactured according to the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States. Each medicine begins as a concentrated extract from the source material. Then, the extract goes through successive dilutions. Every time it's diluted, it's vigorously shaken, then diluted again. This process is repeated many times until it reaches the desired degree of dilution. The result is an active ingredient that's incorporated into a tablet, liquid, dissolvable pellet, eye drops, creams, and other forms. These are a few examples of substances that are diluted to produce homeopathic medicines: - Mountain arnica - Onion - Wild rosemary - St. John's wort - Daisies - Sodium chloride - Calcium carbonate - Magnesium phosphate You may recognize some of those ingredients because they're also found in dietary supplements. However, homeopathic remedies use extremely low doses. If you'd like to learn more about homeopathic medicine, call Genesis Natural Medicine Center or schedule an appointment online. "}
