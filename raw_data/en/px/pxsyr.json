Official Code \u00a7\u00a7 38-281 et seq. (2016 Supp .)); and pursuant to the Social Security Act , approved February 22, 2012 (Pub.L. 112-96; 42 U.S.C . \u00a7 618(c)); the Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 2014 (\"CCDBG Act\" ), approved November 19, 9858 regulations promulgated thereunder at 45 C.F.R. Parts 98 and 99, hereby gives notice of the inten t to repeal Sections 300 to 379 in Chapter 3 (Child Development Facilities ) of Title 29 ( Public Welfare ) of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (\"DCMR\") , and to add a new Chapter 1 ( Child Development Facilities : Licensing ) to Subtitle A ( Office of the State Superintendent of Education ) of Title 5 DCMR (Education ). The overarching purpose of proposed rulemaking is to ensure that car e provided in a licensed Child D evelopment Facility is not only s afe, but also supports children' s healthy developm ent and future academic achievement and success by establish ing the minimum requirements necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of children in care. In addition, the proposed rulemaking will align the District's regulatory framework for chil d development facilities with the CCDBG Act and the regulations promulgated there under . The proposed rulemaking also aligns with the Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards; Guidelines for Early Care and Education Programs , 3rd Edition (American Academy of Pediatrics, American Public Health Association, National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care and Early Education , Washington DC (2011) (available at http://cfoc.nrckids.org/StandardView.cfm )) (\"Caring for Our Children\") . The CCDBG Act made sweeping statutory changes that will require significant reforms to the District's Child Development Facility regulations to raise the health, safety, and quality standards of child care and ensure more stable child care assistance to families. These new require ments reflect current research on the importance of stable, high quality early experiences to children's future success . In addition, studies have shown the increasing cost of child care and the important role of financial assistance in helping parents afford child care. As with the 2 reauthorized CCDF, this proposed rulemaking hopes to be an integral part of supporting families and promoting both the healthy dev elopment of children in the District of Columbia and parents' pathways to the middle class . The majority of the current regulations at Chapter 3 of Title 29 DCMR were last revised in 2007. In 2008, regulatory responsibility over child development faciliti es was transferred from Department of Health (DOH) and Department of Human Services (DHS) to the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). Accordingly, this proposed rulemaking deletes the regulations regarding licensing requirements from Cha pter 3 , Title 29 DCMR and creates a new Chapter 1 , Title 5 -A DCMR, which sets out OSSE's duties, to clarify that OSSE is the lead agency regulating child development facilitie s and establishing eligibility and reimbursement rates for subsidized child care . Furthermore, this proposed rulemaking is necessary to update the operating standards for child development facilities in the District, both to satisfy the requirements of the CCDBG Act and to update the current regulations to reflect current research and best practices in child development. In the new Chapter 1 (Child Development Facilities : Licensing ) of Title 5 -A DCMR , the proposed rulemaking sets forth (1) the framework for obtaining and maintaining a license to operate a child development Facility in the District , and (2) the requirements and standards that apply to all licensed child development facilities including the new CCDBG requirements for health and safety standards, training and professional development standards for caregivers, teachers, a nd directors, and enhanced comprehensive background checks. The proposed rulemaking also incorporate s amendments to reflect public comments received in response to a n Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) that was posted on OSSE's website on Dece mber 24, 2015 , and provided to the early learning community . The comment period was open until February 8, 2016. It is important to note that this proposed rulemaking may appear significantly different from the ANPR. This is because OSSE received twenty -two (22) written comments from various stakeholders , OSSE carefully considered the comments received , and sought to make thorough and thoughtful amendments . The amendments include , among others: removing specific reference to Q uality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) requirements ; removing the five (5) year license duration required for substantial compliance with QRIS; updating the criminal background check section to allow for provisional employment while background check s are pending , to comply with CC DBG; updating various sections to conform Montessori requirements to actual practice; adding a list of information that OSSE is required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9858c(c)(2)(D) to have publicly available regarding the monitoring and inspection of licensed Facilities ; removing language that created unnecessary ambiguity and inconsistent monitoring and enforcement by OSSE's licensing specialists; replacing the term \"Director \" with OSSE ; clarifying the immunization exemptions and compliance requirements to provide som e flexibility for centers and parents; providing explicit guidance on positive drug tests for marijuana; removing unnecessary information about children and staff , such as the social security number and make/model of car , from record keeping requirements; clarifying specific requirements for drug and alcohol testing program pursuant to CYSHA ; conforming lead-based testing requirements to the requirements established by the Department of Energy and Environment (\"DOEE\") ; eliminating restrictive regulatory la nguage such as a requirement to use \"foot ped al trash cans\"; adding an exemption from licensing for adult education facilities 3 providing care while parents are on same site as child but in class for a temporary period; and providing g uidance on maintenance of shared helmets for those using wheeled vehicles. Further, OSSE received public comments describing the confusion around whether private schools are required to be licensed, especially because DCPS and public charter school s are not required to be li censed to serve pre-K age children. The definition of \"Child Development Facility\" in D.C. Official Code \u00a7 7-2031 specifically excludes private schools \"engaged in legally required and related functions\" from the definition and therefore the requirement to be licensed . OSSE interpret s this provision to mean a private school with a pre -K program, serving pre-K age children, is not required to be licensed for services provided during the instructional day. This interpretation aligns with conforming amendments made to the Facilities Act when the Pre-k Act was passed to exempt pre-K programs in DCPS, public charter and high quality community based organizations from licensure . The proposed rulemaking makes this exemption clear, namely that private schools offer ing both k -12 services and pre -k servi ces are exempted from licensure for services provided during the instructional day . Further, OSSE received comments seeking a method of licensure that allow s private schools to maintain their autonomy while still ensur ing that health and safety requirements are complied with. To address that comment , the proposed rule making has specifically exempted private, parochial, or independent schools that (1) also offer k -12 education, (2) are duly accredited , and ( 3) are caring for infants and toddlers from provisions in the rulemaking around daily program activities and teacher qualifications. OSSE did not make amendments to the proposed rulemaking based on comments received if the commenter's requested amendment may have conf licted with provisions in Caring for Our Children or the CCDBG Act. The U.S. Department of Education, Administration for Children and Families relied heavily on Caring for Our Children in the development of the CCDBG Act. For example, one commenter request ed allowing the use of cloth diapers at parent's discretion. Standard 3.2.1.1 of Caring for Our Children , however, requires only disposable diapers with absorbent material unless the child has a medical reason that does not permit the use of disposable dia pers to limit fecal contamination in child development facilities. Another example includes adjusting the adult -to-child ratio during nap or rest periods for children thirty months or younger. Caring for Our Children , however, specifically provides that th ese ratios are required to be maintained for children thirty (30) months or younger due to the need for closer observation, the frequent need to interact during the period while children are resting, and to rapidly respond to situations where these childre n require more assistance than older children for evacuation purposes. A final example includes public comments asking OSSE to decrease the adult -to-child ratio while children are swimming, wading, or engaged in water play. OSSE did not decrease these rati os because Caring for Our Children specifically provides that these ratios will reduce the risk of injury due to drowning or water -related injury particularly because children may slip into the water silently without any splashing or screaming. Additiona lly, this proposed rulemaking may appear significantly different from the ANPR because OSSE reorganiz ed the sections in a way it believed would be most efficient for providers. Instead of spreading requirements throughout each subject matter, OSSE placed t he narrow and specific requirements for each classification in one respective section. 4 Finally, the proposed rulemaking reserves Subsections 103.5(d) and 129.2(d) for requirements to limit, eliminate, and protec t children from lead -based water hazards. C urrently, pursuant to the Childhood Lead Poisoning Screening and Reporting Act of 2002, effective October 1, 2002, (D.C. Law 14 -190; D.C. Official Code \u00a7\u00a7 7 -871.01 et seq. (2012 Repl.) ), every child who resides in the District of Columbia shall receive a b lood lead screening as part of a well -child care visit, once between ages of six ( 6) months and fourteen ( 14) months, and a second time between ages twenty -two ( 22) months and twenty -six ( 26) months. If a child's age exceeds twenty -six (26) months, and a b lood lead screening has not been performed, the child shall be screened twice prior to the age of six (6) years. If the screening results show elevated blood lead levels, DOEE may perform a lead inspection or risk assessment at the child's home. See 20 DCM R \u00a7\u00a7 3301 et seq. If no lead -based hazard has been identified in the child's home, DOEE will then perform a lead inspection or risk assessment at the child development facility and issue a Risk Assessment Report. If a lead based hazard has been identified, DOEE will issue a notice of enforcement action requiring remediating the hazard if the lead -based hazard can be contained. If the lead - based hazard is presenting imminent danger to the children at the Facility, DOEE may issue recommendations to OSSE to cl ose the Facility. Also, provisions to protect children from lead - based paint hazards are in the proposed rulemaking in Subsections 103.5(c), 129.2(c), and 152.4 through 152.5. The State Superintendent also hereby gives notice of the intent to take final r ulemaking action to adopt these proposed rules in not less than thirty (30) days after the publication of this notice in the D.C. Register.
