Sales of dietary supplements in the United States dou- bled every two years between 1991 and 1999.1According to the Natural Marketing Institute, a consulting group that monitors con-sumer trends, nearly $17 billion was spent on dietary supplementsin 2001 in the United States\u2014with herbal remedies estimated togenerate $4 billion. 2Izzo and Ernst have estimated that Europe spends nearly $7 billion on herbal therapies.3 Along with this sustained growth in usage has come increasing scrutiny into the safety of herbal remedies. On the one hand, somestudies find evidence that certain herbs may be effective for specificconditions. But on the other hand, there is growing evidence thatmany products available on the U.S. market are of poor quality. 4In addition, several studies have found herbal products that are con-taminated with prescription drugs, pesticides, or heavy metals. 5As is the case with pharmaceuticals, even the highest quality herbalremedies have dangers inherent to their use; dangers of which con-sumers often are unaware. A National Consumers League surveyreleased in 2002 found that 86% of Americans believe that productslabeled \"natural\" are safe. 6Yet if herbal remedies are effective, they must contain biologically active chemicals, which increases thepossible risk of side effects and interaction with other drugs. This article will focus on the interactions between herbal reme- dies and pharmaceutical drugs. Research in this area has been slowto develop, in part because of a failure to recognize the significanceof the problem. Systematic reviews of the medical literature reveal relatively few case reports. 7Some take this to mean that the risks of herbal reme- dies are being blown out of proper proportion as a way to distractpublic attention from the risks of pharmaceuticals. 8Yet there also are many reasons to believe that herb-drug interactions have beenunder-reported. As one reviewer commented, \"Lack of evidence ofrisks is clearly not the same as evidence of lack of risks.\" 9However, a number of unexpected bleeding episodes during and after surgeryhave been linked to interactions between herbal remedies and drugsused during and after surgery, leading the American Society of Volume 6 Number 4 \u007f April 2003 \u007f Pages 37-48INSIDE Table: Herb-drug interactions page 39 Melissa officinalis (lemon balm) to treat herpes labialis page 44 PUFAs and atherosclerotic plaques page 47 Homeopathic arnica and surgery page 48Thomson American Health Consultants Home Page\u2014 http://www.ahcpub.com CME for Physicians\u2014 http://www.cmeweb.com Alternative Medicine Alert is now available on-line.

However, often there is littleinformation on the active ingredient in the remedy, andeven less on which ingredient(s) might interact withdrugs or other herbs. People taking herbs often are treat-ing themselves for chronic ailments for which they like-ly are taking prescribed pharmaceutical drugs. Becausemany patients take herbal remedies without telling theirconventional practitioners, the chances are increasedthat adverse symptoms may not be viewed as interac-tions between herbs and drugs. As more case reports become available involving herbal remedies, it will be important to evaluate thequality of reports. Fugh-Berman and Ernst have devel-oped a 10-point scale that allows ready evaluation of thequality of a case report. 7 Each case is given one point for each criterion satis- fied (see Table 1) , and then the fol- lowing scale: 0-3 points: unevaluable\u2014report contains insufficient likelihood of an interaction; 4-7 points: possible interaction\u2014evidence points to an interaction, but other causes may be involved; 8-10 points: likely interaction\u2014report provides reli- able evidence for an interaction.7 As additional cases of interactions between herbs and drugs are reported, this scoring system gives providers a handy checklist for evaluating the quality of eachreport. These same authors went on to review the med-ical literature and identified 108 case reports of adverseevents alleged to involve interactions between herbalremedies and drugs. 7Using the above system, 74 were classified as unevaluable, 20 were possible interactions,and 14 were likely interactions. Warfarin was the drugmost commonly involved in adverse event reports, whileSt. John's wort was the herb most commonly implicated. The case of St. John's wort is a good example of the importance of conducting rigorous research on herbalremedies. Clinical studies have demonstrated that St.John's wort is as effective as sertraline and imipraminein the treatment of mild depression, but is no more effec-tive than placebo in treating major depression. 11 Increased medical attention and widespread popular useof St. John's wort also has led to it being the herb withthe largest number of case reports of herb-drug interac-tions (85 cases). Of these, 54 involved cyclosporin, 12involved oral contraceptives, seven involved warfarin,nine with antidepressants, and one each with phenpro-coumon, theophylline, and loperamide. 7In addition, four clinical studies have provided more rigorous dataabout the nature of the interactions. 12 Patients taking St. John's wort also may be taking pharmaceutical antidepressants.

A variety of antidepressants were involved, most commonly sertraline, but also including nefazodone andtrazodone. 12Some may assume that treating their condi- tions with both herbal remedies and pharmaceuticaldrugs will bring added benefits; however, this mayincrease the likelihood of adverse effects. Several studies (though not every study) have found evidence that St. John's wort induces one of thecytochrome P450 enzymes, thus providing a mechanismof action to explain the reports of interactions. 13Yet St. John's wort contains several biologically active ingredi-ents, and the extent of the reported herb-drug interac-tions could not be explained by induction of P450enzymes alone. A recent clinical study demonstratedthat after taking St. John's wort for 32 days, patients hada four-fold increase in the expression of P-glycopro-tein. 14This molecular complex functions as a pump to actively eliminate drugs from cells and facilitates thedevelopment of resistance to those drugs, which includemethotrexate, protease inhibitors, and steroids. Researchis ongoing in developing inhibitors of P-glycoproteinthat might serve to enhance the effectiveness of otherdrugs, particularly chemotherapy agents. Clearly, theeffectiveness of those drugs would be counteracted bySt. John's wort. Consumer interest in St. John's wort has led to research into its effectiveness and safety. This hasrevealed evidence of both efficacy and drug-herb inter-actions. As a result, patients can be better advised aboutthe conditions for which St. John's wort may be mostbeneficial, and about the drugs that should be avoided orcarefully monitored if taken concomitantly.

herbs, however, the evidence for herb-drug interactions is of lesser quality. Even with the St. John'swort case reports, only seven (8%) satisfied enough ofFugh-Berman and Ernst's criteria to be classified as\"likely interactions.\" 7Given these limitations, Table 2 has been compiled from many sources to give guid-ance on the types of interactions most likely to occurwith commonly used herbs. Many interactions are supported only by a theoretical connection with theherb's mechanism of action, or a concern based on tradi-tional use. Unfortunately, due to lack of uniform reporting requirements, the incidence of each interaction is notknown.For these reasons, clinicians merely can alert patients to the fact that herbs may interact with other medicationsand dietary supplements. Patients should be encouragedto be open about all the substances they are consuming,regardless of whether they view them as drugs. Suchopenness can be encouraged if clinicians know about therisks and benefits of herbal medicines, including someof the most common herb-drug interactions presented inthis article. Increased surveillance of patients for herb-drug inter- actions is another important way to develop accurateknowledge in this area. If an interaction between an herband a drug is suspected, it should be reported to the Foodand Drug Administration's MedWatch program in the Alternative Medicine Alert 43Table 2 Herb-drug interactions, cont'd Herb Name(s) Drug Name Type of Interaction Signs and Symptoms Type of Evidence St. John's wort Other Potentiation due to Euphoria, drowsiness, Case studies Hypericum antidepressants increased serotonin muscle twitching, sweating, perforatum levels diarrhea, loss of consciousness Various drugs Reduced plasma levels Reduced effectiveness Case reports, metabolized via of drugs due to of drugs taken clinical studies cytochrome P450 induction HIV protease inhibitors) Anticoagulants Reduced effectiveness Loss of anticoagulant Case reports effect Digoxin Reduced effectiveness Loss of cardioprotective Clinical study effect MAO inhibitors Potentiation Elevated blood pressure In vitro studies Photosensitizing Potentiation of Rash, sunburn Animal studies agents (e.g., photosensitivitychlorpromazine,tetracyclines, interferons,isotretinoin) Valerian Barbiturates and Potentiation Prolonged officinalis depressants risk of of Hypertension, especially Case reports Pausinystalia antidepressants hypertension by drug in hypertensive patients yohimbe,Corynantheyohimbe Spironolactone Reduced effectiveness Hypertension Theoretical due to potassium-depleting effects same way as drug-drug interactions are reported (1-800- FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch).

McQueen, PharmD MELISSA OFFICINALIS (LEMON BALM )TRADITIONALLY has been used as a carminative for gastrointestinal distress, including flatulence and colic, or as a mildsedative. 1,2The Greeks and Romans used lemon balm for wound dressings and to treat bites and stings. Investi-gations of its chemical constituents in various in vitroand animal studies reveal antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, astringent, and sedative properties. 2 Pharmacology Melissa officinalis leaves have a range of chemical constituents; of primary importance are the tannins,polyphenols, glycosides, and rosmarinic acid. 2-4Early 44 April 2003work with tannin and polyphenol components demon- strated activity against numerous viruses, including her-pes simplex. 3,5,6Later investigations attribute antiviral effects more specifically acid.7Two non-tannin components inhibit protein biosynthesis byblocking leucine incorporation and ribosomal activity. 8 Mechanism of Action Blockade of receptors used by the herpes virus for cell adsorption prevents viral entry into the cell, therebyinterfering with viral replication. 7 Clinical Trials The earliest clinical trial examining topical melissa for herpes simplex infection was published in 1984.9 Only three other trials have been published, two ofwhich are available in English. 7,10,11 Koytchev's study7was of a lyophilized aqueous extract.3The cream was applied daily for five days and compared to aplacebo of identical vehicle. A priori calculations indi-cated 33 patients per group were needed for 80% power.Because of the irregularly recurring nature of herpesoutbreaks, 120 patients who met inclusion criteria weregiven either melissa or placebo cream with instructionsto begin treatment within four hours of prodromal symp-toms and to return for a physician visit within 24 hours.Sixty-six patients (34 treatment, 32 placebo) compliedand constituted the enrolled subjects. Patients must havehad at least four episodes per year of clinically diag-nosed herpes labialis with typical blister presentationand experienced prodromal complaints of itching, tin-gling, and burning. Physician visits occurred at days 1,2, 3, and 5 after symptom onset. Complaints, number ofblisters, and size of affected area were scored on a scaledeveloped for acyclovir trials. Primary endpoint was symptom score on day 2 (DS2), with a secondary endpoint of total scores (TS) ofsymptoms over five days of treatment. Both groups weresimilar in regard to demographics and baseline charac-teristics of time, duration, and severity of last episode, aswell as time between current and last episodes. Therewas a significant difference (P = 0.042) between treat-ment and placebo groups for mean DS2 (4.03 and 4.94,respectively). The small difference between groups forsymptom scores over the five-day treatment period wasnot significant (P = 0.16) and the physician assessmentshowed a trend toward improvement, but this also wasnot statistically significant (P = 0.083). Difference innumber of blisters present was significant in favor oftreatment when ratings were grouped (0 or 1 blister, and> 2 blisters, P = 0.047), but not when each rating was considered separately (0, 1, 2-3, > 3 blisters, P = 0.15).Investigators concluded that results for primary and sec-ondary endpoints were \"coherent\" and demonstratedefficacy and \"a significant reduction in each of the com-ponents\" of the total score. This well-designed study had validated primary end- points; all statistical tests were used appropriately. UsingDS2 as the primary endpoint is appropriate becausesymptoms of herpes labialis are typically the worst onday 2 of an outbreak. Investigators did compare resultsto previous trials and discussed confounding factors.Major trial limitations include inadequate enrollment tomeet power and overstated conclusions given the resultspresented. There is question as to whether the statistical-ly significant difference between groups on day 2 is clin-ically significant. Other questions involve the lack ofreporting of side effects, if any occurred, and use of con-comitant medications. W\u00f6lbling's 1994 publication described two studies, both using the same 1% extract cream. 11The first was an open-label pilot with 115 patients who had skin andtransitional mucosa herpes simplex infections. The sub-jects were directed to use the cream five times daily untillesions were healed, but for no more than 14 days.Symptoms were assessed at days 0, 4, 6, and 8. On day8, 96% of patients had completed the healing process,which the authors note, has a normal range of 10-14days. The second study in W\u00f6lbling's article was a RDBCT using the same melissa cream against placebo in 116patients. Patients must have had prodrome symptoms forno more than 72 hours, could have either skin or transi-tional mucosa infections, and could not be on any antivi-ral treatment. Patients were to apply cream two to fourtimes daily for at least five but no more than 10 days.Patients were assessed on a 1-4 symptom scale for red-ness, swelling, vesicles, scabs, pain, and healing; lesionsize was measured; and a global assessment of efficacy(GAE, 1-5 scale) was carried out by the patient andphysician at trial end. Groups were similar after random-ization for all characteristics (duration of prodrome,prestudy treatments, and sites of infection) and demo-graphics except for age, because of the inclusion of threechildren in the placebo group. At day 2, there was signif-icantly greater improvement in the melissa group forredness (P < 0.01) and swelling (P < 0.05), but not othersymptoms. Melissa patients had less scabbing, but thisdid not reach significance. A significant difference (P = 0.037) favoring melissa also was found in the pla-nar area on day 2. Melissa also was favored in GAE ratings by both physicians and patients (P = 0.031, Alternative Medicine Alert 45P = 0.022, respectively). Reported side effects included irritation (two in the placebo group, one in the melissagroup) and burning (in two placebo patients). Of threedropouts, one melissa patient withdrew because ofsymptom exacerbation and one did not follow up; theplacebo patient withdrew secondary to persistent itch-ing. A subgroup analysis performed on the herpes labi-alis patients (n = 67) showed a faster decrease in lesionarea in the treatment group that was significant on day 5(P = 0.012), but not on day 2. Outcome measures were appropriate. Investigators discussed a possible bias against the treatment group;patients had a longer duration of symptoms (4.5 hourson average) before beginning treatment than the placebopatients. This explanation is not clear and conflicts withearlier text stating mean prodromal symptom durationswere the same in both groups. A significant trial limita-tion is the variable dosing; there was no explanation ofwhy this was permitted, especially considering results ofthe open-label study. Another limitation is inclusion ofvarious types of herpes infections, leading to difficultiesin comparing characteristics such as lesion size and area.The authors concluded that treatment must be \"started inthe very early stages of the infection\" in order to beeffective, yet there are no conclusive data regarding dif-ferences in outcome compared to timing of treatmentstart to support this statement. Adverse Events Used topically for herpes labialis, adverse events are limited to irritation. There has been one report of exacer-bation of symptoms. 11Patients with hypersensitivity to Melissa officinalis or preparation components should be counseled against use. No interactions are known fortopical administration. 12 There are no known concerns or documented warn- ings against the use of topical preparations in pregnantor lactating women. Formulation and Dosage The proprietary concentrated preparation used in the trials is made with a 1% lyophilized aqueous extract thatis applied two to five times A 1% Melissa offici- nalis 70:1 extract called \"Cold Sore Relief\" is available in the United States from Enzymatic Therapy. Melissa brews or teas used as poultices, although recommended in some references, are unlikely to beeffective. 13 Conclusion Results of the two Level II trials available for analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences in reso-lution of some herpes labialis symptoms in a compari- son of Melissa officinalis extract cream and placebo. However, only one of these trials limited the herpesinfections to labialis, and both have major limitationsthat affect assessment of clinical effectiveness. Theextent to which melissa speeds healing of cold sores hasnot been well quantified and comparisons to antiviraltreatments such as topical acyclovir are needed. Claimsthat melissa, when administered during the prodrome,will prevent full development of an outbreak also needto be tested. Recommendation Despite the positive results of these two trials, there is still not enough evidence to state with certainty thatmelissa extract is an efficacious treatment for herpeslabialis. However, considering that herpes labialis is nor-mally a self-limiting condition, that reported adverseevents for melissa are minor, and that topical pharma-ceutical preparations also are not highly effective, topi-cal melissa extract can be considered an option for treat-ment. Patients should be counseled that although somecontrolled studies demonstrated benefit, the effects maybe minor, are not known with certainty, and may varyaccording to product.

PUFAs and Athero- sclerotic Plaques Source: Thies F, et al. of fatty acids with stability ofatherosclerotic plaques: A 2003;361:477-485. fattyacids (PUFAs) into stability. Design: Double-blind, randomized con- One hundred eighty-eight carotid endarterecto-my (total of 162 patients completed thestudy). Methods: Patients were given either control oil (80:20 blend of palm andsoybean oils); sunflower oil, or fish oilwhile continuing on their drug regimensand regular diet. Each patient took sixcapsules daily (two with each meal)until the date of surgery. Duration oftreatment was 7-189 days (median of 42 days). Plaque morphology was evaluat-ed for evidence of stability or instabili-ty. The researchers measured concentra-tions of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), andlinoleic acid in carotid plaques, and tested for the presence of macrophagesin plaques via immunohistochemicalstaining. Results: Concentrations of EPA and DHA in plaque were highest in patientsreceiving the fish oil capsules. Plaquesfrom patients treated with fish oil had Answer key: 21. d, 22. c, 23. d, 24. a, 25. d.fewer morphologic signs consistent with inflammation than plaques fromthose in the sunflower oil or controlgroups. The number of macrophagesfound within the plaques of subjectsreceiving fish oil was less than in theother two groups. Carotid plaque mor-phology, fatty-acid compositions ofplaque lipid fractions, and macrophageinfiltration did not differ between con-trol and sunflower oil groups. Conclusion: n-3 PUFAs from fish oil supplementation are rapidly incorporat-ed into atherosclerotic plaques and limitinflammatory changes, thereby enhanc-ing plaque stability. Study strength: Adherence to protocol was estimated to be 85-90% in eachtreatment group. Study weakness: No group was ran- domized to a diet high in oily fish. Of note: Study results suggest that ath- erosclerotic plaques are relativelydynamic; the fatty acid content of the80:20 palm and soybean oil blend isstated to closely match that of the aver-age British diet; increased intake of n-6PUFAs from sunflower oil did notaffect the fatty acid composition ofplaque, nor plaque stability comparedwith controls. Did you know? n-3 PUFAs lower triglyceride levels and have been shownto be very effective in reducing rates ofsudden death; the amount of fish oil pro-vided in the capsules can be obtainedthrough regular dietary consumption ofoily fish; macrophages contribute toplaque inflammation and instability;vulnerability of plaque to rupture is theprimary determinant of acute thrombo-sis-mediated cardiovascular events. Clinical import: Although no direct harm was identified with the use of n-6 PUFAs from sunflower oil, therewas evidence of benefit from the use offish oil supplementation. The n-3 PUFAs were incorporated into athero-sclerotic plaques and helped stabilizethem. This is yet another well-designedstudy singing the praises of fish oil,whether through dietary intake or supplementation.

Homeopathic Arnica and Surgery Source: Stevinson C, et al. arnica for prevention of pain andbruising: Randomized placebo-con-trolled trial in hand surgery. J R Soc Med 2003;96:60-65. Goal: To determine whether homeo- pathic trial with three paral-lel arms. Subjects: adults (62 included in final analysis) ages 18-70 yearsundergoing elective surgery for carpaltunnel syndrome. Methods: Patients were placebo, arnica 6C, or arnica 30C to be takenthree times daily for seven days preop-eratively and 14 days postoperatively.Primary outcome measures were pain(questionnaire including a visual ana-logue scale) and bruising (digital evalu-ation of photographs); secondary meas-ures were swelling (measurement ofwrist circumference) and use of anal-gesics (tablet counts). Results: No differences were found between any of the groups on the pri-mary outcome measures of pain andbruising; swelling and use of analgesicsalso revealed no difference between the arnica groups and placebo. Conclusion: Homeopathic arnica is no better than placebo in reducing postop-erative complications such as pain,swelling, and bruising. Study strengths: Trial design; manner in which outcome measures of pain andbruising were determined. Study weaknesses: Minimal swelling or bruising was noted in any of thegroups; unusually frequent administra-tion and lengthy duration of use ofhomeopathic arnica; poor adherence tothe trial regimen seen in more than one-third of the sample; the sample size isrelatively small, although there present-ly exists insufficient literature to drivesample size calculations. Of note: Compared with the placebo group, a greater proportion of partici-pants in both arnica groups guessedwhat they had received. Did you know? If taken orally at all, arnica should only be taken internally inthe form of a homeopathic remedy. Clinical import: The results of this small, but well-done, study support themajority of published data that suggestlittle or no benefit from the peri-opera-tive use of homeopathic arnica; howev-er, patients continue to use, and somepractitioners regularly recommend,arnica in such a circumstance. The goodnews is that a container of homeopathicarnica costs approximately $7 in yourneighborhood health food store, is typi-cally taken once or twice daily for ashort period of time, and does notappear to interfere with medications.Although available data point to a lackof benefit of homeopathic arnica in the peri-operative period, there seemslittle reason to actively recommendagainst its use for those patients soinclined.

The proposed rule, in development since the release of the Dietary Supple-ment Health and Education Act in 1994, would establish standards to ensure that dietary sup-plements and dietary ingredients are not adulterated with contaminants or impurities, and arelabeled accurately to reflect the active ingredients and other ingredients in the product. This proposed rule includes requirements for designing and constructing physical plants, establishing quality control procedures, and testing manufactured dietary ingredients anddietary supplements. It also includes proposed requirements for maintaining records and forhandling consumer complaints related to GMPs. In a press release posted on its web site, the American Botanical Council in Austin, TX, is among several organization to point out that \" ... many responsible manufacturers in the herb and DS [dietary supplement] industry have not waited for FDA's publication of GMPs andhave voluntarily increased their GMPs to meet or exceed what the FDA is projected to beproposing. Also, some manufacturers, because they produce over-the-counter (OTC) drugproducts, already operate under high level GMPs. Need for Manufacturing Standards In recent years, analyses of dietary supplements by a private sector laboratory suggest that a substantial number of dietary supplement products analyzed may not contain the amountsof dietary ingredients that would be expected to be found based on their product labels. Forexample:Five of 18 soy and/or red clover-containing products were found to contain only 50-80% of the declared amounts of isoflavones. \u007fOf 25 probiotic products tested, eight contained less than 1% of the claimed number of live bacteria or the number of bacteria that would be expected to be found in such a product. FDA also has encountered products being marketed that are not accurately labeled or con- tain contaminants that should not be present or may be harmful. For example:\u007fOne firm recalled its dietary supplements that were contaminated with excessive amounts of lead, which may have posed a health risk to many consumers, especially children andwomen of childbearing age. \u007fAnother firm recalled a niacin product after it received reports of nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and heart attack associated with the use of its product. A dietary ingredient man-ufacturing firm had mislabeled a bulk ingredient container that subsequently was used byanother firm in making a product that contained almost 10 times more niacin than theamount that may be safe.

Too often, consumers purchase dietarysupplements based on inaccurate or incomplete infor-mation on what they are getting. This proposed regula-tion would require that dietary supplements provideaccurate information on the type and amount of ingredi-ents they contain and that dietary supplements are pro-duced using safe methods,\" said Mark B. McClellan,MD, PhD, Commissioner of Food and Drugs. \"Con-sumers should have access to dietary supplements thatare accurately labeled and are free from contaminants.\" FDA's action also will permit more informative research on dietary supplements, to improve the scienceavailable on their safety and effectiveness. \"We com-mend FDA for proposing good manufacturing practicesthat will help ensure that all dietary supplements are ofthe quality that the public deserves. Since credibleresearch studies cannot be performed using many of thecurrent, highly variable products, these practices willalso speed our ability to provide the public with moredefinitive data about the safety and effectiveness of pop-ular dietary supplements,\" said Stephen Straus, MD,Director, National Center for Complementary and Alter-native Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. This proposed regulation follows the agency's con- sumer initiative announced last December intended toimprove FDA's policies on providing information abouthealth consequences of food and dietary supplementsand to increase enforcement efforts to prevent mislead-ing health claims made by certain dietary supplementmanufacturers. By putting in place requirements thatwill ensure universal good manufacturing practices, theproposed regulation should serve to eliminate the guess-work for consumers about which dietary supplementsmay or may not be of high quality. In turn, manufactur-ers of dietary supplements will have to compete basedon the quality of their products, not through potentiallymisleading labels or inexpensive, but less safe, manufac-turing processes. Manufacturers' Obligations Under the GMP proposal, manufacturers would be required to evaluate the identity, purity, quality, strength,and composition of their dietary ingredients and dietarysupplements. In addition, manufacturers would berequired to: \u007fEmploy qualified employees and supervisors; \u007fDesign and construct physical plants in a manner to protect dietary ingredients and dietary supplementsfrom becoming adulterated during manufacturing,packaging, and holding; \u007fUse equipment and utensils that are of appropriate design, construction, and workmanship for theintended use; \u007fEstablish and use a quality control unit and master manufacturing and batch production records; \u007fHold and distribute materials used to manufacture, package, and label dietary ingredients, dietary sup-plements, and finished products under appropriateconditions of temperature, humidity, light, and sanita-tion so that their quality is not affected; \u007fKeep a written record of each consumer product qual- ity complaint related to GMPs; and \u007fRetain records for three years beyond the date of manufacture of the last batch of dietary ingredients ordietary supplements.If dietary supplements contain contaminants or do not contain the dietary ingredient they are represented tocontain, FDA would consider those products to be adul-terated. Some product quality problems the GMPswould help prevent include products that are super-potent or subpotent; that contain the wrong ingredient, adrug contaminant, or other contaminants (e.g., bacteria,pesticide, glass, lead); that contain foreign material; andthat are improperly packaged and mislabeled. This proposal is intended to cover all types of dietary supplements. However, to limit any disruption fordietary supplements produced by small businesses, FDAis proposing a three-year phase-in of a final rule forsmall businesses. The proposal includes flexible stan-dards that can evolve with improvements in the state ofscience, such as in validating tests for identity, purity,quality, strength, and composition of dietary ingredients. FDA is soliciting comments from the public and industry on how this proposed regulation can bestachieve the goals of promoting accurate labeling infor-mation and preventing adulteration without imposingunnecessary regulatory burdens. Written comments willbe received until 90 days after the date of publication inthe Federal Register and may be addressed to Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and DrugAdministration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061,Rockville, MD 20852.
