It turns out that the environmental effects on behaviour are a lot stronger than most people expect.\" Nobel Prize -winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman Executive Summary In terms of public health, and specifically in the field of pandemic management the ultimate purpose of communication interventions are focused on increasing awareness , understanding , developing confidence to act appropriately and in the final analysis to impact on behaviour . The challenge is not simply to change behaviour, action is needed to influence the uptake of protective behaviours , action directed at altering current behaviours to reduce harm and actio n aimed at encouraging the maintenance of positive behaviours . There is a co -dependency between the impact that vaccines can have in reducing the harm associated with influenza and the processes and systems put in place to influence the behaviour of servi ce provide rs, influencers in sectors such as the media and the behaviour of individual citizens. It could be argued that influencing behaviour is the most important factor in reducing harm caused by influenza as vaccine uptake depends on the behaviour of health professionals and other influencers as well as the adoption of preventive behaviours on the part of citizens and the availability and access to effective vaccines . Scope and aims of this p aper This paper does not aim to be a fully comprehensive or systematic review. It is also not a technical guide to behavio ur change models or behaviour change planning. The paper is a structured review that seeks to distil in a single document and set out in an accessible way a summary of some of the key insights and principles related to health behaviour change derived from, policy documents, systematic reviews, summary text and selected key academic papers. One practical issue is that the sheer volume of available material of relevance and the technical language of the behavioural science literature over recent decades can present a significant barrier to the uptake and use of developing insights by public health planners and policy makers. The paper has been developed at a time when many other papers focused on summarising principles of health focused behaviour change have been published and others are being commissioned across Europe. This paper attempts to draw on these publications and the growing body of research on what influences behaviour. With its focus on capturing and synthesising some of the key learning in the field it is hoped that the paper adds some value by not duplicating past or current efforts to produce behavioural change g uidance and reviews. Rather than setting out to be a com prehensive review it is intended that the paper be a helpful summary o f the state of play of this fiel d and a starting point for those wishing to develop a greater understanding of how learning from fields of study associated with behaviour change can be applied in pandemic control and management. The paper also addresses some of the key policy and polit ical influences on decisions regarding programm e selection and implementation that tend not to be included in the vast majority of technical and academic reviews and papers referenced in this paper. This is clearly a vital element that needs to be consider ed in any strategic review of pandemic 4 communication and management. This discussion covers issues related specifically to the need of public institutes to obtain what Mulgan1 calls 'public permission' for state directed actions in the field of pandemic ma nagement when issues concerned with the curtailment of personal freedoms and the role of perso nal responsibility are involved . The paper goes beyond consideration of just public education and influence to consider implications of professional practice. Influencing the behaviour of professionals and policy makers is a key challenge as thei r behaviours impact on the delivery of appropriate surveillance , selecting and administering of awareness and behavio ural interventions as well as the design and implement ation of evidence based influencing programmes. One of the central conclusions of this paper is that a growing body of evidence and experience indicates th at simply providing information and instruction even if it is well designed, communicated and targeted will in many cases be insufficient to bring about a required level of compliance with the key pers onal behaviours necessary to assist in the containment of pandemic events. There is a great deal of evi dence that makes it clear that the public's views and actions related to vaccine acceptance is driven by a mix of access issues but also social , psychological, cultural norms, and access to timely and trusted information. All of these factors need to be understood and taken into account by those responsible for planning for and managing pandemic events.2 As stated by Heidi et al3: 'Public trust in vaccines is highly variable and building trust depends on understanding perceptions of vaccines and vaccine risks, historical experiences, religious or political affiliations, and socioeconomic status'. This paper makes the case and brings together some of the evidence that indicates that whilst the provision of accurate and e vidence based information is a vital part of the process of communicating and managing pandemic events4 information and its communication are seldom enough to ensure full compliance with recommended personal management and vaccine uptake behaviours. This paper seeks to set out some of the additional Forms and T ypes of intervention that can be built into communication and broader behavio ural change strategies. This work draws on existing and emerging evidence about why people act as they do, the choices they make and how this understa nding might be used in the development of a more systematic and effective approach to planning delivering, and evaluation behavioural programmes associated with pandemic events. This paper also sets out in summary form a brief review of some key theoreti cal concepts and models that are traditionally used to inform the planning and delivery of some behavioural change programmes. The paper also inclu des a summary of some of the attempts to produce taxonomies and totalising model s of these theories and models and a review of some of the common planning models used to develop communication and behavioural influencing programmes. The final section of the paper deals with some of the key processes that need to be considered when pl anning communication and behavio ural programmes associated with the management of pandemic events. 1 Mulgan Behavio ural Insight Team First year annual report.

Well researched, well planned and targeted communications programmes are a vital part of all pandemic management and control intervention programmes. However, the tendency to rely on simplistic information transmission and processing models of influence ca n reduce the impact of these programmes. Some of the new social policy and heath tools that behavioural scientists and others working in the field of behaviour influence have developed based on a growing body of behavioural research summarised in books suc h as; Thinking Fast and Thinking slow5, Nudge6 and Influence7 have generated a lot of interest amongst many policy makers and planners in government health sector organisations. This new work confirms and makes accessible the understanding that a much wide r range of human motivations exist that just rational self -interest based on logical information processing. This new understanding makes clear the need for strategies of influence that go beyond the transmission of factually accurate logical information a s the main way to influence behaviour and opinion prior to, during and after pandemic events. Multiple interventions are more successful . The effectiveness of single interventions in isolation does not appear to be as great as combining ones that impact on conscious decision making and decisions that are influenced by other mental processes and external factors such as social norms and incentives. Economic instruments can provide the stimulus for change with communication and choice editing shaping succe ssful uptake. (See separate report under Work Programme 3 focused on incentives) Humans are not entirely rational when making health choices and this understanding needs to be reflected in pandemic programmes . We do not simply decide on the basis of well -presented information to act in way that demonstrates that they have carefully considered the costs and benefits of an action and then selected the option that results in maximum personal or family benefit. Instead, there are numerous internal and externa l influences on an individual's behaviour that need to be considered and influenced. If we are to influence health behaviour we need to apply a more sophisticated approach to understanding and developing more comprehensive strategies to influence behaviou r that include, but go beyond the transmission of scientifically accurate information to include influencing strategies that target non rational choice. There are clearly considerable ethical issues associated with such approaches that will need to be cons idered. Behavioural models and theory can help strengthen the development delivery and evaluation of pandemic communication and behavioural programmes. One of the tentative conclusions that can be drawn from this review is that theories intended to modi fy individual level behaviours remain the most commonly applied in pandemic events. Policy and training interventions could be developed to broaden this focus to include ecological theory and models to guide research, intervention design and evaluation. Wh en constructing behavioural interventions the use of several theories and models appears to assist with identifying the key elements which are of most use in either explaining the behaviour or predicting what will influence change. This understanding can b e used as the foundation around which communications and messaging can be designed, and other forms and types of influence developed. This is the approach Darnton recommends to 5 Kahneman D, Thinking fast and thinking slow Macmillan. 2011. 6 Thaler R & Sunstein C, Nudge: Improving decisions about health, wealth and happiness, Penguin 2009 7 N. Goldstein; S. Martin; R. Cialdini. Yes! 50 Secrets from the Science of Persuasion , Profile Books 2007 6 policymakers 8. There will be occasions however, when existing behavioural theory is not available or appropriate. In these circumstances it will be necessary to use existing theory and models to build a behavioural framework from scratch to inform programme planning design and evaluation. It is not sufficient to consider an individual's voluntary behaviour change in isolation. The impact of social, economic and environmental factors have a large influence on people's ability to behave in certain ways and their motivat ion to do so. The behaviour of others and the general cultural and social environments expressed though notions of social capital and community resilience also needs to be considered and often targeted if individuals are to be helped to sustain a positive behaviour or modify a less healthy behaviour. The role of communication and other forms of behavioural influence such as nudging outlined in this paper focus mainly on changing 'voluntary' behaviour, rather than enforcing behaviour change. However, governm ents supported by public health institutions in some pandemic situations will need to use tools to 'enforce' rather than encourage behaviour change. It needs to be recognised that when the health threat is great governments may need to use different tools to influence people to become compliant including incentives and or sanctions. The use of such tools will also need to be accompanied by communication and behaviour change programmes that seek to engage, explain and involve people in the execution of such non-voluntary change interventions such as fines or restrictions of movement or assembly. Recommendations Citizen9 Focused Solutions. If the outcome of pandemic communication and behavioural influencing strategies is to achieve a positive, accurate an d trusted understanding and experience of government policies related to pandemic management and compliance with recommended actions the approach must be to move away from a top down one way communication dominated model. We need to move towards a model that is based on customer needs, dialogue and feedback with people we seek to influence and an approach that is responsive to demands and changing circumstances. We also need an approach that is focused more on impact and outcome measurement in terms of ac tual behaviour. Public Permission Matters. The more powerful and subtle behavioural change approaches are, the more they may provoke public and political concern. Behavioural approaches that embody a line of thinking that moves from the idea of an autono mous individual making rational decisions to a decision -maker, much of whose behaviour is automatic and influenced by their choice environment raises the question of who decides on and who can influence this choice environment? One of the key challenges th at will face public health planners who seek to use no - rational approaches that seek to build relationship influence is how the permission to use these approaches will be given and legitimised in order that a backlash of public opinion does not result in accusations of trickery and manipulation. The advances in understanding and methodological development in the field of systematic health programmes and behaviour change planning need to be better integrated into pandemic communication and behavioural inf luence programme management . 8 Darnton 2008 op.cit. 9 We use the t erm 'citize n' to indicate members of the public, the exact word to be used will need to be considered in the light of debate resolution in relation to the issues raised in section two of this paper. 7 The development of more systematic approach to health behaviour change 10 and a growing body of research11 that goes beyond communication theory 12 has been developing over recent years13 14. Intervention forms such as social marketing15, co-creation16 and community engagement17 are examples of these new forms of social policy delivery. This development along with more general improvement in social policy implementation18 planning19 has resulted in a growing consensus about how to g o about establishing, delivering and evaluating more successful behavioural programmes in the social sector. This understanding should be used to shape intervention programmes. Evidence driven but not evidence restricted. It is probable that governments and public health agencies will always use some forms and types of intervention that are not fully supported by strong evidence. Interventions such as social advertising should not be dismissed as ineffective, rather gover nment and public health organisations should ensure that they apply best practice when developing these forms of intervention. A culture of systematic planning and evaluation should be encouraged to enable transparent reporting on the impact and efficienc y of all programmes. This will help with developing the evidence base20 for communication and behaviour change interventions in the field of pandemic management. The use of pilot testing should also feature in all programmes. Cultural and organisational issues, the status of communication and marketing. Behavioural influence and communications often exists as a bolted on adjunct (all be it a vital one) to the influence of medical and epidemiological understanding in the policy development and strategy de velopment process. Communication and those responsible for influencing behaviour in relevant organisations often operates in an environment where messages and policies are developed prior to and independently from a marketing and communications strategy. T his often leads to a producer -led selling approach, i.e. a focus on broadcasting evidence based messages about risk reduction and communication focused on compliance with medical opinion. A significant cultural and technical shift is required within govern ments and specialist responsible agencies to a more customer -led marketing approach, and a fully integrated partnership between marketing and communications professionals and policy and delivery professionals. Capacity and Capability. Marketing practitio ners in many governments across Europe have excellent technical skills, but there are many countries where this capacity is not so well developed.

The implications of adopting such an approach could include countries undertaking a marketing and communications capacity and skills audit and the development of an assistance programme to develop training courses and mechanisms fo r sharing of best practice and skills and other competences for example, influencing policy makers, stakeholder management and leadership skills. Budgets and other assets. All EU countries hold and deploy their own resources alongside neighbouring countries and also the efforts of international regional organisations such as ECDC, CDC, WHO. Annual budget allocations can fuel short -termism. Budgets are also often allocated as a single entity rather than being divided between development, piloting, execution and evaluation. Ideally budgets should be allocated to cover the complete timescale for the planned activity and should be justified not only in terms of achieving quantifi ed objectives and in terms of programme delivery, but also how the activity will contribute to the overall strategy as a whole. The possibility of cross boarder alignment of marketing and communication resources should be investigated to ensure that budget management is optimal. Silo research and evaluation. There are no current reliable estimates for how much is spent on marketing and communications research in the field of pandemic preparedness and management across Europe. However, it is reasonable to conclude given the size and importance of the issue to governments that the aggregate figure is significant. Most of this research is commissioned for individual agency programmes rather than for the European common good. The implications of adopting such an approach would include: Closer liaison and co -ordination with medical, epidemiological, social and marketing and communications research Initiate more centrally/ joint -funded marketing and communications research projects to minimise overlaps and max imise strategic joined up opportunities. Use 'upstream' horizon scanning and developmental research to pro -actively set the strategic marketing and communications agenda across European countries and specialist agencies. Develop standardised procedures for evaluative research to demonstrate the effect of pandemic marketing and communications programmes with the public but also inter and internal organisational communications programmes. This research should develop protocols for process measur es of campaign efficiency, impact evaluation i.e. short term change such as awareness, as well outcome measures such as behaviour change or compliance. 9 \"Prevention can be much more cost -effective than cure. Especially when targeted at groups with high ri sks, prevention can be substantially more cost -effective .\"21 Introduction Methodology This paper has been developed under work programme three of the E -com@eu project. It consists of a report on behavioural analysis indicating how new and emerging understanding about influencing behaviour can be used to design behavioural interventions to promote service uptake with reference to pandemic events. The paper has been developed following an extensive structured but non -systematic review of relevant lit erature . The project involved a desk -based review of literature including summary of behaviour change reviews, policy documents in the field of pandemic planning and communication, existing pandemic guidance regarding communication and behaviour change, an d behavioural change guides. The review focused on the following areas: Behaviour change models Behavio ural change theory Behavio ural Economics Social Psychology Social Marketing Programme P lanning An indicative topic analysis was performed to define the search terms, and identify potentially relevant disciplines for the topic. This enabled the identification of relevant databases to focus the search strategy. Citation analysis techniques were utilised to identify key seminal works, enabling the colla tion of an index of key terms which were utilised in behavioural change literature to focus the tr awl of the available literature, see table one. Table 1: Inclusion Criteria Category Criteria Scope Systematic reviews Evidence based reviews Meta analyses Conceptual boundaries Behaviour change Social marketing Health improvement Interventions Throughout the literature, the concept of attempts to promote or support behaviour change is reflected in a large number of ways. Terms utilised to identify such interventions in this review include: initiative, scheme, action, activity, campaign, policy, strategy, procedure, programme, intervention and project.

Searches were conducted initially on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) for English language systematic reviews date limited to between, 2005 -2012. This enabled the primary identificat ion of systematic reviews from respected source s. Alongside this search, a number of other academic databases and websites were trawled to ensure broad data capture. A full list of the other academic databases and websites searched is appended at Annex e A. These searches were restricted by additional terms including 'review', 'meta -analysis', 'evidence -based review' or 'systematic review'. In addition, an email was also sent out via a public health academic e -group to ident ify any relevant 'grey literature', but with very limited success. Whilst the initial review identified a significant number of studies within the general topic areas, subsequent analysis of the abstracts for these studies showed that the majority of the reviews focused on technical interventions, such as reducing the tar content in cigarettes, or provision of placebos, rather than behaviour modification. Such studies were excluded from this report. See annex e one for further details. In addition to the references listed in annexe one a large number of additional sources of relev ant material were identified fro m more generic search of the literature and published books and governmental reviews. These reviews and papers are inserted as direct footnotes in t he body of each section of the paper. This paper aims to distil from this wide body of behaviour change literature, those elements that are most useful for public health officials and planners working in the field of pandemic management, communication an d behavio ural influence. The paper is designed not to just explore issues but to develop a set of potential tools that can be used by practitioners and policy makers to further develop pandemic communication and behaviour change programmes. The paper inclu des: 1. A summary of some of the key research and theory based insights about behaviour and how to influence it. 2. A number of conceptual models that may help those concerned with pandemic management and possibly other public health challenges analyse the s trengths and weaknesses of current approaches and model the application of more comprehensive strategies. 3. A discussion of some of the key practical, theoretical, political, policy and ethical issues that need to be considered related to the management and communication of pandemic events . Due to the highly emotive and potent ially large impact on public freedoms and the need for personal as well as state responsibility to be harnessed the paper explores and sets out suggestions about how public health offic ials, politicians and ot her stakeholders can build new thinking about influencing behaviour in an ethical way into pandemic preparation and management 11 4. A number of 'checklists' , and quick reference summary tools or 'proto tools' for testin g in lat er stages of the E -Com programme have been developed as part of this element of work package 3. Understanding Behaviour and W hat Influences I t This paper explores a number of the more common theories and models of behaviour that are used by some more so phisticated approaches to communication and behavioura l influence in the pandemic fiel d. However , it is clearly the case that n o 'one' theory or model can off er a full explanation or be predictive in terms of behaviour. \"The psychological literature is extensive and provides a number of general models of health behaviour and behaviour change. However, the research literature evaluating the relevance and use of these models is inconsistent. \"22 The range of theories encompasses elements of pers onal, social and environmental factors. Clearly behaviour and the decisions that impact on it operate in an interactive way. Unlike natural science interventions where cause and effect can often be reasonably demonstrated because it is possible to account for variable s. However, given the complex set of interrelated factors that affect dynamic human behaviour that takes place in a fluid environment it is far more difficult to prove cause and effect or to devel op strong predictive models or theories. It is als o worth no ting that behaviour often changes gradually over time and is subject to a constant revision base on learning and environmental circumstances . \"Our behaviours are the result of the interaction of our inherent psychological makeup with the knowledge, attitud es, values and behaviour that we acquire, and the ways in which our psychology is influenced by family habits and dynamics, peer pressure, and community, societal and cultural influences. The result is a lifestyle which is not freely chosen but rather is a reflection of the family, community, societal and cultural lifestyle, values and norms in which we are immersed and by which we are influenced .\"23 A major weakness of the majority of models that are quoted most often in social interventions is the dominant conception of human behaviour as being driven by logic, learning, a desire to maximise personal gain and a considered response to social and environmental influencers. Most models are set out as cause and effect schematics. This paper , however , explores i n addition to these models how human behaviour is influenced by non-rational factors including social and psychological factors, environm ental prompts, incentives and disincentives, design and emotional responses linked to unconscious choosing and how thes e can be incorporated into behavio ural influencing programmes . 22 Behaviour Change at Population, Community and Individual L evels, National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence, October 2007, Page 9 23 Prevention that Works, A Review of the Evidence Regarding the Causation and Prevention of Chronic Disease Consultation Draft, November 2003 Chronic Disease Prevention Initiative: Paper #2 Prevention and Wellness Planning Population Health and Wellness Ministry of Health Planning Victoria BC 12 The Underlying Premise of this P aper The underlying premise of this paper is that there is a need for an expanded communication and behaviour change toolbox that goes beyond the crafting a nd delivery of well planned and executed communication programmes focused on the transmission of scientifically accurate information. The conclusion of this pa per is that those concerned with the management of pandemic events in addition to communication s trategies need to develop specific behavioural strategies to complement communication programmes . Whether they like it or not public health professionals and governments concerned with pandemic management and prevention are in the bus iness of influencing b ehaviour . This paper explores why information is a necessary but not sufficient tool to achieve the aim of effectively influencing behaviour prior to , during and after pandemic events. This paper sets out a model called D -CIDES24 that describes five traditional clusters of policy tools that governments can deploy to influence health behaviour. This is a powerful cluster of intervention options but the limitations of even this traditional set of tools is evident in many social poli cy approaches where we see ineffective or policy failure for example in the fields of obesity, alcohol misuse and drug taking. This paper explores a number of additional ways to influence attitudes , beliefs and behaviours that are emerging fro m fields of social marketing, behavio ural psychology and behavio ural economics as well as other fields such as social design. These emerging additional tools for influencing behaviour that are becoming available to public health specialist s and politicians are under pinned by a set of findings from both the fields of economics and psychology that people do not always act in an demonstrable rational way. Extensive work has been completed in recent years that is enabling us to build a more sophisticated and realistic un derstanding about how people make decisions , express preferences and cho ose to act in the way s that they do. This paper looks at recent findings from a variety of fields of study that have all helped to expand and enhance our understanding of how and why people behave as they do and what can influence them to either maintain positive social behaviour or, change undesirable social behaviour. This learning potentially gives us a more powerful set of principles, which can be used to help design more effective social change interventions. Section seven of this paper explores some of the key evidence that poi nts to the fact that many of the choices and decisions we make that influence our behaviour, are not the result of active considered decision -making. Deci sions and choices are often influenced by unconscious and automatic thinking. These 'decisions' are influenced by a range of what appear to be a set of evolutionary derived heuristic systems that interplay with the specific emotional contexts, social influ ence, environme ntal prompts, and factors such as timing, and our physiological state. However , we are also capable of making considered rational choices. This paper explores the need for a combination of approaches that include interventions that are focused on the transmission of information that assist professional s and the public undertaking logica l considered decision making and approaches that focus more on influencing rapid cognition or what has been called 'mindless choosing'. This paper set s out a review which suggests that the selection of the appropriate mix of these various 'Forms'25 of intervention can be enhanced when combined with some of the more traditional policy intervention tools outlined above and also by the use of theory and the application of systematic planning models. All of these approaches are predicted on the 24 D-CIDES is an acronym for: Control, Inform, Design, Educate, Support . 25 By Forms we mean different states of considered or rapid cognition. This term is further defined in section XXXXX 13 need to develop a deep understanding of the attitudes and beliefs of the group or groups that are being targeted. Much of this new understanding about how to influence behaviour has for many years been used by the commercial sector, often developed through a proce ss of trial and error. What our new evidence based understanding provides are theoretical constructs that can be used to plan future interventions. However , in addition to the application of non -rational forms of influence the business sector has also deve loped a number of distinct new conceptual and practical methodologies focused on influencing customers that have relevance to pandemic communication and behavioural influence programmes . The business community investments hundreds of millions every year in behavioural change programmes to promote the uptake of goods and services. There is good evidence that business success correlated with investment in this f orm of marketing and promotion work. The commercial sector over the last fifteen or so years have increasingly focused on three key concepts that are called 'Relationship Marketing'26 Exchange27 and 'Service Dominant Logic'28. Basically these concepts have moved the commercial sector away from a transactional relationship with clients and customer s to a relationship that seeks to build a valued relationship between the service or product provider and the customer based on trust and good service. A considerable factor in this shift has been the need to apply the new understandings about how people can be i nfluenced to behave, i.e. the need to move beyond the purely logical transaction model to one that influences the deeper and more profound influences on behaviour. These concepts have also been extensively used in public health programmes. The commercial s ector working in support of public health programmes in the developing world for example focused on issues such as oral rehydration, vaccination uptake and HIV prevention have had many successes through t he application of such an approach . The R esponsibility of Public Health Institutions and Planners The role that behaviour change theories and methodologies can play in the planning and evaluation of public health communications activity is beginning to draw attention from policy makers and profe ssionals 29 30 31 32. This interest in behaviour and how to influence it is also being developed in many other areas such as the environment33. This interest is supported by the growing body of evidence and accumulating experience in fields as diverse as, road safety, energy use, safety and health at work that evidence based, theory informed and well planned and executed behavioural change interventions can potentially make con siderable contributions to tackling these problems. 26 Gummesson, E.

This issue is clearly not without profound ethical and political considerations. Issues such as at what level of risk should behavioural change approaches be applied that compel people to behave in a certain way or at what level of risk should government go beyond the provision of just information to strategies focused on compulsion. Work in this field is also complex because it seeks to influence behaviour related to risks that are often difficult to convey and quantify and risks that are likely to change rapidly over time as w as the case with H1N1 in 2009. It is clear that institutions and individuals who shoulder the responsibility for advising governments and policy makers and who are responsible for delivering infor mation and advice to the public have a professional duty t o develop the most comprehensively possible understanding of what influences behaviour and how this understanding can be practically applied. This paper seeks to make a small contribution to this field. \"Too often, people create an elegant plan around the wrong premise or the wrong goal.\" \"A successful programme, no matter how we define it, has got to begin with very clear, realistic, measurable goals,\" says Barbara Beck of the Pew Charitable Trusts. \"Campaign goals that are not explicit and realistic \"34 34 Now Hear This, 2001, Fenton Communications 1320 18th Street, NW, Washington DC 20036 202 -822-5200 www.fenton.com . Sponsored by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation 15 The Behavioural Challenges P osed by Pandemic T hreats The S cale of the 'Wicked P roblem ' Behaviour change programmes require a set of clear measurable and sensible behavioural objectives that need to be achieve d in the timescales of the programme. Often many governmental public health programmes have unrealistic, or, in the opposite extreme, no objectives. These objectives need to be based on thorough research on what is achievable and realistic. In 2010 WHO guidance35 on developing an integrated communication strategy for the distribution of vaccine set out the scale of the challenge and the role of vaccines can play in reducin g the harm associated with H1N1 ; \" In June 2009, WHO declared the first influenza pandemic in over 40 years. Since then, the H1N1 pandemic has spread to almost all countries, but has resulted in mild illness and moderate overall impact in most cases. Nevertheless, experience so far has shown that H1N1 can place a consider able strain on health services and can result in serious illness and death. Young people, pregnant women and those with chronic diseases seem to have the highest rate of complications.\" In addition to this warning WHO also predicted that d evelop ing countries were likely to be at most risk from the pandemic effects, as they faced the dual problem of highly vulnerable populations and limited resources to respond to H1N1. WHO statistics indicate that the 2009 H1N1 virus has killed more than 18,000 people, however, WHO feel that total mortality (I ncluding deaths unconfirmed or unrep orted) from the H1N1 strain is ' unquestionably higher '36. As many as 579,000 people could have been killed by the disease, as only those fatalities confirmed by laboratory testing were included in most calculations; many of those without access to health facilities therefore went unrecorded . The majority of these deaths occurred in Africa and South East Asia37 38. One of the key concerns for those in charge of planning preven tion and service delivery is the unpredictable nature of the pandemic combined with the potential , enormous impact on health and se rvices ability to cope if the severity of the virus is high. A num ber of modelling programmes have been developed such as the CDC \"FluSurge\" 39 software program me, to assist planners and hospital managers. It estimates the number of hospita lisations and deaths that would occur during an influenza pandemic . \"FluSu rge\" compares the number of people hospitalized, the number requiring treatment in the intensive care unit s (ICU), and the number requiring ventilators to a community's existing supplies in different levels threat. 35 Integrated Communication S trategy for D istribution of the H1N1 vaccine Developed by WHO/H1N1 Communications Team and Societal and Individual Measures Team in consult ation with Regions and Partners February 2010 WHO. 36 Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 100\".

Estimated impact is shown in the table below: A guide for managers starkly sets out the implication of these estimates40 \"These figures indicate that an influenza pandemic might overwhelm existing hospital resources, especially given that modern western hospitals increasingly operate at nearly full c apacity\". The potential stress on resources could be even more severe in countries with less well developed systems. Health sector workers need to be prepared for the worst -case scenario, pand emic events such as the 2009 H1N1 place a great deal of strain on health care systems and workers. They also place a great deal of stress on public health systems communication and prevention services concerned with keeping citizens and professional s informed about what is happening and providing advice and support t o undertake appropriate behaviours to mitigate the effects of the infection. One of the notable features of the response were the numerous media and policy critics of the way that WHO, other regional and national public health organisations responded to the outbreak in terms of service provision but especially with regard to public information, awareness and engagement. The WHO Europe review of good practice in preparedness found six consistent major themes, considered by respondents a cross Europe to have been essential elements of successful PPA: These incl uded well planned and executed communication, co-ordination; capacity development, adaptab ility/flexibility of response, leadership; and mutual support. Generally systems had worked well but multi -secto rial involvement, political support and dedicated funding emerged as important success factors. In addition the review recommended that a greater emphasis still needs to be placed on improving planning for the communications element of the programme and in tersect oral co - ordination.41 With regard to communication attempts to influence behaviour there are two types of community -level communication interventions undertaken: mass media campaigns and educational programmes directed at health care workers. In th e case of the 2009 event according to WHO42 the campaigns included a range of interventions from hand hygiene, use of masks through to pandemic vaccine use. Key issues regarding communications included information -sharing among countries and the role of the media and the \"importance of messages being delivered by prominent people in the community\". The report goes on to assert that. The strategies utilized during the influenza pandemic 2009 included 'speaking with one voice', involving academic experts and g overnment officials in the effort, and targeting core groups of at risk populations. 40 The W ork Place Guide for Managers, Avian influenza Prepared for the USAID Avian Influenza Program by the Academy for Educational Development.

WHO also emphasise the complexity of the challenge both developing and co -coordina ting effective interventions and eva luation of their impact; \"Conducting well designed studies in this field is challenging..... Due to ethical considerations, it may be difficult to design studies employing a control group that does not use any protective equipment including masks/respirators given such precautions are routinely recommended for pandemic and seasonal influenza. Given the study limitations, the difficulties in conducting studies, and the fact that there are differences between the diseases th at have already been studied and new emerging diseases, it is not possible to make real -time evidence -based recommendations without a larger evidence base.\" What is clear is that one of the main communication and behavioural influence challenges of such events is that they exhibit a number of specific features in terms of social challenges that Rittel and Webber43 have called 'Wicked Problems' . The sheer complexity of influencing behaviour is also evident from the breadth of research and reviews fro m a wi de range of academic fields that can be brought to bear on the challenges, see Annex e one. The term 'W icked' in this context is used, not in the sense of evil, or doing harm, rather Rittel and Webber used this description to encapsulate the large number of social challenges and planning problems that cannot be successfully treated with traditional linear, analytical approaches and simple informational or legislative responses . Rittel and Webber used the label; 'Wicked P roblems' to describe these challen ges and contrasted them with 'Tame P roblems '. 'Tame problems ' are not necessarily simple \u2014they can be very technically complex \u2014but the problem can be tightly defined and a solution fairly readily identified or worked through based on a limited number of v ariables that can be controlled and models of cause and effect . Solutions are primarily developed based on natural science and or engineering solutions that can be empirically developed and monitored . 'Wicked problems ' unlike 'T ame problems ' are more complex, difficult to define and often involve many variables . The nature and extent of the problem also depends on who has been asked to define it and possible solutions. D ifferent stakeholders often have different interpretations of what the problem is and how to deal with it and in what priority order . Often, each version of the problem has an element of truth \u2014no one version is complete or verifiably right or wrong. The debate concerning the causes, the extent and scale of the threat and the priority ass igned to potential solutions are all debatable amongst stakeholders and the public . Clearly t he field of public health prevention in relation to outbreaks contains some elements of 'Tame problems ' in as much as there is a great deal of sc ience based tech nical understanding about issues such as vaccine development and immunisation how ever, because there are many stakeholders with differing views about how the issue is best tackled they can also be labelled as ' Wicked P roblems '. Rittel and Webber set out th e following characteristics of 'wicked problems ' 44 43 Rittel, Horst, and Melvin Webber; \"Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning,\" pp. 155-169, Policy Sciences, Vol. 4, Elsevier Scientific Publishing C ompany, Inc., Amsterdam, 1973. Re printed in N Cross (ed.), Developments in Design Methodology, J. Wiley & Sons, Chichester, 1984, pp. 135-144.] 44 Tackling 'Wicked Problems' A Public Policy Perspective Australian Government. The Australian Public Service Commission. 18 'Wicked problems ' have many inter -dependencies and are often multi -causal . There are also often internally conflicting goals or objectives within the broader 'wicked problem '. It is the interdependencies, multiple causes and internally conflicting goals of 'wicked problems ' that make them hard to clearly define. The disagreement among stakeholders often reflects the different emphasis they place on the various causal factors. Successfully addressing wicked policy problems usually involves a range of co -ordinated and interrel ated responses, given their multi -causal nature; it also often involves trade -offs between conflicting goals. Attempts to address 'Wicked problems ' often lead to unforeseen consequences . Because wicked policy problems are multi -causal with many interconne ctions to other issues, it is often the case that measures introduced to address the problem lead to unforeseen consequences elsewhere. Some of these consequences may well be deleterious. It has been asserted, for example, that the success of policies desi gned to reduce atmospheric pollution in the USA and Western Europe may be partly responsible for an apparent increase in global warming due to the impact of a reduction in sulphur particles in the atmosphere on the formation of clouds that trap heat in the atmosphere.45 'Wicked problems ' are often not stable . Frequently, a 'wicked problem ' and the constraints or evidence involved in understanding the problem (e.g. legislation, scientific evidence, resources, political alliances) are evolving at the same ti me that policy makers are trying to address the policy problem. Policy makers have to focus on a moving target. 'Wicked problems ' usually have no clear solution . Since there is no definitive, stable problem there is often no definitive solution to wicked problems. Problem -solving often ends when deadlines are met, or as dictated by other resource constraints rather than when the 'correct' solution is identified. S olutions to 'wicked problems ' are not verifiably right or wrong but rather better or worse or good enough. To pursue approaches based on 'solving' or 'fixing' may cause policy makers to act on unwarranted and unsafe assumptions and create unrealistic expec tations. In such cases, it may be more useful to consider how such problems can be best managed . 'Wicked problems ' are socially complex . It is a key conclusion of the literature around wicked problems that the social complexity of wicked problems, rather than their technical Complexity overwhelms most current problem -solving and project management approaches. Solutions to 'wicked problems ' usually involve co -ordinated ac tion by a range of stakeholders , including organisations (government agencies at the federal, state and local levels), non -profit organisations, private businesses and individuals. 'Wicked problems ' hardly ever sit conveniently within the responsibility of any one organisation . Even if the soluti on to achieving safer communities is opaque, it is clear that it involves organisations beyond the police. It is also clear, for example, that environmental issues cannot be dealt with at any one level of government. They require action at every level \u2014 from the international to the local \u2014as well as action by the private and community sectors and individuals. 'Wicked problems ' involve changing behaviour . The solution too many \"wicked problems \" involve s changing the behaviour and/or gaining the commitment of individual citizens. The range of traditional levers used to influence citizen behav iour\u2014legislation, 45 2 Discussed in L. Briggs and R. Fisher, 'Fashions and Fads in Public Sector Reform' (Paper prepared for the CAPAM Conference, Sydney, October 2006), p. 18. 19 fines, taxes and other sanctions is often part of the solution but these may not be sufficient. More innovative, personalis ed approaches are likely to be necessary to motivate individuals to actively co-operate in achieving sustained behavioural change. In addition to these characteristics the ca se is made by Rittel and Webber that 'wicked problems ' can only be tackled if a full range of stakeholders are engaged in both defining the problem and the search for and delivery of solutions. Critically for pandemics and the associated public health management , public an d professional engagement is critical because the active participation and co -operation of cit izens and staff are required to deliver effective interventions. A further complexity co mes from bringing about changes in the way people behave, cannot readily be imposed, in advanced democracies for reasons of ethics and public acceptability in terms of fundamental civic rights and respect for personal freedoms . We also know that b ehaviours are also more likely to change if issues such as risk and how to behave to reduce risk s are widely understood, and owned by the people whose behaviou r is being target ed. Solving a 'wicked problem ' is fundamentally a social process. A starting point is stakeholder and citizen engagement. The OECD 46 identifies three levels of government -citizen relations in this context: Information . Government disseminates information on policy making or programme Design and information flows from the government to citizens in a one -way relationship. Consultation . Government asks for and receives feedback from citizens on policy -making and programme design. In order to r eceive feedback, government defines whose views are sought and on what issues. Receiving citizens' feedback also requires government to provide information to citizens beforehand. Consultation thus creates a limited two -way relationship between government and citizens. Active participation or citizen engagement . This occurs where citizens actively engage in policy and decision -making processes. Citizens may propose policy options and engage in debate on the relative merits of various options, although t he final responsibility for policy formulation and regulation rests with the government. Engaging citizens in policy making and programme design is an advanced two - way relationship between government and citizens based on the principle of partnership. The OECD also endorses some basic principles as set out by Canada's Institute on Governance 47 upon which active participation (or citizen engage ment) is based. These include: Shared agenda -setting for all participants A relaxed time -frame for deliberation An emphasis on value-sharing rather than debate Consultative practices based on inclusivene ss, courtesy and respect . Successfu lly addressing 'wicked problems ' often requires achieving sustained changes 46 OECD 2001, Citizens as Partners: Information, Consultation and Public Participation in Policy -Making , OECD, Paris, pp. 23, 24, 28. 47 Institute on Governance 1998, A Voice for All: Engagi ng Canadians for Change (Report (including Summary of Findings) of the Conference on Citizen Engagement, Ottawa, 27 -28 October), p. 25 http://www.iog.ca/publications/cereport.pdf 20 in behaviour. H uman behaviour is also often influence d by a complex web of fact ors. Influencing behaviour is a multi -faceted field of study and application that draws on a wide range of disciplines , research an d experience. The effectiveness of traditional policy and public heal th approaches to influencing b ehaviour (e.g. legislation, sanctions, regulations, taxes, subsidies, incentives and the provision of health care and preventive interventions such as vaccination) may be limited, without additional tools and understanding of how to engage citizens and hea lth sector staff in developing co-operative behavioural change. A key further behavio ural challenge related to this po int is how to achieve shared understanding and inter agency co -operation and co -ordination amongst the many organisations and staff groups from international through to local service delivery level. Co - operation with other sectors such as the media and civic planning and emergency services is also a large communication, engagement and behavioural challenge . A number of governments are now a ctively looking at emerging findings from the field of behavio ural influence and understanding to augment traditional policy tools used to influence behaviour. Many governments have a growing polic y interest in engaging citizens to achieve sustained behavi oural change to assis t in tackling 'wicked problems '. For example t he UK Government established in 2010 a 'Behavio ural Insigh t Team ' led by the Cabinet Offic e focused on developing new approaches to p olicy delivery based on insights and em erging research f rom fiel ds such as behavioural economics, evolutionary biology, social psychology and design thinking. The purpose of this unit is to: Exchange experience of behavioural change policies and their implementation Pool research and policy evaluation on behavioural change Disseminate research findings and good practice across government Advise on and promote common policy tools and support for those engaged in behaviour focused policies. In a similar man ner the Australian Public Service Commission has recently published a discussion paper, Changing Behaviour: A Public Policy Perspective 48 that outlines the key theories and empirical evidence about behavioural change and draws out the implications for improving policy making and programme implementation. The US government has engaged the Authors of the popular book 'Nudge'49 to act as advisors on several policy areas. The Canadian Government has also been actively interested in the area of behavioural change and has produced a set of guidelines known as the 'Tools of Change' for altering public behaviour around 'wicked problems ' in the environmental and health areas. These guidelines can be found at <http://www.toolsofchange.com>. What is clear is that given the complex nature of both public health policy making when dealing with 'wicked p roblems ' and the complexity involved in both understanding and developing progra mmes that can achieve positive civic behavioural change to assist in tackling a 'wicked problem ' a basic understanding i s required of key determinants of behaviour and what is known about how to influence it. 48 Australian Public Service Commission 2007, Changing Behaviour: A Public Policy Perspective http://www.apsc.gov.au 49 Thaler R and Sunstein C.

Communication and behaviour change in relation to pandemic influenza aims to make a contribution to overall efforts to help people overcome fear, anxiety and reduce feelings of vulnerability 50It can also assist people to make informed decisions and ultimat ely save lives51. It also has a broader contribution to managing potential political instability and economi c impacts that may follow on fro m a sever e outbreak 52. Regardless of how pandemic events are conceived what is clear is that the communication and b ehavio ural challeng es associated with managing out breaks and minimising harm are considerable due to the wide range of information issues that need to be addressed and the equally wide range of behaviours amongst different target groups that need to be influenced and the shifting nature of both information and behavio ural change programme during differing phases of an outbreak. The following list of factors all need to be addressed: Essential information developed, transmission and understood across all phases of an event Behaviours specified, communicated and acted on across all phases of an event Target audiences identified and targeted (Organisational, sectors, professional and citizen audiences) across all phases of an event Diagram 1 from the US AID planning strategic behaviour change communication for pande mic influenza guidance document 53 sets out the range of types of communication and relevant target groups that need to be involved with developing and delivering a planned response.

US AID AI COM 2009 . 22 Diagram 2 taken from WHO and UNICEF guidance54 indicates the need for a shifting tone of communication during different phases of an outbreak. Depending on the severity of the outbreak there would also need to be a change in the behavio ural goals of a programme. A review completed as part of the wider E -Com programme has reinforced the need for a flexible approach to communication over the phases of an outbreak. The review 55 found that public perceptions and behaviours evolved during the course of the 2009 pandemic. In most countries, perceived severity and anxiety declined, but perceived vulnerability increased. High levels of perceived self -efficacy and intention to ta ke pr eventive measures were observed. Improved hygienic practice and social distancing was practiced most commonly, but vaccination acceptance remained low in most countr ies. Marked regional differences were also noted. A review by Bish and Michie 56 has also highlighted that demographic and attit udinal factors can have a big i nfluence on the adoption of protective behaviour during a pandemic. Being older, female and more educated, or non -white, is associated with a higher chance of adopting the behaviours. \" There is evidence that greater levels of perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of the diseases and greater belief in the effectiveness of recommended behaviours to protect against the disease are important predictors of behaviour. There is als o evidence that greater levels of state anxiety (i.e. anxiety felt at that moment), and greater trust in authorities are associated with an increased chance of behaviour being carried out\". Findings such as this clearl y have major implications for commun ication and behaviour change strategy . For example, the need to adapt behavio ural influencing and communication programmes for specific groups of individuals, such as men, younger people, and the less 54 Behavioral interventions for reducing the transmission and impact of inf luenza A (H1N1) Virus Framework for Communication Strategies WHO /UNICEF 2009 55 Bults M, Beaujean D, Richardus J H, Voeten H.

The need to focus on perceptions of risk in communications as susceptibility is a key factor in decis ions to act. In this respect a certain level of perceived susceptibility is required to get people to take action and therefore interventions aimed at increasing this sense of risk appear to be w ell founded. However , ethically interventions designed to emphasis perceptions of risk should also be combined as Bish and Michie say with \"advice as to how the perceived threat can be lessened; for example, by emphasising that risk can be reduced by carr ying out the recommended protective actions and providing information about the efficacy of such measures in reducing risk\" It is therefore necessary to develop sets of communications guidance with specific objectives related to each identifiable target group at each stage of an outbreak . A complex planning task is possible to de velop such comprehensive plans, for example the WHO & PAHO staged guidance 57 and guidance from AED58 While all strategies will need to focus on communication and behaviour chang e activities needed during an outbreak, preparation is also needed to ensure that these activities take place in a co -ordinated and planned way with actions delivered over other phases of an outbreak for example actions in the pre -pandemic preparedness pha se such as briefing of key influencers and developing strong partnerships with the private and media sectors. Additional modified communication is al so likely to be needed between 'waves' of local outbreaks. It is also necessary to develop and set out cl ear behavio ural objectives related to both general population level behavio ur and specific sub group behaviours. With regard to the public WHO59 recommends that the key population level behaviours that need to be influenced in addition to uptake of vaccine, when offered include: Keep at least 1 metre distance from people who show symptoms of influenza -like illness . Reduce the time spent in crowded settings . Improve airflow in living spaces by opening windows . Avoid touching mouth, nose and eyes if possibl e. Clean hands thoroughly with soap and water or with an alcohol -based hand rub on a regular basis. Further more specific behavio ural goals have been spelled out by WHO and UNICEF60 with regard to public reduction of transmission. 57 Creating a Communication Strategy for Pandemic Influenza .

Behavioural Goal: Protect care givers and other members from infection. Aid recovery from illness Behaviours: Give sick people a separate space at home Assign a single care giver to a sick person Give ple nty of fluids to the sick p erson Recog nise signs and seek prompt care This set of behaviours are challenging in that they represent a set of potentially difficult set of changes for many to achieve. Each of these stated behaviours in fact also consists of a cluster of distinct sub behaviours that will need to be influenced. In addition, each behaviour may require distinct interventions that need to be delivered in targeted and tai lored ways to differing segments of the population. The challenge of vaccine uptake also represents a cluster of behavio ural challenges. The delivery of an effective vaccination campaign involves a co -ordinated response fro m a range of different stakehol ders. Communicatio n programmes play a crucial role in informing the stakeholders about a pandemic and about the vaccine and its benefits. Information alone will probably not however , be sufficient to ensure the successful distribution and uptake of the vaccine among the priority groups. As stated by WHO61 \"For people to make informed decisions about preventive and risk reduction practices, including taking the vaccine, a more integrated approach is needed - focusing on achieving behavio ural results. This is why this proposed strategy includes elements of both risk communications (often done through the media) and social mobilization1 (using multiple communications means and methods to influ ence, persuade, convince individuals and groups to take action)\". Different stakeholder groups will need different communication, engagement and behavio ural change programmes. For example, a mass media campaign can be an efficient way to inform a population about dangers, but it is probably not a good way to give techni cal information about how to administer the vaccine. There are obviously numerous specific target groups and sets of behaviours that need to be influenced, for example in relation to people planning or needing to travel 62. 61 Integrated C ommunication Strategy for Distribution of H1N1 vaccine Developed by WHO/H1N1 Communications Team and Societal and Individual Measures Team in consultation with Regions and partners. 2010 62 USAID W orkplace guide to Managers Avian Flu. USAID Avian Influenza Program by the Academy for Educational Development. 2 010 25 As described above the behavio ural and communications challenges posed by pandemic even ts are considerable and complex. This complexity necessitates the need for the development of integrated community wide communication and behavio ur change programmes. The N eed for Integrated and E viden ce Based Community Wide Strategies Any communication programme that is developed will involves a range of different actors and stakeholders, from those directly involved in and to those who play a supporting role. Information and mass media campaigns play a crucial role in informing these different stakeholders about pandemics and about the vaccines and there benefits. This will, however, as discussed previously probably not be sufficient to ensure the successful uptake of recommended behaviours or th e optimal distribution and uptake of the vaccine among the priority groups. For people to make informed decisions about preventive and risk reduction practices, including taking the vaccine, a more integrated approach is needed - focusing on achieving clea r behavio ural goals. A communication strategy and a behaviour influence strategy are important planning and imple mentation tools, which describe how to reach a defined set of measurable objectives. In addition to the principles and goal s set out above the central focus is on influencing human behaviour, so that people carry out appropriate actions to protect themselves from becoming infected and from infecting others. 63 These can be defined as: 1. Explaining a new virus and its risks to a wide audience . 2. Explaining the vaccine, assuring the public that it is safe . 3. Communicating when and where vaccine is available, and to whom . 4. Managing over -demand and under -demand for the vaccine . 5. Addressing health -care workers' concerns . 6. Addressing concerns from other target groups, particularly pregnant women . 7. Managing adverse events . 8. Managing trust in institutions . Within this shifting context, the communication and behaviour change challenges posed by pandemic events should according to WHO be focused on five key communication action areas .64 (a) Mobilizing administrative structures/advocacy/mass media . (b) Mobilizing communities . (c) Interpersonal communication/personal selling . (d) Promotional material and advertising . (e) Point -of-service promotion . 63 Integrated communication strategy for distribution of H1N1 vaccine Developed by WHO/H1N1 Communications Team and Societal and Individual Measures Team in consultation with Regions and partners February 2010 64 WHO communication -for-Behavioural -Impact: 2010. 26 In addition to these five key communication areas there are many guidelines for developing behavioural change interventions in the context of H1N165. The majority of these guidance documents articulate the need for communication and behaviour change programmes that reflect the reality of a complex set of stakeholders, potential target audiences, a variety of behaviours to be influenced and the dynamic and changing nature of pandemic events where understanding and threat levels will shift over time. WHO have set out further guidance relating to gen eral communications objectives for a pandemic influenza response66 1.

These guides for communication and behavio ural influence recognise that communication cannot be a stand -alone intervention when addr essing a public health concern such as reducing transmission of influenza because of the strong sociocultural influences on behaviours and the influence on behaviour of other areas of policy such as the availability and access to vaccination and other well -being programmes and health service provision. The general approach to behaviour chang e has changed in recent years fro m one focused on paternalistic information transmission to one that is more characterised by making communications more of an inclusive and horizontal process in which both senders and receivers of information take on interchangeable roles, throu gh a process that involves out- reach on the part of institutions and active engagement on the part of citizens. Communication has changed its focu s from \"persuasion\" to what has been called \"participatory communication\" 67 where information is created and shared between participants to reach a mutual understanding and collective decision -making. This kind of approach seeks to examine and address pr edisposing, enabling and reinforcing factors associated with behavioural change which also includes, in addition to addressing cultural values and beliefs, government policies and legislations, partnership building, resource mobilization and generating evi dence of the effectiveness of the approach through research, monitoring and evaluation. As discussed above the timing of communication is also a key issue to be considered. Messages can be most effective when the public feel that they have been involved. However, the time to explain complex issues such as antiviral efficacy or vaccine prioritisation is not best delivered during an emergency situation but 65 Creating a Communication Strategy for Pandemic Influenza .Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization . 2008. 66 Communication for Pandemic Influenza Response.

WHO Office South East Asia. 2008. 27 rather it should be built i nto action in the preparation periods when there is ample time to develop li stening and engagement elements of programmes. With regard to the state of the evidence about how to develop and deliver the most effective communication and behavio ural influence strategies the UK Department of health scientific review of principles of effective communication68 recommends the following plannin g principles be adhered to : Openness/Transparency -be open about: Likely course of incident . How incident is being handled . What people can do to protect themselves . Clear and simple communication : Ensure new terms are explained . Be sensitive to cultural differences . Ensure messages are scientifically accurate . Acknowledge uncertainty : Acknowledge that the course of the pandemic is uncertain . Ensure messages from different sources are consistent . The guidance also focuses on the general issue of communicating about risk The report concludes that the representation of risk information is import ant as it can affect whether or not action will be taken . The repor t sets out a number of 'golden rules' apply ing to communicating about risk. The Golden rules are : Always give absolute as well as relative risk. For example, 'Pregnant women are four times as likely to develop complications from swine flu as non -pregnant women. Of 1,000 pregnant women n would develop complications whereas of 1,000 non - pregnant women n would develop complications'. Present messages about risk using natural frequencies (e.g. out of 100 people 10 will experience side effects) as opposed to probability frames (the risk of experiencing side effects is 10%). Frame ambiguous messages about risk negatively. For exampl e \"it is estimated that out of every 100 people 20 to 30 will contract swine flu\" (as opposed to saying \"out of every 100 people 70 to 80 will not contract swine flu\"). Present risk information visually as well as textually whenever possible. The cha nge in emphasis from paternalistic expert information transmission and the acceptance that it is more effective to adopt a balanced and open approach to communication risk is partly driven by research that indicates that trust is a key element in complianc e with recommended behavioural adoption and that trust can be fostered by both open communication but also by the 68 Bish A, Mich ie S. Yardley L. Principles of Effective C ommunication Scientific Evidence Base Review. The Departmen t of Health. Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee (SPI). Department of Health.2010. 28 active engagement of target abundance groups in the design , development , implementation and evaluation of change programmes. The Role of Trust in State and Citizen Driven C ommunication One thing is clear the only certainty is that future influenza pandemics will happen and they will be unpredictable 69 Slovic70has shown that trust is a key emotion associated with responses to risk related b ehaviour. Slovic also points out that trust is fragile and difficult to maintain, being easily broken because negative events, which can destroy trust, are more noticeable than positive events and as Bish and Michie71 state: \"Levels of trust and satisfaction with communication are particularly important in a pandemic situation in that the authorities are responsible for providing information about the course of the outbreak and also for developing treatments and vaccinations. Lack of trust can therefore have very detrimental effects in terms of controlling the disease.\" Low trust in the organisations responsible for communication during a pandemic will have a big impact on ho w people react to messages and advice about how to behave. Lack of trust is also likely to increase concern and to interfere with the way that the risk messages are interpreted and acted on72 73. It has been found74 that during the 2009 outbreak of swine flu that trust in authority was associated with reported avoidance behaviour s, such as avoiding crowds and public transport. Research has also found that older adults with greater trust in authorities to contain the spread of SARS were more likely to adopt precautionary behaviours75. Issues of trust can be especially important in situations which are uncertain, such as how the course of a pandemic will develop. With regard to vaccine acceptance Larson76 et al endorse these findings and make the point that peoples decision making related to vaccine acceptance is driven not just by sc ientific or economic evidence, but by a mix of psychological, sociocultural, and political factors, all of which need to be understood and taken into account by policy and other decision makers. \"Public trust in vaccines is highly variable and building t rust depends on understanding perceptions of vaccines and vaccine risks, historical experiences, religious or political affiliations, and socioeconomic status. Although provision of accurate, scientifically based evidence on the risk -benefit ratios of vacc ines is crucial, it is not enough to redress the gap 69 Fineberg Preview of the Report of the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) and on pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 March 2011. http://www . who.int/ihr/preview_report_review_committee_mar2011_en.pdf. 70 Slovic, P.

New Decade of Vaccines 5 Addressing the vaccine confidence gap Published Online June 9, 2011 DOI:10.1016/S0140 - 6736(11)60678 -8 29 between current levels of public confidence in vaccines and levels of trust needed to ensure adequate and sustained vaccine coverage\" Bults77 et al addressing the issue of building trust recommend that health authorities regularly provide information on outbreaks, communicate certainties and uncertainties, and maintain transparent decision -making to instruct and motivate the public to take measures. They believ e that this will help to build public trust in health authorities and prevent misconceptions. The y also believe that risk communications should be tailored to regional, cultural, and societal conditions. Larson et all advocate more research on individual determinants of public trust, and on what mix of factors are most likely to sustain public trust as they believe that there has been a lack of quality and rigor in much of the research which focuses on understanding the psychological, so cial and political factors that affect public trust in vaccines. According to Larson et al key trust issues related to the development of more effective communication and behavio ural influencing strategy , include the need to address the following conclusions: Public concerns about vaccines are not merely about vaccine safety, but are also about vaccine policies and recommendations, vaccine costs, and new research findings. Public decision making related to vaccine acceptance is complex and is neither driven by scientific nor economic evidence alone, but is also driven by a mix of scientific, psychological, sociocultural, and political reasons, all of which need to be better understood. Although communic ation of positive, evidence -based information about the safety of specific vaccines and their benefit -risk ratios to the public is crucial, communication alone will not stop public distrust and dissent against vaccines. Levels of public trust in vaccines are highly variable and context specific. To sustain or restore confidence in vaccines, a thorough understanding is needed of the Population' s\u2014or subpopulation's \u2014specific vaccine concerns, historical experiences, religious or political affiliation, and soc ioeconomic status. Core principles to be followed by all health providers, experts, health authorities, policy makers and politicians include: engagement with and listening to stakeholders, being transparent about decision making, and being honest and ope n about uncertainty and risks. Larson et al also make the point that in a rapidly developing technological and information sharing rich world the internet and other new forms of social media and social networking have not only allowed for rapid and ubiqui tous sharing of information \u2014and misinformation \u2014 but have also allowed new methods of self -organisation and empowerment among online communities to develop rapidly. Some of these communities have and will continue to challenge the information and advice for mulated by statutory and professional public health organisations. 77 Bults M, Beaujean D, Richardus J H, Voeten H. Perceptions and behavioral responses of the general public during the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic: a systematic review (In Press) 2012. 30 These new non -hierarchical, dialogue based communication systems are not unique to pandemic events , but part of a broader environment of increasing public questioning and the emergence of dissent groups, particularly in areas that include risks such as climate change and many areas of public health and information openness. The internet, social media, mobile phone and smart phone networks have shifted the methods and speed of communication substantially. This new technology is enabling information about pandemics and immunisation to be gathered, analysed and commented on by f ar more people far faster. The amount of information available has increased greatly, including scientifically valid data and evidence -based recommendations alongside a lot of poor quality data, personal opinions, and misinformation pu t about by particular interest groups. The extent of the Internet' s direct impact on people's health decision making 78 is still low, but rising . Especially the amount of interactive use of the Internet is increasing, e.g. due to the use of social media. It is argued that the fact that individuals do not report the Internet to be an important source of information does not necessarily mean that the information obtained in their Internet searches is not influential in their decisions. A study 'e -health Trends in Europe' investi gated who searches on the Internet for health - related information, how often and how. Two independent surveys, separated by an interval of 18 months, were conducted in 2005 and 2007 with representative samples (N=14,956) from seven European countries: Denm ark, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Norway, Poland, and Portugal. The results revealed an increase in this time period from 42% to 52% of the population who surf the Internet for health information79. There is a tendency towards a more interactive use of inform ation especially among 'digital natives' (i.e. those who grew up with the Internet). However, it is also striking that in comparison to other available information the Internet is perceived to have a very low importance for health decisions. However , the most important source of trusted information is health professionals, followed by conventional media. However , the fact that individuals report that they do not consider the Internet to be an important source does not necessarily mean that the informati on obtained in their frequent Internet searches does not influence their decisions. In this section we have briefly reviewed the behavio ural challenges pose d by pandemic events. These challenges relate to the probable changing risk profile of an event, th e need for multiple stakeholders including citizens to trust and be engaged in programmes designed to reduce risk and harm and fro m the multiple potential behaviours that authorities and communities are seek ing to influence during a pandemic event. There i s also a fundamental tension between communication programmes aimed at raising knowledge levels and attitudes and beliefs and programmes aimed at influencing behaviour. The next section reviews some of the limitations of programmes exclusively focused on i nformation transmission. Conclusions A number of lessons can be drawn from the papers reviewed in this section. Co -ordination of international, national and local communication and marketing efforts in a planned and proactive way needs be established as an integral part of any preparedness programme. 78 Betsch C. Innovations in communication: the Internet and the psychology of vaccination decisions. Euro Rasmussen J, Santana S, et al. e Health Trends in Europe 2005 -2007: A Population -Based Survey. J Med Internet Res. 2008;10(4):e42. 31 Given the multiple behaviours and audiences a comprehensive strategy will also be required to build and sustain trust amongst the public. Communication consistency is also required and information needs to be deliver ed in a timely and on -going way to advise people of shifts in risks and new resulting recommendations. There is also a need for both a rationale set of suggested actions based on the best available science to be offered to accompany every commun ication explaining to people why they are being asked to change their behaviour. However , communication programmes also need to include recognition of non -rational decision making and influencing factors. These factors will also need to be taken into accou nt in any programme designed to influence attitudes and behaviour given what is known about non rational choice, this issue is explored more fully in subsequent sections of this paper. In developing any communication or behavioural programme a further ch allenge will be a need to not only translate but also to customise educational material and other approaches to influencing behavio ur to reflect the social and cultural norms of given populations. Clearly material should be pre -tested prior to use to asses s acceptability and impact. Given the range and complexity of the many stakeholders and potential community influencers, stakeholders and other appropriate community leaders and influencers including the media should be included in the planning, implement ation and evaluation of programmes. The use of key opinion leaders and other influential people can also potentially assist communication efforts. With regard to the selection of the best communication channels a key challenge is to identify both those ch annels that people use and trust but also those channels that are the most cost effective. As well as developing message and influencing strategies that people trust a further challenge will be to identify key barriers and competitive forces that exert counter views and influence to those expressed by governments and experts or that simply represent real economic, physical or time barriers that get in the way of recommend action. Action to reduce the impact of these counter forces , barriers and blocks will also need to be built into programme design. WHO recommend 80 four steps that should be put in place to further enhan ce communication and influence strategies. These four macro policy recommendations with regard to communication and behavioural influence represent a good checklist for those responsible for enhancing programme design and delivery. 1. It is advisable to create a framework for evaluating the effecti veness of the various measures and to make a greater effort to understand community issues. 2. To enhance the sustainability and impact of the measures, linking behavioural interventions to those used in other existing program mes and with other diseases is i mportant. This linkage should be at country level and spread across all UN agencies. 3. There is a need for a communication framework and associated tools to be used at the national level along with implementation capacities suited to each level. 4. There is a general need to strengthen risk communication skills in key responding staff. Given the key challenges associated with implementing and managing communication and behavioural influencing programmes set out in this section of the paper and the proceeding sections, the following proto tool sets out a checklist that those responsible for designing and managing effective programmes c an use to check that all the maj or elements of what should constitute an effective approach are in place. 80 Public health measures dur ing the influenza. A(H1N1)2009 P andemic. Meeting Report. WHO Technical Consultation. Gammarth, Tunisia 26 28 October 2010 32 Proto Tool 1 Adopting a Goals and SMART Objectives Approach to Specifying Specific Behavioural Target s in Pandemic Communication and Marketing Programmes. This proto tool se ts out an approach for establishing what specific behaviours will be the focus of an intervention programme or campaign. The term 'behaviour change' is widely used and while a useful short hand for discussions about ways to influence behaviour, it can constr ict and does not adequately describe the range of issues that need to be considered. Often the target is not to 'change' a behaviour but to find ways to: encourage the adoption and establishment of helpful and positive behaviour; and or how to avoid the ad option and establishment of harmful or problematic behaviour. The approach set out in this proto tool starts by recognising that behaviour is inherently 'dynamic' , i.e. behaviour is not a fixed state or static, but changes overtime. Behaviour is inherently 'dynamic' i .e. subject to variation and is often not an isolated single action, but part of a pattern of actions over time' The approach set out in this proto tool starts with the development of a clear understanding of 'what' behaviour is occurring, a nd what different people know, think and feel about it. Before going on to analyse what theory or models that might help inform or develop insight into why people are adopting a behaviour and the potential insights that might provide ways for effect ively intervening. A focus on specifying precisely target behaviour s informs the development of a theoretical perspective rather than the other way round. As stated above t here can be a tendency with traditional 'behaviour change' approach to focus speci fically on the 'problem behaviour' and what can be perceived as 'problem people', and to concentrate on trying to get them to change. A key consideration is to u nderstand what range of factors are influencing both the positive and the problematic behaviour s. Establishing B ehavio ural Goals and SMART O bjectives The task is to be able to describe the issue being addressed in terms of specific behaviours both those behaviours that are problematic and those that are positive and need to be encouraged . This will help ensure that the methods or interventions used can be geared to addre ssing the specific behaviours with specific target groups. Behavio ural goals are overarching aims or statements of intent, behavio ural objectives are more specific and should ideally be able to be expressed in SMART form (SMART ; Specific , Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound) and also expressed in terms of the focus of the objective: Cognitive, ( Knowledge, and understanding) Affective ( Emotional , beliefs and attitudes) or Psychomotor (Physical doing observable actions) The following checklist sets out a number of issues that need to be considered for both positive behaviours and problematic behaviours 33 Defining Beha viour and S etting SMART Objectives Proto Tool An AIM is: A broad strategic purpose of a project, AIMS can be long term, medium term or short term. An Objective is: A specific , measurable goal , whose achievement will contribute towards the aim. 1. Defining the problem : Think of your health problem as the gap between what should occur in your community and what is occurring, or the gap between an acceptable/desirable health status and the current status. Problem definition statement : 2. What is the aim of the intervention? 3. Objectives can be focused on three different issues : - Affective objectives, focused on feelings . - Cognitive objectives, focused on learning . - Psychomotor objectives focused on doing or observable or reported behaviour . 4. Objectives should be set out in a SMART format. SMART stands for: - Specific: not open to different interpretations. - Measurable : - Achievable: with the resources that are available. - Reliable: durable and consistent data can be gathered . 34 - Time bound : can be measured within the time frame of the intervention . 5. Objectives must be specific and answer the following questions: What you are evaluating? What are you aiming to achieve? How will change be measured? Who is the intervention aimed at? Where is it taking place? What is its time scale? Who wil l deliver the intervention? E.g. The programme will increase the current attendance rate of 12% at the East Rd Vaccination Clinic by white middle class men aged 25 -35 from the Small Town area, to a rate of 15% by the end of December 2013. 6. Behavioural F easibility Assessment Use the fol lowing check list of questions to assess the likelihood of the desired behaviour being adopted : 1. Is the current behaviour seen as a problem? 2. How rewarding is the undesirable behaviour? 3. How costly is the current behaviour? 4. How complex is the behaviour (d oes it involve several elements)? 5. How frequently must the desired behaviour be performed? 6. How compatible is the desired behaviour with the target audience's behaviour? 7. Is the current behaviour approved of socially? 8. Are their major barriers to engaging with the desired behaviour? 9. What information does the audience need to perform the behaviour? 10. What skill does the audience need to perform the behaviour? 11. What resources does the audience need to perform the behaviour? 12. Are there some members of the segment who alre ady do the desired behaviour? 35 7. List the potential target audiences Primary audience (The key people you want to help change) Secondary audience (The people who you can help and who can help the primary audience) Tertiary or other audiences (Others who have influence on the primary and or secondary audiences) Primary Secondary Tertiary 8. Current B ehaviour Describe current problematic behaviour (Set out in specific and quantifiable terms the behaviour) List and describe related problematic behaviours . List and describe current beneficial behaviours to be maintained . 36 Specify the behavioural goals for each target group? Specify positive behaviours to be maintained, negative behaviours to be changed and new behaviours to be adopted. Positive behaviours to be maintained : Cognitive Affective Psychomotor Negative behaviours to be changed Cognitive Affective Psychomotor New behaviours to be adopted : Cognitive Affective Psychomotor Under each behaviour set out the specific behavio ural objectives that relate to that goal, (There may be several) for positive, negative and new behaviours . Specify how each behavioural objective can be expressed as a single specific observable behaviour and how it could be measured. Each behavio ural objective should be expressed in terms of a SMART objective. Positive behaviour objectives : Cognitive Affective Psychomotor 1 2 3 4 37 Negative behaviour objectives : Cognitive Affective Psychomotor 1 2 3 4 Etc: New behaviour objectives : Cognitive Affective Psychomotor 1 2 3 4 Etc: 38 \"European policy -makers and politicians are put in a hard place by the prospect of modern influenza pandemics. They don't know when one is going to happen, where it will start or what it will be like\"81 Limitations and Strengths of Communication Dominated Approaches to Influencing B ehaviour Traditional assumptions around commu nication and how people respond to information have in the past shaped much of the pandemic communication policy design and implementation. There has been and continues to be a great dea l of effort and guidance focusing on crafting messages and ensuring that they are tailored to the different stages of a pandemic event 82 83 84 85 or message based strategies fo cused on particular challenges such as understanding and use of vaccines86 87 . This situation is now changing and more effort is being put into widening the scope of informationa l campaigns as components of behaviour change programmes WHO/UNICEF 88 and additional guidance also exists about how to engage stakeholders and citizens in a more community focused approach to dealing with outbreaks89. However, in many countries and services the dominant focus continues to be on creating clear messages and consistent communication strategies . The scope of these communication efforts span a variety of audiences including the p ublic, professional and community members. Communicatio ns programmes are often seen to be supportive to other elements of the pandemic response . Using a communications dominated strategy for increasing awareness and knowledge transmissi on based on the belief that people will carry out recommended behaviours ha ving acquired accurate knowledge and assessed risk is 81 Nicoll A, Sprenger M .

This issue will be expanded in sections six and seven of this paper. There is however , a danger that some countries and public health authorities have relied too heavily on a purely informational campaign and awareness approach. The risk is that by focussing on only one approach we do not consider the full range of possible levers available to persuade the pub lic, inform them and trigger required behaviours. To fully understand how to influence behaviour, it is essential that we take a cross - disciplinary approach, using insights from a number of approaches to fully understand all the factors that influence peo ple's behaviour, this issue is dealt with in lat er sections of this paper. See A nnex e A that represents a sweep of this broad field of literature. Regardless of the relevant contribution and priority placed on information efforts it is clear that in any sc enario information and communicating with the public, professional and other influencers will have a key role to play and must be an integral part of any fully developed response. Therefore the purpose of this section of the paper is to draw together under standing and insights about the role of informational approaches and contributions to pandemic management prevention and care. This sector also introduces the first set of 'Proto Tools' focused on information use, to assist those responsible for planning and delivering information programmes. The evidence of effectiveness for health promotion interventions and behavioural interventions face two key challenges. The first is the methodological challenge of designing quality studies that can prove ca use and effect and control for extraneous variables. The second challenge is sustaining an intervention of sufficient duration and weight to create a population level effect in terms of not just knowledge gain or attitudinal change but also measurable behavio ural and physiological change. According to ECDC92 public health evidence for the effectiveness of interventions is generally weak. For example Thacker et al 93 reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to modify 194 potentially modifiable ri sk factors for 31 conditions of high priority for ECDC. Of the 702 population based interventions evidence for the preventable fa ctors were found for only 4.4% In a recent ECDC technical report94 an assessment was made of the type and strength of evidence for each of the 27 interventions reviewed. The grading of the evidence found that only 2 of the 27 vaccine studies reviewed were graded at A (Systematic review primary data and RCT) and 13 were graded at C (Case study reports and observational studies of p oor quality) Within the body of the report ECDC set out the essential processes for assessing the quality of the evidence at each of these stages of risk assessment and intervention consideration. 90 Noar S A ten year retrospective of research in health Mass Medis Campaigns; Where do we go from here?.

ECDC.2009 40 The report also sets out in the form of the AGREEII instrument (Appraisal of Guidance for research and evaluation) which is an international collaboration to assess public health guideline quality defined as 'confidence that the potential biases of guideli ne development have been addressed adequately and that the recommendations are both internally valid and are feasible for practice'. The AGREEII instrument sets out within its six domains suggested criteria for assessing the quality of guidance developed. In relation to the application of the AGREEII instrument in the field of communicable disease the report suggests that there are likely to be additional factors that need to be considered . A set of specific criteria for communicable disease guida nce develo pment are set out as: Communication the recommendations to patients, public and media. Consideration of delivery structures and mechanisms . Consideration of legal and regulatory frameworks . Role of ethics . Health economics . Trade -off between harms and ben efits. The AGREEII instrument is helpful in that it highlights the need to consider in a consistent way communication and behaviour change elements of communicable disease guidance development and communication. The guide lines specifically mention the need to consider diversity issues and issues of discrimination and the need to both assess and communicate potential costs of interventions and negative effects of programmes. The R ole of Information in Supporting Pandemic P reparedness As discussed in the proceeding section information and education are key element s in managing pandemic events and an integral part of the public health tool kit. Information programmes aimed at small groups, individuals and the whole population via the m ass media and dig ital media all have a role to play. Drawing on more generic work by Miller & Ware 95 the following check list suggests the range of contributions that informational programmes may contribute to public health interventions: 1. Information programmes can stim ulate lear ning and generate changes in understanding, beliefs attitudes and behaviour. 2. Information can influence t he general public conversation . The 'agenda setting' role of information is potentially one of its most p owerful and sustained impacts. Thro ugh sustained repetition informational programmes can produce long -term benefits by creating a climate of opinion, setting and or influencing the agenda for public discussion. 95 Miller, M. & Ware, J. 1989, Mass media alcohol and drug campaigns; consideration of relevant issues, Monograph Series No. 9, AGPS, Canberra 41 3. Informational programme s can assist with reinforcing positive existing beliefs , opinions and behaviours, it can also help clarify issues and clear up misunderstanding. 4. Mass media and digital information programmes can produce multiplier effects when combined with interpersonal communication efforts. 5. Community development and engagement programmes and stakeholder management programmes can be enhanced through rigorously developed and executed informational programmes. 6. Information programmes as integrated components of public health programmes can make a significant contribution to behavio ural change strategies as well as the achievement of information, attitude and knowledge programme goals. The potential contributions of informational programmes are however , often reduced by a series of factors and approaches to the planning and delivery of programmes. Many health information campaigns exhibit some or all of the following characteristics which have the potential to reduce their impact: Some campaigns are still constructed by experts with limited input from communities and stakeholders. This approach which is often driven by \"experts\" often does not undertake sufficient insight research into the attitudes, beliefs and behaviours of target groups with the result that the me ssages are often misunderstood or viewed as irrelevant by the people they are intended for. This approach often results in recipients filtering out messages, dismissing them or in extreme cases reacting in an opposite way to what is being recommended. . Many programme s are not sustained at a level of intensity of over long enough periods to gain audience awareness and acceptance. Timescales are often short - term with little baseline evidence for action and evaluation of the impact. Some campaigns ar e not adequately performance or programme managed. Much activity is focus ed around developing messages and selecting audience channels with the result that vital planning, insight and evaluation stages are neglected. There is a tendency to repeat publi c health information to the public in the same format/style instead of developing and refreshing the message over time so that it changes to meet the expect ations/needs of target groups. The result is that people are bored and the information is largely ig nored. Campaigns and other forms of information can be poorly co -ordinated so that contradictory messages or differences in interpretation of advice are picked up by the general media, this can add to confusion and char ges that authorities are being incon sistent in the advice they provide . 42 Some campaigns have either insufficiently specific objectives or have over ambitious objectives given the resource level available. Often programmes are insufficiently funded to achieve their goals . Many campaigns fai l to utilise a full intervention mix of education, design, support services and control measures in a co -ordinated and sustained way with informational programmes . In addition to these common planning and execution failings it is well established that in most circumstances the providing information, on its own often has limited impact on people's health behavio ur9697. This is because health behaviour is, as stated previously a complex issue that is determined by more than just an individual's level of knowledge . In most cases t he simple one way persuasive model of information influences has now been replaced by a more socially oriented approach, in which mass and digital media are viewed as one of many possible sources of information in society. Media sources cannot be discussed in isolation from personal information sources - families, friends and so on - which may support or contradict state sponsored communication. It is also clear that t he impact of informational messages can no longer be determined by content alone. Members of the intended target audience are now regarded by many people responsible for crafting public informational programmes as active participants in the communication process. This means that existing beliefs, attitudes, experiences, trust and knowledge all affect interpretation and acceptance or rejectio n of messages. The Evidence B ase With regard to generic evidence about the utility of informational and mass media campaigns the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has produced a number of guidance docu ments covering issues such as obesity 98, smoking (preventing children and young people taking up smoking99, physical activity 100, and programmes for attitude and behaviour change 101. In general terms the NICE reviews indicate that there is some good evidence that information camp aigns, coupled with other measure s can have a significant impact. Nice also found however , that many of the studies were of variable quality. Although some interventions have been fully evaluated many have not been, s ome evaluations were 96 Robertson R (2008) Using Information to Promote Healthy Behaviours. London: The King's Fund.

This makes it difficult to assess whether the observed impacts are attributable to the intervention or to o ther factors in the wider surrounding environment. A lot of the studies also originate in America so the findings and recommendations may not be transferable to a European setting. Also m any of the studies included mainly process focused outcome measures such as the number of phone calls to a 'quit smoking' line, rather than 'harder' behavioural outcome measures such as the number of smokers who were still not smoking after a defined time period. Many evaluations also measured short -term impacts only, and did not consider whether behaviour ch ange was sustained once the intervention or incentive finished. See annex A for further analysis of characteristics of effective programmes. Notwithstanding these study limitations according to the Kings Funds102 there is reasonable evidence that: \"information campaigns can encourage people to change their smoking, diet and exercise habits, though providing information seems to have more impact in changing knowledge and beliefs, than behaviour. However, media campaigns are most effective when they r un alongside other interventions \"103 104. With regard to the promotion of vaccination the CDC Meta evidence and economic review system 105 has undertaken a number of systematic reviews that include specific reviews of informational and educational intervention s. One programme focuses on targeted vaccination programmes106. Under this programme a specific review was undertaken to assess the utility of a community wide education programme approach107 . The findings of the task force were that there is: \"insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of using community -wide education when implemented alone in improving influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide, or hepatitis B vaccination coverage in high -risk adults because no studies qualified for review\". The re view series also found insufficient evidence to endorse expanded access in healthcare settings108, using client or family incentives when implemented alone in improving influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide, or hepatitis B vaccination coverage in high -risk adults109 and provider education when used alone110. However , the reviews did find that using a combination of interventions including community wide and targeted information approaches is supported by available evidence111. Lessons can also be drawn from interventions reviewed that focus on both universally available vaccines 112 and health communication reviews. With regard to universally targeted vaccines the following forms of intervention were recommend: 102 Commissioning and behaviour change.

CDC also found that there was insufficient evidence for clinic based education alone 121 provider based education alone122. CDC does however recommend an approach that uses multiple interventions in combination 123 such as: An intervention to enhance access to vaccination services (expanded access in healthcare settings, reduced c lient out -of-pocket costs) At least one provider - or syste m-based intervention (standing orders, provider reminder systems, provider assessment and feedback), and/or At least one intervention to increase client demand for vaccination (client reminders, client education) With regard to generic health communication s 124 based on the strength of current evidence CDC recommends125 the use of mass media and targeted communication programmes in the fields of: 113 http://www.thecommunityguide.org/vaccines/universally/homevisits.htm 114 http://www.thecommunityguide.org/vaccines/universally/clientoutofpocketcosts.html 115 http://www.thecommunityguide.org/healthcommunication/index.html 125 http://www.thecommunityguide.org/healthcommunication/index.html 45 Use of Child Safety Seats: Community wide Information and Enhanced Enforcement Campaigns .

Further evidence exists that reinforces the conclusions for the CDC reviews about the place and utility of informational and educational a pproaches as part of public health programmes 126 127 128 129. There is then a reasonable weight of evidence that under specific conditions well planned, targeted, well -executed health information campaigns can make a contribution to more comprehensive programmes but appear to have much less effect when delivered as a stand - alone response. If used in a co-ordinated and comprehensive way c ampaigns can have an impact on health knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours130. The scale and effect ive size of interventions is also a clear issue that needs to be considered. Whilst effective size may appear mo dest compared with the impact of some clinical interventions on individual patients, these campaign effects can translate into major public health impact given the wide reach of mass media. Such impact can only be achieved, however, if principles of effect ive campaign design are carefully followed. Snyder 126 Grol R, Grimshaw J (2003).

Cochrane Database Systems Review, Vol 3. 46 et al 131 Meta analysis of campaigns demonstrated that campaigns have been shown to have small measurable effects in the short -term. Campaign effect sizes vary by the type of behaviour: r=.15 for seat belt use, r=.13 for oral health, r=.09 for alcohol use reduction, r=.05 for heart disease prevention, r=.05 for smoking, r=.04 for mammography and cervical cancer screening, and r=.04 for sexual behaviours. However , campaigns with an additional enforcement (re gulatory) component were shown to be more effective than those without. The \"average\" campaign affected the i ntervention community by about five percentage points, and nutrition campaigns for fruit and vegetable consumption, fat intake, and breastfeeding, have been slightly more successful on average than for other health issues. There is also evidence of a dose -response relationship between campaign weight (dose) and impact (behavi our change); higher levels of exposure tend to lead to bigger changes in people's way of thinking and behaving 132 133 134 135 136 . A Cochrane Systematic review137 assessing the effects of mass media on the utilisation of health services also concluded that there is evidence that these strategies may have an important role in influencing the use of health care interventions; they should be considered as one of the t ools that may encourage the use of services. A review focussing on physical activity138 campaigns concluded that they should focus more on influencing short term features such as social norms, to bring about long -term behaviour change. Individual Approache s to Information T ransmission As well as mass media approaches to information transmission it is also clearly possible to design and deliver intervention s that are focused on small groups and individuals. Going beyond segmented approaches to mass media promotions into the field of personalised information provision is something that is being enabled on a more cost effective basis by digital communication channels. Tailoring information to individuals can also increase the impact of campaig ns. Tailoring involves collecting relevant information from individuals, then using this information to design the most effective message or intervention approach 139 for that type of person . 131 Snyder, L.

British Medical Journal, vol 327, pp E57 -8. 47 Personal tailoring of information is a relatively new method, an d therefore the evidence base is limited, however , a study of smokers in England found that tailored materials were useful in motivating those who did not want to quit or did not think they wanted to140. The Cochrane review of self -help interventions for s moking cessation also found 'some evidence for the effectiveness of tailored materials,'141 Interventions designed to increase an individual's understanding; motivation and confidence come in many forms. Examples of interventions based on individual support include: 142 Goal setting and action planning . Group support programmes . Buddy schemes . Coaching and counselling . Relaxation techniques . Stress management . Skills training . Motivational interviewing . Maintenance strategies to prevent relapse . Structured problem solving and cognitive rehearsal . Coping strategies. In the field of smoking cessation for example 143 it has been shown that a range of individualised solutions when combined delivered increased quit rates and attempts. A review by the C ochrane Collaboration supported these findings, stating that both individual counselling and group therapy increased people's chances of quitting 144. This typ e of support is now widely used in many public health programmes. As stated above , digital media is enabling mass personalisation and tailored support on a mass scale to be offered. This form of intervention is often labelled 'Mass Personalisation\". Examples include the NHS LifeCheck,145 system which provides personalised information and practical advic e based on answers given in a health assess ment questionnaire. Personalised support can also be delivered by a range of professionals or indeed by trained lay workers face to face or via the use of telephone -services . NHS direct is an example of this kind of personalised information service146. A further development of this kind of personalised information and support service is called 'Health Coaching' which is discussed further in secti on seven of this paper as it often goes beyond information into the aren a of personalised behavio ural change planning. 140 Gilbert H, Nazareth I, Sutton S, Morris R, Godfrey C (2008).

The new media revolution which is characterised by a more democratic control of information channels and a blurring between what is con ceived to be expert and non -expert opinion together with a blurring of production and consumption of information and entertainment , has fundamentally changed the communication and influencing environment in which those responsible for pandemic communicatio n operate. This development driven by more connected communities and easy access to content production and viral spread of information has shif ted fundamentally the process from top - down, one way expert -to-citizen (ver tical) communication system to a l ess hierarchical, and more interactive(horizontal) communication system. Given the new technology and increasing to the point of almost universal access citizens and small groups of like minded advocates are increasingly questioning recommendations of expe rts and public institutions on the basis of their own, often web informed views. This si tuation is clearly not an issue limited to public health but one that reaches into all aspects of civic life and one that is changing the relationship between the s tate, figures of authority, experts and the general population. The technology and its instantaneous nature which allows interactive exchange between many users and the coming together of mobile and always connected services have shifted the methods and speed of communication substantially, allowing information about public health issues including pandemic events to be gathered, analysed, and commented on at such a pace that traditional approaches to media management and briefing during pandemic events can ea sily be left behind or left struggling to react to a rapidly evolving communication and opinion forming in this new democratised media environment. Traditional print and broadcast media are however , still important and in many cases the most important s ources of information news and public agenda setting. This fact together with the increasing integration between traditional and new media channels hosted by large media service providers and corporations means that there is still a great deal of scope and in many ways an even more effective and targeted way to use information approaches to influence opinion and public behaviour. This clearly means that those responsible for media and communication prog rammes in the public health fiel d need to develop strat egies that take account of new media opportunities in the fields of opinion setting, information distribution and market research. The field of E -health\" (An element of new communication technologies) is growing rapidly and represents the use of emerging information and communication technology to improve or enable health and health care. The term refers to the field at the intersection between medical informatics, public health, and business147. E-health connects clinical and non - clinical sectors, and includes both individual and population health -oriented tools 148 E-health 147 Eysenbach G. What is e -health? Journal of Medical Internet Research 3(2):e20, 2001. URL: http://www.jmir.org/20012/e20 148 Eng TR. The eHealth Landscape: A Terrain Map of Emerging Information and Communication Technologies in Health and Health Care. The Rob ert Woods Johnson Foundation, 2001. URL: http://www.informatics -review.com/thoughts/rwjf.html . 49 communication strategies include, but are not limited to: health information via the Internet, online support groups, onlin e collaborative communities, information tailored by computer technologies, educational computer games, computer -controlled in -home telephone counselling, and patient -provider e -mail contact 149 Alongside E health the use of new media channels have the addi tional advantage of en abling communication that can be continued rather than limited to set times and the ability to integrate multiple commun ication modes and formats (e.g. audio, video, te xt, graphics). New media also has the ability to track, preserve, and analyse communications and responses to them in real time and analyse trends. The growth in research tools that scan web based social forums and networks and can analyse public reaction and moods are also being increasingly used by the commercial secto r. New medi a also has the advantage of having the ability to customize program mes to user specifications, and interactivity (e.g., increased capacity for feedback) 150 Not all E -health interventions are Web -based. Computer applications have also allowed new uses of traditional health communications media, such as print and telephone. Tailored print communications (TPCs) and telephone -delivered interventions (TDIs) are two examples that have the potential for reaching linguistically and culturally diverse aud iences. For example , interactive games also offer another vehicle for public health interventions via new media channels. For example Lieberman et al. designed a series of Nintendo video games to improve children's prevention and self -care behaviours for a sthma, diabetes, smoking prevention, and other health topics 151 .The games were based on well -established theories of learning and behavio ur change, such as Social Cognitive Theory. They reduced players' urgent care and emergency medical visits by as much a s 77% . 152 The use of new media in addition to the issues raised above also poses three further challenges to public health communicators and those concerned with influencing behaviour during and prior to pandemic events: The issue of non -universal acces s and the digital divide, the issue of disproportionate emphasis being given to minority and non -scientifically justifiable opinion and the lack of robust evidence for the utility of new media interventions. With regard to acce ss issues opportunities are increasing for people to gain free access to the Internet via publicly provided access point s in such areas as libraries and kiosks 153 , however , there are still large groups of often poorer and more vulnerable people who do not have access in many parts of Europe. The additional access issue related to the fact that despite the rapid growth of video and sound content the Internet is still a text -based and driven medium. The issue of literacy as well as health literacy is clearly a key barrier to accessing Web-based information or participating in online communities. There is a danger that new computer technologies could worsen existing inequities in health status for diverse 149 Neuhauser L, Kreps G. Rethinking Communication in the E -health Era.

In the development of any strategy it will be important to involve co mmunity members in addressing issues of access and contribution possibly through interventions such as the provision of access points and training to support usage. A further challenge represented by new media is the on -going journalistic imperative whic h is often enshrined in public communication services charters to present a 'balanced view of issues' Traditional and new media attempts to 'balance coverage ' by the provision of equal opportunity to all viewpoints can lead to what appear s to be legitimate challenges to public health experts advice especially when the views of extremist groups or well known individuals are given media time to express an alternative or negative view . For example , the views of celebrities such as Jim Carrey or Jenny McCarthy who have encouraged parents to question vaccines, have been shown to have an impact on the uptake of vaccines 154 The emergence of social media tools, such as Facebook with more than 955 million monthly active users and with 543 million mo nthly active users who used Facebook via mobile products as of June 2012 155 has also helped create new methods of self - organisation and empowerment of virtual communities both locally and globally that argue against or sometimes campaign for the wide sprea d use of vaccines 156 157 158.The consequence of the new media environment is a mix of highly varied and often conflicting information being distributed and shared. T his can lead to uncertainty and scepticism among citizens. Finally , like many of the other app roaches to communication and behavio ural influence reviewed in this paper new media interventions in the f ield of public health suffer from a lack of robust evidence fro m intervention trials. Though research has demonstrated the effectiveness of some new c ommunications technologies, further inquiry is needed into the mechanisms' underlying success . 159 Conclusion A clear message that comes across f rom this section of the paper is that there appears to be a strong case for using a range of approaches to increase understan ding and awareness about pandemic events. What is equally clear is that information interventions of themselves have been fou nd to be less effective than when they are executed as part of a more comprehensive programme. Many of the exampl es and reviews in this section of the paper indicate that health information approaches work best as part of a range of intervention s to change people's awareness and ultimately behavio ur. On their own informational programmes appear to have a modest contr ibution to make. There appears however , to be less certainty about the exact amount of effort that should be put into informational based approaches in comparison with other forms of behavio ural influence such as design solutions and the provision of ince ntives or disincentives. The relative mixed quality and patchy coverage of the evidence deemed sufficiently robust to give definitive guidance in many areas is also evident. However , the work of NICE, CDC , 154 Jenny Mccarthy joins the defence of Andrew Wakefi eld. http://www. liquida.com /article/15670682/andrew -wakefi eld-autism - jennymccarthy (accessed March 30, 2011). 155 Facebook.

Stud Health Technol Inform 80:205 -12, 2002. 51 McGuire, Solom on and the other author's quoted in this paper along with contributions from other research suggest a number of pra ctical proposals for designing successful informational campaigns as part of broader behaviour influencing strategies. A number of researchers, both in health promotion and health communication fields have attempted to identify the conditions under which information is most effective in promoting health. A detailed analysis of the components of successful and unsuccessful campaigns by McGuire 160 concluded that campaigns that are carefully developed using formative research (both qualitative and quantitative), pay attention to the specific goals of the intervention, target populations, select appropriate channels and develop relevant message content should have a better chance to demonstrate impact. There is also evidence that indicates that health information programmes are most effective when they capture the attention of their target groups . People nee d to be interested and perceive the information to be relev ant and delivered via a trusted source (As discussed in section three of this paper). Impact will also be greatest where there are consistent messages coming from multiple sources161. Douglas Solomon, was extensively involved in many early health media camp aigns in the USA including the Stanford Heart Disease Prevention Project162. Solomon analysed good and bad media campaigns and concluded that campaigns that have been successful owe much of their success to the extensive use of formative research regarding a udience and message variables and to the suppleme ntation of media interventions with interpersonal communication within small groups that provide social support and modelling of appropriate behaviours. Solomon 163 164 proposed a framework for success consistin g of four main factors: 1. Adequate problem analysis including the settin g of detailed objectives (i.e. s pecific, measurable and reasonable), and audience segmentation. 2. Appropriate media selection and use including formative research to provide information about media -use patterns. 3. Effective message design determined by specific objective setting, the generation of alternative message approaches, pre -testing and revision of campaign messages. 4. Evaluation including the study of both outcome and process eval uation. 160 McGuire WJ 1986 The myth of massive media impact: savings and salvagings' Public c ommunications and behaviour , vol 1 pp173 -220 161 Coulter A, Ellins J (2007).

Proto Tool 2 Checklist: When to use the media Some of the situations in which media have been found to be most appropriate are: 1. When wide exposure is desired. Mass media and digital offer the widest possible exposure . Cost-benefit considerations need to be considered when selecting channels. 2. When the time frame is urgent. Mass and digital media offer the best opportunity for reaching either large numbers of people or specific target groups within a short time frame. 3. When public discussion is likely to facilitate the educational process. Media messages can be emotional and thought provoking. Because of the possible breadth of coverage, intrusion can occur at many different levels, stimulating discussion and thereby expanding the impact of a message. However , planning needs to be put in place to address counter arguments an d views that may arise as part of this process. 4. When awareness and attitude change are main goals. All forms of media are awareness - creating tools. Where awareness of a health issue is important to the resolution of that issue, mass and digital media can increase awareness quickly and effectively. 5. When the mass media sector is 'on -side'. Where journalists, editors and programmers are supportive and well briefed and open access has been established to on -going exper t briefing fro m public health authorities 6. When accompanying on-the-ground back -up can be provided. Regardless of whether media alone may be sufficient to influence health behaviour. Impacts will be more pronounced with the support of back -up community b ased program mes and services. Most health behaviour changes require constant reinforcement. Media program mes are most effective where the opportunity exists for long -term follow up. This can take the form of short bursts of media activity over an extende d period, and or follow up activities related to media intervention. 53 7. When a sufficient budget exists. Paid advertising, especially via television, can be very expensive, and the development and maintenance of bespoke interactive digital services also req uire substantial funds. Even limited reach media such as pamphlets and posters can be expensive, depending on quality and quantity and the population penetration required. 8. When the communication goal is simple. In general, the more complex the targete d change, the more back up is required to supplement informational health programmes. Proto Tool 3 Checklist for Designing Information P rogrammes: 1.

To assis t the development of approaches, research should be undertaken by skilled formative researchers (i.e. run focus groups and surveys). 2. Understand the audience. The extent to which a message is attended to, comprehended and used by an audience is largely determined by the extent to which the messenger understands the audience. Detailed profiles of an audience need to be established as a preliminary to media development if a message is to be optimally received. 3. Communicators and agencies need to be fully and continuously briefed about the topic being communicated and any changes occur during an outbreak . 4. Use skilled creative personnel to develop possible interventions and message strategies . Determining and executing that message in a way that is opti mally received and acted upon by a target audience is a highly skilled process. Pre - testing and evaluated during exposure should also be incorporated. 5. Target the message. Different sub -groups have different needs, interests, beliefs and attitudes. Hence , different messages - or at least different message executions should be tailored for different groups. 6. Take account of interpersonal and peer influences . Campaigns should attempt to stimulate interpersonal contact such as the promotion of group and community activities, and the activation of interpersonal communication networks. 7. Maximise contact with the message . Concentrated bursts of spot messages often work better than the same quantity of messages over a long period. Maximising contact also mean s optimising media within the constraints of 54 available budgets. On -going campaigns are necessary to maintain awareness and to reinforce attitude behaviour change. 8. Use multiple channels. Multiple communication channels (i.e. different media and digital me dia vehicles plus various non -media channels) te nd to have a synergistic effect and can carry different types of information. 9. Set a realistic duration for the campaign. Many campaigns have not matched the duration with the desired outcome. Longer campai gns are req uired to achieve more complex or substantial shifts in attitudes and beliefs, whereas shorter campaigns may be sufficient for changes in awareness and understanding. 10. Build t rust: Use a credible source or spokesperson. Source credibility is a major factor affecting message acceptance. Spokespersons should be selected based on research results that indicate that they will be credible to the target audience. Pre and on -going testing for credibility is essential. 11. Do not confuse logic and emot ion. A basic distinction should be drawn between rational and emotional messages in health. A clear rational and if possible evidence and target audience research should be used to devise and select the focus of communications. 12. Set realistic goals. Majo r shifts in attitude and belief are not common in large populations over short periods. Hence it is important that intermediate goals are set. Realistic immed iate small changes in attitude, beliefs and knowledge can be used to track progress over time. 13. Provide environmental supports for change. Research has shown consistently that most media campaigns require 'on -the-ground' back -up support for optimum effect. To accomplish this, media and social media should be accompanied by strategies associated wit h community organisations and opportunities for face to face interaction. 14. Confirm that an information campaign is justifiable . If an information campaign is justifiable and viable this should be determined early on following the formative research phase. Mass media should be looked at in terms of costs and benefits and these should be compared with other information strategies. If an alternative strategy is projected to be slightly les s successful but at much less cost, the goals of a campaign may need to be re -examined. 55 Theory can consequently make a major contribution to improving the design of programmes and maximising potential effects\"165 Understanding f rom T heory a nd M odels Introduction: Human behaviour influences and is influenced by many factors including: individual personality and will power , physiology, genetics, culture, evolution, technology, social norms, upbringing, habits, economic s, culture and customs. See proto tool 3 in the previous section. This next section of the paper sets out some of the key models and theories of behavioural change that seek to distil these many influences . There is a key distinction to be made between 'models ' of behavio ur and 'theories ' of change. Behavioural 'models ' seek to explain why people behave in the way they do and help us understand specific behaviours, by identifying the underlying factors which influence them. Whilst 'theories of change ' seek to explain how behaviour s changes and what might influence it. Theories of change can also help intervention development by suggesting broad approaches to intervention design, implementation and evaluation. However , the language of 'theory ' and 'models ' do in the liter ature overlap to a large degree. In addition to the distinction between 'theory ' and 'model ', Danton166 notes a further distinction between models: 1. Models of behaviour at the individual level . 2. Models of behaviour at higher levels of scale . 3. Applied models and frameworks . It is also possible to add to this list of models, 'behaviour change and communication planning models ' such as PRECEDE -PROCEED167, WHO COMBI model 168 P-Process model , 169 STELA model . 170 A review of these and other planning models is included in section nine of this paper. There are large numbers of theories and models and many summary reviews already exist, therefore this section of the paper does not attempt to set out a comprehensive review of all 165 Green J.

The next section of this paper looks at a number of attempts to develop comprehensive taxonomies o f theories and models and to combine them into meta models that can assist those planning and researching social programmes designed to influence behaviour , understand the interconnections bet ween elements of these models and what this means for decision m aking about the design of interventions. Theories can be defined in many ways , but essentially they are composed of a set of interrelated concepts, definitions and propositions that present model s of how behaviour is formed or influenced in given situatio ns. Theories are used to mostly describe and in some cases attempt to predict future behavio ural responses. Theory is useful because it provides clear framework s for analysing and conceptualising the process of behavioural influence and change and can also be used guide research on specific behaviours and to assist with the planning and selection of programme interventions. Theories and models used to guide health communication and behavio ur change programmes, assist the understanding of complex sets of i nfluences, however, due to their simplifying nature, they are not capable of providing us with a complete understanding of problems at the individual, political and environmental level171. Crosby and Noar have argue d that theory is stuck within an \"academic vacuum\", implying that when applied to the real-world, theory is often not valid172. By contrast, we can consider the example given by Green. Green states that an intervention which provides informa tion on condoms to young people: \"...will have little effect unless they also have the skills to obtain and use condoms, they are able to be assertive in negotiating condom use with their partner, condoms are available, and so on. Theory can consequently make a major contribution to improving the design of programme s and maximising potential effects\"173. This suggests that theory may in fact, be essential for the planning and evaluation of effective health promotion action. Traditionally many behavioural theories and models have been developed within the discipline o f psychology. Examples of some of these mo dels and theories which emphasize the importance of knowledge and beliefs in achieving change include: the health belief model174, the trans -theoretical model 175 and social cognitive theory176. These three models howeve r, are now frequently criticised for being focused on individual is sues and not taking account of economic, social or environmental issues which have a big impact on behaviour177. As well as newer \" ecological \" models and theories that do recognise the import ance of environmental, social and economic factors, additional new understanding and theory is being developed by economists and brain scientists. This relatively new theory indicates that as well as reasoned action and environmental impacts , many health d ecision s 171 Nutbeam D.

The use of theory and mode ls of behavioural influence is not without difficulty or disp utes about its helpfulness. For example , a meta -analysis by Park -Higgerson which analyses health promotion interventions on violence, failed to find evidence which suggested that theory -based interventions resulted in better outcomes than those without theory178. However, some studies argue that it is in fact the incorrect selection of theory which limits the potential of an intervention and not the inclusion of theory in general179 180. The selection of an inappropriate theory is comprehendible considering there is an excess of theories within the health promotion field. In addition, rather than using one theory, a combination of theories is advocated, as by using more than one theory a problem can be accounted for and evaluated at all theoretical levels181. In a recen t systematic review to examine the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions that use theories and models of behaviour change in the design and delivery of the prevention and control of communicable disease commissioned by ECDC182. Sixty one studies p assed the critical screening methodology, twenty one of which were designated of high quality. Nearly all the studies used a communications based approach and were what the authors describe as 'tentative' in their use of new media. There was also a major focus on end used behaviour rather than health professionals o r intermediaries . Behaviour change theories and mode ls were used in these studies to either inform the behaviour change intervention progr amme or were used to design or evaluate the study interv ention, T here was a strong preference for theories and models fo cused on individual behaviour. Models of interpersonal behav iour were the next most frequently used, with community and theo retical planning models used less often. Nearly one third of the stu dies used multiple models. With regard to the impact of the use of theory on the impact of the programmes, results were mixed. Of the high quality studi es focused on prevention nine were successful in meeting their behavio ural targets, six were not . Of the eight interventions focused on control six met their behavioural goals two did not. There was no comparative evidence available to state whether using theory made the interventions effective or not. Howe ver, the researchers then looked at the character istics of the successful and un successful programmes. What emerged was that studies that use theory to in form the design and evaluation of interventions, and go beyond the use of just individual theories to encapsulate broader interpersonal and community t heory appear ed to be more successful. The review also found that only one study evaluated the cost effectiveness of theory based interventions. So whilst the evidence is not categorical it is reasonable to conclude that t he use of theory in both analysis o f behavioural challenges and to guide the planning of programme responses 178 Park-Higgerson H, Perumean -Chaney SE, Bartolucci AA, Grimley DM, Singh KP.

Using theory can result in better planning, targeting and the setting out of more explicit aims and objectives . Theory can also help interventions more precisely focus on influencing specific elements of a behavio ur based on a theoretical conceptio n of what has and or wi ll influence people to behave in the desired way. Clearly many academic and practical disciplines ha ve a contribution to make to understanding and attempts to inf luence behaviour. In t he public health and health promotion fields the main sources of understanding until comparatively recently have been psychology, sociology, communic ation studies, media studies, communi ty st udies and education. More recently the fields of economics , marketing, design, social networking and economics ha ve also begun to make a contribution. The applied fields of health education, health promotion, community development, health communication and social marketing are used to develop and deliver intervention programmes based on the theories and models derive d from these fields of study. Given this wide range of study and applied interpretation a broad range of theoretical models as well as behavio ural understanding is available to those seeking to influence awareness and behaviour in the field of pandemic eve nt management . Many governments185 and health organisations are attaching increasing importance to behaviour change theory in developing successful policy interventions , in the field of health 186 but also other related social issue s such as environment and sustainability187. One of the big challenges facing those responsible for developing and delivering communication programmes designed to inf luence understanding and or behaviour is to understand and make a reasoned selection and use of the many theories that have b een articulated to inform their programme design and d elivery. The broad scope of theory and models which is continuously expanding can be perceived as a barrier to its use. The literature in the field is \"enormous \" 188 and \" bordering on the unmanageable \"189. Time pressured public health professionals may well be reluctant to engage fully with theory and behavioural modelling even though they are aware of the insights it can bring due to this complexity. This broad sweep of theo ries and models also raises the problem of developing transparent method s or process for selecting models or elements from multiple models to guide public health work in a given situation with a selected segment of the population. This section of th e pap er aims to set out a selection of the m ost quoted and most widely used theories and models and present a set of proto tools to assist practitioners with an understanding of current studies about influencing behaviour and how to begin to use theory in the c onstruction of health campaigns . This section is not intended to be a comprehensive review of all relevant models and theories rather it sites a number of often quoted models that have relevance to pandemic communication and behaviour change programme deve lopment. 183 Roe, L., Hunt, P., Bradshaw, H. et al.

London: SDRN. 59 There are many different ways to classify and describe the wide range of behavio ural theory and models that exist. For the purpose of this paper these theories and models are set out under the following headings: Individual level theories - describing the behaviour of individuals (theories of cognition, perceptions and motivation ) Interpersonal level theories - describing the relationships between individuals (theories of social norms and social influence ) Community / group theories - stressing the dynamics of community structures or institutions , theories of community mobilisation, inter -sectorial action and organisational change. Big systems theories and models dealing with multiple influencing factors . Health focused theories and models . Individual Level T heories There are a wide range of individually focused behaviour change theories. The individual focused theories and models set out below (Based of summaries by Mulgan et al 190 and COI)191 are some of the most commonly used to explain factors that impact on individual behaviour and have been used extensively in the health sector.192 Many of these models explore factors such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, motivation, s elf-concept, learning , past experience and skills and self perception as key determinants of behaviour . Instrumental and Classical C onditioning Seminal work: Pavlov (1927)193Skinner 1953194 This model based on empirical experimentation with both animals and humans emphasises the impact on learning of associations between stimuli and the subsequent impact s on behaviour. Classical conditioning occurs when an 'unconditioned stimulus', such as food, becomes associated with another stimulus, such as a bell. The establish ment of such associations can be applied in many ways to set up either positive or negative associations and so influence behaviour. Classical conditioning theory can be applied in many fields associated with complex human behaviour as well as simple anima l response situations. E ven highly complex human behaviours can often be explained through long chains of such associations. 190 Mulgan G, Aldridge S, Beales G, Heathfield A, Halpen D, Bates C .Personal Responsibility a nd Changing Behaviour : the state of knowledge and its implications for public policy.

New York: Macmillan. 60 Cognitive Consistency and Dissonance T heory Seminal work: Festinger, 1957195 The 'cognitive consistency theory' proposes that people are motivated to seek consistency between their beliefs, values, and perc eptions. The theory postulates that w here there is a clash between people's actions and values or attitudes, people often resolve the discrepancy by changing their values or attitudes rather than their behaviour. For example, if someone agrees to take on a boring task for a very limited reward, there is a 'dissonance' between their behaviour (doing the task) and their reasoning (they would only do a boring task if there's a decent reward). One way out of this dissonance is to stop doing the tas k - i.e. change the behaviour, a nother is to change their attitude - i.e. convince themselves that the task is actually quite interesting . Cognitive dissonance can be used in public health programmes through a process of highlighting clashes of behaviour and attitudes for example by highlighting differences in favourable attitudes to hand washing and actual poor practice as a way of triggering change. 'Heuristics' and the Consumer Information -Processing in detail how humans use mental shortcuts, or 'heuristics' to make sense of their world and decision making and the impact this has on behaviour. Under normal circumstances heuristics do not present a problem, but in certain situations the use of these mental short -cuts can m ake people systematically prone to mis judgement and biases . Central assumptions are that: individuals are limited in how much information they can process; and in order to increase the usability of information, they combine bits of information into 'chunks', and employ decision ru les, to make choices faster and in a less stressful way . Major heuristics include ones relating to: Availability and stimulation , scarcity, fear of loss, p eak experience and \"recency \" and discounting over time. All of these potential biases can have large effects on health related behaviour. For example fear of loss, e.g. loss of physical functioning or mental capacity is often a better approach to framing public health messages than emphasising the g ains that people may get in terms of protection from the adoption of a recommended behaviour. 195 Festinger, L.

Seminal work: Prochaska & DiClemente (1983)198 This is perhaps one of the best known and most quoted models used in many public health interventions . It proposes five stages of people's readiness to change or attempts to change . The stages are not necessaril y passed through sequentially. The s tages of change models treat s behaviour change as a linear process wi th discrete ordered stages . People can enter and exit at any point, and often 'recycle' through stages of change . This model has influenced methods of social marketing which gradually build people's willingness to take on large -scale behaviour changes. The model is useful as it identifies that there are different elements/stages to behaviour change and it attempts to disentangle these complex processes; therefore enabling practitioners to both segment audiences and develop interventions for people at diff erent stages of change. O ne of the key limitations of the model is that it does not explain what the triggers to the different stages are, nevertheless insights from other psychology models and from behavioural economics and social marketing may help to a ddress this gap. 198 Prochaska, J. O., & DiClemente, C. C. (1983) Stages and processes of self -change of s moking: Toward an integrative model of change . Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 51, 390 -395. 62 Theory of Planned Behaviour, Reasoned Action Seminal works: Fishbein and Ajzen (1975)199; Ajzen (1985)200 The theory of Planned Behaviour and its precursor the Theory of Reasoned Action examine the relationship between behaviour and psychological issues such as beliefs, attitudes and intentions. The model was originally based on the assumption that human beings are rational and that behaviours are therefore under their control and develop for a set of reasoned decisions . However, in the 1990 's, Ajzen and Driver added an element which acknowledged the importance of factors beyond the individual 's control , which impact on ability to change behaviour. This became known as the Theory of Planned Behaviour which has been used by many public health programmes. The theory holds that 'behavioural intention' is the key determinant of behaviour and that an individual's attitude towards performing behaviour is one of the biggest influences on behavioura l intention. Subjective norms, are belief s about what others think about the behaviour under consideration, this is seen as having a key impact on behavioural intention. The T heory of Planned Behaviour adds, Perceived behavioural control, this is the amount of control an individual perceives t hey have over a behaviour and explains when behaviour or behavioural intention is influenced by factors beyond an individual's perceived control. In highlighting the i mportance of subjective norms, i .e. the perceived beliefs of ot hers as well as individual attitudes and characteristics, the theory provides a conceptual link to interpersonal and community theories of behaviour change. The theory also highlights why knowledge al one doesn't necessarily le ad to a change in a person's behaviour . Protection -Motivation Theory Seminal work: Rogers 1975:201 Protection -motivation theory (PMT) considers that behaviour change may be achieved by appealing to an individual's fears. It identifies three components of fear arousal: The magnitude of harm of a depicted event; the probability of that event's occurrence and the efficacy of the proposed protective response. PMT suggested that these components combine to determine the intensity of the protection motivation resulting in activity 199 Fishbein, M. and Azjen, I.

J Psychol 1975 , 91:93-114. 63 occurring as a result of a desire to protect oneself from danger. This theory ex plicitly uses the costs and benefits of existing and recommended behaviour to predict the likelihood of behaviour change202. The most recent version of the theory assumes that the motivation to protect oneself from danger is a positive linear function of be liefs that the threat is severe, that the individual is personally vulnerable and that the individual can perform the coping response and that the coping response is effective at reducing or eliminating risk. This theory has influenced many public health p rogrammes that deal with r isks associated with infections. The implication of the theory is that people need to recognise risks, their vulnerability to the risk and believe the efficacy of the recommended action. Protection -motivation theory Interpersonal Level T heories Interpersonal models and theories focus on the wider social interactions and environment and how this impacts on beha viour. These mod els assume that people are strongly influenced by the opinions, views, beliefs and the values of people that they interact with especially close relations and significant people in their lives. The se models also exp lore how significant others can assis t or detract from social responsible decisions. This f ocus i s key in terms of developing influenci ng strategie s as it may be possible to devel op interventions that target one group with the a im of influencing another . Behaviour change is often better effe cted by focusing not just on individual s, but also on their relati onships with those around them . These models cover both small micro environmental social influences such as the views of close family members but also larger social effects such as the impact of public opinions, the influence of social norms and how changes in these spread across popula tions. Examples include interventions that focus on the use of social networks, pe er support, role models and mentors , to influence behaviour and attitudes. 202 Gebhardt WA, Maes S: Integrating social -psychological frameworks for health behaviour research. Am J Health Beh 2001 , 25:528-536. 64 Social Cognitive T heory Seminal work: Bandura (1986)203 204 This theory focuses on skill and competency, and emphasises the importance of enhancing a person's behavioural capability and self -confidence. In social cognitive theory (SCT), human behaviour is explained in terms of how personal fa ctors, environmental in fluences and behaviour continually interact. SCT postulates that behaviour can be influenced by increasing knowledge and skills. SCT asserts that human behaviour is directly s haped by an individual's competencies and their beliefs in their own capabilities . Bandura argues that human behaviour is a result of the constant interplay of personal factors (cognitive, affective/emotional and biological events), environmental (external) factors and how people interpret the results of their behaviour . People make th ings happen by their own actio ns, drawing on a range of personal factors, including habits of thinking and self beliefs. SCT is based on the view that h umans are instilled with c ertain capabilities including: the capacity to Symbolize (which enables us to extract meaning from the environment around us and solve problems). Forethought : (A capability to plan courses of ac tion, anticipate and set goals) . Vicarious learning : (The ability to observe and learn from others) Self regulation : (The potential for self -directed change). Self reflection : (Enabling us to make sense of our experiences and self evaluation) . SCT holds that each of us has different levels of these capabilities and types of skill and competencies. Key to SCT is the conc ept of 'self efficacy' . Self efficacy determines how we feel and think about ourselves and u ltimately how we behave. Belief in self-efficacy can have diverse effects; it can determine the amou nt of effort and perseverance people put into a task and how muc h resilience they display in adverse or challenging situat ions. Importantly, what we believe we are capable of may actually differ from what we can actually do. Band ura believes that people's self -beliefs are more likely to influence what they do than th eir actua l skills and competencies. Self -efficacy beliefs are influenced by four main sources: Mastery experiences : that is personal experience of our own successes and failures. Vicarious experiences : observing the success and failure of others. Social pe rsuasion : the direc t influence of those around us and finally Somatic and E motional states i.e. stress, anxiety, positive and negative moods which can affect people's judgements of their personal efficacy as can the physical c ondition or state of their bod y, for example how ti red a person is or how hungry . 203 Bandura, A.1986 Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory . Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. 204 Bandura, A 1977. Self-efficacy: toward a unifying theory of behavioral change . Psychological Review 84, 191 -215. 65 Social Networks and Social Support Seminal work: House (1981)205 According to House a social network is a web of social relationships, which is characterised by a number of actions and states of mind including: Reciprocity (The behaviour of both , giving and receiving or ex changing mutually beneficial goods , services or support) and emotional closeness and social support. An effective social network is also characterised by the extent to which members interact and get to know each other. Additional actors in the creation and maintenance of effective social networks that provide support relate to how similar members of the network are in terms of their demographic s but also intellectual, em otional and belief systems. Other factors include ease of communication and assembly such as geographical dispersion or co mpactness. Social support is characterised as a form of aid and assistance which is exchanged through social networks. According to this theory some of the most powerful influences on a person's behaviour and views wil l be formed and supported by the attit udes and resources within a person's social network . One of the consequences of this is that the theory indicates that people will be far more influenced by the views and actions of friends and family than by advice from government or professionals not wit hin their social network. Social Influence and Interpersonal Communication theory Seminal work: Kelly & Thibaut (1978)206 According to Kelly and Thibaut i nterpersonal communication is influenced by a number of factors associated with both the nature of the person that is seeking to exert influence and the form or type of influencing strategy that is being applied. Interpersonal social influence is influenced strongly by both the perceived power and the authority that is invested in the person seeking to exert influence by the person being influenced . According to this theory t he basis of power or authority in a relationship m ay be categorised in six ways: 1. Expert - someone else is more knowledgeable. 2. Legitimate - someone has the 'right' to direct behaviour derived from a recognised social role that is imbued with credibility and authority. 3. Coercive - when another has the power to punish. 4. Reward - when another has the power to reward. 5. Informational - the person who is seeking to persuade holds important information of value to the receiver. 6. Referent - Power is based on identification with the person trying to exert influence. This is among the most effective sources of power and is affected by factors such as 'liking' or empat hy with the persuader. Perceived power and authority are key factors in communication and persuasion and may often assist with securing 'c ompliance' with recommended actions . 205 House, JS.

New York: Wiley. 66 Attribution and balance theories Seminal work: Heider (1958)207 These are theories concerning how people explain the behaviour of their own and other people. Phenomena identified by these theories include: Fundamental attribution error, this refers to the human tendency to over -emphasise dispositional (Personal attribu tes) factors about people, and under -emphasise situational (Environmental) factors. An example in the field of vaccination would be attributing a person's failure to become vaccinated to their laziness about coming forward rather than difficulties associat ed with access to a service provider. False uniqueness is the human tendencie s to hold an exaggerated view of our own positive qualities and abilities. Most people also tend to underestimate others abilities as well as over emphasi sing our own. False consensus is the tendency that p eople have to overestimate the extent to which others agree with their own views and beliefs . Inter - group bias refers to similar self -serving attribution biases, but at the group level. People attribute disproportionate ly good qualities and virtues to groups they belong to and or identify with, while seeing members of other groups as possessing fewer positive qualities . An implication of these theories is that care needs to be taken to understand how these heuristics may be used to interpret efforts to create change or compliance with public health recommendations. Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour (TIB) Seminal work: Triandis 1977208. This theory takes account for individuals less rational decision making and the impact of habit on influencing behaviour. Habit is defined as a separate and key causal factor in the model, alongside attitudes, norms, roles , self-concept, beliefs and attitudes to likely outcomes. The model gives significant empha sis to the power of habit running parallel to intentions in determining behaviour. TIB indicates that our behaviour can sometimes be utterly unplanned and unconscious. TIB has been shown to be a good or better predict or of behaviour in situations where there is a significant hab itual component. Embodied in the model is the thesis that our behaviour can follow two different paths: a deliberative path (via intentions) and an automatic path (via habits). This duel path theor y or what has been called system s one and systems two thin king will be further exp lored in section seven of this paper. Put simply, System 1 cognition is fast , easy and automatic, while System 2 is slow and deliberate . The two Systems run in parallel: much of our behaviour is automatic and directed by System 1, b ut on occasions we perform careful deliberation, and that occurs in System 2 but this type of decisio n making is hard and we soon tire of it. Habits are bound up in this thinking , the two paths or processes run in parallel, one 207 Heider, F. 1958. The Psychology of Inter -Personal Relations. NY: Wiley. Section 7: Sentiment Behaviour. Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole. Vare P and W Scott 2007. Learning for a Change: Exploring the Relationship Between Education and Sustainable 67 moderating the influence of the other: we are rarely purely deliberative or purely habitual in our behaviour . The implications of TIB for policy makers and practitioners in the public health field is that much of our behaviour and much of our decision making is simply automatic or habitual , therefore appeals based on rational choice may have little influence on behaviour if the behaviour in question is following the habitual path. The best predictor of people's future behaviour is how they have behaved in the past or to study their habits. Community/Group T heories Recent developments in the understanding of behaviour h ave focused on the importance of behaviour in a community context; there is cle arly a great deal of overlap between these theories and those that relate to interpe rsonal influence. These theories and models explore how social systems function and change an d their impact on individuals and influencers. They also aim to explain how behaviour change can be encouraged in groups and organisations. Clearly such models have utility in informing and understanding approaches to influencing communities, the mobilizat ion of inter -sectorial co -operation and inter - organisational change , as well a s a key impact on health communications and attempts to individuals influence beh aviour. Social Capital T heory Seminal (1988)210 Putnam R (1995)211 The 'Social capital ' concept or theory holds that social capital exists and can be measured in a community and that it is made up of the quantity and quality of social 209 Bourdieu, P. (1986) The Forms of Capital in Baron, S., Field, J. and Schuller, T. (eds.) (2000) Social Capital - Critical Perspectives. Oxford University Press. 210 Coleman, J. (1988) Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital American Journal of Sociology 94 Supplement S95 -S120. University o f Chicago. 211 Putnam, R (1995) Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital Journal of Democracy 6 (1) 65-78. 68 networks and personal relationships, and the co -operative quality of a society's social interactions. Social capital can also be discerned through observation of the consistency of application of social norms and values of how a community informally and f ormally shapes the quantity of social interactions. The core insight of this theory is that social networks and co -operative social norms have positive personal value to individuals and t o wider communities. Three types of social capital are often distin guished: bonding social capital (e.g. among family members or ethnic groups); bridging social capital (e.g. across ethnic groups); and linking social capital (e.g. across political classes).Variations in the strength or weakness of social capital are refle cted in and may partly explain variations in key social outcomes, including, crime rates, educational performance, mortality and morbidity and economic performance. A key implication of this theory is that one of the prerequisites for effective social prog rammes may be the need to build , enhance or incentivise the development of social capital. Diffusion of Innovations (DI) Seminal work : Rogers & Everett (1995)212 Diffusion o f Innovations theory addresses how new ideas, products, and social practices spread within a society or from one society to another. Diffusion is facilitat ed through five key concepts, relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, observability and trialling. Relative advantage is the extent to which an innovation is better than what it r eplaces. An innovation can be a product, service idea, a behaviour programme or policy . An innovation presents a clear choice for an individual to continue with an inferior activity or embrace a superior one. Compatibility this concept describes h ow well the innovation fits with the values, habits, experience and needs of the intended audience. Complexity acknowledges that people are more likely to make a behaviour change if the suggested innovation is easy to implement. Trialability refers to the concept of 'try before you buy' with innovations being more likely to succeed if individuals can try them before committing totally to a behaviour. Observability indicates how likely the innovation will be to produce tangible results and also how socially visible is it to other people who often want other people to be able to see that they are taking up new behaviours or have bought new products. DI theory indicates that populations can be classified by their approach to new innovations into five groups: Innovators : This relatively small group will be the first to adopt the new innovations. They place a great deal of value on being the first to get the benefits of the new innovation and being seen to be innovators by other groups. They strongly influence the next group , the Early Adopters. Early A dopters : This is the second fastest category of individuals who adopt an innovation. These individuals have the highest degree of opinion leadership among the other adopter categories. Early A dopters are typically younger in age, have a higher social status, have more financial lucidity, advanced education, and are more socially forward than late adopters. 212 Rogers and Everett. (1995) Diffusion of I nnovations . Fourth edition. New York, NY: The Free Press. 69 Early Majority A dopters : Individuals in this category adopt an innovation afte r a varying degree of time. The time of adoption is significantly longer than the innova tors and early adopters. Early M ajority Adopters tend to have above average social status, contact with early adopters, and show some opinion leadership . Late Majority A dopters : Individuals in this category will adopt an innovation after the average member of the society . The Late Majority Adopters are typically sceptical about an innovation, have below average social status and often have less financial resources. They are in contact with o thers in late majority and early majority, but very little opinion leadership . Laggards : Individuals in this category are the last to adopt an innovation. These individuals typically have an aversion to change and c hange -agent s and tend to be older . Lagga rds typically t end to be focused on \"traditional solutions \" and have low social status and fewer financial resources. They are in contact with family and close friends but have very little to no opinion leadership with other categories. The rates of adoption for innovations are determined by an individual's adopter category. In general individuals who first adopt an innovation require a shorter adoption period than late adopters. Within the rate of adoption there is a point at which an innovation reac hes critical mass or tipping point213. This is a point in time within the adoption curve that enough individuals have adopted an innovation in order that the continued adoption of the innovation is self -sustaining. In describing how an innovation reaches cri tical mass, Rogers outlines several strategies in order to help an innovation reach this stage. These strategies all have relevance for public health interventions , have the innovation endorsed and adopted by a highly respected individual within a social n etwork, creating an instinctive des ire for a specific innovation; i nject an innovation into a group of individuals who would readily use an innovation and provide positive reactions and benefits for early adopters of an innovation. Big Systems T heory There is a growing consensus in many field s that health focused behavioural int erventions should be based on what has been described as an 'Ecological model ' 214. An ecological model 215 approach views human behaviour as a form of complex ecology with multiple influences. Health behaviour in this conception is influenced by a dynamic interaction between bi ology, psychological factors and environmental influences. The relationship and 213 Gladwell M.

The following thre e example s of complex ecological systems set out below are complemented by the Dalgren and Whitehead model216 in the follo wing section on health focused models. System s Thinking and Change Seminal works Argyris, C and D Schon 1996217. Senge 1990 218 Systems thinking is a theory developed as an approach to problem solving. Many of our current social problems are conceived as consequences of wider complex social systems. The central premise of systems thinking is that systems have \" emergent properties \" and the components of these systems interact to create effects which the components could not have generated on their own. Systems ar e believed to exhibit the following characteristics , they are: Self-organizing, Non -linear , Constantly changing, Hi story dependent, Tightly linked , Counter -intuitive, Governed by feedback and Resistant to change219. Systems thinking is focused on understanding the total system of influences and how its components interact in a holistic way rather than dissembling factors through a process of individually analysing individual element s. In this way systems thinking is the exact opposite of much public health analysis that seeks to disassemble complex problems into discrete components that can be studied. Senge makes the distinction between 'detail complexity', which traditional analysis can deal with by disassembly, and 'dynamic complexity' which involves systemic int eractions over time, and generates emergent properties. In the context of influences on behaviour the feedback loop is the central construct in systems thinking. Behaviour in systems thinking develops through continuous positive and negative feedback loops rather than through simple cause and effect relationships. Systems thinking also makes the distinction between transformational and incremental change. Transformational change requires the kind of deep insight that can expose and reshape underlying assump tions, whereas incremental change works within the existing structure . Systems thinking , challenges the traditional approaches to behaviour change, which use theory to identify what works so it can be replicated elsewhere. In contrast systems thinking prop oses an approach of reflective practice and continuous inquiry not the implementing of set approaches or theories. Systems thinking methods are particularly good for approaching messy problems, where diverse stakeholders are involved and cause and effects are multiple . Collective diagnosis of problems and co llective development of solutions are key elem ents of syste ms thinking and organisational change models. Systems thinking is advocated by WHO220, who have identified a ten step approach to systems thinking in the health sector: 1. Convene stakeholders . 2. Determine indicators . 3. Collectively brainstorm . 4. Choose methods . 5. Conceptualize effects . 6. Select design . 7. Adapt and redesign . 216 Dahlgren G.

The N eeds , Opportunities Abilities M odel Seminal work: Gatersleben and Vlek 1998221 The Needs, Opportunity, Ability (NOA) model of consumer behaviour is a good example of a n ecological model that explicitly incorporates factors at the environmental level. NOA consists of an intention -based model of individual behaviour 'nested' within a model that shows the influence of macro -level environmental factors. At the individual level, intentions are formed through both 'motivation' (which is driven by needs and o pportunit ies) and 'behavioural control' or agency (which is driven by opportunities and abilities). \"At the macro level, needs, opportunities and abilities are influenced by the five environmental factors : technology, economy, demography, institutions and culture. The model shows a two -way relationship between environmental factors and consumer behaviour, with a large 'feedback loop' linking the top and bottom levels \"222. NAO provides a valuable demonstration of how macro factors can influence behaviour and s hows clearly that focusing only on personal factors may not bring about change. The NOA model also shows how consumer behaviour influences societal factors, by means of a feedback loop. One of t he key implications of the model is the need to work at multiple levels of influence to generate change in behaviour across a social system focusing on needs, opportunities and ensuring people have the ability to change . 221 Gatersleben, B and C Vlek 1998.

Cultural Theory asserts t hat structures of social organis ation such as its rules, structures and how these rules are controlled by societies endow individuals with perceptions that reinforce those structures in competition against alternative views. Cultural theory sets out four types of understandings that can be found in different societies or groups: Egalitarian, Individualist, Hierarchical and F atalist . The particular domination of any of these types of understanding in different cultures depends on two different criteria: Grid issues: rules and individual roles and : Group orientation : the importance of collective control and consensus within the group or society . Where there is high Grid and Group orientations, there will tend to be hierarchical cultures. Conversely, where there are low Grid and Group te ndencies, there wil l tend to be more individualist cultures. The key practical public health implication of this theory within a European context is that efforts to address behaviour change and develop effective communication interventions in relation to pandemic preparedness will need to be informed by and reflect all of these different cultural understandings if change is to be delivered across diverse communities within Europe . Since every community contains some element of Grid and Group diversity , efforts at tackling problems are unlikely to bear fruit unless they accommodate each perspective. The theory ther efore indicates that a mixture of rules (Hierarchicalism), norms and community values (Egalitarianism) and incentives and support structures (Individualism) will all be needed to deliver effective behaviour change programmes. 223 Douglas, M.

Berkeley: University of California Pre 73 Health F ocused Theories Determinants of Health M odel Seminal Work : Dahlgren and Whitehead 1991225. The Determinant of Health (DoH) model is a big systems model focused on the key factors that impact on an individual or communities health. The Do H model is represented diagrammatically as a rainbow -like set of tiers of social, economic and behavioural factors surround ing individuals whose biological variables (e .g. age, sex and genetics) are fixed at the centre of the model. The model illustrates fo ur tiers, and describes intervention types for each one, as follows. The top tier is the macro - level 'structural environment'. The next tier is 'material living conditions', including housing, education and the workplace (subject to legislation/regulation and the provision of public services). Moving closer to the individual, the third tier is 'material support networks' including family and friends (subject to strengthening networks and building community capacity). The closest tier is 'lifestyle/behaviour al factors' (subject to influencing interventions, including the provision of information). This model is widely quoted in ma ny public health strategy and pol icy documents as a helpful summary of the influences on health. The implication of the model is that public health action should be focused on the determinants of health at every level of the model. A further implication of the model is that action is ne eded on the detriments or causes of poor health rather than a focus on t he consequences or ultimat e symptoms of poor health brought about by individual behaviour . In the field of 'pandemic preparedness' the implication would be the need to strengthen community resi lience and macro -economic policy as components of strategies . 225 Dahlgren G. Whitehead M, Policies and strategies to promote social equity in health , Institute of Futures Studies, Stockholm, 1991 74 Health Belief Model Seminal work Rosenstock 226 The health belief model was one of the first social cognition models focused on health decision making and behaviour. The model was further developed by Janz and Becker227 and colleagues in the 1970s and 1980s. Subsequent a mendments to the model were made to accommodate evolving evidence generated within the health community about the role that knowledge and perceptions play in personal responsibility. The model suggests th at belief in a personal threat together with a belief in the effectiveness of the proposed behaviour wil l predict the likelihood of a behaviour. The four key constructs of the mode l are: Perce ived susceptibility (A n individual's assessment of their risk of getting the condition) . Perceived severity (A n individual's assessment of the seriousness of the condition, and its potential consequences) . Perceived barriers (A n individual's assessment of the influences that facilitate or discourage adoption of the p romoted behaviour) . Perceived benefits (A n individual's assessment of the positive consequences of adopting the behaviour). A number of mediating factors have been added to the model , these include demographic and socio -psychological variables. Rosenstock argues these variables on their own do not necessarily mean that an individual will be motivated to carry out the desired health behaviour. He points to the importance of 'cues to action' to prompt a change in behaviour. These cues are events either 'bodil y' (e.g. physical symptoms of a health condition) or environmental (e.g. media publicity). There are some general limitations to the Health Belief Model that need to be borne in mind, it does not spe cify how different beliefs influence each other, it does not take into account environmental or economic factors that may infl uence health behaviours and it does not overtly consider the influence of others on people's decisions. The model however , does indicate that a focus of threat, perceived vulnerability a nd the efficacy of recommended actions should all form part of any approach to pandemic communication and behaviour change. 226 Rosenstock IM (1966), \"Why people use health services\", Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly 44 (3): 94 -12 227 Janz, N. K.; Becker, M. H. (1 January 1984). \"The Health Belief Model: A Decade Later\". Health Education & Behavior 11 (1): 1-47 75 Heath Action M odel Seminal Work Tones 1990 228 229 The Health Action Model (HAM) , conceptually incorporates the Health Belief Model and Ajzen and Fishbein 's Theory of Reasoned Action. The HAM takes account of beliefs, normative influences and motivating factors, including attitudes, along with other strong motivating forces, such as hunger, pain, pleasure and sex, in order to understand behaviour. Identity and self -esteem are key factors introd uced by this model as important mediating factors. Self-esteem encompasses appearance, intelligence and physical skills, as well as an individual's perception of how other people view them and the ability to make choices which are different from those of the group. In this model, behaviour change depends on: 1. A high level of self -esteem . 2. Skills and strategies to resist peer group pressure . 3. An assessment of the pros and cons of change . 4. Motivation to conform. HAM is based on the idea that people with a high level of self -esteem and a positive self-concept are likely to feel confident a bout themselves and as a result will have the ability to carry through a resolve to change thei r behaviour. Conversely, people with a low level of self -esteem are likely to believe that they have limited control over their fate and will be less likely to respond to a health promotion message, no mat ter how convinced they are by it at an intellectual level. The model also emphasises th e need for facilitating factors, such as a supportive environment or the possession of personal skills, to support the translation of behavioural intention into action. The model illustrates that people's health behaviour is dependent, to a large extent, on the conditions of their lives, which for many are beyond their control. An implication of HAM is that a key part of many public health programmes may need to be focused on building up through community health education programmes self esteem, health literacy and health skills. 228 Tones, K., Tilford, S., & Robinson, Y.

Second Edition Sage 2010 76 Conclusion The above selective review of some of t he key behavio ural change theories and models illustrates that there is a great deal of understanding abo ut the many factors at individual , group and society levels that impact on health decision making and behaviour. It is also clear that there is a need to place behavioural influence, the ultimate objective of many public health interventions at the heart of public health communication and behavioural change plannin g. In public health communication and marketing programmes we usually want to influence citizen's current awareness, attitudes, beliefs and behaviour so that some or all of these have been changed positively in line with policy objectives. Public health practitioners often want to take consumers on a behavioural journey from where they are now in terms of awareness, attitudes, beliefs and behaviour to a destination where some or all of these elements have been changed favourably according to designated policy objectives. Consequently, there is a need to articulate t his behavioural journey clearly because it should enable practitioners to identify and define what the y want to measure in their evaluation. In planning intervention theories and models that can help frame thinking about how to influence beh aviour. What is clear from the above brief review is that to increase the relevance of individual models of behavio ur or theories of change it may be useful to use a 'mix and match' approach . When planning health promoting programmes, theories and models should have a central role in assisting the design and evaluation of the effective programmes230,231. As this sec tion of the paper has demonstrated , theory and models are key element s in planning any effective programme. When planning interventions practitioners and policy makers should alway s start by seeking out theory and models that can help frame thinking about how t o influence behaviour. However , as this section of the paper has also demonstrated practitioners do not always start with this process and even if they do the evidence about the added value of applying theory is not unequivocal . One of the tentative conc lusions that can be drawn f rom this review is that theories intended to modify individual level behaviours remain the most commonly applied. Policy and training interventions could be developed to broaden this focus to include ecological theory and models to guide research, intervention design and evaluation. A further challenge to the use of many of the most quoted models and theories is the fact that many are predicated on a model of human cognition that emphasises a 'rational man' approach, which an increasing body of evidence (Which is discussed in section 7) indicates is not now thought to be sufficient for most health marketing and communication purposes , given increasing understanding about the many non -rational decisions and choices that are made by most people in relation to health. 'Rational man' mode ls of behaviour work on the assumption that people seek to do things which will work in their best interests. Choices are assessed rationally in terms of costs and benefits, and then the decision which benefits the individual most is chosen. In some cases this works well, and the standard public health tools can be applied. However , as Halpern et al have detailed three key problems arise with this approach: Often the information available to individuals is not complete and they are therefore unable to reach a fully rational decision . 230 Green J. Ton es K. Health Promotion: Planning and Strategies. Second. London: Sage;2010. 231 Brown D, McWilliam C, Ward -Griffin C. Client -centred empowering partnering in nursing. Journal of Advanced Nursing. 2006 Jan 1;53(2):160 -8. 77 Individuals rarely think in such a linear fashion, and people's wishes and aspirations are sometimes counter -intuitive . Individuals rarely come to decisions in isolation, and the context in which they operate needs to be taken i nto consideration . 232 The above three points seem particularly pertinent to health issues . The next sect ion of this paper considers atte mpts that have been made and research carried out to develop approaches to selecting which models to use in which situa tions and also the development of all encompassing models that seek to set out maps or approaches to understanding and applying models and theories. A number of such frameworks and taxonomies have been developed , for example the work of Abrahams and Mitch ie.233 Andrew Darnton234 has produced some practical guidance for drawing on a wide range of behaviour change models to apply to any given health marketing challenge. He suggests starting with a literature search to identify relevant models and in particular the relevant factors within them. This review should include models which have been specifically developed for individual policy areas and target audiences. Where a model is needed to predict behaviour change, Darnton recommends that empirical data is use d to show how well they predict behaviour change and what elements of the model are most successful in predicting this. A further approach which is particularly useful when empirical data is not available is to revisit the audience insight for reported att itudes, barriers and drivers and use these to help identify relevant models. Reading the research in the light of several models helps ensure that the findings are not just taken at face value, and provides additional theoretical justification for their ad option. Similarly, research data helps isolate the elements of the models which are most relevant for inclusion in subsequent evaluation.235 It is possible and sometimes necessary when constructing behavioural frameworks for health communication and marketin g, to draw on several models and theories, identifying those elements which are of most use in terms of their power to explain the behaviour which is being targeted. These will then form the building blocks around which communications and messaging can be designed and the campaign's success evaluated. This is the approach Darnton recommends to policymakers 236. There will be occasions however, when existing behavioural theory is simply not available or appropriate for every circumstance . In this situation tho se responsible for constructing the behaviour change programme or communication programme will need to build a behavioural framework from scratch. When building a bespoke model or theory to assist in the planning and delive ry of a public health programme a number of factors which have been covered in this section of the paper will need to be considered. Drawing on the content above the last section of this paper sets out a number of new 'proto tools' to assist practitioners and policy makers review, assess and record which e lements and influencing factors o n behavio ur may be of relevance when constructing such a model. 232 Halpern, David and Bates, Clive, Mulgan, Geoff and Aldridge, Stephen with Bates, Greg and Heathfield, Adam, Personal Responsibility and Changing Behaviour: the state of knowledge and its implications for public policy, Prime Minister's Strate gy Unit, Cabi net Office, February 2004 233 Abraham, Charles and Michie, Susan, A taxonomy of behaviour change techniques used in interventions in Health Psychology, 2008 234 Darnton 2008 op.cit. 235 Department of Health Communication Guide 2010 236 Darnton 2008 op.cit. 78 Proto Tool 4 30 Point Summary of Principles that Influence Behaviour Recent findings from a variety of fields of study have all hel ped to expand and enhance our understanding of how and why people behave as they do and what can influence them to either maintain positive social behaviour or, change undesirable social behaviour. This learning gives us a powerful set of principles, which can be used to help design social change interventions. What we now know is that many of our choices and the decisions we make that influence our behaviour, are not the result of active decision making, decisions and choices are often influenced by uncon scious and automatic thinking. These 'decisions' are influenced by our social contexts, emotional engagement, social influence and environmental prompts, and also by factors such as timing, and our physiological state. However, we are capab le of making rational choices. It is well known that when people have a chance to actively consider a problem or, are engaged in thinking through the best course of action, they make better decisions. Such approaches can also have a significant impact on h ow people behave and the choices they make in the future. The following set of principles summarise much of what we currently know about influencing behaviour, drawn from fields of study that include, but are not limited to management, psychology, policy development, economics, design, sociology, biology and communication studies. These principles are clustered under four headings. These clusters while helpful in terms of mapping the range of influences on behaviour need to be viewed with the understandin g that there is a great deal of interaction between all these clusters and the individual p rinciples that sit within them . Potential Intervention Approach External conditions for change 1 People prefer to be involved and engaged . Participatory involvement often creates bigger behavioural change effects. Wherever possible, involve, consult and engage people in the selection, design, delivery and evaluation of interventions . 2 Social relationships are key . Approval and social support have a stron g and persistent influence on behaviour. Working with and through key influencers improves the impact of behaviour change programmes. Use the power of group norms and behaviour to inform and engage people in change, let them know that others are changing a nd use the power of group action. Significant people in a person's social network can be used to influence their behaviour. For example, working through grandparents can be a good way to influence the behaviour of grand children, and the whole family. 3 People influence and are influenced by their physical, social and economic environments . There is a limit to a person's capacity to change if their environment militates against this. It is often necessary to deliver programmes that tackle the underlying environmental, social and economic barriers to change as well as personal factors. 79 4 People can be helped to change by designing services, procedures and environments that encourage people to act in a way that does not involve complex decision making. Design services and environments that encourage behaviours by removing the need for complex choices, for example making only low or non -alcoholic drinks available at soci al functions will encourage less people to get drunk. Removing unhealthy choices or other socially harmful options is often called 'choice editing '. Internal conditions for change 5 A desire or at least an acceptance for change in the target audience will enhance efforts to bring about change . It is possible to enforce change that people do not support or actively oppose but there is a bigger chance of success if a target audience can be persuaded of the validity, necessity and plausibility of change . 6 Beliefs and va lues have a strong influence on how people behave . Programmes should start by understanding the target audience beliefs and attitudes and use these to inform the development of behaviour change, systems and environmental change, communication tactics and pro ducts that will assist change. 7 Behaviour is influenced by physiological and somatic state . If people are physically aroused this will often have an impact on their behaviour. Tiredness, physical arousal, anger, joy or a sens e of relaxation will all have an impact on behaviour. People's somatic state, for example the shape of their body and how they perceive it will also have an impact on their behaviour. People who perceive themselves to be fat often don't exercise because t heir weight impacts on their enjoyment . 8 Genetics can have an influence on behaviour ; For example, there are some differences in the way men and women as a population , if not individuals behave differently in specific situations. For example, m any young men are aggressive because they have high levels of testosterone . 9 People are often motivated to do the 'right thing' for the community as well as themselves and their families. Interventions that appeal to people's sense of being good, for example, fairness, justice and community togetherness can be powerful. Programmes that stress that the behaviour is one that is a norm in the communit y and one that is valued by others also tend to be more successful . 10 People's perception of their own ability to change can either enhance or detract from attempts to change . Programmes can be developed that focus on providing support that will build people's confidence and knowledge and skills. F or example, teaching people how to recycle in a hands on way can increase both their understanding and confidence about recycling behaviour . 11 People often use mental short cuts and trial -and-error approache s to make decisions, rather than 'rational' decision making . An understanding of these short cuts or 'heuristics' should be used to develop interventions. For example, if people explain their view of the causes of unemployment as being due to new people mo ving into their area and taking all the jobs, it is possible with this insight to develop and suggest to them new heuristics such as, new people who move in take some jobs but they also spend money and so create more job s. 80 Barriers to change 12 Habit is a key barrier in many change processes . People can be locked into patterns of behaviour and need practical help to break free or 'unfreeze' current behaviour. Programmes that provide practical support to change , are easy to access and those that require small first steps, tend to be more effective. Sometimes it may be necessary to 'unfreeze ' long established behaviour by confronting the problem in a direct and rob ust manner. 13 Change is more likely if an undesired behaviour is not part of an individual's coping strategy . Avoid 'telling people off' for 'bad' behaviour if they are using it to cope with life. Demonstrate an understanding of the reasons for their behaviour and offer realistic and attractive al ternatives that give practical support to change . 14 People's perception of their vulnerability to a risk and its severity is key to understanding behaviour and developing effective interventions. Programme developers should focus on understanding people' s perceptions and how they view the risks associated with the behaviour that is to be targeted. It is also necessary to frame risks in ways that people can understand and are meaningful to them. The way that information is framed can have a big impact on b ehaviour. As an example people are more likely to decide to have an operation if they are told there is a 90% chance of success as opposed to being told that 10% of peop le die who have the operation. 15 People's perception of the e ffectiveness of the rec ommended behavioural change is a key factor in decisions to act . This means that we need to set out in terms that people value the effectiveness and benefits of the change that is being promoted . 16 People are over optimistic . Most people tend to believe that something good will happen or that possible negative consequences of actions or situations will not happen to them. People tend to overestimate their chances of being fortunate. This means that we need to communicate in terms that people can understand the probabilities of both negative and positive consequences of social behaviour. 17 Many people are bad at computation and risk assessment . Many of us do not understand numbers, risk ratios, odds or even percentages. Prog ramme planners should always test the use and understanding of numerical and risk based messages before using them. It is best to convey risks and factual numerical information in ways that the target audience can both understand and find compelling. For e xample, the number of Olympic sized swimming pools full of water that can be saved by fitting a low volume flush toilet is more understandable than a numeric number of gallons . Triggers to change 18 Change is more likely if the actions that have to be taken are easy, specific, simple and clear . Keep interventions specific and promote them in a way that the target audience views as relevant and appealing. For example, rather than general appeals to promote civic engagement it is better to work to brin g about specific behavioural change in areas such as the number of people who sign up to do voluntary work for a specific charity or NGO. 19 Making the first step to change 'easy ' helps engage people in the change process . Making the first step to change easy encourages more people to start a behaviour because the initial commitment is small and in so doing reduces the inbuilt status quo bias that many people have. People also like to be consistent, once they have started on a change path, with a small step they are more likely to continue with bigger changes. For example, asking people to donate 81 a very small amount will increase the chance that they will donate more the next time they are asked to do so . 20 People can be taught critical thinking and appraisal skills that can help them take more control over their behaviour and resist media, social and environmental influences . Active consideration of a change issue often leads to more permanent change. If people have a chance to explore and consider issues, this often helps them both reconsider attitudes and beliefs. This can help them change their behaviour or maintain a positive behaviour. Critical thinking skills once taught also begin to have an impact in many other are as of a person's life beyond the original focus of a programme and so can have many beneficial spin off effects in terms of promoting social good. 21 Behavioural experiences can influence beliefs and values . Programmes that move people to experiencing a behaviour as quickly as possible for example, giving them a chance to try the thing that is being promoted work best. It is not always necessary to rely on shifting attitude first. Behaving differently often leads to a shift in attitude. For example, provi ding a financial reward to recycle in the short term can increase recycling behaviour even when the incentive is removed . 22 The more beneficial or rewarding an experience, the more likely it is to be repeated . Maintaining positive behaviour can be assist ed by reinforcement. Behavioural interventions should seek to reward desired behaviours and when appropriate penalise inappropriate behaviour. Interventions should also seek to support positive behaviour by maintaining a relationship with people which affi rms their new behaviour and e ncourages them to build on it. 23 Change in behaviour is usually a process not an event and often entails several attempts before success. When delivering intervention programmes there is a need to be persistent, sustain inte rventions over time and offer multiple paths to success. It is also important to design in the possibility of multiple attempts to change and sup port for every attempt ed change. 24 People are loss averse. We will put more effort into retaining what we have than acquiring new assets or benefits. Therefore it is important to stress potential losses associated with the behaviour as well as the positive gains that can be accrued from change. Many people are of ten more concerned with short -term gains and costs, and tend to place less value on rewards or costs that might happen in the future. Programmes should emphasise short -term as well as long-term benefits and seek to reduce short -term costs. For example, whe n seeking to encourage young people not to get sun burnt emphasising immediate damage to their appearance as well as the longer term risk of skin cancer can be an effective strategy. 25 People perceive themselves to be and wish to appear to be consistent in their attitudes, beliefs and actions . This preference for consistency can be used to help people change. For example, if we ask people to make a public declaration to do something they are more likely to do it. People like to be consistent and when the y have made a public commitment or pledge to act in a certain way, this pledge helps them to stick with the thing they have committed to, for example, getting someone to write down their next appointment on a card rather than doing it for them is a way to increase the likelihood that they will attend. People are also influenced by people that they like and can relate to. Liking is a key factor in how influential someone is on another person's behaviour. Liking is related to a sense of commonality with a person, a sense of being appreciated and listened to, and the exchange of compliments. Spokes person's, front line staff and representatives can be trained to develop their ability to foster good relationships with target audiences by demonstrating these char acteristics. 26 People are influenced by authority figures . We are influenced by people that we perceive have legitimate authority by virtue of their status, position and/or physical characteristics. When using authority figures it is also important to test that they are perceived as having this status by the spe cific target audience of a programme. 82 27 People will usually change behaviour if they value what is being offered or in the case of a negative penalty that the penalty has meaning and significant consequences for them . Offers and penalties need to be presented in a way that people find meaningful and understandable. They should also be proportionate and seen to be fair. Rewards also need to be seen as desirable and do not necessarily have to have a large monetary value. For example, giving people who a ttend a cardiac rehabilitation service a different colour badge or pin as they graduate each stage of a class ca n act as a powerful incentive. 28 Communications and media including social media can have a powerful effect on people's attitudes, beliefs and consequently behaviour . However, this effect is not only confined to information transmission. The real impact of mass and social media on people is often more subtle. Media can build up impressions of relationships between issues, set the agenda for publ ic debate and create emotional responses a s well as transmit information. 29 People often exhibit decision and choice fatigue , and prefer not to have to act or make large numbers of complex decisions. Interventions can be designed that make the 'good' ch oice the easy and desired choice. For example, having a system that automatically enrols you into a social beneficial scheme rather than having to make an active choice to do so will increase the number of people who enter the scheme. 30 Feedback is a po werful way to assist people to change . Feedback is a special type of incentive and reward. It can be used to encourage people and provide them with additional help, guidance and support. Feedback in verbal, written or via direct physical instruction helps to sustain change. For example, using check lists, diaries and review meetings are all ways of both recording actions and providing a record that can be used to structure feedback and decide how future progress can be achieved. 83 Proto T ool 5 Key I nfluencing Factors Check L ist Based on the most frequently utilised behavioural models and theories for public health communications and the preceding papers included in this sect ion of the paper , the following proto tool suggests an analysis of factors that often influence human behaviour as the starting point for understanding how a health behaviour might be influenced by communication and marketing programmes . This tool sets out many of the key factors that should be considered when designi ng a health communication or behaviour change programme. Influencing Factor SUMMARY Relevance to the Selected Intervention Understanding Investigate w hat the audience understand about the behaviour and what do they not understand. How is this understanding demonstrated ? Conscious and Unconscious Decision Making Analyse how the target audience makes decisions in respect of the behaviour. Are choices the result of unconscious rapid cognition or more considered choices? Intention To make a successful behaviour change an individual must form a strong positive intention or make a commitment to performing the behaviour. Motivation How motivated are the target audiences and what is the source and nature of their motivation . Heuristics and biases What psychological biases, beliefs and heuristics scripts are influencing the target group in relation to the behaviours to be influenced? 84 Environmental Barriers and Enabling Factors Identify perceived and actual barriers or enabling factors in the environment affecting the target behaviour. Skills An individual will need to possess the necessary skills to carry out the behaviour. Identify the specific s kills need ed and h ow prevalent they are in the target population . Attitudes A positive attitude towards the behaviour change, particularly a belief that the advantage of making the change will outweigh the disadvantages, is an important step on the way to behaviour change. Social Norms and Customs The influences of support group s, as well as wider social influences in promoting behaviour change are important for programme planning and evaluation. Understanding the perceived attitudes of friends, family and 'society' w ill also be important . Social Networks and Support Identify social support networks, social capital and social assets that are available to prompt or ma intain targeted behaviours and attitudes. Self-image Assess if the change being promoted is consistent with an indiv idual's self -perception and self image. Emotion An individual's reaction to performing the behaviour change needs to be more positive than negative, so perceived emotion before performing the chan ge and actual emotion once trialling it are good indicators of likelihood to continue with the behaviour change . 85 Agency and Self -efficacy An individual's belief that they are able to make and sustain the behaviour change. Assess the extent of self effica cy in relation to the target behaviour. Habit Identify what habitual patterns exist amongst target audiences and what triggers and maintains them. Identify potential break or change points . Physiological S tate Identify what somatic, hormonal, or genetic factors including age and gender impact on the behavioural issue. The Public A genda Identify what issues in the public discourse space and media are influencing or could influence attitudes beliefs and behaviour. Value / E xchange Assess what value the target audience place on an existing patter n of behaviour and what level of value would need to be offered and in what form to produce a change. 86 Towards Developing an Integrated Theoretical Framework to Assist Planning and D elivery Introduction : As described in the previous section there are a large number of behavio ural theories and models that can be used to i nform the design and evaluation of effective and efficient pandemic communication and behavioural influencing strategies. Th ere is clearly a strong case for the application of theory in the development of interventions to change behaviour as stated in the MRC review of complex interventions states : 237 The rationale for a complex intervention, i.e. what changes are expected, and how change is to be achieved, may not be clear at the outset. If so, a vitally important early task is to develop a theoretical understanding of the likely process of change, by drawing on existing evidence and theory, supplemented if necessary by new primary research, for example interviews with 'stakeholders', i.e. those targeted by the intervention, or involved in its development or delivery. This should be done whether you are developing the intervention you are planning to evaluate, or evaluating a n intervention that has already been developed and/or implemented. As stated in the previous section there may be lots of competing or partly overlapping theories, that can be used and as Noar and Zimmerman make clear the use of many models to increas e understanding is a useful approach 238 however selecting the most appropriate theory and models or elements of them will require the input of expertise from the relevant disciplines.239 240. The review consideration and selection of an appropriate theoretical foundation for a pandemic communication and behavioural intervention is then a matter of some importance for a least three reasons. As Michie et al 241 states : \"There are three main reasons for advocating the use of theory in designing interventions. First, interventions are likely to be more effective if they target causal determinants of behaviour and behaviour change; this requires understanding these causal determinants, i.e. theoretical mechanisms of change. Second, theory can be test ed and developed by evaluations of interventions only if those interventions and evaluations are theoretically informed. 237 Medi cal Research Council (MRC) Developing and evaluating complex interventions: new guidance.

However, there is often little guidance about how to develop theory -based interventions and theory appears frequently to be used in a non -systematic way or is simply used to inform rather than guide the development of programmes. There have however , been a few attempts to provide some guidance in this area. One of the first attempts made by practitioners to provide a unifying framework of various behaviour change influences is the US National Institute of Mental Health, who convened a theorist's workshop to work through the key factors influencing behaviour and behaviour change.242 Drawing on this, below are the key concepts which reoccur in the models and theories reviewed. ELEMENT SUMMARY Intention To make a successful behaviour change an individual must form a strong positive intention or make a commitment to performing the behaviour. Therefore some measure of intention should be included in the evaluation programme . Environmental Const raints Barriers in an individual's environment may make behaviour change difficult, so a measure of perceived and/or actual barriers should be a key part of any evaluation programme . Skills An individual will need to possess the necessary skills to car ry out the behaviour, so a measure of perceived skill level combined with usage and awareness of any support and education tools is an important element in any evaluation programme . Attitudes A positive attitude towards the behaviour change, particularly a belief that the advantage of making the change will outweigh the disadvantages, is an important step on the way to behaviour change. Evaluating attitudes and monitoring changes are therefore important measures . 242 Fishbein, M, Bandura, A, Triandis, HC, et al, Factors influencing behaviour and behaviour change: Final report, Theorists workshop, National Institute of Mental Health, 1992 88 Social N orms The influences of an individual's immediate support group as well as wider social influences in promoting the behaviour change are an important indicator for evaluation. Measuring the perceived attitudes of friends, family and 'society' could act as a proxy indicator he re. Self-Image The behaviour change needs to be consistent with an individual's self -image, so a way of capturing firstly self -image and matching this with perception of the behaviour change will be useful . Emotion An individual's reaction to perform ing the behaviour change needs to be more positive than negative, so perceived emotion before performing the change and actual emotion once trialling it are good indicators of likelihood to continue with the behaviour change . Self-Efficacy An individual's capabilities to perform the behaviour change in a range of circumstances and their belief in this are important in many of the models, so a measurement of perceived and actual capability is often key in evaluation . This summary list seek s to concentrate the planners mind on the key elements that need t o be considered when developing an intervention. The question of how these key elements can and should be applied was addressed in a review commissioned by the UK Government in 2008. The UK Social Research Unit (GSR) 243 commissioned a review to clarify the use of models of behaviour change for research analysts , with the intention of improving advice to policy makers seeking to influence behaviour related to social programmes and the evaluatio n of such programmes. The review was designed to: o Provide an overview of relevant models and theories . o Provide guidance on their uses and limits. While the review started from the point of providing an introduction to behaviour change theory, it resulted in the development of practical guidance for analysts and policy makers and practitioners. The review made a clear distinction between models of behaviour and theories of change . Models of behaviour were defined as being primarily helpful in enha ncing understanding about specific behaviours, by identifying the underlying factors which influence them. Theories of change show how behaviours change over time, and can be changed. The report also makes it clear that these two bodies of theory are complementary, understanding both is necessary in order to develop effective approaches to behaviour 243 GSR Behaviour Change Knowledge Review. Overview of Behaviour Change Models and their Uses. Briefing Note for Policy Makers. Darnton A. Centre for Sustainable Development, University of Westminster 2008. 89 change. The report also sets out guidance that behavioural models should be regarded as concepts for helping to understand behaviours , rather than recipes for bringing about behaviour change and models should not be adopted uncritically rather they are starting points for analysis and testing. The GSR report recommends that policy makers should adopt an approach to intervention development which embeds behavi oural models in a process shaped by theories of change. The selection of relevant behavioural models can suggest the key factors to work on and theories of change suggest a developmental process should be adopted based on audience engagement, piloting, and on-going monitoring and adaptation. The report also makes it clear that there is no algorithm that can be appl ied to select models or theories and ultimately, a theory -based approach needs to be flexible to take account of different behaviour al contexts a nd audience groups. This should also incorporate learning from practice, having identified what works in comparable interventions. However , the report argues for effort to be put into underpinning and developing a theoretical framework , for all social po licy intervention s focu sed on influenci ng behaviour , as theoretical modelling is needed to develop clear and measurable objectives and outcomes. In the GSR review Darnton recommends that empirical data is used to show how well they predict behaviour cha nge and what elements of the model are most successful in predicting this. A further approach is recommended which is particularly useful when empirical data is not available. This is to revisit the audience insight for reported attitudes, barriers and dri vers and use these to help identify relevant models. Reading the research in the light of several models helps ensure that the findings are not just taken at face value, and provides additional theoretical justification for their adoption. Similarly, resea rch data helps isolate the elements of the models which are most relevant for inclusion in subsequent evaluation. The review sets out nine principles in a logical seque nce, but makes clear that they should not be regarded as discrete steps, with one being accomplished before moving on to the next. Instead the principles can be best understood as a staged but iterative process . Importantly in terms of policy coherence the cyclical nature of the Nine Principles is also in keeping with existing guidance on po licy evaluation, such as the ROAMEF model in the Green Book 244 which demonstrates how research can support effective delivery throughout the policy cycle. 244 HM Treasury. The Green Book. Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government. London. TSO. 2011. 90 The GSR Nine Principles are: 1. Identify the audience groups and the target behaviour . If faced with a complex behaviour , break it down into its component behaviours and/or adopt a systems thinking approach . 2. Identify relevant behavioural models (use both individual - and societal level models). Draw up a shortlist of infl uencing factors . 3. Select the key infl uencing factors use these to design objectives in a draft strategy for the intervention . 4. Identify effective intervention techniques which have worked in the past on the infl uencing factors selected . 5. Engage the target audience for t he intervention in order to understand the target behaviour and the factors infl uencing it from their perspective . 6. Develop a prototype intervention based on the learning from working with the actors. Cross -check this against appropriate policy framewor ks and assessment tools. Pilot the intervention and monitor continuously . 8. Evaluate impacts and processes . 9. Feedback learning from the evaluation . The Nine Principles resemble existing theory -based guidance for planning interventions, but aim to achieve a synthesis between the different approaches. The key difference between the Nine Principles and other approaches such as social marketing and Gardner and Stern's Principles (in Stern 2000)245 is the building of behavioural models into the heart of the developing process. The Nine Principles can also be compared to the Intervention Mapping (IM) framework, which similarly centres on behavioural models, but which follows a more programmatic path to intervention development and implementation (Bartholome w et al 1998)246. The GSR review principle s can the n be used to locate theory at the heart of the intervention planning process. Another useful framework for considering the selection and place of behaviour change theory is work by Abraham and Michie, wh o have developed a taxonomy of terms used in behaviour change interventions to create a standardised terminology and a meta model they term the 'Behaviour Change Wheel' that seeks to encapsulate sources of behavioural influence, a spectrum of intervention functions and a set of policy categories. From a review of techniques used in physical activity interventions, 26 behaviour change techniques were identified, 18 of which are taken from generic behaviour change theories.247 Mitchie and et al contend that there are three groups of behavioral change theories. Those that relate to motivation, those that relate to action and those that relat e to organisational change. E.g. : 245 Stern, P 2000. Towards a Coherent Th eory of Environmentally Signifi cant Behaviour . Journal of Social Issues 56 (3), 407 -424. 246 Barthol omew, K, G Parcel and G Kok 1998.

Action: Explains the behaviour of people who have identified a need to change, e.g. Control Theory/Self -regulation Theory . Organisati onal: Explains 'institution' level change, e.g. Diffusion of Innovation Theory . Mitch ie et al248 undertook a consensus study to develop an integrated model of behaviour change theory which involved an analysis of 33 theories and 128 constructs generated which were subsequently simplified into 12 domains of theoretical constructs. 1. Knowledge . 2. Skills . 3. Professional role and identity . 4. Beliefs about capabilities . 5. Beliefs about consequences . 6. Motivation and goals . 7. Memory, attention and decision processes . 8. Environmental context and resources . 9. Social influences . 10. Emotion . 11. Action plans . 12. Nature of the behaviour . Mitch ie et al have set out what they call the \" COM -B system\" which stands for: Capability, Motivation (Which is divided into reflective and automatic consideration) and Opportunity , all of which should be considered when developing a behavioural intervention. Mitchie et al have gone on to develop a more sophisticated framework called the 'Be haviour Change Wheel' 249 based on previous analysis o f theory and a trawl of 19 behaviour change planning and intervention frameworks, see fig ure 1: 248 Mitchie S et al (2005) Making psychological theory useful for implementing evidence based practice: a consensus approach, Quality and Safety in Health Care, 14, 26 -38. 249 Michie S, Stralen M. Wes t R. The behaviour change wheel: A new method for characterising and designing behaviour change interventions Implement Sci. 2011; 6: 42. Published online -6-42. PMCID: PMC3096582 92 Figure 1 The 'Behaviour Change Wheel ' has at its centre what Mitchie et al call the 'Sources of Behaviour ', set out under the three COM -B headings of Motivation (Sources : Automatic and Reflective), Opportunity (Sources ; Social and Physical) and Capability (Sources: P hysical and Psychological). The ' Behaviour Change Wheel' makes a clear distinction between 'behavioural interventions' and 'p olicies' that enable or support those interventions. The next layer of the model sets out nine types of intervention activities that can be used to i nfluence behaviour. These are: E ducation, Persuasion, Incentivisation, Coercion, Tr aining, Enablement, Mode lling, E nvironmental Restructuring and Restrictions. The final element of the model is the policy enabling outer ring that consists of six possible policy approaches to enable or support each , or combinations of the possible nine intervention typ es. The po licy approaches are: Environmental/Social Planning, Communications/ Marketing, Legislation, Service Provision, Regulation, Fiscal Measures and Guidelines. Mitchie et al agree with Darnton that when developing effective interventions it is necessary to sta rt with a deep analysis of the target group and behaviour including a precise description of its determinants prior to model selection or development. The next step in any systematic process should be to consider the full range of possible interventions an d policies before i dentifying specific behaviour change techniques and communication strategies to bring about change. The 'Behaviour Change Wheel ' is one of the more comprehensive attempts to date to synthesise a great deal of previous work on theory and behavioral change intervention modelling. Like other attempts to present a totalising model however there are obvious critical questions regarding the exact categorisation of elements and definitions of the concepts selected. The model also has a number of fairly obvious intervention and policy omissions such as design, community development etc. The conflation of types of decision making a (A utomati c and Reflective) with influences of behaviour is also problematic. With regard to the focus of the E -Com project the out of date definition of marketing employed within the model is also a major weakness as it both conflates communication and marketing and categorises t hem as 'policy' whereas as explored in latter sections of this paper social marketing is conceded by most commentators to be an integral part of every stage of policy development, research, strategy formulation delivery and evaluation. Howev er, the model like others in this section is a helpful conceptual tool, and like other models set out in this paper , research will be needed to establish how far the 'Behavio ur Change Wheel ' can lead to more efficient selection and design of effective inte rventions. 93 One useful advantage of the 'Behaviour Change Wheel ' model is that it seeks to bring together behavioral influencing factors with potential forms of intervention. A number of other models have also been developed to set out models of interventi on approaches. One of the most commonly quoted is the DEFRA 4 E's model of pro -environmental behaviour influence 250. French et al 251 have also set out for the UK National Social Marketing centre what is known as the DECIDES model of five types of behavio ural intervention clusters. These and other models seek to add descriptive models of intervention options and operational delive ry considerations to considerations of models of behavio ural influence and processes of change. 250 DEFRA A framework for pro environmental behaviour.

Theory and Practice. Oxford University Press. 2010 94 Conclusion This section of the paper has reviewed a small selection of approaches to the selection of theoretical models and the setting out of how behavio ural theory and interventions can be conceptualised. An integrative approach seeks to recognise and value different theoretical disciplines and perspectives, each of which has potential to help explain and provide potential insight into what is happening and why and how key influences on behaviour can be used to influe nce how people act. To adopt an integrative approach rather than a single default theoretical perspective and apply this to all situations is clearly necessary to consider and integrate understanding from a wide range of academic and applied fields. To assist the process of conceptual ising the range of theories and key domains of in fluence the following two proto -tools have been developed , based on the key reference documents quoted in this and pr evious sections of the paper. It is intended that these proto -tools have been developed fo r testing in latter stages of the E -Com project to guide the selection and application of theory and models of behavio ur change. 95 Proto T ool 6 Open Analysis Approach to Selecting M odels and Theories of Behaviour C hange The following four domains of influence appear to be key when selecting theory and models of behaviour: Bio-physical e.g. Biology Psychological e.g. Psychology Social e.g. Sociology Environmental and Economic e.g. Environmental S tudies and Economics Step One: Recognise the M ultiple Influences on B ehaviour For each of these four domains there are a range of disciplines that inform or are grounded in that perspective. Each of these disciplines has their own range of theories and ideas about what influences behaviour and often each feeder discipline has a numb er of competing or antagonistic theories. The first step in the process is to accept the influences from these four domains and begin a review of potential influences on behaviour from this perspective. Using this frame of reference potential models and t heories can be sought that inform understanding about the impact of each of these four domains on behaviour. This first stage should be as unrestricted as possible; theory should be sought not just from each domain but also from fields of behavioral infl uence outside public health. Valuable models and lessons can be learnt from field s such as environmental beha vioural influence, transport use , financial deci sion making and planning and fro m areas outside the immunisation and pandemic preparedness fields ; for example for the fields of smoking, obesity and accident prevention. 96 Step Two : Assemble a Multi -Disciplinary T eam There is also a need to be pragmatic and recognise that it is impossible for practitioners to be expected to have detailed understanding of so many disciplines and theories and to conduct exhaustive reviews of theory prior to any strategy or action being delivered. One way to reduc e the effort required and to increase the theoretical frame of reference that can be applied to understanding particular issues is the tactic of bringing together multi - disciplinary teams from different backgrounds. This approach will increase the range of theoretical models that will be applied in any given situation. Each profession within the public sector has its own assumptions abou t how behaviour is best changed and how best it can be built into their policies, be it through information giving; education; regulation; service provision, or 'enabling' measures. Some professions assume that the public make rational choices based on evidence, while others recognize that users are often troubled, or emotional. For example trading standards works through r egulation and enforcement, while planners may try to 'design in' behaviour change (e.g. building flats without car parking spaces to discourage car use) , while children's services may put more emphasis on talking, interaction, support and advice. Recognisi ng and understanding these different approaches is a first step to making good choices about which approach to use in each situation. 97 Step Three : Apply an Open Analysis rather than a start from Fixed I deas or a Fixed T heory As discussed above and recommended in the 2008 GSR review if theory is to be used to inform practice it is necessary first to start by trying to get a clear understanding of 'what' behaviour is occurring, and what different people know, think and feel abou t it. Before then going on to 'pull -down' theory to consider what might help inform or develop insight into why people are adopting a behaviour and the potential insights that might provide ways for effectively intervening. In this way a focus on the behav iour drives the development of a theoretical perspective rather than the other way round. The final stages of step three should involve the development of 'working propositions' for how to achieve and or maintain the desired behaviour that is bein g focused on. These propositions will be based on existing and possible newly devised models of behavio ur drawn from the literatur e but also form what is understood about the target audience and what influences the behaviour in question. Interventions can then be developed based on these propositions and tested in p ilots and field trials to see if they deliver the anticipated impact on behaviour. 98 Proto Tool 7 Principles for Designing I nterventions Informed by T heory and Models of Behaviour C hange (Base on the an amalgamation of GSR review 252 Abraham & Mitchie 253 recommendations and STELA planning model254) Task Responsible Agent Time frame State of Comp letion Identify audience/s for the intervention.

Information provision, whether through advertisements, leaflets or labelling, must be backed up by other approaches .\"255 New Understanding from Behavioural Research, Psychology and E conomics Introduction This section of the paper reviews new developments in theory an d practice related to behaviour change coming from the field of behavioural economics. The section gives a general introduction to the scope of behavio ural economics and sets out some of the tactical and strategic implications fo r public health programmes and how these are being applied. The limitations of the traditional or neo -classical economic theory and its impact of behavioural change theory and practice Policy makers and many public health leaders have tended to consider human behaviour to be mode lled on many of the theories of traditional or neo -classical economics. These theories assumed that humans are rational beings isolated fro m one another who tend to behave logically to financial and social incentives and disincentives , the term 'Rational M an' approach is often used as shorthand for this theory . Neo-classical economic analysis models the way in which people are expected to behave in order to predict/assess the impact of a given intervention on the desired outcome. The theory postulates that people undertake a form of 'cost benefit analysis' weighing up of the costs and benefits (or pain and pleasure?) of a number of choices and then select ing the option that will maximise the net utility. Poor choices according to t hese theories often spring from lack of relevant or important information. Classical economists often talk in this regard of 'Information A symmetry' distorting markets and ration al decision making. In terms of pandemic health promotion programmes this conception of human motivation gets translated into the search for the best ways to communicate risk and prevention strategies that maximise personal benefits and benefits to a perso ns close family and friends. In common with this standard approach to economic theory and many of the older social psychological models (reviewed in section five of this paper) work on the assumption that human behaviour is intentional, considered and con sistent with our beliefs and attitudes. These assumptions often result in linear views of behaviour, such as those in which beliefs 255 Jackson. Motivating Sustainable Consumption - a review of evidence on consumer behaviour and behavioural change. http://www.sd -research.org.uk/documents/MotivatingSCfinal.pdf , , 2005 101 lead to attitudes, which inform intentions, which result in behaviours, for example social learning theory. This way of thin king often reinforces information dominated interventions, which aim to change attitude s, on the assumption that attitude change will lead to a change in behaviour (see section four of this paper for a more detailed review of the strengths and limitations of such approaches) . It is the case however , that in many public health challenges this assumption has been shown no t to be the case; for example most people know that smoking is bad for them but they still do it. Traditional economic theory also does not make any value judgments about the validity of people's preferences; it is not interested in trying to explain where people's preferences come from (something which psychologists and sociol ogists are keenly interested in ). Therefore it does not take into account the way we interact with others i.e. the direct influence of others behaviour, reciprocation, and the emotions that others provoke in us, such as envy. Once people have a set of preferences, these are assumed to be relatively fixed over time, until people are given an incentive, then people will make a choice that maximises their utility given their resources. In this way, financial rewards or incentives are always expected to encourage behaviour, while financial fines or sanctions are expected to d iscourage certain behaviours. Examples of incentives and sanctions being used in this way include such public health interventions as speeding fines for driving too fast. Although standard economic theory is good at explaining short -term decision -making, i t is often less good at explaining longer -term changes in preferences and it is not good analysing why certain policies don't work. The rational man approach that underp ins neo-classical economic theory has a key weakness in that it ignores the complexities or imperfections of human nature and decision making. People do not always have ac cess to a full range of relevant information, and even if they do, people are not always capable of systematically processing this informati on in order to make the most rational choice. People are also influenced by other factors such as other s behaviour, emotions and habit . The risk of relying on an approach that does not take into account these complexities is that it may lead to unrealistic analysis of what a policy intervention should be and is capable of. Traditionally, the focus for many public health polici es has been to change behaviour using external drivers such as information provision financial incentives (e.g. taxes, subsidies, a nd conditional cash payments ; for example provision of chil d benefits if a child receives the recommen ded vaccination schedule) and regulation (e.g. prohibiting certain actions, setting standards for example only allowing vacc inated children to start schoo l). However, incorporating a wider understanding of behaviour (both individual and societal) reco gnises the importance of intra and inter -personal drivers and the points of influence. Traditional external approaches will always be key policy tools but the effectiveness of policy interventions would also appe ar to be dependent on understanding and reflecting what is known about internal processes of decision making and action , much of which lies outside the rational domain. Recent developments in economi c and behavioral theory are now shedding new light on how many decisions are made in non -rational ways and how this new understanding can be used to build more effective and efficient programmes. These developments highlight the need to pay much more atten tion to non -rational decision making processes (e.g. desires, habits, emotions and unconscious mental short cuts,) and a much wider range of external 102 social influencers (e.g. interpersonal relationships, social norms and social systems) on shaping behaviou r. Figure 1 (from the Social Market Foundation) provides a useful overview of such an expanded spectrum of behavioural factors with an indicative range of options and tools associated with different types. Figure 1: Factors in Human B ehaviour Source: From Prendergast et al, Creatures of Habit , SMF This model is helpful in that it illustrates th at human behaviour is influenced by external, internal and social factors all of which can involve both rational but also other forms of non - rational action such as habit based behaviours. Whilst the rational conceptualisation of human motivation has always been viewed as an over simplification even by economists , but it has over the last fifteen or so years been subject to increasing challenge s due to a rapid growth in evidence and experimental studies from a wide range of social and behavioural sciences. N otably from the new field of study entitled 'behavioural economics' which draws on insights from economic , sociology, psychology, neuroscience and other behavioural sciences such as evolutionary biology. 103 The Nature and Scope of Behavioural E conomics As stated above the traditional m odel of ration al decision -making inherent in neo -classic economic theory has underpinned much public health work. As also stated above , two key assumptions about human behaviour underpin standard economic analysis, (also referred to as the 'rational man' approach) 256 i. People seek to maximise their own utility (or in other words seek to further their own interest) . ii. People act rationally (People are fully capable of accessing and systematically processing the range of information available to them and in weighing up this information are able to make the best choice from the many possible choices available to them). Behavioural economics has emerged as a challenge to the neo-classical economic theory and its assumption of rationality. Behavioural economics accepts that pe ople are irrational but believes that this irrationality can be understood and predicted and therefore can be used in both economic and social change programmes. Behavioural Economics has been defined as: 'The combination of psychology and economics that i nvestigates what happens in markets in which some agents display human limitations and complications .'257 Behavioural economics takes issue with the standard neoclassical economic model based on rational man theory by using insights form experimentation and observation to build new explanations about how human behaviour is in fact very different from this model. These additions to the neo -classical model include , but are not limited to the assertions that: 1. People, exhibit bounded rationalit y, they are not alw ays rational. 2. People often make systematic mistakes. 3. People have limited willpower which gets rapidly used up if continuously chall enged. 4. People avoid making complicated decisions . 5. People often make choices that are inconsistent over time. 6. People prefer fairness and are willing to pay for it. 7. People are influen ced by how choices are 'Framed'. 8. People tend to be ov erconfident and over optimistic. 9. People are risk averse. Behavioural economics recognises that people are inconsistent flawed decision makers and that people make decisions based on 'unreliable facts', such as previous personal experience and beliefs a bout the trustworthiness of sou rces of information. Interestingly behavio ural econom ics theory has been underpinned by the two people who are no t economists who have won Nobel prizes for economi cs. B ased on h is earlier work Herbert Simon ( political scienti st) put forward the concept of 'B ounded Rationality,' 258 259 arguing that rational thought alone did not explain huma n decision -making. Then , Danie l Kahneman, with Amos Tversky (Psychologists) published \"Prospect Theory 260 An \"Analysis of Decision Under Risk \". This was a key paper on how people handle decisions about 256 Presentation by John Guest (University of Coventry) at GES Seminar on Behavioural Economics May 2007.

His papers on human information -processing and problem - solving 260 Kahneman, D l ; Ed Diener (2003). Well-being: the foundations of hedonic psycho logy Russell Sage Foundation 104 uncertain rewards and risks. The authors argued that the ways in which alternatives are framed , not simply their relative value , heavily influence the decisions people make. This was a semina l paper in behavio ural economics that set out a clear challenge t o the neoclassical model s view that people simply and logically want to maximise personal benefit . A good example with direct bearing on pandemic event management of this 'framing effect ' is illustrated by the following example. In a 1981 Science paper , \"The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice,\" Tversky and Kahneman presented the following example: \"Imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease which is expected to kill 600 people . Two alternative program mes to combat the disease have been proposed. \"Choose Program me A, and a projected 200 people will be saved. Choose Program me B, and there is a one -third probability that 600 people will be saved, and a two -thirds probability that no one will be saved. The authors reported that 72% of respondents chose Program me A, although the actual outcomes of the two program mes are identical. Most subjects were risk averse, preferring the certain saving of 200 lives. The researchers then restated the problem: this time, with Program me C: Choose Programme C \"400 people will die,\" whereas with Program me D, \"there is a one -third probability that no one will die, and a two -thirds probability that 600 people will die.\" This time, 78% chose Program D \u2014again, despite identical outcomes. Respondents now preferred the risk -taking option. The difference was simply that the first problem phrased its options in terms of lives saved , and the second one in terms of lives lost. People are more w illing, apparently, to take risks to prevent lives being \"lost\" than to \"save\" lives . 261 In 200 0 Stanovich & West added to the debate with their description of two distinct systems of cognition that influence decisi on making based on emerging experimental studies from the world of social psychology and empirical studies f rom the world of brain imaging. They describe these systems as : Systems One and Systems Two262. System One is more intuitive, reactive, quick and holistic. In System One thinking, we rely on a number of heuristics (C ognitive manoeuvres and short cuts), situational prompts, readily associated ideas, and vivid memories to arrive fast and con fident decisions . 'System 1' thinking is particularly helpful in routine situations when time is short and immediate action is necessary . While System 1 is functioning, another powerful system is also at work, that is, unless people specifically shut it down by for example drinking a lot of alcohol. System 2 is the more reflective thinking system that people used for making judgments when they find them selves in unfamiliar or complex situations and also have 261 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral economics 262 Stanovich K & West R.. Individual differences in reasoning: Implications for the rationality debate? Behavioural And Brain Sciences 23, 645 -726. 2000 105 more time to weigh options cost and benefits of a particular choice of course of action . It allows us to process abstract concepts, to deliberate, to pla n ahead, to consider options carefully, to review and revise our work in the light of relevant guidelines or standards or rules of procedure. However , Systems 2 thinking is exhausting and difficult and people tend not to use this form of thinking very muc h. System 2 is described by Kahneman as 'O ur lazy controller'. System 2 decisions are more deliberative , however they are still influenced by heuristic s that impact on system 1. System 2 however also relies on well -articulated reasons and more fully developed evide nce. It uses reasoning based on what people have learned through analysis, evaluation, explanation, and self -correct ion. This is the system which people rely on to think carefully t hrough co mplex, novel, high -stakes, and highly integrative problems. However , for most of the ti me ac cording to Stanovich & West we prefer to operate in System 1 mode. This model ha s been expanded by Kahneman 263 in his popular book 'Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow ', in which he rehearses not only the basic findings i n relation to Prospect Theory ( The importance of relevant advantage) but also how th ese two systems operate , how they influence each other and h ow they can be influenced. Kahneman gives many examples backed by research studies that illustrate how factors such as cognitive ease, social norms, anchoring, availability, emotion, the impact of recent events and framing all impact on decision making. A great deal of other work has been undertak en by behavioural psychologists, brain scientists and biologists in recent years that has expanded our understanding about what influences non-rational behaviour . Major works in this area are those by Ariely 264, Ciladidi 265 Goldstein et al 266 and Brafman and Brafman 267. For example Ciladidi sets out a list of six principles of persuasion that are based on emergent understanding about influences on non- rational cho ice or System One thinking. These are: 1. Liking : We are influenced by people we feel we can relate to. 2. Authority : We are more open to being influenced by a person who can dem onstrate or we perceive to have impressive credentials, experience and knowledge . 3. Scarcity : We all want what is scarce, which explains the effectiveness of limited -time offers . 4. Consistency/Commitment : We like to think of ourselves as being consistent; when we commit to a belief or action we tend to stick with it, so it's a good idea to get peop le to change by starting with a small easy step. 5. Reciprocity : We all like to return favours, if I am offered something I will give something back. 6. Social P roof: We are influenced by our perceptions and observations about what others are doing . 263 Kahneman, D. Thinking fast and slow.

London. 2009 106 Nudging In the 1980 's, Richard Thaler an economist began importing this new theory into economics, writing a regular feature called \"Anomalies\" in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. Much of this work was later captured in his popular book with Cass Sunstein, 'Nudge '.268 Nudge like a number of similar books brings together in an easy to digest way some of the neo libertarian philosophy promoted by Thaler and Sunstei n together with a number of case studies about how redesigning systems using some of the theory of be havio ural economics and social psychology can make it easier for more people to make positive social choices, albeit choices that do not always require them to fully engage with a decision. What are Nudges? Nudg es are a key mechanism fo r an approach to so cial transforma tion called 'liberal paternalism'. A central tenant of this position is that most large behavioural issues faced by society stem from a combination of personal choice, environmental factors, cultural factors and economic factors and that there is now a growing body of evidence from many disciplines that people: 1. Do not always act in an economically logical way e.g. we do not always act in a way designed to maximise our own advantage. 2. People do not often rationally and logicall y analyse behavioural decisions, many decisions are processed by what Thaler and Sunstein call the 'automatic' mental system, in a process that Thaler and Sunstein call 'mindless choosing. ' In addition to the power of mindless choosing Thaler and Sunstein review a number of findings from the field of behavioural psychology and a number of other fields to lay out a set of co ncepts that can help inform people with the responsibility for developing choice situations in social programmes, (Thaler and Sunstein call these people 'C hoice architects ') to guide how choices and prompts to behaviour can be set up. These concepts include: Over confidence The power of loss Representation Framing of offers The power of temptation Anchoring Below each of these and other behavioural economics concepts are briefly described. The hallmark of this kind of 'paternalism ' is a focus not on tackling the determinants of health issues by punishing 'bad' behaviour or by nagging people about what they should do. Rather the focus is on incentivising positive choices and creating the conditions or systems in which people feel able to and want to make constructive choices for their own and their families' benefit, or constructing choices that require litt le of no effort that result in a positive personal and social benefit such as vaccination . 268 Thaler R and Sunstein C. Nudge. Improving decisions about health, wealth and happiness. New Haven & London: Yale University Press. 2008. 107 Thaler and Sunstein describe 'Choice Architecture' as designing systems and services in such a way that the good choice, the healthy choice is the easy and rewardin g choice. This kind of paternalism locates responsibility with individuals but also with providers of public services, NGOS's and private organisations to create the choice architecture that will nudge people in the right direction. Thaler and Sunstein's also make the case and give a number of examples about how nudges can be designed and implemented in such a way that they are cost effective. A key part of the nudge agenda is to find low cost interventions that produce high value returns. Thaler and Suns tein's concept of 'Nudging' people into different behaviours enc ompasses interventions that are: \"Easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not\". Libertarian Paternalism as a dvocated by Sunstein and Thaler (2003)269 seeks a middle ground between a state dominated coercive paternalistic approach to creating social change and a more liberal approach that emphasises free choice and the power of the market as the key driver. They ar gue that nudges are a practice representation of this middle ground. Around the world many governments are setting out new approaches to public service delivery that emphasises the power of civic society to tackle the big social challenges rather than a focusing on just the direct action of what governments and departments of state can deliver. These developments are also being driven in many parts of the world by a reassessment in the wake of the recent economic downturn of developing more cost effective and sustainable forms of social intervention. This approach is placing more emphasis on the need to: 1. Realign many of the current social programmes so that they reflect the contribution of citizens, NGO's the private sector as well as government action in response to social challenges. 2. Develop supportive and encouraging approaches to social change rather than coercive forms of intervention. 3. Develop approaches that maximise both choice and responsibility among citizens. 4. Develop more targeted and segmented interventions aimed at specific groups for example developing special programmes for assisting the very poor. 5. Develop approaches that demonstrate savings and value for money. Nudges can be characterised as : o They are positive i.e. they give positive rewards or only minor penalties . o They are voluntary . o They are avoidable . o They are passive / easy, i.e. require little effort and work on mindless choosing . 269 Sunstein C and Thaler T (2003) Libertarian Paternalism Is Not an Oxymoron . The University of Chicago Law Review The University of Chicago Law Review. Vol 70. Fall 2003. No4. 108 o They are low cost, to both the person targeted and to the government or organisat ion utilizing them (consequently they are highly cost effective) . Nudges by their nature are then still paternalistic . They are top down, they are designed by 'Choice Architects' not by the people themselves, they are directive, they are controlling. In this sense the application of a N udge based approach to public health runs counter to some of the newer public health policy drive s for a more citizen directed, whole society response to issues such as pandemic events270. It is also cl ear that in many circums tances N udging people into better health will not result in population level improvements because in some circumstances evidence will make it clear that there will need to be other forms of intervention. Therefore, Nudges could be seen as a helpful part of the solution but not a magic bullet . Common Nudging tactics and mechanisms include such approaches as, using the power of social norms and our desire to reflect the behaviour of others and by so doing gain approval. Using our fear and aversion to loss to promote change. Using the power of inertia in human behaviour through default systems that require little or no effort intellectually or physically. 271 Useful S ummaries of Key Behavioural Economic T actics Two review documents have been produced which give helpful summaries of key strategies and tactics that can be derived from behavio ural economic thinking. These papers are the New Economics Foundation 272 and the UK government Behavioural Insight teams 'Mindspace' review273. The New Economics Foundation summ ary distils the behavio ural economic approach into seven key principles for policymakers: Seven principles 1. Other People's Behaviour M atters Behaviour of individuals is strongly influenced by other people's behaviours, from friends and family to community groups and classmates. The following are different processes that can influence behaviours: Soc ial learning, people look to others for cues on how to behave in certain situations. People change by aligning their behaviour to that of their role models, rath er than by considering their conduct philosophically, or by reading public education leaflets. Social learning theory can help us understand why some ideas and practices spread expo tentially with virtually no promotional activity on the part of government or institutions, whilst other practices persist stubbornly, despite mass attempts to reduce or eliminate them. Social capital, as discussed in section four . Social Capital consists of the 'networks, norms, relationships, values and informal sanctions that shape the quantity and co - operative quality of a society's social interactions'.274 There is intrinsic value in social 270 WHO Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response.

People are influenced by prevailing opinions in society and their perception of these norms will greatly influence their behaviour. 2. Habits are I mportant When we do something out of habit, we don't use much cognitive effort. Behaviour moves fr om being internally guided through attitudes and intentions to being controlled by environmental cues through habit. For example, individuals don't always act in their own best interest if it is against habit i.e. buying a particular product in the shop be cause you always do, not because it is the cheapest/best. Three features of undesirable (bad) habits make them strong and durable structures: frequency, automaticity (doing the thing without thinking about it) and functionality (a reward is attached to the habit). When people have developed strong habits they are less attentive to information and don't relate attitudes and intentions to the habit. So, although some behaviour change theories (Theory of Planned Behaviour) state that attitudes and intentions p redict behaviour, these links can be weakened by habits. However, good habits can also be established and behaviour change interventions seek to establish new behaviours that are performed frequently and resistant to other influences. 3. People are M otivated to 'do the right thing' Individuals routinely forego narrowly conceived self -interest for the sake of altruistic motives. For example, someone might volunteer for a charity because it makes them feel good to help people, not so they can get paid for it. T his is the notion of altruism and cannot be explained by traditional economic rational man model. When people are motivated to 'do the right thing' they can feel guilt if they fail. It has been found that this guilt can be offset by a punishment (i.e. a fi ne) because this can help clear the conscience. 4. People's Self -Expectations Influence how they B ehave People want their beha viours and attitudes to match. People are motivated to seek consistency between their beliefs, values, and perceptions. Where there is a clash between an individual's actions and values/attitudes, they often resolve the discrepancy by changing the values or attitudes rather than the beha viour. However, if attitudes have been openly expressed, e.g. in a public promise, we are more likely to change the behaviour. This shows the important role of commitments. This principle is supported by cognitive dissonance theory, self -discrepancy theory , theory of planned behaviour and social cognitive theory . 5. People are L oss Averse People will go out of their way to avoid loss but will not go out of their way to gain. So people take larg e risks to avoid loss but are much more reluctant to take even sm all risks to achieve possible gains. People are prepared to put about twice as much effort and resource into retaining what they have as they would into gaining something new. 6. People are Bad at C omputation 110 People are bad at calculating probabilities and have internal bias. Decisions made are impacted by how a problem is presented which is influenced by a number of internal heuristic biases that include: 1. Salience - We overestimate the likelihood of certain things i.e. winning the lottery, a plane crash, something that happened recently. We underestimate things that happen relatively often. 2. Discounting - We underestimate the importance of something that may happen in the distant future. People often choose short term gratification over long term rewards i.e. smoking 3. Framing - If a decision needs to be taken between two issues, we are strongly influenced by how the two outcomes are presented. If one appears to be a loss, we will avoid it. Depends on how issues are framed. 4. Defaults - If carbon offsetting for flying were included in a plane ticket price with an opt out option, few people would opt out. 5. Intuition - We jump to intuitive answers quickly, which can be wrong . 6. Fundamental attribution error - Putting more emphasis on personal characteristics r ather than situational factors when something happens i.e. person crashes a car and people think it is the driver's fault rather than the icy road. 7. Price signals - When offered something for free, we undervalue what it is that we are offered. These biases all show us that people don't always act in their own 'best interest' and aren't always rational when taking decisions. The health belief model suggests ways to influence people's perception of risks so that they believe they are at personal risk of, f or example, contracting an illness. The health belief model also assumes that people will take preventative action for the health and engage in health promoting behaviours if they realise they are at risk. 7. People need to feel involved and effective to m ake change If people feel helpless and out of control they are often incapable of doing anything to change their situation. Control of a situation can bring motivation. For example, too much information/choice can confuse people and make them avoid making any changes/choices at all. Knowledge is necessary for, but not sufficient to produce, most behaviour changes. Change is more likely if the health damaging behaviour is not part of an individual's coping strategy. Perceptions, motivations, skills, and the social environment are also key influences on behaviour. For example, an individual's perception of their vulnerability to a risk and its severity is key to understanding behaviour. Also the more beneficial or rewarding an experience the more likely it is to be repeated. 111 The MINDSPACE R eview The MINDSPACE review states that policy tools such as incentives and information are intended to change behaviour by \"changing minds\" for example incentives and information need to be supplemented by approaches based on \"changing contexts\" - the environment within which people make decisions. The report makes that case that there is potential to bring about significant changes in behaviour at relatively low cost by applying some of the principles of behavioural econo mics to shaping many new social policy interventions. The report states : \"Shaping policy more closely around our inbuilt responses to the world offers a potentially powerful way to improve individual wellbeing and social welfare. With this in mind, we s et out nine of the most robust (non -coercive) influences on our behaviour, captured in a simple mnemonic - MINDSPACE - which can be used as a quick checklist when making policy\" The MINDSPACE mnemonic stands for: Messenger We are heavily influenced by who communicates information . Incentives Our responses to incentives are shaped by predictable mental shortcuts such as strongly avoiding losses . Norms We are strongly influenced by what others do . Defaults We go with the flow of pre -set options . Salience Our attention is drawn to what is novel and seems relevant to us . Priming Our acts are often influenced by sub -conscious cues . Affect Our emotional associations can powerfully shape our actions . Commitments We seek to be consistent with our public promises, and reciprocate acts . Ego We act in ways that make us feel better about ourselves . The MINDSPACE frame work is combined in the report with the DEFRA 275 6E's model of policy influence to produce a framework tool that those responsible f or social programme development can use to asses and consider different forms of social intervention that address both changing mind and changing context issues. 275 Demos / Green Alliance 2003. Carrots, sticks and sermons: influencing public behaviour for environmental goals. A Demos/Green Alliance Report for Defra . 112 The 6 Es framework for applying MINDSPACE In basic terms, MINDSPACE represents the tools for changing behaviour, and the 6 Es constitute the framework within which they can be applied. Bringing them together allows policy -makers to address the over -arching \"so what?\" question in practical ways. The report makes it clear however , that when applying MINDSPACE in practice it should not simply be seen as an alternative to existing methods. The report states: \"Behaviour Change\" is part of policy -making, rather than a novel alternative that can be bolted onto policies. Therefore, civil servants ne ed to better understand the behavioural dimension of their policies and actions\". The fact that these two papers which seek to distil the essence of behavioural economics approach come up with slightly different sets of key principles illustrates the dive rse nature of behavio ural economics and its unfolding interpretation. However , many of the concepts are shared and these concepts such as inertia a nd the path of least resistance e.g. making the easiest rather than the best decision do appe ar to be helpful in developing better understanding of how to encourage people to behave in socially responsible ways. Why Nudging is N ecessary but not Sufficient One of the key strengths of the behavioural economic approach is that it acknowledges and attempts to address the social influences on people's behaviour. However , one of its limitations is that because it is trying to model people's behaviour some of the interpretations of human behaviour are (perhaps) still necessarily simplistic. For example , in NEF's first principle 'other people's behaviour matters', the assumption is that we copy other people's behaviour. While this does make sense for some situations particularly where the behaviour is relatively straightforward (i.e. following rules when driving in another country), it doesn't play out for more complex behaviours or decisions, such as saving for retirement or making the transition from inactivity to employment. 113 One of the key weaknesses at the core of behavio ural economics fro m a technic al perspective is its relationship with economics as a predictive science. It is clear that in real life, people's attitudes and preferences are likely to change in the face of external pressures and over time. However, economic models are not at their mos t effective when predicting behaviour in response to big changes in external factors over time. This means that to produce sensible models and predictions, economists tend to work on the basis that preferences are fixed. Economics has evolved over time to take account of more complex problems, such as insufficient information or that, it takes time for people to learn how to act in the most rational way. Other influences or factors may be more likely to trigger change, for example , beliefs in one's abilitie s to carry out the act. A further weakness of the behavio ural economic approach and also much social psychology is that whilst a large number of observed phenomena about human preferences have been documented there seems to be little research or understand ing about the interaction between the different principles, specifically where they might work against each other or how they can be combined. The risk of not knowing the interplay of the different principles is that policy makers may place more weight/sig nificance on one principle, or alternatively equal weight on all principles which may lead to interventions that are not targeting the key behavioural triggers. This suggests further research is required or that when principles of behavioral economics are applied the relevant effect and contribution of each principle needs to be carefully evaluated. Davies (2007)276 has expressed concern over relying solely on a behavioural economic approach as it appears that it is attempting to incorporate psychological theory into the standard economic model rather than acknowledging that both economic and psychological approaches yield useful but diff erent insights into how to influence behaviour and therefore should be treated as complementary rather than trans -disciplinary. From an ideological perspective Nudging can be criticised for adopting a paternalistic approach rather than an approach that se eks to maximise personal decision making and community empowerment. Nudges are paternalistic in that the people who are selecting and designing interventions are still experts rather than citizens and are seeking to us e their expert understanding of human behaviour to manipulate people all be it in a benign way into a pre -selected behavioural res ponse. A further problem is that often this kind of liberal paternalism is focused not on tackling the determinants of issues such as obesity, or crime, rather, the focus is on incentivising positive individual choices by creating the conditions, social pressure, systems or environment s in which people want to make choices for their own benefit, or have to make little effort to 'choose' a personally and social ly desirable course of action. 'Choice Architecture' is the process of designing systems and services in such a way that the 'good' choice is the easy and rewarding one and it does not take much effort to make. This kind of approach locates responsibility for ac tions with individuals but also with providers of public services, NGOS's and private organisations, to create the choice architecture that will N udge people in the 'right' direction. Nudges are directive, and they are controlling. It is also clear that in many circumstances Nudging people into better health or away will seldom be enough to result in population level improvements because in many situations, evidence and experience make it clear that there is a need for other forms of intervention that addre ss the causes of these problems. Nudges can be seen as a helpful part of the solution but not a magic bullet. This conclusion was also reached by the House of 276 at the GES Behavioural Economics seminar 2010 114 Lords review into behavio ur change in public policy which reported in 2011277. The report which rev iewed how concepts such as behavio ural economics were being used in gover nment and the evidence for thei r effectiveness came to the conclusion that it is important to consider the whole range of possible interventions when policy interventions are designed . The report stated that: \"We place particular emphasis on this conclusion because the evidence we received indicated that the Government's preference for non -regulatory interventions has encouraged officials to exclude consideration of regulatory measur es when thinking about behaviour change. Though there is a lack of applied research on changing behaviour at a population level, there is other available evidence that the Government need to use to better effect. We were therefore disappointed to find that , although we received some examples of evidence -based policies, such as policies on energy -efficient products and smoking cessation services, we were also given many examples of policies that had not taken account of available evidence, including policies on food labelling and alcohol pricing.\" In general the report found that to date there were few strong examples where behavio ural economics had delivered substantial measurable improvements in interventions and that more effort should be put into gathering such evidence. The report concluded: \"We also found that a lot more could, and should, be done to improve the evaluation of interventions. This is not only good practice but would help to build a body of research that could inform effective policies targeting population -level behaviour change\". To an extent this challenge has been taken up and respond ed to by the UK government 's Cabinet Office Behavioural Insight Units firs t annual report which does set evidence for both the impact on behavio ur and financial savings across a range of government policy areas where behavio ural economic principles have been applied . 278 279 277 House of Lords, Science and Technology Select Committee - Behaviour Change'. Authority of the House of Lords, London, 2011. 278 Cabinet Officer Behavioral Insight Unit Annual Update 2010 -11 http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/Behaviour -Change -Insight -Team -Annual -Update_acc.pdf 279 Cabinet Officer -12 http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/Behavioural -Insights -Team -Annual -Update -2011 -12_0.pdf 115 Conclusion Most commentators agree that the citizen centric planning and the creation of value via an exchange sits at the heart of all effective social programmes. Exchanges can be what Bagozzi 280 calls restricted, generalised and complex involving one to one or multiple actors and simple transactions or o nes involving multiple kinds of transactions. A key factor in developing a power ful exchange proposition is the process of ensuring that what is offered is something that is valued by the target audience. This offer can have both tangible and intan gible benefits and according to Vargo and Lusch 281 increasingly it is in the f ield of intangible benefits and resources, together with the value that comes from the co -creation of value, an d relationship building that is a powerful driver for change. Additionally sometimes exchanges are positive i.e. people get a physical, social or psychological reward or benefit, sometimes exchanges can be negative, i.e. people will face a penalty, social disapproval or some other form of negative consequence if they continue to adopt a particular behaviour or fail to comply with a behaviour that is being promoted. A further feature of exchange is that in some choice situations some exchanges are 'passive' i.e. they require little cognitive engagement whilst in other situations some choices involve 'active' cognitive engagement and decision -making. As discussed above the concept of 'Nudging' has recently emerged from the field of behavioural economics and r epresents a form of exchange like many other forms of non - rational (System One ) influence associated with behavio ural economics that requires little cognitive engagement i.e. it is passive and seeks to deliver a positive or only small or avoidable negative consequence if not responded to. Nudging and the application of other principles of behavio ural economics as an approach to policy development and tactical implementation is being actively considered by many governments across Europe. However , rather than adopt a position that positive rewards and mindless choosing are the default preferred intervention mode, those responsible for public h ealth interventions when considering what 'Form' 282 of intervention to apply should rather be driven by customer insight alongside evidence from research about what works. Positive rewards and mindless choosing will not work in all situations and that reflection and judgement is also often needed when making many complex decisions to change283. The crux of the matter is to discern, based on citizen ins ight and evidence, what 'Form' of exchange will work in which situation, with which specific target audience. As will be explored in section eight some social exchanges are positive i.e. the target audience will get a financia l physical, social or psychological reward or benefit, and some are negative, i.e. people will face a penalty if they continue to adopt a socially and individually harmful behaviour. However , even these exchanges are designed to have a net positive social effect, fining individuals for driving too fast reduces the overall impact of road deaths on society as a whole as well as saving individual lives. A key factor is to ensure whatever is offered is based on something that is valued positively or seen as a m eaningful but fair deterrent or cost by the specific target audience. For example, imposing a penalty fine that is set at a rate that the audience does not consider high enough or when they 280 Bagozzi, R.P. (1975), \"Marketing as Exchange\". Journal of Marketing 32 -39. 281 Vargo S.L and Lusch R.F. (2004), Evolving to a New Dominant Logic for Marketing. The Journal of Marketing, Vol. 68 No. 1, pp. 1 -17. 282 The word 'Form' in this context means the extent to which an exc hange is framed as a rewards or punishments to motivate compliance and create social value, or uses cost to the citizen and the extent to which it requires the active cogni tive engagement of citizens in a choice situation or not. 283 Grist, M. (2010) Steer: Mastering our behaviour through instinct, environment and reason RSA. London. available at http://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/313208/RSA -Social -Brain_WEB - 2.pdf (accessed March 14th 2011). 116 believe that there is little chance of being caught, will probably not bring about change, but if the rate is to o high citizens will oppose the use and collection of a fine. In addition , some exchanges are 'Active' and some are 'Passive'. Nudges are ideally passive exchanges. A passive exchange is one where people make a decision to act based on more intuitive responses, such as environmental prompts, or by accepting a default option such as being part of a scheme unless they actively opt out. An active exchange is one where people engage in a rational assessment of the exchange, weighing up the pros and cons of the benefits and costs. This process has the added benefit of developing critical judgement capacity and in so doing can assist in many other life choice situations. The following 'Exchange Matrix ' 284 is a way to represent four 'Forms' of exchange that can be offered. It can be used as a conceptual Proto T ool for analysing what forms of intervention have, are , or could be used across a programme designed to influence behaviour. This section of the pa per has sought to draw out some of the key issues and features associated with the development of behavioural economics thinking and how they might be applied in the field of pandemic preparedness and planning. This section of the paper has demonstrated th at behavioural economics and the concepts that can be derived from it may have important implications for the development of any public health intervention. There are clearly ideological and ethical issues as well as technical issues associated with the application of predictive models that seek to influence behaviour using non -rational and non - conscious decision making that will need to be considered by those responsible for pandemic communication and behaviour change programmes. The three conc eptual Pro to Tools set out below : The Cost Value Matrix, and t he de - CIDEDS Framework , the Intervention Matrix Tool and the Behavioural Economics Principles Assessment Questions Checklist are suggested tools for reviewing and deciding on what mix of interventions drawing on traditional and behavioural economics thinking might constitute intervention programmes in individual countries or across regions of Europe with regard to pandemic events . 284 French J. Why nudging is not enough. Social Marketing Journal. Vol 1 Number 2. Emerald Publishing. 2011 117 Proto T ool 8 Cost value matrix, the de CIDES Framework and the Intervention Matrix tools. The Exchange Matrix Tool The Exchange Matrix is a conceptual device or 'Proto T ool' that can be used to represent four different 'Forms' of social exchange that can be designed to promote change in individuals and groups. The assumption is that whilst 'Nudges' can be effective in promoting some behaviours in some situations they do not represent a full toolbox. As well as 'Nudges ', governments and other orga nisations can also use, Shoves, Hugs and Smacks. Social interventio ns may well use a combination of all four. It should also be noted that the four 'Forms' are not absolutely distinct categories rather they represent more of a continuum of options. The matrix is constructed using two axes, the first: active and passive choosing, and the second: positive and negative rewarding or penalising. The selection of which 'Form' of exchange or combination of them should always be driven by evidence of effectiveness and target audience insight. Whichever combination is selected there will be an on -going need to evaluate the impact they are having in terms of behaviour change and how they are perceived by the intended target audiences if the impact is to be sustained. The Exchange Matrix is ideologically neutral, it depend s on in put from experts and target audiences to define the nature of rewa rds or penalties. These in most countries will be 118 developed through existing lega l and representative systems of public engagement, for example the level of fines that might be applied to pe nalise driving too fast will be informed by due legal and economic considerations. The Matrix indicates the importance of 'Mindful Choosing' as well as 'Mindless Choosing' as being an important option for tackling some behavioural chal lenges and as a mec hanism for many long -term social att itudinal and behavioural change programmes. The Exchange Matrix can be used to map a variety of 'Forms' of intervention , it can also be used as a device to communicate the range of interventions deployed in a project or programme as a model to help review the comprehensiveness of social programmes. Whilst the Exchange Matrix can help to describe the variety of 'Forms' of exchange that can be used as part of public health behavio ural and communication programmes or other kinds of social intervention it is not intended to represent the full range of 'Types' 285 of intervention that can be employed by organisations wishing to bring about social good. The de -CIDEDS Framework Tool A key principle of effective health promotion is to apply tailored evidence and insight informed mix of intervention to bring about the desired behavioural goal. In most cases a single intervention is less likely to be effective than multi -component interventions. For example just 'informing ' someone of something may have some limited effect, but if this is combined with practical support and a chance to critically consider it with guidance (Education) it may well be more effective. A key task then, is to establish the right mix of intervent ions gi ven the available resources and time. The de -CIDEDS framework tool, French and Blair -Stevens (2010) sets out five 'Types' of intervention that can be used to encourage and foster social good. The de -CIDEDS Framework Tool 285 The word 'Type' of intervention is used in this context to mean different approaches that governments and public sector institutions can use to bringing about social change or maintaining social benefits. The five Types of intervention open to these organisations are considered to be: Education, Support services provision, Design interventions, Information provision , and Control systems including the law. 119 Proto T ool 9 The Intervention Matrix Tool If the Exchange Matrix is combined with the de -CIDEDS framework tool it is possible to construct an Intervention Matrix that combines 'Forms' and 'Types' of intervention that is capable of representing the vast majority of possibilities available to governments and public organisations when they are developing social interventions. Those who seek to apply marketing principles to assi st with social issues may be able to use this intervention matrix tool to refl ect on and analyse the range of intervention 'Types ' and 'Forms ' of exchange they might develop to achieve their goals. 120 The matrix also has descriptive utility in that it may be used to describe the range of 'Forms' and 'Types' of intervention that may be necessary in any programme. As stated above those who use a marketing approach can also help inform and shape broader social interventions that may use a combination of 'Forms' and 'Types' of intervention by ensurin g that the 'Form' of exchange and 'Type' of interventions that are selected are based on user understanding and insight Proto Tool 10 Behavioural Economics Principles Assessment Questions Checklist This Proto Tool is a combination of key principles of behavioural economics that planners can use as a check list of potential ways to influence behaviour as part of the tactical execution of programmes drawn from the behavioural economic texts sighted in this section of the paper and previous sections and annexe one . 1. Making it easy How can we make the message easy to understand and the behaviour easy to do? 121 2. Consistency How can we ensure that the first step to change or compliance is a very easy one? 3. Benefit now How can we make the benefit of the action something the audience gets now or very soon? 4. Messenger Is the messenger we have chosen seen as likable and authoritative and can do people relate to them? 5. Incentives and Penalties What can we of fer as a positive incentive and how can we frame losses that will accrue if action is not taken? 6. Habits How can we set up new habit that supports the public health objective? 7. Engagement How can we engage people in the planning delivery and evaluation of the programme? 8. Social Norms Is there a social norm that we can use to influence the behaviour? 9. Salience How can we make our message, advice and support interesting and exiting? 10. Scarcity How can we position the offer as one that is limited and time dependant? 11. Reciprocity What exchange can we offer that will set up an obligation to act? 12. Framing How can we frame the message or ask so that it is appealing and reduces loss? 13. Priming How can we influence the subconscious by using cues such as design, images, sound, colours smells etc? 14. Emotion What emotional appeal will work best with our target audience? 15. Commitment How can we get the audience to make a public commitment to the behavi our we are targeting? 16. Consistency 122 How can we get people to view the action as being consistent with their current views beliefs and / or actions? 17. Simple How can we get rid of difficult calculations and the need for complex risk assessment? 18. People's self-expectations influence how they behave How can we help people with develop the skills they need to act? 19. Risk perception How can we frame the risk so that it is perceived to be relevant, likely and serious enough to warrant action? 20. Ego What can we do to frame the ask so that it makes the audience feel better about themselves? 123 \"Too often, people create an elegant plan around the wrong premise or the wrong goal \"286 Understanding from the Field of Behavioural Programme Planning Introduction As stated in section six and seven when planning health promoting programmes aimed at pandemic events or other public health challenges , theories and models should have a central role in assisting the design and evaluation of the effective pro grammes287 288. However , an equally important factor in the delivery of an intervention is the application of a logical and documented planning approach that is capable of interrogation and able to produce learning about what worked well what did not and what aspects of a programme were efficient in terms of demonstrating a good return on investment and value for money. In short , systematic planning processes are key to understanding not only which elements of a programme were most successful but also which wer e the most efficient. At the moment many health promotion campaign programmes have the following characteristics which ultimately mean that they are difficult to evaluate and suffer from a range of implementation weaknesses : Many behaviour change progr ammes are constructed by experts and policy planners and driven down through public health systems and the media to influence behaviour . This approach which is influenced by political as well as public health considerations is driven by health ministers a nd biomedical \"experts\" and does not always include citizen insight research into the behaviours and b eliefs of the target group. T he result is that often the messages can be misunderstood or viewed as irrelevant by the people they are intended for. This approach results in recipients filtering out messages. Many programmes are short lived and open to constant revision. Timescales are often short -term with little baseline evidence for action and evaluation of the impact. These short -term campaigns are often focused on and evaluated through an assessment of impact on agenda manag ement rather than population behaviour chan ge. Many programmes are not adequately performance or programme managed. Activity is fo cused around developing messages and targeted media buying with the result that vital planning, insight and evaluation stages are neglected. This focus on 286 Bill Novelli.

There is a tendency to repeat public health information to the public in the same format/style instead of developing the message over time so that it changes to meet the expect ations/needs of target groups. The result is that people are bored and the information is largely ignored. Campaigns o ften lack co -ordination and integration between the many policy directives across governmen ts. This can result in public health campaigns that provide contradictory advice which in turn can confuse the target groups. Many public health programme s have significant (sometimes unrealistic) goals and begin w ith a large fa nfare but soon lo se momentum because implementation has not been planned adequately . There are few programmes that utilise a full intervention mix of education, design, support services and control measures and o ften programmes are insufficiently funded t o achieve their stated goals . These common weaknesses are evide nt in many interventions focuse d on pandemic ev ents as outlined in sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this paper. This set of weaknesses is developed further as a Proto T ool checklist at the end of this section of the paper. The Characteristics of Successful Behavioural Intervention P lanning In this section the various factors that are characteristic of many successful not for profit behaviour change programmes are revie wed. They represent the main universal underlying principles of success i.e. irrespective of the disease issue, target group, target behaviour or country context. These characteristics in many ways set out a counterpoint to those weaknesses set out above. Although specific programmes themselves cannot often be replicated, evidence derived from literature and programme evaluation demonstrates that there would appear to be a number of common characteristics that most successful programmes exhibit. Clearly pr ogrammes aimed at influencing human beliefs , attitudes and behaviour are complex in nature. The MRC289 guidance on developing and evaluating complex interventions already reviewed in this paper sets out a number of helpful questions that planners and researc hers should address when seeking to set up such programmes. In the planning and early development stages of a programme these questions include: 289 Medical R esearch Council. De veloping and evaluating Complex interventions,.2010www.mrc.ac.uk/complexinterventionsguidance 125 1. Are you clear about what you are trying to do, what outcome you are aiming for, and how you will bring about change? 2. Does your intervention have a coherent theoretical basis? 3. Have you used this theory systematically to develop the intervention? 4. Can you describe the intervention fully, so that it can be implemented properly for the purposes of your evaluation, and replicated by others? 5. Does the existing evidence, ideally collated in a systematic review , suggest that it is likely to be effective or cost effective? 6. Can it be implemented in a res earch setting, and is it likely to be widely implementable if the results are favourable? The paper gives guidance that if any of these questions cannot be fully answered there is further development work needed before projects are initiated. With regard to piloting and feasibility studies the guidance sets out a further couple of questions that need to be considered: 1. Have you done enough piloting and feasibility work to be confident that the intervention can be delivered as intended? 2. Can you make saf e assumptions abo ut effect sizes and variability and rates of recruitment and retention in the main evaluation study? With regard to evaluation the guidance poses the following questions: 1. What design are you going to use, and why? 2. Is an experimental design preferable and if so, is it feasible? 3. If a conventional parallel group randomised controlled trial is not possible, have you considered alternatives such as cluster randomization or a stepped wedge design? 4. Have you set up proc edures for monitorin g delivery of the intervention and overseeing the conduct of the evaluation? The paper also recommends that including a process evaluation is a good investment to explain discrepancies between expected and observed outcomes, to un derstand how context influences outcomes, and to provide insights to aid implementation. Including an economic evaluation will likewise make the results of the evaluation much more useful for decision -makers. The paper also goes on to make a number of recommen dations with regard to summarising findings and reporting results. NICE 9 has also developed a set of planning guidance for behavioural interventions , recommend ation s that cover much of the same ground as the MRC guida nce, specifically NICE sets out three core actions related to generic planning principles : 126 1. Plan carefully interventions and programmes aimed at changing behaviour, taking into account the local and national context and working in partnership with recipients . Interventions and programm es should be based on a sound knowledge of community needs and should build upon the existing skills and resources within a community. 2. Equip practitioners with the necessary competencies and skills to support behaviour change, using evidence -based tools. (Education providers should ensure courses for practitioners are based on theoretically informed, evidence -based best practice.) 3. Evaluate all behaviour change interventions and programmes, either locally or as part of a larger project. Wherever possibl e, evaluation should include an economic component. It is possible to add to this list of core recommendations a number of further common characteristics associated with effective public health planning. These incl ude: Clarity of P urpose \"A successful programme, no matter how we define it, has got to begin with very clear, realistic, measurable goals,\" says Barbara Beck of the Pew Charitable Trusts. \"Campaign goals that are not explicit and realistic \"290 Behaviour change programmes require a set of clear measurable and sensible behavioural objectives that need to be achieve d in the timescales of the programme. Often many governmental public health p rogrammes have unrealistic, or in the opposite extreme, no objectives. These objectives need to be based on thorough research about what is achievable and realistic . According to Bill Novelli of AARP, picking the wrong goal is one of the most common mistakes that public health organisations often make . A fundamental principle is that public health organisations need to move towards an even sharper focus on measuring outcomes rather than process activity tracking as a principle measure of progress. Clear outcome targets that accurately measure 'health' impact are essential. Many health outcome targets tend to foc us on morbidity, mortality . These types of targets in behavio ural terms can also be augmented by targets focused on the populations reported and observed protective behaviour in accordance with guidance during each of the pandemic phases such as the uptake of vaccines and compliance with good hygiene practice. As stated in the previous section of this paper the development of SMART objectives related to each programme aim can help to sharpen the clarity of purpose of pandemic programmes. 290 Now Hear This, 2001, Fenton Communications 1320 18th Street, NW, Washington DC 20036 202 -822-5200 www.fenton.com . Sponsored by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation 127 Policy Coherence and I ntegration It is vital that behaviour change programmes are planned and i mplemented across institutional, departmental and in the case of pandemic events , international borders. A multi -faceted approach where a number of sections of government and stakeholder partners combine with a joint vision of what they want to achieve has a much higher chance of success than single initiatives developed in silos. It is always critical to ensure policy coherence; there are numerous examples of programmes acros s government which have contradictory aims and objectives. \"It follows from the evidence presented here that there is no single intervention, and no simple remedy, that can reduce the burden of chronic diseases. As we have learned from our experience with tobacco, it requires a prolonged commitment of skills and resources in a multi -setting, multi -factor, multi -strategy approach .\"291 The vast majority of successful behavioural programmes then tend to utilise a combination of strategies across government/NGO's/Stakeholder organisations to achieve change. \"The most successful interventions in reducing smoking rates have involved combinations of policies, including price increases, advertising restrictions, smoking site restrictions, consumer educ ation and smoking cessation therapies .\"292 Another key to success in the development and delivery of public health programmes that aim to influence behaviour is the development of both internal and external coalitions of supporters and stakeholders who share similar goals and aspirations. Working with ex ternal stakeholders can provide u seful insight s into consumer behaviours. For example , the development of the Change for life Obesity Social Marketing Strategy in the UK 293 involved many retail organisations w ho contributed valuable insight into behaviours of key groups of consumers/target groups . Stakeholders can also act as trusted sources who are close to target group s and are perceived to be credible and authoritative message givers. The national Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence endorses the need to work with and through relevant stakeholders when developing and delivering public health campaigns. It is \" vital that any behaviour change programme should be developed in partnership with stakehold er organisations \"294This finding is supported by many government agencies 295 Customers D riving the Intervention Many behavioural change interventions are based on evidence derived from published studies and analysis of epidemiological data. This information is vital but not sufficient to develop effective behavi oural interventions.

We will base our management of those services on an illusion, recording as a triumph each duplicative and unnecessary phone call because it has been dealt with within the target time allowed. The complex social problems of exclusion, many of whi ch can be alleviated by early intervention, will remain intractable .\"297 What these quotes and the discussion in sections three through to six make clear is that without a deep understanding of the target audience the development of an effective campaign , be it aimed at understanding, influencing beliefs or behaviour will stand little chance of success. The Need for Sustained and Outcome F ocused Budgeting When investing in behavioural change programmes there is a threshold point that must be reached in terms of population awareness and action before any return on investment can be measured. In an increasingly competitive environment for attention and engagement , public health programmes are often not funded to a sufficient level that they are able to achieve 'cut through' and recognition to their intended audiences. As indicated at the start of this section insufficient levels of investment are often compounded b y stop start approaches to investment. The amount to be invested to achieve measurable impact on behaviour in target segments is a key factor to be determined in the development phase of any planned programme. A second key consideration is the time frame over which an investment will need to be maintained to achieve the target s of the programme. If funders are not able to commit sufficient funds over the required period they must be made aware that the impact of their more limited investment may be reduced further by a lack of perseverance. Impact over time is a key issue to be addressed when putting together a full business case for i nvesting in behavioural change. A move towards outcome based budgeting can be aided by the adopti on of what has been called the 'Three step process' 298 for budget allocation to behavio ural programmes. This model recommends that r ather than allocating a fixed amount of financial resources to scope, develop, implement and evaluate a programme it is more effective if budgets are 296 Sir Gus O'Donnell, Cabinet Secretary, quoted in Customer insight in public services \"A Primer\" October 2006, p .1 297 Customer insight in public services \"A Primer\" October 2006, p.1 298 French J Commissioning Socia l Marketing.

On completion of a scop ing stage and based on the report that it produces commissioners should then allocate a second budget for development . This phase will work up the proposals , undertake field testing and refine ment or if necessary redesign the proposed interventions so that they meet the requirements of the programmes and are acceptable to the target market and stakeholders . After the development phase , a full business plan can be developed which should form the basis of full funding allocations to scale up and fully implement the recommended interventions and evaluate their impact. If this three step approach to funding is applied by funders and if it is complemented by public health practitioners in the public sector setting out the evidence for their recommendations, e stimates of projected savings and value for money analysis the chances of well ex ecuted behavioural intervention will increase , and it will be possible to build a costed evidence base for public health that will inform future planning and delivery . The nee d to develop a greater focus on the design of efficient as well as effective programmes is not without complexity as a number of economic factors will need to be taken into account when assessing the overall e conomic impact of a programme. \"There are also wider economic benefits to individuals and society, arising from reductions in the effects of passive smoking in non -smokers and savings to the health service and the employer. These wider benefits are often omitted from economic evaluations of cessation interventions, which consequently tend to underestimate the true value for money afforded by such Programmes. \"299 However , a key and common error often made in the public sector is for behavioural change programmes that have achieved success in one particular environment to be transported directly to another without any of the key planning processe s that have been outlined in this and previous section s being put in place. What works in one environment may not be able to be directly replicated in another. \"Studies of tax, price and behavioural change policies applied to tobacco and alcohol products in many countries provide persuasive evidence of their impact on decreasing consumption of those products. These policy interventions may serve as models for similar approaches for lowering consumption of highly saturated fats or other energy -dense foods. However, critical differences among these type s of interventions may limit their generalizability to food consumption \"300 299 Economics of smoking cessation, Steve Parrott and Christine Godfrey, BMJ 2004, p. 947 300 Goodman C, Anise A (2006).

Copenhagen, WHO Re gional Office for Europe (Health Evidence Network report; http://www.euro.who.int/document/e88909.pdf, 130 Syst ematic Planning and D evelopment of Interventions A key weakness as highlighted in the beginning of this section of the paper is that there is in many public health interventions a lack of systematic planning through many of the key stages of behavioural programmes (Scoping, development, launch, implementation , evaluation, dissemination). Many programmes quickly move to creating messages and investing in mass media p rogrammes without sufficient effort put into developing robust plans and testing them. Good planning entails , as noted by NICE and MRC two key considerations: The need to spend time and resources on planning . Planning for the best case and worst -case scen arios. Looking at the issue from every angle. Review of potential solutions. Knowing who your allies and enemies are. The need to think through the total strategy before moving to tactics. As Jon Haber puts it \"The laziest thing pe ople do is go right to tactics . You have to start with what you are trying to get done, who can get it done for you, what you have to tell them , and who has to tell them to persuade them. \"301 These two key factors are well known but the reality is that many communication and behaviour change programmes are not based on well -articulated and recorded planning templates that cover all of the key elements of what is considered to be good planning principles. This lack of systematic planning in many public health communication programmes exists despite the existence of a number of well -designed systematic planning models that have been developed for health promotion and for 'not for profit ' behaviour change interventions. One of the clear challenges is to encourage practitioner s to use these models and for sponsors to insist that some form of systematic planning is used to structure programme delivery and evaluation. Rather alarmingly , one study by Godin et al302 using an instrument based on nineteen planning tasks in the interven tion mapping framework developed by Bartholomew et al303 found that of 123 projects assessed only 15% properly completed an objective setting stage and only 25% completed any form of theory - practice assessment. There is clearly a case as Haglund et al304 suggest for: More user friendly planning instruments for practitioners Quality assessment instruments that reflect the reality of practice More professional training for those responsible for developing and d elivering plans. . 301 Now hear this. 2001.

National Social Marketing Centre. 2006 132 133 Each of these planning models set out a number of key steps that proceed from analysis through development and into implementation and evaluation. Each of the planning models key steps are slightly different but the COMBI model is closer to the CDCYNEGY, T PP model and the STELA social marketing model in approach. Whilst Greens PRECEDE model explicitly starts with the determinants of health analysis it is in terms of its structural components set out in a similar logical sequence of steps that involve probl em analysis through to programme planning , implementation and evaluation. The PREFFI model is a combination model that can be used to structure a plan but also as a quality assessment tool for existing plans. There are also a large number of more prescrib ed planning models that have been developed not specifically for behavio ural change within the public health field but rather focused on related specific issues , such as enabling community empowerment 309 and the role of advocacy programmes310. Many of these planning ap proaches have their origin in , or are closely related to the planning process known as 'L ogical Frameworks' or 'Outcome Logic', 'Programme T heory' which all refer to similar processes (although there may be a difference of emphasis and focus ). Log Frames as they are most often known are an approach to planning that has its roots in military planning but were adapted for social programme design by the USAID programme in 1969 311. According to Hills 312 'Logic Mapping' is popular because it uses a simple visual framework with key headings to describe a logical and staged process under a set of key task areas . This approach is particularly recommended as part of a 'T heory Based' or 'Theory of Change' approach to evaluation, but can also be valuable alongside other evaluation approaches.

Tavistock Institute. London. 2010 134 requires practitioners to identify and describe a number of key elements of their intended intervention. These typically include: 1. The issues being addressed and the context within which the intervention takes place . 2. The inputs - resources and activities - required in order to achieve intervention objectives . 3. Outputs (e.g. in terms of target groups to be engaged, r oads built, products developed) 4. Outcomes (i.e. short and medium -term results, such as changes in traffi c flow levels and mode l shifts) 5. Impacts (i.e. long -term results such as better quality of life, improved healt h, environmental benefits etc.) Components of an Intervention Logic M ap 'Logic Mapping ' is widely used in the planning and design of new interventions . A number of different 'types' of 'Logic M apping ' can be identified in the literature including those with an 'outcome' focus, those with an 'activity' focus and those with a 'theory' focus 313 . 'The Logic Mapping ' process also involves developing consensus amongst stakeholders about interventions, outcomes and impacts. 'Logic Mapping ' places a great deal of emphasis on identifying clear 'Objective Verifiable Indicators (OVI's) and Means Of Verification (MOV) models to ensure that what is expected to happen is tracked and reported on. As with other planning model s 'Log Frames ' can have the danger that they are sometimes rather rigidly applied and so stifle the opportunity to react to changes in circumstances outside the programme plan . In contra st to the 'Log Frame ' approach Social Marketing , which seeks to apply marketing theory and practice to social causes used a systematic but reflexive approach to programme planning. Social Marketing is underpinned by a number of similar planning 313 For a good general guide to Logic Models concepts to the other models mentioned above but it also contains a number of distinctive additional features . Social M arketing is distinct among the models outlined above in that it 's criteria for success rest on measurable behavio ural change. Indicators , such as increased awareness and understandi ng are only used as process tracking mechanisms, observable or reported beha viour change being its 'bottom line' indicator. The Social M arketing approach is based on a num ber of particular if not unique principles that have been expressed in the UK as a se t of government endorsed planning benchmark criteria for social change programmes .314 These planning principles inc lude a focus on: 1: Insight Driven Programme D evelopment Social m arketing is based on the development of a deep 'insight' into people's lives, with a clear focus on what will and will not move, motivate or enable people to change in any given situation. Insight drills down from a wide understanding of the 'custom er orie ntation' to focus on identifying key factors and issues relevant to influencing a particular behaviour. The approach is focused on identifying and developing 'actionable insights' based on all available relevant data to make considered judgments about what will help. T hese insights are subsequently tested through pilots and refined or rejected according to their utility. 2: Exchange and Choice A rchitecture Consists of understanding and developing interventions that make it more likely that people will adop t a particular behaviour. This core concept involves developing one of three approaches or a combination of them: 1. A compelling positive 'exchange' proposition based on customer analysis, is what a person will perceive as a value that outweighs the cost o f change, i.e. an incentive based approach . 2. The development of a system, service or product that assists or 'nudges' a person voluntarily towards a socially beneficial behaviour. 3. The development of a system, service or product that requires a person to beh ave in a particular way or face a negative consequence i.e. a disincentive. 3: Competition analysis and action A robust competition analysis is a key principle of social marketing programmes. Competition analysis examines both internal and external compet ition that restrict or stop the desired behaviour form happening, this then leads to strategies being developed to address these forces. Both internal and external competition analysis is undertaken Internal competition (e.g. psychological factors, plea sure, desire, risk taking, and addict ion) External competition (e.g. wider influences and influencers competing for the audience's attention, time, and behaviour, promoting and reinforcing alternative or counter behaviours) 4: Behavioural G oals Social M arketing has a clear focus for achieving impact on people's behaviour, and is based on the setting out of SMART behavioural goals. A broad behavioural analysis is undertaken to develop a rounded picture of the current behavio ural patterns and trends, making sure to examine both, the 'problem behaviour'; and the 'desired behaviour'. Interventions are then developed to focus on specific behaviours (going beyond just focusing on addressing information, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs). Interventi ons seek to address four key behavioural issues not just the 'behavio ur change': 314 National Social Marketing Centre Social Marketing Benchmark Criteria. French J. Blair -Stevens C. 2007. 136 1 Formulation and establishment of the behaviour \u2014understanding what helps trigger and establish the behaviour in the first place (making sure to look at both the problem an d the desired behaviour) 2 Maintenance and reinforcement of the behaviour \u2014understanding and sustain ing the behaviour over time (again making sure to look at both the problem and the desired behaviour) 3 Behavioural change - understanding what will move an d motivate or assist people to make changes and what barriers need to be addressed . 4 Behavioural controls \u2014understanding where voluntary approaches may not work and where ethical criteria can justify the use of requirements or controls to influence the behaviour in the given context . Social M arketing is also distinguished by its explicit embrace of theory. Theory drawn from many disciplines to inform and steer the development of programmes. Theory is used to inform and guide development, with theoretical assumptions being tested as part of the developmental process. An open integrated theory approach is applied to systematically examine which form of theory offers the greatest utility in a given context, while avoiding the tendency to simply apply the sam e 'preferred' theory to every situation and context. 5: Segmentation Social Marketing applies a segmentation approach, going beyond demographic and where relevant epidemiological and service uptake data by adding data about people s beliefs, attitudes, understanding and behaviours. Target audiences are segmented using this data into sub sets that share common beliefs, attitudes and behaviours. Interventions are directly tailored to specific audience segments rather than relying on 'b lanket' 'spray and pray' approaches. 6: Methods mix Social M arketing examines and uses an appropriate mix of methods to achieve the goals of the progra mme. A range of different types of intervention are examined and used to establish the most effective, efficient an d cost effective mix of methods : Educate, to enable and empower . Support, to serve and practically assist . Design, to alter : environment , systems, products, services . Con trol, to require, regulate and enforce . Inform, to communicate facts and attitudes . Each of these types can be overlaid with intervention forms that focus on delivering positive or negative reinforcement and also focus on either rational cognition or interventions designed to influence rapid cognition or what was described in section seven of this paper as 'mindless choosing'. 137 7: Systematic an d Reflexive Planning Social M arketing interventions are characterised by ext ensive planning and the development of Social M arketing plans. There are a variety of different planning models but the y all tend to include a focus on what is often called , scoping. Scoping involves bringing together behavioural theory, evidence of what h as worked to influence behaviour and insight about what will influence target audiences. Social Marketing planning models all include a pre - testing and development phase to prototype interventions before full scale delive ry. Social Marketing implementation planning is reflexive e.g. it is designed to track the efficiency and effectiveness as programmes are delivered and allow for refinement as projects proceed. All planning mod els also include strong element s of evaluation, quality assurance and feedback of learning to further improve subsequent programmes. The E vidence for Social Marketing There is a growing body of evidence that indicates that Social M arketing can be an effective approach to behaviour change in the health sector . 315 316 For example , the r ecent CDC review of S ocial Marketing , 317 the CDC Task F orce findings and recommendations which derive from the comprehensive review methodology of the CDC Community Guide programme identified what they term \"strong evidence of effectiveness for producing intended behavio ur changes. The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommended that health communication campaigns that use multiple channels, one of which must be mass media, combined with the distribution of free or reduced -price health - related pro ducts showed that programmes: Facilitate adoption and/or maintenance of health -promoting behaviours (i.e., increased physical activity through pedometer distribution combined with walking campaigns). Facilitate and/or help to sustain cessat ion of harmful behaviours (i.e. smoking cessation through free or reduced cost over -the-counter nicotine replacement therapy [OTC NRT]). Protect against behavio ur-related disease or injury (i.e. condoms, child safety seats, recreational safety helmets, sun -protection pro ducts). The review also noted: 'Because results were positive across all the health behaviours evaluated, these findings are likely to apply to a broader range of health -related programmes . The systematic review focused , however , only on interventions that included a mass media component; therefore t he results may or may not apply to campaigns that do not include a mass media component. There is a growing evidence base that Social M arketing focused on the prevention and control of communicable disease ,318 further endorsement for adopting a Social M arketing approach to planning and delivery of effective behavio ural programmes in the health sector comes from the new WHO Europe Health Strategy 319 which endorses the use of Social Marketing as part of the recommended approach to health policy.

The evidence indicates that audience -informed intervention design and development, partnership -based interventions, and sharing of lessons learnt from previous practice can enhance effectiveness of social marketing for communicable disease prevention and control' Understanding f rom Generic Health S ector Planning In addition to understanding fro m healt h promotion and health focused Social M arketing there is also a great deal of evi dence re - effective planning and implementation management for the health sector itself as many health service systems clearly include behavioural components such as attendance at clinics and compliance with recommended me dications or specific behaviours such as rehabilitation focused exercise. Perhaps the most comprehensive analysis of successful health service criteria has been undertaken by Klassen et al in 2010321. This review analysed thousands of papers and nearly 600 f ull text papers involved in a review of core quality criteria for successful delivery of health services. The authors highlight five key themes for performance measurement and improving service delivery: Collaboration . Learning and innovation . Management . Service provision excellence . Outcome focus . These themes and find ings fro m Kla ssen et al echo the findings fro m previous research but offer additional insight into the complexity of establishing criteria or guidelines for the development , delivery and evaluation of health interventions , including pandemic management and preparation. The wide scope of factors feeding into each theme demonstrates that numerous variables are involved; this clearly has implications for the need to be guided by such criteria but also the need to exercise judgement depending on the particular circumstance of individual countries and regions. A further consideration that builds on the issue of collaboration highlighted by Klassen et al is the issue of integration and co -ordination of service delivery. Suter et al322 set out in 2009 a set of key principles based on a comprehensive systematic review of health literature focused on key principles for improving integration and co -ordination of service deliver y. Suter et al highlight the importance of patient focus, maximising access and exposure to services, the need for standardised quality assurance and performance managed delivery backed by accurate information systems. They also indicated that strong marke rs of success include a strong organisational culture of leadership and sound financial planning. The work of Suter is helpful when looking at performance management as the authors focus is on quality issues and ensuring that outcomes are clearly defined a nd measured appropri ately. Information from outcome measures can then be used to improve service 320 320 MacDonald L, Cairns G, Angus K, Stead M.

This kind of virtuous circle of improved performance is a key learning point for improving systems approaches to pandemic management. One clear implication is the maintenance of on -going review mechanisms of performance at local , national , regional and global level. A final issue to cons ider with regard to learning fro m generic health systems planning, management and performance that can be applied to communication and marketing planning with direct significance for pandemic event preparation and management is the issue of prioritisation of effort. Priority setting is clearly a key issue in managing any infectious disease public health scenario. To understand how health service managers establish priorities Gibson, Martin and Singer 323 interviewed health service decision makers to determine their priorities and how these were applied. The key criteria identified are set out in the follow ing table: Table: Key P rinciples for Service Success I. Strategic fit a. Clinical services contribute to advancing the strategic directions of the organization . b. Key driver in operational planning . II. Alignment with external directives a. Government directives/policy . b. Regional versus national initiatives . III. Academic/Education C ommitments a. Integrating education of future healthcare professionals with health service delivery . b. Research to further best practice standards . c. Innovation . IV. Clinical Impact. a. Service volume necessary to ensure clinical competence of medical staff to provide safe and effective care . b. Quality of service . c. Uniqueness of health service for local area . V. Community N eeds a. Regional and local patient needs . b. Service demand (utilization rates, waiting times ). VI. Partnerships (E xternal ) a. Co -ordinating care delivery with external partners . b. Enhance service quality and resource utilisation . VII. Interdependency (I nternal) a. Co -ordination and collaboration across clinical services .. b. Enhance service equality . 323 Gibson L Martin S Siger D (2004) Setting priorities in health care organisations. Criteria processes and parameters. BMC Health Service Research. 4 25 -33. 140 c. Quality of work life factors are key enablers . VIII. Resource Implications a. Mobilisation and use of human and fiscal resources. The criteria identified in the table above clearly have a great de al in common with the criteria and key features identified by Klassen and Suter and the Social M arketing planning models outlined above. It would appear then that the core principles of successful planning applied by health systems and services managers an d service providers are reasonably consistent and are closely matched with what most organisations would consider to be principles of sound planning and management. In terms of developing successful behavio ural influence programmes it is clear that these characteristics are also important and the more that are present the gr eater the probability of success. Conclusions In summary the literature concerned with service and behavioural change planning and management provides a reasonably tight consensus on the importance of the application of core sets of planning principles. They set out clear aims and objectives , a development phase that includes gathering theory and data about the problem, clear identification and understanding of targe t audiences, piloting, pretesting and programme refinement and robust management monitoring and evaluation of programme implementation . However , the existence of planning templates is not sufficient to ensure the delivery of effective and efficient program mes. Other factors such as the need for appropriate leadership, well trained and supported staff and systems for learning and review are also important. Taken together with the planning elements set out above these principles can be used to create a plann ing and performance culture which can lead to more efficient and effective behavioural programme performance and ultimately better outcomes in terms of outbreak management and service provision to the public and specific patients. However , public health p rogrammes especially those associated with pandemic events are complex and often fast moving. In many less dynamic health and disease topics, the intervention and the expected outcomes of the intervention can be specifically stated and the processes that w ill be tested for efficiency and effectiveness can be closely defined before implementation. Trials can be conducted in a controlled way that can give reasonably high levels of assurance that there is a causal link between intervention and population behav iour change and or impact on the targeted disease. In such interventions intend ed markers of success can be outlined in a set of clear , measurable , numerical indicators. However , for obvious reasons when dealing with dynamic human populations where all p ossible variables cannot be controlled and when the nature of the behaviour that is being suggested may change rapidly such an idea s approach is not at all easy to deliver methodologically. There are valid arguments that preventive and health promotion in terventions should be as concerned with having an impact on the social determinants of health and disease as much as seeking to influence individual behaviour change. Adopting this more holistic approach 141 means it is clearly more difficult to identify all t he independent variables324. Green warns that if there is not an adequate understanding of a problem, then health promoters may identify the wrong independent variables or address only a proportion of them, meaning that intervention programmes will be less l ikely to achieve their overall aims325. What this means for programme planning in relation to behavio ural influence associated with pandemic events is that in addition to the application , in a systematic way, as of many of the good planning principles set out in this section of the paper practitioners and planner also need to develop plans for a variety of scenarios and also develop p lans that focus on both assisting with outbreak management but also programmes targeted at building community resilience during times of low threat. It is also clear that despite there being a number of logical well -constructed planning models for behaviour change within t he public health fiel d there is a need to encourage a more comprehensive application of these models in pra ctice. This is necessary for reasons of both better delivery but also because it will help to improve the capture and dissemination of what works and what does not and what intervention approaches are more efficient than others. There also appears to be a need for more training in the use of these planning models and the need to develop simpler more user friendly starter models that may encourage adopt ion. The Proto Tools developed in this and other E -Com work streams will aid this process and the dissemina tion of these tools in the final stage of this project will also , hopefully make a contribution to this current problem. The following two Proto T ools can be used to assess the potential weaknesses and strengths of behavio ural influence programme plans: 324 Koelen M, Vaandrager L, Colomer C.

The following check list can be used to assess the existence of common weaknesses in planed programmes designed to influence behaviour in relation to pandemic events. If the programme exhibits one or more of the elements set out below remedial action will need to be put in place to lessen or remove the impact of the weakness . Characteristic Indicate if and how the characteristic is present in the current plans Set out possible mediating actions Programm e constructed by experts and policy planners only. The programmes aims and objectives are non -specific . Citizen insight research has not been used to define target groups and approach . The programme has not made use of theory, evidence and or data to inform its planning . The programme has not developed a strong business case for the allocated or proposed budget . A weak or incomplete situational analysis has been completed of influencing factors . The programme does not have a sufficient time scale to achieve its objectives . 143 The programme is a short - term campaign and will not be evaluated in terms if target audience behaviour change. The programme does not have a clear and robust performance management system. Little or no evidence of plans and resources to ensure widespread stakeholder engagement can be delivered and maintained. A review mechanism is not in place to ensure that the programme messages and approac h are refreshed on a regular basis. The programme has weak mechanisms to co -ordinate efforts within the or iginating country and with relevant organisations at a European level. The programme cannot demonstrate that it has human resource systems in place that will ensure that programme staff are trained and supported to deliver the programme. The programme uses a limited intervention mix of approaches Ethical issues have not been addressed and clearances, approval obtained . 144 Proto T ool 12 Checklist for Assessing t he S trength of Planning for a Behavioural Intervention CHARACTERISTIC YES NO UNSURE COMMENTS 1. CAMPAIGN GOALS/OUTCOMES: Specific, actionable, and measurable behavioural goals have been set that use a SMART format . 2. CAMPAIGN RATIONALE: Presence of a clear rationale and need for the campaign and why particular interventions have been selected. 3. SITUATIONAL ANA LYSIS : Systematic scoping has been done to analyse environment, social, technological, economic and legal perspective. All relevant data, evidence and experience of the issue has been gathered to inform planning . 4. FORMATIVE AUDIENCE RESEARCH: Evidence of primary or secondary formative research, including, audience knowledge, attitudes, practices, an d behaviours in relation to topic area. 5. BEHAVIOURAL THEORY: Behaviour change model/s and theory has been used to segment/target the audience and inform the intervention. 6. STRATEGIC PLANNING: The intervention h as clear written systematic, short, medium and long -term plans that are endorsed by stakeholders programme staff and target audiences . 7. BUDGET: The recommended budget is based on a full business case and is adequate to achieve the objectives of the intervention over the required time frame. 8. PRE-TEST/MONITORING RESEARCH: Intervention has been developed pretested and monitored with the target audience and stakeholder involvement. 145 9. EXCHANGE and VALUE: Analysis has been completed of what audiences value and what the target audience has to give up (e.g., financial, physical, time -related costs) to get the benefits or value proposed , and this is built into the intervention approach . (E.g. Incentives, reco gnition, reward, and/or disincentives are built in) Consideration of the use of products, services and messages that deliver value has been completed . 10. COMPETITION & BARRIERS TO CHA NGE: Factors competing with the desired behaviour are considered and addressed (e.g., environment, economic factors, psychological, media/consumer -related factors , physiological factors such as addiction, etc.). 11. INTERVENTION MIX: An integrated approach is evidenced by the presence of a valued 'prop osition' product or service to the target audience that is offered and promoted through a co -ordinated approach to information, education, service design and execution, and supported by systems and policy. Interv entions may involve both active and passive decision making. 12. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MANAG EMENT : Presence of mechanisms for on -going stakeholder relationship development is evident - including internal/external stakeholders, partners, sponsors, al lied organizations interest group s, communication and management. 13. ETHICS: The ethical implications of the plan are clear, and the program me is designed in such a way to address relevant issues. All necessary and appropriate ethical approvals have been obtained . 14.

SKILLED & SUPPORTED STAFF : The Programme is staffed by experienced people wh o have high level commissioning , planning management and evaluation skills . There are staff review and development systems in place. Programme leadership is robust and well regarded. 146 Conclusions This paper has reviewed a great deal of material related to behaviour change and communication and how this can be applied by public health agencies and governments attempting to prepare for and manage pandemic events. Those responsible for guiding and d elivering marketing and communications activities as part of pandemic events are well aware that many programmes are not as well developed as they could be and regularly seek to improve practice. Current programmes are often focused on individual campaign -specific activity , rather than sustained marketing activity as an integral part of a long -term public health policy process. Often those responsible for delivering commu nications and marketing programmes are constrained by the financial and structural barriers and practices they are forced to employ. The final section sets out a number of key messages or conclusions and some recommendations for improving practice in rela tion to behavioural influencing programmes based on the material reviewed for this report about how public health agencies and governments could work to be more effective in their p ublic health marketing and commu nication functions. These recommendations t ake account of the broad diversity across Europe, the barriers many agencies face and how we can do things differently. We are aware that some of the issues we have identified in this review echo what many agencies and governments have already discovere d during their own reviews of communications and marketing capability, capacity and management. A Time of C hange The current economic situation across Europe is a potential key driver for some radical thinking and reassessment of what represents good value for money in pandemic preparedness . In tough economic times there is a need for more economic evaluation of public health interventions alongside effectiveness and efficiency evaluation s. There are other factors that represent significant drivers fo r a reassessment of current investment that include a greater understanding of the role and limitations of communication strategies in pandemic events and a growing body of understanding about new way s to influence attitudes and behaviour. These challenges are arising because many current recommended approaches such as policy interventions based on communicating risk are not only not universally and effectively delivered but also because that while such forms of intervention may be a useful part of an overa ll approach there may well be the need for them to be augmented by some of the emerging new thinking around behavior and how it can be influen ced coming f rom economics s ocial psychology and other related fields of study. There may well be a need to develop a new narrative that reflects both current evidence about effective practice but one that also incorporates new evidence, emerging new ideas and the current and likely future environment in which these programmes including the new digital information envi ronment. This paper makes it clear that there is not a single or simple approach to influencing behaviour that can be applied across all th ose behaviours that practitioners and policy makers may wish to influence prior to , during and in the aftermath o f a pandemic event. This paper has also demonstrated the obvious point that behaviours and what influences them are complex. As a consequence developing a detailed understanding from a theoretical perspective which then leads to the development of a partic ular behav ioural intervention approach which then leads to the development of a systematic and staged plan detailing all aspects of an intervention and how it will be evaluated is a complex and time -consuming exercise . This complexity results in many pract itioners, public health organisations and 147 agencies fail ing to complete all of these key steps. A further consequence of this sub -optimal planning is that there are not many examples of thoroughly developed plans or many high quality intervention programmes that have been publ ished. The consequential weak evidence base this produces leads to a continuation of sub -optimal intervention delivery. Where more comprehensive behavio ural change plans and even communication plans are developed there focus is often limited to particular pandemic behaviours or awareness issues with little synergy being generated between other related public health policy areas such as poverty and inequality and little recognition of the benefits to be realized in cross - sector approac hes e.g. joining up the health, environment and spatial determinants agenda (such as in the model of social determinants developed by Barton & Grant, 2006326). As seen in section four there is a lack of evidence or only limited positive evaluation for some single approach social advertising, education and information based interventions . However , such interventions still form a key part , if not the dominant part of many government strategies. It is probable and desirable that information transmission interv entions will form part of all policy responses because governments rightly feel they have a duty to inform and educate citizens . The contribution that these forms of intervention deliver should be recognis ed, but positioned as part of an i ntegrated and co mprehensive approach. As seen in section four, evidence indicates that programmes that use multiple elements tend to be more effective than those that depend on information transmission alone. The Core F indings of This P aper The complex behavio ur challenges associated with pandemic events highlight the limits of conventional communication approaches . Well researched , well planned and targeted communications programmes are a vital part of all pandemic management and control intervention programme s. However , the tendency to rely on simplistic information transmission and processing models of influence can reduce the impact of these programmes. Some of the new social policy and heath tools that behavioural scientists and others working in the field of behaviour influence have developed based on a growing body of behavioural research summarised in books such as; Thinking Fast and Thinking slow327, Nudge328 and Influence329 have generated a lot of interest amongst ma ny policy ma kers and planners in government health sector organisations. This new work confirms and makes accessible the understanding that a much wider range of human motiv ations exist that just rational self-interest based on logical information processing. This new understanding makes clear the need for strategies of influence that go beyond the transmission of factually accurate logical information as the main way to influence behavio ur and opinion prior to, during and after pandemic events. Multiple interventions are more successful . The effectiveness of single interventions in isolation does not appear to be as great as combining ones that impact on conscious decision making and decisions that are influenced by other mental processes and external factors such as social norms and inc entives. Economic instruments can provide the stimulus 326 Barton, H. and Gran t, M. (2006) A health map for the local human habitat.

(See separate report under Work Programme 3 focused on incentives) Humans are not entirely rational when making health choices and this understanding needs to be reflected in pandemic programmes . We do not simply decide on the basis of well-presented information to act in way that demonstrates that they have carefully considered the costs and benefits of an action and then selected the option that results in maximum personal or family benefit. Instead, there are numerous internal and external influences on an individual's behaviour that need to be considered and influenced. If we are to influence health behaviour we need t o apply a more sophisticated approach to understanding and developing more comprehensive strategies to influence behaviour that include , but go beyond the transmission of scie ntifically accurate information to include influencing strategies that target non rational choice. T here are clearly considerable ethical issues associated with such approaches that wil l need to be considered. Behavio ural models and theory can help strengthen the development delivery and evaluation of pandemic communication and behav ioural programmes. One of the tentative conclusions that can be drawn f rom this review is that theories intended to modify individual level behaviours remain the most commonly applied in pandemic events. Policy and training interventions could be developed to broaden this focus to include ecological theory and models to guide re search, intervention design and evaluation. When constructing behavioural interventions the use of several theories and models appears to assist with identifying the key elements which are of most use in either explaining the behaviour or predicting what w ill influence change. This understanding can be used as the foundation around which communications and messaging can be designed , and other forms and types of influence developed . This is the approach Darnton recommends to policymakers 330. There will be occasions however, when existing behavioural theory is not a vailable or appropriate. In these circumstances it will be necessary to use existing theory and models to build a behaviour al framework from scratch to inform programm e planning design and evaluatio n. It is not sufficient to consider an individual's voluntary behaviour change in isolation. The impact of social, economic and environmental factors have a large influence on people's ability to behave in certain ways and their motivation to do so. The behaviour of others and the general cultural and social environment s expressed though notions of social capital and community resilience also needs to be considered and often targeted if individuals are to be helped to sustain a positive behavio ur or modi fy a less health y behaviour. The role of communication and other forms of behavio ural influence such as nudging outlined in this paper focus mainly on changing 'voluntary' behaviour, rather than enforcing behaviour change. However , government s supported by public health institutions in some pandemic situations will need to use tools to 'enforce' rather than encourage behaviour change. It needs to be recognised that when the health threat is great governments may need to use different tools to influence peo ple to become compliant including incentives and or sanction s. The use of such tools will also need to be accompanied by communication and behaviour change programmes that seek to engage, explain and involve people in the execution of such non -voluntary ch ange interventions such as fines or restrictions of movement or assembly. 330 Darnton 2008 op.cit. 149 Recommendations Citizen331 Focused S olutions . If the outcome of pandemic communication and behavio ural influencing strategies is to achieve a positive, accurat e and trusted understanding and experience of government policies related to pandemic management and compliance with recommended actions the approach must be to move away from a top down one way communication dominated model. We need to move towards a mo del that is based on customer needs, dialog ue and feedback with people we seek to influence and an approach that is responsive to demands and changing circumstances. We also need an approach that is focused more on impact and outcome measurement in terms o f actual behavio ur. This approach will require a level of sophistication in planning and delivery that goes beyond the traditional 'press handling and a paid publicity' approach. A new approac h that is more strategic, joined -up and customer centric and customer sensitive wil l be required . Given current political imperatives associate d with more active citizen engagement there is a good case for a more citizen focused approach to developing policy guidance related to pandemic events. Most citizens do not c ompartmentalize their reactions or behaviour to infectious disease threats in the way that public health programmes often do. A citizen -focused approach would mean talking about health behaviour and tackling issues in a more citizen centric rather than exp ert or disease centric way. For example, combining work on hand washing as a part of personal hygiene and grooming rather than something related to pandemic events. Such an approach would result in building intervention strategies around a deep understan ding of people's existing attitudes and beliefs rather than single behaviours or discreet clu sters of behaviours related to risk factors associated with pandemic events as specified by experts Public Permission M atters . The concept of Public Permission as defined by the UK Government MINDSPACE 332 review is based on earlier work of Gummesson and Gronroos 333 334 335 on relationship marketing. This European developed view of marketing has had a direct influence on the developmen t of social marketing. Relationship marketing moves away from an influencing strategy focused on external persuasion towards a strategy based on a relationship of mutual respect and dialogue. This concept has been further developed by Godin 336 as 'Permissi on Marketing', which is about seeking people's permission to engage with them, make offers and suggestions of help for them or offers of products or services they may be interested in. When what is known about non -cognitive decision making is combined with this relations hip development approach as stated above , many ethical issues are raised about subtle influence that may not be recognised by citizens. The more powerful and subtle behavioural change approaches are, the more they may provoke public and poli tical concern. Behavioural approaches that embody a line of thinking that moves from the idea of an autonomous individual making rational decisions to a decision -maker, much of whose behaviour is automatic and influenced by their choice environment , raises the question of 331 We use the term 'citizen' to indicate members of the public, the exact word to be used will need to be considered in the light of debate resolution in relation to the issues raised in section two of this paper. 332 Dolan P, Hallsworth M, Halpern D, Kind D, Vlaev I.

One of the key challenges that will face public heal th planners who seek to use no -rational approach es and approaches that seek to build relationship influence is how the permis sion to use these approaches will be given and legitimised in order that a backlash of public opinio n does not result in accusations of trickery and manipulation. The advances in understanding and methodological development in the field of systematic hea lth programme s and behaviour change planning need to be better integrated into pandemic communication and behavioural influence programme management . As discussed in previous sections of this paper the developme nt of more systematic approach to health behaviour change 337 and a growing body of research338 that goes beyond c ommunication theory 339 has been developing over recent years340 341. Intervention forms such as social marketing342, co-creation343 and community engagement344 are examples of these new f orms of social policy delivery. This development along with more general improvement in social policy implementation345 planning346 has resulted in a growing consensus about how to go about establishing , delivering and ev aluating more successful behavioural pr ogrammes in the social sector. This understanding should be used to shape intervention programmes . There is a need to ensure that policy makers and politicians are aware of what us currently known about influencing behaviou r and how to design and deliver an effective intervention. Evidence driven but not evidence restricted . It is probable that governments and public health agencies will always use some forms and types of intervention that are not fully supported by strong evidence. Interventions such as social advertising should not be dismissed as ineffective , rather gover nment and public health organisations should ensure that they apply best practice when developing these forms of intervention . A culture of systematic planning and evaluation should be encouraged to enable transparent report ing on the impact and efficienc y of all programmes. This will help with develop ing the evidence base347 for communication and behaviour change interventions in the field of pandemic management . The use of pilot testing should also feature in all programmes. Cultural and organisational issues, the status of communication and marketing . Behavioural influence and communications often exists as a bolted on adjunct (a ll be it a vital one) to the influence of medical and epidemiological understanding in the policy development and strategy de velopment process.

T his often leads to a producer -led selling approach, i.e. a focus on broadcasting evidence based messages about risk reduction and communication focused on compliance with medical opinion. A significant cultural and technical shift is required within gove rnments and specialist responsible agencies to a more customer -led marketing approach, and a fully integrated partnership between marketing and communications professionals and policy and delivery professionals. The implications of adopting such an approac h would include: Ensure marketing is brought in to policy development as early as possible. It should act as the voice of the citizen when the policy and programme are being developed. Embed a neutral stance regarding how to influence people among all participants including policy officials and ministers during the initial planning stage. Too often there is a leap to a solution, usually involving advertising, without consideration of all the other options or combinations of types and forms of interventi on to achieve the objective. Marketing and communications staff should be positioned to act as the voice of the consumer when the policy and programme are being developed via a responsibility to gather and interpret citizen data on attitudes, beliefs and behaviours. Capacity and Capability . Marketing practitioners in many governments across Europe have excellent technical skills, but there are many countries where this capacity is not so well developed. There is a need to continue to build and sustain a high-level of professional capacity and the marketing and communication professional community will need to have the skill -set that will enable them to engage in policy development as well as programme delivery and evaluation if marketing and communication s is to be more strategically engaged in pandemic pr eparedness policy formulation . The implications of adopting such an approach could include countries undertaking a marketing and communications capacity and skills audit and the development of an assistan ce programme to develop training courses and mechanisms for sharing of best practice and skills and other competences for example , influencing policy makers, stakeholder management and leadership skills. Budgets and other assets . All EU countries hold and deploy their own resources alongside neighbouring countries and also the efforts of international regional organisations such as ECDC, CDC, WHO. Annual budget allocations can fuel short -termism. Budgets are also often allocated as a single entity rather than being divided between development, piloting, execution and evaluation. Ideally budgets should be allocated to cover the complete timescale for the planned activity and should be justified not only in terms of achieving quantifi ed objectives and in terms of programme delivery, but also how the activity will contribute to the overall strategy as a whole. The possibility of cross boarder alignment of marketing and communication resources should be investigated to ensure that budget management is optimal . 152 Silo research and evaluation . There are no current reliable estimates for how much is spent on marketing and communications research in the field of pandemic preparedness and management across Europe . However , it is reasonable to conclude given the size and importance of the issue to governments that the aggregate figure is significant. Most of this research is commissioned for individual agency programmes rather than for the European common good. The implicat ions of adopting such an approach would include: Closer liaison and co -ordination with medical, epidemiological, social and marketing and communications research to inform both policy development and communication planning and evaluation. Initiate more c entrally/ joint -funded marketing and communications research projects to minimise overlaps and maximise strategic joined up opportunities. ECDC and WHO are obvious agencies to take on this role. Use 'upstream' horizon scanning and developmental research t o pro -actively set the strategic marketing and communications agenda across European coun tries and specialist agencies. Develop standardised procedures for evaluative research to demonstrate the effect of pandemic marketing and communications programmes with the public but also inter and internal organisational communications programmes. This research should develop protocols for process measures of campaign efficiency, impact evaluation i.e. short term change such as awareness, as well outcome measures such as behaviour change or com pliance. Proto T ools The final two Proto Tools set out in this section of the paper are aimed at senior responsible officers and Politi cian's. Proto T ool 13 is intended to be used as a set of guidance questions based on a set of good practice principles that can be used to interrogate plans that are proposed by communication marketing and public health officials regarding behavio ur change programmes. Proto T ool 14 draws on what is known about the importance of engaging communities and stakeholders as well as the need in programme planning terms to develop stake holder management planning. Proto Tool 14 is a check list that can be used to ensure that relevant stakeholders, partners and target communities have been engaged in the development of interventions and will be engaged in delivery and evaluation in an appropriate way. 153 Proto T ool 13 Senior Respo nsible Officer Review Checklist 1. Behaviour change programmes need long -term strategic planning. You should seek to ascertain if the proposed programme includes : Plans and stra tegies to integrate and align policy, strategy, delivery . Communications, setting objectives aga inst which to evaluate success. Selecting an a ppropriate mix of interventions. Longer -term and robust budget allocation process. Principles of good impact assessment, such as setting clear objectives, considering a range of outcomes and estimating the likely costs and benefits. 2. You should be provided with evidence of understanding and insight into the factors that will motivate different segments of the target population to change their behaviour or sustain a positive behaviour through the proposed programme. Generating insight into the motivations, influencers, understanding, attitudes and behaviours of target audiences is a key to success. Segmentation of an audience recognises the diverse needs of different groups and allows for targeting of interventions based on what differ ent people really need and want. Segmenting on the basis of not just geography, demographics and socio -economic factors but also attitudes, lifestyle and life stages, understanding, beliefs, values and behaviour will inform a more effective targeting for the behaviour change programmes . Officials should be able to provide you with information about which theories and models of behaviour have been used to shape t he proposed interventions. Offici als should also be able to demonstrate that they have carried out a thorough situational analysis that considers social, political, economic , technological and legal issues and a strengths and weaknesses assessment of current and proposed plans. 3. Have you been assured that all existing evidence and insight relevant to the behaviour change and target audience across government has been brought together before you authorise any new research to be conducted ? Identify opportunities for joint interventions to target the same audiences. Make sure insight informs the beh aviour change programme from planning through to evaluation. Ensure that any new data that is captured is shared as widely as possible with relevant stakeholders and partners. 4. Working together and reducing duplication of effort . Value for money can be improved by greater joint working between departments and other national regional, Eu ropean and International and local public health bodies. Ask for details of joint working, stakeholder management plans and plans to form and manage coalitions to tackle the threat (See Proto Tool 14). Greater leverage can also be gained by identifying partners in the private and voluntary sectors to support behaviour change interventions. (For exam ple, the Department of Health Fl u vaccination team has formed partnerships with the British Lung Foundation and 154 various other voluntary organisations to us e their expertise i n targeting 'at risk' groups). 5. Are you clear that the evaluation model proposed is robust and appropriate? Behaviour change programmes are best evaluated against a range of measures from longer term shifts in eventual outcomes and observed behaviour and short to medium term indicators of progress on programme objectives . Public health bodies need to employ appropriate methods to evaluate success in the long term such as econometric modelling, observation studies , epidemiology and reported behaviour. The mix of evaluation tools depends on the type of behaviour, relative costs and the availability of data. Additionally, short to medium term milestones sho uld have been identified and the means for capturing and reporting on the data established. 6. Have you r equired that the evaluation will monitor actual behaviour change and the resulting health outcomes? Progress against short and medium term milestones suc h as levels of claimed behaviour, attitudes, and awareness should also be measured. These milestones should be based on an understanding of what drives the behaviour of the target audience. Is there commitment and plans to make evaluation results publicl y available and ensure they are fed back into planning and development? 7. Is the budget adequate and proportionate? Many behaviour change programmes will require budgets allocated on a longer -term basis - at least 3 years to allow for research , piloting and delivery. In the case of pandemic events there may be a need to substantially increase budget s. a. Are there contingency plans in place and has scenario planning been completed that allow s for different levels of budget to be allocated? b. Is there a proposed us e of economic analysis to measure the impact of the programme in terms of VFM ( Value For Money) ROI ( Return On Investment) SORI (Social Return On Investment) and CBA (Cost Benefit Analysis)? Normally substantial budgets should only be alloca ted if prior research and piloting work indicates that the full implementation budgets will deliver acceptable levels of impact. 8. Have you put in place or authorised the mecha nisms to ensure that there is integration and alignment between all aspects of the proposed behaviour change programme and existing and or related in terventions at Local, N ational Regional , European and International levels ? Other intervention types can include legislation, fiscal measures, serv ice and vaccine delivery methods, and other related communication programmes such as those related to transport and work. 155 Proto T ool 14 Ensuring Effective Engagement in Pandemic Communication and Behavio ural Influencing Programmes 7 Point Checklist Important characteristics for designing effective behavio ural interventions that have fully engaged stakeholders, partner s and communities of interest. 1. Ensure interventions are citizen focused and driven by theory , evidence and research. Unde rstanding of the everyday lives and aspirations of the audience is essential. Use theory to ground and inform development learning from previous work. Draw from a wide range of different types of evidence. Look beyond the visible iceberg of published evidence to evidence locked in the experience and expertise of stakeholders, potential partner organizations, practitioners and communities themselves. Use a range of research methods to get a rounded understanding of what people do and why they do it. 2. Ensure explicit behavioural goals are agreed by all key stakeholders and Partners including community groups. Express the overall aims of the work in terms of specific behaviour SMART objectives. Avoid reliance on broad and general behavioural goals and instead tailor these to specific sub -groups and segments of the population. Ensure that all stakeholders and partners have had a chance to input into and shape the goals and objectives of the programme and that any disagreement or contentious issues have be en fully explored and if possible resolved. 3. Work to actively engage individuals and communities. Recognize that engagement is far more important than broadcast communication. Active involvement strengthens development, delivery and evaluation of any intervention. Ensure that a full stakeholder and partner analysis has been completed and that an ongoing management plan is developed. Ensure that a community engagement strategy is developed and sufficient resources are allocated to enable it to be fully implemented. 4. Invest in multi -sector partnership and mo bilizing 'delivery coalitions'. Partnership working significantly extends the reach, impact capacity and capability of interventions. Partnerships bring different perspectives, intelligence, eviden ce and expertise that can significantly enhance customer understanding and insight generation. Ensure that resources have been allocated to deliver effective communication and co -ordination between all coalition members. Ensure that communication systems a llow and facilitate the exchange of information such as data, research findings, tracking impact data and situational opportunities and threats. 5. Commit to a sustained approach that mobilizes resources and assets. Ensure all smaller -scale , time-specific interventions are developed and framed in the context of a broader, longer -term strategy or approach. Do not focus exclusively on financial resources. Map and build human skills and capacity a nd work to mobilize community action. Do not just 156 focus on 'deficits' and problems. Instead, frame interventions around mobilizing coalition and community assets and building latent strengths and capacities within individuals and communities. 6. Use an integrated model to connect national , regional and local efforts. Connecting interventions at different levels can significantly enhance potential impact and effectiveness. Focus on building links, connections and synergies between work at different levels. Recognize that this will take time, effort and th e investment of sustained resources. Organizing and planning interventions can be complex, and investing in co -ordination is critical. Summarizing, disseminating information and updates and co -ordinating work are key to ensuring effective stakeholder engag ement and coalition delivery. 7. Build a 'le arning and reflective' culture. The greatest resources available are the people, communities and practitioners involved in pandemic preparation and delivery systems. Capturing, valuing and sharing eviden ce of ef fectiveness and experience is important for programme evaluation, strengthening and sustaining work and for motivating people. Evidence and learning should be captured in a systematic way and disseminated actively. 157 Annex e Meta Reviews on Behavioural Change in Relation to Health Improvement, Relevant Reference M aterial and S ources Introduction This section of the paper provides an overview of the process and outcomes of a rapid trawl of relevant academic databases, key organisationa l sites such as WHO, NICE, etc. and the world wide web to identify meta reviews on behavioural change in relation to health improvement. The criteria used to limit the search were: Completion during the last seven years . The identification of meta reviews including systematic reviews, summary reviews and books focused on distilling new thinking on behaviour change . A focus on health improvemen t, particularly pandemic events, rather than a clinical or technical intervention focus . Limitations of R eport This report provides an insight into the extensive literature within this area , rather than being a systematic review of the literature or an exhaustive list of all the literature available in this area. It in no way endorses the findings of any of the lit erature or reviews, but rather provides a list of the identified literature and reviews in this area identified by the search strategy and meeting the inclusion criteria . As the NICE Public Health G uidance states, it should be noted that whilst : 'Reviews of reviews are a useful way of bringing together a large body of evidence, and consider broad questions, several limitations need to be acknowledged. Firstly, reviews do not always compare the same thing - some reviews examine outcome data studies, others look at more prospective studies (some consider both) - so interpretation of what is found is complicated by the state of the data pool. Secondly, some of the high quality reviews might contain poor quality evidence, because that is all that is available. Thirdly, some of the reviews might overlap, and include the same studies. Fourthly, even though no reviews have been done in a particular area (e.g. mass media interventions for preventing illicit drug use), this does not mean that there is not a large bod y of good primary evidence on that topic. Finally, when looking at the evidence in reviews , we may be limited by the questions that the review authors have decided are important. These may not be the same questions that we have prioritised.' Methodology An indicative topic analysis was performed to define the search terms, and identify potentially relev ant disciplines for the topic. This enabled the identification of relevant databases to focus the search strategy. Citation analysis techniques were utilised to identify key seminal works, enabling the collation of an index of key terms which were utilised in behavioural change literature to focus the trawl of the avai lable literature. [See Table1 ] 158 Table 1: Inclusion Criteria Category Criteria Scope Systematic reviews . Evidence based reviews . Meta-analyses . Conceptual boundaries Behaviour change . Social marketing . Health improvement . Interventions Throughout the literature, the concept of attempts to promote or support behaviour change is reflected in a large number of ways. Terms utilised to identify suc h interventions in this review includ e: initiative, scheme, action, activity, campaign, policy, strategy, procedure, programme, intervention and project. Disciplines Behavioural economi cs. Behavioural psychology . Social psychology . Social marketing . Health improvement . Health promotion . Health communication . Public health . Focal points Pandemic . Outbreak control . Outbreak management . H1N1 . Language English . Year of publication Between 2005 and 2012 . Exclusions Learning disabilities . Papers with an explicit clinical or treatment focus or which suggested technical interventions, e.g. tar reduction in cigarettes . Searches were conducted initially on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) for English language systematic reviews date limited to between 2005 -2012. This enabled the primary identif ication of systematic reviews from a respected source. Alongside this search, a number of other academic databases and websites were trawled to ensure broad data capture. A full list of the academic databases and websites searched is appended at Annex e A. These searches were restricted by additional terms including 'review', 'meta -analysis', 'evidence -based review' or 'systematic review'. In addition, an email was also sent out via a public health academic e -group to identify any relevant 'grey literature ', but with very limited success. Whilst the initial review identified a significant number of studies within the general topic areas, subsequent analysis of the abstracts for these studies showed that the majority of the 159 reviews focused on technical interventions, such as reducing the tar content in cigarettes, or provision of placebos, rather than behaviour modification. Such studies were excluded from this report. Studies on H1N1 and pandemic and outbreak management an d control were largely about the effectiveness of interventions, e.g. treatments, rather than focused on behaviours associated with uptake of these treatments. One study348, which focused on physical interventions to address respiratory viruses, has been i ncluded within this document because it provides an insight into a range of interventions which could be considered. Many of the interventions proposed could be considered as potential interventions within a behaviourally focused programme of activity. The identified reviews were compared with the primary inclusion criteria summarised in Table 1 to determine the relevance of the identified reviews. A full list of the references identified as meeting the primary inclusion criteria is attached at Annex e B. As a secondary stage of analysis, once papers had passed the primary inclusion criteria, the articles and full text chapters, where available, were accessed. The reference lists of included reviews were searched to identify other reviews included within their analysis which had not been otherwise identified. This informed the development of the summary list of selected reviews appended at Annex e C.

The six health behaviours considered here are: Cigarette smoking Alcohol drinking (excluding alcohol dependency) Physical activity Healthy eating (excluding diet for weight loss) Illicit drug use (excluding drug dependency) Sexual risk taking in young people The main objectives Evidence statements were drawn up based on the level of evidence, the efficacy of the intervention and the applicability of the research question to the UK. 194 Author and Date Review T ype Study P opulation Review O bjective Key R esults were to evaluate: Which are the most effective interventions to change knowledge, attitudes and health behaviours in each of these six areas? Is there any evidence to suggest that some interventions are effective / ineffective across the range of health behavi ours? Which are the most effective models and approaches used in these interventions? What is the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in targeting health inequalities within particular population sub-groups? What are the gaps in the evide nce base? NICE 2007 Behaviour change: Review 2 - Road safety Road Safety Three topic areas were selected on the basis of their relevance to the guidance and their potential for yielding useful evi dence: Road safety Pro -environmental behaviour change Marketing to low income consumers The aim was to gather evidence on behaviour change from other fields, such as marketing, psychology, the environment or criminal justice, which might transfer to or yield useful learning for public health interventions.

NICE 2007 Behaviour change: Review 3 - Resilience, coping and salutogenic approaches to maintaining and generating health Resilience, coping and salutogenic approaches to maintaining and generating health The review is divided into t wo sections. The first section: 'characteristics of approaches to maintaining and generating health' aims to consider the theoretical frameworks used by research in this area, the approaches of researchers to these three areas and how these theories and areas of research have been applied to practice based interventions.

NICE 2007 Behaviour change: Review 4 - Models Literature review Review of behaviour change models . None of the models examined in this review is specified adequately to incorporate and interpret the significance of social, economic and/or environmental factors as predictors and determinants of health behavio ur. Many of the components and psychological constructs they contain relate to cognitions and perceptions that are a function of 'subjects' responses to their environments. Suggests models not generally used effectively . NICE 2007 Behaviour change: Review 5 - Socio -cultural context Literature review This review sought to identify and evaluate evidence relating to how the social and cultural context in w hich people live influences the effectiveness of interventions to change health knowledge, attitudes, intensions and behaviours. Variations in health behaviours and outcomes are strongly linked to socio -economic and allied variables. The search conducted for this review found no studies that had investigated in any significant depth the mechanisms underpinning relationships between income and social positioning and the success or otherwise of health behaviour interventions. There also appears to be a lack of focused research evidence on the extent to which, and why, members of ethnic minority groups may benefit from culturally specific health behaviour change interventions, over and above the benefits that they can gain f rom less specifically targeted interventions. NICE 2007 Behaviour change: Review 6 - Social marketing Literature and narrative review It draws upon several types of evidence: - a narrative review on the nature of marketing and social marketing as behaviour change techniques (Section 3) - a review of marketing strategies for low -income consumers (Section 4) - a recent systematic review of the extent and nature of food promotion to children and its effects on their food knowledge, preferences and behaviour (Section 5) - a series of reviews of social marketing effectiveness in changing health The report identifies several key, fairly generic learn ing points for public health: - Move away from a prescriptive approach and 'get to know' the target group(s). Seek to understand the problem from their perspective - identify their motivations and the factors that influence their behaviour. These in sights are particularly important when trying to influence 'hard -to-reach' groups like low -income households. Formative research can be a useful navigational aid and can help provide some of this understanding. - Group individuals according to the similarity of their needs then identify the most appropriate group(s) around whom to organise the marketing effort. Develop a marketing strategy that utilises the various elements of the marketing mix (e .g. promotion, distribution, product) and is tailored to the specific requirements of the target group(s). - Identify any competition to behaviour change that exists (e.g. apathy, effort, time) and consider how to best remove or minimise its influence. It is critical to make it easy for people to adopt new behaviours, especially in the case of vulnerable groups (e .g. children, low -income) who face extra difficu lties. An insider perspective of these difficulties can be especially insightful and can highlight problems that may be otherwi se difficult to detect. 196 Author and Date Review T ype Study P opulation Review O bjective Key R esults behaviours (Section 6). -In the past marketers viewed the low -income market as 'problematic ', alienated and difficult to reach. However, they soon realised that this was because they were not communicating with low -income consumers in the right way an d were offering them products and services not suited to their needs. Following a change in mindset - and by listening to their needs , marketers discovered that they could engage with low income consumers and successfully influence their behaviour . The public health community should adopt a similar mindset when trying to influence this group. - In public health, positive emotion and branding are potentially useful but typically underused (in huge contrast to commercial marketing). Considerati on should be given to the use of positively framed and upbeat messages (e .g. Stressing the benefits to be gained from a healthy lifestyle rather than the consequences of an unhealthy one). Convenience is especially important among the low- income market. The commercial sector has learned to bring messages and services to this group by infiltrating local communities, engaging in grassroots marketing and providing a range of services under one roof. A grassroots approach is helpful for tackling issues of mistrust. The public health community could make use of some of these strategies to help to penetrate the low -income sector. It is important to do things over and over again. For example, food marketers advertise to children continuously because they know that repeated exposure to advertising increases its effectiveness. Stakeholders and other key influencers should be identified and accounted for in the marketing strategy. The target group's environment should be addressed and 'upstre am' change targeted where appropriate. Like the commercial sector, the public health community should also engage in long term thinking and view engagement with the target group(s) as strategic on -going relationships, not discrete interactions.

Evidence review Analyzed data from 4040 U.S. adult members of a nationally representative online panel surveyed between March 4th and March 24th, 2010 The existence of two vaccines -seasonal and pandemic - created the potential for confusion and misinformation among consumers during the 2009 - 2010 vaccination season. The purpose of the review was to measure the frequency and nature of influenza vaccination communication between healthcare providers and adults for both seasonal and 2009 influenza A (H1N1) vaccinat ion and quantified its association with uptake of the two vaccines. RESULTS: 64.1% (95% -CI: 61.5% -66.6%) of adults did not receive any provider -issued influenza vaccination recommendation. Adults who received a provider -issued vaccination recommendati on were 14.1 (95% to 32.1 (95% -CI: 24.3 -39.8) percentage points more likely to be vaccinated for influenza than adults without a provider recommendation, after adjusting for other characteristics associated with vaccination. CONCLUSI ONS: Influenza vaccination communication between healthcare providers and adults was relatively uncommon during the 2009 -2010 pandemic. Increased communication could significantly enhance influenza vaccination rates. Bish A , Yardley L , Sep 2;29(38):6472 -84. Epub 2011 Jul 12. Factors associated with uptake of vaccination against pandemic influenza: a systematic review. A systematic literature review searching Web of Science and PubMed databases up to 24 January 2011. To examine the psychological and demographic factors associated with uptake of vaccination during the 2009 pandemic. The review found that both the degree of threat experienced in the 20 09 pandemic influenza outbreak and perceptions of vaccination as an effective coping strategy were associated with stronger intentions and higher uptake of vaccination. Appraisal of threat resulted from both believing oneself to be at risk from develop ing H1N1 influenza and concern and worry about the disease. Appraisal of coping resulted from concerns about the safety of the vaccine and its side effects. There was evidence of an influence of social pressure in that people who thought that others wanted them to be vaccinated were more likely to do so and people getting their information about vaccination from official health sources being more likely to be vaccinated than those relying on unoffic ial sources. There was also a strong influence of past behaviour, with those having been vaccinated in the past against seasonal influenza being more likely to be vaccinated against pandemic influenza. Demographic factors associated with higher inten tions and uptake of vaccination were: older age, male gender, being from an ethnic minority and, for health professionals, being a doctor. Interventions designed to increase vaccination rates could be developed and implemented in advance of a pandemic . Strategies to improve uptake of vaccination include interventions which highlight the risk posed by pandemic influenza while simultaneously offering tactics to ameliorate this risk (e.g. vaccination). Perceived concerns about vaccination can be tac kled by reducing the omission bias (a perception that harm caused by action is worse than harm caused by inaction). In addition, interventions to increase seasonal influenza vaccination in advance of a future pandemic may be an effective strategy. 198 Author and Date Review T ype Study P opulation Review O bjective Key R esults Poland GA . Vaccine. 2010 Sep Suppl 4:D3 -13. The 2009 -2010 influe nza pandemic: effects on pandemic and seasonal vaccine uptake and lessons learned for seasonal vaccination campaigns. Evidence review Individual and national/cultural differences were apparent in response to the 2009 -2010 influenza pandemic. Overall pande mic influenza immunization rates were low across all nations, including among healthcare workers. To review cross - cultural responses to pandemic influenza, and seek to apply those lessons to seasonal influenza immunization program mes. Among the reasons for the low coverage rates it may have been a lack of concern about the individual risk of influenza, which may translate into a lack of willingness or urgency to be vaccinated, particularly if there is mistrust of information by public health or governme ntal authorities. Intuitively, a link between willingness to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza and against pandemic influenza exists, given the similarities in decision -making for this infection. As such, the public is likely to share common concerns regarding pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccination, particularly in the areas of vaccine safety, side effects and personal risk. Given the public's perception of the low level of virulence of the recent pandemic influenza virus, there is c oncern that the perception of a lack of personal risk of infection and risk of vaccine side effects could adversely affect seasonal vaccine uptake. While governments are more often concerned about public anxiety and panic, as well as absenteeism of he althcare and other essential workers during a pandemic, convincing the public of the threat posed by pandemic or seasonal influenza is often the and underappreciated task. Appropriate, timely, and data -driven health information are very important is sues in increasing influenza vaccine coverage, perhaps even more so in western societies where trust in government and public health reports may be lower than in other countries.

Literature review Influenza vaccination coverage among healthcare workers (HCW) is insufficient despite health authority recommendations in many countries. Numerous vaccination campaigns encouraging HCW to be vaccinated have met with resistance. To review the published influenza vaccination program mes in healthcare settings , to understand the reasons for their success and failure, as well as the attitudes and beliefs of HCW. RESULTS: Thirty -two studies performed between 1985 and 2002 reported vaccination rates of 2.1 -82%. Vaccination campaigns including easy access to free vaccine and an educational program me tended to obtain the highest up take, particularly in the USA. Yet, even this type of campaign was not always successful. Two main barriers to satisfactory vaccine uptake were consistently reported : (1) misperception of influenza, its risks, the role of HCW in its transmission to patients, and the importance and risks of vaccination (2) lack of (or perceived lack of) conveniently available vaccine. To overcome these barriers and increase uptake, vaccination campaigns must be carefully designed and implemented taking account of the specific needs at each healthcare institution.

Maximising the impact of communications campaigns that promote protective behaviou rs during future pandemics is therefore important. The results show that psychological processes are important to consider when designing campaigns. 2.Rapid -turnaround surveys can be useful as part of a public health response to evaluate whether communications campaigns have had an effect on behaviour and to identify what factors mediated this process. However, in order to get the most out of analysing such data, it is important that the most appropriate constructs are measured using wording and response options that maximise reliability and validity of measurement. This is true both of psychological predictors and of self -report measures of behaviour.

To assess what percentage of the public had performed recommended and non recommended behaviours in the early stages of the outbreak. 5. To assess whether people who had been exposed to media coverage or advertising about swine flu were more likely to perform recommended or non-recommended behaviours, and to assess whether effects of media coverage or advertising were due to changes in knowledge about swine flu, levels of worry about the possibility of catching swine flu or perceptions about the efficacy of scientists on these issues is recommended in any future outbreak. It is also recommended that a model template for such a survey be designed in advance of a future pandemic. 3.During a future outbreak, raising levels of worry about the possibility of catching a disease from low levels is likely to increase uptake of behavioural recommendations. However, it is also likely to increase uptake of non-recommended behaviours. Conversely, attempts to reassure the public about their chances of becoming ill during a future infectious disease outbreak ar e likely to reduce rates of behaviour change. How to steer the best course in the face of these conflicting influences requires the application of general principles to the specifics of any particular situation. 4.Emphasising the efficacy of recommend ed behaviours in any future campaign should help to maximise the campaign s impact on those behaviours. Importantly, although increasing levels of worry might increase rates of all protective behaviours, regardless of whether they had been recommended or not, the results suggest that communicating the efficacy of a specific behaviour may have an impact on that behaviour alone. 200 Author and Date Review T ype Study P opulation Review O bjective Key R esults different protective actions.

Preventing transmission of H1N1 and other infectious diseases can require individuals to change behavio urs, but recommendations to change behavio ur can run counter to other powerful influences. For example, instructions not to shake hands or avoid certain public gatherings can run counter to substantial social pr essures to shake hands or be in attendance. These behavio ural conflicts are illustrated with an experience of the relative ineffectiveness of voluntary recommendations, which highlights the importance of considering these social pressures when determining what recommendations to make and how to make them.

The analysis is based on 'Control Theory ', which suggests that behaviour change is most likely if feedback is accompanied by comparison with a behavioural target and by action plans, and the authors coded interventions for these three techniques. Multivariate meta -regression was performed on 85 comparisons from 61 studies. However, few interventions incorporated targets or action plans, and so meta -regression models were likely to be under fitted due to insufficient po wer. The utility of the approach could not be tested via the analysis because of the limited nature of the audit and feedback interventions. Conceptualising and categorising interventions using behaviour change theory can reveal the theoretical coherence of interventions and so point towards improvements in intervention design, evaluation and synthesis. The results demonstrate that a theory -based approach to evidence synthesis is feasible, and can prove beneficial in understanding intervention design, even where there is insufficient empirical evidence to reliably synthesise effects of specific intervention components.

Systematic review Of 9766 papers identified by the search strategy, 13 met the inclusion criteria Investigated the effectiveness of interventions targeting low -income groups to reduce smoking or increase physical activity and/or healthy eating. Interventions were heterogeneous, comprising 4 -19 techniques. Nine interventions had positive effects, seven resulted in no change and one had an adverse effect. Effective interventions had a tendency to have fewer techniques than ineffective interventions, with no evidence for any technique being generally effective or ineffective. Only six studies cited theory relative to intervention development, with little information about how theory was used a nd no obvious association with intervention content or effect. Marynissen HM . Acta Chir Belg. 2011 Jul - Aug;111(4):193 -9. The relationship between organisational communication and perception. Review Reviews different communication theories, points out key concepts in the literature on individual and collective perceptions, and suggests directions to further research . This paper argues that to influence the receivers' perception, a specific form of communication that is embedded in a specific organisational culture is required. It also demands prior knowledge of the existing organisational schemata and the current perception concerning the topic that has to be communicated. The rationale is that three obstacles hinder the objectives of traditional communication strategies to influence perception according to the sender's objectives. The first challenge is that a receiver of a certain message never garners one single, clearly pronounced message conveyed by one single pers on. The second strain is the dual mode of thinking that forms organisational members' perceptions: the heuristic and the cogitative (Taleb, 2010). Most organisational communication theories are based on the paradigm in which receivers of information process this information in a rational way, while research in the field of neurobiology (Lehrer, 2009) indicates that rationality is dominated by emotions. The third difficulty is that organisational members constrain to well -established, ingrained s chemas (Labianca et al., 2000; Balogun and Johnson, 2004). Based on these existing schemas, the scattered information from multiple sources, and the inability 203 Author and Date Review T ype Study P opulation Review O bjective Key R esults to process that information through cognitive reasonin g, organisational members construct perceptions that are not in line with the objectives of the sender's communication . to promote healthy behaviours in pati ents?

Review of systematic reviews Included : 23 systematic reviews: 14 on smoking cessation, 6 on physical exercise, and 2 on healthy diets and 1 on both exercise and diets. To identify the evidence for the effectiveness of behaviour change techniques, when used by health -care professionals, in accomplishing health-promoting behaviours in patients . None of the behaviour change techniques demonstrated clear effects in a convincing majority of the studies in which they were evaluated. Techniques targeting knowledge (n = 210 studies) and facilitation of behaviour (n = 172) were evaluated most frequently. However, self -monitoring of behaviour (positive effects in 56% of the studies), risk communication (52%) and use of social support (50%) were most often identified as effective. Insufficient insight into appropriateness of technique choice and quality of technique delivery hinder precise conclusions. Relatively, however, self -monitoring of behaviour, risk communication and use of social support are most Effective Health professionals should avoid thinking that providing knowledge, materials and professional support will be sufficient for patients to accomplish change and consider alternative strategies which may be more effective.

Review Review of research programme on prevention of chronic disease and its outcomes . Aims to show how behavioural science can contribute to primary care research, specifically in relation to the development and evaluation of interventions to change behaviour. Concludes with a number of recommendations: (i) whether the aim is prediction, explanati on or change , defining the target behaviour is a crucial first step; (ii) interventions should be explicitly based on theories that specify the factors that need to be changed in order to produce the desired change in behaviour; (iii) intervention developers need to be aware of the differences between different theories and select a theory only after careful consideration of the alternatives assessed against relevant criteria; and (iv) developers need to be aware that interventions can never be entirely theory based.

Review of grey literature Study design: Sourcing, reviewing and analysis of 36 pieces of relevant grey literature. This study identified and reviewed grey literature relating to factors facilitating and inhibiting effective interventions in three areas: the promotion of mental health and well - being, the improvement of food and nutrition, and interventions seeking to increase engagement in physical activity. A variety of approaches, often short -term, were used both as interventions and outcome measures. Interventions tended to have common outcom es, enabling the identification of themes. These included improvements in participant well -being as well as identification of barriers to, and promoters of, success. Most interventions demonstrated some positive impact, although some did not. This was particularly the case for more objective measures of change, such as physiological measurements, particularly when used to evaluate short -term interventions. Objective health measurement as part of an i ntervention may act as a catalyst for future behaviour change. Time is an important factor that could either promote or impede the success of interventions for both participants and facilitators. Likewise, the importance of involving all stakeholders, including participants, when planning health promoting interventions was established as an important indicator of success.

Review Included 103 reviews published between 1995 and 2008. The focus of interventions varied, but those targeting specific individuals were generally designed to change an existing behaviour (e.g. cigarette sm oking, alcohol misuse), To identify interventions that are effective in achieving behavioural change . Interve ntions that were most effective across a range of health behaviours included physician advice or individual counselling, and workplace - and s chool based activities. Mass media campaigns and legislative interventions also showed small to moderate effec ts in changing health behaviours. Generally, the evidence related to short -term effects rather than sustained/longer -term impact and there was a relative lack of evidence on how best to address inequalities. 204 Author and Date Review T ype Study P opulation Review O bjective Key R esults whilst those aimed at the general population or groups such as school children were designed to promote positive behaviours (e.g. healthy eating).

The authors assess what contributes to these outcomes, such as concurrent availability of required services and products, availability of community -based programmes, and policies that support behaviour change. They propose areas for improvement, su ch as investment in longer better -funded campaigns to achieve adequate population exposure to media messages. J Health Commun. 2011 Aug;16 Suppl 2:82 -93.

Review Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched for references to papers on severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza/flu, H5N1, swine influenza/flu, H1N1, and pandemics. Forward searching of the identified references was also carried out. In addition, references were gleaned from an expert panel of the Behaviour and Communications sub-group of the UK Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Group. Papers were included if they reported associations between demographic factors, attitudes, and a be havioural measure (reported, intended, or actual behaviour). To identify the key demographic and attitudinal determinants of three types of protective behaviour during a pandemic: preventive, avoidant, and management of illness behaviours, in order to desc ribe conceptual frameworks in which to better understand these behaviours and to inform future communications and interventions in the current outbreak of swine flu and subsequent influenza pandemics. The research shows that there are demographic differen ces in behaviour: being older, female and more educated, or non -White, is associated with a higher chance of adopting the behaviours. There is evidence that greater levels of perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of the diseases and greate r belief in the effectiveness of recommended behaviours to protect against the disease are important predictors of behaviour. There is also evidence that greater levels of state anxiety and greater trust in authorities are associated with behaviour. Gesundheitswesen. 2009 Jun;71(6):351 -7. Epub 2009 Jun 15.

Epidemiological and economic modelling studies have shown that, in comparison to travel restrictions, applying intervention measures to interrupt local transmission within a country and investing into vacci ne research and anti -viral stock piling, is a more cost -effective and efficient use of resources for the containment of pandemics. A study investigating the perceived threat associated with pandemics showed that the subjective risk perception of people varies among countries. This influences human behaviour and should hence be considered during risk communication and implementation of pandemic control measures.

Kavanagh AM, Bentley RJ, Mason KE, McVernon J, Petrony S, Fielding J, LaMontagne AD, Studdert DM. Review Australian school children and their families To examine whether compliance with quarantine recommendations was associated with understanding and the type of information source used. Voluntary home quarantine of cases and close contacts was the main non-pharmaceutical intervention used to limit transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza (pH1N1) in the initial response to the outbreak of the disease in Australia. The effectiveness of voluntary quarantine logically depends on affected families h aving a clear understanding of what they are being asked to do. Information may come from many sources, including the media, health officials, family and friends, schools, and health professionals. The authors report the extent to which families who entered home quarantine received and used information on what they were supposed to do. Specifically, they outline their sources of information; the perceived usefulness of each source; and associations between understanding of recommendations and compliance.

Gordon, R., The effectiveness of social marketing interventions for health improvement : what's the evidence? 2006. Systematic review 3 reviews included To review the effectiveness of social marketing interventions designed to improve diet, increase physical activity, and tackle substance misuse . The reviews provide evidence that social marketing interventions can be effective in improving diet, i increasing exercise, and tackling the misuse of substances like alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. There is evidence that social marketing interventions can work with a range of target groups, in different settings, and can work upstream as well as w ith individuals.

Looks at how changes have been met with shifts in the public acceptance of the relevant vaccine. These shifts are characterized not only by the number of people willi ng to be vaccinated, but also by the attitudes and the motives related to acceptance. Examination of the inter -relationship between changes in vaccination realities, and changes in acceptance patterns suggests that today, the public has a better unde rstanding of vaccination, is acting in a more reflexive way, and is capable of changing attitudes and behavior. All together, changes in vaccination enhance debates and dialogues about vaccines, and lead to higher awareness and more conscious acceptanc e.

The setting is th e Internet as indexed by Google with aggregated Internet user data. The main outcome measures were the frequency of \"hits\" or webpages containing terms relating to natural supplements co - occurring with H1N1/swine flu, terms relating to natural supplements co-occurring with H1N1/swine flu proportional to all terms relating to natural supplements, webpage rank, webpage entropy, and temporal trend in search activity.

The prevalence of non -authoritative web pages with information about supplements in the context of H1N1/swine flu and the increasing number of searches for these pages suggest that the public is interested in alternatives to traditional prevention and treatment of H1N1. The quality of this information is often questionable and clinicians should be cognizant that patients may be at risk of adverse events associated with the use of supplements for H1N1.

BMC Public Health. 2011 Jan 3;11:2. Review of survey data Netherlands The aim of this study was to examine perceptions and behaviours of the general public during the early phase of the Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Between May and August 2009, the level of knowledge regarding Influen za A (H1N1) increased, while perceived severity of the new flu, perceived self-efficacy, and intention to comply with preventive measures decreased. The perceived reliability of information from the government decreased from May to August (62% versus 45%). Feelings of anxiety decreased from May to June, and remained stable afterwards. From June to August 2009, perceived vulnerability increased and more respondents took preventive measures (14% versus 38%). Taking preventive measures was associated with no children in the household, high anxiety, high self -efficacy, more agreement with statements on avoidance, and paying much attention to media information regarding Influenza A (H1N1). Having a strong intention to comply with government -advised preventive measures in the future was associated with higher age, high 209 Author and Date Review T ype Study P opulation Review O bjective Key R esults perceived severity, high anxiety, high perceived efficacy of measures, high self -efficacy, and finding Governmental information to be reliable. CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing trends over time in perceived severity and anxiety are consistent with the reality: the clinical picture of influenza turned out to be mild in course of time. Although (inter)national health authorities initially overestimated the case fatality rate, the public stayed calm and remained to have a relatively high intention to comply with preventive measures.

Although the epidemiological aspects of the three 20th century influenza pandemics have been widely investigated, little is known about population behaviour in a pandemic situation. Such knowledge is however critical, notably for predicting population compliance with non pharmaceutical interventions. Although the evidence base of most non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and personal protection measures is debated, it appears on the basis of past experience that NPIs implemented the most systematically, the earliest, and for the longest time could reduce overall mortality rates and spread out epidemic peaks. Adequate, transparent, and targeted communication on the part of public health authori ties would be also of crucial importance in the event of a serious influenza pandemic.
