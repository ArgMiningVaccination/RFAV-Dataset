Whereas 200,000 people died as a result of conflict or war in Africa in 1998, AIDS killed 2.2 million. Theprogression of the disease has outpaced all projections. In 1991, WHOprojected that in 1999 there would be 9 million infected individuals and nearly5 million cumulative deaths in Africa. The reality in 2000 is two to three timeshigher, with 34.3 million infected individuals and 18.8 cumulative deaths. Nearly 70 per cent of the world 's HIV infection and 90 per cent of deaths from AIDS are to be found in a region that is home to just 10 per cent of the world 's population. In the sub-Saharan region, infection levels are highest, access tocare is lowest, and social and economic safety nets that might help familiescope with the impact of the epidemic are badly frayed. Resources are notkeeping pace with the challenge. Incidence of the disease is increasing threetimes faster than the money to control it. Current national AIDS activities in Africa must be expanded dramatically to make an impact on the epidemic. African leaders are demonstratingunprecedented leadership in fighting HIV/AIDS; the time is ripe for anextraordinary effort. The International Partnership against AIDS in Africa(IPAA) is such a mobilization. At the same time, the Best Practice process - accumulating and applying knowledge about what is working and not workingin different situations and contexts - is crucial within the framework of the Partnership. The International Partnership against AIDS in Africa The IPAA is a coalition of actors who have chosen to work together to achievea shared vision and common goals, based on mutually agreed upon principlesand key milestones. Its purpose is to establish and maintain processes by which governments, civil society, and especially the community sector andnational and international organizations working against AIDS in Africa, canwork together more effectively to curtail the spread of HIV, sharply reduce thehuman suffering it produces, and reverse the human, social, and economicerosion in Africa.(For more on the IPAA, see www.unaids.org/africapartnership/index.html.) The actors in the IPAA are African governments, the United Nations, donors, the private sector, 1 and the community sector.2 3 The IPAA can be 1 The private sector includes diverse groups such as multinational corporations, pharmaceutical firms, foundations, and trade unions. 2 Under the Partnership, the community sector will be understood to start from individuals, families, and communities who have organized themselves on basis of geographic, constituent, and thematic areas/G03 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSunderstood as a series of overlapping partnerships at different levels, and among different actors, working to common objectives. At the country level, members of the IPAA undertake to work under the leadership of national governments within a common, strategic framework,frequently called a \"national strategic plan for HIV/AIDS. \" To be effective, this framework will identify core strategic and programmatic areas for intervention,and the role of different actors. /G01 At the regional and subregional level, members will build on existing mechanisms for collaboration in strengthening and developing regionalresources, such as technical resource networks, available for rapiddrawdown by national programmes seeking technical advice and training. /G01 At the global level, the IPAA will identify processes and products in which to invest collectively. These will include intensifying action in areas rangingfrom international public goods to political processes, focusing on thoseareas where coordinated efforts are likely to have an impact as well asthose that are likely to result in greater visibility and resources to fight theepidemic. The benefits of partnership The partners believe that the synergy created by working with others will dramatically enhance the impact of individual actions, allowing the participantsto continue to build on Best Practices at every level. As designed and agreed to by the partners, the value added by the IPAA lies in the following features: /G01 A coordinated response: In most countries there is immediate scope for improved coordination. Introducing the flexibility to identify gaps and improveefficiency in nationally negotiated plans will be a significant step forward inmany countries. /G01 A scaled-up response through more resources and better use of existing resources: Resources are more likely to flow towards well-designed, clearlycosted, and well-implemented programmes, especially where it is clear thatmechanisms are in place for moving resources to district and community levels. /G01 A linked response: The IPAA will ensure that countries are properly linked to subregional, regional, and international resources and initiatives. By improvingcommunications and the quality of information and, where necessary, ensuringthat brokering functions are performed, the Partnership will ensure thatcountries are able to benefit from other international and regional investments to respond to the epidemic. The community sector includes national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), religious organizations, traditionalhealers, youth organizations, women 's networks, networks of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), media houses, and special interest groups. 3 Participating actors in the Partnership include national academic and research institutions.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G04in addressing the epidemic, including through Best Practice development, information, commodities, or technical expertise. /G01 A response based on the Best Practices learned from two decades of experience with the epidemic: Experience from two decades of the epidemichas generated a considerable body of good practice. A vision of action The International Partnership against AIDS in Africa proceeds from the vision that, within the next decade, African nations, with the support of the internationalcommunity, will be implementing larger-scale, sustained, and more effectivemultisectoral national responses to HIV/AIDS. Through collective efforts, promotionand protection of human rights, and promotion of poverty alleviation, countries will: /G01 substantially reduce new HIV infections /G01 provide a continuum of care for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS /G01 mobilize and support communities, NGOs, the private sector, and individuals to counteract the negative impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. Best Practice in the response to AIDS Identifying practices around the world that work in responding to the AIDSepidemic, and examining how and why they work, is one of the UNAIDSSecretariat 's main tasks. UNAIDS and its cosponsors promote the sharing of these practices, including through such means as documentation andwidespread distribution of the lessons learned. The concept of Best Practice is not reserved for \"ultimate truths\" or \"gold standards.\" For UNAIDS, Best Practice means accumulating and applyingknowledge about what is working and not working in different situations andcontexts. In other words, it is both the lessons learned and the continuing process of learning, feedback, reflection, and analysis (what works, how andwhy, and so forth). At its most basic, Best Practice suggests a simple maxim: Don 't reinvent the wheel; learn in order to improve it, and adapt it to your terrain to make it workbetter. The process of Best Practice is manifested in three ways: /G01 exchange of experience, including sharing between individual experts and Technical Resource Networks (TRNs) /G01 pilot testing, operations research, and other projects and programmes /G01 documentation including formats such as audiovisual cassettes, CDs, and presentation graphics (however, it is important to remember that BestPractice is not simply documentation, but an approach to sharing andusing knowledge)./G05 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSIdentifying Best Practice that provides useful \"lessons learned \" means making judgements. To arrive at such judgements, two approaches may be used,each reflecting a different level of analysis. The first approach is based on a simple description of the practice's accomplishments. From this point of view, Best Practice can be anything thatworks, in full or in part, and that can be useful in providing lessons learned. The second approach is to carry out a thorough analysis using specific, established criteria that look at strengths and weaknesses, successes andfailures. UNAIDS uses a set of five criteria as a guide: effectiveness,efficiency, relevance, ethical soundness, and sustainability. While candidateBest Practices should meet one or more of the criteria, they do not need tomeet them all. In summary, the Best Practice process helps to identify and describe the lessons learned and the keys to success of any given project, programme, orpolicy. Why document Best Practice? Our UNAIDS cosponsors, in-country staff, and Secretariat in Geneva are constantly asked to provide brief and up-to-date information - \"snapshots \" might be a good description - about the constructive and creative things that people and organizations around the world are doing about HIV/AIDS. This isa practical illustration of one of the main reasons we document anddisseminate Best Practice. Without access to existing knowledge andexperience from the field of things that work, whether fully or in part, mistakesmay be repeated and valuable time may be lost. Lessons learned must bewidely shared and adapted to local conditions in order to enable an effectiveresponse to the epidemic. The formal objectives of Best Practice are: /G01 to strengthen the capacity to identify, document, exchange, promote, use, and adapt Best Practice as lessons learned within a country and betweencountries as a means to expand the national response to HIV/AIDS /G01 to promote the application of the Best Practice process for policy and strategy definition and formulation /G01 to collect, produce, disseminate, and promote Best Practice. In this Summary Booklet, UNAIDS attempts to capture details of a range of Best Practices in order to provide useful lessons and offer references forthose working in HIV/AIDS-related activities. In this booklet, UNAIDS attempts to capture details of a range of Best Practices in sub-Saharan Africa in order to provide useful lessons and offerreferences for all actors of the IPAA. It is by no means comprehensive or complete: there are many other Best Practices in Africa that have beendocumented in the previous issue of the Best Practices Summary Booklet orwill be documented in upcoming issues.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G06Where do Best Practices come from? Sources of Best Practice are wide. They include UN system staff, non- governmental organizations, government representatives and agencies,community groups, and individuals. Sometimes Best Practice is identifiedthrough small or mass media. UNAIDS gratefully acknowledges the work of itsstaff, but especially acknowledges the diligent efforts of the field staff of itscosponsors (UNDCP, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, and theWorld Bank), the chairs of the United Nations Theme Groups on HIV/AIDS,and other partners to provide the lessons learned for the summary booklet. Submissions usually arrived in electronic files, often with detailed supporting documents. Others, sometimes hand-written, arrive in the mail from non-governmental and community organizations and from independentresearchers - that is, from people working on the front lines of the response to HIV/AIDS. Some of these have been accepted for publication almostverbatim. Still others have been gleaned from journals, project reports, andeven from newspapers and magazines. While some of the practices have been the subject of formal evaluation processes, most have not. This may seem odd in a publication devoted toBest Practice, but there is a reason for it that is based solidly in the reality ofthe HIV/AIDS epidemic. Formal evaluation of the type practised by academicand government institutions is often a slow, complicated, and expensiveprocess that can take more professional time and cost more than the actualprocess being evaluated - and that should be planned as part of a practice's life span. The majority of practices detailed in this summary were orientedtowards action rather than methodological \"purity\"; many were formed by grassroots organizations and individuals, few of which have the resources orin-house expertise for formal evaluation. For this reason, many of the practices do not present evaluation information per se. In all cases, however, the outcomes and lessons learned provide whatever information is available on outputs and impacts. Using the Summary Booklet Currently, UNAIDS collects and publishes information on over 50 topic areas related to HIV/AIDS. The practices described in this summary are organized,first, according to their main topic areas. Each practice is preceded by a briefintroduction to the topic. Since most practices are relevant to more than onetopic area (for instance, a national fund for high-cost drugs would becategorized first under access to drugs, but it is also related to human rights,ethics, and law), an index is provided at the end of the summary. This permitspractices to be found by their secondary topic areas, as well as by country. We have tried to provide complete contact information so that readers can get additional information on practices that interest them. Where possible, eachpractice contains a section called Further Reading, in which readers will findbibliographic references for obtaining more information (some of this isavailable on the Internet, and full electronic addresses are provided. Anelectronic version of the full Summary Booklet database is available atwww.unaids.org/bestpractice/collection/summary/index.html.)/G07 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSWe welcome your proposals The entries in this booklet deal only with sub-Saharan Africa, and represent only some of the many reports and suggestions that we received. Later issueswill, like the first volume in 1999, cover Best Practices from all continents. Wethank all those who submitted proposals, whether they were included in thisissue or not. This publication includes a proposal submission form at the end, which readers can use to propose other practices. The form can also be downloadedfrom the UNAIDS' web page. Submissions have the best chance of beingaccepted for publication if they are sent via the UN Theme Group onHIV/AIDS or the UNAIDS Country Programme Adviser in each country (with acopy to the UNAIDS Best Practice Coordinator at the UNAIDS Secretariat inGeneva). Annex 2 contains the relevant addresses in sub-Saharan Africa. As well, UNAIDS welcomes any comments and suggestions that will help us make this summary better and more complete. Please address these to theBest Practice Coordinator, PSR, at the UNAIDS Secretariat in Geneva.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G08Best PracticesSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G0A Children and young people Young people are key to the future course of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The behaviours they adopt now and those they maintain throughout their lives willdetermine the course of the epidemic for decades to come. At the end of 1997, over one million children around the world were estimated to be living with HIV and suffering the physical and psychologicalconsequences of infection. Of the estimated 16,000 new infections daily,about 1,600 are in children under the age of 15 years. Young people betweenthe ages of 10 and 24 account for more than 50 per cent of new post-infancyinfections worldwide. As well, this age group constitutes more than 30 percent of all people in the developing world, where the epidemic is concentrated.If HIV prevention in this huge population fails, developing countries will haveto face the staggering human and economic costs of vast numbers of adultAIDS cases. Increasingly, young people are being appreciated as a resource for changing the course of the epidemic. They are responsive to HIV preventionprogrammes and are effective promoters of HIV prevention action. Investing inHIV prevention among young people is likely to contribute significantly to amore sustainable response to HIV/AIDS. Several lessons have been learnedover the past years that can be applied to planning effective actions to focusmore on young people in the HIV epidemic. Priority actions to be considered in the light of situation and response analysis in various countries, and feedback from youth organizations and youngpeople, include: /G01 establishing or reviewing national policies to reduce the vulnerability of young people to HIV/AIDS and ensuring that their rights are respected,protected, and fulfilled /G01 promoting young people 's genuine participation in expanding national responses to HIV/AIDS /G01 supporting peer and youth groups in the community to contribute to local and national responses to HIV/AIDS /G01 mobilizing parents, policy-makers, media, and religious organizations to influence public opinion and policies with regard to HIV/AIDS and youngpeople /G01 improving the quality and coverage of school programmes that include HIV/AIDS and related issues /G01 expanding access to youth-friendly health services including HIV and STD prevention, testing and counselling, and care and support services /G01 ensuring care and support of young people living with HIV/AIDS/G02/G0B Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSTwo particular groups of children and young people will require a special emphasis: AIDS orphans and young people living with HIV/AIDS. UNAIDSestimates that, as of December 1998, the total number of AIDS orphans(defined as children having lost their mother or both parents to AIDS beforethe age of 15) since the start of the epidemic totalled at least 8.2 million. Inmany developing countries, extended family systems have traditionallyprovided support for orphans. However, AIDS, combined with other pressuressuch as migration, is pushing the extended family system to the breakingpoint in the worst-affected countries. Like older HIV-positive adults, children and young people living with HIV infection require increasing health care as their immune system weakens andtheir health declines. However, they may face special obstacles in exercisingtheir right to health. Young people may be too poor to buy care, or too afraidof disclosure by health providers who might not respect their confidentiality.The absence of youth-friendly services is an obstacle. In line with the UnitedNations Convention on the Rights of the Child, all children living withHIV/AIDS must have access to treatment, counselling, education, recreation,and social support, and must be protected against any form of discrimination.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G02/G02Botswana Tsa Banana Adolescent Reproductive Health Programme (Botswana) Starting Year : 1995 Main Topic Area : Children and young people Other Topic Areas : Reproductive health Contact Person : Dominique Meekers, Guy Stallworthy, : Population Services InternationalSocial Marketing and Communications for Health 1120 19th Street, NW, Suite 600Washington DC 20036USA Implementers Population Services International Funding USAID Objectives The Tsa Banana adolescent reproductive health programme was designed to: - identify, develop, and promote reproductive health information, products, and outlets that are youth-friendly - encourage young people to visit clinics, pharmacies, and youth centres for advice on how to avoid teen pregnancy and protect themselves againstHIV/AIDS - train retailers and clinic workers to respond to the special needs of their young clients. Background Premarital sexual activity is common among the Tswana, often before the age of 17, and it is common for both young men and women to have more thanone sex partner. Young people in Botswana believed that reproductive healthservices were not intended for adolescents, and many were intimidated byclinics and staff. Yet Botswana has a high and increasing incidence ofadolescent reproductive health problems, including pregnancy and infectionwith HIV and other STDs./G02/G03 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSBotswana Tsa Banana, which means \"for adolescents\" in Tswana, was launched to test the effects of a promotion campaign targeting young adults in the medium-sized town of Lobatse. Main Activities The one-year project was implemented in Lobatse from March 1995. It included the following: - a communications campaign- youth-oriented social marketing of condoms- community outreach through peer sales educators- development of adolescent-friendly outlets for distribution of condoms and information. Peer educators taught adolescents condom-negotiation skills, correct condom use, and ABC: Abstain, Be faithful, and Condomize. Condom demonstrationswere held to instruct adolescents about the correct use of condoms. Theprogramme also provided peer education sessions in primary and secondaryschools. In secondary schools, the education sessions targeted all studentsand addressed topics related to AIDS, HIV transmission, teen pregnancy, andcondoms. In primary schools, the education sessions targeted only those over13, and mainly provided information on puberty and encouraged abstinence. Outcomes Research showed that 68% of female and 71% of male adolescents had heard of the Tsa Banana programme. Most (59% of females and 64% ofmales) had been exposed to Tsa Banana promotional items such as T-shirts,stickers, and pamphlets. More than 20% had heard about or seen a TsaBanana condom demonstration. Some 41% of females adolescents and 33%of males were directly involved in Tsa Banana activities. Evaluation Findings Pre- and post-intervention surveys were conducted in both the intervention location (Lobatse) and a comparison location (Francistown) by Social ImpactAssessment and Policy Analysis Corporation (SIAPAC) Africa. Analysis isbased on the health belief model (HBM), which attributes changes inindividuals' health behaviour to their beliefs about 1) the severity of the healththreat, 2) their susceptibility to it, 3) the benefits/effectiveness of protectivemeasures, 4) the barriers/negative implications of taking protective action, and5) a trigger that leads individuals to act on these beliefs. All changes in health beliefs were statistically significant. Females in the follow-up survey were 0.6 times as likely as women in the baseline survey tobelieve that it is hard to convince a partner to use a condom. At the sametime, males were 2.2 times more likely to be shy about buying condoms in apublic place, and 1.8 times likelier to be shy about obtaining them from ahealth workers. After the intervention, males were 1.5 times more likely than before to believe that people use condoms to avoid sexual risks, and only 0.7 times as likely tobelieve it is hard to convince a partner to use a condom. Females were 2.7Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G02/G04Botswana times more likely than before the intervention to believe that AIDS cannot be cured, 3.4 times more likely to believe that people use condoms, 1.5 timesmore likely to believe people abstain from sex, and only 0.2 times as likely tobelieve that sex is good because it can lead to marriage. There were a number of changes, both desirable and undesirable, which took place in both the intervention and the control location and that were notattributable to the intervention. Desirable changes are that males are morelikely to believe that sexually active people are at risk of HIV/AIDS, thatpeople reduce risk by abstaining from sexual activity, and that many of theirfriends use condoms. They are less likely to believe that sex is good becauseit can lead to marriage. There were undesirable changes as well. Females inboth locations are more likely to feel shy about purchasing condoms in public,believe that women lose the respect of males if they initiate condom use, andbelieve that few of their friends use condoms. They are less likely to believethat people avoid casual and multiple partners to avoid risks. Among males,there is increased belief that sex is good because it enhances one's status. However, the study demonstrates that the programme had a positive impact on several adolescent health beliefs. Within eight months, the interventionresulted in significant increases in the beliefs that AIDS cannot be cured, thatpeople use condoms or abstain to protect themselves, and that it is easy toconvince a partner to use condoms. Lessons Learned Males and females differ both in their responses to the Tsa Banana campaign and in societal trends. Future interventions should be designed to allow forthese differences. Moreover, additional emphasis may be needed to counterundesirable changes. Growing awareness that condoms protect against the risks involved in having casual and/or multiple partners may simultaneously tend to stigmatizecondoms - through the associations with high-risk behaviour - even as it increases the perception of benefits that accrue from using them. Thisenhanced understanding of the complexity of the factors that affectprogramme impact will help programme managers improve ongoing as well asfuture AIDS prevention programmes.

Box 1042Asmara, Eritrea Implementers National Union of Eritrean Youth and Students (NUEYS) Funding UNFPA, Population Services International (PSI), UNICEF, and Family Planning Service Expansion and Technical Support Project (SEATS), a USNGO. Objectives The programme seeks to improve health for all young people 14 to 30 years of age by training volunteers in reproductive health and family planning so thatthey can establish peer education programmes in their schools and sharetheir knowledge with their peer group. Background In 1993, following a 30-year struggle, Eritrea become the most recent independent nation in Africa (Africa's 52nd nation). It faces many seriousproblems. Nearly a quarter of Eritrean women marry before they are 15 yearsold and many bear children before their bodies are fully developed. Totalfertility for the whole country is 6.1 children per woman (3.7 for the city ofAsmara). The large number of births, spaced very closely, contributes to bothmaternal and infant mortality. The contraceptive prevalence rate is only 26 percent in Asmara and 8 per cent for the country. As well, Eritrea suffers from anilliteracy rate of over 80 per cent, an acute shortage of schoolteachers andSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G02/G06Eritrea instructional materials and equipment, uneven distribution of educational resources, and the absence of vocational training opportunities. About 5,787cases of AIDS had been reported by the National AIDS Control Programme(NACP) of Eritrea by late 1998, and it is believed that HIV prevalence isgrowing rapidly, doubling every 18 months. The youth of Eritrea (aged 14 -24) account for approximately 30 -35 per cent of the total population. There are insufficient school places and jobs, leavingmany young people untrained and with few ways to contribute productively totheir society. It is estimated that 20,000 young people are in school and700,000 are out of school. In Eritrea, it has traditionally been difficult for young people to get information on sexual and health matters. The family is often unprepared to deal with theeducational, informational, and social needs of its children, and a traditionalEritrean family does not normally discuss sexual issues with children. Nor hasthe school system traditionally provided sex-related education. Similarly, thereare few other institutions that cater to the physical and psychological needs ofthe young. Consequently, the youth of Eritrea tend to be ignorant on issuesrelated to sexuality and adolescent/reproductive health. The National Union of Eritrean Youth and Students (NUEYS) is a national non-governmental organization whose goal is to advance education andimprove employment opportunities for youth. It has evolved into a strong,nationwide network, with a membership of over 138,000 young people, a paidstaff of 269 within 51 urban and rural offices and sub-offices, and an evenlarger volunteer workforce, about half of which are women. NUEYS has acooperative relationship with both local and foreign NGOs, UN agencies, andgovernment ministries, and has participated in the implementation of a broadrange of activities and projects throughout Eritrea, including four healthcentres. Main Activities Given the prevailing situation and indications of an increase in the problems of young people and their poor awareness about reproductive health andresponsible sexuality, NUEYS and the Planned Parenthood Association ofEritrea (PPAE) in 1994 designed a project of comprehensive reproductivehealth education and services. In recent years, HIV activities have taken on alarger profile in the overall effort. They include. - Regular sensitization seminars for high school students: These basically cover topics of population dynamics, anatomy and physiology of reproductiveorgans, what adolescence is, changes in adolescence, how pregnancyoccurs, methods to prevent pregnancy, and STDs with emphasis onHIV/AIDS. - Training for adolescent reproductive health counselling: The topics in the training courses on adolescent reproductive health include populationdynamics, pretest counselling procedures, the AIDS situation in Eritrea,adolescents ' and parents ' perceptions about pregnancy, psycho-dynamics of counselling, sexual maturation, gender and sex, methods to preventpregnancy, female genital mutilation, consequences of unprotectedintercourse (i.e., pregnancy, abortion, infection with STDs or HIV/AIDS)./G02/G07 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSEritrea - Peer education programme: The trained youth are encouraged to hold meetings with their peer groups in their schools, at NUEYS health centres,and at NUEYS rural and urban offices. - Workshop on how to involve men in family planning and introducing female condoms: Part of the messages given to men here is that using the femalecondoms would both facilitate family planning and prevent infecting partnerswith STDs including HIV/AIDS. - Condom distribution: Condoms are distributed through the centres to STD clients and others. They are also distributed in the various sites where healthorientation seminars are given and health training is done. - Provision of clinical STD case management and family planning services, reproductive health counselling, library and recreational services for youngpeople: These are the services that the youth-friendly centres provide toclients on a daily basis. In each of the services mentioned above there is anHIV/AIDS component. In the library and recreation centres for instance, thereare IEC materials and other health booklets that speak specifically aboutHIV/AIDS. Part of the recreation provided is video shows that include moviesthat are HIV/AIDS-specific. - Drama and film production: Several drama shows have been organized and shown to youth and the public, some only in Asmara and others throughoutthe country using a mobile drama group. These shows are alwaysaccompanied by the distribution of condoms and different campaign materials.NUEYS recently coproduced a film on HIV/AIDS and youth. Using languageyoung people understand, it deals with the current behaviours of andproblems facing Eritrean young people. This film was launched in thepresence of many collaborating NGO representatives, youth leaders, MOHofficials, and others and was broadcast on national TV on the World AIDS-Day Campaign launching day. - Radio and newspaper: NUEYS is using one of its three newspapers to publish HIV/AIDS and other reproductive health -related articles addressing questions from youth on social issues like dating, friendship, love and sex,school and peers, peer pressure, and so forth. The articles are publishedevery other week, with an overall goal of promoting healthy and safe sexualbehaviour in young people. As well, NUEYS, in agreement with the Ministry ofInformation, has national radio airtime every Saturday from 2 to 3 P.M., duringwhich youth issues are broadcast. Health messages are incorporated intothese radio programmes, presented in drama, poems, and other forms.NUEYS organized a two-hour live radio programme for the 1999 World AIDSDay activities. Outcomes A review of the cumulative achievements of the four health centres shows strong growth of services from 1996 to 1999. It is difficult to separate theHIV/AIDS component from other activities, but the following figures have beencollected. Note that the clients are people between the ages of 14 and 35, inAsmara and other towns in which the centres are found. They are servedSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G02/G08Eritrea regardless of their membership in the union and their sex, religion, ethnic group, or other characteristics.

Although free services maybe appropriate given the general levels of poverty, the fact remains thatNUEYS must find new sources of funding if services are to be enhanced, oreven sustained. Lessons Learned The programme illustrates the potential of a national, mass-based organization like NUEYS to participate in a major public health effort - in this case, to mobilize young people against HIV/AIDS and reach out to them withservices. The national union's size allows it to participate as a partner withgovernment ministries and major international NGOs, possibilities that wouldbe denied an organization with fewer members or a smaller geographiccoverage. An important lesson learned by NUEYS in all its activities is that different populations of young people must be reached in different ways. It is relativelystraightforward to bring HIV/AIDS information and activities to young people inschool, but the difficult situation of the country means that concentrating onlyon school-based activities would miss large numbers of potentialbeneficiaries. Therefore, the strategy of diversity - attacking the problem of HIV/AIDS and the lack of reproductive health knowledge from multipledirections and using various media - is the most effective way to reach all young people, including some of the most vulnerable such as those who areout of school but living in or near urban areas./G02/G09 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSNamibia Life Skills Programme: \"My Future Is My Choice\" (Namibia) Starting Year : 1997 Main Topic Area : Children and young people Other Topic Areas : Communications programming \u007f Reproductive health Contact Person : Mr. Rick OlsonProject Youth Health Development Programme (YHDP), through multisectoral committees, and the Ministries of Youth, Health, and Education Funding UNICEF, Sida, Irish Aid, World AIDS Foundation, UNICEF Committee of Germany Objectives The main objective is, by the year 2001, to provide life-skills education to 80 per cent of the country 's young people, aged 10 -18 years. The project is designed to: - inform them about sexual heath, pregnancy, STDs, alcohol and drug abuse, and HIV/AIDS to help them make positive decisions - improve communication skills between boys and girls, friends, and young people and their parents by providing them with information andcommunication or decision-making skills on sexual health. Background My Future Is My Choice (MFMC) is a programme that provides life-skills training specifically for HIV/AIDS prevention, teen pregnancy reduction, youthempowerment, and behaviour change among young people, as well asinformation on sex as a decision for two, alcohol and drug abuse, and rape.The programme uses a highly interactive approach to inform young peoplewhile allowing them to explore their feelings in a safe environment.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G02/G0ANamibia Main Activities My Future Is My Choice is a ten-session programme that aims to give young people the information and life skills they need to think and make choicesabout their future. This involvement in their own development allows them tothink for themselves and take responsibility for their future. In other words, theprogramme tries to give young people the courage, confidence, and skills tomake informed choices about how they behave. Young people who have completed secondary school receive ten days of training as MFMC facilitators. They then facilitate MFMC groups of 20 -22 young people who voluntarily sign up for the programme. The ten two-hoursessions are spread over three to five weeks and are held at schools afterregular classes or in the community for out-of-school youth. Young people, trained as master trainers, supervise the facilitators. The programme 's 622 facilitators and 45 master trainers are responsible to a regional or subregional YHDP committee, which includes young people. Eachfacilitator works through the MFMC training manual, which has six or sevenactivities each session. The opening and closing activities are short and ofteninclude a game. There are at least three 20 -25 minute participatory or skills- development activities each session. All participants have workbooks, with information from the session and space to take notes. Each session is evaluated by three participants. In the lastsession, each participant does a peer education action plan. In addition, eachschool has a contact teacher who provides some oversight of the facilitator'sactivities. Outcomes In 1997, approximately 7,500 young people went through the course, followed by 21,000 in 1998. In 1999, the manual was revised and made moreparticipatory and focused. Just over 20,000 young people went throughMFMC in 1999. The target for 2000 is a minimum of 40,000 young people toreceive 20 hours of peer-facilitated life-skills education on sexual andreproductive health. Evaluation Findings In 1998, a longitudinal study was done comparing the reported sexual behaviour of young people who went through MFMC with young people whohad not. Those who had gone through MFMC were delaying sexualintercourse longer and significant numbers were using condoms. Lessons Learned An important lesson learned is that building the \"ownership\" of the activity in the communities where it takes place is a key component of success. Buildingsuch ownership is not only a matter of good will and openness, but also oforganizational structure. This lesson was recognized fairly early on in the programme's life, with the result that MFMC was decentralized in 1999 to allow the regions to manageand monitor project implementation. This has been successful, with increased/G03/G0B Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSNamibia inclusion of young people in the management and supervision of the activities - as equal partners with the staff of the Youth, Health, and Education Ministries. This has been a learning experience for both the adult and youthcommittee members. One concrete application of this experience was that therevision of the training manual in 1999 involved young people and experts. Capacity development for partners is a long-term process, and skills still need to be strengthened in project management and monitoring and evaluation.Nonetheless, by listening more to the young people, the project partnersbelieve they have produced a training programme that more closely meets theneeds of its participants.

In many countries, community response preceded the official national response.It has proved essential to many components of a successful nationalresponse, most notably awareness, prevention, policy and legal changes,impact alleviation, advocacy, and family or community care and support. UNAIDS defines \"community \" in its widest and most inclusive sense: a community is a group of people who have something in common and will acttogether in their common interest. Many people belong to a number ofdifferent communities - the place they live, the people they work with, and their religious group, for example. A community becomes mobilized when a particular group of people becomes aware of a shared concern or common need, and decides together to takeaction in order to create shared benefits. A community's ability to act togethermay have existed for centuries, or it may be triggered in a very short time bysome urgent problem. In the past, community mobilization has usually meantinitiatives at a neighbourhood, village, or local district level. Today, however, the AIDS pandemic and modern communications technology have challenged traditional ideas of community. National and even globalcommunities have emerged, with shared concerns to prevent the spread ofthe virus, to care for those affected by HIV and AIDS, and to advocate forhealth and human rights. While the concept of community has been widened,the need to design culturally and epidemiologically specific responses to helpparticular groups of people has created a corresponding need to defineindividual communities more closely. In terms of HIV/AIDS, a mobilized community exhibits most or all of the following characteristics: /G01 Members are aware - in a detailed and realistic way - of their individual and collective vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. /G01 Members are motivated to do something about this vulnerability. /G01 Members have practical knowledge of the different options they can take to reduce their vulnerability. /G01 Members take action within their capability, applying their own strengths and investing their own resources, including money, labour, materials, orwhatever else they have to contribute. /G01 Members participate in decision-making on what actions to take, evaluate the results, and take responsibility for both success and failure. /G01 The community seeks outside assistance and cooperation when needed./G03/G03 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSStarting a community effort is generally much easier than sustaining it. Many community organizations and programmes have been at work for years, andcontinue today with the same enthusiasm. Others have withered and lost theirformer energy; some have disappeared. For national responses to beeffective, existing community initiatives must be reinforced, and new onesmust be nurtured as they establish themselves. This will require flexiblepartnership arrangements with governments and other forces in the campaignagainst HIV/AIDS, particularly in developing countries. A huge range of activities has been found effective in the field of community mobilization projects for HIV/AIDS. However, experience indicates that BestPractice in this field is distinguished by the following basic principles: /G01 Uphold the rights and dignity of people infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS. /G01 Ensure active participation by as broad and representative a group of community members as possible. /G01 Provide for equal partnership and mutual respect between the community and external facilitators. /G01 Build capacity and ensure sustainability. /G01 Build on the realities of living with HIV and AIDS while maintaining hope based on community collective action. /G01 Maximize use of community resources while identifying and using additional external resources as needed.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G03/G04C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Centre for Socio-Medical Assistance (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) Starting Year : 1991 Main Topic Area : Community mobilization Other Topic Areas : Palliative care \u007f Religion \u007f Resource mobilization Contact Person : Dr Marc Aguirre Phone: +225 41 80 83 Fax: +225 41 80 is an international, faith-based NGO. It works in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, the National AIDS Programme, andthe University Hospital (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire - CHU). Funding Financial support comes from a variety of sources including HOPE Worldwide, USA; agencies and institutions that fund specific ongoing projects (prison,youth, counselling); income-generating activities (card-making); person withHIV/AIDS participation ($2.50 per month); donations. Material support is also obtained through local donations by individuals and business, food and clothes drives. Finally, technical support and training through workshops and conference attendance assistance has come from international agencies such as USAID,UNICEF, UNAIDS, UNDP, and Coop \u00e9ration Fran \u00e7aise. Objectives The Centre for Socio-Medical Assistance began its work with the initial goals of: - promoting decentralized care for persons living with HIV/AIDS - providing accessible, affordable, and compassionate care - supporting and encouraging patients to live positively with HIV. Over time, its goals have expanded to include:- developing a comprehensive continuum of care for persons living with HIV/AIDS through referrals and \"care linking\" with other services orinstitutions/G03/G05 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSC\u00f4te d'Ivoire - integrating persons living with HIV/AIDS into care and prevention programmes - mobilizing community resources to develop and promote sustainable local action. Background The Centre for Socio-Medical Assistance (Centre d'assistance socio-m \u00e9dicale - CASM), an outpatient clinic for persons living with HIV/AIDS, opened its doors in February 1991. The motivation for this initiative came from volunteers(mainly from the Church of Christ) who were taking care of the sick and dyingat the Infectious Diseases Unit of the CHU de Treichville. It soon becameapparent that the vast majority of patients being admitted to the unit were HIV-positive, and that many were being abandoned, stigmatized, or neglected byfamily, friends, and medical personnel. After discharge, few had the means topay for ongoing treatment, and there was an enormous need to providepersons living with HIV/AIDS with compassionate psychosocial support. Persons living with HIV/AIDS often find that their family and community connections are shattered by the illness and the fear and stigma thataccompany it. The guiding principle of CASM has been to restore a sense ofsolidarity between PLWHA and their community. It emphasizes that the mostconstructive answer to improving the quality of life lies in home andcommunity care, and the participation of infected and affected family andcommunity members. Encouraging the direct involvement of persons livingwith HIV/AIDS in counselling, prevention, support, fund-raising, incomegeneration, and care are all activities that directly help the immediatesituation. Main Activities CASM's main activities are as follows. 1. Medical careCASM employs two full-time and two part-time doctors, a pharmacy assistant, and four project and support staff. It also has a four-bed capacity for thoserequiring IV treatments and monitoring. A nurse, who is openly HIV-positiveherself, also volunteers regularly at the centre. The centre follows, as far aspossible, treatment procedures outlined by the World Health Organization(WHO) in its AIDS Home Care Handbook as well as those adapted by local government. Most persons living with HIV/AIDS attending the centre areindigent and have little family financial support. Patients pay the equivalent of$2.50 per month for medical consultations and basic drugs, regardless of thenumber of consultations. These drugs include many of those found on theWHO essential drug list and are, for the most part, procured from the maingovernment pharmacy at near cost price. 2. ReferralsThe clinic acts as a referral centre for persons living with HIV/AIDS. Referrals come from:Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G03/G06C\u00f4te d'Ivoire - the nearby (main) infectious diseases hospital (CHU de Treichville) (the hospital, through an official agreement, offers the centre tariff reductions on allspecialist consultations, labs, and hospitalizations) - a voluntary testing and counselling centre (CIPS)- a hospice centre (OASIS) that offers free care and hospitalization to those patients in the terminal phase of their illness and/or those who requireprolonged convalescent care - AIDS NGOs, associations of persons living with HIV/AIDS, and volunteers that provide support and follow-up at a community level. It also takes a small proportion of referrals from the private sector and from health services in outlying regions. 3. CounsellingThe centre employs two counsellors (one full-time and one part-time) and one psychologist. Various counselling and support strategies/techniques (such asgroup counselling, video viewing, and picture codes) are used to promoteacceptance of seropositive status as well as positive living and copingstrategies. Counsellors from the centre also form part of a \"trainer of trainers \" group, which is regularly called upon by the National AIDS Programme,institutions, and agencies. (CASM has also conducted multicentre research onthe impact of counselling on persons living with HIV/AIDS.) 4. Home-based supportThe centre has a team of approximately 20 community agents who provide home-based support for persons living with HIV/AIDS from the centre. Duringthe home visits, agents assess living conditions, address psychosocial needs,and, when necessary, accompany ill persons with HIV/AIDS to the centre orto the nearest hospital. Community agents also spend one day a month at thecentre counselling those attending the clinic. All information obtained andneeds and services rendered are recorded after the visit to assure properfollow-up. Community coordinators interact regularly, and community agentsmeet once a month to discuss relevant cases, issues, problems, and ways toimprove the programme. 5. Support for persons living with HIV/AIDS In 1994, CASM facilitated the development of the area's first support group for persons living with HIV/AIDS, the Club des amis. Its goal was to provideopportunities for persons living with HIV/AIDS to share common experiences,hopes, and fears and to rebuild dignity, a sense of self-worth, hope, andfriendships. Daily, a core of club members supports clinic staff withcounselling and support issues, fulfilling their desired role as peer educatorsand counsellors. Club members are also actively involved in joint AIDSprevention programmes (including participating in the centre's theatre group,whose name, Kazenze, means \"staying together \"). The centre has also provided persons living with HIV/AIDS with nutritional, material, and financialassistance. With the support from the Lions Club, a local NGO called InitiativePlus, and a group of four to six volunteers, the centre provides a daily freebreakfast to all its clients. The breakfast table also serves as a safe place fordiscussion and interaction between persons living with HIV/AIDS./G03/G07 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSC\u00f4te d'Ivoire 6. Income generation Through various income-generating projects and donations, CASM has been able to provide small cash incentives to persons living with HIV/AIDS whohave requested financing of viable projects or who need urgent financialassistance. These have been given mainly to support indigent HIV-positivewomen and children. Patients are encouraged to participate in card-making,earning 20 per cent of the sale price of each card. 7. Support for orphansTogether with one of the associations of persons living with HIV/AIDS, the centre has been able to support a small number of orphaned children bykeeping them in school and providing them with basic support and provisions.The centre also holds an annual Christmas party for orphans and severelyaffected children. This event has been well supported by a wide range ofpartners. 8. AIDS prevention activitiesThe centre's prevention programmes have in recent years targeted four particularly vulnerable groups: women, young people, prisoners, underservedcommunities. Peer educators have been trained within most of these targetgroups. Group discussions, community conferences, slide shows, theatre,personal testimonies, and other strategies have been used to achieve thegreatest possible impact. Many of these interventions have been designed incollaboration with other NGOs and youth and sports associations, and haveincluded the participation of persons living with HIV/AIDS in their design andexecution. 9. Volunteer contributionsIn most of its activities, the centre benefits enormously from a large pool of volunteers. Many of the CASM staff first began working as volunteers.Volunteers come from AIDS NGOs and associations, religious groups,international institutions and agencies, and from concerned members of thecommunity. Volunteers support the centre in a number of ways and atdifferent levels. Within the centre, they provide counselling and support, helpwith the daily functioning of the centre (cleaning, typing, filing, and so on),cook and serve breakfast, make greeting cards for sale by the centre, anddecorate the centre in order to make it a pleasant and inviting place. Outsidein the community, the volunteers carry out home and hospital visits topatients; help with AIDS prevention campaigns, marches, and conferences;sell cards made at the centre; and carry out fund-raising and publicity. Thevolunteers, particularly those assisting within the clinic level, receive smallfinancial and material rewards as well as free medical services. Coordinators,who meet regularly with volunteers, organize volunteer activities at both theclinic and community level. Outcomes - On average, 25-30 new patients are referred to CASM every month. The ratio of men to women referred is now equal, a major change since the firstfew years when it was almost 4 to 1. The average age of those referred is 25. - The community agents make about 40 home visits to patients every month.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G03/G08C\u00f4te d'Ivoire - The Club des amis is now a fully fledged association in its own right (with over 300 members) and has itself facilitated the creation of three otherassociations for persons living with HIV/AIDS. - Prevention programmes have reached over 200,000 people over the past five years. Lessons Learned CASM's experience with resource mobilization provides some important lessons. Over the years, the centre has developed important local resourcesthat underpin its activities and allow it to meet many of its objectives. Themost notable of these are: - a large pool of committed volunteers- strong collaboration with associations of persons living with HIV/AIDS- formal links with other services and institutions that strengthen the care continuum available to patients. Developing such resources is essential for any project with CASM's goals and target population. Given the severity of the epidemic and the fragile economic condition of the area, the centre at the same time has learned the limitations of local resourcemobilization. Despite the development of local resources, the project is highlydependent on external funding, and lacks the resources to hire trainedmanagerial staff. It does not have sufficient funds to purchase all the basicdrugs it needs to meet patient demand. Project staff believe that untappedlocal resources exist that might be used to reduce its dependence on outsidedonations, but the centre has been unable to find entry to these resources.

Box 53376Nairobi, Kenya Implementers The organization in charge of the project is the Medical Mission Sisters Health Programme. Funding The main funding for the programme comes from Memisa Medicus Mundi (Netherlands)/Cordaid. Initial help with publicity materials was received fromUNICEF. The programme also receives funds from parish groups overseasand locally. Objectives The goal is to enable the people of Korogocho to cope with AIDS physically, socially, and psychologically by: - training community health workers to care for persons living with AIDS- providing a backup team of medical and social services professionals to enable this to happen. Background Korogocho, the slum in Kariobangi in which the programme is set, is 12 km east from the centre of Nairobi. It has a population of over 100,000 (recentunconfirmed statistics suggest it is now 130,000). Most people live in singleroom shanties made of plastic, tin, or mud. Sixty per cent of homes areheaded by women alone. Most residents have no land and are living assquatters in the slum. As there is little opportunity for work, most try to earn aliving by very small-scale trading, and by scavenging on the city dump, or byalcohol-brewing and survival prostitution. A survey conducted in two large neighbourhoods in the Korogocho slums showed that 32 per cent of the population was HIV-positive; 14 per cent ofSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G03/G0AKenya those infected had AIDS. Due to their poverty, some 22 per cent had never sought medical attention. The Community Health Programme was begun in 1986 by Sister Gill Horsefield, MMS, and commenced its AIDS-related activities in 1989 -90. Main Activities The programme delivers many of its services through the volunteer work of community health workers (CHWs), who are all from Korogocho itself. TheCHWs are supervised and supported by a professional staff of five nurses,two counsellors, a social worker who visits mothers with AIDS and helps themplan for the future of their children, and a pastoral worker who serves patients'spiritual needs. There is also a diagnostic laboratory for TB in the Deanery ofthe local Catholic church. The programme has six main activities:1. Care for the sickThe programme recognizes and attempts to build on the fact that most of the care that persons living with HIV/AIDS will receive, realistically, will beprovided by relatives (not just adults, but frequently by children) and friends ofthe patients at their own homes. Therefore, the programme improves andsupports this existing care resource through voluntary community healthworkers. The workers provide friendship and moral support, bring medicines,and teach home-nursing skills to the patients ' relatives and friends. Where necessary, workers bring food during their visits - either a cooked meal provided once a day, or dry food to be cooked for the patient by familymembers. If food is provided, it is for the whole family rather than just thepatient, a necessity given the difficult circumstances in which most AIDS-affected families live. 2. Referral systemThe community health workers live in the slum, and they are each responsible for a small area. When someone in the area is sick, the CHW will be told byneighbours. She will visit the person to determine the seriousness of theillness. If it is a minor sickness, she will advise on home treatment or perhapsrecommend a visit to the dispensary. If the sickness is serious, or the patientappears to have symptoms of AIDS, she will call the nurse, who will visit thepatient with her and make a diagnosis. If the patient has the symptoms ofAIDS, he or she will be registered in the programme, and the health workerwill then visit regularly, and report every week to the nurse on the patient 's condition. Some patients require additional care in between reporting times. Insuch cases, CHWs can contact the nurse in the morning when she arrives tovisit the area. Once diagnosed as having AIDS, patients are prescribed theirmedicines by the nurses, and the medicines are delivered by the CHWs. 3. Crisis care for persons with AIDSAn aim of the programme is to help patients to stay at home until they die. When care at home is beyond the abilities of relatives or friends, there is asmall hospice, run by the volunteer health workers, where patients can belooked after following a major downturn in their health. The hospice has fourbeds but usually has only one or two patients at a time./G04/G0B Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSKenya 4. Crisis care for children The programme provides medical care to children living with HIV, but also runs a Child Crisis Centre where children can stay temporarily when a motheris too sick to cope, or when a mother dies suddenly. This need has emergedas adult mortality due to AIDS makes it increasingly difficult to find familymembers to care for orphans. The Crisis Centre is also a safe haven wherechildren who are caring for sick parents come to learn, and where they canalways come to get advice, moral support, and emotional support. 5. Children's programmeChild-headed households are becoming more common. Even when a very small child is sent to grandparents, the eldest child usually remains in thefamily home with the responsibility for caring for the other children. Thechildren's programme was created for children who are healthy themselves but who will in the future be orphaned. They are invited to join in order toprepare for life without parents. They learn how to care for their sick parentsand also how to bring up their younger brothers and sisters. While learning,they share a great deal together, and so form supportive groups that, it ishoped, will help them in the future. 6. Recruitment and training of community health workersThe community health workers are chosen from the small Christian communities of the neighbourhood. These communities are mutuallysupportive groups who expect all their members to perform some sort ofservice within the community. Huduma ya Afya (Service for Health) is one ofthe services for which members can volunteer. They are trained incommunity-based health care at Korogocho village school, where they haveweekly classes for about five to six months. After working for a year, theyreceive a badge and a certificate. The CHWs are regarded with great respectin the neighbourhood, and are regarded as peers by the professional staff,who support them and help them to increase their knowledge. Some of thehealth workers are trained as counsellors; most of them have supplies ofmedicines for treatment of symptoms, and some have supplies of antibiotics.Those who work in the hospice have received training in psychological andpastoral care of the dying. The CHWs are involved in all decision-making about the development of the programme. Their strong Christian motivation is reinforced by the gratitudeand support with which they are treated by both patients and professionalstaff. Some of the CHWs have been working for 12 years and feel that, inspite of receiving no financial reward, they have gained a great deal in termsof increased abilities and confidence. Outcomes The programme's current patient load is 787 persons, with a cumulative total of 3,746 persons served since 1990. There were 537 new patients in 1999. In 1998, 68 volunteer health workers provided medical care and moral support to 1,880 persons living with AIDS, including 172 babies and children.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G04/G02Kenya Evaluation Findings Analysis of the programme budget for approximately 2,000 patients found an expenditure of $13.40 per patient per year (this sum includes the cost ofmedicines, staff salaries, transport, running a car, and administration). Of this,$2.20 represents the cost of medicine per patient per year. The cost oftraining per community health worker was calculated to be $7.00. Lessons Learned The experience in Kariobangi illustrates that a programme built largely on volunteers can make a significant difference in the lives of people living withHIV/AIDS in a very poor community. Three conditions appear to account formuch of the programme's success: - the energy and dedication of the volunteers, most of them highly motivated by religious faith, and the locally appropriate manner in which they arerecruited (i.e., the fact that recruitment is based on the respect that thecommunity holds for the candidates) - support and supervision provided by a professional staff- a web of local partnerships, including nearby health institutions and other NGOs working in the area. At the same time, the programme's experience also illustrates the limitations imposed by lack of local resources. The programme is highly dependent onexternal financing. Without it there would be no administrative budget, nosalaries for professional staff, and little money for medical supplies. Lessons have also been learned about the difficulty of dealing with AIDS in a culture where there remains considerable stigma attached to the disease(although there appears to be somewhat more openness about the subjectthan even a few years ago). A staff member comments, \"Often people will talkabout 'this sickness ' and everyone knows what they are talking about, but they don't actually call it AIDS. All the professional staff know the HIV status of all the patients, but keep the information confidential. The community healthworkers can only know a patient 's status if the patient herself/himself shares it with them. Nonetheless, most community health workers have a very goodknowledge of the signs and symptoms of AIDS, and are fully aware of anygiven patient's situation.\" An important problem raised by continuing stigma is that of informing children about their parents' serostatus. Community health workers have been trying topersuade HIV-positive parents to share this knowledge with their children, butso far with little success. Very often the children know, or at least suspect, andthe workers feel strongly that if the truth of the situation could be discussedopenly within families, it would be easier for the children. However,confidentiality forbids this without the parents' consent./G04/G03 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDS Health system personnel and training The knowledge of health care workers (HCWs) about HIV/AIDS varies from place to place, and in many cases is incomplete. Because the epidemic isrelatively recent, many HCWs have received little training on HIV/AIDS.Unless in-service training is offered, there is no opportunity to developknowledge or skills in this area of work. Nevertheless, most HCWs - nurses, midwives, doctors, dentists, and paramedical personnel - will at some point encounter people living with HIV/AIDS, and may be involved in their care. To do so, they will need newskills and increased knowledge. As well, support staff need to learn aboutHIV/AIDS if they are to be effective in their work, become educators forhealth, and protect themselves from harm. A planned programme of education in HIV/AIDS can be a cost-effective investment in recruitment and retention of the health care workforce forseveral important reasons. First, enhanced knowledge and skills lead toimproved patient care, in both prevention and treatment. Second, greaterknowledge will help HCWs to protect themselves from infection, bothprofessionally and personally. Third, there is growing evidence that improvedknowledge of HIV/AIDS positively affects attitudes to caring for people livingwith HIV/AIDS and reduces levels of discrimination towards them. Educational methods, as well as content, can significantly influence the outcomes of programmes. For example, guided learning based on experienceis more effective in both imparting knowledge and changing attitudes than is adidactic, information-giving approach. It is also important to note that traininghas the potential for capacity-building, as more HCWs become knowledgeableenough to become teachers themselves, provided that they are taught to haveand use those skills during their training. Recent experience in various parts of the world suggests the following among the many lessons learned about HIV-related training and awareness for healthcare personnel: /G01 While health managers and workers often feel in danger of being overwhelmed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic and have neither time norresources for training, this view is short-sighted. Training can actuallystrengthen capacity in the health sector, if it is planned as an integral partof health system development. /G01 Training programmes in many countries have not only enhanced the knowledge and skills of HCWs, but have also changed their attitudestowards working with people with HIV/AIDS. In some cases, increasedknowledge corrects misconceptions, and in that way can change attitudes.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G04/G04/G01 HCWs who are HIV-positive can continue to be valuable members of staff, provided they are offered support, and do not fear discrimination from theircoworkers. Training can correct misconceptions about risk of infection, andcan help to change attitudes too. (At the same time, HIV-positive HCWsneed to be protected from opportunistic infections, especially from TB, andboth managers and colleagues must be empowered to do this.) /G01 HCWs at all levels should be taught counselling skills with HIV/AIDS patients, especially in relation to testing. Preparing new students in all health sciences to care for people with HIV/AIDS is, of course, essential and will, in the longer term, build thecapacity of the health services. As well, there is a continuing need forresearch into the effects of education on all aspects of caring for people livingwith HIV/AIDS, and on health workers themselves, and therefore evaluation isa vital component of any training programme./G04/G05 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSUganda Partnership for Home-Based Care in Rural Areas (Uganda) Starting Year : 1993 Main Topic Area : Health system personnel and training Other Topic Areas : Reproductive health \u007f NGOs and networks \u007f Community mobilization Contact Person : Sophie +254-2-224154E-mail: Implementers Family Life Education Programme (FLEP), a community-based organization initiated by the Busoga Diocese in the mid-1980s, provides family planningand other reproductive health services for rural communities in Uganda. Pathfinder International is a US-based NGO that works to improve the quality of and accessibility to family planning and related reproductive health servicesin developing countries. It has worked with FLEP for many years, primarilyproviding training services. The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) grew out of Africa's first support group for persons living with or affected by HIV/AIDS, and since 1987 hasexpanded to provide a wide range of related services. Funding Funding has been provided by Pathfinder International and USAID, and indirectly by a number of donors that support TASO. Objectives The goal of the partnership is to improve the quality and accessibility of HIV/AIDS care and prevention services in rural communities that have fewformal health services. The partnership aims to reach especially vulnerablegroups (women, young and adolescent children, orphans, and very poorpeople). This is to be done by:Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G04/G06Uganda - delivering services such as counselling, reproductive health care and family planning, and medical care and social support - buiding the capacity of other organizations, communities, institutions, and individuals already in the communities to provide HIV/AIDS services - networking in order to increase information exchange and solidarity among HIV/AIDS organizations, communities, institutions, and individuals - AIDS advocacy at the local and national levels. Background When the Family Life Education Programme was formed, civil war in the 1980s had destroyed much of Uganda 's rural infrastructure, leading to widespread poverty and few social services. FLEP was created to providebasic curative health care, family planning, and health education to the war-torn communities of the Busoga Diocese. FLEP was the first community-based organization to provide family planning and other reproductive healthservices for rural communities in Uganda. With USAID and Pathfinder International funding training as well as technical and other kinds of assistance, FLEP has conducted extensive information andeducation campaigns and has established 46 primary health care clinics.FLEP trained medical practitioners to staff the clinics, and also trained manyvillage health workers and village health leaders. As a result of thisexperience, FLEP developed training expertise and is now providing trainingand technical assistance to other reproductive health and family planningorganizations in Uganda. In 1993, communities began to demand AIDS-related services from village health workers, who did not have any training about the HIV virus and itsimpact. For this reason, Uganda's oldest and largest AIDS support group, theAIDS Support Organization (TASO), was requested to train village healthworkers, nurses, and FLEP supervisors in HIV/AIDS education and basicHIV/AIDS counselling. The context in which this partnership operates is extremely serious. The AIDS epidemic is confronting Uganda with demands that are far beyond thecapacity of its formal health care system, particularly in the rural areas servedby FLEP. Hospitals are overcrowded with AIDS patients, most of whom areeventually discharged to their homes in a state of hopelessness, to be caredfor by untrained relatives. Simultaneously, village health workers areoverwhelmed by the needs of persons with HIV/AIDS and their families,whose demands they must place alongside their usual reproductive healthand family planning services workload. At the same time, most AIDS-specificservices are concentrated in the country's urban areas. Main Activities The Partnership for Home-Based Care has two major sets of activities. One is training and capacity-building; such activities are fairly easily described interms of tasks and outputs. The other, which can be termed system capacity-building, includes such work as advocacy, negotiation, institutional reform,and networking. Its outputs are difficult to describe, but are essential tosupport training and capacity-building./G04/G07 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSUganda 1. Training The partnership works to improve and expand the skills of FLEP village health workers, nurses, and supervisors in rural communities. Training is aimed atensuring that persons living with HIV/AIDS are provided with a \"package ofcare services provided to a person living with HIV/AIDS at home by differentcare providers who may be clinic-based, health unit based, village-based,family or home-based.\" The components of the package are: medical care,both nursing and clinical; support education; sanitation. TASO and Pathfinder International therefore provide FLEP village health workers with the training to: (a) assess patients ' and families' needs (b) provide some of the package of services themselves, particularly counselling and some basic forms of medical care (c) train persons living with HIV/AIDS to provide self-care appropriate to their situation (d) train family members and friends of persons living with HIV/AIDS to be home-based caregivers, and thereby meet the patients ' day-to-day care needs (making them comfortable, ensuring better nutrition and hygiene,changing dressings, administering simple medications, keeping their spiritsup) (e) work with the local hospital and with doctors, counsellors, spiritual leaders, and social workers. This includes knowing the capacities of these otherservice-providers and making referrals as necessary. 2. System capacity-building The project recognizes that HIV/AIDS care is delivered at four levels, which frequently work independently, in ignorance, or in distrust of each other: - clinic-based service providers (doctors, nurses, counsellors)- community-based service providers (village health workers or AIDS community workers) - home-based caregivers (relatives or friends)- self-care by persons living with HIV/AIDS.The partnership aims to help build bridges between the different levels, making their efforts consistent and conscious of the efforts of others, andimproving the quality of care provided by each. This in turn improves theentire system of health care available in rural communities. This systemcapacity-building is done through meetings and workshops to plan,implement, or evaluate activities, negotiate financing, and examine andimprove training curricula. Advocacy is another important part of this activityset, and is carried out both at the local level (i.e., with local government andinstitutions), to ensure cooperation with the activities of village health workers,and at the provincial or national level with appropriate authorities such as theMinistry of Health.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G04/G08Uganda Outcomes To date, about 2,240 village health workers have been trained in 56 rural communities to provide AIDS-related services in addition to their other duties.Furthermore 160 counsellors for 16 other organizations have been trained toprovide AIDS services in districts without TASO centres. Through FLEP, thepartnership now provides care to an estimated 16,000 clients every year. Lessons Learned Perhaps the most important lesson learned is the significant potential benefit of cooperation between existing services, each contributing its own expertiseand practical experience, and the feasibility of doing so without creating newlevels of bureaucracy. The latter is particularly important in a resource-poorsetting. All three partners have been strengthened, but the real benefits arefelt by rural communities and people living with HIV/AIDS, who wouldotherwise have fewer, lower-quality AIDS-related services. As regards consistent quality of care, an important lesson is that regular refresher courses and frequent motivational interaction with supportivesupervisors help maintain enthusiasm and promote a greater level ofknowledge. Another important lesson is that morale-building and motivation must be given serious thought. Due to the gravity of the AIDS crisis and the tough economicsituation in these communities, the all-important human factor underpinningthese services is fragile. The demands on and local expectations for thevillage health workers are overwhelming, and it is a major concern of thepartners to acknowledge and help with the despair frequently faced by thesepeople who work most closely and most regularly with the patients. In order toreward and motivate village workers, FLEP began by giving them a bicycleevery three years and a bar of soap. The bar of soap was changed into amonthly allowance equivalent to the cost of soap, and this was eventuallyincreased to an equivalent of $10 a month. Other motivations included givingthem an annual allowance for bicycle spare parts, and acknowledging themwith a uniform.

A local response to HIV/AIDS means the involvement of people where they live - in their homes, their neighbourhoods, and their workplaces. Such a response aims to enable local communities to acquire what may be termed\"AIDS competence.\" This means that people should become skilled in dealingwith AIDS and, in particular, they should be properly informed about theepidemic; be able to assess accurately the factors that may put thempersonally, or their communities, at risk of infection; and act so as to reduceand mitigate the impact of those risks. The end goal of the process is to reduce HIV transmission and to enable those living with HIV/AIDS, as well as those affected, to enjoy an improvedquality of life. Since there are limits to what people can do on their own, localpartnerships can help improve the effectiveness of local responses. Suchpartnerships bring together key social groups, service providers, andfacilitators: /G01 Key social groups are those whose members have a particularly important role to play in HIV prevention and care activities, whether because they are athigh risk of infection (vulnerable groups) or for other reasons. Examplesinclude young people (particularly those out of school or unemployed), peopleliving with HIV/AIDS, migrants, and members of specific occupational groups,such as sex workers, soldiers, and truck drivers. /G01 Service providers may include government bodies (including local government), NGOs, community-based groups, businesses, or religiousgroups who furnish information, resources, or specific services. /G01 Facilitators stimulate interaction between the various partners in local response, helping them become more competent, make choices and setpriorities, command greater resources, or articulate their views. Experience documented in a range of countries suggests that successful local responses employ at least some (and usually many) of the following steps: /G01 Creating AIDS competence. Enabling people to assess accurately the factors that may put them or their communities at risk of infection, and to act toreduce those risks, requires a conducive political environment along with anaccessible range of interventions, activities, and services. /G01 Developing, by consensus, a national strategy on HIV/AIDS, based on local responses. Key elements in developing such a strategy includedecentralization of interventions to the most appropriate planning unit close tothe communities; multisectoral and participatory approaches; partnershipsSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G04/G0Afrom a range of social, cultural, and religious groups, with clearly defined tasks for the various partners. /G01 Appointing a national facilitator for local responses to HIV/AIDS. The facilitator's main task is to encourage feedback from lessons stemming fromactivities at the local level and to set up ways to exchange experiencesamong communities, sectors, and policy-makers. /G01 Establishing, at district level, a local responses support team responsible for expanding partnerships, finding new resources, and documenting andbuilding on the experiences of community projects. The team should have themoral support of local communities and include people such as districtofficials; religious and traditional leaders; representatives of NGOs,community-based organizations, and the private sector; and people livingwith HIV/AIDS. The local responses support team can strongly facilitate thelocal response by: - identifying key social groups who may be at particular risk of HIV infection, and whose AIDS competence it is especially urgent to build or reinforce - starting a feedback process to collect various lessons from around the district and using these to help local partners adjust the criteria for determining AIDScompetence and the means by which it can be achieved - encouraging sectoral reforms. In each sector, units should review - with regard to HIV/AIDS - the amount and quality of the services they are providing, their internal organizational structures, their interaction with others, and the planningand development of their human resources. The implementation of sectoralreforms is intended to create a suitable environment in which AIDS competencecan flourish. Note that the sequence in which these steps are performed is not critical. Depending on local circumstances, any of the steps can be the starting point./G05/G0B Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSBurkina Faso Gaoua District AIDS Initiative (Burkina Faso) Starting Year : 1997 Main Topic Area : Local responses Other Topic Areas : Resource mobilization \u007f NGOs and networks Contact Person : Kekoura KouroumaCPA Burkina Faso Phone: +226 31 Implementers The Gaoua District AIDS Initiative includes partners at the local, national, and international levels. The main original implementers identified in 1997 werethe local partners under the Ministry of Health (MOH) supported by thepolitical structures (local government, pr \u00e9fectures, Gaoua mayors, administrative delegates), the local radio, and some involvement of theMinistry of Education. In the voluntary and private sector, some NGOs (PlanInternational Burkina), associations (Association pour les femmes de Gaoua(APFG), Association pour les jeunes, Association des femmes chr \u00e9tiennes), and other groups (Union des transporteurs, Marketing social descondoms/PROMACO) were active. Since then they have been joined by a larger number of partners (see Outcomes). Funding Funding was originally from the MOH, with help from the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and Plan International, the latter operating in a fewcommunities. These funders have been joined over the past two years by theWorld Bank, UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNDP, and WHO. Some medicines are beingcontributed by the national Projet population et lutte contre le SIDA (PPLS/World Bank).Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G05/G02Burkina Faso Objectives Operational objectives of the Gaoua District AIDS Initiative were to: - carry out a situation assessment permitting a coordinated local-level response to HIV/AIDS in the district - bring together all sectors that could contribute to or benefit from the response - create a strategic plan for the response- implement the plan.On 1 December 1999, the Local Committee on HIV/AIDS (which is in itself one of the outputs of the initiative) created its own definition of the Gaouavision, which contains the following goals: - a change in individual sexual behaviour- a reduction in the stigma against people living with AIDS- a spontaneous willingness to come forward to be tested for HIV- an improvement in the quality of hospital care- an increased mobilization of people against HIV/AIDS- a reduction or stability in the rate of prevalence of HIV. Background Gaoua District in Burkina Faso's Poni province is moving ahead with implementation of support for local HIV/AIDS responses, having obtainedauthority to mobilize locally and disburse funds. Before the initiative began,AIDS was the responsibility of the health sector alone. In 1997, GTZ,UNAIDS, WHO, and the MOH began a study of how to expand the response. Main Activities While the operational activities of the initiative are similar to those found in many local responses to HIV/AIDS around the world (healthpromotion/information, education, and communication (IEC) activities, socialmarketing of condoms, testing and counselling facilities, etc.), it is the processby which the initiative was conceived, planned, and implemented that mayprovide the most useful lessons learned. The main points and timetable of thisprocess are as follows: - May 1997: situation analysis regarding local socioeconomic situation, social/behavioural determinants of the epidemic, social attitudes towards andknowledge of HIV/AIDS, access to health care, and the institutionalenvironment - March 1998: three-day pre-planning workshop to create consensus among partners - 1998: field studies in Gaoua, Kampti, Batie, and analysis regarding care and counselling needs; development oflessons learned from this research - September 1998: preliminary report - November 1998: four-day workshop to prioritize determinants needing to be addressed; assignment of domains of action to different sectors, based on/G05/G03 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSBurkina Faso these priorities; design of a planning team to propose a strategic plan and specific assignment of activities - December 1998: five-day meeting of the planning team to created detailed proposals for sectoral responsibilities and actions - December 1998: four-day workshop at which the proposals of the planning team were debated, directing principles for the initiative were adopted,consensus was obtained on sectoral objectives and strategies, and acoordinating procedure was adopted - January 1999: two-day workshop to finalize the strategic plan and its budget- January -April 1999: detailed planning by partners on their individual contributions to the initiative, done according to the framework of the strategicplan - 25 June: meeting of international partners for mobilization of financial resources - 1 July 1999: official date for implementation of the initiative- January 2000: first review of activities (internal evaluation, with recommendations for modifications where necessary). It is important to note that one agency (in this case, UNAIDS) has provided technical support to these activities throughout the local responses. Inaddition to secretariat functions and transportation, the support was providedin the form of: 1. consultations and coordination of activities2. documentation of processes and reforms at the district and national levels3. running meetings, seminars, and workshops for sharing lessons learned4. production of study papers.A country broker was hired to facilitate the local response process, articulate lessons learned from action, and ensure global dissemination of the lessonslearned. Outcomes At the local level, the initiative has engaged the participation of a wide variety of sectors, institutions, and groups. They include: - religious associations such as Catholic, Muslim, and Protestant lay women's groups - women's groups such as development associations (APFG), women educators (Association des m \u00e8res \u00e9ducatrices), soldiers' wives, Foyer Biboo Yir (Promotion de la jeune fille et pr \u00e9vention du SIDA) - young people's groups such as l 'Association pour la promotion anti-SIDA et planification (APASP), the theatre troupe Pale Nani, and the Sabougnoumaorchestra - the public service sector including different regional directorates (i.e., Direction r \u00e9gionale de la sant \u00e9 (DRS), l'Equipe cadre du district (ECD), and others (DRASF, DRERA, DRJS)), and the Regional Hospital (CHR), the army(22eme Ric), high schools and colleges, the public school inspectorate, andthe detention centre - local divisions of the NGO Plan international Burkinab \u00e9 (PIB).Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G05/G04Burkina Faso National-level participants include the Programme national de lutte contre le SIDA, the PPLS, and the Muraz Centre in Bobo-Dioulasso. Finally,international participants include an international NGO (Plan internationalBurkinab\u00e9/PIB) and bilateral (Coop \u00e9ration Fran \u00e7aise, GTZ) as well as international agencies (UNAIDS UNDP, UNFPA, WHO, and the World Bank). As regards external resource mobilization, Gaoua District mobilized US$ 200,000 (US$ 1 per inhabitant) from various bilateral sources to implementthe district level work plan from 1999 on. Within the country, the initiative has had an impact on higher levels of government. At the national level, Burkina Faso's Ministry of Health hasdecided to extend support to local responses to HIV/AIDS in 11 districts (oneper province) by mid-2000. Poni Province's High Commissioner hasestablished and chairs a provincial multisectoral AIDS control committee.Finally, 45 high commissioners and 44 mayors of Burkina Faso met in 1999 toshare experiences on the implementation of an expanded response to AIDS,using Gaoua District as a concrete example of what can be done. Evaluation Findings Preliminary review of the initiative reveals several indicators of impact. Journalistic interviews indicate that considerable enthusiasm and awarenesshave been generated among the local population for the general response toAIDS and that this awareness has extended to medical staff, health and othergovernmental authorities, and civil associations. Although numbers of peoplecoming forward for voluntary testing have not risen, awareness that theservice exists has become widespread and may yet translate into increasednumbers. While there has been some slowness in disbursement of promisedfunds, the majority of planned activities have received their funding andcommenced operation. Most activities have been in the town of Gaoua itself,with less activity (except for radio programming) reaching the more remoteareas of the district. The review also notes weaknesses in the intiative, including a lack of precision in job descriptions for Technical Committee members and a lack ofinformation exchange between the Technical Committee and the provincialAIDS Control Committee. Lessons Learned A major lesson that has been learned from the Gaoua experience (and that has been learned in countless other projects in other places) is theimportance of situation analysis tailored to HIV/AIDS questions, particularlyusing existing action-oriented research techniques. This research provides asolid underpinning to all activities, as well as answering many of the questionsthat external donors or technical partners may have before they will commit tosupporting such an initiative. If properly communicated, research findings cancontribute greatly to an entire community's AIDS competence by acquaintingthem with the reality of their situation - a key step towards taking action. A second lesson learned is that it is necessary for the process to be locally owned and driven and to have a time span of two to three years to develop./G05/G05 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSBurkina Faso Finally, the establishment of an official body (in this case, the Technical Committee) is of cardinal importance to take responsibility for consensus-builiding and for coordinating and planning the local response at the districtlevel. This group fulfills an essential role by identifying and bringing in newpartners, finding new resources, and documenting the progress of theinitiative. It is essential that the team have the moral support of localcommunities. Membership may be drawn from many sources, but shouldprobably include district officials; religious and traditional leaders;representatives of NGOs, community-based organizations, and the privatesector; and people living with HIV/AIDS.

EQUITY is a seven-year, $50-million USAID-funded project created to supportthe South African government in providing integrated public health careprojects to all South Africans. The project reports to the Eastern CapeDepartment of Health (ECDOH) and the South African Ministry of Health(MOH); Phase One of the project (1997 -2000) focuses on Eastern Cape. - The Employment Bureau of Africa (TEBA), whose major function was formerly to ensure an adequate supply of \"economical \" labour to the mining industry, has significantly refocused its activities in the new South Africansociety. TEBA will support Bambisanani by serving as a referral and supportsource (with a focus on repatriated migrant workers) and as a link with themining companies. In addition TEBA will assume the leadership role in thesupport group and income-generating element of the project. - The Mineworkers Development Agency (MDA) will support the job-creation and income-generating aspects of the project. MDA is the development wingof the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). - The gold mining companies have agreed to support home-based care services with resources (such as home-based care packs). There is a growingawareness of the need to broaden their commitment into the sphere of care inthe areas from which their mineworkers are drawn. - The Planned Parenthood Association of South Africa -Eastern Cape (PPASA-EC) will oversee and run the community capacity-building and thechildren in distress (CINDI) components of the project./G05/G07 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSSouth Africa - Hospice (Transkei and South Coast) is an international NGO providing palliative and terminal care. It will oversee and run the home-based careelement of the project, including the provision of training for care supporters. Funding Seed funding for the first two years is provided mainly by Bristol-Myers Squibb from their Secure the Future initiative, from Goldfields of South Africa, Ltd,and from the EQUITY Project. Objectives The goal of Bambisanani is to enable selected communities in the Eastern Cape's Region E to provide comprehensive care that will contribute to theimproved quality of life of persons living with HIV/AIDS, their families, and thecommunities in which they live. (Comprehensive care, as the term is used bythe project, encompasses not only the physical needs of the patient but alsospiritual, emotional, nutritional, and social needs.) In more concrete terms, Bambisanani aims to provide an organizational framework that can, cost-effectively and without introducing a newbureaucratic structure: - coordinate available services with government, businesses, NGOs, health care workers, and volunteers - establish adequate training for social service providers and home-based services - ensure that the special needs and concerns of groups such as persons living with HIV/AIDS, women, and children are attended to. Background Region E, part of the former homeland known as the Transkei, comprises four districts and has an area of over 17,043 sq. km. The population of Region E isbetween 1.2 and 1.3 million. Although only 2 per cent live in urban settings,the population density is high, 70 persons per square kilometre. In Region E, access to all health and social services is severely limited. There is 1 doctor for 16,592 people and the lowest ratio of nursing staff in thecountry (less than 1 per 1,000). The infant mortality rate of 58.2 per 1,000births and the life expectancy of 59.5 years are, respectively, the highest andlowest in the country. Over 40 per cent of all South African migrant workers working in the gold mines come from the Eastern Cape, and almost all the migrant cane-cuttersworking in the sugar industry come from Region E. According to thedemographic profile of Region E, there are many children and few old peopleexcept grandmothers. The absence of adult men is striking. In the age groupfrom 20 to 24 years, there are 50 per cent more women than men. Thedislocation of workers' family lives by the migrant labour system, inheritedfrom apartheid, creates a unique obstacle to containing the AIDS epidemic,and to establishing family care and support for AIDS patients. Figures from the end of 1998 show that the HIV prevalence rate among antenatal clients for Eastern Cape Province as a whole was 15.9 per cent,Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G05/G08South Africa 40 times what it was in 1990, with a 26 per cent increase from 1997. The figure for Region E was 21.5 per cent. The number of persons estimated to beHIV-positive in Region E was 69,392 (44,948 adult females, 22,207 adultmales, and 2,237 infants). TB is a major problem, and is the leading cause ofdeath in HIV-positive persons. In Region E only 17 per cent of clientscomplete their six-month TB treatment. More than 70 per cent of the hospital beds in Region E are occupied by patients with HIV (with or without associated TB). All the hospitals report beingover-burdened yet admit that there are no services available to support thedischarge of patients with chronic or terminal conditions into the care of theirfamilies and communities. Main Activities The project is based on the approach that decentralization (bringing decision- making and administration down to the local rather than national or provinciallevel) and integration (through partnership of existing players, each doingwhat they do best and avoiding competition or duplication) of all HIV/AIDSservices offer the best chance of sustainability as well as cost-effectiveness. In November 1999, under the auspices of the EQUITY Project, a consultative meeting was attended by representatives of all the potential partners inRegion E. The intent was to consolidate their experiences regardingHIV/AIDS, TB, the care and support of children in distress, and repatriatedworkers. To implement a thorough plan, they had to analyse potential partnersand develop guidelines for the partnership, keeping the plan within reasonablyobtainable parameters. A clear articulation of immediate needs became thestarting point of this project, summarized under four broad activity categories. 1. Community capacity-building In order to create an environment conducive to home-based care and support for children in distress, there is an urgent need for capacity-building among abroad base of constituencies (e.g., community leaders, such as churchleaders and traditional leaders; women 's and youth groups; traditional healers; and community structures such as Community Health Committees). Capacity-building will be accomplished through community meetings and participatorytraining workshops with an emphasis on HIV/AIDS and TB within the contextof community development. A questionnaire to measure attitudes andperceptions about home-based care will be administered at the initialworkshops, to serve as a baseline and then subsequently to measurechanges over time. Follow-up in-service updates will take place quarterly. 2. Home-based care The project will identify the minimum resources required for effective home- based care and establish a system to provide these to the primary caregivers.Training is required for all categories of caregivers, professionals, and healthworkers in both the public and private sectors as well as for traditionalhealers. The project will therefore coordinate the training of care-supporters (a/G05/G09 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSSouth Africa kind of grassroots-level supervisor/trainer) who will operate in their communities, each one supporting a number of primary caregivers. Support,in the form of regular meetings, monitoring, and in-service training, is plannedto ensure the quality of care is maintained. Bambisanani takes seriously thewidely confirmed experience that volunteers working in poor communitiesremain active, and function best, when they are provided with some form ofincentive. The project accepts this position and will provide volunteers withincentives in the form of transportation reimbursement, uniforms ordistinguishing attire, record-keeping materials, and token payments. 3. Care and support for children in distress (CINDI) Despite the recognition that increasing numbers of children are being severely affected by the epidemic, there are currently no means to identify thesechildren, nor is there a safety net for them. The initial part of this componentwill be intervention-linked research to establish mechanisms for identifyingchildren in distress. Care and support services to be provided for identifiedchildren will be linked both with the relevant Department of Health andDepartment of Welfare programmes (e.g., nutrition and grants) and with thedrop-in centres for life-skills and job-skills development. Also provided willbe training for professional social service providers and for youth laycounsellors. 4. Support for groups and income-generating activities (IGAs) Given the prevailing reality of extensive poverty, people living with HIV/AIDS and children in distress require special support groups and methods by whichthey can generate an income. IGAs such as building, food-related, farming,and other micro-enterprises will be available at each of the drop-in centres.The choice of IGAs will be identified through a research process. External mid-term and end-of-project evaluations will be conducted. The following expected outcomes at various levels will likely form the basicindicators of much of the evaluative work: - for patients/clients: reduced suffering and improved quality of life; appropriate treatment, care, and support; enhanced end-of-life care - for families: improved capacity to cope and to care; practical support; bereavement support - for caregivers: the capacity, resources, and support to deliver quality care; access to colleagues and community networks of support - for communities: improved capacity to cope; enhanced environment for care; reduced stigma; skills development and job creation - for children: early identification of children in distress; access to holistic care and support - for persons living with HIV/AIDS: skills development; access to networks of supportSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G05/G0ASouth Africa - for health services: reduced pressure on services; effective referrals between different service providers; cost savings - for welfare services: improved utilization of social services; better access to grants - for South Africa: lessons learned; replicable models. Outcomes The main outcomes to date are the establishment of a Project Management Committee consisting of Region E representatives, the development of adetailed implementation plan for year one, the mobilization of resources, theappointment of a project coordinator, and the commissioning of baselineresearch (the latter two are being finalized). Lessons Learned Bambisanani represents the application of a large number of lessons learned in various settings both within and outside South Africa. However, in theprocess of putting together the initiative, an important new lesson has beenlearned: the existence of great problems in seemingly separate sectors (in thiscase, the business, labour, welfare, and health sectors) can give rise tocreative responses and new resources (or most cost-efficient application ofexisting ones) if multisectoral approaches are applied. In itself, the AIDS epidemic represents an enormous challenge to South Africa's fledgling democracy. The requirements of projects such as Bambisanani must vie with many other high-priority transformation demandssuch as redressing the migrant labour system. However, by finding commonor complementary activities, the Region E project offers benefits not only tothe migrant mine workers and cane cutters but also to their families and thecommunities from which they come. Further Reading Though not about the project specifically, the following documents provide useful contextual information: the first about mine workers and their sexualpartners, the second about home-based care programmes, and the thirdabout the situation of children in South Africa.

Save the Children (UK in SA), 2000./G06/G0B Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDS Mother-to-child transmission Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the overwhelming source of HIV infection in young children. Without preventive intervention, the probability that an HIV-positive woman's baby will become infected ranges from 15 to 25 per cent inindustrialized countries and 25 to 35 per cent in developing countries. The virus may be transmitted during pregnancy, labour, delivery, or after the child's birth during breastfeeding. Where breastfeeding is the norm, it mayaccount for more than one-third of all transmissions. Since the beginning of thepandemic, about 90 per cent of all HIV-positive infants have been born in Africa.However, cases in India and Southeast Asia appear to be rising rapidly. In 1994 a regimen using the antiretroviral drug zidovudine (ZDV, also called AZT) was shown to reduce MTCT by about two-thirds in the absence of breastfeeding.This ACTG 076 regimen is now widely used in industrialized countries, but, at anaverage cost of US$ 1,000 per pregnancy, it is too expensive for widespread usein poor countries. In a trial concluded in Thailand in February 1998, a shortregimen of zidovudine pills in the last weeks of pregnancy cut the rate of MTCTduring childbirth by half, at less than a tenth of the cost of ACTG 076. Becausethe women were also given safe alternatives to breast milk, MTCT in the studypopulation was reduced to 9 per cent. Testing of newer, less costly regimens isongoing (see below). Any national strategy to prevent mother-to-child transmission should be part of broader strategies to prevent the transmission of HIV and STDs, to care forHIV-positive women and their families, and to promote maternal and childhealth. The ability to quickly make interventions to reduce MTCT widelyavailable depends on political will, affordability of the interventions, and thestrength of existing human resources and infrastructures. Powerful means ofeffecting change lie in demonstrating the success of interventions to reducemother-to-child transmission of HIV, as well as the costs of not acting toprevent this kind of transmission. Essential infrastructure and support services Four factors that affect the affordability of interventions to prevent mother-to- child transmission are: the cost of drugs; the cost of safe alternatives tobreastfeeding; the cost of HIV tests; and the cost of service delivery. WHOhas added ZDV for mother-to-child transmission to the Essential Drug List.Glaxo-Wellcome has recently offered ZDV at substantially reduced prices.Further negotiations are planned to minimize the cost of the first three ofthese factors. The following parameters describe the optimum context in which to implement effectively the interventions necessary to reduce transmission of HIV frommother to child:Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G06/G02/G01 All women should have knowledge about HIV and access to the information necessary to make appropriate choices about HIV prevention and aboutsexual and reproductive health and infant feeding in the context of HIV. /G01 HIV counselling should be available for pregnant women and those contemplating pregnancy. Such counselling should address reproductivehealth issues such as family planning and safe infant feeding. Active referraland/or networking for follow-up counselling, comprehensive care, and socialsupport should be available for HIV-positive women and their families. /G01 Pregnant women, and those contemplating pregnancy, should have access to voluntary HIV testing, to test results with the least possible delay (requiringthat appropriate laboratory services be available to process such tests), andto counselling. /G01 All pregnant women should have access to antenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, and to a skilled attendant at birth. /G01 There should be follow-up of children at least until 18 months, especially for nutrition and for childhood illnesses. Recent trials of antiretroviral regimens against MTCT In 1999, three existing randomized controlled trials of short-course zidovudine monotherapy conducted in Thailand and West Africa were concluded.Although the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to child was greater inthe breastfeeding populations, the relative decrease in transmission risk wassimilar for all three trials, between 40 and 50 per cent. Concurrently, another study, the PETRA trial, conducted a randomized controlled trial of HIV-positive pregnant women from three countries in Africa.There were four arms to the trial, three using various regimens of ZDV and3TC (lamivudine), the fourth using a placebo. Arm A of the trial includedantenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum intrapartum alone; and arm D the placebo. InSeptember 1999, the risk of transmission in each group was: Arm A 8.6%;Arm B 10.8%; Arm C 17.7%; Arm D 17.2%. In July 1999, a joint Uganda-US study compared the efficacy of a single dose of the antiretroviral drug nevirapine with a short regimen of ZDV given inlabour to the mother and administered to the baby for one week after delivery.HIV infection was reduced from 25 to 13 per cent in infants about threemonths of age (see HIVNET 012 study in this section)./G06/G03 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSUganda HIVNET 012 study on effectiveness of Nevirapine in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (Uganda) Starting Year : 1998 Main Topic Area : Mother-to-child transmission Other Topic Areas : Antiretroviral therapy \u007f Access to drugs Contact Person : Care and Support Team Phone: +42 22 791-4808 avenue AppiaCH-1211 Geneva 27Switzerland Contact Person : Department of Reproductive Health and Research Email: reproductivehealth@who.ch Web Site : www.who.int/rhtAddress: World Health Organization20 avenue Geneva 27Switzerland Implementers HIVNET 012 was undertaken at Mulago Hospital by researchers from Makerere University in Kampala and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,Maryland, USA. Funding The study was sponsored by the HIV Prevention Trials Network of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Glaxo-Wellcomeand Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals provided the drugs used in thestudy. Background A variety of trials of short-course zidovudine (ZDV) and/or nevirapine regimens are being conducted in Thailand and Africa. One, the PETRA study,is a randomized controlled trial that has recruited HIV-positive pregnantwomen from five sites: two in South Africa, two in Uganda, and one inTanzania. There are four arms to the trial, three using various regimens ofZDV and 3TC (lamivudine), the fourth using a placebo. Another study, ACTG316, is ongoing in the United States, Europe, and Brazil. It compares acombination of zidovudine and nevirapine with zidovudine monotherapy.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G06/G04Uganda Finally, a trial called SAINT (South African Intrapartum Nevirapine Trial) in South Africa aims to recruit 1,200 HIV-infected mothers and compare theHIVNET 012 nevirapine regimen with arm B of PETRA. Results should beavailable by June 2000. (For more on ongoing research trials into MTCT, seewww.unaids.org/publications/documents/mtct/prevmtct.html .) Main Activities The study was a randomized controlled trial enrolling 645 mothers (average age 24) and their infants living in and around Kampala. The dosage regimenfor nevirapine was a single dose of 200mg given to the mother to take at theonset of labour, followed by 2mg per kg given to the neonate within 72 hoursof birth. This was compared with a ZDV regimen of 600mg started by themother at the onset of labour, followed by 300mg of ZDV every three hoursduring labour and a further course of ZDV of 4mg per kg given to the infant forseven days after birth. Outcomes The primary measures were of HIV infection and HIV survival at 6 -8 weeks and 14-16 weeks. Of 609 mother -infant pairs, data were available for 529 at 14-16 weeks. At 6 -8 weeks, 11.9 per cent of infants in the nevirapine group were HIV-infected, compared to 21.3 per cent of those in the ZDV group. At14-16 weeks, the figures were 13.1 and 25.1 per cent, respectively. Lessons Learned A technical working group composed of experts from WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and the UNAIDS Secretariat reports consensus on the followingpoints: 1. Nevirapine is cheap and simple to administer. Uganda has made relatively simple calculations of the costs of buying drug to treat all HIV-positivepregnant women in the country. For nevirapine, this would amount to$640,000 per year. With zidovudine, the cost would be $21,450,000 per year,and if the PETRA trial arm B were adopted this would cost $29,250,000 peryear. With this overwhelming cost difference, it is likely that nevirapine will bewidely seen as the drug of choice for this indication. 2. The low price of nevirapine must not blind decision-makers to the fact that effective MTCT interventions are not simply a matter of finding the right drugat the right price. Although drugs are a substantial element of the pilotprojects, many of the additional components of the projects are independentof which drug is used. This includes the infrastructure of voluntary andconfidential testing, many aspects of antenatal and postnatal care of women,psychosocial support to HIV-infected women, and the follow-up of babies todetermine their HIV infection status. These elements need to be initiated andmaintained regardless of what drug is recommended, now or in the future.Other elements of the infrastructure, however, such as laboratory testing(mainly haemoglobin measurement), the frequency of antenatal clinicalattendance, and the monitoring of women for drug toxicity would be moreextensive with short-course zidovudine than with nevirapine./G06/G05 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSUganda 3. Voluntary counselling and testing are necessary. Although there has been discussion about using nevirapine in settings with high HIV seroprevelancewithout voluntary and confidential testing for HIV, there is consensus that thiswas not a desirable strategy. Even if nevirapine is safe for use in women whoare HIV uninfected, the importance of women being aware of their HIV statusoffers substantial additional benefits. These include improved decision-makingand the ability to plan for future health and well-being of families, andprevention of subsequent sexual transmission. 4. Considerations of risk and of drug resistance must continue to be examined. The beneficial effect of antiretrovirals given for MTCT prevention (asignificant reduction in the baby's risk of infection with a fatal virus) faroutweighs any risk to the infant. However, these risks have been and mustcontinue to be researched. One serious risk - that of developing drug- resistant strains of HIV - is considered to be minimal when antiretrovirals are used for a short period of time. Research and extensive experience with ZDVsince 1987 indicate that the virus takes at least three months to developresistance to the drug when used as monotherapy. On the other hand, HIVhas been shown to develop resistance to nevirapine monotherapy veryquickly. Since only a single dose of nevirapine has been given to mother andbaby in the study of MTCT prevention, resistance is not expected to be aproblem, but no data are yet available to confirm this. If antiretroviral drugsare used in combination, resistance is even slower to develop than withmonotherapy, as they offer the virus a more complex challenge. At present,however, the risk of developing drug resistance if a woman is treated with thesame drug over several pregnancies is not known.

For relatively long periods, people with HIVinfection may suffer a variety of opportunistic infections or cancers,experience multiple symptoms, and face a myriad of psychosocial issues.Moreover, the disease progression is unpredictable: declining health mayalternate with periods of physical and emotional stability, resulting in chronicuncertainty. As people reach the end of their illness, testing and treatmentsmay have little long-term benefit and merely add to the distress of the patient. Fortunately, many HIV-associated illnesses - or their symptoms - are relatively easy to treat with basic drugs. Doing so can greatly improve thequality of life of HIV-positive people, as well reducing stress on the peoplecaring for them. Major symptoms include: /G01 pain, often increasing in severity as the disease progresses /G01 diarrhoea and constipation /G01 nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss /G01 cough and shortness of breath /G01 malaise, weakness, and fatigue /G01 fever /G01 psychological problems /G01 brain impairment. The importance of pain relief No one should have to suffer from uncontrolled pain. Treatment of the underlying condition is important but in all cases pain relief is a priority. Healthworkers should not withhold pain relief for fear that a person will becomeaddicted to pain killers or taking medication. Pain medication should bereviewed frequently and increased when needed. Access to analgesics and palliative care drugs In many countries, analgesics such as codeine and other opiates can be prescribed only by doctors. This can strongly reduce access to analgesics insettings where most palliative care is delivered by nursing staff or communitycaregivers. A balance between increasing access to adequate painmedication and careful supervision and record keeping of prescriptions ofopiate analgesics is needed./G06/G07 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSThe special needs of children with HIV Since children often do not verbalize their problems, their palliative needs are frequently ignored, particularly in resource-poor health systems. As well,counselling children about death and dying is often avoided on the groundsthat it causes more harm than good. Organizing care in different settings There are many ways of organizing palliative care delivery, depending on such factors as health sector resources and social organization. They include: /G01 Home care: Community-based home care has proven cost-effective in many settings, with the added benefit of helping communities come together, raiseawareness, and promote tolerance and acceptance. /G01 Day centres : Patients remain living at home while going out for palliative care, counselling and emotional support, and such services as cooked meals, childcare, and even income-generation activities. Family or hired caregivers alsobenefit by receiving time off during the day. /G01 Hospice care : Facilities for people in terminal stages of AIDS are particularly helpful for people who live alone, have poor symptom control, or suffer fromdifficult-to-manage symptoms such as severe brain impairment. Hospicesmay also provide respite periods for caregivers . As well, traditional healers and alternative systems should not be ignored in places where they are widely accepted and can provide symptomatic treatmentor pain relief with herbal remedies or practices such as acupuncture. In thesesettings, therefore, such healers and alternative practitioners may be included inthe palliative side of care planning and practice. Give palliative care recognition In countries with limited drug budgets, palliative care medicines are not always seen as a priority compared to curative drugs. Yet many of the drugsand services that can benefit people with HIV are cheap, readily available,and listed as WHO essential drugs. Political commitment, backed byincreased resources, is essential to care for the increasing numbers of peoplewith HIV, and to train caregivers and health care workers. Because palliativeand supportive care needs are often overlooked, they must be emphasized innational strategic plans. There is also need for coordination with donors toensure that palliative care is seen as a priority; resource mobilization isessential to strengthen these efforts.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G06/G08Uganda Mildmay Centre for Palliative HIV/AIDS Care (Uganda) Starting Year : 1998 Main Topic Area : Palliative care Other Topic Areas : Community mobilization \u007f Health system personnel and training Contact Person : Dr Catherine SoziDirector of Clinical Services is a UK-based NGO that has gained wide experience in HIV/AIDS care and training. It is connected with the Mildmay Hospital inEngland. Funding The project is funded by the United Kingdom 's Department for International Development (DFID) and received initial support from the World Bank for theprocurement of equipment. Objectives Mildmay Centre's objective is to provide palliative care and rehabilitation for persons living with AIDS in the local community. The centre defines palliativecare as \"the active total care of someone with an incurable illness, where thecontrol of pain and other physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritualneeds are paramount, and where the goal is an improved quality of life. Therelief of pain and other distressing symptoms can lead to prolonging life,which in turn benefits the immediate community both socially andeconomically. It is also intended to facilitate a comfortable death with bothpeace and dignity.\" Background With antiretroviral therapy out of the financial reach of most Ugandans, Mildmay was invited by the Ugandan Ministry of Heath to establish an AIDSPalliative Care and Training Centre, in the belief that this form of care canreduce the suffering and improve the quality of life of those infected with thevirus. One by-product of this type of care is expected to be that the country/G06/G09 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSUganda benefits from the prolongation of the individual's economic and social productivity and that children benefit from a longer period of parental care. The Mildmay Centre, which has been operational since September 1998, is situated 14 km along the Entebbe Road from Kampala City within the MpigiDistrict. It provides comprehensive outpatient palliative care, and rehabilitativeservices, for men, women, adolescents, and children living with or affected byHIV/AIDS. Main Activities Mildmay does not become the patient's primary carer, which remains the role of the referring doctor, nurse, or counsellor. Rather, Mildmay is a specialistreferral centre, which aims to support existing services and to actively supportthe principle of rehabilitation. Its main activities are: 1. Care The centre provides holistic, high-quality care and advice, and emphasizes that respect for the concerns, rights, and beliefs of each individual is animportant part of that care. It uses multidisciplinary therapies involving a teamof professionals including doctors, nurses, nursing assistants, counsellors(including those skilled in working with children), a physiotherapist,occupational therapist, aromatherapist, and a nutritional adviser. It also haspastoral care workers, laboratory personnel, pharmacy staff, and a volunteerworkforce to accompany patients around the centre. Patients pay for the carethrough a registration fee and a small follow-up fee, but provision is made forserving children and adults who are unable to pay (see Funding for care andtreatment). 2. Training of carers Holistic care involves not only the staff and volunteers at the centre, but also the caregivers (mostly family members of patients) at home, who arerecognized and valued as the main source of most patients' care. Workshopsfor caregivers were started in response to the need of the caregivers toacquire appropriate nursing and psychological skills to give them confidenceas they care for a patient at home. The workshops, coordinated by thenurses, take place at the end of every month and are run by theinterdisciplinary team. Some of the topics covered during the workshops are:simple nursing techniques; bed bathing; care and prevention of pressuresores; mouth care; patient toileting; lifting and handling for patients; drug administration; and dying; a difficult patient; communicatingwith children; modes of HIV transmission; positive living; activities 3. Capacity-building in AIDS palliative care Mildmay has implemented educational programmes to help improve care throughout the region, with an emphasis on building local capacity in AIDSpalliative care. Workshops, which include core components, are adapted forSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G06/G0AUganda each audience. Participants include: health workers and health professionals (doctors, nurses, counsellors, social workers, volunteers, community healthworkers, and so on); government and NGO staff, including policy-makers andmedia; students and teachers in schools; workers; men, women, children, andadolescents living with HIV/AIDS (for example, workshops for HIV-positivefathers and mothers); employers and employees in businesses or institutions;journalists; and religious leaders. The Mobile Clinical Training Team takestraining to the rural districts - the team visits agreed-upon health centres run by the MOH, conducts a needs assessment, and develops a trainingprogramme. Trainees spend one week at the Mildmay Centre and then, overa period of a year, are provided follow-up and further training by the mobile team. 4. Support for HIV-positive young people Children are now living longer with HIV/AIDS, occasionally up to 16 years of age. Some, who are suffering from chronic disabling conditions, have specialcare needs that families and communities have great difficulty providing.Since the HIV-positive individuals fall sick often, have left school, or areorphans, their needs are very rarely recognized and planned for. As well, thetransition from childhood to adolescence is a difficult time, during which theHIV-positive adolescent is undergoing exactly the same social and emotionalstresses as those who are HIV-negative. To assist these young people,Mildmay has formed an adolescents ' club, Our Generation Mildmay Adolescent Club (OGMAC). It teaches adolescents how to improve or cope with variousaspects of their lives (e.g., nutrition, reproductive and sexual health, positivebehavioural change) and to encourage them to seek health services. 5. Funding for care and treatment It became apparent very early on in the project that caregivers were unable to pay for all the services needed, not only for themselves but for all the childreninfected or affected. The Hardship Fund was set up by Mildmay International(the parent NGO in England) to help pay for the care and treatment of allchildren and adolescents, as well as for a few adults. Outcomes In its first year, the Mildmay Centre registered a total of 980 patients, of whom 80 per cent had referral letters, and provided services to thousands more. Themajority of referrals (90 per cent) are from within and around the Kampala andEntebbe area. Mildmay receives these referrals from home-care organizations(e.g., Hospice Uganda and the Joint Home Care Team); HIV-related NGOs(e.g., the AIDS Support Organization and the AIDS Information Centre);traditional healers; private doctors, practitioners, and hospitals; andgovernment organizations such as the Mulago Hospital and Health Centres.The major problems of referred patients were persistent or recurring pain(47%), cough (39%), and skin problems (38%). Of the 980 patients the femaleto male ratio was 4:3. By the end of March 2000, over 10,500 people had been served since the opening of the centre, and there were 1,450 new registrations, of whom 230were children under the age of 19 years. The average age of the children was8.5, with about one-quarter between 10 and 19 years of age./G07/G0B Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSUganda Evaluation Findings Every three months, clients (the patient and/or their caregiver) fill out assessment forms so that the centre can monitor their views. Similarly, staffmake presentations at audit meetings, and every department within the centrecarries out three monthly audits of the care that is provided. Quarterly reportsare forwarded to DFID and to Mildmay International for scrutiny. One audit,taken after six months of operation, indicated that a patient-centred approachusing multidisciplinary therapies was both appropriate and beneficial topatients reviewed: 42% of symptoms were gone and 18% of symptoms weresignificantly improved by the end of four visits to the centre. In this study, mostpatients (70%) had at least one investigation, with microbiology being themost frequently requested investigation (microscopy, Ziel Nielson, and gramstain). Therapies or services prescribed by the doctors included medication(88% being at least on Cotrimoxozole spiritual support/counselling (16%), with skin complaints being referred for aromatherapy,nutritional advice (31%), and occupational therapy (5%). Ten per cent werereferred to hospital and 0.5% to home care through a referral system that hasbeen developed with the Joint Home-Care Teams. Lessons Learned In a phase of the epidemic when the need for palliative care is insufficiently recognized, the activities of the Mildmay Centre show that such care can beprovided in a way that complements and even strengthens the existingsystems of medical services and home and community care. Palliative caredoes indeed improve the quality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS, andcan be managed so that clinical staff and home caregivers work togetherrather than in isolation. The educational and capacity-building components ofthe project serve to reinforce the understanding of palliative care's benefitsamong a much wider group of people than would otherwise be the case. One of the lessons that Mildmay (like so many other community care projects) has learned is that burnout among caregivers is an ongoing problem that mustbe addressed. This means that projects must plan for the fact that caregivers,like patients, need emotional and psychological support. In order to help dealwith caregiver and staff burnout before individuals reach crisis stages, acounselling service is provided, which is independent of the centre. On the clinical side, Mildmay has found it extremely useful to hold weekly interdisciplinary meetings in which patients are discussed, and staff membersshare their different perspectives on the patients. This helps overcome theproblem that patients often communicate only part of their story, symptoms, orproblems to each team member they see. At these meetings the whole pictureis clearer, and more effective plans may be applied. These meetings also helpstaff members share their feelings and emotions towards the situations they arepresented with - another useful technique for countering staff burnout.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G07/G02 Religion In many countries, HIV/AIDS continues to be perceived and treated exclusively as a health or medical problem. However, it is becomingincreasingly evident that successful national AIDS programmes are those thathave broadened their focus from the urgency of encouraging individualbehavioural change to include the necessity of addressing how societiesbehave towards persons living with or affected by HIV/AIDS, and towardsvulnerable individuals in general. A number of institutional settings provide opportunities for collective action to strengthen HIV/AIDS prevention and care efforts. These include schools,health care facilities, the military, and the workplace. One of the mostimportant, however, is religious institutions. This is because of the moralleadership that such institutions provide to hundreds of millions of peopleworldwide, the trust they have gained over generations, and the excellentchannels of communication and organization that many have built up. Around the world, individual places of worship within communities (including churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and hospitals with religiousaffiliations) have undertaken their own initiatives to deal with HIV/AIDS and itsimpact at a local level. These initiatives have included advocating changes inlocal community attitudes, speaking out against prejudice, raising money, andorganizing home-based care. At the same time, regional and national religious hierarchies in some countries have undertaken wide-ranging activities, sometimes moving well ahead ofmany local members. In Africa, religious leaders confronted HIV/AIDS earlyon in the epidemic, and religious institutions were among the first to care forthe sick and dying. In many parts of Asia, Buddhist monks and nuns and otherreligious groups are very much involved in caring for people living withHIV/AIDS. Many spiritual leaders have grappled with the difficult questionsthat the epidemic poses to theology, and have found that discussion of thesequestions can have beneficial effects on faith and religious teaching. A two-pronged focus appears to be developing in the engagement of the religious sector in various parts of the world: /G01 To promote the exchange of ideas and training for community-based prevention and care programmes. This has been done through conferencesand symposia, as well as the creation of interfaith alliances both at local andhigher levels. /G01 To encourage religious institutions to strengthen life-skills training for HIV/AIDS education in schools operated by their congregations./G07/G03 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSZambia Treasuring the Gift (Zambia) Starting Year : 1998 Main Topic Area : Religion Other Topic Areas : Children and young people \u007f Reproductive health Contact Person : Ms. Robie Lusaka Interfaith HIV/AIDS Networking Group (Christian Council of Zambia, Evangelical Fellowship of Zambia, Makeni Islamic Community, ZambianEpiscopal Conference, Bahai Community, independent churches, and theSalvation Army) with support from Project Concern International (Zambia) Funding Project Concern International (Zambia) Objectives The aim of the project is to support, strengthen, and sustain leaders of youth groups attached to religious organizations, using their religious values andtraditions to promote good sexual health. The project's operational objective was to develop sexual health learning materials that require little or no literacy among participants, and that enableyouth groups attached to religious organizations to: - gain relevant and accurate information on sexuality, reproduction, and HIV/AIDS and other STDs - develop values and attitudes that will promote sexual health- practise skills necessary for good sexual health- support their members in promoting their sexual health- take action in their communities to promote sexual health. Background The project was designed to provide sexual health learning activities to religious youth groups, and especially to youth no longer in school. There aremany myths about HIV in Zambia, and many young people lack adequateinformation and life skills. This is especially the case among out-of-schoolSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G07/G04Zambia youth, who, in addition, are hampered by low literacy. Religious groups have recognized the need for new ways of preparing youth for adolescence andadulthood and are asking for support in this area. In many communities, in thecities as well as in the countryside, religious groups are the only form oforganization with links outside the community. They are therefore an idealchannel for communication of sexual health messages. A number of conditions and concerns are particular to Zambia and to specific faiths, and these had to be dealt with and taken into account: - The gap between puberty and marriage in Zambia can be ten years or more. Social and religious rules still ask that young people abstain from sex untilmarriage. - Dating has been one outlet for adolescents wanting premarital contact with the opposite sex, although in some cultures, such as Islam, it is expresslyforbidden. This social invention did not exist when most religions werefounded, nor does it exist in traditional Zambian society, so there is very littleguidance on the subject. Even when acceptable, the culture of dating isdifferent in Zambia than in the West. In the West, young people can haveboyfriends or girlfriends without engaging in sex. In Zambia, most youngpeople understand boyfriends and girlfriends to mean someone you have sexwith. In those religious communities that allow dating, efforts should be madeto change this understanding, so that dating without sex becomes establishedas a norm for young people. - Studies of sexual behaviour in Zambia have found that people with \"stricter\" religious beliefs are less likely to use condoms, even though many of themmay have sex outside marriage, increasing the risk of HIV for many religiousbelievers. Religious communities have a responsibility to tackle this issue. Main Activities A consultant writer was assigned to produce a book aimed at religious communities to help them prepare youth for adulthood in a world with AIDS(Zambia has one of the highest HIV rates in the world). The book productionprocess involved: - recruitment of a production team, made up of professionals, NGO representatives, and youth from a variety of religious organizations; theproduction team consisted of 14 young school leavers in their early twenties;the Lusaka Interfaith Networking Group identified youths to work with theconsultant, who trained them to prepare the materials - training for the team, involving information about sexual health and religious attitudes to sexual health; the dominant training methodology was use ofparticipatory learning activities - choosing topics for inclusion in the learning pack (personal values, communication skills, risky situations and self-control, dealing with negativepeer pressure, interpersonal relationships, puberty and masturbation,reproduction, pregnancy, abortion, STDs, HIV prevention, living withHIV/AIDS, and breaking traditional barriers)/G07/G05 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSZambia - participatory research by production team members upon return to their youth groups, using participatory learning and action (PLA) techniquesincluding mapping, flow diagrams, and focus groups. The production cycle involved a series of meetings designed to test the activities as well as graphics, diagrams, and other elements, and adapt themas needed. That information was then fed into the writing process.Representatives of the Interfaith Group were consulted at each stage of theprocess and met with young people from the production team and thefacilitators to make suggestions for improvement. There was agreement thatthere should be only one book for all faiths, rather than separate versions forChristians, Muslims and Bahais. Outcomes Treasuring the Gift: How to handle God's gift of sex, is a 142-page book for leaders of religious youth groups. It contains 18 participatory learningactivities, supported by 47 pages of background information. The material issuitable for children and youth from the age of 10 upwards and can be usedby mixed or single-sex groups. The instructions are clearly laid out and writtenin simple English to facilitate translation. It is fully illustrated with diagrams,line drawings, and photographs. Users of the book need only a minimum oftraining in facilitation and participatory approaches. The activities are designed to encourage honest discussion about the realities of sexual behaviour among young people, religious and non-religious, and toallow youth to practise the skills they need to avoid emotional hurt, unplannedpregnancy, or infection with STDs, including HIV. Each topic is supported byinformation and advice, to enable facilitators to lead discussions and answerquestions with confidence. Among other, more indirect outcomes:- an Islamic youth group has been created that plans to continue after the end of the programme, broadening its activities beyond sexual health and HIVprevention; - the Salvation Army (a Christian group) is planning a youth HIV-prevention workshop to share the work of its two participants in the programme; - one participant has been asked to facilitate a day's workshop on sexual health and HIV prevention with one of the youth groups where she wasconducting pretests. One of the programme objectives was to produce a resource that did not require literacy from participants. It was thought that PLA techniques might besuitable, as they do not require literacy. The book is very easy to use: theinstructions are simple, and a young person with only a few days ' training can use it successfully. During the pretesting, some young people who were notpart of the programme, and had had no training at all, used the book to leadgroups.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G07/G06Zambia Lessons Learned The project clearly demonstrates how using young people themselves to disseminate messages is highly effective. In addition, the following lessonswere learned: - Participatory approaches increase the confidence and experience of those who use them, and being involved in all phases of a production processensures that facilitators will find it easy to teach the materials they helpeddesign. - Interfaith approaches to sensitive topics do work as long as representatives of religious groups are brought in at the beginning of the process andconsulted throughout. - High levels of literacy are not essential to use text-based sexual health information materials. - Using outside consultants is often necessary, but their work can be made more effective by including target groups in the process from the outset. Theconsultant recruited for the project had worked in Zambia before and hadprevious experience in producing reproductive health materials for a Zambianaudience. These considerations encouraged cooperation with the InterfaithNetworking Group and enhanced their willingness to collaborate. Theconsultant was identified by Project Concern International, and wasimmediately accepted because of the strong existing relationship betweenProject Concern and the Interfaith Group.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G07/G08 School-based interventions and services There are more than one billion adolescents in the world. Their number in developing countries - over 800 million - will increase by 20 per cent in the next 15 years. Young people are society 's future, and it is essential to invest heavily in them so that they can protect their own health and influence andeducate their peers. This requires effective AIDS education programmes inschool alongside preventive efforts in the community and the media. Education is a national concern in all parts of the world, and so cooperation at the highest levels of government is important in making school AIDSeducation programmes work. Experience in various parts of the worldindicates that, working in collaboration with ministries of education and withhealth and social services, each country's national AIDS programme shouldaim to provide all schoolchildren with AIDS education. Effective AIDS education includes information on prevention, care, and support for people with HIV/AIDS, and on non-discrimination. Education of thiskind has been shown to help young people to delay sex and, when theybecome sexually active, to avoid risk behaviour. However, children and youngpeople are often denied AIDS education in school. Reasons for this includethe sensitive or controversial nature of the subject in some societies, and thedifficulty of finding time for AIDS education in an already overcrowdedcurriculum. In some places, schools may teach information on AIDS but notthe behavioural skills needed for prevention and support. Best practices in school-based interventions include: /G01 partnerships among policy-makers, religious and community leaders, parents, and teachers to set sound policies on AIDS education /G01 designing a good curriculum and/or a good extracurricular programme, one that is adapted to local culture and circumstances and that focuses on lifeskills rather than biomedical information /G01 teaching primary and secondary students to analyse and respond to social norms, including understanding which ones are potentially harmful andwhich ones protect their health and well-being /G01 good training, both for teachers and for peer educators (that is, young people from the same age group, specifically selected to educate theirfriends and acquaintances about AIDS) /G01 starting HIV-prevention and health programmes for children at the earliest possible age, and certainly before the onset of sexual activity. Effectively,age-appropriate programmes should start at the primary school level./G07/G09 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSUganda Straight Talk (Uganda) Starting Year : 1993 Main Topic Area : School-based interventions and services Other Topic Areas : Communications programming \u007f Reproductive health \u007f Male condoms \u007f Children and young people Contact Person : Ms. Anne Akia, Programme DirectorMs. Catherine Watson, Editorial Director Phone: +256 41 543 025 or 543 884 Fax: +256 41 543 884 Email: strtalk@swiftuganda.com or strtalk@imul.com : www.swiftuganda.com/~strtalkAddress: Straight Talk FoundationP.O. Box 22366KampalaUganda Implementers Straight Talk Foundation is a communications NGO based in Kampala. Funding Funders include UNICEF, Sida, DANIDA, Save the Children Alliance, USAID (through Population Services International), the Ford Foundation, theDepartment for International Development, UK (DFID), and the EuropeanUnion (from 2000). Objectives The goal is to encourage adolescents to delay sexual activity and to adopt safer sexual behaviours once they do become active. The mission statementincludes \"keeping adolescents safe\" and \"communication for better health.\" Background Straight Talk is a monthly four-page newsletter that targets secondary school students between the ages of 15 and 19 as well as young adults in collegesand universities (aged 20 -24). The newsletter advocates safer sex, including abstinence, masturbation, non-penetrative sex, and condom use. Its counterpart for younger people, Young Talk , is aimed at upper primary school pupils and young adolescents aged 10 -14. Key topics include changes at puberty, a child's rights and responsibilities, and general body health andhygiene. Young Talk advocates abstinence, although information about condoms is provided if the children request it. Those who say they areSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G07/G0AUganda sexually active are advised to reconsider their actions. In primary schools, teachers are encouraged to use Young Talk as a teaching tool. Both publications take a strong moral stand against exploitative and manipulative relationships and advocate respect for family values. The publications led to the creation of the Straight Talk Foundation, a communication NGO that produces information, education, andcommunication (IEC) materials for adolescents. Part of the foundation'smandate is to keep its target audience (Ugandan adolescents, aged 10 -19, and young adults, aged 20 -24) safe from STD/HIV infection. Main Activities The main activities are the publication of the two newsletters, Straight Talk and Young Talk , which are distributed free of charge throughout Uganda (see Outcomes). Straight Talk is available in English, but is also translated into two local languages and published four times a year for out-of-school adolescents whohave difficulties with English. In April 1999 a Straight Talk radio show was launched on two popular English FM stations. It is now on five FM stationsand reaches almost countrywide. Local-language programmes are planned. Both newsletters are published by professionals but are in fact \"adolescent- driven.\" The information published in them is determined by the content ofletters received from readers. Message content is periodically pretestedamong adolescents. The newsletters offer age-appropriate information onreproductive health, life skills, and rights for adolescents. In terms ofHIV/AIDS preventive actions, they stress the delay of sexual activity and theimportance of safer sex for those who are already sexually active. The publications are complemented by visits by the Straight Talk team of doctors and other visitors to a dozen schools each term in about six districts.During a school visit, a team of adolescent-friendly doctors and counsellorsspends the first two days sensitizing teachers about adolescent behaviour,body changes, and so on. The next two days are spent with 150 studentsfrom one school; the last two days with students from a second school.Students decide what topics they want to discuss. These range from love andsex to relationships with parents and the oppositve sex, STDs/HIV, bodychanges (menstruation, wet dreams, breast size, penis size) and life skills.Role plays based on several scenarios are enacted by students. The dayends with one-on-one counselling. Another activity associated with the project is the almost 200 Straight Talk clubs that have been founded by students in schools throughout Uganda. Outcomes Straight Talk has a print run of 150,000 a month and is sent to 1,400 secondary schools. Young Talk has a print run of 270,000 per month and is also placed as an insert in the New Vision newspaper (40,000 copies); it is sent to 12,000 primary schools. In addition, about 130 large NGOs, 426tertiary education institutions, 50 community groups and churches, 191Straight Talk clubs formed by students, and 149 medical institutions receive/G08/G0B Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSUganda the newsletters. The newsletter costs US$ 0.07 per copy but is distributed free of charge. In terms of feedback, Straight Talk receives over 3,000 letters per year from readers. Evaluation Findings An evaluation in 1995 after 16 issues found that all secondary school students surveyed had seen Straight Talk . The evaluation found that 8 per cent of the 1,682 adolescents surveyed cited Straight Talk as their main source of information on HIV. Radio ranked first at 43 per cent. Lessons Learned The project has shown that it is possible for health educators to talk about sex, even in conservative societies. It is crucial to find the right tone, however,so as not to offend the existing culture, and for the information to be backedby correct medical facts. Other lessons learned include: 1. The information given to an audience must be supported by the teaching of practical life skills and values, otherwise it will not be of much use to therecipient. 2. Adolescent involvement in such work must be guided by properly prepared adults. Adolescents do want and need guidance, but at the same time, theyand their opinions must be respected. 3. In order to maximize resources, it is important to use the cheapest means possible. In Straight Talk 's experience, using newsprint instead of glossy paper has been very beneficial. Approximately ten people share a single copyof the newsletter. 4. Producing materials is only half the battle. It is important to place a great deal of effort and thought into the dissemination of materials produced,otherwise they will not reach the audience. To this end, it is important to havecontacts with NGOs, newspapers and all forms of distribution outlets toestablish a successful distribution network.

HIV/AIDS is a new issue that has fuelled concern over sex workand how societies think about and dealt with it. It has, however, also broughtto light many of the underlying factors that feed this trade and make it unsafe. There are several categories of sex workers among the women, men, and transgendered persons in the trade. Most often the sex trade is thought of interms of full-time sex workers found in brothels. Those working in thesesituations are frequently called prostitutes or \"call girls,\" and are in working relationships with pimps, madams, or owners. A second category comprises\"casual\" or \"indirect\" sex workers, who exchange sex for money or for favours or gifts, either on an ad hoc basis or as a second employment. Such sexworkers are less inclined to have a \"business manager. \" In a third category are those sex workers who are forced into sex work and may be held inbondage for short or long periods of time. All of these categories include, togreater or lesser degrees, the sexual exploitation of young people andwomen. The category that the sex worker finds herself in, as well as her age,may determine the extent to which she can protect herself from HIV and STDtransmissions (this is also true for males in the trade). In many countries, HIV was first identified in the sex work population. As the epidemic grew, international agencies, governments, and NGOs recognizedthe need to create interventions for this vulnerable group who engage in riskbehaviour and do not often have the means or knowledge to reduce their riskof infection. At the same time, negative social and political views of sex workhave used and continue to use HIV/AIDS as a reason to create and enforcelaws that marginalize and criminalize sex workers. Initial responses were primarily promotion and distribution of condoms to sex workers, and dissemination of information. Most of these programmes aretargeted to the sex worker, ignoring the clients and the brothel owners ormanagers. Educational and enabling strategies are the two main elementsused when addressing sex work and STD/HIV/AIDS, but the most successfulprojects include components of both. They also involve people who influencecommercial sex activity: clients; owners and managers; police officials; community leaders; the media; neighbours andfamilies. The most effective comprehensive projects are frequently those carried out by men or women who are or have been sex workers. This approach is usuallyreferred to as peer education, but can and should go beyond the educationalaspects of HIV/STD education. Other important methods used in HIV/STD sexwork programmes are:/G08/G03 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDS/G01 outreach or fieldwork - going to sex workers and their bosses in their workplace, at informal meeting places, or at times in their homes, speakingwith clients in bars and clubs /G01 group education sessions through outreach work /G01 distribution of educational material for sex workers, bosses, and clients /G01 promotion and distribution of, and easy access to, condoms and lubricants (again this needs to address all parties concerned and not only the sexworker) /G01 creating or strengthening an enabling environment through provision of and access to health, social, and legal services, especially appropriatemanagement of STDs and confidential counselling services /G01 networking of sex workers - locally, nationally, and regionally - to advocate for protective laws, safer working conditions, and safer services, and toexchange information and experiences /G01 economic development programmes, including skills training, that offer alternative means of employment to sex workers /G01 strategies for drug-using sex workers, including needle-exchange, non- injectable drugs, and harm-reduction methods /G01 advocacy for a socially and legally supportive environment - working with communities to change social norms and with policy-makers and law-enforcers to address legal issues that affect sex workers.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G08/G04C\u00f4te d'Ivoire PPP: Programme for care and prevention among female sex workers (C \u00f4te d'Ivoire) Starting Year : 1991 Main Topic Area : Sex workers and clients Other Topic Areas : Male condoms \u007f Sexually transmitted diseases Contact Person : Dr Ayokoin Michel +225 de lutte contre le SIDA Implementers The National AIDS Programme (PNLS - Programme national de lutte contre le SIDA) provides the institutional home for the PPP within the C \u00f4te d'Ivoirian health system, and oversees its administrative and financial management. Itprovides an office, audiovisual support, and access to vehicles andeducational materials. However, other organizations are or have been deeplyinvolved with programme, including: - National Institute for Public Health (INSP - Institut national de sant \u00e9 publique) - Projet Retro-Ci (a collaborative project of the Ministry of Health and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium - Population Services International (PSI)- WHO and UNAIDS. Funding Principal funding over the years has been provided by WHO, UNAIDS, the Institute of Tropical Medicine of Antwerp, UNDP, and UNFPA. Objectives The programme targets three main groups: sex workers (both professional and non-professional); their clients and sex partners; and the owners andoperators of locations where the sex trade occurs. Its overall objectives havebeen to: - increase knowledge of the risks of HIV and STD infection- improve access to condoms- improve access to STD and other medical care/G08/G05 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSC\u00f4te d'Ivoire Background The sex trade in C \u00f4te d'Ivoire has an ambiguous status: it is illegal, yet it is tolerated by the authorities and widely used by men from all sectors ofsociety. As early as 1990, levels of HIV prevalence among sex workers in thecapital, Abidjan, were known to be over 50 per cent and condom use was low.A study of HIV prevalence among clients of sex workers found HIV infectionamong approximately one-fifth of those tested. In a pilot project in 1990, the INSP carried out a survey of 130 sex workers and proprietors in the Adiopoume area of Abidjan. This was followed in 1991by group discussions with sex workers and clients, a KAP (knowledge,attitudes, and practices) survey, and other research that permitted the sextrade to be analysed and mapped. Findings included a high number ofmigrants among sex workers, low knowledge of STDs and HIV, low condomuse, and extremely limited access to medical attention. Based on the needsdemonstrated by this research, the programme was instituted by the INSP inJuly 1991 in three of ten communes (boroughs). Coverage was extended to all communes in 1993 -94, when the programme took on its formal name (Programme de pr \u00e9vention et de prise en charge des MST/SIDA chez les femmes et leurs partenaires), and came under theauthority of the PNLS. It has since been extended to four other cities: Bouake,Daloa, Korhogo, and San-Pedro. Staff include health educators, sociologists,and government social workers, along with peer educators recruited fromamong the sex workers. In 1992, a separate project called Projet Retro-Ci (a collaboration of the Ministry of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Institute ofTropical Medicine) created a clinic in the borough of Koumassi, where a largenumber of sex workers were known to live or work. Although created andfinanced as essentially a research centre, the Clinique de Confiancecollaborates with the larger programme by providing salary support to thePPP's 18 health educators and participating in the PPP's monthly meetings.The clinic performs outreach to nine out of ten boroughs of Abidjan, andprovides clinical services for STDs and voluntary HIV counselling and testing. It should be noted that the life of the programme has coincided with a variety of prevention initiatives undertaken by the government, including mass mediaAIDS awareness campaigns and social marketing of condoms (the latter incollaboration with PSI). Main Activities The programme comprises three main components: 1. Community mobilization and education. Activities include:- educating and involving all interested parties in prevention work, including local government authorities, leaders of immigrant communities, owners ofbars or hotels in which sex work takes place, and leaders among thecommunity of sex workers; - educational meetings in places where prostitutes live or work; the meetings' agenda includes information about AIDS and other STDs, preventionmethods, testing, and STD services, and a demonstration of proper condomSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G08/G06C\u00f4te d'Ivoire use (using wooden models of penises) is generally also part of these meetings; - peer education through recruitment of sex workers who perform outreach to other sex workers in their places of work, as well as organizing educationalmeetings; training sessions for peer educators are held every two months atthe Clinique de Confiance. 2. Promotion of and access to condoms. The programme distributes free condoms in places where the sex trade is carried out and in some healthcentres. It has also attempted to involve sex workers and hotel or bar ownersin this distribution. 3. Access to STD care and to voluntary HIV counselling and testing. The Clinique de Confiance offers free STD examinations and treatment specificallyfor sex workers. As well as the services at the Clinique de Confiance, the programme helps direct sex workers to health centres that are familiar with and adapted to theirneeds and specific conditions. The PPP has also created a network of publicand private medical partners who are capable of responding to the needs ofsex workers. Outcomes A variety of outcomes have been studied, although data are not complete. In the year 1996, for instance, 176 educational meetings were held, withparticipation as follows: 2,673 men, 1,886 sex workers, 1,550 women whowere not sex workers, and 1,213 children. Between October 1992 andDecember 1998, the Clinique de Confiance was visited at least once by 5,218sex workers. An important outcome is the information produced by the programme's KAP research, which was first carried out in 1991 and has been repeated at two-year intervals since then. As well, the Clinique de Confiance has been able toprovide annual data on prevalence of HIV and other STDs since 1992. Simplefollow-up and evaluation techniques have been in place since 1994 in order toprovide programme impact data to funding agencies. Evaluation Findings An evaluation carried out in 1999 focused on three main sets of indicators: 1. Coverage of the programme among target groups. Between 1993 and 1995, awareness among sex workers of the Clinique de Confiance's existencegrew from 15% to 38%, while the proportion of women who had actuallyvisited it grew from 7% to 21%. By 1997, about half of sex workers knewabout it, and some 37% had visited the clinic - an impressive fact given the mobility of many of the women and a high rate of exit and entry into the sextrade. The fact that many more women knew about it than had visited it waspartly explained by the difficulty of getting transportation to the clinic, and ofarranging education sessions at times that suit women who work all night.Another factor is that of priorities: many of the women recognize theimportance of sexual health, but are more concerned with the basic issues ofsurvival - having enough food for themselves and their family, finding and keeping a place to live, and so on. The mobility of the sex worker population/G08/G07 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSC\u00f4te d'Ivoire explained the finding that only one-quarter of the women trained as peer educators before 1996 actually participated during 1996 in preventionactivities. It was also found that most peer educators had little sense of\"ownership\" of the programme and took relatively limited roles in its activities. 2. Knowledge and behaviour of participants. The KAP studies over time showed improved knowledge of the modes of HIV transmission and greateruse of condoms in the general population, but indicated consistently moreknowledge and safer behaviour among women who had had contact with theprogramme (e.g., self-reporting about condom use with clients, understandingof modes of transmission, etc.). 3. Prevalence levels of HIV and STDs among women coming for their first consultation at the Clinique de Confiance. Prevalence of HIV and some otherSTDs among sex workers has fallen in Abidjan since 1992. While it is notcertain exactly how much of this was due to the PPP and how much to otherprevention efforts happening at the same time, and despite some problems ofselection bias in the data collection, enough difference can be measuredbetween participant and non-participants to strongly indicate an independentand positive impact of the programme. As in studies in other parts of the world, PPP and Projet Retro-Ci found that measures of levels of knowledge and behaviour, as well as prevalence ofinfection, were strongly affected by the proportion of migrants in thepopulation. The reduced proportion of foreign sex workers in Abidjan, whichbegan during the mid-1990s, may have been an important factor in thereduced levels of HIV. The evaluation also noted the exceptional longevity of the programme (in operation continuously since 1991), due to its ability to find support from andcooperation with a variety of national and international partners. Lessons Learned The programme and its various components highlight a variety of useful lessons. The overall lesson appears to be that, when founded on properlycollected research data to assess needs and conditions, a community-basedIEC strategy can be effective in reducing HIV prevalence and increasingcondom use among sex workers. An extremely important lesson is the value of cooperation between different organizations in order to get the greatest value out of existing resources. Theprogramme allows coordination between local communities, governmentprogrammes, NGOs, and international organizations that reflects the strengthsof each. Such coordination avoids duplication of effort and provides the bestguarantee of sustainability.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G08/G08 Sexually transmitted diseases In the last decade, sufficient knowledge and expertise have been gathered in the fight against HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) toenable effective prevention and care interventions to be established. Nosingle strategy will work on its own, and no one nation can work in isolation inthe fight against these diseases. A unified approach based on soundprinciples needs to be implemented globally, regionally, and locally. WHO hasestimated that in 1995 around 340 million new cases of curable STDsoccurred globally in men and women 15 -49 years old. In developing countries, STDs and their complications rank in the top five diseasecategories for which adults seek health care. In women of childbearing age,disease and death/healthy life lost due to STDs - even excluding HIV - are second only to maternal causes. The scale of the problem is too great to bedealt with in STD centres alone, and steps must be taken to expand andintegrate STD management in primary health and other health centres. STDs continue to spread, and their complications and long-term health effects continue to be a burden on individuals and communities for many reasons.Many cases are asymptomatic, and there is widespread ignorance of STDs'causes, symptoms, cures, and possible consequences. Many people showingsymptoms are reluctant to seek health care, and find it difficult to notify theirspouse or sex partner(s) of their health status. As well, in many places STDservices are unavailable or are unsuitable for many potential clients, andprescribed treatments are often substandard. However, effective prevention and control of STDs can be achieved using a combination of responses, including a \"public health package. \" STD service delivery should be expanded to include the following components: /G01 promotion of safer sex behaviour /G01 condom programming, encompassing a full range of activities from promotion to the planning and management of supplies and distribution /G01 promotion of health care -seeking behaviour /G01 integration of STD control into primary health care, reproductive health care facilities, private clinics, and other health institutions /G01 specific services for populations with high risk behaviours for acquiring and transmitting STD and HIV infections /G01 comprehensive case management of STDs /G01 prevention and care of congenital syphilis and /G01 early detection of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections./G08/G09 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSInternational West African Project to Combat AIDS: STD control strategies (International) Starting Year : 1996 Main Topic Area : Sexually transmitted diseases Other Topic Areas : Community mobilization \u007f Migration \u007f Sex workers and clients Contact Person : Robert Beaudry, Project Officer (Quebec) Site : Inc.

The CCISD has three institutional partners in theproject: the Unit \u00e9 de sant\u00e9 internationale de l Montr \u00e9al Universitaire deSherbrooke (CRC-CHUS), Saint- Sacrement (CRHSS). Funding Overall project funding of CDN$ 24 million comes from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), but a wide variety of financialbackers have been found for specific activities in different countries.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G08/G0AInternational Objectives The overall goals are to reduce the transmission of HIV through syndromic control of STDs and to ensure effective and sustainable HIV and STD controlthrough: /G02 reinforcing primary and community health networks /G02 giving priority to groups likely to adopt high-risk behaviours /G02 encouraging stakeholders to work on a self-financing basis. The general objectives are: to help national teams to develop effective and efficient interventions, based on scientifically valid data used in a public healthapproach; and to set up mechanisms that will ensure permanent availability ofessential drugs in the treatment of STDs, in a context of self-financing byusers. Background The project supports a number of basic health services located in underprivileged urban areas and along migratory routes. Activities centre onpersonnel training and STD control, particularly by ensuring access toessential drugs, by providing training, and by supporting communityorganizations. The project operates within the framework of interventionstrategies designed at the regional level but does so through interventionsimplemented and managed at the national level in each of the above-mentioned African countries. In the field, the project collaborates with the Ministries of Health of the countries involved, the Canadian embassies, and various institutions andNGOs. It coordinates its activities with those of numerous financial backers. Aregional office has been set up in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The nationalteams are connected to each other (and to the rest of the world) through theInternet. Main Activities Because of its complexity, this multicountry, multicomponent project is difficult to summarize (for more detail, readers are directed to the implementer 's website and project documents). However, for purposes of this booklet, thefollowing activity areas are noted: 1. STD control strategies and essential drugs management The focus is on technical aspects of STD case management:- an assessment of STD flowcharts already in use in each country and recommendations to improve them, if necessary - validation of the choices involved in the flowcharts through a regional study on the etiology of urethritis and genital ulcer cases, and a studylimited to two countries on in vitro susceptibility of STD pathogens(Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ) to various antimicrobials/G09/G0B Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSInternational - in four countries of the project (Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Guinea Conakry), a study of the quality of drugs used in treating STDs, in order toprovide decision-makers with information that will enable them to betterdirect their action regarding essential drugs availability. The final reportwas disseminated in October 1998. In countries where it has been decided to target sex workers specifically, studies on STD prevalence among sex workers are to be carried out beforeand after the intervention, this certainly being one of the best guides forestimating orders of medicines and laboratory supplies. Regarding the management of essential STD drugs, project activities include:- assessment of management and essential drugs self-financing methods already in use in the intervention units, followed by individualrecommendations to improve them - preparation of management training material where necessary and helping national coordinators to provide training - for each country, analysis of essential drugs supply mechanisms and networks, tariff structures, and ways to reduce the cost of medicines. 2. Community participation The community participation regional component ensures the promotion and acceptability of STD control among the populations served by health centres,in particular groups and individuals most exposed to STDs and AIDS. Theparticipation of these high-risk groups in information and education is intendednot only to stimulate the demand for STD/AIDS health care services, but alsoto support the self-development of these populations and encourage decision-making as regards the adoption of preventive measures. Therefore, thoseorganizations must participate in analysing health problems and planningSTD/AIDS control activities with health facility officials. Activities that are supported to achieve this participation include:- training trainers in the areas of planning, project management, and communication; they, in turn, train national partners, including officials incharge of community support - supervising officials in charge of community support with regard to the planning of their interventions, and the management, monitoring, andassessment of small initiatives - developing management tools for small initiatives - sharing experience and information through meetings, visits, and relevant publications pertaining to the theme - supporting the implementation of collaboration and consultation mechanisms among relay organizations, beneficiaries, and national andlocal officials in charge of health facilities - looking for additional funds to finance small initiatives.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G09/G02International 3. Monitoring The monitoring staff is in charge of assessing the quality of STD case management in more than 487 facilities currently supported by the variouscountry-based components, as well as monitoring the outcome indicators(PIs) selected for the entire project. To carry out the monitoring, a simplebaseline surveillance system has been set up that includes a limited numberof variables. Data are collected regularly to assess the achievement ofplanned results, in particular in terms of training and community support. Several steps remain in terms of integration of national health information systems. First, the various registers and/or files set up in the facilities by theproject need to be analysed. These are then to be compared to the sametools in the public facilities under the direct supervision of the national officials.National coordinators (NCs) and an official identified by the health authoritiesof each country need to confer about the possible harmonization of thoseinstruments and field practices. The goal is for these individuals to agree onthe remedial measures to be carried out and/or adaptations to be made inorder to enable the national officials of all the intervention countries toeffectively adopt the tools and the project's activity monitoring system beforethe end of the project. Outcomes Project reports indicate the following raw measures of outputs, which can be taken to indicate the scope of the project's coverage. As of December 1999,the total cumulative number of patients managed for an STD under thesupervision of the project since its beginning was 146,460, of whom 75 percent were female. Some 627 health facilities had received support. A total of 1,663 community workers and 3,712 peer educators had received training, while 5,747 healthworkers had received training and were being supervised on a regular basis.Further, a total of 325 community projects had been completed or were inprogress. On the prevention side, an estimated 453,421 persons had beenreached by prevention activities associated with the project. Evaluation Findings In terms of results related to the objective of improving the quality of STD care and control, the January -September 1998 assessment indicated that the percentage of treatments that complied with national flowcharts had increasedin comparison with the first 9 months of activity of the Project (April - December 1997). All the intervention countries have conducted PI6/PI7surveys at the beginning of Year 2 (except in Ghana, where only oneassessment has been made) in order to determine the progress made, sincethe first assessment, both in terms of the percentages of STD patientsmanaged according to national standards (PI6 indicator) and of STD patientsencouraged to use condoms and refer their partners for treatment (PI7indicator). There has been an increase in scores at the regional level from 8%to 57% for PI6 and from 15% to 49% for PI7 in the supported facilities. Suchan increase confirms that health facilities are providing better STD case/G09/G03 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSInternational management, and the \"treatment\" aspect is the one for which the project has had the best results. The percentage of patients who have a complete history has changed little (83% to 89%) and the percentage of patients who have a completeexamination has increased moderately (51% to 78%). The percentage ofeffective treatments has more than doubled, rising from 27% before theintervention to 73% after one year of activities. As well, the percentages of cases effectively treated are higher if one takes into account those treatments that comply with national flowcharts as well as\"prescriptions that do not comply but are considered to be effective\": 96% forcases of urethral discharge, 89% for genital ulcers, 81% for cases of vaginaldischarge, 73% for lower abdominal pain, and 83% overall at the regionallevel. Lessons Learned Among the many lessons learned in the course of the project, a main one is that syndromic control of STDs in population groups with high-risk behavioursis feasible within existing primary health care services (i.e., without creating anew service delivery infrastructure) on a drug cost-recovery basis. However, anumber of elements are necessary for the success of this approach: - health-seeking behaviours (notably, where potential clients go for STD services) change substantially from one region to another, so primaryassessment of health-seeking behaviours is essential - community participation activities must be carried out to stimulate the use of STD services, and for information, education, and communication (IEC)to be delivered effectively - training at the field level of health care workers must be kept very basic, and there should be consistent follow-up by supervisors in order for skillsto be maintained - consistent field-level training and supervision must be matched by advocacy at central (particularly Ministry of Health) agencies if ongoinguse of proper algorithms is to be sustained - the syndromic approach must be part of all health school curricula - use of generic drugs can and must be adopted throughout the whole of health services - planning and managerial capacity-building must be built into projects aimed at improving procurement, distribution, and use of essential drugs. All the country-based teams were made aware of the importance of keeping a common pace and level of quality. Baseline surveillance is currently functionalin all countries, albeit to varying degrees according to the age of thesupported facilities. Baseline surveillance enables the various national projectstaffs to monitor over time (with the intervention of the Project) thepercentages of STD cases correctly treated and to indirectly assess theSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G09/G04International application by trained health care workers of the syndromic approach to STD case management.

This includes detaileddescriptions of activities in each country and contact details for nationalpartners.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G09/G06 United Nations Theme Groups on HIV/AIDS The ECOSOC resolution establishing UNAIDS called for the setting up of UN Theme Groups as the principal vehicle for carrying out the mandate of theJoint Programme at country level. Under the aegis of the UN's ResidentCoordinator stationed in each country, the Theme Groups would \"ensure effective and coordinated support by the UN system to the national AIDSprogramme (i.e. the national response). \" At the same time they would \"help the UN system integrate more effectively its efforts with national coordinationmechanisms \" and \"whenever possible, facilitate the coordination of other external support to the national programme. \" While core membership consists of representatives of the seven (originally six) UNAIDS cosponsors and other UN system organizations, the resolutionspecified that Theme Groups on HIV/AIDS could be expanded to includerepresentatives of government and other international organizations, includingdonor agencies, and that non-governmental organizations representingpersons living with HIV/AIDS might also be invited to participate. TheECOSOC resolution thereby recognized the diversity of country situations andallowed a great degree of flexibility, notably concerning the membership ofTheme Groups. The many different effective models of Theme Group operations testify to the variety of settings and contexts within which Theme Groups have evolved oroperate. Expanded Theme Groups, rather than those limited to onlycosponsors and UN system organizations, are now the rule rather than the exception. /G03 In the majority of countries, AIDS as a theme is addressed not only by the UN Theme Group. Other mechanisms for doing so include Technical WorkingGroups (TWGs), consultative policy advisory groups, and working groups onspecific HIV/AIDS-related issues or areas such as advocacy, mother-to-childtransmission, children and young people, and so on. In many instances theTWGs initially brought together the technical focal points of the UN systemagencies to advise the UN TG on the system 's programmatic support to the national response. But they have almost invariably expanded to includenational and international partners and are often de facto the premier forums /G03 The term \"Theme Group on HIV/AIDS \" is often used interchangeably with the term \"UN Theme Group.\" The latter can refer to any group or groups convened by the UN system, specifically by a designated Chair from the UN system. Such a Theme Group may include aforum for Heads of Agencies or their representatives as well as one that is \"expanded \" to government and other national and international partners. As such, the UN Theme Group isthe expression of UNAIDS in-country. It is a mechanism that is based on the ResidentCoordinator system, with the UN Resident Coordinator being responsible for its effectivefunctioning. Its primary function is to ensure a coordinated response by the UN system onHIV/AIDS programmes and policies./G09/G07 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSfor information exchange and, importantly, for collaborative or joint programming. In contrast, the forum of Heads of Agencies has shown itself tobe particularly effective and valuable for policy and advocacy purposes. Coordination of the national response remains the responsibility of the member state , and there should never be any intention to substitute for, or supplant, that ultimate responsibility. However, the strength of each country'sNational Programme on HIV/AIDS and its capacity to coordinate the responseare critical in determining the way that given UN Theme Groups function. Incountries with a strong national coordinating body on HIV/AIDS, there willoften already exist an expanded forum for national and international partners,including the UN system. Where national coordinating capacity is weak or ifthe government so desires, the UN system can continue to play a key role infacilitating regular consultations among internal and external partners. In suchcases, the UN Theme Group may assume the responsibility of convening anexpanded Theme Group on HIV/AIDS.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G09/G08C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Expanded Theme Group (C \u00f4te d'Ivoire) Starting Year : 1995 Main Topic Area : Theme groups - UN system at country level Other Topic Areas : National strategic planning \u007f NGOs and networks Contact Person : Mamadou Diallo Phone: +225 33 71 54 \u00f4te d'Ivoire made up the original members of the Theme Group, which has since been joined by many otherorganizations (see Background). Funding UNAIDS cosponsors working in C \u00f4te d'Ivoire contribute (see Main Activities) to a common fund administered by the UNDP office. Objectives UN Theme Groups on HIV/AIDS have four main functions: - advocacy for a coordinated, adequately resourced multisectoral response observing high technical, ethical, and strategic standards - coordination of efforts by cosponsors, other UN agencies, and bilateral and multilateral donors to support the national response - technical collaboration to support the capacity of governments, communities, and other partners to manage their responses to HIV/AIDS - policy-creation and promotion of research into new or improved measures against the epidemic. Background C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's Theme Group was created in December 1995 by the UNAIDS cosponsors, and quickly allied itself with the country's National Programmeagainst AIDS, STDs, and Tuberculosis (PNLS/MST/TUB). Starting in 1997,groups from civil society began to take their place in the Theme Group,particularly NGOs working in the social, development, and health fields, andgroups representing people living with or affected by HIV/AIDS./G09/G09 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSC\u00f4te d'Ivoire In 1998, the Theme Group expanded in order to better reflect the expanded response being carried out in C \u00f4te d'Ivoire and to provide better coordination of human, material, and financial resources in that response. The newmembers of the expanded Theme Group included: - other UN agencies represented in Abidjan, including the Food and Agriculture Organization, International Labour Office, United Nations Office forProject Services, and United Nations Industrial Development Organization - bilateral and multilateral partners including the Canadian, Belgian, French, German, and US cooperation missions, and that of the European Union. Responsibility for chairing the Theme Group revolves among the heads of the cosponsors and lasts six months. Meetings of the core group are heldmonthly, but may be convoked by the chair as needed. The expanded groupmeets every two months. Ongoing financing for the Theme Group is provided by annual membership fees (set at US$ 5,600 in 1998). This has permitted the hiring of an executiveassistant for the Country Programme Adviser, purchase of equipment, andfinancing of certain partners' participation at international conferences. Main Activities The Theme Group is not an executive but a coordinating entity. Major areas of activity include: 1. Support for the National Programme against AIDS, STDs, and TuberculosisThe executive director of C \u00f4te d'Ivoire's PNLS/MST/TUB was an early member of the Theme Group, and its technical director attends the meetingsof the Theme Group's Technical Working Group (TWG), which is chaired bythe UNAIDS Country Programme Adviser. Among other initiatives, the ThemeGroup and the National Programme are working together on the country'sDrug Access Initiative, aimed at improving the provision of HIV-related drugsto persons living with HIV/AIDS. 2. Support to and coordination with other partnersThe expanded Theme Group provides a mechanism by which a formal relationship is maintained with important bilateral or multilateral actors in C \u00f4te d'Ivoire's AIDS reponse, and by which the Theme Group can be kept aware of their projects. Examples include: - the microbicide research project of the Institue of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium - the French government's Solidarity Fund, along with various French- supported research projects, including those on the use of cotrimoxazoleagainst opportunistic infections, use of AZT against mother-to-childtransmission, and several social science projects - USAID's involvement with Projet Retro-Ci's HIV testing and research work (see summary of PPP Project, C \u00f4te d'Ivoire). 3. Support to national strategic planningThe Theme Group provided expertise and support in the elaboration of the country's National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS, 2000 -2004, and wasSummary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G09/G0AC\u00f4te d'Ivoire instrumental in accessing UNAIDS' Strategic Planning and Development Funds to help finalize the plan. 4. Creating a common approach between agenciesThe Theme Group in C \u00f4te d'Ivoire benefits from the personal attendance of the UN agency heads at the monthly core group meetings. From time to time,the Theme Group sponsors retreats during which the agency chiefs (andsometimes other partners) can work more profoundly on specific issues oractivities. This was the case with the country's National Strategic Plan in 1999and with the country's participation in the International Partnership againstAIDS in Africa. Outcomes The C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Theme Group has been successful in bringing about the following: - cohesiveness among cosponsors, and effective participation among UN agencies with a part to play in the national response - strong awareness of HIV/AIDS issues among agency heads- a close and effective working relationship with the Theme Groups' major national partner, the PNLS/MST/TUB, and its executive director - integration of civil society in the workings of the Theme Group, with benefits to all partners. In particular, the Theme Group has been able to formulate and adopt an Integrated Work Plan (19 April 2000). The Integrated Work Plan was theresult of a strategic planning process financed by UNAIDS. The TechnicalWorking Group (TWG) was chaired by the Country Programme Adviser andattended by the UN agency focal points and the technical director of thePNLS/MST/TUB. The TWG met six times, using the PNLS/MST/TUB 's operational plan for 2000 -2001 as a base for analysis in order to identify ways the Theme Group could support the plan, either jointly or according to thespecific mandates of each agency. Joint activities were listed, budgetsspecified, and lead organizations formally designated. As C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is currently directed by a transition government and the traditional international funders have frozen their activities, the planconcentrates on the following: - vigorous advocacy at both the political (workshops on AIDS and development for political journalists) and institutional level (seminars forgovernment staff and meetings with Ministers) in order to make the subject ofAIDS a central issue in electoral campaigns and to set the stage for effectivedecentralization of action - reinforcing the capacity of AIDS-related associations and NGOs through training, equipment, and help to coordinate their activities - reinforcing the institutional capacity of PNLS/MST/TUB, through training of personnel, decentralisation of coordination and financing, and creating adatabase as an important tool for improving administration of activities - beginning to mobilize the private sector and civil society as a whole in order to make up for internal and external deficits in resources./G0A/G0B Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSC\u00f4te d'Ivoire Among other features, the plan creates a framework for project proposals in order to help all members (especially those who are not UNAIDS cosponsors)to make proposals for AIDS projects in their sector. The plan specifies thatjoint evaluations must be done of all interventions, and spells out guidelinesfor this. These include carrying out midpoint and final evaluations with theparticipation of representatives from at least two agencies other than theinitiator. It also requires that activity reports about each project be given to theTechnical Working Group meetings, and that their conclusions be presentedto the Theme Group. Some problems or weaknesses remain to be solved. Lack of clarity in terms of reference have created confusion about membership in the Theme Group andthe Technical Working Group; lack of common procedures for disbursement offunds by the various partners (cosponsors as well as civil society partners)has posed difficulties; mechanisms for follow-up or evaluation are as yet intheir early stages and need to be strengthened considerably. Also, somemember agencies have not entirely accepted or understood the coordinatedway of working promoted by the Theme Group, and continue to carry outsome activities without reference to the national response or agreed planningmechanisms. Lessons Learned The C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Theme Group provides a number of important lessons regarding the potential of the UN theme group mechanism in countries facing(as C\u00f4te d'Ivoire does) a mature epidemic. One of the most important is that of establishing close links with the statutory national authorities responsible for AIDS, in this case the Ministry of Healthand the National Programme against AIDS, STDs, and Tuberculosis. Thelinks are not just formal but based on real participation at different levels. Atthe highest level, the executive director of the PNLS/MST/TUB has sat as amember of the Theme Group almost since its beginning. At the working level,PNLS/MST/TUB technical director participates as a member of the ThemeGroup's Technical Working Group, and is thus kept abreast of all researchand intervention activities. The benefits go both ways, for the nationalauthorities have been able to contribute their own considerable knowledge tothe Theme Group, and to provide services such as transportation, workingspace, and logistic support for workshops. A highly practical lesson can be learned from the Theme Group's financing arrangements, which, by levying membership fees, ensure its ongoingsustainability. This also provides an excellent indicator of the level of\"ownership \" and sense of commitment felt by the member agencies. The problems the Theme Group has experienced with members' terms of reference and with the members' various disbursement procedures underlinethe importance of high administrative standards in all the workings of theTheme Group. Administrative arrangements don't just happen naturally; theyneed to be planned and implemented with care if the Theme Group is toachieve its full potential. Members must therefore be fully familiar with theGuide pratique (procedures guide) created by the group for exactly this purpose.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G0A/G02C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Other important lessons include: - the motivation and personal participation of the agency chiefs are essential to the success of Theme Groups - nomination of focal points must be formal, and must be followed by regular and active participation in the Technical Work Group - involving the other UN agencies in addition to the cosponsors is a useful practice and one that increases the dynamism of the Theme Group - funding of strategic planning and/or acceleration of programmes serves to increase the Theme Group 's credibility.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G0A/G04 World of work: employers and workers With the rising prevalence of HIV/AIDS, employers are increasingly concerned about the impact of the disease on their organizations. At the same time,workers' representative organizations are deeply disturbed by the epidemic 's impact on their members. These concerns are well founded. At the broadestlevel, businesses are dependent on the strength and vitality of the economiesin which they operate. HIV/AIDS raises the costs of doing business, reducesproductivity, and lowers overall demand for goods and services. It thereforemakes sense to invest in prevention, care, and support programmes to stemdeclining business productivity and profitability. The world of work faces enormous challenges in responding to AIDS. For the most part, business managers want to do the right thing for their employees,but when it comes to AIDS they often feel they don't know how, or are afraid itwill be too expensive. Businesses may be reluctant to set up workplaceHIV/AIDS programmes because they feel they lack the resources, do nothave adequate in-house knowledge, or consider the matter too sensitive.They may also lack links with the wider community and thus miss out on waysin which community and other outside groups could help them in dealing withHIV/AIDS issues - and vice versa. Many companies setting up workplace programmes do so without clear policies on how to deal with HIV/AIDS. Evenwhen companies do have policies, these are often unconnected to nationalHIV/AIDS policies, or else are limited in scope or short-term in nature.Educational programmes, for instance, often consist of single-sessioncourses, with poor and unsustained results. Effective workplace programmes can be set up by a company at a fraction of the current, rising financial cost of AIDS to the business. Companies shouldnot wait for the government or health sector to take action for them. In agrowing number of countries, including Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, and theUnited States, companies have formed business coalitions to pool resourcesand help each other to respond better to the crises in their workplaces andcommunities. Workplace HIV/AIDS programmes are most effective when their planning and monitoring processes involve representatives from a wide range of sectors.Thus, there should be included representatives from the workforce, frommanagement, from the company's health clinic (if there is one), as well as arepresentative concerned with human rights issues and representatives fromthe wider community, including non-governmental organizations, especially ifthe company does not have an in-house clinic or support service. While mandatory HIV testing is strongly discouraged, employers may choose to offer voluntary, informed, and confidential testing and counselling foremployees and their partners as part of the employee education programme./G0A/G05 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSThe recommended components of a workplace AIDS programme are: /G01 an equitable set of policies that are communicated to all staff and are properly implemented /G01 ongoing formal and informal education for all staff on HIV/AIDS /G01 availability of condoms /G01 diagnosis, treatment, and management of sexually transmitted diseases, for employees and their sex partners /G01 HIV/AIDS voluntary testing, counselling, care, and support services for employees and their families. The effectiveness and sustainability of workplace HIV/AIDS programmes are enhanced if they are periodically monitored, re-evaluated, and updated. Aswell, workplace programmes should be constantly evolving. Knowledge ofemployee culture - and of such factors as the incidence of STDs, violence (including rape), and drug and alcohol use among employees and in theircommunity - is essential for making programmes as relevant and effective as possible.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G0A/G06Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers' Union AIDS Control Programme (Zimbabwe) Starting Year : 1986 Main Topic Area : World of work: employers and workers Other Topic Areas : Sexually transmitted diseases \u007f Male condoms \u007f Community mobilization \u007f Agricultural/ Rural Development \u007f Local responses to HIV/AIDS Implementers The Union (CFU) is the coordinating body for Zimbabwe's commercial farming sector, which groups 73 farmers'associations within the 8 regions of the country. Funding Overall programme funding is currently provided by the Royal Netherlands Government. Earlier funding was provided by USAID through Family HealthInternational and AIDSTECH. Other contributions in cash, kind, or technicalsupport have been provided by the Family AIDS Caring Trust, theInternational Tobacco Growers Assocation/Zimbabwe Tobacco Association,National AIDS Coordination Programme, UNICEF, and the ZimbabweNational Planning Council. Objectives The main programme goal is to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS and STDs among commercial farmers, farm workers, and their families through thereduction of high-risk sexual behaviour. Specific objectives are to: - increase the knowledge of HIV/AIDS among the target population- increase the target population's perception of the risk of acquiring HIV/AIDS- reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases through early symptom recognition and promotion of early treatment-seeking behaviour/G0A/G07 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSZimbabwe - ensure condom availability and accessibility and promote condom use - enhance parent/teacher-to-child communication- implement community and home-based care for the terminally ill- train volunteers in bereavement, marriage, and youth counselling. Background Zimbabwe's agricultural sector contributes about 20 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. An estimated two million people (including children)live in full family situations on commercial farms where basic infrastructure(housing, water, and so on) are provided by the commercial farmers. The CFU AIDS Control Programme began in 1986, following the earliest reporting of AIDS in the country, with a pilot project on the farm of the latePeter Fraser-Mackenzie in Mutorashanga. The project was extended toMashonaland, where five farmers' wives volunteered to work as coordinatorsfor what were then mostly condom distribution campaigns. In 1995 the CFUreceived funding from Family Health International and expanded activities toinclude communication interventions for behavioural change and extensivepeer education. Since then, the programme has expanded beyond thecommercial farming sector to communal, resettlement, and small-scalefarming areas, to HIV/AIDS education in schools in connection with theMinistry of Education and UNICEF, and also to training rural police and peopleworking in rural agri-business. The project has a decentralized structure, with central administration comprising only a project manager and two deputy project managers and theCFU's chief accountant and book-keeper. The coordinators of the project arefarmers' wives who volunteer to do HIV/AIDS activities. The coordinators havevarying backgrounds, including nursing, police work, occupational therapy,and counselling. There are no formal qualifications except the commitment tovolunteer time and energy to organize training courses, and to distributeHIV/AIDS literature and condoms using personal cars, farm lorries, andtelephones and faxes. Main Activities The guiding strategy behind the programme is behaviour-change communication through peer education. The main activities under theresponsibility of the coordinators (who themselves receive training and haveformal meetings and follow-up) are: 1. Training of peer trainers Trainers are selected from farming community members. Selection criteria included respect within the community and sufficient education to read andunderstand HIV/AIDS materials (including good ability to read and writeEnglish) and pass them on to their peers. Peer educators tend to be middlemanagers on farms, storekeepers, farm and rural school teachers, police,telephone operators, and so on. Training materials and curriculum areprovided by the Family AIDS Counselling Trust (FACT) in Mutare, andcourses cover all basic information on HIV/AIDS and STDs, counselling andcommunications skills, condom negotiation, reporting techniques, home-Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G0A/G08Zimbabwe based care, spiritual aspects, and so forth. Trainers are taught by CFU coordinators, experienced trainers, and invited experts. Trainers conduct follow-up visits for peer educators and report to coordinators. All are volunteers who use their bicycles in their monitoring andsupervisory role. Some of the bicycles were donated by USAID and the Dutchgovernment, and some farmers associations. 2. Peer education Individuals chosen to be peer educators are respected men and women selected by their coworkers, or people who volunteered. Already credible asknowledgeable individuals and role models, they receive training from thecoordinators and trainers in groups of 15 comprising both men and women.Some of the training facilities, food, transportation, and firewood arecontributed by the farmers. Peer education activities include: giving condomdemonstrations, distributing information materials, performing educationaldramas, conducting informal group discussions about HIV/AIDS, showingvideos, providing individual counselling, teaching home-based care, andreferring people to care facilities. An important activity is providingcompassionate support to people living with HIV/AIDS. Most of the work isdone during lunch breaks, after work, and over weekends. Follow-up andsupervision of peer educators is carried out by coordinators and peer trainersat contact points including churches, farm compounds, streets, and drinkingplaces. Peer educators are not paid, but receive certificates, badges, andoccasionally T-shirts. A major motivation is provided in biannual follow-up/refresher courses, which include social activities, good food, and thechance to share experiences. 3. Home-based care and counselling Trainers and peer educators provide these services whenever possible, and increasingly the commercial farmers take the responsibility of providingresources and food for sick farm workers. 4. Distribution of condoms Condoms are provided free by the Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (courtesy of the British government), and it is the responsibility ofeach farmer to ensure that condoms are available on their farms. To increaseaccessibility to condoms (and so that people don't have to request themdirectly from their employers), many outlets on farms have been establishedsuch as farm stores, garages, post offices, butchers, and meeting halls. 5. Advocacy Though careful to position itself as complementary to the government's HIV/AIDS efforts, the CFU carries out advocacy to influence governmentpolicy or legislation related to health care, drug distribution, orphan support,and other HIV-AIDS related issues. As well, the CFU maintains strong/G0A/G09 Issue 2 (September, 2000) UNAIDSZimbabwe networks with other NGOs and AIDS service organizations, and attends both national and international workshops, meetings, and conferences whenrelevant to its activities and objectives. Outcomes The project's 30 coordinators and 135 trainers have trained and supervised approximately 10,000 peer educators. Activities have been extended to 3,500farms in most parts of the country. The programme distributes approximately1.5 million condoms per quarter. The programme has produced an educational video called Jamie, the testimonial of a farmer's son succumbing to AIDS. Two others are inproduction, in English ( Listening and Learning from Youth ) and Shona. Evaluation Findings A KABP (knowledge, attitudes, behaviours, practices) study was carried out in 1997, and an end-of-funding evaluation in 1998. The evaluations both showedhigh HIV/AIDS knowledge of between 80 and 84 per cent for adults and youth.Almost all respondents had heard about HIV/AIDS. Condom distribution wasgood on most farms, though on some the farmer was not always able toensure a constant supply. Focus group discussions found that condom use bywomen was much lower than that of men, owing to the stigma ofpromiscuousness that attached itself to women who provide condoms.Despite the behaviour change activities of the programme, the practice ofnon-regular sex partners was still a problem for both male and female farmworkers. Reasons included the context of seasonal inflow of workers, a harsheconomic climate and high unemployment rate (highly conducive to womenproviding \"survival sex\"), and certain social factors connected to ethnicity andreligion. A lack of baseline data hampers more in-depth evaluation of programme impact on behaviour or disease incidence. Lessons Learned The organization of a programme by commercial farmers has proved an effective access point for HIV/AIDS interventions for the two million peopleliving and working in the sector. In particular, the programme benefits stronglyfrom the sector's existing infrastructure (communications, transportation,organization, and so forth). The CFU notes that its success has brought anunfortunate by-product: other organizations and individuals attempting toimplement their own AIDS-related activities on commercial farms, whileignoring to a large extent the desperate needs of the even greater ruralpopulation. Other lessons learned include:- The decentralization of the programme appears to have contributed to its ability to cover so many of the commercial farms in the country.Administrative costs are kept low by maintaining the smallest centralorganization possible, and \"borrowing\" the CFU's own accounting and otherservices.Summary Booklet of Best Practices in Africa /G0A/G0AZimbabwe - The fact that the programme is based on voluntarism has proved a benefit in that instability of funding does not affect the work carried out on the \"frontlines.\" At the same time, coordinators are mindful of the dangers of burn-out,and the importance meetings, training follow-up, and social events forvolunteer motivation. - Better methods must be found to increase women's empowerment and self- esteem, since the traditional norm of men making most sexual decisions(particularly whether or not to use a condom) remains pervasive. - The openness encouraged by the programme's design for group discussions and information distribution appears to have had spinoff benefits both withinand outside the target population. These are noted in the greatercohesiveness of different groups of people within farming communities,increasing numbers of volunteers for the programme from communal farmingareas (i.e., external to the commercial farms), and greater grassroots politicalawareness.
