The Pharmacy team played a major role, in addition to providing their usual service to the Trust and running a unique specialist prescriber information line for doctors and prescribers across the UK. \"From early days of Covid 19, the ever changing terrain of new challenges, grim news and personal tragedy, I look back to the hope provided by the vaccine vials that we had to carry like a candle in the wind. I look back and I appreciate more and more the human spirit and the NHS.I am so proud of my own little contribution and what we have achieved together in SLAM. I look back at the telling exhaustion in my eyes, understanding that in all this, in my role it was absolutely vital we kept an eye on quality.\" Wellington Kapfunde, Matron It felt really great at the beginning when people were so excited, relieved, and overwhelmed that they were having their first vaccination. So many colleagues have been involved in the vaccination programme - including the vaccinators, admin staff, pharmacists, and estates. Everyone has worked so hard and so well together. Jill Tedder, Business Operations Lead \"We take calls from across the country and staff from acute hospitals asked us for advice about patients who were very unwell with Covid-19 and taking mental health medication. At the Trust our team took calls from staff who had questions about the Covid-19 vaccine. We were able to allay their concerns.\" Petrina Douglas-Hall, Medicines Information Manager "}
