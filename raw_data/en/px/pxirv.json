Immunity is the general ability of the body to identify and remove foreign matter or organisms. Immunisation is the specific ability of the body to recognise and respond to a particular pathogen (disease-causing agent) and prevent it from causing life-threatening harm. Immunisation can occur naturally when the body is exposed to the pathogen, or via vaccination. Immunity is the body's general ability to prevent disease and stay healthy. Threats to the body can come in the form of toxins, foreign matter, or organisms that can cause harm. The immune system defends against all of these with various physical and chemical responses. Innate immunity includes the physical barriers that prevent harmful pathogens entering the body. It includes: These physical barriers remove or block all pathogens from harming the body via the same mechanism. Our innate immunity is the 'one-size-fits-all' part of our immune system and our first line of defence. Adaptive immunity is a customised and specific response to pathogens that have bypassed the barriers of the innate immune system. Viruses, bacteria and some toxins have signal molecules called 'antigens' in the cell wall or capsule, usually proteins or long chains of sugar molecules. During the adaptive immune response, your body learns to recognise these specific signal molecules and eliminate the pathogen associated with the signal molecule. White blood cells, known as 'B-cells', produce antibody proteins that bind specifically to the antigen of the foreign organism. This enables the body to recognise a pathogen and mount a faster response when it appears in the body. Once this adaptive immune response is activated, low levels of the antibody will circulate in the blood. If the antigen is detected, the B cells will scale up production of the specific antibody to increase levels and prevent the pathogen causing disease. The first time a new pathogen enters the body, it can take a few days for the adaptive response to activate. This primary immune response is often unable to prevent illness but it can help with a faster recovery. Once your body can recognise a pathogen, it responds much faster. During a second or third exposure to a particular pathogen, the immune response is swift and may even prevent illness. Immunisation is when your body is able to recognise and respond to a particular pathogen and either prevent the disease from becoming severe or prevent the disease from developing at all. Immunisation protects your body against infectious diseases, often caused by viruses or bacteria, that can lead to illness or fatality. When you are immunised for a particular antigen, your body is able to mount a secondary immune response which is swifter and more effective. This can prevent you from getting sick at all, or it can reduce the severity of the illness. Immunisation can occur through vaccination or through exposure to the specific antigen. There are two types of immunisation: Active immunisation is when the adaptive immune system of the body generates a specific response to a particular pathogen. Full protection takes time to develop, but is long lasting. Passive immunisation is when immunity is passed from one individual to another. For example, when mothers' breastfeed, antibodies are passed from mother to baby in breast milk. In some cases, antibodies are purified from blood donation and injected to provide rapid protection against disease. This type of immunisation will last a few weeks or months. Vaccination is the process of injecting a vaccine into your body or taking a vaccine dose. The purpose of vaccination is to provide immunisation in a safe way, without causing disease and with a lower threat of complications. This vaccine stimulates active immunisation through both the innate and adaptive immune response. After about two weeks, your immune system will be able to respond specifically to the disease that the vaccination intends to protect against. Some vaccinations require more than one dose to build up a stronger 'immune memory' of the particular antigen. Vaccination frequency depends on the pathogen itself \u2014 many viruses or bacteria will mutate over time to evade the immune system. The flu vaccination is required annually as the influenza virus mutates quickly. Immune memory is also affected by age. If the individual is exposed to the pathogen or disease-causing agent before receiving the second dose, they may still become sick as their immune system is prepared to only partially respond to the threat. Vaccination usually presents a much lower risk to your health than becoming infected with the pathogen will. Vaccinations may also provide stronger and longer-lasting protection than natural immunisation through infection. Learn more about COVID-19 Vaccination for Kids and Families.
