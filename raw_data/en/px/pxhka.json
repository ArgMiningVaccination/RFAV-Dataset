Molecular imaging in pancreatic cancer - A roadmap for therapeutic decisions http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23941833 Journal : Cancer Letters Institution(s) : Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Corresponding author(s) : Murray Korc Major finding : In addition to standard imaging techniques, experimental imaging strategies, such as those utilizing molecular probes, nanoparticle -based agents, and tagged antibodies are actively being explored experimentally. It is hoped that advances in these technologies will allow for detecting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at an early stage, and could serve to validate experimental therapies, rapidly identify non -responders, and assist in the design of novel therapeutic strategies tailored to the patient's molecular profile. Biomarkers for pancreatic cancer: promising new markers and options beyond CA 19 -9 http://www.ncbi.nlm .nih.gov/pubmed/23949878 Journal : Tumor Biology Institution(s) : Saint Barnabas Medical Center, Livingston, NJ and others Corresponding author(s) : Ronald Chamberlain Major finding : This review provides an insight into exciting new areas of pancreatic bio marker research such as salivary, pancreatic juice, and stool markers that can be used as a noninvasive test to identify pancreatic cancer. This manuscript also provides a discussion on newer biomarkers, the role of microRNAs, and pancreatic cancer proteom ics, which have the potential to identify a preferred tumor marker for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This review further elaborates on important genetic changes associated with the development and progression of pancreatic cancer that holds the key for the id entification of a sensitive biomarker and which could also serve as a therapeutic target.

Impact of tumor grade on pancreatic cancer prognosis: Validation of a novel TNMG staging system http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub med/23943022 Journal : Annals of Surgical Oncology Institution(s) : Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare System, Los Angeles, CA and others Corresponding author(s) : James Tomlinson Major finding : The authors were able to demonstrate that grade is one of the st rongest independent prognostic factors in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Restaging with their novel tumor, node, metastasis, grade (TNMG) system demonstrated improved prognostication. This system offers an effective and convenient way of adding grade to the current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.

Timely completion of scientifically r igorous cancer clinical trials: An unfulfilled priority http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23960175 Journal : Journal of Clinical Oncology Institution(s) : National Cancer Institute, National Ins titutes of Health, Bethesda, MD Corresponding author(s) : James Doroshow Major finding : This editorial discusses the findings described in the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's article above. Dr. Doroshow concludes that progress in facilitating the develop ment, activation, and evaluation of clinical investigations will fall short of improving the lives of cancer patients unless prioritized trials are completed on time and in a fashion that allows for a clear Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 1500 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 2 00 | Manhattan Beach, CA 90266 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org and scientifically rigorous interpretation of the ir results.

Subtype spec ific MEK - PI3 kinase feedback as a therapeutic target pancreatic adenocarcinoma http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23918833 Journal : Molecular Cancer Therapeutics Institution(s) : University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA Corresponding author(s) : W. Michael Korn Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated authors : o Eric Collisson, MD: 2012 Skip Viragh - Career Development Award o Andrew Ko, MD: 2003 Career Development Award Majo r finding : Knock -down of HER3 in epithelial -type and ZEB1 in mesenchymal -type PDA cell lines resulted in sensitization to the combination of MEK and EGFR inhibitors. Thus, the authors' findings suggest a new, subtype -specific and personalized therapeutic s trategy for pancreatic cancer. A phase I study of CD40 monoclonal antibody (CP -870,893) with gemcitabine http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23983255 Journal : Clinical Cancer Research Institution(s) : University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA and others Corresponding author(s) : Gregory Beatty Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated author : Bob Vonderheide, MD, DPhil: 2013 Tempur - Pedic - Inaugural Research Acceleration Network Gr ant in Memory of Tim Miller and Member, Scientific Advisory Board Major finding : CP-870,893, an agonist CD40 antibody, in combination with gemcitabine was well - tolerated and associated with anti -tumor activity in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcin oma.

This comprehensive FKBP5 resequencing study provides insights into the role of genetic variation in variation of gemcitabine response in pancreatic cancer. Phase II study of induction fixed -dose rate gemcitabi ne and bevacizumab followed radiotherapy Annals of Surgical Oncology Institution(s) : UPMC Pancreatic Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA and others Corresponding author(s) : Herbert Zeh and A. James Moser Major finding : Induction therapy with fixed -dose rate (FDR) gemcitabine (GEM) combined with the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab (BEV), followed by accelerated BEV/radiotherapy (RT), was well tole rated. Although both effectiveness criteria were achieved, survival outcomes were equivalent to published regimens.

Ultimately, to make progress, all preoperative clinical trial designs for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma should have standardized valid study endpoints, agreed on by conse nsus, which then allows meaningful comparisons between studies. In that regard, the authors look forward to the results of the intergroup Alliance (A0211101) trial, a pilot multi -institutional preoperative study in borderline patients, which will hopefully establish a research infrastructure upon which future trials can be based.

R. China and others Corresponding author(s) : Huaizhi Wang Major finding : Compared with resection, PD combined with reconstruction increased the incidence of postoperative complications. However, PD combined with vascular resection and reconstruction could achieve the complete removal of tumors without significantly increasing the mortality rate, and the median survival time was higher than that of patients who underwent palliative treatment. In addition, the two independent factors affecting the postoperative survival time were the degree of tumor differentiation and the presence or absence of postope rative complications.

These inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials to determine whether improv ements in therapeutic index within KRAS versus BRAF preclinical models translate to improved clinical responses in patients. Clinical and molecular characterization of HER2 amplified pancreatic cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24004612 Journal : Genome Medicine Institution(s) : Kinghorn Cancer Centre and Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia and others Corresponding author(s) : Andrew Biankin Major finding : 2% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and has distinct features with implications for clinical practice. The molecular heterogeneity of PDAC implies that even an incidence of 2% represents an attractive target for anti -HER2 therapies, as options for PDAC are limited. Recruiting patients based on HER2 amplification, rather than organ of origin, could make trials of anti -HER2 therapies feasible in less common cancer types.
