Enlightenment is perfect cleanliness. The dirtier the body, the busier the mind. When we partake in a cleanse, the mind slows. When our mind is quiet, our true Spirit is expressed. On the spiritual path, therefore, cleansing becomes a priority and healing plants become our Guru. Plants speak to us when we infuse our bodies with their energy, when we \"diet\" them. When we saturate our body with a plant, the plants whisper their secrets to us. Dieting a plant is Spiritual University. As we progress on our path and the mind slows, we begin to become aware of a subtle realm that is invisible to the busy mind. This realm interacts with us and we with it. As we begin to see more of what is, we are better able to live in harmony with the sea of energy that is all around us. Over time, clairvoyant vision develops and we obtain the power to manifest our dreams into being. And finally, we sit contently, harmoniously floating in the infinite nothing. Dieting a plant is an advanced Shamanic technique and should be done with expert guidance and supervision. A prerequisite of any diet is to cleanse all parts of the body, particularly the liver and colon. The food you will eat during the diet will have no sugar, salt or fat. This means no fruit (too much sugar), no oil (too much fat), and of course, no salt. Also, you must refrain from any food which has its own medicinal properties, like healing herbs. And finally, only food that is indigenous to the area where the diet takes place should be eaten. Diets vary, but in general you will take the plant you are dieting daily and participate in an Ayahuasca ceremony every few days. Ayahuasca allows Spirit to open up to the healing properties of the plant being dieted. Diets range in length from 8 days to 3 or more months. Below is a schedule of upcoming dieta, which we co-facilitate with our teachers each year. Diets are extremely revered in the Shamanic world. Thus, if you are interested in a Diet, but the dates below do not fit in your schedule, let us know and we can customize a program that is right for you.
