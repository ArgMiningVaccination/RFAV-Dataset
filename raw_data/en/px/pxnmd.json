Said a hardboiled illmate to s teacher in a prison school, \"You watch out. I'm afraid you'll change my ideas. I mean it. If you keep on answering my arguments day after day, I'll just have to change.\" Aims and Objectives of Education in Correctional Institutions The basic and ultimate aim of the correctional institution my be stated to be \"the social and economic rehabilitation of inmates.\" This - ' is certainly the major objective of education in correctional institutions. Delinquents and criminals are sociallyand vocationally maladjusted. They represent a dejinite and special problem for adjustment. The maladjustmenis.result from many causes, some of which operated bejore incarceration and some of which are involved in confinement away jrom a ma1 social enwironment. Educntion in correctional instilvtions aims first, to see that & large a percentage of inmates as possible do not repeat mmminal acts, and second, to enable the individual to live emiently, and with suficient interest so that he will adjust and contribute to the welfare of society. This defines the task of correctional education: To provide a series of interesting worth while experiences which will lead to desirable changes . in the attiiudes and behavior patterns of the inmate so that he will be willing and able to live eficiently in society. ..The process involved in achieving this objective is most accurately called \"socialization.\" In wder to accomplish the desired socialization of the inmate the educational program.must have the following objectives: To develop a well-rounded, integrated program of activities which will enlist the sincere interest and eflort of inmates, modify their attitudes and behavior patterns, and prowide them with the techniques, knowledges, and understandings necessary fur the maintenance of a desirable standard of self-sustaining economic and social living upon release. The attainment of 'these objectives involves the following types of activities: :f. Vocational education activities which will enable the indi- vidual to become a self-maintaining member of society. , 2. Activitics leading to clea~er understandings of modern social and economic probleir~s in order to bring about revision of undesir- able attitudes ioward social inslifutions. 3. Activities to develop acceptable proficiency in essential aca- dcmic skills. 4. Activities leading to thc stimulation and development of interest and sliill in worth while leisure-lime activities. 6. Activities leading to tkc ability to get along with people and live cooperatively as members of approved social gro~ps. These objectives cannot be reached separ~tcly becausc they are i'mcpc~robl~ involvcd wilh one anotlicr and must be reached through mfhs that cross and rccross.

GRADY FOREWORD The World of Tomorrow will be essentially a product of the world of yesterday. The observations, the research, and the experience combine to impress mankind with the possibilities of the future. In the field of the exact sciences this is a foregone conclusion, but in the field of a more abstract subject, such as education, an observer notes seemingly new and original theories. Analysis and study frequently disclose these theses to be founded on old and accepted psychological principles. If this be true with the educational field in general most certainly it is true with' what we know as prison education. Penology has a difficult road to travel before it can lay claim to being a science, and prison education being but a single yet im- portant phase, has several additional hurdles along the way. It is the anticipation of those concerned with this yearbook that it will do much to clear away some of the more dominant obstructions. Consider for a moment the words of an outstanding American penologist who stated at the First International Penitentiary Con- gress held in London in 1872:l \"The educational effort in prisons, if made efficient for reforma- tion, must be well and thoroughly organized. No slate-and-pencil arrangement, with the teacher at the cell-door occasionally, but a veritable school congregated, graded, and divided into classes. ... The. higher branches of study should be introduced, and induce- ments offered to young, capable men to prepare themselves for particular spheres of activity, even the learned professions. J 9 ... Or consider the remarks of a prison educator at the first congress of the National Prison Association held in Cincinnati in 1870, now the American Prison ~ssoci'ation, who stated:? \"Shall we shut a man out from all that is elevated and then com- plain that he seeks the low for companionship? ... Shall we give him no capacity for a l~igher social life, and then wonder that he is satisfied with the societ.y of the groveling? To give to the inmates of our prisons higher thoughts, increased acquisitions, and desires ... for a better life, is the object of the prison school. The most important clement in the whole arrangement is a suitable teacher. ... He must be a painstaking, consistent, steadfast man, of so 1 Brockway, Z. R. Proceedings oj First International Penitentiary Congress, pg. 648 ff. Private print. 2 Tarbell, H. S. \"The Prison School\", Transactions of the National Prison Congress, 1870, pg. 194. . (7) 8 Correctional Education Today much character and scholarship as to secure the respect and con- fidence of the prisoners. There must be no sham, no mere assump- tion about him; for all shrewd observers of men and motives, of all lynx-eyed detectors of hum-bug and affectation, the inmates of our prisons are the sharpest. . . . '1 Surely the intervening seventy years have produced few improve- ments over the basic policies set forth by the eminent writers of that time. Furthermore, what was stated at the first Congress to the effect that \"Education is a slow process, and is a growth as much as an acquisi- tion and that time and.reflection are important agencies in securing it,'13 can.be equally applied to the progress bf prison education. Unfor- tunately modern facilities related to prison education have been denounced and condemned as expensive luxuries and a means of coddling prisoners. This is due to a complete lack of understanding of the basic functions of a correctional institution so clearly out- lined in the report of Governor Lehman's Commission on Education. \"The ultimate and basic function of the reformatory or prison after the demands of safety and security have been met, is the rehabilita- tion and socialization of those committed to its care.\"4 It is gratifying that the editors of the yearbook have seen fit to include as a chapter a statement relative to the stimulation of public interest in correctional education. There can be no progress in any endeavor without a measure of public support and understanding. Society needs to understand the great necessity for prison educa- tion because without it the whole plan of socialization and re- habilitation is lost. Prisons, beyond the point of safely segregating . law-violators from society, are essentially character-building agen- cies. If we are to agree that an institution's basic function is the rehabilitation of offenders then we can reach no other conclusion. Society has not given much attention to the type of character many of its institutions are building until newspaper. headlines disclose that certain crimes have been solved through the arrest of ex-con- victs and parolees. Character, the psychologists state, is a system of habits-habits of industry-habit.s of recreation-habits of soci- ability or habits of living congenially with others in the group or . community. Therefore it is probably safe to admit that character Ibid p. 201 4 Report to Gov. Herbert H. Lehman by The Commission for the Study of Educational Problems of Penal Institutions for Youth, p. 63. Legislative Document No. 71. Foreword 9 is determined by the kinds of habits formed. Z. R. Brockway, who in 1898 was president of the American Prison Association, comment- ing upon this same thesis stated in 1872 that \"The prison school should be carried on for the high and holy purpose of forming aright character. Everything must bend to this. \"5 It is an accepted principle that a term of imprisonment in the average prison of today does little to elevate one's ambition and initiative, in fact, many a prisoner expresses a desire to \"do his time\" with as little effort on his part as is possible. The consequent routinized and stultifying existence is not training for better things nor is it acceptable character-building-on the contrary, it is charac- ter-deterioration. One of the functions of prison education is to prevent what is commonly referred to as \"prison stupor\" and to displace the habit or tendency to dwell in the past. Unless and until this is done the prison will remain but a place of confinement and a detriment to the community. Age-old philosphers have written that one learns what one does, and one cannot learn the fundamentals of citizenship, sportsmanship and consideration of the rights of others by being permitted to idle one's time. Few of us are sufficiently individualistic not to react occasionally to group pressure and the project at hand is one of formulating a prison com- munity where this pressure will be strong enough, over a period of time, so as to result in more acceptable behavior. As has been emphasized the problem is essentially one of habit formation. In tracing the development of prison education in America it is at once observed that the prison chaplain looms as the one important figure. For a long period religious and secular education were con- sidered as one, and the clergy in order to teach prisoners to read the Bible had first to teach the fundamentals of rending and spelling. Elementary education was necessary to an important extent before religious training could be instituted. Probably the first record of r prison education is that relating to the procedure in the old Walnut S r Street Prison, founded by the Philadclphin Quakers in 1773, three years before the birth of American indepcndence in 1776, at the time that a clergyman, William Rogers, announced religious ser- vices and instruction for the prisoners. The jail officials fearful of the venture, introduced a cannon into the jail, placed it beside the 6 Broekway, 2. R. Proceedings of First International Penitentiary Commisswn p. 649. Private print. 10 Correctional Education Today pulpit and aimed it directly at the prisoners. Stationed beside it was a guard with lighted torch ready to ignite it at the first indication of rebellion. With spasmodic efforts on the part of chaplains the next one hundred years witnessed little if any progress in the field of prison education. During that time and until 1876 with the opening of Elmira's Reformatory prisons were places of strict discipline and harsh punishment that knew no rehabilitative efforts. One noteworthy incident as relates to New York State concerns an attempt in 1826 to determine the number of illiterate convicts and as a consequence the Rev. Jared Curtis became the founder of ' the prison sabbath school as well as the first resident chaplain in America at Auburn Prison in 1827. Many of the illiterate convicts referred to, none of whom were over 25 years of age, were divided into small groups and instructed by volunteer theological students. In 1841 Governor Seward of New York stated that he \"would have the school room in the prison fitted as carefully as the solitary cell and the workshop, and although attendance there can- not be so frequent he would have it quite as regular.lr6 In 1847 secular instruction as incorporated into the new prison law of that year supported by the Prison Association of New York and Section 61 provided for the appointment of two instructors at each of the three state prisons.' They remained, however, under the direction of the chaplains. New York State thus became the first to provide paid, full-time prison teachers. Largely through the efforts of Dr. E. C. Wines, who in 1862 became secretary of the Prison Associationof New York considerable '* stimulus was given the cause of rehabilitation. Wines enthusias- tically supported the early efforts of Warden Fideon Haynes at the Massachusetts State Prison, and aided the founding of another of the earliest formal educational programs. In 1867 Haynes insti- tuted educational lectures several times monthly and in 1868 the Massachusetts legislature appropriated $1000 for the purchase of schoolbooks, to be used in teaching illiterates through semi-weekly classes. ::on a wave of unusual public interest and support occasioned through the untiring efforts of E. C. Wines and his son Frederick, Klein, Philip, Prison Methods In New York Slate, Columbia University Press, 1920, p. 312. Ibid, p. 312. Foreword , 11 Theodore Dwight, and others, the founding of Elmira Reformatory took place with the opening of the institution in 1876. For a num- I ber of years prior to that time these persons planned and worked for an institution embodying the best rehabilitative thought avail- able. Until 1881 little change was noted between the reformatory plan of education and that in vogue in the state prisons. Following that year an unusual educational program was instituted largely based on the typical public school grading plan but with some im- provement~.~ Taking advantage of the spread of public interest Dr. E. C. Wines in 1868 conceived the idea of calling a national gathering of penolo- gists and others interested in the problems of the field. The result was a congress of 130 delegates meeting in Cincinnati in 1870 'and the birth of the National Prison Association, now the American Prison Association, took place. With unusual forethought and a courageous conviction for the need of improved conditions, the congress adopted a Declaration of Principles that for many years served its purpose without need of revision. The original principle concerning education as stated in the Declaration of Principles is as follows : \"Education is a vital force in the reformation of fallen men and women. Its tendency is to quicken the intellect, inspire self-respect, excite to higher aims, and afford a healthful substitute for low and vicious amusements. Education is, therefore, a matter of primary importance in prisons, and should be carried to the utmost extent consistent with the other purposes of such institutions.\"9 Consider for comparison, the amended form of this declaration, approved at the 60th Annual. Congress in 1930, and still in the record : , \"Education is a vital force in the reformation of fallen men and women. Its tendency is to quicken the intellect, inspire self-respect, excite to higher aims, and afford a healthful substitute for low and vicious amusements. Recreation is considered to be an essential part of education. It has come to be recognized that recreation is an indispensable factor of normal human life. This principle is now heartily endorsed by prison administrators. Education in its broadest sense is, therefore, a matter of primary importance in prisons.\" At the same time this principle was amended the Association authorized the appointment of a Committee on Education and at 8 Ibid, p. 316. Transactwm of the Natidnal Prison Congress, 1570, p. 542. 12 Correctional Education Today Foreword 13 the 61st Congress in 1931 the committee made its first report. The committee conceived its function to be the promotion of better educational and library worlc in penal and correctional institu- tions.1\u00b0 The report indicated, on the basis of a rather extensive survey, that educational work in American prisons remained at a low level, but that reformatories were attempting to emphasize their programs through improvements in personnel, lessening of mass education emphasis and a more careful selection of men assigned to vocational training. During the past decade the Association'sCommittee on Education has been responsible to a large degree for the stimulus necessary to the advancement of prison education. In 1932 the Committee pre- pared and distributed The Prison Library Handbook, a bound volume describing standard library practice applicable to correc- tional institutions. Made possible by grants from the Bureau of Social Hygiene and the American Association for Adult Education the Handbook had an unusually wide circulation. Reporting an increased emphasis on prison education the committee continued to stress the great need for improved programs. Through the intervening years the committee on education has published numerous studies, book lists, suggestions for procedure, journals and other information of significance and importance to administrators. This yearbook on correctional education repre- sents the Committee's most ambitious effort to date and the committee personnel is deserving of much credit. Educational efforts in New York were given considerable em- phasis by the Commission to Investigate Prison Administration , and Construction.\" In fact, this Commission is largely responsible for the groundwork later extended by the Commission on Education in Correctional Institutions in the State of New York, appointed by Governor Lehman in December, 1933. The Prison Association of New York, through active representation on both commissions has had an important part in the advance of correctional education in New York. Outstanding among the original Commission's activi- 1 O Proceedings of 61st Congress, American Prison Association, 1931, p. 209. 11 Authorized by chapter 835 Laws of 1930. The Commission consisted of: Sam A. Lcwisohn, Chairman Senator Fred J. Slater Julia K. Jaffmy, Secretary Dr. Walter N. Thayer, Jr. Senator Thomas C. Brown Ex-ofiio Members E. R.

Robinson Assemblyman Irwin Steinyt ties, under the active and energetic leadership of Mr. Sam A. Lewisohn, was the setting into operation of an educational experi- ment at Elmira Reformatory in 1932. Stating that the aim of the Elmira experiment was \"adjustment to life\" the Commission felt that nothing was to be gained through academic instruction which has no connection with problems a released man would meet on his return to society. The present chairman of the Association's Committee on Education, Dr. Walter M. Wallack, was appointed director of the experiment and is deserving of a good part of the credit for its progress. Through the continuing years the Prison Association of New York has accomplished much in the way of exploring the whole' field of opportunity for correctional education. This yearbook on correctional education is a milestone in the influence of the American Prison Association toward the advance- ment of scientific penology and the Committee on Education is to be commended for initiating and carrying through the project. It is also appropriate to acknowledge the outstanding work of the Commission on Education in Correctional Institutions'in the State of New York whose achievements are responsible for one of the most advanced correctional educational systems in this country and whose influence has been felt in many other states. The Engelhardt Commission, as the above Commission is usually called, made this yearbook possible by providing funds for its publication. The money was part of a grant made to the Commis- sion by the American Association for Adult Education of the Carnegie Foundation for the purpose of encouraging the develop- ment of correctional education. It is important to state that the points of view expressed by the contributors to this yearbook are their own and that undoubtedly there is some disagreement, but the writers are considered authori- ties in their respective fields and the general viewpoints expressed are held by the majority of correctional workers. Correctional education is on the march and it is the anticipation of this Association that this yearbook will be the vehicle supplying the encouragement, procedure and stimulus to the end that the correctional institution will become a truly rehabilitative agency.

When the Chairman of the Committee on Education of the J I American Prison Association proposed the publication of this Yearbook, the idea came close to winning unanimous approval. I t He believcd that this volume should be a First Yearbook the contents of which would be a summation of the present status , of thought and practice concerning the educational process at )I work in American penal institutions, and that subsequent Year- 1 books, if published, should deal with some of the specific prob- i lems in correctional education, for example: social education, ', vocational education, education in institutions for mentally defec- i tive offenders, and education in institutions for female offenders. f However, somewhat in the nature of objections, the following questions were raised: Who will furnish the money for publica- i tion of the First Yearbook? For subsequent Yearbooks? Who will do the spade work in writing, editing, and distributing? Why undertake such a project which seems too ambitious? What pur- pose will the Yearbook serve? What is new to be written? What I I prison administrators who are looking for something practical will i be interested in academic material? These are all proper questions. 1 i The money for publishing the First Yearbook came from the i I Commission on Education in Correctional Institutions in the State of New York. The Committee on Education of the American Prison Association hereby gratefully acknowledges this gift. The names of the members of this Commission are listed elsewhere. . I At present it is not known who will pay for the publication of subsequent Yearbooks. It has been demonstrated that there are persons and organizations with means who are interested in advanc- ing and improving penological practices. Therefore, if this Year- book serves its intended purpose to a worthy degree, it is reasonable to believe that funds may be obtained from some source for the publication of Yearbooks in the future. The names of those who did the hard work in producing this volume appear throughout the text. They are only a few of the many able and experienced men and women in this country who could,contribute to a volume of this kind. It is undoubtedly true 1 that some of the most able did not have an opportunity to write \\ for the First Yearbook. But those who did write have given of their best. Their work speaks for itself. m7ithout exception each writer, an already very busy worker in his field, had to make some r* i Preface 15 considerable personal sacrifice in order to contribute to this volume. But it is such as these who keep the wheels of progress oiled. The , editors of the Yearbook wish to record their thanks to aU of them for their wholehearted cooperation. Members of the office staff of the Division of Education of the New York State ~e~artment of Correction and also Mr. E. R. Cass, General Secretary of the American Prison Association, deserve special mention. In particu- lar, Dr. Glenn M. Kendall has been most helpful in assisting with the editing of the chapters. He used a large quantity of midnight oil in patiently reading all of the manuscripts for the purpose of reducing to some extent the repetition which necessarily occurs when a number of writers collaborate upon a project of this kind. It should be said that the editors tried to avoid changing in any way the point of view expressed by any writer, although all of them * invited the editors to make necessary changes. Thanks are due the American Prison Association for distributing the Yearbook. Those who thought this was to be an ambitious task were right, at least to the extent that a lot of hard work was required. But that is all right if the Yearbook proves of value to those who are doing the work of correctional education. What is said in the book is addressed chiefly to them. There is a constant flow of letters into the Albany office of the New York State Department of Correction from workers in all parts of this country, and occasionally from foreign countries, asking for information upon all of the topics treated in the following chapters, and some others. Such inquiries are concerned with the \"why\" and the \"how\" of the educational work in New York State institutions. It seems much better to meet this demand by presenting the knowledge and experience of workers in all parts of the country in a series of yearbooks. There- in lies the primary purpose of this book. Secondarily, the Yearbook should be of value to institutional administrators who seek practical ways in which to improve the correctional functions of their institutions. It may be, as some believe, that our entire institutional system and penological prac- tices are wholly misconcieved and should be discarded. Be that as it may, the fact remains that the present system and practices are unlikely to undergo any radical changes very rapidly. Public indifference and lack of understanding of the problem as well as traditional fear and lethargy will, as ever, prove effectively resistive to rapid change. The history of the reforms in penology reveal 16 Correctional Education Today progress to have occurred as a result of constant pressure aimed toward introducing constructive procedures which in themselves are properly purposeful and as well serve to crowd out and replace other destructive procedures. No onecan successfully deny the con- structiveness of properly designed educational procedures nor that inmates of penal institutions are generally without the advantage of educational procediires that could have been individually bene- ficial to them. During recent years, and particularly since the publication some eight years ago of MacCormick's, \"The Education of Adult Prisoners,\" institutional administrators are increasingly turning toward the inclusion of the educational process in their efforts to find practical devices for accomplishing correction. And what is most significant, they are realizing more and more that education in the institution is most practical when it is made pur- poseful upon a basis of individual inmate needs. Therefore, that which is new to be written about correc'tional education today concerns recent experience in developing practical educational procedures in terms of the newer concepts of purpose. Of such is the subject matter in this Yearbook. It is to be regretted that there is a belief in some quarters that any discussion of educational practices must of necessity be described as academic, and t'hat anything academic is likely to have the same effect upon a prison administration as does a red flag upon a bull. Some of us know that this belief is largely a fallacy. Experience has proved that most administrators are receptive to ideas and sug- gestions which are practical and which will aid them in improving their programs. Throughout this Yearbook educational theory is expressed through suggestions and plans which. have been success- fully carried out in correctional institutions. Every chapter was written by persons who have had considerable experience in and close contact with institutional problems. It has been demonstrated time and again that when the educational staff presents carefully prepared plans for improving the educational program, adrninis- trators provide the support necessary for the educational personnel to work out the technical details. It is believed that the discussions in this Yearbook will prove helpful to prison administrators who desire to strengthen their rehabilitative programs for inmates. October 1,1939 WALTER M. WALLACK Chairman, Committee on Education American Prison Association CHAPTER I 3 i RESUME OF PROGRESS IN CORRECTIONAL ?, EDUCATION i BY I' A Hon. Austin H. MacCormick j I Commissioner of Correction, New York City i d i' More progress has been made by the prisons and reformatories i for adults in the United States during the present decade in the I development of educational programs comparable in aim, method T 1 and accomplishment to those in the world outside the malls than 1 I was made in the preceding century or more. Education of a sort f was advocated by the founders of some of our earliest prisons, but 3 d only the most rudimentary types of education had found their way . . into our penal institutidns up to the last quarter of the nineteenth i f century. When the first reformatory for men was opened at Elrnira in 1876, education was proclaimed to be the keystone of the arch of reform. For a variety of reasons, however, the educa- 4 9 tional programs of our reformatories for men failed to fulfill the high hopes of their founders and, in most reformatories, sank for a I time to the level of mediocrity. The beginning of what may be considered the modern era in penal and correctional education was 4 approximately ten years ago, in 1929-30, and it is from this date that one sees the most striking and significant advances that I I I education has ever made in the history of our prisons and reforma- a tories. Instruction in our prisons up to the middle of the nineteenth 1 1 century was largely religious in nature or, if secular, it was designed 1 1 to facilitate religious instruction. The first book introduced into our prisons mas The Book. The chaplains were charged with the duty of instruction and confined their efforts largely to teaching prisoners to read the Bible and religious tracts, and instructing them in religion and morals. In New York Stnte the laws of 1822 provided that '(it shall be lawful to furnish a Biblc for each prisorler confined in a solitary cell\" and in 1829 this privilege was extended to all inmates. In 1824 the Warden of Auburn Prison successfully opposed an attempt to teach the younger convicts to read and write 1 @r fear of \"the increased.danger to Society of the educated convict.'' 18 Correctional Education Today As late as 1845 very few institutions taught even the three R's and a characteristic form of instruction consisted of the chaplain teach- ing the rudiments of reading or arithmetic to a prisoner through the - grated door of his celI in a semi-dark corridor lighted by a dingy lamp. Recognition appears to have been first given to education in the lam of any state in 1847, when a law was passed in New York State providing for the a,ppointment of two instructors at each of the state prisons and providing that \"it shall be the duty of such instructors with, and under the super- vision of, the Chaplain to give instruction in the useful branches of an English education to such convicts as, in the judgment of the Warden or the Chaplain, may require the same and be benefitted by it; such instruction shall be given for not less than one hour and a half daily, Sunday excepted, between the hours of six and nine in the evening.\" Reports of the Prison Association of New York in the early seven- ties, hoivcver, indicate that the educational work provided by this law amounted to little. At that time there was apparently little educational work that was worthy of note in any of the prisons of the country, although the importance of academic education was generalIy recognized and prison libraries had also succeeded in establishing their validity on other than theological grounds. It was in 1869 that one of the most significant steps forward in the history of American penology, from the standpoint of rehabili- tation in general and education in particular, was taken when the New York legislature provided for the establishment of a reforma-, tory for young men at Elmira. This institution, which was opened in 1876, is the pioneer reformatory for men in this country. Today there are twenty-four such reformatories in'twenty states and the District of Columbia. Of these, New Jersey has two, one walled and one unwalled, and the United States Bureau of Prisons operates two, both unwalled. While institutions in different parts of the country and established on widely scattered dates over a period of sixty years are bound to differ somewhat in plan and program,most of the reformatories for men were patterned after Elmira and the educational history of the whole group, with the exception of those established in recent years, is substantially the same as that of Elmira. In the early reformatories for men, established under the influence of what was known as the Irish system, emphasis was placed on Resume of Progress in Correctional Education 1 19 education, productive labor, the mark system, the indeterminate sentence, and parole. The type of education which their founders had in mind may be determined from a description of the Elmira program written by F. H. Wines: \"The other great thought, here insisted upon, as nowhere else in the world, is that the whole process of reformation is education; not meaning by that term the injection of information without assimilation, but the drawing out to its fulI natural and normal limit of every faculty of the body, mind, and soul of every man who passes through the institution. This is accomplished by all sorts of athletic training, shop work, military drill, gymnastics . . . baths, massage, and diet; but all sorts of intellectual discipline as well, including not merely instruction and the hearing of lectures on subjects in which prisoners most need instruction, but also systematic reading under direction, and examination upon the books read; writing for the . . . prison weekly which circulates instead of the ordinary daily newspaper within the walls; and debate, in the presence of a teacher who guides and moderates the discussion. Trade instruction is made prominent. The aim of the institution is to send no man out who is not prepared to do something well enough to be independent of the temptation to fraud or theft.\"' Thus did 2. R. Brockway, the first Superintendent of Elmira, give education for the first time an important pIace in the correc- tional process. That the older reformatories never lived up to the expectations of their founders is due to a variety of causes. Even if the pioneers realized with what difficult human material they were dealing and how involved the process of reformation would prove to be, it is certain that many of their successors did not and that they and the general public relied too complacently on the power of educationd.machinery to grind out a worth while product on a mass-production basis. Sixty years of experience have taught us that reformatory prisoners in their late 'teens and earIy twenties are inclined to be unstable, unresponsive and apathetic toward good influences in general and education in particular, because they have so often found public school work distasteful. Today we seek to individualize the educational work in our institutions, especially for the younger group, and to adapt it to their particular needs, capacities and desires rather than to some arbitrary educa- tional standard.

Resume of Progress in Correctional Education 2 1 In the earlier years of their existence, the educational work of the reformatorics for men was patterned closely after the standard public school courses in which most of the prisoners had already failed. Vocational education was prescribed on an unselective basis, and the trades were taught with heavy emphasis on monotonous train- ing exercises and with insufficient opportunity for practical applica- tion. Productive industries were almost universally barred on the assumption that they had no place in a reformatory program. The result was that there was not enough work for all the prisoners, and both the classrooms and the vocational shops were cluttered up with \"students\" who had neither capacity for nor interest in the type of education which they were offered. Education, both academic and vocational, became frequently a mass treatment process, in which a stereotyped routine was fol- lowed. Legislatures and budgetary authorities, accepting even the slow whir of educational machinery as evidence that something was , being accomplished, granted inadequate funds for personnel, equip- ment and supplies. Insufficient opportunity was given for the . educational personnel to keep in touch with the subjects or the trades which they mere teaching and the reformatory programs became inferior even to those of the public school system, which had little enough to offer a problem boy in his late 'teens during the latter part of the nineteenth century and the first years of the twentieth. As the superintendents of these institutions began to recognize the futility of attempting to give academic and trade training to all their young charges and sought to establish productive indus- tries, they found it virtually impossible to establish a diversified system of industries having vocational training value and some- times found themselves saddled with contract'shops manufacturing chcap clothing or other shoddy products. The history of our reformatories for men from 1876 to 1930 is not one of complete failure, however. It is rather the history of a losing fight to live up to the expectations of the public that mass education in and of itself could accomplish the miracle of reform \\\\ith a group of young prisoners who had already failed in the public schools, some of whom could not profit appreciably by any type of education, and many of whom could be reached successfully only by a highly individualized educational program, staffed with superi- or pcrsonnci, and supportcd by adequate appropriations for all purposes. It was not that the superintendents of these institutions were insincere in continuing to go through the motions of trying to educate all the prisoners long after they had realized the futility of such an attempt, but that they were public officials who were obey- ing the public dictate that they carry on what was conceived to be a reformatory program, but without the facilities, funds or per- sonnel required to educate young men, let alone to reform them. By 1930 there were points of excellence worth noting in prac- tically all of the reformatories for men, but none had a really effective program of education and none was adequately staffed and financed, especially for vocational training. Throughout the country, however, the reformatories mere clearly throwing off the shackles of tradition and were gradually developing educational programs that were selective and individualized and followed, in content and method, the best current educational practice. Today the low rumbling of outworn educational machinery is no longer the typical sound of the reformatory. There, as elsewhere in the penal and correctional field, we have achieved a re-statement of aims, or rather a re-definition of the methods by which' the ancient and worthy aim of reform can be achieved. The best educational programs to be found in all the institutions of the country today are probably those of the Nc~v York State Reformatory at Elmirs and the United States Industrial Reformatory at Chillicothe, Ohio.2 Twenty-one states in the Federal Government operate twenty- five reformatories, prisons or farms for women. The first of these was established in Indiana in 1573 and the second in Massachusetts in 1577. All of the others have been established since 1900. Fronl the first, the reformatories for women and similar institutions estab- lished to take the place of the former women's sections of men's prisons had an educational aim; this aim, whether definitely ex- pressed or not, was social education: training for life in the world outside as a well adjusted, socialized human being. From that standpoint, they were a decade ago the most hopeful of all our American correctional institutions. That they no longer have a position of pre-eminent leadership in thc field is due rather to the advances made in institutions for men than to retrogression in $he ... women's reformatories. Institutions for women have an advanhge over those for men in that the daily routine work provides excellent 'For further analysis of the devcloprncnt of the legal concept of correctional education, in one State from IS23 to 1935, see Education Within Prison 1Valls, Wallack, Iicndiil1,G.

Tlieir physical plants are generally so designed as to contribute to 1 their educational effectiveness and to enhance their socializing value. In the newer institutions the buildings and grounds resemble those of fine schools more nearly than of penal institutions. Although j women's reformatories have never had adequate funds, they tend to ' employ staff members who have a socialized viewpoint and their 1 staffs ordinarily contain a larger percentage of persons with pro- ;! fessional or technical training and outlook than do the staffs of .I men's institutions. They have not been afraid to carry on some 'i 1 activities in the recreational and cultural field which men's insti- i tutions long avoided for fear of public criticism. The chief weakness of educational programs in women's institu- ,! tions has been that they have tended to put too little emphasis on ; the mechanics of training, just as men's reformatories tended to 1 over-emphasize machinery and program. Vocational training of women prisoners often shows the lack of precise and careful planning . f 8$ in accordance with accepted educational standards. It has been .: and still is too oft,en haphazard, the institution relying on the head .I of the laundry, for example, to instruct the women worlung there without setting up a definite course of training in which the routine i '1 work is supplemented by technical instruction and other related .! I work. These institutions now very generally realize that it is i possible to give organized vocational training of the most intensive J sort without losing any of the touch with reality or the appeal to I the interests of the women which have made their educational work a living thing. .I The program of academic education in most reformatories for 4 i women has been radically weak in the past and today has definitely 4 fallen behind similar programs in the leading institutions for men. f It is true that many reformatory women are of low intelligence and find academic instruction difficult and dull and that they are more i interested in vocational training. It is also true, that, with the 1 exception of those who are going into commercial work and similar I occupations, women prisoners are inclined to feel that academic education will not be of great value to them. The more progressive reformatories for women, however, are individualizing their .aca- dcmic training, correlating it with the vocational training and with f 1 those activities which aim particularly at social education. and so are giving it significance. It is interesting to note that one of the oldest reformatories for women in the country now refers to all its Resume of Progress in Correctional Education 23 inmates as \"students.\" The chief bar today to educational advance in the reformatories for women is not the lack of a high purposc but, as in the institutions for men, the lack of adequate funds for educa- tional equipment and supplies and especially for personnel. In summary, it may be said of these institutions that they fortunately escaped the period of stereotyped and futile routine through which so many reformatories for men passed and that they may again take the lead among correctional institutions, especially in vocational training and social education. As stated above, the year 1929-30 marked the beginning of what might be called a renaissance in prison education, except that there was very little to be re-born. These years marked rather the begin- ning of a period during which the idea was firmly established in the minds of institution officials, and that portion of the public which is interested in such problems, that education is an essential element in a modern program of correctional treatment, and that it must be education of the same type and quality that has been found effec- tive with adults in the world outside of institutions, with such modifications as are dictated by the fact that the locale is a prison and the students are prisoners. During the past decade prison education at last achieved maturity, has put on long trousers, has risen above the level of the three R's, has become a process of edu- cating adults by adult methods. Professional personnel and pro- fessional standards have found their way at last inside our prison gates and it is accepted as axiomatic among progressive officials that anything falling below the level of accepted educational standards has no more place in the prison than it has in public school systems and training courses for free adults. What was the general situation in our penal and correctional institutioris for adults just prior to these significant years 1920-30 and what brought about the changes that have taken place since then? The writer is in a position to answer the first part of this question with confidence, for during the year 1927-25 he visited all the prisons and reformatories for men and nronlen in the country, with three exceptions, and made an intensive study of their cduca- tional programs under a grant of funds from the Carnegie Corpora- tion to the National Society of Pennl Information, now the Osborne Association. It is unncccssary to give a detailed picture of what he discovered during that year, and the record is not one which most of us who are engaged in educational work for prisoners like to recall. 24 . Correctional Education Today :1 It was necessary to record with regard to the prisons, as distinct : .a from the reformatories for men and women, that .! \"taking the country as a whole, me are tolerating a tragic failure. * * * Not a single complete and well-rounded educational program, adequately financed and staffed, mas encountered in all the prisons in tllc country. * * * There is no educational program in thirteen prisons. In about an equal number the educational work makes little more than a halting and grudging bow to state laws requiring that every prisoner (with liberal exceptions made by the \\firden and the industrial authorities) shall be given a third or fifth grade education. In less than a dozen prisons the worlc is extensive cnough or effective enough or sufficiently well supervised to rise above the level of mediocrity. In the remainder, constituting about half of all the prisons in the country, the educational work has little significance. * * * It is an amazing fact that not one prison has an organized program of vocational education. * * * There is also little educational opportunity for the prisoner who wishes to advance beyond the lower grades or who already has education enough to fit him for advanced studies. * * * The educational work of most prisons, in brief, consists of an academic school closely patterned after public schools for juveniles, having a low aim, enrolling students unselectively, inadequately financed, inexpertly supervised and taught, occupying mean quarters and using poor equipment and textual material.'' Among the things which the writer saw in pcnal institutions in various parts of the country during that year are the following: ;. \"13istory being taught from texts that were published before the World War, and reading from primers published as far back as 1 1868; seventy-five men of all ages crammed into the only classroom in the prison, seated on backless benches without desks, taught ; 1 under the district school method by an earnest but untrained chap- lain, and searched by guards on entering and leaving the classroom; j sixty reformatory inmates in a single room, taught by an untrained 'I inmate under twenty years of age, with a Sleepy, stupid-looliing , j guard perched on a high stool in the front of the classroom to keep order; guards conducting classes with l~iclrory clubs lying on their 'i, desks; guard-teachers, after a hard day's work in the school, 'swing- ing a c11ib' over their erstwhile pupils in the cell llouscs and mess 1 hall; a $130-a-month guard in charge of the educational work in a 3,000-man penitentiary; men studying in the prison of one of the ! tvealthiest states in the country by the light of fifteen-watt bulbs; > 1 rules forbidding prisoners attending school to have writing material , of any kind in their cells; educational 'systems' that consist of allow- , l ing prisoners, without guidance, to purchase correspondence courses far beyond their ability and to follow them rvithout assistancc; ; schools that are nothing but dumping grounds for the industries, places of temporary sojourn for men who have not yet been assigned I Resume oj Progress in Co~reclional Education 25 to work, or convenient roosting places for yard gangs that are called on occasionally to unload cars of coal and other supplies; libraries in which there are not more than a dozen up-to-date books possess- ing educational value.\" This rather distressing description is quoted now chiefly because it offers several excellent esamples of what has happened in the ten years since it was written. To choose only a few of the items, most institutions now teach history that is as up-to-the-minute ns the radio and the daily newspaper can make it; the institution where the district school was being conducted now has an elaborate educa- tional program, worked out with the help of the state university, and has recently completed psychometric tests of all its prisoners; the institution where the young inmate was teaching under the drowsy eye of a guard now has one of the two best educational pro- grams to be found in the country. The 3,000-man penitentiary referred to now has an outstanding educational program under a man with a Ph.D. degree, assisted by a trained staff and having excellent classroom and library facilities at his command. The institution with the fifteen-watt bulbs may still have them in its oldest cells, but it also has one of the finest educational buildings to be found in the country, as well as the most expensive system of intramural correspondence courses. As a matter of fact, there were some bright spots in thc educa- tional programs of our institutions even in 1927-28. The two outstanding programs at that time were probably those of thc California State Prison at San Quentin and the Wisconsin State Prison at Waupun, chiefly because of the extent to which thcse institutions were utilizing correspondence courses provided by their respective state universities and so were not only individualizing education but keeping it on a high level. Both institutions were also receiving great help from thrir st3te librzry authorities. The library service in the llinncsota institutions, under a trained super- visor of institutio~ial libraries, was outstanding in thc country. Prison libraries in general showed sincere intcrest 3nd conscientious effort on the part of those in chargc of thcn~, although they also showed notable lack of funds for new books and supplies ant1 were scldom in charge of trained librarians.

' Correctional Education Today a half-dozen prisons, the provision of free extension and correspond- ence courses for prisoners by Pennsylvania State College, the pioneer effort of the State Department of Education in Arkansas to provide educational opportunities on the scattered prison farms, the corre- lation of education with the psychological work in the Pennsylvania prisons and in New Jersey, and the foremen's training conferences conducted at the Ohio State Penitentiary under the auspices of the State Department of Education. These scattered instances of diverse accomplishments are meagre enough but they stand out in contrast to the generally dark picture which one was forced to paint of educational work in our prisons a decade ago. The situation in the reformatories for men and women, which was far better than that in the prisons but in no instance revealed an adequately financed and staffed educational program, has been described briefly above. The significance of the year 1929-30 as the turning point in the history of American correctional education is due to several things, of which the most important are probably the striking develop- ments which began at that time in the educational programs of the Federal prison system and of New York State. These develop- ments offer concrete illustrations of what can be accomplished, and demonstrated beyond question that well-rounded educational pro- grams can be established on a high level in penal and correctional inet,;t,.~t~;qns OEviously. the Federal and New York State prison systems had rnore resources at their command than those of most.,. states, but the ex;tmples they offered were effective, just as the educational practices of the larger cities are reflected in the smaller and poorer communities. At about this time a wide-spread interest in educational work for prisoners began to develop rapidly. The boblr3 which resulted from the nation-wide survey referred to above attracted attention to the problem and pointed out ways in which the existing situation could be improved. Prison officials began to talk of education in new terms and with a ncrv comprehension of its possibilities. The American Prison Association established a standing Committee on Education in 1930. This committee collaborated from the first with the Committee on Institution Libraries of the American Library Association and sought to promote improved library pro- grams because of their value in direct and indirect cducstion. In 1938 the American Prison Association created a standing Conlnlittce on J,iLmrics. The Committee on Education has provided intcrcst- 'MacCormick, Austin 11.

The developments in the Federal prison system began with the appointment of Mr. Sanford Bates to the office of Supcrilltcndcnt of Prisons (the title was later changed to Director of the United States Bureau of Prisons) and were a part of the general program of rehabilitation which was established in the Federal institutions under his administration. Congressional appropriations obtained in 1930 made it possible to establish a trained supervisor of educa- tion, two assistant supervisors, and EL trained librarian in each of the major Federal penitentiaries and reformat,ories. Correspond- cnce instruction had already bccn initiated at the Unites Statcks Penitentiary in Leavenworth by L. R. Alderman of the United States Bureau of Education and a very fine library had been estah- lished at the McNeil Island Penitentiary, largely through efforts of the prisoners themselves. The beginning of an education:tl pro- gram had been made at the United States Industrial Rcformalory at Chillicothe, but in none of the Federal institutions prior to 1030, was there any educational work worthy of note. Classrooms and improved library facilities were provided, even in the old penitentiary buildings, and estcnsive use was made of sas mn;!,: for up-to-date educational facilities and n fine school building wss built at Chillicothe.

The superior facilities at Lewisburg have made it possible not only to establish a program of academic education enrolling a large per- centage of the prisoners on a voluntary basis, but also to provide a wide variety of vocational training courses on a selective and indi- vidualized basis. The great advances that have been made in the institutions of New York State since 1930 were not due to a single occurrence, but rather to a series of wise and constructive administrative acts. In 1930 Governor Roosevelt created a Commission to Investigate Prison Administration and Construction and appointed Mr. Sam A. Lewisohn, chairman. This Commission made an intensive study of the whole problem, and a sub-committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Edward R. Cass, General Secretary of the American Prison Association, made a study of the educational problem and prepared a report and recommendations. In November 1932, Dr. Walter M. IVallack, now Chairman of the Committee on Education of the American Prison Association and editor of this volume, was em- ployed by the Lewisohn Commission as educational advisor. He was sent to Elmira Reformatory to re-organize the educational program there acd after the Le~visohn Commission terminated its work he was appointed Director of Vocational Education in the State Department of Correction and continued to supervise the work at Elmira. These were the first steps in the process of bring- ing not only Elmira but the whole institutional system of New York State to a position of leadership in the educational field. In 1933 Governor Lehman created a Commission for the Study of the Educational Problems of Penal InstitLitions for Youth, com- posed of educators, penologists and laymen and headed by Professor N. L. Engelhardt of Teachers College. As ode of its major projects the Commission established and sponsored, with a grant of $25,000 obtained through the American Association for Adult Education from the Carncgie Corporation, two experimental programs, one in social and vocational education at Wallkill Prison and a second in vocational education at Clinton Prison. With the help of the Comnlission legislation was passed creating a Division of Education in the State Department of Correction and Dr. Wallack became the first Director. TIrhcn the demonstrations in the two institutions were successfully completed, the two trained men who had been in Resume of Progress in Correctional Education 1 29 charge of the project at Wallkill were appointed Assistant Directors of Education in the State Department. With the steadfast support of Governor Lehman budget appropri- ations for educational work have been increased steadily until the present budget represents an increase of approximately 150% over that of 1931. This increase is largely reflected in additions to trained personnel. From one to ten teachers have been added in each institution and a number of experts have been added in supervisory positions. The present appropriations for all educa- tional purposes in all institutions under the Department of Correc- tion is approximately $350,000. This appears to be a large sum but actually represents an annual cost per inmate of about $25. This is extremely low when compared with public school cost per pupil. Not only do the New York State institutions utilize the best material available from outside sources, but they have also devel- oped high grade teaching material for both academic and vocational courses, especially prepared for adult prisoners. The most signifi- cant development is the program of social education, in which as much of the teaching as possible is done in such a way as to produce the maximum socializing value, and in which shecia1 courses are presented to develop social insight and attitudes as well as skills. The Division of Education was charged in 1936 with the duty of organizing and directing the Central Guard School which was established at Wallkill to train recruits and later to give in-service training to the guards in the various institutions. The school has now trained over 1,000 guards and a number of men of higher rank. This activity is cited because, in the opinion of some of the leaders in the institution educational field, the training of guards and other personnel is a proper function of the educational authorities as well as the training of prisoners. The influence of these two large and important prison systems on the institutions of the rest of the country has been marked. No longer has it been necessary to discuss thcory; at last it is possible to point to actual accomplishments. Directors of education, teach- ers and chaplains who are playing a lone hand in institutions here and there about the country have borrowed ideas and material from New York and from the Federal Government, and have been encouraged anew by the proof that successful educational programs can be established if funds and personnel are made available. 30 Correctional Education Today Progress during the last decade has by no means been confined to these two systems. San Quentin has expanded and improved its already notenrorthy correspondence course system and has obtained permission from the University of California to grade the papers of the inmate students. Its inmate teachers are accredited by the State Department of Public Instruction, a fine new educational building has been constructed, the State Library Commission con- tinues to coopcrate to the fullest extent, and San Quentin now has a much more well-rounded program than ten years ago. The Wisconsin Prison and the Reformatory for Men still use the excell- ent extension courses supplied by the University and the unusually liberal book-loaning services of the State Library Commission. Their program has been greatly improved, however, by the appoint- ment of trained resident directors of education, so that the univer- sity courses are now only a part of a well-rounded program. Another of the pioneers in good educational work, the Western State Penitentiary of Pennsylvania, has expanded and improved its program and the Eastern State Penitentiary at Philadelphia has a trained director and a constantly expanding program. The Michi- gan State Prison at Jackson has one of the most extensive programs in all the prisons 6f the country, and the Massachusetts institutions are advancing, particularly the State Prison Colony at Norfolk, whose library is especialIy worthy of note. In a number of the southern prison systems, notably that of North Carolina, and elsewhere throughout the country, progress has been made with the aid of educational personnel supplied by the Works Progress Administration and it is hoped that these gains can be consolidated by the appointment pf permanent personnel when W.P.A. services cease. Courses are no longer confined to the elementary grades in either prisons or reformatories; many offer bourses of high school and college level, and several state departments of education and universities give standard credits to prisoners completing extension courses. Even in jails and other institutions for short-term prisoners there are sporadic examplcs of attempts, usually with W.P.A. assistance, to establish educational and library programs in spite of the well- known difficulties encountered. At the New York City Peniten- tiary on Riker's Island 1200 prisoners voluntarily attend day or evening school or are enrolled in cell study correspondence courses. The warden of this institution is the former director of education of a Federal penitentiary, and his staff includes trained men selected r Resume of Progress in Correctional Education 3 1 by civil service to head the education, library and recreation pro- grams. They are assisted by a large number of W.P.A. teachers, librarians, recreation workers, musicians, vocational instructors, and clerks. Space forbids mention of all the instances of progress which could be cited in various parts of the country. That education is soIidly entrenched in our institutions is unmistakably clear; insti- tution officials everywhere are desirous of establishing educational programs as soon as funds are available, and the development of outstanding programs appears only to await the day when legis- lators and state administrative officials grasp the importance of educational work as an agency of rehabilitation and therefore as an instrument for the protection' of Society. An encouraging sign is that administrators of state and local educational systems are at last becoming alive to and interested in the part they can play in the work of controlling crime at every stage of the process from the prevention of juvenile delinquency to the training of the adult prisoner in preparation for parole. The American Association of School Adminstrators, at its annual con- ference in 1938 in Atlantic City, invited a dozen penologists and educators interested in prisoner-education to address one of its sessions on the topic \"Reduction of Crime Through Improved Public Educational Programs and the Educational Rehabilitation of Prison Inmates.\" Not only was a large hall crowded to capacity, but the overflow audience filled several large adjoining rooms and listened to the speeches over the public address system. In 1939 a similar session on \"The Challenge of Crime\" drew 8,000 school administrators to the Municipal Auditorium in Cleveland. In 1933 the New York State Vocational Association first organized a section on Correctional Education which has met annually since that time; the 1939 meeting had the largest attendance to date. Other educational organizations, both national and local in scope, are now showing interest in a problem which ten years ago seemed to them nearly as remote as the education of priests in the monas- teries of Tibet. In conclusion, the significance of the progress that has been made in the last decade lies not so much in such visible and tangible things as new buildings, new books and supplies, new personnel with train- ing and vision. It lies rather in the establishment of new standards, 80 that we can no longer speak properly of prison educat,ion as dis- tinct from other types of education. Today me have accepted the 32 Correctional Education Today aims of education as we find them in the free world and have voiced our declaration of faith that these aims are not too high for those who are educating prisoners. We are not trying to develop some freak- ish and bizarre technique which may work the magic of reformation, but are utilizing the educational tools, content and method which time has demonstrated to be effective with free adults and which sound judgment and experience convince us will be effective with prisoners. Above all things, we have accepted the fact that the education of prisoners must be in the hands of educators, and that they must be persons with superior training and ability if they are to organize and conduct programs the essence of which is individual- ization. The following chapters nill reveal the diversity of the problems encountered by the prison educator. It has been the purpose of this chapter to trace briefly the progress from the early days of the religious tracts and the three R's to the present day concept of education in its broadest sense. CHAPTER I1 . FUNDAMENTAL FACTORS GOVERNING THE SUCCESS OF A CORRECTIONAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM by N. L. Engelhardt Professor of Education Teachers College, Columbia University When the Commission on Education in Correctional Institutions in the State of New York was first appointed by Governor Herbert H. Lehman in December 1933, one of the first tasks confronting it was to define the scope of education in correctional institutions. The Correction Law previous to this time carried a very restricted concept of education. On May 3, 1935 an amendment to the Correction Law of New York State was passed which incorporated the following definition of prison education: Section 1. The objective of prison education in its broadest sense should be the sociaIization of the inmates through varied impres- sional and expressional activities, with emphasis on individual inmate needs. The objectives of this program shall be the return of these inmates to society with a more wholesome attitude toward living, with a desire to conduct themselves as good citizens and with the slcill and knowledge which ~vill give them a reasonable chance to maintain themselves and their dependents through honest labor. To this end each prisoner shall be given a program of education which, on the basis of available data, seems most likely to further the process of socialization and rehabilitation. The time daily dcvoted to such education shall be such as is required for meeting the above objectives. The director of education, subject to the direction of the commissioner of correction and after consultation by such commissioner with the state commissioner of education, shall develop the curricula and the education programs that are required to meet the special needs of each prison and reformatory in the department. Those responsible for securing this change in the Correction Law felt that prison education must concentrate upon the needs of the individual and must furnish a substantial foundation upon which the individual can build for readjustment into the social and economic life into which he returns. It was felt that education for vocational ends alone mould not suffice in the rehabilitation of the prisoner but that he must be given a new outlook upon the 34 Correctional Education Today social order of which he is a part. This new 1935 law expresses the objcctives of an educational program so widely that practically any desirable educational curriculum may be developed in the institutions of New York State. In this broad definition of correctional education, there is no desire to minimize the importance of vocational education. It is fully recognized that the educational program of the prison should be sufficiently broad to enable the released inmate to become a self-maintaining member of society. The vocational activities should be such for each individual as to make this accomplishment possible. It is also assumed that inmates lacking in their early education in the fundamentals of reading, writing, and arithmetic must be allowed to develop a proficiency which is in accord with their vocational needs and also of a nature to make for broadening their horizons on leaving the institution. If nothing else can be accomplished, the educational activities should at least provide for clearer understandings on the part of the inmate of modem social and economic problems so that un- desirable attitudes toward social institutions may be revamped in the light of better knowledge. In other words, the program for social education should be a very extensive one and should be adjusted definitely to the peculiar needs of the institutionalized individual. Perhaps no single phase of prison education is more important than that of the stimulation and development on the part of inmates of interests and skills in worthwhile leisure-time activities. This program of education should compensate against the retirement of individuals from normal life and should permit of encouragement of the gradual return of individuals to activities engaged in by those outside of prison walls. It is also possible that the educational program in leisure-time activities will tend toward guidance into fields in which inmates may make a reasonable living for themselves and familics. The educational program should also stress the prob- lems involved in cooperative living so that inmates may learn adaptation to customs and habits of social groups long approved by society in general. The institutionalization of man has grown rapidly in our oivilized countries. The cost of this institutionalization has also increased many timcs. It cannot be expected that our society can continue to add to these costs indefinitely. Men and women sent to insti- tutions for the breaking of laws may be expected to return to society , -. I Fundamental Factors in Correctional Education 35 after periods of imprisonment of varied lengths. If the institutional program has been successful, the readjustment of the individual on his return to society should be readily and successfully made. To be sure, this is an ideal which has not yet been achieved. The accomplishment of this ideal can only be brought about through the right kind of educational programs. Society knows well what it expects of the inmate who is returned to its ranks from the cor- rectional institution. The aim of the educational program of society in the correctional institution should therefore be to guide and train the individual inmate so that he may carry out success- fully the responsibilities which society places upon him on his release. The social education program of the prison should enable the inmate to do better the desirable things that he normally would do on his release from the institution. The new Correction Law, in which correctional education was redefined, also set up certain educational requirements for the certification of teachers in the institutions of New York State. The law reads as follows: The state commissioner of education, in cooperation with the commissioner of correction and the director of education, shall set up the educational requirements for the certification of teachers in all such prisons and reformatories. Such educational requirements shall be sufficiently broad and comprehensive to include training in penology, sociology, psychology, philosophy, in the special sub- jects to be taught, and in any other professional courses as may be deemed necessary by the responsible officers. No certificates for teaching service in the state institutions shall be issued unless a minimum of four years of training beyond the high school has been secured, or an acceptable equivalent. No educational prograb can be carried out satisfactorily in an institution without nrell-trained teachers. All members of the personnel, in addition t,o being thoroughly trained in their own specific duties, should have a clear understanding of the objectives and functions of each phase of the institutional program. There must be a high degree of integration between the programs of the. educator and the other programs which are being carried out in the institution. Social and econon~ic rehabilitation of the inmat.e can only be accomplished \\vhen the institutional administration and thc entire prison personnel become conscious of what the educa- tional program is attempting to achieve, and of the procedures necessary to secure the results. Education must be an integral part of the organization for administration in every institution. 36 Correctional Education Today Each member of the employed personnel, from the warden down to workers in all of the areas of the institution, must have frequent opportunity for interpreting the functions of education and for learning definitely what is being attempted through the educational ' program. Education in correctional institutions must have definite and tangible outcomes. The program must be organized by professional workers ivho understand curriculum development and the method- ology to be employed, and who are familiar with the materials and literature of thc fields in which the inmate is to be instructed. The educational director in the correctional institution nust be given authority commensurate with the scope and possibilities of the > educational program to be carried on. He must be a trained super- visor familiar not only with education, but also with the problems of penology. He should have intimate knowledge of the adminis- tration of penal institutions. KO program of education can be advanced successfully except as the educational work is highly integrated with that of the Parole Board. The Parole Board occupies a strategic position with refer- encc to the inmate. It knows the types of activities in which the inmate may enter upon release, it can assist significantly in sug- gesting the types of educational programs to be advanced, arid it should use the institutional record of education and vocational achievement in its follow-up work with the released inmate. Educa- tional adjustment itself will not be meaningful except as society is willing to assist parole boards and the institutional authorities in providing every opportunity to the inmate of taking a desirable place ~*ithin the social group. Education in correctional institutions cannot be carried on in its most significant way except as the state-wide system of classification of prisoners is advanced to the point where each institution receives only the type of inmate best adapted to its organization and objec- tives. Inmate programs of reeducation and rehabilitation can only be planned on an individual basis and only in the light of all per- tinent factors. The classification clinic and guidance bureau of each institution must be prepared to render service in giving the complcte history and diagnosis of individuals so that purposeful training and true guidance may be based thereon. Xo program of prison education can be successful except as the 1 curricula arc developed with reference to the special needs of the groups to be educated. Continuous experimentation and research I ~undamental Faclors in Correctional Education 37 in curriculum must be carried on so that the best methods of read- justment in all phases of prison life may be ascertained. The trans- fer of curricula from the public schools and colleges to the field of prison education cannot be expected to be successful. Curriculum must be adapted to the needs of the individuals and to the institu- tions in which those individuals find themselves. Pugmire', in his study on The Administration of Personnel in Correctional Institutions in New York State, defines correctional education as follows: Correctional education is the process or the means of achieving the reformation, correction, or rehabilitation of inmates in correc- tional institutions. It comprehends all of the experiences which such an institution can bring into the lives of those inmates. It goes beyond the programs of academic and vocational instruction commonly found at the present time and includes the activities of every department or division of the institution with which inmates have contacts. It makes prisons and reformatories basically edu- cational institutions. In reality, the correctional instit6tion is going through a period of transformation. The purposes underlying the work of the insti- tution, which have been inherited from the past, are undergoing rapid change. Society is not interested merely in the imprisonment of individuals. Society operates successfully to the degree that the largest percentage of its membership is working in normal situations and contributing successfully to the social and economic advance of the group. The whole purpose of prison education should be to return individuals to the ranks of society with such equipment that they may serve society successfully and at the same time live reasonably happy and constructive lives.

Organization and Administration oj Education 39 CHAPTER 111 ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF EDUCATION-ITS INTEGRATION WITH OTHER ELEMENTS IN THE TREATMENT PROGRAM by C. K. Morse .4ssistant Director, University Extension Division University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraslca Prisons for adults in the United States have a population of approximately one hundred and fifty thousand, which is larger than the population of Des Moines or Scranton, Salt Lake City or Chattanooga. The fact that the great majority of the adults com- mitted to our prisons eventually return to society should cause every citizen interested in the general welfare of our commonwealth to give serious thought to the program of penal institutions. Improvement in the prisons of the United States has been marked in recent years. One cannot read proceedings of the American Prison Association1 following 1920 without being .very much impressed by the sincere desire of the leaders of this organi-. zation to accept the philosophy that the rehabilitation of prisoners is the second of their two major objectives, the first, of course, being the carrying out of the order of the court relative to security. Today it is quite commonly accepted that it is idle to expect mere incar- ceration to improve or reform character. The effective education of prisoners is a recent addition to the treatment program which as yet is not utilized by all of our state penal institutions. This fact was brought to public attention about ten years ago by Austin H. MacCormick,2 then assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, now commissioner of the depart- ment of correction of New York City, who officially visited all of the prisons and adult reformatories in the United States. In the chapter of this yearbook entitled Resume of Progress, MacCormick indicates t.he improvement which has taken place since his survey. The fact that there are prisons and reformatories where .today the education program is weal: or nonexistant, although regret- 'Proceedings, American Prison Association, 1920, ff., New York City 2MacCor~nick, Austin H., The Education of Adult Prisoners, National Society of Penal Information, New York, 1931 table, is not surprising because inertia in this movement, as in most departures from pattern thought, is generally deep-rooted and slow to yield to change. The national parole conference which met in Washington, D. C., April 1939, recommended among other things, that all prison sentences should be indeterminate rather than definite. This recommendation, when carried into effect, will throw additional obligations upon those responsible for the education of prisoners. A less definite time allotment of'commitment demands an acceler- ated activity of the rehabilitating prison agencies. From the time a man is committed to prison and becomes a subject of study by the state classification committee, up to and including the time of his parole, and even during the time of his parole supervision until his release, his individual welfare must be the cooperative responsibility of all agencies within and without the educational staff. The largest measure of this responsibility, including guidance, falls to the role of education. The Purpose of Correctional Education The organization of a prison educational program should be for the purpose of helping inmates to improve their status. This broad definition would include instruction for those who need to acquire fundamentals which they never possessed, to review fundamentals to which they had previously been exposed but which they never adequately learned, or to acquire new knowledge either in the field of trades and industries or life enrichment interests that might assist them while incarcerated to better utilize their time, and which will prepare them for social efficiency within the institution and on parole. The prescription of needed instruction should, of course, keep constantly to the front the fact that sooner or later more than ninety per cent of all inmates will again go forth into civil life. Instruction that will make n prisoner a ,more desirable parolee should be a requirement. It should not be forgotten that elemen- tary arithmetic, legible writing, simple spelling, ability to report an accident orally or in writing are quite as important as trade or machine skills. An optimum rehabilitation program should include all elements that will lessen the antisocial sentiment among those who are to be treated. 40 Correctional Education Today A Good Classification System is Essential to Effective Educational Administration The administration of an educational program is to a great degree dependent upon an adequate classification system. This is true both on a state-wide basis and within each individual institution. If an educational program is to be more than a hit-or-miss procedure, there must be compctent classification and segregation of prisoners. A state-wide classification system of prisoners under unit control, with prisons classified to participate in the treatment program in terms of their respective ability, makes possible the segregation of prisoners according to need, and therefore lays the basis of a sound educational program. Departmental-wide classification is now practiccd by our Federal Bureau of Prisons, and by the depart- ments of correction in a few of our more populous states. In 'general, the central classification procedure should determine the type of custody needed for the man and also the type of program which will probably contribute best to his rehabilitation. Whether or not it is possible to set up a central classification agency, each institution should have a well organized classification system in order to plan a program of treatment for the individual inmate. A chapter of this Yearbook deals with the classification of inmates for education; in that chapter the detailed procedures which should be followed in the classification system are discussed. It is, therefore, not necessary to describe here the various tests, techniques, interviews, and other procedures of such a system. TO summarize this procedure, it should be emphasized that at the close of the quarantine or classification period, the prisoner's case history should be completed, his physical, mental, and emotional appraise- mcnt made, and the remedial program outlin~d. The important aspects of classification from the standpoint of the administration of the educational program in an institution, is that there should be close cooperation between the two agencies. The director of education should be held responsible for interviewing the innlate and summarizing his educational possibilities, needs, and interests. The educational director should be a member of the classification board and should have the opportunity and responsi- bility, on a par with other members of the institutional staff, of participating in outlining each man's program. i Organization and Administration of Education 41 Institutional Administration and The Educational Program The support and the cooperation of the administrative officers of an institution are basic to the development of an educational pro- gram. Wallack, in his book, The Training of Prison Guards, states that, \"No matter how well the professional task of education in an institution might be organized or provided for materially, outcomes of maximum value could not result unless the administrative policy of an institution provides for the integration of all treatment services toward their common objective, that is, the rehabilitated inmate.\"3 While the cooperation of institutional officials is essen- tial, it is perhaps even more basic that the officials of the department having jurisdiction over the institution be in sympathy with and give support to the development of education. In order to secure sound, continuous development of an educa- tional program there should be an individual or group of individuals in the office of the controlling agency in the state whose responsi- bility it is to direct and supervise the educational program in all institutions. Within each institution there should be a director of education and two supervisors; one supervisor should have charge of the social or general education program, the other should be responsible for the vocational education program. The director of education in each institution should, as is the case in the State of New York, be directly responsible to the warden or superintendent of the institution for the development of the educational program. The director is also responsible to the state director of prison edu- cation in matters demanding professional leadership and technical direction. The director and supervisors should be fully qualified in their particular fields with special training in educational adminis- tration and supervision. The administration of each prison school, then, must be under professional educational leadership. The staffing of each prison school should be under the direction of the state director of prison education and only those civilians who can meet the professional requirements should be employed. The state commissioner should hold the personnel of each prison, from the warden to the lowest ranking employee, to strict accountability for cooperation in the approved educational program which has been prepared at his recommendation by the state director of education by and with the assistance of all professional co-workers. 3Wallack, Walter hf., The Training of Prison Guards, Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, 1938, p. 18. / Correctional Education Today Administratively, every civilian employed in a prison program should be competent, and sympathetic to the philosophy of re- habilitation, or be replaced. Prisons cannot be staffed by incom- petents or political favorites, with tenure changing with the tide of political fortune and provide more than security, which was and is the only function under the old punitive idea: Accepting that each prison system should be divorced from politics, that all per- sonnel should be selected on a merit basis, and that tenure following probation should be secure with removal only for cause, it follows that no person should be retained unless his philosophy of treat- ment is sympathetic and his cooperation is whole-hearted and sincere. The director of education and the educational supervisors have the following responsibilities: The organization of the educational program; the selection and continuous revision of the curriculum; personnel training; supervision of all teaching; developing coopera- tion with all other departments of the institution; organizing and directing the guidance program; and maintaining satisfactory records and reports. The Teaching Staff Depending upon the amount of money available for instructional purposes, the entire teaching staff should, insofar as possible, be civilians. Financial requirements might make it necessary to use a combination of civilian and inmate instructors; or in some cases where there is bold and competent leadership, it might be possible to use only inmate instructors. A staff of all inmate instructors, unless under the supervision of a competent, professional, civilian leader, is very likely to miss the objective, of the rehabilitation program. Anyone acquainted with prison procedure knows that it is practically impossible to administer a worth-while educational program without professional civilian leadership. The philosophy of all instructors, whether inmate or civilian, should be primarily the welfare of the individual student, and the chief consideration his educational growth. All instructors should be skilled not only in subject matter but also in adult teaching and be capable of par- ticipating in counseling clinics. Organization and Administration of Education 43 Organizing the Educational Program Before detcrrnining what activities shall be included in a program I of education or the form in which they shall be organized, several preliminary steps must be taken. First, surveys should be made of the educational possibilities of the institution. Second, the characteristics of the inmates confined in the institution should be carefully analyzed. Third, the personnel and physical facilities available for carrying on the program must be surveyed. Only after a careful analysis of these factors can a sound program of education be organized for any institution. School opportunities within an institution may be either required or optional. Opinion differs on this point. Believing that the wel- fare of the state demands as a very minimum a knowledge of the common school subjects by each individual, it is the opinion of this writer that attendance at prison schools should be required of all who are illiterate in English. We further assert that it mould be to the benefit of the individual prisoner, and to society as a whole, to further require attendance at school until, in the judgment of the school authorities, the inmate has attained the equivalent of a common-school, sixth grade education. We would recommend that optional attendance be the policy above the equivalent of the sixth grade. This writer also advocates compulsory attendance in prescribed trade and industry courses for selected inmates. The fact that a small percentage of prisoners are foreign-born and may be literate in their own language but illiterate in English, while other foreign-speaking as well as some native-born prisoners might be altogether illiterate, leads to the recommendatiorl that, in the organization of a prison school, there should be a beginning group. The teachers of these beginning groups must proceed largely with individualized instruction. Unlike the problem of teaching beginning children, the adult has had many life esperiences of which a skilIed teacher can take advantage in his teaching efforts. Work in the beginning classes should be only of such length as is required to develop the inmate student to approximately s third grade ability level. At that time, he can with profit be placed in a departmental- izcd school. Departrncntalized instruction is recommended for all those who are of approsinlately third grade reading ability. It is recognized that because of previous esperience, including informal education, no two adults long remain on the same ability level. In order to 44 Correctional Education Today cope with this lack of homogeneity, it is recommended that the calendar year for prison schools be divided into four quarters, that each quartcr comprise twelve to twelve and one-half weeks of instruction, and the remainder of the quarter of one half week to one xeek be devoted to readjusting student assignments to meet changed ability levels. This plan has been working satisfactorily at Sing Sing for the past year. The instructors, whether civilian or inmate, should with the guidance of the local prison supervisor consider the assignments, abilities, needs, and attitudes of each individual student. The prescription in each subject for the next quarter should be in terms of the student's need and ability. Experience in administering such a school for inmates has con- clusiveIy demonstrated that adult inmates in departmentalized group instruction will seldom develop uniformly in all assignments, and that it is not infrequent to have a student accelerated in one subject and retarded in another; such discovery calls for counseling between the instructors and the supervisors with possibly some special individualized assignments for remedial purposes. One of the great difficulties in the organization of an adult institutional school is the lack of proper textbooks and teaching materials. Frequently texts, inherited from some public school af tcr they have become obsolete, are used. Where possible, materials prepared especially for adults should be obtained or developed. Workbooks prepared especially for adults which can be used with or without specific textbooks have been found highly useful in a number of schools where elementary subjects are taught to adult^.^ A further value of the workbook procedure lies in the fact that the highly interested and capable student is not held back, even between the short periods of the school terms, by the slow student, nor is the slow student unnecessakily accelerated. Inci- dentally, such workbooks prove of great aid in the cell-study program for those inmates whose institutional duties make it necessary for them to acquire school advantages through corre- spondence either wholly or in part. Every industry within or without the prison in which inmates participate should be a demand upon the school for instruction which makes it possible for those tasks to be more skillfully and intelligently done. Briefly, the trade and industry education pos- $Life Enrichment Correspondence Study Series Prepared Especially for Adults, edited by A. A. Ilced and C. K. Morse, published by the University Exten- sion Djvjsio~l of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. 1 i ~~~anization and Administration of Education 45 sible in a prison school involves the teaching of technical informa- tion and slulls for each of the respective activities. For example, every penal institution must have cooks, bakers, butchers, and waiters. Every prison school should offer instructional assistance to these and all other workers within the institution. Not only should the prison school in its organization offer instruction in each of the various activities and industries carried on within its walls, but it should also offer instruction to selected groups in the other trades and industries for which the parole field workers find there is a demand and an opportunity for placement. Such inte- gration of the findings of the parole field workers with the services of the prison school will aid in promoting interest and efficiency. Excellent suggestive materials and, in some cases, manuals for trades and industries are available from the army, navy, and marine corps. For example, the army has an excellent manual which is the principal text in their formal professional school for cooks and bakers. In all, there are more than fifty crafts for which excellent suggestive materials and tentative outlines of courses have been developed by the above agencies. Courses in some of the subjects ordinarily taught in our American high schools should be offered to groups who can profit by such study. Practically all courses on the high school level, as well as non-laboratory courses on the college and university levels, are available for credit through recognized correspondence divisions of various higher institutions of learning.6 In a great many prisons, there is an over-supply of labor, and in such institutions the organization of a \\~ork-study program can possibly absorb into useful activity all inmates who are now idle. Such a plan administratively requires that men who are now on full-time tasks who can profitably be enrolled in an educational course or courses be assigned to half time at their tasks and half time to study of such subjects as counselors find they need. At the same time, part-time work and part-time study can be given to those who are now idle, thus dividing the taslis without loss of labor efficiency, and malung it possible for dl to have educational advan- tages and an opportunity for rehabilitation. 6A cross index of the correspondence courses offered by the member institutions of the National Universit,~ Extension Association may be had without charge by making rcqucst through thc secretary, Professor W. S. Bitner, of the University Extension Division, University of Indiana, Bloomington, Indiana. 46 Correctional Education Today Organization and Administration oj Education 47 There may be some prisons where, because of a shortage of men, the industries are undermanned. ..In such institutions, we assert that the foremost obligation of the prison administrator is not to exploit the prisoner but to take every possible means to speed his rehabili- tation for reentry into civil life. Educational Administrative Procedures Budget Management Far too many educational programs in correctional institutions are still operating with no fixed budgets. Paper, pencils, and other supplies are often secured only through the cooperation of some other department. All other sdpplies and equipment are secured in any way possible, with large dependence upon donations from the outside and the good will of the heads of other departments of the institution. In order to operate efficiently, the institutional education director should be required to prepare an estimate of the needs of the educa- tional department for the coming year. When the institution bud- get is prepared, the director of education should be notified as to the amount which he mill be allowed to spend for his department during the year. It is possible under such a plan to know whether to figure on expanding the program or whether it will be necessary to restrict . educational activities. Definite program planning is thereby made possible and the educational program can be planned as a steady growth rather than jerking along by the hand-to-mouth procedure now followed in so many institutions. The management of the cducational budget requires an accurate accounting of funds spent for education and year-round recording of qeeds as they come to the attention of the educational personnel. Records and Reports The cducational department should maintain an adequate and well organized system of records. One indication of efficient man- agemcrlt is the ability to produce information which may be called for by the head of the institution or which may be needed in the regular functioning of the educational program. The Department of Correction of New York State has recently instituted a system of educational forms to be used in the internal administration of education in the institutions of the Department. The following titles of these reports indicate the types of records which should be maintained by the institutional educational depart- ment : Schedule of Classes and ~ctivities Reception Interview~ducetional Daily Enrollment Report Teachers Quarterly Report of Daily Attendance Teachers Quarterly Report of Inmate Progress in VocationaI Activities Teachers Quarterly Report of Inmate Progress in Non-Voca- tional Activities Individual Record of Cell Study Permanent Record of Cell Study Permanent Record of Inmate Educational Accomplishment Teachers Lesson Plan Educational Director, Head Teacher, or Supervisor Class Supervison Record Vocational Trade Analysis Progress Record Improving Instruction The improvement of instruction constitutes the most important function of the educational director and his supervisors. The improvement of instruction includes such things as teacher train- ing, curriculum development, and the supervision of instruction in the various educational activities. The need for improving instruc- tion and consequently the amount of time and energy to be devoted to it varies somewhat with the type of teaching staff available. In institutions where a staff of well trained, capable, civilian instructors is employed, the director of education's function in improving instruction consists mainly in stimulating, initiating, and guiding instructional activities, curriculum development, and the prepara- tion of instructional materials. However, where dependence must be placed upon inmate instructors, much closer supervision is necessary and teacher training must be comprehensive beginning with the fundamentals of educational philosophy and psychology and developing the various techniques of teaching. Very few inmate teachers are available who have any training or esperience in teaching; therefore, if teaching is to be effective, a continuous program of teacher training is a vital necessity. The common practice in many institutions today appears to be to select inmates with a fair basic education, to give them in a brief interview a general idea of what they are to teach, and to turn them loose in 48 Correctional Education Today the classrooms. Any further training usually occurs only when the teacher encounters serious difficulties which are brought to the attention of the educational director for correction. Some insti- tutions, however, are making a real effort to train inmate teachers. For example, the Woodbourne Institution for Defective Delin- ' quents, selected and trained a group of inmate teachers before %opening their school in 1934. The director of education compiled a teacher training manual which was used with the beginning group and which subsequent inmate teachers study before going into the classrooms. Some institutions use the plan of holding regular inmate teacher training meetings every Saturday morning. Prob- ably, with the use of some ingenuity, every director of education can find a way to carry on this important aspect of the program. Interviews with Inmates Another function of educational administration which ranks alongside the improvement of instruction in importance is the interviewing of inmates. While interviews consume considerable time they form such a vital part of the work of the educational staff, that every effort should be made to increase their effective- ness. The educational director, by virtue of his position and especially if he is an understanding person, will be sought out by inmates who will bring to him every sort of problem from those of a trivial nature to those of the most personal significance. Inter- views must be held to plan the individual program of the inmate, to effect necessary changes in the program, to discuss changes desired by the inmate, to straighten out difficulties which arise from time to time between inmates or between inmates and their instructors, to check up on the educational piogress which the in- mate is making, to secure data for compiling parole reports, and miscellaneous interviews to discuss problems which inmates them- selves bring to t,he educational office. Considerable skill is necessary in conducting interviews if they are to bring definite results and if they are not to be too time-consuming. The educational director could well afford to study certain sources in social casework where the techniques of interviewing have been highly developed. . One basic procedure which the educational director should establish is to see that requests for interviews are given prompt attention and t,hat anything promised or decided in an interview is put into effect r~ithout unnecessary delay. If these principles are not followed Organization and Administration of Education inmates become discouraged when they hear nothing from their requests, lose interest and build up a resentful attitude toward the entire education21 program. Integrating Education with the Entire Institutional Program A basic principle in educationa1 administration in a correctiona1 institution is that the educational staff must work smoothly and harmoniously with all other departments of the institution. With- out such a working relationship, the effectiveness of the educational program is almost nullified. The educational director must display considerable tact, common sense, and ingenuity in building these relationships. The educational staff must employ the following procedures if the educational program is to have a sound founda- tion: Demonstrate the value of the educational program by the quality of work done in it and the effect it has upon inmates and I the institution; organize and administer the program e\u00a3Eciently; show a willingness to cooperate with other institutional officials; demonstrate an understanding of the problems of other depart- ments. The educational department has certain relationships with almost every other department of the institution: Plans must be worked out whereby men can be released from industry or maintenance shops for attendance at school. Maintenance shops also often supply needed materials for school use. The psychiatrist or psy- chologist should supply the necessary histories of the men attending school if the school is to plan individual programs. It has been stated above that the educational director should be a member of . the classification board. his' position offers many opportunities to build up proper relationships with various members of the staff. Situations can be found where, although very good psychiatric and psychological testing is done, the educational department never receives the results of such tests. Such a situation usually indicates lacli of planning or poor personal relationships and much of the responsibility rests upon the director of educntion. A working relationship must be established with the parole department if inmate educational programs are to be plnrlned so that they will function most effectively when the inmate is released. Further- { more, the education:tl department can be helpful to the parole department by supplying accurate, definite information as to the 50 Correctional Education Today Organization and Administration of Education 5 1 achievement and attitudes of inmates while in attendance at the educational program. It is highly important that the educational department secure the respect and good will of the guards whose close contact with inmates puts them in position to boost or \"knock\" the school to inmates under their supervision. Without the cooper- ation of the storekeeper and steward, it is difficult to secure needed supplies and equipment. Most important of all, of course, is the establishment of proper relationships with the chief administrative officer of the institution and his assistant. If the educational director expects to secure the support of his warden or superinten- dent, he must demonstrate that he knows where he hopes to take the educational program, that he can plan definitely and clearly, and that he can administer an educational program which will bring definite results. The assistant superintendent or principal keeper usually has the major responsibility for the placement and supervision of all inmates. For this reason the educational director must have his cooperation in order to get inmates assigned to school, to secure the proper type of officers to supervise the discipline of the school where this practice is followed, and to secure the establish- ment of many of the procedures necessary to the efficient organiza- tion and operation of the school. These are a few of the many and varied relationships which must be developed by the director of education. In order to be effective, then, the institution director of education must put first things first, plan his work carefully, and distribute his time and energy so that steady progress will result. Otherwise, he will become lost in routine and petty details and sink to the level of a glorified office boy. Utilizing Other Institutional Agencies for Education Today the radio is putting on the air programs of varying interest and merit. These programs present an opportunity for the educa- tion of prisoners by careful choosing of programs through central control sets where the institutions are so equipped. The selection of such programs should be the responsibility of the director of education. Many worth-while opportunities through the agency of radio are offered for integrating inmate lifc with the march of progress in the outside world. Making available radio programs of sporting events and news broadcasts, including some of the more popular regular con~n~ercial programs and international programs on nation-wide hook-ups, gives the prisoner a mental parole into outside activities-a necessary educational step to keep him abreast with what the outside world is doing. A majority of prisons today have excellent motion picture pro- jectors. The selection of films for both instruction and entertain- ment should be an additional obligation of the director of prison education. Their purpose should be to afford the integration of the moving drama of life and outside interests with that of inmates temporarily confined and denied freedom. Industrial and com- mercial films offer an opportunity for enriching the understanding not only of institutional dutics and industries but also outside industries. Films are not the only source of visual education. Maps, charts and every device that helps the human eye to better comprehend fall in this classification. In these times, when the map of the world is undergoing frequent changes, excellent motive is offered to prisoner students to make a large mall map and keep the same constantly up-to-date. Another group of students can draw a large state wall map and keep upon it weather and crop reports. Such projects offer the possibility of extra-curricular participation. Few are the prisons that do not have libraries. These libraries in many cases are neither adjacent to nor under the supervision of the supervisors of education. The management of a worth-while prison library, like that of a school or public library, is sufficiently complicated to call for a trained librarian. The librarian and the library should, however, be a part of the prison educational plant. The educational staff should suggest to the librarian subjects of study and give him the opportunity to suggest books, periodicals, and other library materials that would be of value in such study. There should be the closest integration between prison school authorities and the librarian for the purpose of encouraging and promoting library patronage and creating nrorth-~vliilc reading interests. Insofar as possible, opportunity for becoming acquainted with library opportunites and materials should be made available to prisoncrs in order that the possession of such knowledge may provc of value to them ~vhcn thcy return to civil life. It is highly important that students in the prison school should learn how to find materials in libraries, which skill they can utilize on the out- side.' ; i 7S1efkcs, Ruth Long, and Morse, C.

Prisoners, like free citizens, go to school to their environment. Library service that is sufficient and ade- quate under sliilled persons offers even within prison walls excellent cnvironmcntal opportunities, as well as desirable habit-forming attitudes which are a part of the rehabilitation process. .4n ade- quate prison library has the drawback that its proper management tnkcs money. -1 prison library, like a frce public library, must have furids for books, bulletins, and periodicals. Many of the bulletins that an institutional library mould wish to possess may be secured frce upon request. Certainly for prisoners who expect to return to agriculture, a file and indexing of the United States Department of Agriculture bulletins are at once a source of knowledge and interest. Tlic purchase of library material, including books and periodicals should ha\\-c a liberal budget allowance, and should be recommended by the prison educational staff in order that the library may be integrated with tlie prison educational program. A record of the individual prisoner's reading requests and experience should be kcpt. Means of checking the reading interests and reading habits of prisoners should be an important consideration. Personnel Training The more efficicnt the job of rehabilitation, the more adequate must be the staff with an emphasis on merit appointments and security of tenure. Well-organized courses for prison personnel are carried on in the Federal institutions and in those of New York State. We suggest that training courses be initiated by all political units or arrangements made so that all personnel may be trained in one of the more progressive training schools of another political unit. The integration of all prison personnel in the rehabili- tation program ill come only when a11 staff members are not only competent and sympathetic, but are trained in the philosophy of the obligation and opportunity of the modern prison. Public Opinion Must Be Informed The public will bccome interested more and more in the worth- whilcness of the modern prison program when they become aware that prisons are hospitals for the socially maladjusted. The public needs to be continually informed of the objectives of the American Organization and Administration of Education 53 Prison Association. Laymen need to understand that supervised parole is cheaper on tllc taxpayer's pocketbook than maintenance of the same prisoner in an institution. The public must not be allowed to forget that the prison needs to be made ~vhole.somc and that prisoners should, as rapidly as their respective cases permit, be made ready by education, both formal and informal, for re-entry into civil life. Prison management must possess a forward-looking program to the end that paroled or discharged prisoners may be better enabled to meet the requirements of parole elnployment and thereby bccome self-supporting members of society. Summary The administration of an cducational program in n correctional institution calls for an individual nit11 a broad background, wide experience, deep insight into human nature, tact, perserverance, imagination, and patience. He must be able to meet successfully unusual situations and must possess thc ingenuity necessary to find solutions to difficult problems. No time-server nor dock-watcher, nor one who is easily upset can meet the requirements. Above all, the educational director must bc a leader. He must exhibit initia- tive and drive if education is to secure the important place which it merits in the institutional treatment program. Inertia and tradi- tion are so strong in correctional institutions that an educational director who is easily cowed or discouraged is doomed to failure from the start. He must be able and willing to state the case for education clearly and to maintain his position. At the same time he must avoid creating undue antagonism by any show of trucu- lence or lack of consideration for the rights and opinions of other institutional personnel. A weakling gains neither respect nor active cooperation; a bigot mill find himself blocked at every turn. Alert, determined leadership gains respect and cooperation and insures sound continuous progress. To one who succeeds in overcoming the essential difficultics and organizing a functionirig educational program, the work is fascinnting and the compensations are many. In fact, few positions offcr the opportunities for genuine social service and the personal satisfaction which can be found in suc- cessfully organizing and administering a program of correctional education. 54 Correctional Education Today BIBLIOGRAPHY Books CHAPTER IV Doll, Edgar A.

Yepsen Director, Division of Classification and Education Department of Institutions and Agencies Trenton, N. J. ClassMcation is Essential to, Modem Penal Treatment Today criminology and penology are essentially part of a science which can be called human engineering. Much of what is done today in this field is the result of careful study, experimentation and research. The result of this is that offenders against society are being more effectively handled by long-time custody, special treatment, or return to society after a program of rehabilitation. -4s in other fields which have progressed from the art stage, it .is to be seen that the body of facts necessarily basic to a science is rapidly accumulating regarding crime and offenders so that crimi- nology and penology have reached a stage in their development when these facts assume importance. Care must be taken, however, to see that both the philosophy and the methods of handling the problems of the offender take into account the kaleidoscopic changes which are taking place continuously and which have been particularly prominent during the past few years. If the present-day treatment of offenders is to be effective for society, and at the same time build a structure which miill enable future penologists to deal successfully with the problems which will be theirs, pace must be kept with the changes. In order to do this, it is necessary to deveIop a methodology or technique which will be flexible enough to make all the adaptations. There is little doubt but that in the past t~venty years there has been developed a n~ethodology which can meet thcse changes, namely, classification. While studies hnve sho~vn that the mass of men in prisons does not differ grcstly from the mass of men outaside prison walls, we are faced with the problem that aIthough man's native equipment docs not change much in scvcrnl gencrations-or centurics-the situation in which he uses that equipment changes trcrnendously. Man, any man, not onlyba man who is or has been in prison, must 56 Correctio~lal Education Today be equipped by training that he may meet satisfactorily the prob- lem situations in which he finds himself. Training permits the individual to use to the maximum advantage his native equipment, and, while not a guarantee of social and economic effectiveness, docs much to enable him to become a socially and economically sufficient individual. KO one will question the fact that although the men in prison do not differ greatly from the men who are not in prison, the man- ner in which the characteristics of the individual are balanced is son~enhat different for the man who has failed to adjust in society. That this \"syn~ptom complex\" is different for the offender than for the non-offender, is not peculiar to the offender group. It is prob- able that similar differences would also be found when the individual members of any handicapped or special group is compared with the rion-handicapped or non-special group. There are exaggerations and deficiencies in the individual's characteristics which are the variables differentiating individuals. The greater the refinement of study the greater the diffcrences will be found to be. Following study by specialists, treatment through rehabilitation can bring individuals into balance. Prison administrators have shown repeatedly their desire to return men and women to society better able to get along in the social stream than they did before they were sentenced to the institution. In order to do this, the administrator must use the most modern and adaptable techniques available. The three major purposes of the prison are well known, namely, 1. The protection of society. 2. The rehabilitation of the offender, and 3. Punishment by deprivation of liberty. It is a simple matter of custody, of walls, iron bars, and other deterrents to satisfy the first and third purpose. The adoption of precautionary measures to prevent the escape of the offender and his return to society are relatively simple matters. Having adopted these precautionary measures, the man is automatically deprived of his liberty for the period of time determined by the court or other sentencing agency IIOIY existing, or which may be developed. If that were the prisons' only duty, they ~vould be praised by public officials and citizens alike as being well-managed and worthy of unlimited support. But the obligation of the prison administrator is much greater tlinn tllc obvious duty of keeping its prisoners safely behind walls. 1nc:~rccration alone is not a crime deterrent for many offenders, although deprivation of liberty has through the ages proved to be ! Classification of Inmates for Education a deterrent subsequent to discharge in some cases. With many offenders it may achieve just an opposite effect and may in fact cause an embitterment against society \\vhicll will be productive of further asocial acts upon the release of the offender to the com-' munity. Such an effect is more probable when due to the lack of a constructive program, the corrosive effect of imprisonment is accentuated by the contacts made possible through the peculiar population of a prison and by unintelligent administration. Life behind prison walls rarely approximates normal society. Pcrhaps in a way it is fortunate that more than one half of the men who are sent to penal and correctional institutions throughout the country do not remain in those institutions more than two years. That period of time, however, may be sufficient to be productive of negative results unless the program is intelligently developed and effectively administered. When it is realized that considerably . more than 95 per cent of the men received in prison are later returned to the community, it is readily seen that every available means at the disposal of the prison should be used to further protect society by giving its prisoners the skills, the discipline, and the training essential to successful community life. The prison ad- ministrator must adopt a program which plans for the offender's release to society from the day he was received at the institution, and one which aims to work with him intensively until he is suc- cessfully rehabilitated in the community. In fact, many authorities have come to believe that rehabilitation should start, not at the time of his reception at the institution, but that the actual sentenc- ing procedure should be incorporated in the whole program of re- habilitation. Rehabilitation or re-education is the third major purpose of the prison. The two previously mentioned major purposcs are no doubt successfully provided for in practically every pcnsl and correctional institution. Rehabilitation is simply re-education. Education in its broadest sense, must be effective in every section of the in~titut~ion, and sho~ld motivate every activity within the institution. Education is a continuous process. It is something which cnn and does operate throughout the individual's entire life. The fact that the human can learn is one of his most hopeful charac- tcristics. This characteristic provides the basis for those who are interested in rehabilitation of offenders as well as the rehabilitatio~l or re-education of any special group. Education within the prison 58 Correctional Education Today is not different, basically, from education any place else. In its . broadest sense education means not only the learning of new activi- ties but the unlearning of old ones as well. It means not only the acquisition of new knowledge and the development of new skills and new attitudes, but in the case of the offender, it means that the additional knowledge, the new skills, and the changed attitudes must all be so combined that the individual's adjustment to society will be an effective one. Classification is Based on Getting the Facts About the Individual Inmate A good classification system in a penal program is one which has as its goal a re-educated or rehabilitated offender. It is a well planned, adequately staffed, properly supervised, and well inte- grated system of individual study. It is primarily a case work technique applied to this phase of human problems. As is true in all types of case work, it utilizes the services of specialists who can, by reason of their background and training, help in the under- standing of the individual. In the development of the classification system, modern penology has made a very real contribution which offers the means for a frontal attack upon the problem of the offender. The classification system provides the prison adminis- trator and his entire staff with a composite picture of the offender which identifies him as an individual with a history and back- ground and a set of characteristics which are almost as individual as are his finger-prints. These fit no other person. The study of the assets and the liabilities of the offender and the machinery to capitalize on the assets and to supply the deficiencies are basic to education in penal institutions, as it is seen today. If education in penal institutions is to make any real progress, it will be made only in those situations in which individual study is possible. This study of the individual can be divided into four general sections; (a) custody; (b) special treatment; (c) training; (d) relcasc. All of these are of distinct importance in relation to the develop- ment and maintenance of the educational program within the institution. Though the fields of study may appear to be quite separate, they arc in reality very much interrelated and it is this intcrrclationship on which it is possible to capitalize in the indi- vidual study. Classification of Inmates for Education At first, it may seem that when the type of custody that a man needs is determined, the first and primary requirement of the penal system is satisfied and the incarceration likewise provides the punishment that is deemed necessary by deprivation of liberty. The determination of the special treatment needed and the train- ing that the individual man requires are the peculiar contributions of classification as it is in use in a large number of modern penal systems. The fundamental philosophy of the scheme known as classification is well known, for it was developed and proceeds on the well founded assumption that no individual possesses the ability, either native or acquired, to determine the whole program for any other individual. While this applies peculiarly to the offender who is in prison, it likewise applies otherwise. In developing the body of facts which are basic to the promul- gation of a rehabilitation program, it is necessary that there should be a specialized study of each prisoner. This should be carried out by individuals who, by reason of their training and experience, are well able to recognize the individual's traits and needs. The strength of classification lies not in the skeleton or framework, which is relatively simple, but in the personnel whose responsibility it is to make separate studies from the standpoint of their own specialty and in getting this information across to the institution staff. Good Classification Demands Investigation by Specialists Briefly described, the following are the fields of inquiry and in each one are many of t,he basic facts which will make for the development of an effective program of education within the prison, looking forward to the day of the prisoner's release to society. Previous History This information is usually supplied by a well trained parole officer, or it may be submitted in part by the probation depart- ment and supplemented by the parole officer. The probation departments are being called upon more and more to furnish this information to courts prior to sentence. This material should include (a) criminal record; (b) family background; (c) school history; (d) sl~ccial occupational com- munity adjustment; (g) con~mllnity and neighborhood factors; (h) special notes regarding particular problems. It is rcadily sccn that more than onc meniber of thc classification committee will 60 Correctional Education Today Classifimtion of Inmates for Education 6 1 find in this history information which will be of great value to him in the better understanding of the offender from the point of view of his own specialty. The fact must not be overlooked, however, that this history tclls of the individual as he was seen in the com- munity and in the territory to which he will no doubt return. The findings determined in the examination of the individual himself are to be related to this community casualty described in the history. The story could be written about anyone, but in the case of the prisoner it is written with the special point of view of enabling anyone reading it to understand how and determine why he got into difficulties. Physical Examination This is a comprehensive physical examination made by a com- petent physician. The examination should be made in such a way t,hat it will reveal the special physical conditions needing remedial treatmcnt. Thc ordinary routine physical examination has no place in a prison system which plans to utilize the results of the physician's findings in prcparing the individual to go into society again. Studies have. been made n-hich show that offenders have a greater number of physical disorders than would be found in the same number of individuals in t.he average population. Certain of these are no doubt the type which may make adjustment difficult, and because of the highly specialized field of the physician, great responsibility rests upon hiin. In order that a man may have a healthy body free from as many defects as it is possible to free him, the physician must be provided with or have immediately available all the necessary apparatus for specialized examinations and treatment. Mental Condition This is an examination conducted by a physician trained in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric conditions as a specialty. His contribution to the better understanding of the prisoner, and tlicrefore, the better educational program and treatment, will lie in his detcction of actual and incipient mental disease conditions. I-Ic will also give information of importance to every member of the classificution committee regarding the man's mental \"quirks\" which make him an individual problem. It is not sugicient that he should classify or label the offender, using psychiatric terminology. He must indicaie hat that means regarding the handling of the individual in the institlctiontil colnnzunity and on release and must be prepared to treat the nwiz i?zdiridualLy, if it is possible to do so. Mental Equipment, Interests, Aptitudes and Attitudes This examination and study is carried out- by a competent, qualified psychologist, trained in the field of individual examina- tion. His contribution should be that of determining as accurately as possible the native mental ability of the individual, his pre- dominant interests, his basic attitudes, and his special aptitudes for training. The job is not to determine simply mental level. That can be done by a clerk or psychometrist. He must determine and evaluate in a competent manner those factors which are so . basic in the re-education program which is being developed. The objectivity of the work of the psychologist makes possible reex- amination, which yields objective data which may be used for accurate comparison. Educational Although the entire examination made in the process of classi- fication should be from the point of view of education, here is a study made by a person specially trained in the field of education. The examination should be made for the purpose of determining the individual's assets and deficiencies from the standpoint of the field of education. He should utilize the most modern objective means and determine the man's needs and capabilit.ies for special- ized educational training, that is, further schooling on the basis of his own data and the data of the psychologist. Trade Training This is a study made by a person trained along industrial lines. Insofar as it is possible, he should utilize available techniques for determining the individual's actual trade knowledge and efficiency. It is readily seen that this becomes of great importance when plan- ning the educational program. Disciplinary This information is obtained by a person experienced in penal work who is capable of evaluating a man from the standpoint of thc amount of and type of discipline he mill nccd. In some respects, this may bc largcly subjective, for, as yct, thcre has been little developed which is objectivc. His evaluation, however, has real importance in the whole study. 62 Correctional Education Today Classification of Inmates for Education 63 Group Life and Social Relations It is estremely advisable that a study should be made by a person trained in the field of sociological interpretations. Classification for education must of necessity take into account the individual as a social being, and quite naturally proceeds on the basis of facts in this as in other areas. Administration IVhcnever possible the man is interviewed by the superintendent himself; if that is not possible, he should always be seen by someone who is known to be a representative of the superintendent. This has the advantage of bringing the prisoner in actual contact with the adn~inistrative head of the institution, who, more than anyone else, is interested in his welfare and growth. The Facts must be Summarized and Pooled ' In the opcration of classification, each of the specialists submits his own complete report. In some systems it is customary for the specialist to summarize his report, while in others summarization is made by the person who is in charge of classification and who, by reason of his training and background, is able to abstract the material without losing any of the essential features in the findings. These summaries are then made available and a classification sum- mary report is made in sufficient numbers to give each member of the classification committee a copy.. Likewise sufficient copies are supplied to other agencies such as the central supervisory agency, and in some instances copies are returned to interested judges. When all this information is available, and within an optimum time limit which is determined according to the individual situa- tion, the classification committee meets to cpnsider the offender and to develop the program. At this meeting there is opportunity for the interchange of findings and ideas to the end that the proper program can be developed for the individual while he is in the institution. Somc of the advantages of the use of the classification system have frequently been overlooked. For cxample it will be found that all facilities of the prison system will be utilized to their best advantage and to the advantage of the prisoner. Then, too, the problems of prison management are certain to become less involved and less complcx. From the standpoint of the latter consideration alone a classificstion system is justified. The program of individual study aims to capitalize the assets and supply the deficiencies of the individual man. It is at this meeting that integration is made of all the individual reports, for without this integration, classification as an effective medium would not be possible. Classification very definitely means that the institutional program will be one of comparative precision based upon scientific findings rather than mere guess work. The program which is de- veloped should be profitable to the inmate to the end that he will have benefitted in a positive way by his stay. ' A First Result of Classification Should be Transfer of the Inmate to the Proper Type of Institution The modern penal system consists of a number of units providing diversified types of custody. This is a real factor in the educational program, for the proper type of physical plant facilitates the proper functioning of the training program. Individuals may be grouped together who have common backgrounds, common characteristics, and common needs. The men who are in the various units are more like each other than they are like those in another group. For example, in the maximum security institutions are housed those of the confirmed criminal type; that is, those who have long crim- inal records or whose offenses and examinations indicate a lack of stability, judgment and reliability. The medium security institu- tions or units house those whose charges may be of a less serious nature, but who may be recidivists and those who are nearing the date of their release. In nearing the date of their release, their needs are different, as may be determined on the basis of classifica- tion studies, and a medium security institution can bridge the gap between incarceration and freedom to a better degree. To those men, housing alone may have a real educative value prior to their time of release. The minimum security institutions generally receive first offend- ers and accidental offenders and other favorable types. These are men who are different from others in that they require different handling, and their outlook for subsequent adjustment is much more favorable. Society owes them their opportunities to succeed as quickly as possible when released from the institution. There are certain other special types which can and should be provided for since tllcir removal from the main group of prisoners will make tlie educationnl.prograxn more positive. These include 66 Correctional Education Today Classification of Inmates jor Education 67 ticularly when men of their detail or uuit are being considered. It requires but little imagination to comprehend what this may mean in the handling of men for whom they are responsible. In other institutions, the practise is being widened to have a selective mem- ber of the custodial staff act as advisor to the inmate in matters which are important to them. This can be productive of excellent results, providing care is taken in the proper selection of these men, for not all prison guards are capable of advising others. In still other institutions the guard and a case worker frequently confer regarding the individual men and their problems. There has been a recommendat.ion that in certain types of institutions the term \"guard\" be abandoned and the title \"counsellor\" be substituted. This is a very healthy move and need not necessarily institute a loosening of the custodial responsibilites. Classification Makes Possible Proper Work an.d Vocational Assionments Assignment to the proper shop, class or other training center is one of the responsibilities of the classification committee. If a man is to go from where he is to where he should be on the basis of his capabilities, interests, physical abilities and all the other factors necessary for consideration in a training program, the correct assignment must be made. If the full effectiveness of the various assignments is to be obtained, this should be done on a very objec- tive basis. Experience has shown that it cannot be done without making a careful study of the shop and the men. As in all life situations, there are qualifications for the various assignments in the institutions just as there are qualifications for the various jobs held by the members of the staff. The job analysis technique is now so well known that there is no need of elaborating it here, but it is e~sily seen that without stating the requirements of the job which should have a training value, it is useless to determine the type of individual who has been recently received in the institution or who is available for assignment. One of the first steps necessary is the analysis of the men who have been scheduled to the various assignments. The minimum and maximum qualifications must be determined, in- cluding physical ability, mental condition, mental level, interests, nttitudes and aptitudes, previous experience, and otlier factors which may be peculiar to the individual job. It would be inad- visable, for example, to assign a man to an advanced course in the school who possesses a low mental level and who had not progresscd any further than the third grade in public school prior to commit- ment. The same holds true as relates to the assignment to the majority of places which have a training value within the institu- tion. When the job analysis has been made, many unrecognized training values will be found in the maintenance assignments. Men properly placed in maintenance assignments, provided they are adequately managed, will derive much benefit. Not only can certain skills be learned, but a slulled mechanic's facility need not deteriorate merely because he is removed from his job. In certain assignments it may be that the important thing may be the con- tact with a certain type of officer who has a very positive effect ' on certain types of individuals. For example, a certain guard may be particularly skillful in stabilizing unstable persons, or he may indeed develop certain new habits which may be of considerably more import,ance to t,he man than the things he will learn to do in the assignment. The well integrated classification system takes this into account. In making assignments for trade training, there must be an effort to suit the assignment to the individual's capabilities, aptitudes and interests. The assignment should be of value either in terms of skills acquired, or habits of industry which are formed., In the intelligently administered institution in which there is concern regarding the educational program, the assigments will be made looking toward employment possibilites at the time of the man's release from the institution. This makes it necessary to know and to know accurately the territory from which the individual was committed and the territory to which he will go following release from the institution. The shop instructor, who is more than likely a specialist in his own field, can be made to feel that he is a part of this entire program, if he is given some responsibility of knowing what the opportunities for employment are in the various ter- ritories served by the i~istitution in the field in which he is par- ticularly interested. \\\\'bile prediction of tlle opportunities for employment at the time of releasr: may be subject to revision, it must be remembered that most of the men received in our prisons and reformatories do not remain in the institution more than three ,years, and during that perjod of time not very ninny wide swings in industry will be made. It is generally true that industries do GS correctional Education Today not shift location to a great extent, but there have been some rather wide move~ncnts of industry during the past few years to the extent that some states no longer provide very much employment along certain lines. For esample, only a few years back one territory was always an outlet for men trained in the weaving shop, but it no longer provides opportunity for employment to men thus trained, for the fabric mills have only recently moved from the north and cast to the south. Such situations occur in all sections of the country to a greater or lesser degree and cannot be ignored in developing the educational program. Classification Makes Possible Assignment to Proper General Education Activities The information supplied by the psychologist and the educational dircctor gives sufficient information so that it is a relatively easy rnntter for the committee to identify those illiterates who are in need of the fundamentals of reading and writing, and perhaps arithmetic. The identification of those who have been deprived of or 1rho have not accepted scholastic training prior to commit~nent but are capable of learning, and who desire it is likewise possible. It docs not require very intensive examinations, but they are more intensive than the identification of those nth0 are in need of train- ing because they are illiterate. The provision of advanced and specialized courses as well as correspondence courses to those whose scholastic background, intelligence and experience indicate that t11is.i~ a need require more specialized study, and, at times, frcquent esa~nination using specialized techniques. Such careful study rannot be ignored if the program is to be economical in time and productive of results. , Cooperation is a Vital Factor in Classification The qucstion ariscs as to who decides as to the actual pro, \"ram of education that shall be followed. Viewing education in its broadest sense :is it has been viewed in this chapter, it is to be seen that one of the advantages of the classificatio~l system is that it prevents a biased point of view. It is true that the custodian \\vi11 tliink in terxns of custody, the physician in terms of Iiealth and physical condition, the psychiatrist in terms of mental health, the psychologist in terms of ability, interests, aptitudes and attitudes, tlic educator in tcrrns of vocational or social education, the director . . Classijication of Inmates for Education 69 of industries in terms of trade jobs. Each of these individusls must 'I be brought together on a common ground and that ground is the classification committee meeting. In this meeting, the emphasis on the individual case will shift. In one case the report of the physi- cian may bear the greatest weight,-for example, he may have identified the person as having a cardiac condition which would immediately close a certain type of activity to him, because it would place too great a strain upon his heart. This might cause a shift in the entire program and rightfully so, for in the ease of such an individual his outlook on life could be entirely changed, provided he could be trained along lines which would enable him to make a legitimate living without calling upon his heart to do a job that it could not do. Classification Gives Purpose and Direction to the Entire Institutional Program One of the almost strange results of classificstiori is the effect it has upon the institution itself. It seems to have the effect of key- ing up the entire personnel to the point where they look upon each prisoner as an individual. Furthermore it has the tendency to enable the institution to break with tradition and to try things out in an experimental way. If education in penal institutions is to make any progress, it must be t,he education of the whole indi- vidual by the whole group. When, through the recognition of individual differences and individual variabilities, the prisoner is given a chance to develop himself, his period of incarceration can become an important period of his life, for it will have given him the opportunity of finding himself. In institutions where classification works effectively, every ac- tivity is considered on the basis of how it helps the prisoner to develop his personality into an integrated whole, so that he can be a community asset. That, after all, is the main job of the prison today. The Gu,idance Program CHAPTER V THE GUIDANCE PROGRAM by Franklin J. Keller . Principal, hletropolitan Vocational High School, New York City John J. Sheehy Vocational Guidance Supervisor, Wallkill Prison, New York State Department of Correction Alfred R. Loos Parole Officer, New York State Division of Parole The purpose of placing delinquents in penal institutions is to adjust to society those who, for various reasons, have become maladjusted. Social adjustment depends upon many factors. In an immediate sense, the economic factor is primary due to the fact that a prisoner is usually not paroled unless he has found a job. Prrmanent adjustment depends upon the extent to which the individual has developed the abilities and attitudes to cope with the situations he meets, including those of holding a job, those of a family nature, the use of leisure-time, establishing satisfactory personal relations, and problems of sickness, unemployment, and the like. In other words, economic and social adjustment, is the rtleasure of the success of the penal institution in reaching its goal. In this scnse, the penal institution provides re-schooling, the object of which is to retrieve the failure of the established school. In recent years it has been realized more and more that this failure 113s been due to the lack of any conscious, certainly of any success- ful, means of preparing young people for vocational competency. One of the striking conclusions of the Regent's Inquiry recently co~iducted in New York State is that, by and large, the secondary schools of the state do not produce young people who are prepared to adjust themselves to their social and economic environment. dl major recommendstion of the Inquiry is that every secondary .school should train for vocational cornpctency, at least to the extent that the school-leaving child may have enough marketable skill to get a start in a job. This does not indicate by any means that ~~roperly organized high schools would obviate the necessity for prisons. There are too many factors involved. But a lack of vocational con~petency, along with a lack of vocational opportunity, docs account to a considerable degree for the seriousness of the delinquency that makes penal institutions necessary. If the indi- vidual is to have a job and thereby to earn the money necessary to buy all the comforts of life, then all the forces of the institution must be brought to bear upon him to the end that he may be ready for that job when the time comes for discharge. In other words, he must be guided, vocationally, educationally, socially, and other- wise. Guidance is fundamental to a prison rehabilitation program. In its basic principles, vocational guidance is no different in prison from mhat it is in a well-organized school. Complex and varied as it is, the general principles and practices are simple. Essentially then they include:' (1) The careful maintenance and continued use of cumulative records, records which give detailed data regarding the school, home, and leisure life of each individual. (2) The administration and interpretation of tests of intelligence, of achievement, of vocational aptitude, ability and interests, of physical characteristics, in fact, of all traits for which valid tests have been devised. (3) The building of individual interviews or conferences for the purpose of discovering these characteristics and eliciting such information as becomes available only through personal give and take of counselor and counselec. (4) The programing of i~ldividuals for varied vocational experi- ences, usually through mhat are known as tryout shops. (5) The presentation through class instruction, through printed matter, and other devices, of occupational information. (6) The finding of jobs when the individual leaves the institution -that is to say, placement. (7) Follow-up of t,hose who Icnve the institution for the purpose of enabling the individual to hold his job, to advance in it, to find jobs for other persons about to leave the institution, and for eval~at~ing and improving the guidance service of the institution. 1. Keller, Franklin J., and Vitelcs, Morris S., Vocational Guidance Through- out the World, New York, W. W. Norton, 1937. ,- 74 Correctional Education Today The Guidance Program 75 this program the reader is referred to the pamphlets on Guidance issued by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Sooner or later as the opportunities arise and the personnel become available, the num- ber of institutions with organized effective guidance programs will increase. One of the advantages enjoyed by Wallkill Prison is the fact that it is a medium security institution. In the Lewisohn Report on Parole and its Principles, it is stated that: \"The prisons and reformatories are an integral and vital part of the parole system. Penal institutions must be schools of industry and training in the responsibility of right living and must prepare their charges for release on parole.\" In conformance with modern penological concepts, the Lewisohn Commission on Prison Construction and Administration decided to build a prison of the medium security type for adult male offenders. A site of 1,000 acres was selected in Ulster County approximately three miles from the Village of Wallkill. When this institution designated as Wallkill Prison was estab- lished in 1932, the policy was adopted of receiving no direct commit- ments from t.he courts but rather to receive from other institutions by transfer, those inmates whose records indicate they are willing and able to profit by the extended opportunities offered for addi- tional vocational training. \"An Institution for Training and Rehabilitation.\" So briefly and so descriptively stated are the main objectives of the institution appearing on a bronze plaque in the entrance corridor. The task of attaining these aims has progressed with each succeeding year, beginning in 1933 with the organization of a vocational training program, under the leadership of a Vocational Director. Religious, recreational and social programs were successiyely introduced, and have become integral parts of the whole training program. All of these agencies have endeavored to develop and maintain a program sufficiently flexible to permit as much diversification as possible within existing limitations. However, early in the history of the institution, it was recognized that to accomplish effectively any permanent and lasting results, it was necessary to visualize the institutional treatment as one phase of a plan which culminated in the release of the inmate under super- vision, where the same program ~vould be continued in the outside community. Such a plan crnbodied participation in the prison pro- gram by the agency responsible for the after-supcrvison of the inmate, i. e., parole. It further required that there should be a /- means for mutual exchange of information; that parole should actively participate in the training program; that there should be some agency within the institution responsible for the coordina- tion of the facilities of the prison and parole, and for correlating the agencies within the prison, in the execution and planning of treatment programs. Fundamentally, the treatment had to be on a case work basis, with voluntary participation by the inmate in the development of a plan, which would be adapted to his needs and calculated to point towards his eventual adjustment in the' community. In July 1936, preliminary plans were discussed for the organiza- tion of an agency within the institution which would meet these specifications. In October 1936, the Commissioner of Correction and the Board of Parole approved the preliminary plans, providing for a vocational guidance supervisor and a parole representative to organize and develop this agency designated as the Service Unit. Considerable thought was devoted to the selection of an appro- priate name for this agency that would designate its functions. It was agreed that technical nanlcs such as 'guidance', 'clinic', 'social work', 'rehabilitation' and the like would defeat the purpose as inmates are prone to shun an agency which infers its title that is engaged in rehabilitative treatment. Mutual Agreement Between the Department of Correction and Parole Since the Department of Correction and the Division of Parole, although treating the same individual, are separate and distinct with different administrative setups, it was necessary to hold numerous conferences including the administrative staff of the institution and the executives of the Division of Parole to deter- mine questions of policy, develop means for coordinating the facilities and resources of their respective departments and to attain a basis for mutual understanding of each other's problcms, limitations, and mode of operation. This was an essential step in order to permit a clear approach to the problem of organization of the Unit, and to have it function efficicntly and effectively. The task of fusing the facilities and resources of both departments in the approach to the common objective seemed at first a most difficult one. However, through the confcrcnce method it was possible to reach a basis of mutual understanding, the principles of which have been embodied in the procedure of the Service Unit. 76 Correctional Education Today Personnel I The Guidance Program 7 7 Thc Service Unit personnel consists of a vocational guidance supervisor, parole representative (on the staff of the Board of Parole) and a social worker. In conforming with the recommenda- tions of the Governor's Commission regarding the training of personnel, high qualification standards have been set for the men selected for this work. All are college graduates who have had both post-graduate training and years of experience in the field of correctional work. In addition to the personnel stated above the Service Unit lltilizes the services of two secretary-stenographers, one furnished by the Division of Parole and one by the Department of Correction. Offices The Service Unit occupies a suite of offices on the first floor of the building. The vocational guidance supervisor, the parole representative and the social worker have individual offices, well suited for the purpose of holding private interviews. The file and conference room connects the o5ces of the parole representative and vocational guidance supervisor. It was recog- nized at the outset, because of the confidential nature of the records and files contained therein that every precaution mould have to be taken to safeguard them. The files are accessible only to the superintendent, assistant superintendent and the members of the Unit. The secretary-stenographers both have private offices set apart for their esclusive use with desks and typewriters for each. In addition to the offices mentioned there is also provided in the Service Unit section an office and mechanical aptitudes testing laboratory that are occupied by the foreman of industries. This staff member is perfecting 3, battery of mechanical aptitude tests particularly designed to be of material assistance to the vocational guidance program. Thc Staff library is a part of the large office occupied by the head teacher. It is available to all employees, contains all types of books, periodicals, etc. having to do with such technical subjects as criminology, penology, education, psychiatry, psychology, social work, vocational information, reports of social conferences, corn- mittees. et~. Equipment All offices are equipped with ample furniture, supplies, ete. including desks, chairs, tables, typewriters, bookcases and filing cabinets. A dictaphone is available. Stenographic Service The stenographic work of the Service Unit is equally divided, in so far as possible between the two secretary-stenographers. The institution secretary-stenographer is required to do all of the steno- graphic work that arises out of the operation of the Service Unit activities. The Parole secretary-stenographer is responsible for routine parole work. However, in the further solution of routine stenographic work, it has been found satisfactory to have an arrangement whereby each will assist the other when time and work permit; and at the same time duplication is minimized. Duties and Responsibilites of the Members of the Service Unit The next objective in the organization plan was an agreement between the vocational guidance supervisor and the parole rep- resentative as to the respective duties and responsibilites and the types of problems to be handled by each, together with an under- standing of the functions of their subordinates. It was decided that all contacts relative to inmate assignments, vocational guid- ance, and inmate problems connected with institutional routine would be referred to the vocational guidance supervisor, assisted by the social worker. The parole representative would deal with inmate problems pcrtaining to community contacts such as prob- lems of relief for families, marital problems, special investigations, and the like, in addition to all matters pertaining directly to parole. However, this arrangement is a flesible one, and frequently both members confer with an inmate, because of the inter-relationship of many inmate problems with both institutional and pnrolc proccdurc. It is felt that such a procedure also tends to make known the fact that the Service Unit functions as a unified organization, although represcnting different departments. 78 Correctional Education Today Guidance Enters the Program The administration of a guidance program in a penal institution is affected in no small measure by any and all institutional activi- ties, including the methods followed in granting correspondence and visiting privileges, the type of supervision given on work details, the method of enrolling in school, the program of instruction followed in shops and classes, the availability of recreational facilities, and a host of other problems of comparable inportance. If any or all of these activities are limited or in need of reorganiza- tion, it most certainly is the concern of the guidance personnel. Since guidance deals with the whole person and his adjustment, the effects or influences tending to hinder the individual or his adjustment should be modified so that the eventual benefit will accrue not only to the individual inmate and the guidance program but to the institution and its entire program. The presumption before the initiation of a guidance program is that opportunities are available for guidance purposes. Limited facilities occasioned by unorganized or partially organized courses of study, inadequately trained personnel, a narrow or confined cur- riculun~ nith the accompanying lack of diversified types of training, the delegation of training to the background in favor of the exploita- tion of inmate labor, and the like, are handicaps that deter the proper functioning of the institutional program in general and the guidance program in particular. In the initial stages of its organization, the Unit found itself faced with the problem of developing a satisfactory system for obtaining a11 pertinent information regarding the institutional adjustment of an inmate, so that it might be recorded in a central file for the pur- pose of treatment. While it was found that the prison does have a case foldrr on each and every inmate, containing copies of the pro- bation report, medical, psychological, and psychiatric examinations, visiting and correspondence lists, bad conduct reports, and corre- spondence, there was no record of the progress and adjustment of The Guidance Program 79 made known to the other. As a consequence, any plan of treatment if such were formulated, was of necessity a haphazard one, with little recognition given to the total needs of the inmate. The inmate population itself was aware of the lack of unity and cohesion in the institution and it was a common occurrence to have an inmate approach four or five of the staff members with the same request, and have each one working on it without the knowledge of the other. On the other hand, it often happened that an inmate himself was at a loss as to what staff member to interview regarding a problem that may have developed in his case; e. g., the question of securing relief for his family, that of securing permission for certain types of correspondence, that of obtaining information about his eligible date of release and what steps to take if there had been an error in the computation thereof, the manner in which he might obtain additional jail time to which he was entitled. Repeatedly, problems existed in an inmate's case, but little was ever done about them until they affected institutional routine or caused a disciplinary reaction. Furthermore, no effort had been made to record in a central file impressions, attitudes, observations and such problems as may have occurred during the period of an inmate's confinement. In the institution, moreover, the Division of Parole, maintained a case folder with copies of parole reports, social and personal histories, all valuable in any plan of treatment, but this information was not furnished to the institution unless specifically requested. These are a few illustrations of the confusion that existed at the time the Unit was organized. In brief, the Unit faced the problem of organizing a guidance program. In the initial steps it was recognized that staff particpa- tion was essential to its success, since the progress of any plan of coordination is proportionate to the degree of cooperation obtained. Further, to achieve coherence and unity in the program the facilities of the institution and parole had to be more closely integrated. the inmate to the institutional program. Scattered throughout the Coordination of the Facilities of institution in as many departments as existed, there were some data the Institution and Parole on each case, but only such as wcre needed for the respective depart- An arrangement was effected, whereby the information obtained ments. No efforts had been made to correlate these in a central file, by both departments in their case contacts becomes mutually avnil- so that there ~vould be readily available a clear and complete picture of thc institutional adjustment. Each department functioned sep- able. By maintaining a common folder in the Unit and recording therein this informat.ion, it is now possible to obtain n clear and nrately and distinctly and the accomplishments of one were not complete picture of an inmate's institutiollal adjustment, the plan SO Correctional Education Today The Guidance Program 8 1 of treatment followed, together with an evaluation of this plan. Parolc had undertaken the responsibility of furnishing a complete and thorough social history of each case, of making an investigation of family and social problems during the period of confineAent, of furnishing records of the adjustment of inmates after their release on psrole, and through the Parole Representative in the institution, actively participating in the planning of an institutional program of treatment. The prison, on the other hand, is now in a position whereby it is in possession of complete information about an in- mate's social and family history, and can plan his program intelli- gently without depending upon unverified statements. It is now assured of an agency to which it can refer social and other problems requiring investigation, and have confidence that they will be properly handled and that a report will be forthcoming. The institution, too, by its present system of records, is now in a position to present to the Board of Parole its recommendations which are based not on the institutional adjustment alone, but on a carefull study of all the factors in a given case. Service Unit Procedures Initial Interview upon Reception by Transfer 1. Vocational Guidance Supervisor Immediately upon reception an interview that serves as an intro- duction to the institution is held with the inmate. The inmate is advised of the aims and objectives of the institution, what is expected of him, what the institution in general, and more particu- larly what the Service Unit can do to assist in his adjustment here. Efforts are made to ascertain his occupational interests and experiences with a view not only to make tentative plans for temporary assignments but also to arouse or enliven an interest in the adoption of a training program. He is also requested to submit the name and address of his nearest relative, if he so desires, so t,hat a lctter of introduction containing rules and regulations of the institution as well as the reason for his transfer to an institution of this type can be forwarded. During the introductory interview the inmate is advised of the reception procedure which includes interviews with the assistant superintendent, vocntional director, recreational director, physician, correspondcncc censor, parole rcprcscntative and the chaplain rep- resenting his religious affiliation. 1 Since assignments to work details are of major concern to the inmate because of the important role they play in his daily existence and routine, they are discussed with him. Assignments, too, are an important phase of the guidance program as they furnish the means to evalultte attitude, industry and performance. ' A form has been developed which is filled out by the inmate requesting a change of assignment. The Unit, through the voca- tional guidance supervisor, receives all applications for changesof assignment, evaluates them, and submits its recommendations to the Classification Committee, which also functions as the Assign- ment Board. He also is advised that subsequent interviews may be held per- taining to his institutional program. Interviews serve as a medium for establishing the counselor-client relationship and for giving guidance and assistance wherever possible. It has been the experience with a new transferee that if some member of the staff is willing to answer his numerous and varied inquiries, the inmate is more apt to be cooperative and willing to assume his share of the responsibility that may be placed upon him at this institution. 2. Assistant Superintendent The inmate is informed of the rules governing inmates, work hours, type of discipline, and all other matters affecting his adjust- ment. 3. Vocational Director The purpose of this interview is to inform the inmate of the training opportunities provided for him, and efforts are made to enlist his interest and cooperation in a tentative trnining program. 4. Recreational Director The inmate is advised of the recreational opportunities in the institution and the possiblities of his participation in it. 5. Physician The primary purpose of this interview is for s complete medical examination. Plans are made for nny remedial treatment which may be indicated by the results of the examinat,ion. 6. Correspondence Censor Tlie inmate participates in the preparation of his correspondence and visiting list in accordance with prescribed regulations. 8 2 Correctional Education Today The Guidance Program 83 7. Parole Representative This intervicnl is held within one n-eek after an inmate is received on transfer. It enables the parole representative to review the parole questionnaire with each inmate and make any necessary correctjons and additions. At the same time the parole representa- tive is on the alert for any social and family problems that may csist, and offers the inmate assistance in the solution of these prob- lems. The tentative parole program is discussed, and where it is indicated that the one proposed by the inmate would not be acceptable to the Board of Parole, the inmate is informed of this fact so that his efforts may be directed towards the preparation of a suitable program. In this interview attention is centered on the cstahlishment of a friendly relationship with the inmate for the purpose of having llim come to recognize that the parole rep- resentative is interested in his welfare and desirous of rendering him assistance in the adjustment of any social problems that con- front him at this time or that may develop during the period of his confinement at l17:~lllcill. Any existing social and family problems are referrqd to the field staff of the Division of Parole for investigation and fol1ou~-up and the inmate is kept informed of the progress made in their solution. Attention is also focused on the elimination, in so far as possible, of those factors which might cause an inmate to be set back by the Board of Parole-such factors as evasiveness, misrepresentation, and untruthfulness. Each inmate is furnished with a copy of the ~,arole pamphlet \"Rules of the Board of Parole and Laws Relating to Parole\" and encouraged to consult the parole representative regarding any information desired on the subject. The parole reprcscntativc also has available a number of pamphlets on vene- renl diseases and thcse are distributed to each inmate suffering from :my such affliction, in order to acquaint him with the nature of tliesc diseases and educate him to the recognition of the need of c.ontinued treatment both n-ithin the institution and on parole. In those cases \\\\,here an inmate's family is receiving public :1ssistancc, a notice is sent to the social agency supcrvisirlg the ('L~sc, informing tllem of tile inmate's transfer and date of eligibility for rclcasc, together with other pertinent information. 8. Chaplains The inmate is intervic~ved by the mcmber of the clergy reprcsent- ir~g his particular faith. Efforts are made to continue or enliven ])is iiltcrcst in religious activities. Recording of Interviews Reports are made to the Service Unit on all initial interviews conducted. An interview rating scale has been devised particularly suited to this situation. A brief summary is made of all interview scales submitted and is incorporated as part of the case record. Preparation of Material jor Preclassijication Investigation Within one week aftjer inmate's transfer, the required material is prepared for an investigation by the Division of Parole, termed a Pre-Classification investigation. This material consists of the chronological case histories prepared by the Service Unit in addi- tion to the probation reports, medical and blotter records. The completed investigation is submitted to the institution within seven weeks. Procedure in Classi$cation Investigation In this investigation the legal, social, family and personal history of the inmate, special emphasis is placcd upon the follon-ing: 1. Education Records As complete a record as possible of an inmate's educational back- ground is obtained and verified, thus correcting one of the former major institutional weaknesses in the guidance program. The Unit assumes the responsibility of furnishing this information to the educational director for use in this program. In addition, the vocational guidance supervisor utilizes the record in planning the training programs. 2. Occupational History An accurate and thorough history of an inmate's industrial record is procured, so that the data arc available to the Unit in planning a program of training in conjunction with the inmate and to permit the classification committee to evaluntc thc assignments recom- mended bcforc taking final action. This proccdt~rc eliminates a further ~veakncss since it obviates the necessity for accepting un- verified statements made by the inmate for the purpose of securing a dcsircd assignment. 3. Lcgal History Tliis phase of the Pre-Classific&ion Report plays an important part in thc prison guidance program. It is csscntial to obtain a cornplcte history of the crime and the crinli~lnl record of an innlate S4 Correctional Education Today The Guidance Program 85 in order to plan intelligently a program of training and equip him with vocational skills in that tradc or occupation from which he will not bc barred upon his release. 4. Fanlily Situation Information is obtained on the family relationships and the family attitude toward the inmate for the purpose of utilizing as Inany coristructivc factors and influences as possible in planning the community program, and in order to secure the cooperation of the family in the plan of treatment. 5. Community Situation The conlmunity attitude merits investigation in as much as this information may decidedly effect an inmate's parole program, par- ticularly when the attitude is an unfriendly one. In the latter cascs, steps are taken to prepare a program in another and different community. Interviewing the complainant in some types of cases such as rape, assault, etc., is sometimes productive of valuable inform:ltion in as much as it is occasionally found that an entirely diffcrcnt version may be otained of the degree of guilt and the extent of an inmate's participation, either in a mitigating or aggra- vating sense. Under this heading should also be included data about the work opportunities in the community which may be available to the inmate. It is especially helpful if the investigating parole officer, because of his familiarity with the area in which he works, suggests some of the work opportunities that may exist in that area and for which possibly the inmate could be trained during his prison residence. To be more specific, in some areas presumably the only effective work outlet or job market is that of farmhand. It is a waste of energy to train a man as a machinist, if, because of family ~ituation and other factors, there is no community market for this type of training. A brief industrial survey by the investigating j)arole officcr might very n~ll read as follows: The town of-to which the innlate will presumably return, has a population of 22,000 persons. Although the chief industry in the city is wooden furniture mnnufacturc, there are in addition three or four active job printing establishments, one iron foundry, thrcc or four fairly active job rnachine shops, probably not less than two dozen garages and service stations, and the usual mercantile estab- lishments to be found in a city of this size. I have learned from the Chamber of Commerce that although the furniture factories have only been working part timc, anticipated business would in the majority of them rcsult in full time operation within the next year. I have further learned from the Chamber of Commerce that build- ing construction in this community which has been at low ebb for the last seven years, has sho~vn a marked increase during the last six months with the possibility of a definite increase in the field of private home construction which is much needed in this area. The foregoing gives some idea of the employment opportunities that might be available to the inmate if he desired training in some of the major occupational fields. The information about an inmate's expressed training interests is generally contained in the Initial Interviews which are available to the investigating parole officer at the time of the pre-classification investigation. In those cascs where an inmate makes a selection of a training program after the receipt of the pre-classification report, one procedure is to request the parole officer in the inmate's com- munity to determine the work opportunities for the type of training selected. In this manner, the investigating parole officer also par- ticipates in the planning of the inmate's program. Tentative Parole Program In so far as possible the tentative parole program is obtained from the inmate so that it can be investigated during the course of the pre-classification investigation. Efforts are also made to obtain some information regarding possible \"leads\" for employ- ment upon his release. If this information is checked during the course of the investi- gation, reliable data are obtained upon which to plan a program of training. For example, if an inmate requests enrollment in the auto shop, claiming that his uncle or somc other relative is the owner of a garage and will provide him with employment as a mechanic's helper, this is investigated in order to determine whether the opportunity will be available or whether the inmate is merely making the claim in order to be enrolled. The training planned for the inmate should be closely related to the probable opportunity for employment. 86 Correctional Education Today The Guidance Program 87 Plans Followed in the Institution During Period of Pre-Classification Investigation Assignment to General Labor and Maintenance Upon his reception, every inmate is assigned to some type of general labor or maintenance work. Wherever possible, he is allowed to select the general type of work he prefers within the fields of maintenance or general labor, consideration being given to his physical condition, his previous work experiences and the type of program that may be formulated with him. It has been found that, during this investigation period, the inmate is in need of considerable assistance and guidance, particularly with reference to the interpretation of the system of work assignments peculiar to this institution, the necessity for his participation, the type of supervision and other matters of institutional routine incidental to his adjustment here. Further, frequent interviews are held with the inmate during this period in an attempt to ascertain his occu- pational interests and the extent to which he believes that a training program may be of benefit to him. Exploratory work and school csperiences arc made available to the inmate in order to enable both him and the classification committee to make some tentative plans. The inmate supervisors and instructors are required to submit rating scale reports ora his performance, general attitude, interests, etc. Follow-up by the Service Unit The vocational guidance supervisor in cooperation with the members of the institutional staff secures all the information possible on the particular inmate through the mediums of reports, anecdotes and observations, together with verbal reports that may be rendered by any or all employees coming into contact with the inmate. If indicnted, minor tentative adjustments are made (sither by interpreting institutional routine and policy or by modi- fying some existing tentative program. Itcports Submitled 20 the Service Unit 1. Educational Rcports Alonthly reports are submitted by the vocational director which contain a list of all ncw school enrollees, as well ns a list of those students dropped together with explanations for such action. This material is then entered in the case folders so that at all times the records are maintained on a current, chronological cumulative basis and thereby furnish p rather complete picture of an inmate's adjustment to a program. 2. Proceedings of the Court (Discipline) The Principal Keeper's Court reviews all cases which warrant Bad Conduct Reports as a form of disciplinary action. Entries are made covering the type of offense, as well as the action taken in each case. This particular phase of an inmate's institutional adjustment is a very important one in that it often makes a very significant contribution to the complete picture of institutional adjustment as well as an insight into the character and general makeup of the individual. 3. Correspondence and Visiting Lists Copies of the inmate's correspondence and visiting lists are furnished to the Service Unit shortly after his reception. Any subsequent changes are also reported. The benefits of such an arrangement accrue to the correspondence censor and the officer in charge of visits, as well as to the Unit. 4. Progress Reports A simple, concise and readily understandable rating scale has been devised for reporting to the Unit the progress of an inmate in his work assignment, his vocational and educational tmining program, his leisure time or recreational program as well as the many other phases of institutional life which may be of importarice in gauging the extent of adjustment of the innlate to his particular program. These reports are submitted at stated intervals by all members of the employees' group coming in direct contact with the inmate. This material, plus a11 other anecdotes, observations and verbal reports becomes 3, part of the case foldcr. This particular type of report, because of its significance and peculiarity to a prison program, will be explained more fully under \"Plan of Treat~nent Follow-up.\" Testing Programs In the majority of cases transferred to this institution it has bcen found that the classification clinics of thc reception prisons are furnishing results of their psychologicnl arid psychiatric studies. However, nrhcn one considers the ideal eituat,ion there is considcr- SS Correctional Education Today The Guidance Program 89 able room for improvement toward the development of aptitude, ability and achievement tests sufficiently standardized and pmc- tical so that the results may be properly interpreted and utilized in the formulation of training and treatment programs. Preparation and Presentation of Case to the Classification Committee Upon the receipt of the pre-classification report submitted by t,he Division of Parole, the Service Unit attempts to formulate a tentative training program based on the interests of the inmate, the findings and recommendations within the institution and the pre-classification investigation. The digest of the case plus the recommendations for a tentative program are incorporated into a report which is presented to the Classification Committee. The Classification Committee, composed of the assistant superintendent, vocational director, recreational director, physician, guidance supervisor, the parole representative and the superintendent as an ex-officio member, meets each week to revierv the cases as presented and, after deliberation, recommends the adoption of the plan best suited to the needs and interests of the inmate. The Classification Committee Report, with the adopted plan of t,reatment is then incorporated into the case record. Execution of the Adopted Plan of Treatment The Service Unit, in cooperation with the Classification Com- mittee, is charged with the responsibility of putting the adopted plan into operation. The vocational guidance supervisor inaugurates the vocational and educational phases of the plan through placement in the recom- mended assignments and through enrollment in'the school program. I-Ic also refers the recreational, religious and medical treatment plan to the respective staff members. The parole representative initiates the program for the treatment of such personal, marital, and family problems as require the co- operation of outside agencies for thier adjustment. Follow-up of Plan Progress Reports This type of report was developed by the Unit to meet a definite need for some practical means of checking an inmate's progress and ~idjustment to the program outlined, and to furnish the employee group responsible for submitting these reports with a simple and concise method of recording their observations, impressions and judgments of the inmate. It is actually a rating scale covering an inmate's performance, judgment, cooperation and general make- up, with provisions for additional comment or other characteriza- tion not included in the general headings. It is a composite report, with additions and alterations to meet the prison situation, of the type used by various business and industrial organizations. Interviews and Conferences Frequently, interviews are held by the personnel of the Service Unit with the inmate alone, the supervisor alone, and also jointly with the inmate and his supervisor, to discuss the adjustment and the progress of the inmate. Because of the inherent nature of the medical and religious phases of the treatment plan, they are not incorporated in the prescribed progress report, but the Unit receives either verbal or written reports. Review by the Classification Committee The Service Unit reports to the Classification Committee those cases in which an inmate has not adjusted himself to the training program or those in which other causes indicate that some modi- fication of the plan should be made. It often happens that a super- visor reports an inmate for poor performance or laclcing in ability, aptitude and interest. On the other hand, an inmate may esperi- ence a change of interest, may be dissatisfied ~ith his assignment, or undergo a personality conflict either with his supervisor or his fellow inmates. The vocational guidance supervisor attempts to adjust as many of these problems as possible before submitting the case to the Classification Committee for review and modification. Those cases in which a successful adjustment to a training program is effect.ed, are reviewed by the Committee at intervals. Cumulative Case Records -4 case folder, legal size, is maintained for each inmate. All entries, contacts, interviews, changes of assignment, etc., are recorded in chronological order. Undcr this system of recording, it is possible to follow an inmate's adjustment and progress from the date of his transfer to this inst,i- tution to the date of his release. 90 Correctional Education Today The Guidance Program 91 The case folder is set up on the following basis- 1. Left side of folder a. Face sheet b. Photograph c. Pre-classification report d. Medical record c. Chronological sheets in consecutive order f. Preparole report 2. Right side of folder a. Correspondence in chronological order. b. Progress sheets in same order. c. Current chronological sheet. Types of Interviews-Problems Referred Initial This interview is held by the Staff and Unit members within one week of the inmate's transfer. Assignment When an inmate files an application for an assignment or change of assignment, the vocational guidance supervisor discusses the application with him, his reason for making request, and his insti- tubional adjustment. The interview, held on an informal basis, often offers an opportunity for assisting the inmate to adjust to his present assignment, his supervisor, and fellow ,workers. Training Program After the inmate has had an opportunity to observe the various types of training offered at the institution, the vocational guidance supervisor interviews him to ascertain further his interests in a training program. Available occupational material is furnished the inmate to assist him in his selection. Information obtained in pre- vious interviews and from reports of his supervisors may act as a guide to the interviewer in directing the inmate to a choice of pro- gram. From this xnay follow enrollment in an exploratory course where his progress and adjustment is carefully noted pending pcrmancnt enrollment in a training program. Preparole This is conducted by the parole representative at least four months in advance of the inmate's eligibility to appear before the Board of Parole. The inmate's parole program, consisting of suit- able residence and employment, is obtained so that it may be forwarded for investigation in time for his appearance. Parole Inquiry This is occasioned by the request of an inmate for information on parole, its operations, its laws, its general rules and conditions, his date of eligibility, advice on suitability of parole programs, clarification of misconceptions, and the like. The parole representa- tive has available various pamphlets covering parole la.rvs, rules and conditions, copies of which are furnished to each inmate. Family Problems ' These refer to problems existent in inmates' families such as relief, care and welfare of children, location of members of the family, lack of visits and correspondence, health of family mem- bers, etc. Personal Problems These pertain to various types of problems presented by inmates that refer more to themselves as individuals than as members of a family group; i. e., insurance, protection, expenditure of compensa- tion and cash, misunderstandings between the inmate and super- visors or with fellow inmates, requests to write letters, obtain records, etc. AIarital Problems These refer to interviews relative to difficulties or problems arising out of the marital rclationship; e. g., misunderst.andings, separations, divorce, infidelity, conflicts bctnfeen inmates and n-ives, reconciliation, common law unions. Lcgal Problems Thcse pertain to illegal sentcnccs, jail time, various sections of the Penal Law, Code of Criminal Procedure, Parole and Correction Laws. 92 Correctional Education Today The Guidance Program Collateral These are held with individuals other than inmates; e. g., mem- bers of the staff, members of the families, prospective empioyers, social workers, etc. Parole Employment These are held with the inmate after his preparole interview, and relate to jobs submitted by him for his parole program; also inquiries as to the type of jobs acceptable to the Board of Parole. Release This is the final interview with the inmate, and is held on the day preceding his release, at which time he signs his parole agree- ment and receives final instructions as to the time and place of his Arrival Report. Executive Clemency These are held with those inmates who desire to file or have filed an application for executive clemency.

Case Work with Inmates and Their Families During the period of the inmate's confinement there are various types of problems that develop not only in his own case but also in his family. The Unit recognizes that in order to carry on an effective guidance program it must treat not only the inmate's problems, but also those that may exist or develop in his family, and attempt to adjust them during his confinement. Emphasis is placed on efforts to keep the inmate's family united, to have him maintain contact with it, and to strengthen familial and marital relationships in anticipation of his return to the community. In the interest of both the community and the individual the stability and influences of these relationships should be fostered and pre- served as much as possible. Follow-up Program Through Cooperation with the Division of Parole The Unit receives copies of the parole supervision records of former inmates. Copies of Violation of Pnrole reports are also sul)mitted. Under this armngcmcnt, the Unit is able to fol10~ the ~tdjustmcnt of inmates fro111 the day of their rcleasc to tlle expiration of their masimum sentence. 04 Correctional Education Today The Guidance Program 95 The Unit recognizes that in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the institutional program of training, a study should be made of the adjustment of those paroled imnates who have received the benefit of this program. Case Studies This section includes two case studies of inmates who have passed through the Service Unit. The inmate's background, institutional history, program of treatment, and post-institutional adjustnlent are described in detail. Success is not al~vays assured. The field is new and there are inevitably many unknown factors entering into the picture. The first cnse has been deliberately selected because it was an out- standing failure. Apparently every technique known was applied to this case and yet the inmate failed to withstand the pressures of society. The second case mas an outstanding success. The outcome indicates that a well organized correctional program can be highly successlul. The two extremes indicate that we still have much to learn. CASE I Introduction Daniel M-, a white male, 34 years of age, married and the father of two children, serving a sentence of seven and one-half to fifteen years for robbery, Social Background Daniel, a product of the lower East Side in New York City, was the fifth in a fraternity of twelve children, seven of whom are living, of foreign born, hard working, law-abiding parents. How- ever the control, supervision and guidance of their children were conditioned by the conflicts arising from their inability to adapt themselves to the customs of this country. His early life was uneventful, and Daniel attained the Sth grade in public school, leaving at the age of 15 years to go to work to augment the family income which at the time was insufficient to maintain the home. At the ngc of 16 years, he secured employment as a presser, at a salary of $25 a week, gradually acquiring sufficient skill to become an operator. His wages steadily increased until he attained an average of $45 weekly. As far as can be determined, Daniel did not come into conflict with the law prior to his prcsent conviction, although two of his younger brothers served prison terms. 7 / + *! /\" At the age of 20 years Daniel married a 17 year old girl, event,u- ally established his own home, became a devoted husband and apparently a considerate father. He worked steadily, supported his home adequately, and was living what might be. termed a comfortable existence, when his employment terminated. At the time, his wife was pregnant, expecting to be confined with her second child. There is no indication that the inmate applied to any social agencies for assistance. Crime and Incarceration While his wife was confined in the hospital, Daniel participated in an armed payroll robbery, mas apprehended practically on the scene of the crime and was subsequently convicted and sentenced to a term of seven and one-half to fifteen years. Early in 1932, he was admitted to Sing Sing, where he received the customary esaminations by the psychiatrists, psychologist, physician, school authorities, chaplain and parole officer. Shortly before Christmas, because of overcronlded conditions, he was trans- ferred to an upstate maximum security prison, which is a consider- able distance from New York City. While at Sing Sing, he was able to receive semi-monthly visits from his wife, but the distance and expense involved in traveling to the upstate prison, acted to make these visits more and more infrequent; in addition, his family was now the recipient of public assistance. Daniel remained at the upstate prison for a period of 20 months, first performing on a routine assignment of yard labor and then being transferred to the maintenance tailor shop, to do routine work. His adjustment was average, ,but this distance from his family and infrequent visits caused him to become depressed. Transjer to lVallkill Prison In the latter part of 1034 he was granted a transfer to the Medium Security Prison at IVnllliill, 1'. Y.,approsimately SO miles from New York City. At this time lie had approsinlately 3 years to serve before being eligible to appear before the Parole Board. Shortly after his arrival he n.as interviewed by members of the institutional staff relative to a self-bcttern~cnt program. At fisrt he believed that work \\~itll an outside constri~ction group would afford him an opportunity to secure sonle fresh air and wholesome esercise. In a short time he requested enrollment in a training program in the tailor shop. /7 The Guidance Program 97 96 Correctional Education Today In addition to his training program in the tailor shop, Daniel was enrolled in related courses of nlathematics and English. His participation in the various recreational activities of an intra- mural type (including baseball, volley ball, basketball as well as games of the sedentary type) enabled him to use his leisure time to constructive advantage. A program of religious instruction was formulated by the Chaplain, and the inmate became a regular attendant at religious services. In brief, the institution, with the cooperation of the inmate, was able to organize a well-rounded program of treatment. Being nearer his home, visits from his family became more frequent. During these visits he learned that his family was in need of medical care and treatment not included in their Welfare allon~ance. Daniel then, because of the opportunity for training afforded him, presented his problem to the Service Unit, and asked its assistance in remedying the situation. Through the efforts of the Service Unit, the Division of Parole arranged with the various ~0~i31 agencies for a program of medical care and an increased allo~r-ance. Daniel, now assured that his family was receiving adequate care, and that there was an agency in the institution to assist him in the solution of his problems, endeavored to persevere in securing further knowledge and skills that would equip him as a tradesman. The ensuing time passed uneventfully until his scheduled appearance before the Board of Parole at which time he received favorable consideration. History of Parole Supervision After serving approximately five and one-half years on his mini- mull scntence of sevcn and one-half years, inmate was released on parole to rejoin his wife and family and to accept employment as a tailor. Daniel xorked quite steadily at his trade for about six months, earning an avcrage of $20-$25 weekly, when he was laid off due to depressed business conditions. For a period of two months it was necessary to obtain relief from the Welfare Depart- ment after xi~hich he again was employed part time, averaging $15-$20 a week. During this interval, Daniel was admitted to the Clothing M70rlicrs' Union. I-Iis home life was harmonious and the former congenial relations with his wife and children were rcne~ved. Throughout the period of parole supervision, thcrc is evidence that the family income was insufficient for their needs, and subject frequently complained of the difficulties of keeping within the limits of his salary. Daniel was apparently living up to the rules and conditions of Parole, when we find that he is arrested, along with two others, for par- ticipating in a serious crime. Thus we have the situation of an individual, subjected to the constructive influences of the institution in the vocational, social, and spiritual fields, finally qualified as a tradesman and released to employment in line with his institutional vocational training. Upon release, he leads an apparently normal, law-abiding existence, for a brief period and then when subjected to economic pressure reverts to his former criminal pattern by participating in another serious crime. Despite the constructive measures taken by the institution, Daniel nTas a failure in his community adjustment. Wherein lies the fault? CASE I1 Introduction John A-, a white male, 32 years of age, serving a term of four to eight years for the crime of rape. Social Background John, the thirteenth child in a fraternity of fourteen children, the son of an itinerant farm laborer, was reared in a rural area among surroundings characterized by alcoholism and economic insecurity. His education was obtained in several district scliools, and was limited to the fourth grade level, which he attained at the age of 14 years. He left school to go to work to supplemcnt the family income. . His work experiences were chiefly as a farm hand and laborer, but the seasonal nature of this work and a native nomadic instinct prevented him from settling in one locality. At the age of 19 yenrs, John n7ns married to a 16 year old girl but this union was not compatible and finally ended in divorce. Severnl years Iatcr, lie married a widow, niother of one child- the girl involvcd in the inmate's crime. Due to the lack of pcr- msnent employn~ent'this family group was forced to seek aid from the Welfare Dcpartrnent. 95 Correctional Education ~oda~ The Guidance Progranz 09 Crime and Incarceration During the period of unemployment, the inmate became intimate with his step-daugl1ter;age 13 years, who later became pregnant. His arrest and conviction followed. The first nine months of his term was spent in a maximum security prison where he was subjected to the various policies, methods and influences common to an institution of this type. There he faced the problem of adjusting himself to the routine of prison life and the association of those presumably well versed in the ways and methods common to institutional existence. Shortly thereafter, John was advised that he was selected by the Classification Clinic as a possible transferee to the medium security prison in southern New York State. At first, John experienced con- siderable unrest because he was uninformed on this institution and particularly as it was so far away from his home. Transfer to Wallkill Prison However, his fears were short-lived because upon reception at this new institution he immediately noticed the decided contrast to that of the maximum security prison he had just left: No walls, no armed guards, a decided lack of tension among the inmate population, and a nholesome spirit expressed by the members of the personnel. Upon being interviewed by the various members of the staff, John asked that he be given the opportunity to enroll in plumbing inasmuch as previous work experiences indicated to him that knowledge of the fundamentals and skills of this trade mould be of material assistance to him upon release. The Classification Committee approved a training program of plumbing and relnted courses. Reports submitted by the various supervisors and instructors showed the inmate to be a willing, industrious student. The instructors in architectural drawing, blue print rending, estimating, english and mathematics described him as being attentive, persevering and progressive despite the psycho- logical classificntion of M. A.-12 years and an I. Q. of 80. About six months after his reception, John became ill and was confined to the institutional hospital. During his confinement he received a letter from his ~ife saying that she 11ad definitely decided to sevcr thcir marital relationship and did not care to hear from him in the future. This combination of circumstances placed the inmate in a despondent frame of mind, from which it was difficult to arouse him. Responding to both medical and casework treatment he gradually regained his health and attacked the problem of so occupying himself as to prove to the world that he was not deflated in spite of the reverses suffered. At his initial appearance before the Board of Parole, because of a legal technicality, his release was deferred. At this time he had acquired sufficient skills and knowledge to equip him as a plumber's helper, and with the existing limitations of practical experience, further assignment to plumbing would be of a more or less repetitive, routine detail. This problem was dis- cussed with the inmate by the guidance supervisor with the result that another program was presented to the Classification Commit- tee recommending enrollment in the welding shop for the purpose of acquiring this knowledge as further related to the plumbing trade. The new program was approved and the assignment effected. In this new assignment John continued his sincere and wholehearted application to his trade training program. He remained the atten- tive and progressive student and was again characterized by his instructors as being one of the best men in the shop. Maintenance work of the institution, in plumbing and welding, gave him a reason- able amount of practical experience. Subsequently John's case was again brought to the attention of the Board of Parole for reconsideration based on his excellent institutional adjustment, his n.holesome attitude, and the degree of stability that he demonstrated. Having received favorable consideration at this re-appearance, the Service Unit was able to secure a position for him as a welder's apprentice with a large manufacturing firm in upper New York State. His salary was to be fifty cents an hour with increases dependent upon his ability and performance. In September 1937, the inmate walked out of Wallkill Prsion, a free man, to start life anew. History of Parole Supervision John worked for a period of six months as a welder with this conccm. Because of his slcilled ~vorkmanship he received several increases and his average salary was $40 to $50 weekly. Due to a slacli business period he was unemployed for some weeks. He later received a job as a welder on a bridge construc- tion project at the journe~nlan salary of $1.37 an hour. :It the completion of this job he obtained work on the same project as a 100 Correctional Education Today The Guidance Program 101 painter. Althogether, this employment lasted approximately three months. During his period of unemployment he supported him- self from his savirlgs account, begun shortly after his release. John requested the assistance of his parole officer in the solution of his marital situation hoping eventually to effect a reconciliation. His efforts werc ur~successful because of his wife's determined refusal to return to him. Accepting the situation, he is now assisting her in sc~curing 3 divorce. During this time, even while unemployed, lle rcgulnrly contributed toward the support of his family, although separated from them. Because of a business upswing his first employer has rehired him and again he is earning a good salary at his trade of welding. Frequent letters have been received from the inmate advising his former counselors of his well being. Appreciation and gratitude :ire esenlplified in these communications. Guidance in Other New York State Correctional Institutions Guidance is a part of the program of all New York State Correc- tional Inst,itutions. The brief summaries given below illustrate certain variations :lnd additional features of the guidance program which have proved effective in varying situtations. ELMIRA REFORMATORY The new inmate upon admission to the Reformatory is placed in the Receiving Clinic where he is kept for thirty days. Here a thorough analysis and study is made of the individual to ascertain his interests, needs, capacities, limitations and potentialities. Lectures, interl;icu-s, study periods and tolirs of the various shops and school rooms of the institution designed to start the youth off in step are also a part of the Clinic program. At the completion of the inmate's stay in this Clinic he is brought before the classification board, which consists of the following members of the Kcformatory personnel: superintendent, assistant superintendent, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician, disciplinarian, clmplains (Catholic, Protestant and Ilebrew), and a reprcscntative of the Parole Board. The classification board considers each boy's case in detail and outlines an individual program of treatme~lt for Ilim. IIe is then placed in regular institution groups, or in one of the Special Training units, or in thc hospital, psychopathic clinic or special guidance school. WESTFIELD STATE FARM The Quarantine Period After the establishment of the residence in the hospital for 3 period of quarantine, the newly arrived inmate receives the benefits of a thorough study of her case by the various agencies available for the purpose. 1. Testing Program Provides as compiete a picture as possible through psychometric and educational tests given by the psychologist in residence. 2. Interviews An initial interview to discover interests, temperament, etc. of the inmate, through the mediu~n of a. Group meetings Original contact and once a week thereafter, evenings. TWO separate classes: pzrole riolators and first commitments, earil group for a period of fifty-five minutes to an hour. An evening, preferably Sznday, to be chosen when there are no educational activities in progress. b. Individual Interviews These take place in the office of the guidance director. The purpose is to get a picture of the girl, as she sees herself, as jvell as her uneoncious revelation of herself. Tlle interview covers the folloiving points: education, interests, work prefer- ences, work record, personal history, filling out of \"Voca- tional Interest Blanks\", conclusion. The Reception Period 1. Placement in Reception School Program by the Director of Education. After the quarantine period in the hospital, usually a two week period, the girls are assigned to a cottage for the trial interval of sis weeks. 2. Tryout Training During a six week period the girls are given an opportu~lity to orient themselves to thc life of the institution and to participatc in various tryout courses. 102 Correctional Education Today The Guidance Program 103 a. Toward the end of the tryout period reports on the achieve- ment and adjustment are assembled from those who have had t,he girls under observation since their arrival at the insti- tution. b. Reports arc interpreted, case histories studied, and test results analyzed by the service unit. c. Tent.ative program for training is mapped out. d. Classification Decision. (1) Confirn~ation of program by the entire classification group. (2) Init,iation and execution of program. The Permanent Cottage Period Then follo~vs the transfer of girls after a classification program has been made. She now has an opportunity to obtain the training and achievement records necessary to earn her parole. The Parole Period Preparation for this begins as soon as a girl has entered the insti- t,ution. Some of the steps leading to this are: 1. Close relationship between the parole officer and service unit for the better understanding of the girl's home environment. 2. Preparation of girl for a better adjustment to home after release. 3. Preparation of home for reception of girl after release. 4. Consultation of guidance worker with the parole officer during the parole period. 5. Encouragement of girl during parole period by letter or visit when practical. KEW YORK STATE VOCATIONAL INSTITUTION The Reception-Quarantine Division is in part-time charge of a teacher trained in educational work for problem cases, and the afternoons and evenings arc given to various guidance and educa- tional activitics, the aim of which is (1) to break down the inmate's (listrust, and (2) to acquaint him with the opportunities for advance- rnent while in the institution. When the boy appears before the Vocational Assignment Committee, he has already had an opportunity to see something of the vocational possibilities of the institution and he is cncouragcd to express his preference as to trade training assignments, parti- cipation in recreational activities, etc., and assignment is made according to the wishes of the boy when this agrees with other findings. The arbitrary allocation of individuals to the main- tenance squads is avoided as much as possible, for it is felt that a, far better psycl~ological approach to the boy's adjustment is obtained when he is permitted to have a word in his assignment. In view of the fact that many boys are uncertain as to their vocational ambitions and three weeks in Reception-Quarantine is too short a period to make a decision, provision has been made for reviewing cases at regular periods. By the time the boy has had his first or second review some indication can be given him of the length of time before parole will be considered. The setting of the definite \"bit\" to be served is avoided; rather the boy is given to understand that adjustment and cooperative effort mean early parole. The period of reception is also used as a preparation for life in the institution. This is regarded as a most important cducationd opportunity. So much depends upon a proper attitude tonarc\\ thc program, that every care is given to creating an intelligent under- standing both as to his needs and to the agencies for fulfilling them. At the end of the period a boy has chosen an occupation satis- factory to himself and society with sufficient compensation to enable him to maintain himself and his dependents and he understands the importarlce of the choice he has made. Since these objectives cannot be obtained by a single type of program, the curriculum possibilities of the institution include: training for a vocation, related trade theory, rclnted academic work, social studies, music-vocal and instrumental, physical edu- cation (gymnasium), health and hygiene, rccrcational pursuits, athletics, reading, hobbies, dramatics; social-movies, special pro- grams, etc.; religious activities. 104 Correctional Education Today Conclusion The conclusions to this chaptcr arc implicit in a11 the foregoing test. For emphasis, however, some of the outstandi~lg poi~lts are re-stated : 1. Beyond everything, the vocational guidance staff must be highly trained, and all other members of the institutional staff must receive sufficient training in vocationd guidance techniques to be fully cognizant of the purposes of guidance and to be sym- pathetic with its activities. All that may be planrled for cooper- ation and coordination comes to nothing if the staff members are unprepared. 2. Sound job placement upon release is one of the major goals of the guidance program. This can be aceomplisl~ed only with the thorough going cooperation with parole. Implicit in all guidance is the parallel activity of prison and parole. 3. The entire program of vocational and social training in the institution must grow out of the needs of the prisoners as well as out of the dcmnnds of society. Those in charge of the various phases of institutional life must at all times check their procedures uith the mass of invaluable information always available in the guidance department. In this sense, the guidance department can be a coordinating agency for a11 the other beneficent influences brought to bear upon the prisoner. Conversely, the guidance department must orient its own activities in accordance with realities of institutional life. 4. Finally, the entire guidance program must be continually evaluated in terms of results accomplished. These results will appear in the follorv-up of released prisoners. To the extent that they are absorbed among the normally good citizens of the com- munity, the guidance program, along with $11 other institutional activities, will have functioned successfully. CHAPTER VI THE PROBLEM OF CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT ' by Walter M. Wallack Director of Education, Department of Correction State of Kew York Some Basic Considerations in Approaching the Problem Education in t,he correctional institution has one basic purpose: to provide a series of interesting worth-while experiences \\vhich will lead to desirable changes in the behavior pattern of the inmate so that while incarcerated he \\\\-ill deveIop willing~less and ability t,o live satisfactorily in society after release from the institut'ion. By living satisfactorily in society is meant: 1. Thc adoption, by the individual, of aims which will stimulate actions which contribl~te to the betterment of society. 2. The development of correct mental and enlot~iorlal adjust- ments to the environment bot,h within t!le institutions and in free society. 3. The acquiring of informations and techniques necessary to deal satisfactorily with the situations the inmate will meet upon being released. The dcvelopment of correct mental and emotional adjustments or readjust'nlents and the desire to n~nke good depends very Inrgcly upon the discovery, stimulation and nlnturation of interests, appre- ciations, aptitudes, and abilities to the end that they mny eventu:ltc in desirable action. Mcntnl ahd c~notion:ll ndjurtments ~3tisfactory living and desirable is a dcvelop- mental proccss, the out,colncs rcquiremcnt for tr:111sit,ion thc mrntxl and correctional inst,itution 'Tl~e writer or another in the prcpxrntion of t.his Cliaptcr. 106 Correctional Education Today I'he Problem oj Curriculum Development 107 should be limited only by the ex-tent to which adjustment or re- adjustment is dependent upon tlle necessity for lear~iing ~(j~iietliing ncw, relearning or unlearning something. This requires the broad- est possible interpretation of the term \"education\" in the correc- tional program, and by the same tolien of the limits, nature, and content of the curriculum. It may be said, then, that the curriculum in the correctional institution consists of all the experiences and materials xliich are utilized in the learning process, the organization of these into usable patterns, and the methods by which learning is guided. In developing the curriculum, it is necessary to determine what educational purposes are valid, what education can be pur- poseful, and how the education provided can be motivated for efficient and genuine attainment of outcomes. It is always necessary to consider for what type of individual the curriculum is to be constructed. In general, in spite of considerable opinion to the contrary, there is no evidence that inmates of correc- tional in~t~itutions are markedly different biologically from the ordinary mass of humanity. It does appear that there are among the inmates of correctional institutions a somewhat disproportion- ately large number of definitely feeble-minded and psychotic per- sons, but the intelligence, physical development, and emotional reactions of the prisoner group do not devjate from the normal as much as is commonly believed. However, the prisoner group is under-educated when compared with non- prisoner^.^ It is also true that inmates' attitudes are on the whole more unsocial or anti-social than is the case with the non-criminal. For example, many inmates have certain antagonisms to school which must be overcome, and certain scholastic and character weaknesses needing correction. But significant differences between inmates and non-criminals seem to be very largely the outcome of mal-development. 'Such differences are chiefly social in nature. Perhaps it might be said that prisoners are %.quite deficient in what might be called \"social intelligence.\" Psychological understanding of the learning process must be expressed in the institutional curriculum. Moreover, there should :~lso be expressed a knowledge of what is commonly called \"inmate psychology.\" Learning as a process is continuous and develop- ~nental, ~vhcther or not that which is learned be \"good\" or \"bad.\" The whole individual and all the elements of the environment make ~IVallack, Walter AI., ICendall, Glenn &I., and Briggs, IIoward L., Education TYithin Prison of Publicntions, Tencher's Collcgc, Columbin Un~verslty, 1939. a learning situation. The outcome is a pattern of thought and action which is the integrated result of thc inter-play between individual traits and environmental forces. What an individual is today, lie was not yesterday, nor \\vill he be tomorrow. Since growth and development can be controlled within certain limits, the psycho- logical problem for the curriculum maker in tlie institution is to provide experiences and \"learning content\" which will control the growth and development of individual inmates in terms of their individual limits and needs. This directs emphasis toward the study of individual inmates. What are the characteristics of Inmate X? \\Vhat are his person- ality traits? What are his assets and his liabilities? How may we account for them; that is, Why is he what he is? What en\\iron- mental forces in combination with inherited traits have tended to develop his socially objectionable conduct? JJ'liat are his devclop- mental needs? How should his growth be directed or re-directed? What are his limitations? In short, what does he think? U'hy? I-Ion: does he act? Why? What may we do about it? Because some or much that the inmate of the correctional institution thinks and does is socially unacceptable, it is evident that a great deal of that which he has learned has been \"bad.\" The task, then, is to combat \"bad learnings\" with \"good learnings.\" It has been demonstrated that this can be done, but only when through experience the \"good learnings\" can be made to apprnr more valuable and more satisfactory to the innlate than were the \"bad learnings.\" Unfortunately, many prison inrnxtes nevcr had an opportunity to esperience the p1easural)lc effects of what many of us believe to be \"good learnings.\" I-Ierein lics the key to a certain amount of success for tlie educational process ns an elernent in correctional trrstment. Furthermore, many of the critics of Xnlerican penal institutions justly complain against the \"bat1 educations\" commonly prevalent in many institutions. Crime schools, they arc cnlled. Perhnps if there were no hope wllatcvcr for the rcllni~ilitatio~~ of in~nntcs through cdiicati011, it ~vould still be worth-n-hile to place a curricu- lum for constructive education in the penal institution in order to displace the dcstructive ed~lcation occurring in unn-l~olesornc insti- tutionnl situations. So far as \"inrn:~te psychology\" is concerned, it is pmctirnl to attack personal liabilities through capitalizing individu:ll assets. 108 Correctional Education Today The Problem of Curriculum Development 109 Rloreovcr, the inmate should be approached in terms of his matu- rity, present attitudes, and past experiences. Since education in the correctional institution is largely a social problem, social, economic, and industrial conditions and trends must be const:tntly and rigorously studied by those responsible for correctional education. They must attempt to know under what kind of social economy the world is operating at the present time, what elements of the social order have been responsible for delin- qucncies, what changes our social economy seems to be undergoing and what. effect these may have upon the inmate. The socio- economic situation vitally affects correctional education in two major respects: 1. The various activities included in the curriculum will be effective to the extent to which they take account of and respond to social and economic conditions and changes. Soine curriculum materials valuable ten or twenty years ago are rclativcly useless now. 2. Delinquency and crime seem most frequently to be the out- come of lack of adjustment between the individual and his environment. Major emphasis in correctional education should be placed upon securing understandings of social and cconomic forces and problems such as the interdependence of groups arid individuals, and the relationship of indi- viduals ant1 government. Too oftcn education in correctional institutions seems to mean only a few classrooms in which the three R's are taught, whereas, the program sllould be inclusive enough to embrace all those activi- ties of the institution which aim at changing behavior patterns. Athletics, group work, shop work, the library, institutional main- tenance work, and recreation should be considered as parts of the educational program. Some Guiding Principles As a result of the experience gained in reorganizing the educa- tional programs in thc Departnlcnt of Correction of New York State, certain principles, in the .nature of criteria for curriculum construction, 1)ecame apparent. They are summarized as follows: a. Prison and reformatory education is largely a problem of adult education. b. In d(~alirig 1) ith inmates the educational task of implanting, fostt,ri~~g, :inti rcco~istructing appreciations and attitudcs is of as 11111ch fundamental importance as training in academic or vocational skills. Therefore, curriculum construction must begin with a study of inmate ed~~cational nceds, atti- tudes, and interests. c. Relationships of subject matter to something basic in the inmate's situation in life must be apparent to him. This is equivalent to saying that the materials of the curriculum must satisfy needs which are felt by the individz~al whom we would teach. This is good pedagogy always, but in the education of inmates it is of the utmost importance. Some who have studied the \"psychology of inmates\" inform US that prisoners are, as a rule, self-centered individuals. Prac- tically, n7e have seen that it is frequently necessary to drive the small, entering edi~cational wedge through some vital personal interest of the inmate. That interest seems fre- quently to be his most vulnerable spot. The chief interest of any prisoner is usually the day and period of release on parole. Thus, education should be pointed directly toward this interest. d. Instructional materials must be developed so that they lend themselves to the esploratory intercsts which learners may have, or which they may develop. Beginning with one activ- ity close to the interest of the student, this of itself must icad to other activity. 3lere su~gestion of further activity is not enough. Many learners in ~nstitutio~lal classes scem to have natural inclination for csploration or to develop such in- clination as a result of confinement. e. Materials are most usable when they are on proper maturity levels of interest and language, but there must be due regzrd for variations in mentality, educational status, and social baclqg-ound. f. Both from the standpoint of interest possibilities and useful purpose, all materials must be of a n&ure to include highest possible social and economic (or vocational) values. g. Materials are most usef~ll when set up in AREAS OF IN- FORAfhTIOK to be organized into projects and then, possibly into study units. Organization of nlaterials should permit nlnsinlum self-direction. hlorcovcr, all information included must be strictly up-to-date. In teaching related vocational information greatcst succcss is achieved rvhcn such teaching is done in thc shops. h. So cnllcd drill work has its proper2pl,zce slid cannot be avoidccl. The averagc learrier in ~vislics to know to mal;e arithmetic computat,ions accurately and easily. EIe \\voulcl rather not be able to nzrnc the states which bound nnothcr, ulilcss he can do SO mitllout error. i. Inmates like the authority of the printed word. Good library facilities are esscntinl. j. Visual aids, particu1:trlg sound-motion pictures, have great uscfulncss as devices in teaching. 110 Correctional Education Today The Problem of Curriculum Development 111 k. There is room for some lecturing, particularly when done by \"personalities\" from outside the institution, but \"preachy\" moralizing always leaves ('transgressors\" in institutions somewhat cold. 1. There should be instruction specifically aimed toward ad- justment on parole. m. The curriculum must be organized around (1) fundamental or tool subjects (academic); (2) vocational training; (3) mental hygiene; (4) personal hygiene and health; (5) social studies; (6) direct att,ack upon anti-social attitudes; (7) in- dustrial and maintenance lvorli; (8) music and fine arts; (9) handicrafts; (10) physical education; (11) leisure time and rccreational activities; (12) special classes for therapeutic purposes. Effective Curriculum Planning Must be Realistic Ideally, tlie scope of a comprehensive program, and therefore the scope of the curriculum, would be limited only by the educational needs of a given group as determined by analysis for the purpose of discovcring nccds. Ho~vever, in practice many other limiting factors are encountered, such as, non-effective classification and segregation for training; unfavorable administrative policies; limited, petent, or unsympathetic personnel; insufficient funds; inadcquate physical facilities; and the like. A test of the leadership ability of educational 1%-orkers in correctional institutions today is the ingen- uity they display in overcoming the obstacles which they face. It seems \\vise to limit educational activities, and the curriculum, in a given situation to what may be effectively accomplished at a par- ticular time, it being understood that those responsible for the developrnent of educational programs will exert constant pressure against the unwarranted obstacles which limit progress. Therefore, an early step in the development of the insti'tutional curriculum is a siirvey for the purpose of determining what factors are present to limit the educational program, how to attack and climinate such factors, and what, educational activities may be included most effectively in facc of the existing situation. The number of educa- tional activities to be included under the types of education sng- gestcd in m forcgoing is, of coursc, limited in the same manner and by tlie same factors as limit thc scope of the curriculum. >foreover, the quality or richness of the curriculum is likcl\\.ise limited. The effectiveness of thc curriculum in thc correctional institution, as well as all other elements in correctional treatment, is especially dependent upon the effectiveness with which inmates are classified and segregated for education within the institutional system and within the individual institutions. Staff Training is Essential to Effective Curriculum Development There should be a series of professional meetings for staff training to provide a basis for the development of the curriculum. Forum discussions may be held weekly or bi-monthly. Courses in modern social and economic problems and their bearing on correctional education should be organized. Discussion of Modern Social and Economic Problems It would be interesting and profitable at the beginning of a - curriculum development program to have the group test itself on its own attitudes regarding a number of modern problems. Bruner and Linden with the aid of graduate students at Teachers College, Columbia University, have developed a check list of forty modern problems which could be used advantageously. The first of t,he forty problems is given below: Problem 1.-Changing Status of the Family a. The family sliould be encouraged and protected as a desirable unit for reproduction, for sexual adjustment, and for proper social development of its members. It should be rccognizcd, however, that changing conditions bring about changes in the form and functions of institutions, and provisions should be made for adapting human life to such changes, even with regard to the form and function of the family. b. The family as an institution should be abandoned, because it is outgrown by social changes, and it is a hindrance to further social progress. c. Family life should be permitted, but individuals should be encouraged to abandon it as an institution, because it is not instrumental in pronloting human progress. d. Thc family, in its traditional form, must be retained inviolable bccause its mairitenance is essential to individual happiness and social ~vclfarc. Thcrcfore, all laws sliould be rcpealcd and all conclitioris removed which provide for the separation of nlcnlbcrs of a fnmily. e. Thc family, in its present form, should be retained as the insti- tution lcgally designated as the unit of reproduction and sexual adjustment. Individuals, ho~vever, should have some 1rg:ll nleans of escape froln estrc~ncly unhappy family relationships, provided the best iutcrcsts of younger or helpless members of the family are considered. 112 Correctional Education Today Meetings could profitably be given over to, important social, political, and economic problems. These might be selected accord- ing to the criteria3 developed by Professor Bruner listed below: 1. The problenl should be significant in present day society. 2. The problen~ chosen should be one nrhose solution is of moment to most of the population. 3. The problem should be one which can be accurately and realis- tically deceloped. 4. The problenl should be one which lends itself to the appropri- ate and natural use of materials in such fields as science, history, geography, government, economics, sociology, and aesthetics. 5. The development of a problem which is apt to excite prejudices and biases should be such that those aspects which do not call forth st,rong feeling a.re introduced first. 6. The problem should be one which challenges the interest of learners or one in which their interest can easily be aroused. 7. The problem should be such that it can be understood at the age and intelligence level at which it is presented. 8. The problem should be treated in such a way that trends which hold implications for the future may be brought out and dis- cussed. It would be well to have a list of problems similar to the following before t,he curriculum group. This list of topics was used by the Committee on the Collection and Construction of Curriculum Materials and the Society for Curriculum Study. I. 16. The Changing Family American Life 17.

Latin American Relations Some discussion should center around the problems of maladjust- ments in vocations and the possibilities of change caused by technology in the field of vocations. The chief aim of discussions should be to give the instructors awareness of the changing social and economic scene and possibly to stimulate them to read more about such problems than they do at the present time. An up-to- date reading list on contemporary problems nlay be developed by the staff group. However, many lists of this kind hnve been pre- pared by study groups in universities and may be obtained. Discussion of Ed~~cational Theories Although the educational implications of social and economic problenls discussed would be brought out as far as possible, the group should devote five to ten meetings to a discussion of cducationnl theories. The different points of view are shown fairly well in the lists of books and magazine articles contained in a \"Tentative List of Approaches\" which has been devel- 114 Correctional Education Today . The Problem of Curriculum Development 115 oped by Dr. Bruner's students. This list is compiled under the following sub-heads: General References on Basic Philosophies: sociology, economics, and psychology; Approaches to curriculum construction which have been used: (a) child experience approach (which ~vould need interpretation for adult groups, but is illustra- tive), (b) creative values approach, (c) frontier thinkers approach, (d) socio-economic approach, (e) social values approach, (f) social statistics approach, (g) educational shortages approach, (h) emo- tionalized attitudes approach, (i) adult necds approach, (j) activity analysis approach, (k) objectives approach, (1) scientific approach, (m) prcsent practice approach. At least two meetings should be devoted to a discussion of modern psychologies and the effect their application would have upon some of thc xork now going on in prisons. Because group discussions are of such great importance not only in curriculum mork, but as well in the whole development of edu- cational reorganizntion in institutions, they should be carefully plnnncd. It is characteristic that in a comparatively new field sucll as correctional education there are many controversial ques- tions. Thcre is a tendency for the deliberations of institutional grollps to take on the nature of debating societies, or to wander aimlessly toward the irrelevant. Discussions should culminate in tangible output,. Leaders of groups should study references like the folio\\\\-irig and then put on paper a course of procedure: Auble, Paul \\V.

Enlisting the Cooperation of Guards In the developing New York program recognition is given the fact that guards may participate valuably, particularly in certain guidance functions, in an informal, but no less important way. Guards, generally, have more and closer contact with the inmates than other staff members. The guard usually has a better oppor- tunity than any one else to \"get next\" to the inmate under his charge. If the guard is to take best advantage of his opportunities he will have to be trained for that purpose. It is, therefore, im- portant that these contacts result favorably for the training pro- gram. Moreover, guard activities must be co-ordinated with all procedures. Dr. Glenn M. I<endall has worked out one unique approach to training the guard for cooperation with the educational program. Experimentation with such a plan was carried Dn at Wallkill Prison and the New York Statc Vocational Institution at West Coxsackie under Dr. Kendall's direction. An outline of the plan follows: I. Introduction A. The possibilities of Conversation. 1. The importance of chance or apparently insignifi- ' cant statements. B. How the guard can function in the program. 1. Observing and reporting the attitudes, interests, abilities and apt.itudcs of inmates. 2. Discussing changes taking place in the outside world. 3. Giving information about new activities in the prison. 4. Stimulating new interests and ideas. 11. Preliminary Study of Inmates' Interests and Activities A. Report just what activities inmates engage in during their free t,ime. B. Report what inmates talk about. C. Assist in orgnnizing the interests and attitudes of men on the basis of A and i3 above. D. Study individual inmates to know their interests so that new ideas or activities may be brought to them. 111. Preparing for Co?~versation witli a Purpose A. Sct up definite objectives. B. The guard should get s good background on the main points of the subject to be discussed. 116 Correctional Education Today C. Find vehicles to introduce and carry out objectives. 1. Explain eshibits provided. 2. Compile a list of likely topics for discussion. 3. Find illustrations of and ways for illustrating topics. 4. Seicct practical, interesting current events and incidents. IV. Methods of Carrying on Conversations with a Purpose A. Opening techniques to be used in starting the conver- sation. 1. i\\ial;e provocative comments, also ask questions to stirnulate interest and thought. 2. Be concrete in applying any method used. 3. Start with a specific incident, a particular picture, clippings, object, and the like. 4. Dcgin conversation with one or t~vo or three individu- als, rat,her than with a group. 13. Steering the trend of talk into objective channels. 1. Use direction and tact in selecting and ignoring lcncis. 2. Prevent trivialities from consuming the time and attention of participants in order that it will not degenerate into a \"You're a goddarn liar\" fest. 3. Steer the talk to~vard sorqe definite conclusions. It may be necessary to arrive at tentative conclusions first. 4. Inject questions so that vital points will he con- sidered. 5. If interest lags, don't try to force continuance of talk-switch to something else or \"lay off\" for awhile, or move to new \"projects\". 6. D~:LIV comments from all men in the group if possible. V. lTTays of Making Talk Result in Action. 1. 'Then interest appcars, suggest things to do or to read so that ideas will be carried further, investi- gated, or turned into activity. 3. Pick up interest and suggcst to a man or challenge hinl to find out facts or further information to rcport to the group tomorrow. This will shift initiative to the inmate. 3. Guide individuals or groups with like interests into more organized discussion groups or activity groups, classes, etc. This will tend to crystallize the project. The Problem of Curriczclum Decelopment 117 VI. Using the \"Cycle\" Techniqzte. 1. Vary the topics, do not hammer a particular one time after time until it becomes monotonous. 2. Arrange a tentative schedule of ,topics using 3 certain topic one day, another the next, etc., and then returning to the first topic with a different approach after a week or a month. VII. Some Basic Principles, for the Guard in Conrerstation. 1. Handle the rudder, but let men do most of the paddling. 2. The guard must keep his activities informal and natural. 3. The guard should be inspiring rvitllout perspiring. 4. The guard should be sure to make the approach to a top& interesting. 5. The guard should guide and avoid \"telling\" or Chart I illustrates further how a project of this type may be carried out. This particular plan was used ~vith a group in one of the cell-blocks. The group met in the cell-block recreatioi~ room after suppcr. While institutional staff training is necessary for many rcasons, it is particularly essential if educatio~lal programs in institutions are to operate most advantageously. The State of XCLV York has launched an extcnsivc program for thc training of guards. This program is described in detail in the writers' book, The Training of Prison Guards in the State of New York4. The interested reader may refer to this volume for a discussion of the curriculum of the program and its development. The syllabus of the ten btlsic courses may also be found there. -4 brief description of each of these courses is given in Chapter VIII of this Year Book. Discussion of Crime and Correctional Institutiolts The entire institutional staff should think through as objectively as possible the causes of crime, the function of corrcctional institu- tions, the major objectives of each phasc of the instituion::l pro- gram, nnd conclusions should bc drawn as to what cllanges should be ~nade in the program of the institution in the light of the study made by the group. The educational staff should concentrate 4Published by the Burcau of Public3tions, Teachers College, Columbia University New York, 120 Correctional Education Today entire personnel or representatives of each type of personnel should participate in the development of tl~e curriculum.

A similar plan was used at the New York State Vocational Institution at \\\\rest Cossackie, h'. IT. The following conlmittees mct regularly, set up objcctives, and planned courses of study in the rcspcctivc fields: practical English, fundamental and trade mathematics, social science, drafting and shop drawing, trade science, health and recreation, elementary education. Such ambitious curriculum development projects may, undoubt- edly, be impossible in many institutions. What can be done in a prison xvherc therc is a single civilian in charge of the educational program who must carry on with no assistance except that which inmates can give? Such a situation is far from hopeless if the edu- cational director has imagination and energy. Oklahoma State Penitentiary produced a very commendable Manual and Course of Studv on Pri~on Education in 1037. The entire book was pre- psrcd by inmates under the leadership of Chaplain A. R. Garrett, who was also Director of Education. Sing Sing Prison is now in the process of revising the curriculum. The staff consists of the Director of Education and three civilian tcachcrs and tuenty inmate teachers. One civilian tcacher is responsible for supervising the revision of the curriculum. A syllabus is being developed which sets forth in some,detail the information, attitudes, concepts, and skills to be taught. Regular ~veelily nlectings of inmate teachers are utilized to assist in the development and to discuss new materials and methods tried out. It is important that the educational staff, be it one man or one hundred, accept responsibility for developingna curriculum which is based on sound objectives, which include only problems and materials nit11 real social significance, and which is based on inmate needs and interests. , . The Selection and Organization of Teaching Materials After the procedures indicated have been well begun the group will bc better able to tnlk about the preparation of curriculum materials for the diffcrent classcs in the institution. Probably from four to ten meetings should be devoted to discussing the preparation of cllrriculum materials and the kinds of adaptations ncedcd in institutional classcs. During these discussions, the groups should have before them sample materials, such as: (1) units from different cities in the country-(a) Houston, Texas, where single mimeographed units can be sccurcd at very reasonable prices, (b) Fort Worth, Texas, where numbers of units arc contained in recently published bulletins, and (c) South Dakata State Department of Education. (2) units from other corrcctional institutions, notably those of the Federal Eureau of Prisons, Nelv York State and City, 'CVisconsin, Minnesota and Connecticut. A supplementary list of Judged Outstanding Courses of Study which would be very useful in tlle selection of units may be obtained from Dr. Herbert Bruner, Teachers College, Columbia University. Ordinarily, adaptations will have to be made of any existing materials since very little is available in institutions. While tliousands of teaching units have been prepared in the Kew 1-ork State Department of Corrcction it is impractical at this time to distributc thcm to othcr institutions. In thc socio-economics field, Dr. Glenn AI. I<endall's booli, \"The Organization and Teaching of Social and Economic Studies in Correctional Institutions\" nil1 be very valuable. I dlV11 Perhaps the most important conclusion which may be d-' from recent cspcrience in reorganizing and developing curriculunls in correctional iristitutiocs is that educational activities slio~ild be selectcd becausc of'their importance in assisting inmates to solve personal, social, and economic problems better. No subjcct, or subject-matter is \"sacred.\" That is, we tezch English, arithmetic or plumbing not because they are required in public school courses or because they have long been taught, but because we have pretty definite cvidericc that such activities can contribute to the improve- ment of thc individr~al inmate. Decisions must also be mndc as to what English, what arithmetic, and what plumbing slin11 be t3:lght. These dccisions should be made only nfter fairly definite cvidcnce is availnblc that the information and sl;ills arc usable and arc more important than somctliing else. Esaii1iii:~tion of courscs being taught in corrcctional institutions reveal much questionable niaterial such as outnlodcd or unimportant grammar, arithmetic, 126 Correctional Education Today The Problem of Curriculum Development 127 and vocational information'and skills. Dr. Kendal16 has suggested tlic following areas which might guide the selection of activities and materials: A. As a worlier. 1. I'roblcms common to all workers. 2. I'roblems involved in specific vocations and occupations. 3. Problcms peculiar to the released inmate. B. As a member or head of a family. 1. Problcms involved in family relationship. 2. Problems involved in spending and saving. C. As a member of other social groups. 1. Problems involving crime and its consequences. 2. Problems involved in getting along with others. 3. Problems involved in social and economic arrangements. 4. Problems involved in securing good government. 5. Problems involved in education and religion. D. As a user of leisure time. 1. Problems involved in proper use of leisure. E. As a member of a developing society. 1. Prohirms involved in change. 2. Problcms involved in national and international develop- ment. , F. As a developing human being. 1. Problems involved in personality development. 2. Problcms involved in getting along with others. 3. Problems involved in achieving and maintaining health. The necessity of setting up clear objectives, studying inmates and the institution, training the staff, organizing for curriculum development, and selecting areas for development has been em- phasized above. A next step should be the development of courses of study in each subject or activity. The form these should take ill vary with institutional conditions. The Course of Study in Social Science recently completed in the New York State Vocational Institution is organized around fifteen problems or units. This Course of Study is for the teacher's use and indicates innlate attitudes which will probably be encountercd, desired outcomes, suggested pro1)lems and activities for class use. Day to day lesson p1:tnning is left to the teacher. This is an escellent procedure wliere IJ-ell-trained civilian teachers are in charge of classes as is the case at the Sew Yorlc State Trocational Institution.

Sing where practically all teaching is done by inmates, a syllabus is used which gives in detail the material to be taught each week to each class group; methods of teaching each lesson are also suggested. For specific suggestions on the preparation of a course of study the reader is referred to such books as Caswell and Campbell's6 Curriculum Development and Dr. Kendall's book referred to above. While teaching materials for classroom use may be organized in different ways depending upon the type of class and subject matter, the problem or unit type of organization is proving most advan- tageous in a majority of situations. A recent publication of the National Education Association7 states \"there is controversy over the various ways of organizing subject matter, but underlying the proposals for organization in units or topics or around problems is the hope of arranging materials in 'related wholes.' The organization of materials on a meaningful rather than on an encyclopedic basis seems abundantly warranted by psychological evidence. There is some evidence in studies and comparisons of classroom practice of the superiority of a unit organization which focuses content on unit ideas and which adjusts the length and scope of a unit to the maturity of pupils. Certain it is that the teacher should try to present materials to pupils in a relationship or organization which throws the spotlight of attention on the understanding or interpretation which is to be taught. The psychological importance of organizing materials and experiences into units and patterns cannot be over emphasized.\" Esperience in New York State and other correctional institutions bears out the validity of the superiority of the unit type of organiza- tion of teaching materials. Such a procedure has the advantages of providing for individual progress and differences while at the same time focusing the attention of a class or group on a common problem. The staffs of institutions could quite profitably spend two years in orientation work although certain try outs of materials should be carried on simultaneously. .After materials have been prepared, they should bc tried out in a variety of situations. Records and evaluations of results should be made as carefully as possible. Many of the nceded adaptations would come, of course, during the try outs. 6Caswcll, EI.

However, it was thought advisable to place major emphasis on social education in the discussion here for tivo reasons: first, in modern programs of correctional cducation, the principle is beconling well establishcd that all activities in the program must contribute to the social competence of t,he individual inmate if the program is to be most effective; and second, curricu- lum dcvclopmcnt procedures in vocational education arc more clearly dcfindd and understood because vocational education is concerned with the skills and information relating to spccific trades. - An cscellcnt practical discussion of vocational curriculunl constrcc- tion proccdurcs and tcaching methods may Ilandbook of Methods for Vocst,ional teacher^.^ In this Hand- book the author sums up vocational curriculunl collstruction as de- veloped in the Kern York State correctional institutions as folloivs: 1.

In Conclusion It l~s Lccn thc purpose in this Chapter to present tlic general principles and basic procedures of a thorougll-going curricululn revision program. Pcrhaps, as described, the projects may appear inordinately large and ambitious to many institutional directors of education. It may be impossible for' all institutions to carry on each phase of the curriculum development program as herein described. Moreover, every institution may not find it possible to include all members of the personnel in a curriculum revision pro- gram. \"It can't be done\" has been the slogan of correctional institutions for decades. But no sooner does someone make that rcmarlc concerning a new proposal than some other institution will be found doing it. That the curriculum development procedure described here can be carried on is being demonstrated in several institutions. Any institution can carry through a curriculum rcvision program even though it be less comprehensive than that outlined in this chapter. The history of correctional institutions indicates that they have a strong tendency to fall into ~vell worn grooves of traditional and routine procedure. The educational program in correctioilal insti- tutions is no exception to this tendency. It may be a comfort~ble feeling to some correctional educators to fcel that they have classes and courses of study whose content and procedures are finally fiscd. I-Iowever, there is no surer road to t!le loss of the spirit and vitnlity of education than the adoption of such an attitude. Thcrc is no better n ay to combat such an attitude than a continuous program of curriculun~ development. BIBLIOGRAPHY Caswell, H. L. and Campbell. D. S. C'z~rriculun~ Development.

CHAPTER VII Education of Illiterate and Near-illiterate Prisoners 131 Selection and Placement METHODS AND PROCEDURES IN THE EDUCATION OF ILLITERATE AND NEAR-ILLITERATE PRISONERS by Benjamin Frank Supervisor of Education, Bureau of Prisons U. S. Department of Justice The adaptation of modern educational methods and procedures to institutional situations involves at least three important prob- lems: individualized instruction; the existence of a wide range of ability, experience and interest which characterizes any institu- tional population; and the necessity for sufficient flexibility to providc for a constantly changing student personnel. Educ~tion in correctional and penal institutions does not imply the use of any unique educational methods or the exclusive use of one or more of the familiar techniques or procedures. In fact, the contrary is true. Any educational method, from the tutorial to the correspondence coiiise, from the lecture to the project method, is acccptnble in 3 correctional institution if it contributes to the personal develop- ment of the inmate or to the life of the institution. It is equally true, however, that because a penal institution is unlike any other educational situation, every possible educational method must be adapted for use. Since space limitations do not permit a comprehensive treatment of the entire field of method and procedure as they relate to correc- tional education, the contents of this chapter have been devoted entirely to a discussion of the adaptation of methods and of organi- zational procedures to the problem of the illiterate and borderline illiterate groups in a penal institution. The purpose of this presen- tation is to suggest the possibilities of at least one method of approach to the problem presented by this particular group of inmates. The plan of organization is based upon the results of several years of experimentation in educational methods and pro- cedures conducted in the Federal reformatories and penitentiaries. De$nition of Illiteracy - The problem of adult illiteracy in a correctional institution has considerable importance both from the point of view of its broad social significance, as well as from the point of view of individual rehabilitation. In a prison or reformatory school for adult illiterates and near- illiterates, selection of suitable inmates as pupils will depend upon the concept or definition of illiteracy. There are several definitions in common use, most of which are vulnerable to criticism because of a lack of objectivity. In the Federal prisons and reformatories a very simple objective definition has been adopted. Men are con- sidered to be illiterate if they score less than 12 points on an average of the five forms of the New Stanford Achievement Test, Primary Examination; near illiterate if they score between 60 and 65. This will correspond to an educational age of 6 years 4 months for the illiterate; and between 10 years S months and 11 years 1 month for the near illiterate. In terms of school accomplishment these scores will correspond to less than first grade and fifth grade respectively. The Interview In addition to the school achievement test results, it is imperative that the inmate be interviewed. At the time of the interview other I objective measures should be available. The chronological age mill be accurately determined and verified, the result of the physical examination obtained, and a good mental test score should be at hand. During the interview, every effort should be made to secure rapport with the inmate. It is advisable to obtain this information by oral interview, rather than a paper and pencil questionnaire method, but the results will be recorded on n prepared form by the examiner to secure unifornlity of results. In actual practice the amount of schooling claimed by the mcn will be substantially cor- rect, but this should be verified by thc social service agency. It is also necessary to question the man carefrilly concerning the last grade completed, the kind of school, whether rural, ungraded, village, town, consolidated, city or pnrocliinl. A statement of the number of years of school attendance, whether conti~luous or irregular, an impression of tvhether he liked school and succeeded in it, his failures, whether he repeated any grades, his age at quit- Correctional Education Today Education of Illiterate and Near-illiterate Prisoners 135 Between the formal testing periods for the purpose of measuring gains and for re-sorting, it is also necessary to measure progress for instructional purposes. A liberal use of flash cards, both in reading and arithmetic will appeal to many instructors. These may be purchased, or made by the teacher. \"Tlie Economy Practice Exer- cises in Mholc Xumbers,\" by Studebaker, published by Scott, Foreeman Company, are of great value in diagnosing individual difficulties in the fundamental arithmetic operations and providing a self-checking device. The economy of time involved and the individual character of the material, makes these exercises particu- larly good for beginning adult illiterates. Specific subject matter achievement tests may also be useful between the formal testing periods. These tests may be home- made. Indeed, practice in making good achievement tests is in- valuable esperience to the instructcr. He must plan carefully what teaching he proposes to do and he must have established specific aims for the class. Many of the standard textbooks on rlleasuremcnt in teaching will give detailed directions and procedures for constructing objective tests measuring school progress and mastery of subject matter. For those instructors unfamiliar with the technique, Ruch's \"The Improvement of the Written Examina- tion\" is an excellent introduction to the subject. If the budget, is limited, the application of the Army Beta and the New Stanford Achievement Test will give the basic information dcsired for classifying and sorting illiterate and near-illiterate men. Progress can bc measured by well constructed home-made tests. For a small additional amount of money, the progress of the men can be accuratcly measured by alternate forms of the Stanford Test. Estensive diagnostic tests are published in reading and arithmetic. If a more e1:tborate and precise mcasurement of rcsults is desired, the Gates Eilcnt Reading Tests, The Gstes Primary Reading Test, nnd the Gates Diagnostic Tests, may be of value in reading. A variety of tests mcnsuring arithmetical skills are also available. For illiterates and near-illiterates such precision of measuremcnt does not justify the time and money expended. It is desirable to have copies of the i\\yrcls H:~ndwriting Scale and other measures of hand- writing proficiency, but these should be used more for a copy than for csactly measuring a man's progress. Fot a11 desirable gains as a result of attending school will be measured by objective tests. Othcr factors which assume a promi- nent place in deciding whether a man should be retained in school are: (1) the will to learn, and (2) attitudes. These are perhaps bcst measured by a monthly rating report sheet which is checked by the instructor. The traits may be described on a five point basis and checked. The teacher's judgment expressed by his response to the report sheet should be given considerable weight and for adminis- trative purposes may take precedence over the objective measures. The check list and the graphic rating scale have proved useful in school situations. An excellent expositmion of this subject is found in Symondsl \"Diagnosing Personality and Conduct,\" Chapter 111, Rating Methods. Organization of Groups and Classroom Organization The organization plan for an adult illiterate educational program will be controlled by a number of factors that vary with different institutions. Among the most important items to be considcred is the number of illiterate inmates for whom an educational program must be provided; second, the number and type of instructors avail- able for such work; and third, the number of classrooms and other facilities that are at the disposal of the school administration. In considering the most suitable organization plan, it has been found from past experience that the conventional public grade school system or organization is not a satisfactory scheme for conducting an educational program for illiterates. The chief objection to the use of the public grade system is its lack of flexibility to meet the psrticlilar needs and factors involved in the program in most penal institutions. The first step in laying out a suitable organization plan is to determine, if possible, the average school populntion or teaching load that must be provided for. Such an estimate can usually be obtained from a survey of the educational and psychological testing program. These figures will provide n basis for the organization plan. If for csample, the illiterate school population is likely to range from say 100 to 175 men and there arc a given number of classrooms and available teaching personnel it becomes merely a matter of setting up a sufficient nunlbcr of groups or sections of men in accordance with the above kno~vn factors. Thcsc groups or divisions of men should not be thought of in terms of first grade, second gmdc, third grade, etc., as commonly classified in public school practice, but rather as groups of men who have a homogeneous educational accomplishment stnnding. Such group- ing or gradation of this illiterate school population is bcst made Correctional Education Today should be governed largely by the number of subjects included and the span of interest tliat is most easily maintained. It should be kept in mind that these illiterate men are not accustomed or trained to maintain long periods of sustained study and interest. Another question that may arise for consideration in the organiza- tion of such a program is the matter of departmentalization or one teacher per group. Experience with this question has led to a belief that depart~nentalization is not as desirable a plan as the one teacher --one room plan, particularly for the illiterate group. Depart- nit~ntalization in theory is based largely on the teacher specialization within a given field. This is probably amply justified in higher levels of ~vork, but in this type of educational enterprise the personal influence of the tcacher is greater in importance where one teacher remains with one group and has the opportunity of knowing the individual inmate better by closer and longer contact.. In some instances, however, where only inmate teachers are available, teacher specialization has been quite satisfactory. A definite program for continuous teacher-training in such a situation is necessary. The mechanics of this proposed plan of organization are an important part of the undertaking, and should be given careful consideration due to the relationship to, and influence on, the other features of the entire enterprise. The recommendations and plans herein snggcsted are the result of actual practice in this field rather than expressions of untried theories regarding the most suitable plan of operation. Instructional Materials The selection of content material is based on the following principles: First, materials should be purposeful, having direct relationship with the objectives and aims of each of the fundamental subjects for every group in the school; second, materials sliould be of tliat degrce of difficulty (or better, simplicity) for the particular group in question; third, materials, though on an elementary level, sllould bc adult in nature both in interest and practicality; fourth, n~aterials should be satisfactory in mechanical format. Thc aims of each of thc fundamental subjects, reading, writing, spelling and aritlimctic for each group should be definitely stated. For instance, in the lowest group or class the aims or objectives in reading might be as follo~vs: To give the men a sight vocabulary of approximately 100 words or more; to develop a fair degrce of fluency in reading Education of Illiterate and Near-illiterate Prisoners 139 simple material orally; to direct attention to the elements of words both as to sound and letter recognition as the first step in develop- ing accuracy and independence in word recognition; and to stimulate a desire on the part of the men for further reading-learning. The simplest type of reading materials must be used in the lowest grade group, in which we assume are men of no reading achievement. Marly civilian instructors attempt to make their own readers, and while this is laudable, they are apt to overlook some of the requisites for a good reader. There are many textbooks on the market at a reasonable price that can save the instructors' time ~~lliich they \\vould use in preparing mimeographed or printed copies; this pro- cedure is cheaper in the long run. The rnaterial available quite often is childish in content and has little value in interest and prac- ticality, but in the pure mechanics of learning to read, the standard elementary school textbooks will serve in giving the men at least a vocabulary and will teach them recognition of words. The reading nlnterial for this group should meet the folloriing standards: Large print, ample spaces Letween lines, lines 3 or 4 inches in length, paper that is not shiny and is of good texture, well illustrated for interest and breaking the monotony of the full page, and many other factors upon which modern, scientifically made textbooks are based. Another illustration, showing the selection of content material for arithmetic in the lower groups, may be helpful. The aims in the lowest or beginning room is to learn the numerals and count to 100; to learn how to read dollars and cents, and to do simple problenls of one and two digits in addition and subtraction, using zero fre- , quently in a drill as this is one of the greatest difficulties. There are fcw, if any, suitable tests for arithmetic simple enough in nature for beginning groups. Homemade work sheets or boolts are most effective. In Federal institutions, problems are put on the board and flashcards arid standard tcst cards are constantly in use. Indi- vidual work sheets are devised frequently for those students who can do in advance of the class as a hole. \\\\'hen lesson sheets are duplicated on ditto or mimcogmph machines special care must be taken to see that copies are clear and distinct, and that numbers are not printed too small. Thc material should be of utmost sim- plicity and \\vliere problems arc involved in subtraction and addition they should be of adult interest rather than childish. Tlierc is a difference between simplicity and childislincss. Easy problems are not riecessarily childish problems; this distinction should always be \"7 140 Correctional Education Today kept in mind in the elementary schools for adult illiterates. One can as essily ask how nluch arc 5 horses arid 4 horses as 5 doggies and 4 doggies. In format, the figures should be fairly large, distinct, wit11 p!cnty of room for answers. Neatness is always recommended \\vliether it i)e arithmetic, writing, spelling or whatever one has to do. X worlibool< of a few lessons is nluch more desirable than one with many. The latter is ~vasteful and is apt to distract from the work assigned at a particular time. In all elementary school work, material used should always be a means to the end, and not the end. They are aids to the teachers and should always be considered only as such. In the selection of all content material, one must always bear in mind that the entire program should be well articulated. In other ~vords, it must progress from the easiest to more and more difficult levels, from one group to the ncxt higher in achievement. For instnnce, it is de~irable in reading to start with the primer or book one in tlic lowc.st sc,ction and progress to book four or five in the highest clnss. \\\\'llilc thcrc must bc, of ~iecessit~y, a great deal of repetition, there must 1)e also an increase in difficultmy and word structure, length of sentcnccs, complexity of sentences and even subject matter. 3lodcr1i st:tndnrclized series of readers take care of this progression in :t srirnt,ific x.:iy. The other subjects ~vill require morc effort in ~~rcpsring for cl:~ssroom work but t.lie)- too must be so made that they are j)rogn.ssive. Addition and subtraction in aritlimctic are t:~uglit in the lo\\\\-er grades, xvhile multiplication and division and perhaps fractioris will be taught to the higher groups. IVriting can be made to progress from simple formation of the alphabet letters t.o the most con~plex composition of letters (home, business, or social) in the upper group. Continuity, integration, orderly progression, and difficulty should always be kept in mind. Teaching Methods It is not the purpose to describe in detail the many teaching mctl~ods avni1:iblc for the \\\\!ell-informed, trained instructor. Any good test or1 educational method mill provide this information. Most tcacliing rncthods, techniques and dcvices can be uscd in the tenthing of adult illiterates and near-illiterates, although tions and are dis- cussion, lecture>, or combination of any of these methods should be uscd, must IN c!ctcrmined in terms of the situation. A good teacher Education oj Illiterate and Near-illiterate Prisoners 141 dl often employ several techniques in the course of a week. The basic criterion underlying the selection of methods is: Which method will secure the most purposive activity on the part of the student? A few suggestions of methods that have been employed success- fully in prison classes for illiterate and near-illiterate adults ~vill be given. Repetition and drill are necessary in all of the elementary school subjects. Phonetic and vocabulary drill, repetition of words, continuous use of the multiplication table, repeating over and over combinations in arithmetic are of primary importance. Provision for individual differences will necessitate the use of several methods of instruction. Variation in the methods and techniques oftentimes relieves the monotony and presents the same material from a different viewpoint. Short, informal description and narration are preferable to a long dra~vn-out lecture. The question and ansver method can be used to stimulate discussion and to arouse interest. Rules for spelling and grammar are of no great value. Concrete rather than abstract presentation is desirable. Simple explanations are always in order. Constant, but very short, intensive drills from 5 to 10 minutes at a time n-ill accomplish more than intricate, locg, drawn- out drills. Take nothing for granted; find out what each student knows by asking him. A man may look intelligent, but that is no guarantee tliat he is. 1-1 well-modulated voice n-it11 an occasionnl inflection is more convincing than a harsh sing-song or loud-spcnkcr tone. If you use the question method, aslr the question firct, then call on the man. It will avoid embarrassment and will keep all the men attentive to what you are saying if they do not know until you have finished the question who is going to do the reciting. While talking to the class, it is better to stand and face the group. Certain special nlethods in the fundamental subjects have proved their worth. In reading, not only does the teacher pronounce the new words but they are also pronounced by the clnss in unison and individually. Often they are written and printed on the board so that they may be repeated by the class, after the instructor. X diversion that is popular, is to write the words on the board, then erase one of the words and have a student tell the word that was just erased. Have the nlen do most of the reading. To learn to read, one must read. Occasionally for variety, the teacher may read a story that will arouse interest so tliat men will want to reat1 more like it or even the one that was read. -4 table with supplc- mentary readers of various kinds placed in the corner of the elass- 142 Correctional Education Today Education of Illiterate and Near-illiterate Prisoners 143 room \\vherc thc men have access to it at any time helps to stimulate curiosity to read books other than the basic texts. Taking the men to the library for special reading pcriods gives the mcn an oppor- tunity to get used to the library. The librarian should play an important part in the educational program. Besides sho~ving the near-illiterate the different kinds of books, the librarian can place books which employ a simple vocabulary on a special shelf for school use. In te:~clling writing, onc may usc various methods. In the beginning class, thin second shects can be placed over the mimeo- graphed writing which one of the better handwriters among the teaching staff has prepared. Standard copy books can be used except that the practice of ovals and meaningless materials should be avoided. Thc Ayres or Thorndike handwriting scale is a great help in showing the men just how poorly they do write and the chances of improving, by referring to the higher rating specimens on the scale. Writing on the blackboard by the student can be done occ:~~ionally but as the men will have little occasion to usc a blackboard on the outside, they should write with pencil and paper almost invariably. Pen and ink may be used but it has been found that, especially for the beginners, a pencil is much more satisfactory; most of the writing done by the average adult is done Gith pencil and paper, so it is desirable to use the thing that the men will use when tliey are not in school. In spelling, as well as reading, scientifically determined vocabu- lary lists will be found extremely useful. Among the scientific studies of vocabularies and word usage, the most outstanding are Thorndike's 2000 word list, Horn's 1500 word list, Gray's 650 rvord list and Ogden's Basic English list. The chief value of such selected vocabulnry or word lists is not that they represent optimum mini- mum vocabularies to be used as a guide in developing lesson material but they estal1lis11 a control vocabulary which can he used as a Ineasure of individual progress and as a nucleus from ~vliich the student may procecd to further kno~vledge. Ear training :IS well as eyc and voice is desirable; in fact, the nlore senses that can be used in learning any subject, the better cliancc of information being learned and retained. Visual educa- tion should be us~d as a teachers' aid, as just another method of \"putting across\" content material. One should be careful in dcvis- ing cducationnl courses. It should not be considered as a course in itself-it is only one means to an end. In arithmetic, several devices can be used to relieve the monot- ony. For instance, in multiplicat.ion tables, a clock with the hours marked on it and a number placed in the middle, makes a good game. All the teacher has to do is to point to the hour, and the man reciting will give the product of the number in the middle and the ' hour. Flash cards are used extensively. Practical problems are cnjoyed, if the words are not too difficult. Standard test cards with slots for the answer are used extensively and save the time of the men having to copy down the numbers themselves. Improving Instruction Only a few of the teaching methods have been described. Standard texts on teaching methods and technique in general and on the various elementary subjects should be consulted. Such rcference books as Frccland's \"The Improvement of Teaching,\" Storm \"Reading Reading.\" Pitkin's \"The Art of Rapid Reading,\" the Yearbooks of the National Society for the Study of Education, and many others arc valuable. Most of the modern educational psychology textbooks have chapters devoted to the elementary school subjects. Reed and others have written boolcs on the same topic. An effective way to instruct in teaching methods is to have a group meeting of the teachers periodically to discuss clnssroom teaching difficulties and to suggest different mcthods to use in handling those difficulties. X demonstration lcsson, in an actual classroom by an especially proficient teacher, with discussion afterwards is particularly cffectivc. Samples of inmate student work can be shown frequently and discussed by the group. Periodic test results, both on \"home-made\" and stand- ardized tests, can be commented upon. Subject standardized tests shol~ld be given occasionnlly as a check on results of classroom instruction and to facilitate the diagnosis of individual difficulties. Careful preparation in advance must be matfc for tcachers' meet- ings and otlirr improvement-of-instruction :ictivities. Discussion outlines are desirable, so t1i:tt the discussion will bc confined to the topic. Teacher training is an important factor in an institutional school, especially ~vhere non-professionally trained teachers arc used on an cstensivc scale. In institutions where inmate tcachers nre uscd estensivcly, it is necessary to have a regular scllcdulc of tcachcrs' meetings for thc 144 Correctional Education Today purpose of providing organized teacher training. This should be an integral part of the entire program of educational activities. Reliance should be placed primarily on class-room visitation, indi- vidual and group conferences, stinlulation of esperimentation and evaluation of results. In the continuous'improvement of its pro- gram, the institutional educational department should be guided by a systematic effort to obtain evidence regarding the effective- ness of its instructional materials, methods and procedures. CHAPTER VIII EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND PERSONNEL TRAINING by Donald D. Scarborough Assistant Superintendent, New York State Vocational Institution West Coxsackie, K. Y. \"In a prison, perhaps to a greater degree than elsewhere, the most important element for success is the human element in its management. The most carefully devised system can be rendered useless or even harmful through careless or unintelligent or unin- spired leadership. In a prison, likewise to a considerable extent, tlie men in the ranks hold the key to the situation. Too long have we permitted inexperienced and unqualified men to fill the positions of guards in our penal institution^.\"^ \"Be it Resolved, That the American Prison Association endorses the efforts that are being made to bring about a better selection and training of personnel to engage in probstion, institution and psrole activities; that it views with marlied approvzl the training courses now being conducted and urges the extension of such courses, especially for those employees who are now in service and did not receive training as recruits; that it believes such training is productive not only of broader vision and more effective carrying out of constructive principles, but also of high morale.\"? There has been no failure on the psrt of leaders in the field of penology to point out the need for trained workers in correctional institutions, but it is doubtful if in any field of social or educational work a wider gap has existed than that between permitted practices in penal institutions and the best thought on the part of men of vision employed in or closelj- associated with the administration of correctionnl institutions. The general awakening which has tnkcn place in recent years is estending far beyond tlie confines of the prison and has been the cause for the appointment of such groups :is thc Lenisohn Commission to Investigate Prison Bdmiuistration and Co~istruction and the Governor's Co~n~nission on Education in Correctional Institutions in the State of Ken. Torli. -4s fact finding agencies such groups have contributed much to the meagcr 'Batcs, Sanford, Prisons and Beyond, p. 163, hIac3Iillan & Co., N. Y., 1938.

The newer conception of how to deal effectively with la~vbreakers and the influence of lay committees such as those named, have given rise to vast, improvements in the physical construction of prisons, reformatories nnd ot,her custodiaI institutions. Old laws have been changed and new laws have been enacted. Xote~vorthy anlong the IICW la\\~s is Section 136 of the Correction Law of New York Stnte ~vllich provides for trained leadership in the educational program of correct,ional institutions in the New York State Department of C~rrection.~ Thus far the achievements of the Division of Educs- tion in the New York State Department of Correction have shown the \\visdom of legal provisions for educational leadership. Un- fortunately vcry few states have taken steps along this line. In the mechanics of apprehendil~g lawbreakers and keeping in custody tilose who are sentenced to institutions, many improvc- rne1.it.s are bcing made, but what we are doing about the minds and attitudes of our cllarges is another question. Many parclees and released convicts still face the world mentally and emotiollally verse off than when they were first imprisoned. The experiences they ha.vc undergone have left them embittered and too often tlctcrmincd to get even with son~ebody who typifies the cause of tlicir troubles rather than prepared t,o live in a social group. TOO ofton, little effort is made to bring inmates to identify thcnlselves \\vith t,he \\vholesome influences which are more or less available within the institutions themsel~~es. For all of our lavish expendi- tures for ~valls, steel bars, automat,ic control devices, liospitais, clinics, shops, and other physical equipment, the inmates t,hemsclves are still subjccted to the vicious and damning influences of over- crowding, enforced idleness, enforced association with pcrvcrts and derelicts, regimentation, insufficient opportunity for bodily clean- linrss, 1itt.l~: or no recreation, and dozens of other annoyers which defcnt rather than favor an cffective program. Such \\,icious influences can be eliminated only as the statcs make provisions for adequate housing, and ma,n their staffs with corn- pctcnt trained personnel \\\\rho proudly rcg:xrd their work as a pro- fession and their charges as unfortunate llurllan beings who are to live with them for a~vhile and then return to society, and who conscqurntly must be retrained for better use of liberty. 3For the test of Section 13G see Chaptcr I1 of this Yearbook. Selecting and Training Guards The federal government4 and some states5 have set up training programs for institutional personnel, including training for both recruits and employees. Such programs have usually been confined to the training of guards. Bates describes the establishment in 1030 of the Federal Bureau School for prison officials, but relates how it was discontinued a few years later due to lack of funds and other reasons. Even so, many new men were trained and placed in the various federal institutions. Follo~ving this there was organized in the Federal Bureau an in-service training school conducted by means of correspondence courses. A few years later the New York State Department of Correction organized the Central Guard School at JVallkill Prison and nlade supervision of the project a function of the newly created Division of Education. This has become a very effective agency for the training of recruit and in-scrvice guards. Briefly, this school operates as follo\\vs6: Before candidates arc eligible for appointment to the training schoo1 thq- mllst have passed the prcccribcd as outlincd in the 1:tst examination were much liighcr than for any previous essmination and resulted in the selection of a s~~perior group of men.

Due to the beginning of tlie eight hour d:ly sclledule in correctio~lal institutions of New York State, it was ncccssary to make a large number of appointments. Thest. ivcrc made from the top of the list in order of standing arid suc- cessi~e sessions of t,he guard school were held until all vacancies )\\-ere filled. The curriculum of the training school includes ten courses, briefly outlined 2s follon-s:' \"Course I-Fzr?~ction and Duties of Ihe Prison OJiccr. This course is chicfiy concerncd nit,h the routine problems of the officer on duty. To cffort is made to train a man for work in a particular institution since that comes during the probationary period which follows the Guard School training. However, the general problems of most inlportn~icc :ire included. Emphasis is placed upon the follo~ving: Functions and responsibilities; environnlelital characteristics of the prison; tj'pc rcjiulations; tcchniyues of inaiiltaii~i~lg custody; procedures to be followed in major emergencies; making reports. Course 11-I?~n~ate Characte~istics-An Analysis of the Popula- tion of Correctional Institutions.

F , &,. 8 statistical point of view the insight of the trainee into the whole of crime. It also includes instruction with reference to the attitudes of inmates. Course 111-InJluencing Innzate Behavior. This is a collrse in functional psychology. It begins wit11 the consideration of why human beings behave as they do. The foilowing topics are included: Behavior situations and inmate attitudes which are frequently encountered by the prison guard; how institutional life affects thc expression of human wants of inmates; how to utilize psychological principles to shape the expression of human wants of inmates toward desirable social outconles; the psychological basis of relationship between officer and inmate. Course IV-Modern Social and Economic Problc7nsl T11is course is intended to give trainees nn underst,anding of the economic forces st work today and to rclate them to social change and t'o of crime; extent, cost, and effects of crime; the history and devclop~ncnt of penology; the principles of modern penal treatrilent as embodied in the \\vork of the various depart- ments of -4dtninhters I?~sti!l~!io~la! Care. TJlc primary purpose of this course is to instruct in the functions. organization, and operation of the i\\'e\\i, York State Dcpart,mcnt of Correc.t.ion. It also deals n~ith the dcpnrt,n~ents of State govcrn- mcrit related to the Department of Corrcctio~l. Course VII-Parole--4n Important Phase of Correctional Treat- nzent. This course deals wit,li the general theory of parole and tlie mcthocl of parole as operative in the State of Ken- York. Course VIII-Phases of Criminal Law and Court Procedure. En~phssis in this course is upon the correction law. Instruction is also given upon how to testify in court, the functions and procedures of the various crin~illal courts, crime and crime classification, and the correlation of police activities with thosc of the Depart~ncnt of Correction. Course IX-Physical Fitness, ~Vilitary Training at~d First Aid. Thc objcctivc of this coursc is to build up tlie physics1 qualification of trainees and to givc them cspert instruction in self-defense. ;\\lilitary drill is also emphasized as is first aid and artificial rcspirn- tion. Course X-Techniques in the Use ojFirearms aud Tear Gas. This course instructs in the nomenclnture and usc of n-capons. A sup- plcrlicr~tary part detection and prcveri- tion.\" Follolving the complet,ion of these courses the various candidatrs report for duty at the institution whcrc the vacancy exists for \\\\.hich they wcrt: nominated. Each nlnn is acco~np:ulied by such pcrsonncl records as have been accu~liulated during his session at the tr:~iliing 150 Correctional Education Today Educational Leadership and Personnel Training 151 school. This includes personal data forms which follow the employee throughout his career should he be transferred from one institution to another, a certificate of medical examination, a summary of the psychiatric examination and detailed ratings on achievement in the ten courses. Since civil service employees in New York State are appointed on a three months probationary period, and since the new guard has spent only two months at the training school, his first month on the job is his third month of probation. If at the end of the third month his services are not considered satisfactory, employ- ment may be terminated, but if the services are not terminated at that time tenure becomes permanent under the provisioris of the New York State Civil Service Law. The training procedure followed with the guards employed before the organization of the Guard School is somewhat different. After the vacancies created as a result of the eight hour day schedule were filled, succeeding sessions of the guard school were devoted to the training of guards already employed in the various institutions. Selectior? was made from among the youngest and only a few were taken from each institution during each session so that no serious interruption of the work in any institution would result. During the time at the school these men received full pay, traveling ex- penses and an allowance of $1.50 per day for living expenses. The procedure at the school for the employed men is essentially the same as with new recruits. The same courses of study are fol- lowed with such variations as the instructors find appropriate. Prom November, 1936, when the school first opened, to June 1, 1939, this school has trained 680 new guards and 251 who were already in service have completed the course. The results of this work were ~uell described by Dr. Walter M: Wallncl\\-, Director of Educat.ion, New York State Department of Correction, in an addrcss delivered before the American Prison Association at the St. Paul conferelice in 1938 : \"The morale of the entire Department has improved, according to one statement,, more since t,he opening of the Guard Scliool tallan it has during the past twenty-five years. It is now co~lccded that the morale is esceptionally high. Men fccl tliat promotion is entirely a matter of preparation for it and the demonstration of merit in the performance of duties. Recruits now reporting for servicc: are more self-reliant, more confident, and more prepared for self-defense than was formerly the case. Their srllart appcnr- ance and military bearing has toned up the appearance of all men in the institutions. A slouchy, non-alert officer is seldom sccri in t.hc prisons today. Recruits and obhers who attend the C~ntrnl Guard School upon entrance into institutional xork pass on nlnny of the things they learned at the School to others who have not yet attended.\" Training programs such as those cited above are rare indeed, but there is even less evidence of pre-employ~aent or in-serv~cc tr~ti~ii~lg for other than the guard personnel. Due to their smaller numbers nrld better initial training, shop foremen, vocatiorlal and academic teachers, nlaintcnance men, and construction foremen have 1)t'cn obliged to get along without additional prc-enlploymcnt truiriing, and are usually offered no opportunity for in-serv~ce training. Thcre- fore, even though it may be possil~le to bring into the service sl,illrd meclianics and nelI trained public school teachers, suvh cmployccs usually have had little or no training for dealing nith tlic hunlan elcnient angle in prisons and too often have little sgnlpst!ly for or understanding of this phase of tile work, and thcreforc, many of the rcal problenls of rehabilitation either go unrecognized or arc 11:tdly managed.

Those nho havc attended summer school have been granted leaves of absrncc \\lit11 pay. Such attcndance has been restricted to those who could profit most by conlpleting requirements for certificates or degrees, or fur taking specialized courses. The only drawback to rhis mcthod of in-service training is that too few mmen car! be spared during thc summer scssion season and it will require many yenrs to give nll teachers and instructors an opportunity to attend even o~lc summer session. X more satisfactory plan has been to organize and conduct este~lsion courses i~i or near tlic institution so that those ~~110 attend nlay c!o so in the evenings or on Saturdays without inter- Educational Leadership and Personnel Training 157 ruption of their general duties. Most of these courses thus far 11fivc been selected from the requirements for the New York State \\'ocational Teachers Certificate. Some have been offcrcd in tlie institutions themselves and others have been given at central points where the personnel from several institutions could attend on Saturday mornings. In order to finance the courses, the mem- bers of the classes have paid fces sufficient to compensate the teacher who is always someone approved by the State Department of Educcttion for teaching training courses. Depending upon the number of enrollees at each session the fees have ranged from $4.00 to $10.00 for two point credit courses. Thus an instructor who h:~d had no previous training might qualify for a vocational certificate ~vithout interruption to his job at a cost of from $64.00 to $160.00. If the time comes when the State Department of Education through its teacher training division can finance such courses, the cost to the employee will be correspondingly lower. The curriculum construction projects now being carried out in hcvcrnl New Yorlr State correctional institutions are proving vnlu- nble means of in-service training. Under the leadership of the department head arid under general supervision of the Division of Education in the Department of Correction, teachers and instruc- tors are producing instructional material in many subjects and are receiving much valuable professiorial training through these activi- tics. These curriculum construction projects are not something t11at can be carried out over a short period and then discontinued. As conditions in industry and society change, it is ncccssary to modify or rewrite many of the units previously prepared. Thus the teachers and instructors keep abreast of the times and keep alive their professional enthusiasm. A very valuable in-service training device hxs been found in the committee approach to certain administrative problems. For example, in one institution a committee of teachers and jnstructors were asked to draw up suggestions as to nlethods of dealing with disciplinary cases. In order to make such suggestions the com- mittce forintl it necessary to go into the problem thoroughly a:id to study it from every angle. They thus became better irlformed on the subjcct. As a result of their studies thcy became better informed than they could have become by other methods. Another committee mas requested to nlnl<e certain suggestions on some phases of the subject of inmate classification. Other committees have studied the problcms of recreation, club activities, etc. 158 Correctional Educalion Today Educational Leadership and Personnel Training 159 In many institutions subjects like these are considered purely administrative in nature and the non-administrative members of the staff usually have no opportunity to exprcss their opinions or make any contributions. Experience has shown that the men urho actually deal with inmates during their working hours are some- times in a better position to offer suggestions than those who spend less time with the inmates. As those responsible for prison administration realize the im- portance of trained leadership in a program of rehabilitation, more provisions will be made for securing and maintaining trained personnel. Favorable public sentiment, and the cooperation and support of taxpayers must be obtained, because such programs arc costly in dollars and cents. Any State Prison Board or similar administrative agency would do well to plan for the future, basing their plans on a few sound criteria such as: 1. From the Warden down, the merit system of personnel selection should prevail. Tenure must be sure. No other system has suffi- cient permanency to attract competent, well trained men. The practice of appointing retired politicians or defeated public office seekers to hold administrative posts is destructive. It deadens initiative. Such men, regardless of their good intentions, take up their work unprepared, and in many instances devote so much time to other things that the duties they are being paid to perform are done by subordinates or are neglected. In other words, insti- tution employees should be recruited from the ranks of active employees in their related fields or from those who specifically trained for institution work, rather than from the ranks of those who seek political preference. But before this can be effectively done, there must be a reconsideration of values, and a change in the philosophy that has for so long controlled the selection of personnel. Speaking on this subject before the St. Paul conference, G. Howland Shaw said: \"I have recently been examining an admirable book intcnded to assist college graduates in choosing a career. It is issued under the auspices of a leading eastern University. There is riot a word as to the opportunities afforded by social work in general and, needless to say, nothing as to the possibilites of the kind of work me are dis- cussing this nftcrnoon. That is, in large measure, our own fault. We have excluded certain groups from our thinking on the problem of recruiting personnel for our institutions and Ifre must now take advantage of the newer tendencics at work in American socicty in general and in the more fortunate groups in particular and extend the field of our recruiting. Let me emphasize that word \"estend.\" 1 am not proposing that we abandon the field which has heretofore pjven us many able and devoted men and women. I am urgi~ig that the field be enlarged so as to keep pace with the wider sense of social responsibility characteristic of American life at the present tinle.'18 And the selection of guards is just, as important as the selcctiori of other employees. In \"The Prison Problem in Indiana\", Robinson states: \"The lowest paid guard on the list has great influence for good or cvil over the men he supervises, because he is in constant contact with them. For this reason, modern prison nork has bccome a j)rofession and demands professional standards from top to bottom. It is no longer a kind of work which anyone can do, but rerluircs training and certain definite abilities. Therefore, we do not think it possible for any state to develop and maintain satisfnciory per- sonnel for prison work except through a merit system, and we recommend that the correctional institutions for adults be placed under some form of civil ser~-ice.\"~ 2. Promotion n-ithin service should either he confined to thosr n-ho have kept abreast of development,^ in their on-n field, or through pronlotional examinations that only the well informed up-to-date employee can pass. 3. Salary schedules, working hours and vacation leaves must t)e comparable with those for similar work in other branches of the public service. 4. Budgets must be ample to provide for the type of pro2ram which will interest well trained, cornpetent workers. There is 110 point in emplojing espensive personnel and then throiigll lack of budgetary provisions keep them idle or doing trivial thillgs which any untrained person could do just as \\\\-ell. 5.

More rarely still is an inmate in possession of the professional specializat,ion in t.eaching techniques required by competent teachers. c. There arc not many inmates in possession of sufficient generd or specific education and native intelligence who are available for professional training for teaching in the institutions, because such inmates are assigned by wardens to other work requiring education and intelligence, which the wardens and other officials deem to be of greater importance and necessity than teaching in the prison schools. , d. Very often such inmates as might in some degree be qualified for teaching are not acceptable due to (1) emotional instability (2) habits of ses perversion (3) internal group stresses (clique and gangs) (4) fear (I'll not stick my neck out) (5) prison-wise (I'll do my time with my mouth shut and stand in a shadow) (6) nature of crime not acceptable to standards of other inmates, rapists, for esnmple (7) dangerous individuals who would form rackets in the prison, quarrel, or commit assaults (8) restlessness, desire em- phasized by confinement to change activity (9) looking for softer, routine jobs, something more in line with former occupation, or something deemed more properly a man's work than teaching (10) desire to earn higher wages paid in industry and maintenance work. e. Inmates when acting as teachers have no real authority and other inmates know it. Such authority as inmate teachers gener- ally have in classrooms is likely to come from some illegitimate source. f. Inmate teachers are unsatifactory because they lack contact with the outside world and are restricted from getting around within an institution. g. Teacher training for inmates even where potential human material is available is meager in results in the prison because of lack of compet,ent civilian trainers, lack of teaching materials, and many other difEc~lt,ies~~.\" G. The professional staff should be required periodically to attend summer school or other appropriate training courses. 7. In ordcr to maintain high standards, provide for a rcasonablc uniformity and insure continuity through changing political scenes, institution employees should be under the supervision of a per- manent state-wide supervisory service established by la~v. Summary KO organization or service is likely to be more efficiently or intelligently managed than are the people who plan the policies rrrl(l execute the rules. Mismanaged prisons and reformatories are rlsunlly pathetic monuments to uninterested administrators, incom- . pctcncy, ignorance, or political interference. Too often all of these viers are found together. Unfortunately, as long as correctional itlstitutions are supported with public funds there will always be thc possibility of their administration being mixed up with politics. IIowever, incompetency and ignorance could be largely eliminated through selection and training of the proper personnel. Prisons and mformatories could be as well managed as are colleges and boarding achools. Just as there is no single explanation of the cause of crime and no ~irlglc measure that will bring about the reformation of criminals, tllcre is no single step that can be taken to eliminate existing wenk- ncsses in the administration of educational programs in institutions. IIoncver, since so much docs depend upon thc type of pcrsonnel employed, the answer to this problem is obvious: better initial wlcction, better pre-employment training, better n-orking condi- tions, and more opportunity for in-service training. Having said this, there is little else to add escept that carefully made plans, according to established policies and carried out over a considerable pcriod of time will be necessary in order to achieve desired goals. 'Taken from a report prepxed by the Division of Education, New York State Department of Correction for the Commission on Education in Correctional Institutions of the State of Xew Yrok. Social Education 163 CHAPTER IX SOCIAL EDUCATION by J. Cayce Morrison Assistant Commissioner for Research I New York State Department of Education Glenn M. Kendall Assistant Director in charge of General Education \\ Division of Education New York Department of Correction Time was when social education in correctional institutions meant little more than teaching the 3 R's to illiterates. Such a description still fits educational programs in many institutions. However, stung by MacCormick's arraignment of the backward- ness of practically all educational programs in prisons and reforma- tories in the United States, and by such studies as those made by the Gluecks, correctional educators are making a determined effort' to give new emphasis to education, to re-define objectives, and to develop programs which come much nearer achieving the desired ends than did the education of a previous day. The teaching of the 3 R's is nonr recognized as only one phase of social education; and the material and methods used even in this phase of the program are being materially improved. Social Education Brings the Inmate and Society Together The term \"social education'' is used here to designate all those activities in the educational program which have as their major objective the improvement of the social competence and the atti- tudes of inmates. As the term is employed in New York State and elsewhere, it refers to those activities which are planned to develop the personality of the inmate and his ability to live in a socially acceptable manner with those about him. It is as though a deep and wide gulf yawned between society and its purposes and the inmate and his purposes. It is the goal of social education to close or bridge this gap so that the aims and goals of society and the inmate are synonomous. In order to develop desirable goals, ideals, and purposes, the inmate must acquire desirable attitudes tonnrds social institutions, towards his family and the people with wllom he will live and work, and toward those elements in the community which will assist him to adjust to and improve that part of society in which he lives and moves. nut aims, purposes, and attitudes are not enough. If t,he inmate jy to function successfully in social living, he must develop the skills nr~d abilities needed in such living. Among these are the ability to thi~lk clearly, the ability to get along xvit,h other people, and the nhility to make the best use of the knowledges and skills which he possesses. .+I few illustrations may indicate more concretely just \\vhat the t:isk'of social education is: \"James A., for esanlple, is n sliillcd t*lcctrician and adequately informed in the scientific knolr-lcdgc of that trade, but he is constantly in trouble with enlployer or fcllow- crnployce as a result of fancied slights or petty misunderstandings.

Iris riucccss is thereby limited and he is dependent upon othcrs. 13ill not only lacks trade skills but carries a chip on his shoulder nnd thinks that everyone is crooked, that govcrnmcnt is a racket, 2nd th:lt the only nay to get along is to be sure of yollr own 'cut'. IIis nott to is 'do the other fello~v before he does you'. A11 of these individuals are in need of social education\".' The Social Education Program Must Provide Opportunities Which Will Develop Social Competence Social competence has been the goal of the correctionnl institu- tion for many years. The Prison Congress of 1870 crnphai-ized this objective. A head teacher who began work in correctionnl institutions in 1910 stated that \"the real purpusc of tile scliool was to correct the attitudes of thc prisoners ton-nrd society.\" This tcncher went on to state that \"when a pupil liad completed the six ntnndards (or grades) she had ability to read a newspaper, rvritc Ictters, make out grocery bills, arid underst:uid elenlentary gcoq- No one today would challenge the desirability of dcvclop- ing such abilities. Ho~vel-er, modern correctional education docs ' ~~nllnck, \\iraltcr Ncw York, Bureau of Publications, Teachers Collcgc, Columbia University, 1939. 164 Correctional Education Today Social Education 165 not believe that it is enough to develop such abilites and then to hope that by some mysterious process the many desired changes in attitudes will take place. Today, we are attempting to make a much more direct attack upon the problem of developing desirable attitudes. Instead of accepting any subject, class, activity, skill, or content because it has heretofore been taught, the correctional educator must ask lliri~sclf what type of activity will be most effective in correcting ~:ntlcsirable behavior and attitudes and in developing social com- petence. Institutions and educational directors must analyze the opportunites which esist within ,the institution, plan and develop new activities which will come nearer meeting the desired goals, and redirect the emphasis of activities and classes now being carried on so that their content and method will aid the inmate to live in a socially desirable Kay before and after he is released. The institutional program of social education should include the follo~ving opportunites for developing social competence : 1. Opportunites should be provided for cooperative living. This means that situations should be arranged in which the inmate vill exercise some degree of initiative and responsibility. 2. The inmate must be given opportunites to practice tolerance, choice, and to distinguish between desirable and undesirable ends and mpans. 3. Opportunities and situations should be provided which will enable the inmate to contrast a selfish mode of living with living which places service and respect for other personalities at the center. Prison life too often tends to make the inmate even more self- centered than he was before incarceration. Through social educa- tion the inmntc should come to realize that true satisfaction and happiness come only from harmonious and -cooperative living. 4. Social education should provide opportullites for developing the ability on the part of inmates to understand and adjust to ch:inging situations. Our moving society can be very disturbing to the iildividual unless he recognizes that change, and fairly rapid change, is an i~icvitable characteristic of modern life. To live sricccssfully today one must be able to make satisfactory adjust- mcnts to changes as they occur. 5. Xot only must an individual be able to adjust to changing situations-he must be willing to accept for a time, at least, situa- tions which are not at a11 satisfactory to him. IVhen such situations occur hc must learn to loolc for socially acceptable solutions. AS a matter of fact, the inmate's very incarceration is just such a situa- tion. The extent to which he utilizes his time in prison to improve l~imself is one indication of his ability to a~cept and make the best of difficult situations. 6. Every program of social education should include classes and &ivities which will enable the individual to interpret social insti- tutions better and to understand modern society and its changes. 7. Social education has a responsibility for assisting thc individual inmste to understand himself better. 8. The inmate should be provided opportunities to develop more understanding of other people, why they behave as they do and how he can best adjust to them. Many situations arise daily both in class and out which can serve as illustrations of why people act ns they do. In addition, there should be a conscious effort in the social education program to arrange such situations and activities. 9. The social education program should provide for the expression of worthy talents of inmates, development of self confidence and the dcsirable use of leisure time. 10. Social education is also specifically charged with the respon- sibility for developing the skills and knowledge which one must have in order to carry on ordinary life activities. KO one can live satisfactorily or efficiently today without the ability to read, to writc, and to espress himself clearly in the English language. The abovc list is based on observation in Sew York State Institu- tions and a partial survey of the social education programs of twenty outstanding institutions in various parts of the United States. Research studies are needed to refine and amplify this list. Such studies might analyze case histories to determine needs, study problems met by inmates on parole, or secure espert judgments :is to the objectives of social education. A Varied Program of Classes and Activities is Necessary to Achieve the Objectives of Social Education Thc philosophy stressed throughout this entire year book is that the development of social competence should be n basic objective of the entire in~tit~utionsl program. Society will have gained little from the inenreeration of delincluent criminals unless their social attitudes and behavior have been improved. The list of classes a~:d activities given belon- is confined to those ~vhicll are usually under the direct supervision of the educational staff. Thc classification is 166 Correctional Education Today Social Education 167 for convenience only. Rlany of the activities could be listed under several of the headings inasmuch as they contribute to social com- petence in several ways. *All of the activities listed are being carried on in some institutions. Few institutions, however, have developed a progmm of social education which includes a majority of the fol- lowing activities: I. Activities providing for the development of inmate initiative, self control, and rcsponsibility. 11. Inmate advisory councils- 1. Organized as an advisory body for the entire educa- tional or institutional program. 2. Organized as an advisory body for special phases of the program, such as recreation or athletic boards. B. Institution publications managed by inmate staffs. C. Innlate managed assemblies, clubs, and forums. 11. Activiticts providing for the development of special talents and the desirable use of leisure time. A. Ilccreation, sports, and athletics. B. blusic. C. Fine Arts. D. Arts and Crafts. E. Clubs. 111. Activities providing for personality development. A. Classes in mental hygiene and practical psychology. B. Dramatics, public speaking, and debates. C. Discussion groups. IV. i2ctivitics providing an understanding of social institutions and problems. A. Classes dealing with social and economic problems. 13. Current events classes and discussion groups. C. Radio programs dealing with current events. D. Classes in economics and sociology. Ti. Activitits providing for the development of everyday skills, knonlcdges, concepts, and attitudes. A. Elcnlentary classes in reading, writing, English, and arith- metic. B. Classes in social studies. C. Classes in health. D. Classes in general science. E. Advanced classes in mathematics, English, journalism, short-story writing, literature, science, history, languages, and the like. Religious activities and the excellent personal work of chaplains, nlthough not usually a part of the educational program, play a prominent part in some institutions in stabilizing the emotions and lives of many inmates, as n~ell as in improving their social attitudes. Tilere is a great need in all prisons and reformatories for vital rrligious work which will provide high purpose to life and guiding principles of human behavior based on the timeless life and.work of thc Great Teacher. Trends in Social Education are Shifting the ~m~hasis from Facts and Skills to Concepts and Attitudes Physical education and recreation and special types of education nrc covered in separate chapters of this year book. This section will therefore deal with the follo~ving phases of social education: 1. Social activites or those clesigrled to develop tolerance, cooperation, responsibility, and the ability to get along with other people. 2. Personality development, or those activities designed to assist the inmate to understand himself and other people better. 3. Social studies, or activities designed to interpret social and economic problems. 4. General education, or those activities for developing abilities needed in ordinary living. Social A cticities This is a phase of social education which requires a high degree of leadership and sliill. Organizing and supervising such activities as inmate col~ncils must be guitled by definite objectives. Provid- ing opportunities for the escreisc of inmate initiative and bility is espcciaIly tiifficult in lnnsinlum security i~istitutiorls, nl~cre inmates of all types are usually tliron-n together. To allow inmates to have any part in planning the program or taking thc initiative and responsibility for any activity, lio~vevcr limited, will be deemed impractical and revolutionary by some administrators. In spite of the dificultics involved it ~vould appear that social education cannot dodge 'the responsibility for cnrrying on such 16s Correctional Education Today activities. If inmates are to develop social competence, opportuni- tits sl~ould be provided for them t'o practice the skills and activities needed in social living. There appears to be no better way of developing social competence than by meeting problems, making decisions, and solving differences of opinion. Social activitics should start in the classroorn by introducing group activities such as committee work and socialized recitations. In this way, a beginning can be made in a controlled situation in giving opportunities for initiative and for group and individual rcsponsibility. Xany situations arise in recreation and physical education through which individual and group responsibility and cooperation can be developed. Discussion groups also offer oppor- . . tunitics for the free expression of opinion. Following such begin- - nings, a committee or board can be organized to assist in planning arid developing some phase of the educational program such as rccreatiori arid at,hletics, or inmate publications. Finally, an ad- visory councii can be organized to assist in developing the entire educational program. In general, it may be said that it is bettcr - to approacli the development of social activities in a gradual way such as 11:i.s been described above than to try to st.art with an inmate council having large responsibilities. A number of institutions throughout the United States include sonic type of inmate advisory organization in their educational program.2 The Annandale plan of Cottage Committees represents one approach to this problem. As described by Mr. F. A. Klau- minzer, Director of Education, the plan operates as follows: \"Each cottage elects three representatives to the Cottage Com- mittee of the institution, which committee meets each Sunday cvtning with s number of the institutional staff. At thcse meetings tlic rcprcscntati~.es offer suggestions, criticisms and ask for ex- planations of policy. Beyond this, they have no powers; it is not 3 gol-crning group in any sense, but offers a place where problems may be aired arid settled openly. Ueforc tlie niceting of the Cottage Committee, each cottage has its o~vn meeting, at which the entire cottage population is present. Cot.t:igc activities and problems are discussed at this meeting, and 1\\11 quotations and comInents about spccific i~lstitution 1)rogrnrns are taken from or bwed on twenty replies to lettcrs sent to thirty-six institutions in all parts of the United States.

The hIcSeil Island report IVIU received too late to give it the recognition it deserves throughout this chapter. Social Education 169 instructions are given to the representatives as to what they shdl introduce for discussion at the Cottage meeting which they attend immediately afterwards. Suggestions, criticisms, and requests from the Cottage Commit- tee meeting are referred to the Superintendent. His decision is then reported to the Committee at a subsequent meeting.\" Dr. L. R. Conrad, Supervisor of Education, Federal Reformatory, El Reno, Oklahoma, reports that their inmate recreational council is composed of nine inmates elected by each section of the dormi- tories for four months' time. This council \"wlccts, with the approval of the administration, motion pict,ures and radio programs, arranges athletic meets and intramural base- t~nll, softball, basketball, touch-football, and volley ball schedules; ports on sanitary conditions, and fire and accident hazards, if any nrc noted by the inmate body.\" An inmate advisory council was formed in the District of Colum- bin Jail in 1934. Mr. Rag L. Huff, General Superintendent, Dist,rict of Columbia Penal Institutions, reports that \"it seemed advisable that steps be takcn to secure 3 higher degree of understanding and cooperation from inmates on the working detail than usually existed throughout the general inmate popula- tion. \\ITith that need in mind, the inmat,e advisory council was established. The objectives of the council as set forth are: 1. To obtain obedience to the rules governing the institution. 2. To eliminate, as far as possible, the all too frequently unsatisfactory action arid attitudes on the part of the inmates on the inmate working detail. 3. To take necessary steps to protect the privileges and cour- tesies granted to the inmates on this working detail. 4. To recommend to the superintendent curtailment of privi- leges to inmates who have demonstrated their lack of desire or inability to conform to the actions expected of those assigned to this detail.\" Mr. Huff goes on to state that \"this council has been functioning since the date of its establish- ment, and has given reasonable satisfaction. Its operation has resultcd in a better working rcl:ttionship, brought about principally through devclopnlent of n better nndcrstnnding and dcsire to co- operate on the psrt of the inmates concerned. It has served to ~ve those inmates something of a sense of rcsponsibility, and to encourage in them a desire to cooperate for the general good. It hns enabled the irimatc group to 11:~ve an orderly way to bring to the littention of tlie oficials of the institution pertinent information. Xlattrrs in connectiorl with the council have been handled, to 3 large extent, by the superintendent personally.\" 170 Correctional Education Today Social Education 171 At t,he hlinnesota State Reformatory for Men an inmate athletic and physical education council assists in the management of the rccreatioll program. Mr. Ralph H. Rosenhcrger, State Supervisor of Penal Education, states that \"this council consists of nine i11mat.e members selected at large by the inmate body. The council nieets weekly with the Director of Education. Sclection of officials, making decisions on any con- plaint,^, removing umpires, organizing the program, assisting with disciplinary measures, rules and regulations on athletic fields are a11 a part of the duties of this council.\" .I more informal type of organization of inmate advisory groups is the pl:in at the iMen's Reformatory, Anamosa, Iowa. Warden IT. H. Frazer, st,ates: \"\\Ve do not have a complete inmate council, but various groups or commit,tces of inmates work with various specified officers and superintendent of schools in handling our inmate commissary, or recreation :it thc institution, both competitive arid non-competitive sports, ho1)by programs, publish the nlonthly magazine The Jfou~kcyc, 2nd \\veekly put on complete radio broadcasts within thc \\valls.\" At the 'United States Industrial Reformatory, Chillicothe, Ohio, an inmate advisory council has been functioning for several years. Thc council operates as follows: \"'l'he men in the various dormitories and cell blocks have been givrn thr privilege of selecting, in an orderly manner, five men from thcir respective units, whose duty it is, as chosen representatives, to rcI)rcscsnt thcir fellow inmates on the inmate advisory council. This council holds stated meetings at \\~hicli time problems effecting the ~velfare of all the inmates in the institution are discussed and con- str~~ctive recommendations are made to the superintendent of the instittition.\" Chillicothe Reformatory and the United States Northeastern Penitentiary consider honor cottages as another method of develop- ing self control and responsibility on the part of the inmates. Mr. I\\'. J. I,allodney, Supervisor of Education at the United States Kortheastc,rn l'cnitentiary states \"as a coopera- provided, and honor cells, for t.llose ~vho escmplary conduct and special qualifications have earned trusty- siiil~s.\" JIr. Lahodney goes on to state that \"a sanitation com~nittee makes periodical inspections throughout the institution to insure that every part is in a clean and healthful conditio~i.\" From Chillicothe it is reported that \"n~signmcnts to the honor dormit,ory, which has individual rooms nnd a comfortable and informal lounge, is the highest reward which cnn come to the inmate and such assignment is based on cheerful coopcration, exemplary behavior, and willingness on the part of thc inmate selected to work for the good of the institution.\" ilnnandale is a cottage type institution and classifies its cottages ns to varying types of supervision. \"There are three cottages tl~rough which all inmates must pass before the time of their rrclnssification. These are Cottagc No. 4, the reception cottage, nrid Cottages No. 3 and No. 2. One month is spent in the first, nlicl six wceks in each of the other two. The restrictions become ~)rogrcssively lighter and privileges of various kinds progressively ~rcntcr, in each successive cottage. In order to move from one to tl~r nest the inmate must demonstrate his readiness l)y ninintain- i~~g n satisfactory record in nork and general social behavior. If IIP tloes not, he may be held back in any one of the cottages until t~is conduct has improved. Xftm he has moved into a gcnrr:~l cottage, following his reclassification, eventual admission to the prc-parole honor cottage, Cottage Seven, is held before him as a possibility to be earned by outstanding conduct and effort.\" Tile inmate publication is another type of social activity reported I)?: the Federal Reformatory at El Reno, Oklahoma, the United Statrs Kortheastern Penitentiary, the Alinncsota State Reforma- tory for Men, the Penitentiary of the City of Kew I'ork, the United States Penitentiary at Atlanta, Georgia, IIToodbourne Prison and Elmira Reformatory in New York State as one which develops a 3cnsc of responsibility and provides for inmate expression. In the irlstitutions named as ncll as in 3, good many other institutions, inmates take almost complete responsibility for the pul~lication of n newspaper or magazine. An outstanding prison publicatioll of this typc is the Spectator published by thc inmates of the St:~tc Prison of Southern AIichigan. 3Ir. G. I. Francis, Director of Education writes that the Spectator is published \"under no in regard to the articles that arc written-the if,~nat.c rditor being hcld responsible for the pul)licat.iotl of the paper. , 1 . his is a comp1et)e department in itself hxving prrss room, compos- ing room, and a room for rc~~orters. And in connection with this thcro is a neivspapcr training class wliich deals with newspaper \\rrit.in~, advertising, and a11 that goes to mnlie up the average situ- ation for a mnn interested in printing and nc~vspa:)er nork.\" 172 Correctional Education Today Another type of activity which provides training in social competence are inmate-managed assemblies. Mr. Leo Klauber, Director of Education, Penitentiary of the City of New York, states that \"~veekly assemblies at Day School and monthly assemblies at Evening School are under the control and supervision of inmate committees selected by students at both Day and Evening Schools. This trnds to make inmates more appreciative of their educationd opportunities and results in a well planned correlated program, which is stimulating to inmate thought and develops an intelligent conception of democracy.\" It seems appropriate to close this section with a brief description of the plan of inmate and staff participation in the community activity at the State Prison Colony, Norfolk, Massachusetts.3 The accompanying chart shows the organization and indicates the estent of the nctivites of the inmate council and its subsidiary committees st Korfolk. It ~irill be noted that the inmate council is given rather large rcsponsibiiities in the management of many aspects of the institution program. However, the administration retains full authority to veto any action of the inmate council and both the superintendent of the institution and the community service direc- tor are ex-officio members of the council. Among the institution activities for which the inmate council through its committees has a large share of responsibility are the following: the kitchen, the inmate store, sports, entertainment, the inmate publication, educa- tional, avocational, library, and the cooperative aid society. Super- intendent 31. N. Winslow states: \"It shall be the duty of the council to act as a connecting body between inmates and the staff and to cooperate with the superin- tendent regarding conditions effecting the general welfare of the institution. Such actions of the council as it deems necessary for the general ~velfare of the colony are represented to the staff for consideration. Such actions become effective when approved by the superintendent and staff. \"There is also the matter of joint responsibility for, through the council, a certain amount of responsibility for satisfactory institu- tional operztion passes into the hands of the inmate leaders. The principle of joint responsibility recognizes that inmates are given the privileges of joint participation in the activities and manage- ment of the internal affairs of the institution, just so far and as 1 For a xnorc complete description of the State Prison Colony at Norfolk.

There should be no abdication of responsible civilian leadership. Careful planning, guidance and direction are absolute necessities if social activities arc to lead to desirable outcomes and are not to get out of hand. I~urthcrmore, many institutions have such heterogeneous populs- tioris that any attempt to develop such activities might result in more harm than benefit. Anyone who has observed an inmate council or similar groups in scssion under skillful leadership is invariably impressed with thc ~nlues inherent in such activities for developing social con- pctcnce. Personality Development In connection with the recent Regent's Inquiry into the Character and Cust of Education in the State of Kew York a survey was made of thc opinions of employers and parents concerning the elements 1\\111cll contribute most to the social competence of an individual. Thc results of this survey showed that personality ranked number one in getting a job and number three in holding a job. This puts in concrete terms the great importance of personality in dealing \\\\it11 social situations. Every director of education in an institu- tion can point out inmate after inmate who has had difficulty in getting along with other people. The feeling of need which pcople in general have for help in tllis area is shown by the tremendous sale of the book How to Wzn Friends and InJEuence People by Dale Carncgie. It is a common experience in prison libraries to have inmates select books on psychology and philosophy. Usually the books in these fields in prison libraries are very abstruse and most inmates will get very little from them, but the fact that inmates select such books shows a desire on their part to under- stnnd hr~man pcrsonality better. X Itlrge part of the difficulty in this area lies in the failure to !indcr~tz~~d one's self and to understand why other pcoplc behave as thcy do. It is this understanding that the activities in this scctiori aim to develop. It is functional psychology, practical psychiatry, mental hygiene, and personality clcvelopment all rollcd into one. It is not suggested that tlie educational program sl~ould attempt to give ~)sycliiatric trcnt~nent. Tllc treatnlent of extrcnlcly ernotionally disturbed inmates is not the job of the prison teacher. such cases should al~vays be referred to the psychiatrist. The type of activity suggested here should be used vith so-called normal iIldividuals, but with those who are clumsy or inept in making .wcinl adjustment. Irlstitutional classes in personality development should be based on actual life situations. Describing the nervous system in great drtnil, learning the names of the various brain areas, and discussing Iligllly theoretical psychological problems have no place in such rl:~sses. Too much educational psychology has been sterile for the wnson that it has dealt only with such topics. What inmates need to learn is what to do when the foreman \"bawls you out,\" whether one is justified in getting angry, how to conduct one's self when looking for a job, how to deal with fear of failure, and similar prob- Ic~nls. Such problems can be taught in several types of situations. A11 rlnsscs in health and hygiene should include a number of units on . ~nrntal health. It is some~\\hat strange that we have been so long in rrcognizing the interrelationships of physical and mental health. Unhappiness and inefficiency is probably due much more to lack of rncntal poise and health than to lack oPphysica1 health. The importance of this phase of health education is recognized in tl~e Course of Study in Health Education prepared by John 13. Costello of the New YYork State Vocational Institution at \\Vest Cossackie, N. Y. One section of this course is headed \"Social I\\r\\laviorl' and includes units on social behavior at parties, on the street, trolley, bus or in any public gathering; in school; and in tlie homc in relation to parents, sisters, brothers, relatives, and guests. Another section deals with \"Personality\" and includes such topics ns personal appearance and social bchavior, the developrllent of ~)crsonality, qualities essential for success at work or at play, influence of early esperiencc especially in the pre-school period, nrld gradual assumption of responsibilites in the management of onc's life without undue dcpendc~~ce on others. It n1:l~. sce~ii strange to include public speaking as an avenue for dcvcloping pcrsonality. Holvever, espcricnce has indicatcd that whcrcvcr public speaking groups arc well directed, tlicy bring to thr: surface the pcrsonality strengths and weaknesses of individuals in the class and assist tlicm to overcome fears and inhibitions whicll hnvc limited their social competcnce. In Ye\\\\. York Stntc tio~ls public speaking is carried on at Wnllkill Prison, IVoodbourne Prison, and klmira Reformatory. 176 Corrcctional Education Today Social Education 177 Few institutions have attempted to organize special classes in psychology or personality devclopmcnt. This is a phase of socid education in which experimentation is really needed. However, a number of institutions are carrying on some very interesting activi- ties in this field. ,4t the State Prison of Southern Michigan a psy- chology class is conducted for teachers of the school. The 3irector of Education, Mr. G. I. Francis, also reports a personal problems class which, as he describes it, is \"a class given by the chaplain twice each week numbering about fifty to sixty men in each class, which is proving a success in regard to social attitudes and adjustments. All types of problems are presented by the inmates and discussed by the class and the answer or some enlightenment given if possible.\" ,4t the same institution a behaviorism class is conducted by inmates esch day. \"The enrollment of this class consists of forty to fifty men in each class. . . . The value of this type of work is inestimable.\" To round out this program of personality development and social behavior, Southern Michigan has a special class in hygiene and anatomy under the title of mental hygiene which \"offers a chance to improve the physical and mental condition of each person participating in this type of work.\" At the Blirlnesota State Reformatory for Men a life adjustment class is conducted. It is interesting to note that Supervisor Ralph H. Rosenberger states that ''every inmate of the institution is expected to attend this class during his confinement.\" Here is one institution which demonstrates the belief that personality develop- ment and social adjustments are basic elements in correctional education. Mr. Rosenberger describes this class as follows: \"The class is taught two and sometimes three times daily. Inmates are cxccused from regular work to attend. It takes three months to cover tlic course. Both regular and supplementary tests are used. The adjustment work covers the five following fields: selecting an occupation, getting a job, taking a look at yoursclf (mental hygiene), kecping physically fit, and a health program.\" A si~i~ilar course entitled Social Living which all inmates must attend is conciucted at iinnandde Farms. Mr. I?. A. Klauminzer, Director of Education states that \"this is a rcgular school subject, divided into units and conducted daily for three months in each classroom. Its purpose is to discuss social problems which the boy nlust face within and without the institution in all phases of life activity.\" class in functional psychology was started at Attica Prison in the fall of 1038. The interest of the group has been consistently lri6'h, and results to date indicate that the class has been successful in assisting inmates to make better personal adjustments than thcy tlavc heretofore done. The group is small, consisting of fifteen men lyittl relatively good intelligence and educational ratings. In organizing the work for such classes the advice and services of the psychologist and psychiatrist should be enlisted. It should not be difficult to secure their cooperation if it is made clear that sr~cli classes will not attempt to treat definite mental illness. Many books have appeared in this field in recent years which are intcrcsting and not too technical. The follonring books illustrate thc type of material which has proved helpful: Morgan, Keeping 11 Sound Mind; Howard and Patsy, Mental Health; Burnham, The TVholesome Personality; Overstreet, About Ourselves; Elliot nnd Solving Wright, Getting Along With People; Shively and Shively, Personal Analysis and Vocational Proble7ns; Bennett and Hand, Designs For Personality. In ad- dition to books which treat the subject from n rather popular atn~~dpoint, standard textbooks such as Woodworth's Psychology bhould be used. Social Studies A description of social studies and many suggestions as to how to develop this phase of social education in correctional institutions mny be found in The Organization and Teaching of Social and Economic Studies in Correctional institution^.^ In this book, which grcw out of the experimental project in social education spon- $orcd by the Engelhardt Conlrnission at J17allkill Prison, the follo~ving subjects are discussed: The function of social studies in correctional institutions; prisoner attitudes and correctional education; a psychology of learning applied to education in correctional institutions; procedures for selecting and planning eocinl and econo~llic problems for teaching; t!ie development of tcsclling units; the place of social studies in the educational program; teaching procedures and methods; and the social studies teacher. This book also includes eight social studies ' I<cntlnll, Glcnn ill., Organizalion and Teaching of Social and ill Co~rrctional Instit~~tions, 1)~. 159, flurenu of Publicstions, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, 1939. 178 Correctional Education Today Social Education 179 unit,s which illustrate the type of teaching materials which have prored snccessfnl in New York State correctional institutions. Since this book covers the social studies program in considerable detail, it seems best to refer the reader to it rather than to repeat most of the ideas and suggestions given in it. A number of correctio~lal institutions have for a good many years been teaching history, geography, and civics. An examination of the nlatcrials used in such courses almost always reveals that the mlijor en~plinsis in such courses is placed upon facts, dates, and the structure of governn~ent. History is usually dealt with in the tradition31 chronological may. Geography stresses the memoriza- t,ion of the names of cities, states, countries, rivers, and the like. Civics emphasis the powers and duties of governmental officers and sgencics. The cont,ent of such subjects is tao often unrelated to :tctual problems of social living. \"Trends in organizing modern social studies courses appear to be in the direction of breaking dotvn the traditional subject bar- riers. to Rugg, 'The older curriculum in social studies divided the work into geography, political history, and civics.' . . . The main criterion which should govern the organization of the study of sorial and economic problems is 'what generalizations, undcrstandillgs, and facts do people need to know in order to ~nakc dcci,iions about interpretations are the desired ends-not facts. Facts . are absolutely necessary, but they are only means t.o more important ends. For example, innlates need to understand the purposes and place of organized labor in modern industry and life. Facts are needed to form a basis for understandirlgs and decisions as to what attitude 'I' will take toward unions. But facts have meaning and significance only rrhen related to the problem itself. . . . The facts rnay comc from the field of history, or geography, or ci\\ncs, or from all t,llcsc fields.\"\" The point of view taken here, then, is that 1% should dispense ivitll subject matter lines in the social studies field and organize such classcs around actual social and economic problems and situations. Tliis change is going on in the public schools, but it is evcn more imgcratire in correctional in~titut~ions tvllere the student is an adult. The inmatc has real need for knowing how to interpret the problems of iinen~ployment, labor and capital, the responsibility rvhich government has for meeting the needs of ever). citizen, the 3 op. cit. pp. 59-60. cffccts of poor housing upon citizens, and similar problems. Such I~robIcms provide the basis for social studies. Whenever facts from the past can be of assistance in interpreting and soIving such prob- Icms they merit a place in the social studies program. In addition to regular social studies classes, the following activi- tics also offer real opportunities for interpreting social institutions nrld problems to inmates: discussion groups, forums, debates, radio programs on social and econonlic problems, and outside speakers. In addition, there are many films which can be securcd free or at m~all charge which deal witlh social and ecorlomic problems. Such films form an excellenC base for a discussion of an economic or social problcm. Westfield State Farm, and Elmira Reformatory in Xcw York State are carrying on an experimental project with the films developed by the Commission on Ilurnan Relations of the Progressive Education Association. These films are extracts from regular commercial films such as Captains Courageous, Men in Il'hite, and The Life of Pasteur. Interesting and ~~11 directed sccial studies classes and discussion groups may be found in several correctional institutions today. At hnnandale, Mr. Iilnuminzer states that \"history, civics, and geography are taught in combination and cover such units as the followinz: u I) Industrial and Economic History of the United States (srlect,ed units) 2) Occupations and Occupational Trends in this Region 3) Municipal, County, and St,ate Government Organ~zation. Government Departments and their Funct,ions. Socinl Responsibility of thc Individual Citizen. 6) Socinl Organizntion in New Jerscy. 7) Employer and Enlployee Relationships. 8) Topography and Climate in Ne~v Jcrscy. 9) Civic Organizations. 10) ~crreational Area and Privileges in New Jersey. I I) Current Events. We have tried to selcct units rt-hich are nerrlflrl to our avcrage type of inmnte. Tlie unit rolltent is modified in tire various gr:icle groups to suit their c:tpacitics.

I<. lopic . for diacrlssion (with a Education Today Social Education 181 31r. Lco Iilauber, Director of Education, Penitentiary of the City of Xcw York states that \"Classes in social studies held at the Day School, take up current econorllic and social problems.\" \"Social Scicnccs are treated by taking a period in history and dis- cussing its counterpart in geography and civics, This tends to permit a study of the social and economic trend in history, and 3 I~cttcr understandirig of present day problems results. A class in economics and public speaking for advanced students is combi~led to nlahc the courses more efiective. A group of fifteen irirnfltrs meets nightly under the direction of an innlate instructor as part of thc Evening School Program.\" Ilr. S. 13. Govin, Direct,or Wisconsin State Reform- atory states that \"the acti~qtics in our social science, econon~ics, and labor problems clnsscs xu far in improving the inmates' attitudes towards socicty. Intrr-cl:lss dcbatcs discussing the pro and con of topics that arise during stud?; lay the foundation that stimulates a class-wide whole- solllc attitlitlr which arouses interest and remains imbedded in tllc nlind.\" 111 addition to these organized classes, lccturcs are scheduled \"at intervals at nrhich the participating classes are hosts to men of i~nl~ressive experience who give enlightening talks 011 sociology, economics, and politics. Post-lecture debates discussing points of social interest are set under 11733'. Themes are written. References are consultccl for further information on the current topics.\" Every Xenr State correctional institution includes social st,udies as a part of the educatio~lal program. Il.lost of these classes have been organized in the last two years, largely as a result of the experimental project in social education sponsored by the Engel- hnrdt Commission at Wallkill Prison. Besides excellent social studies classes, Elmira Reformatory conducts several discussion groups in the evening, \\vhich consider all types of social problems. Elmira Iteformatory and Woodbourne Prison conduct debates with outside school groups. The preparation of debates calls for a search for fncts and for clear thinking on outstanding social problerns. 3Irs. Helen Valein teaches social studies classes at I~estficld State Farm in which almost every inmate is enrolled and which have brought about noticeable changes in inmate attitudes. 1lclated vocational classes oflcr another opportunity for intro- ducing ccrtain types of social arid eco~iornic problems. Under the sllpcrvision of Vocational Director N. J. Henzcl and Ncad Teacher Charles J. Scanlan, a committee of teschers hel~dcd by Mr. William Ro~crs at JITallkill Prison, allkil kill, i\\lT. Y., has made an i~ltcrlsive jtrrdy of the various trade analyses prepared by shop instructors to determine points at which social studies units might be developed. Uvcr thirty such units are now in use at Wallkill. This devclop- mcnt and illustrative units of this type are given in I<endall's ..it the Penitentiary of the City of New York, \"discussion groups have bccn held in individual cell blocks led by t llc Jlircctor of Education. Topics discussed included current events rlrltl current problems, as ~vell as problems relating to incarceration, p(wology, and parole. Groups average betneen fifty and seventy- five- and discussions were held during the noon hours.)' At the State Prison of Southern llichigan a news commentator with threc assistants, broadcasts news of the institution for the tlny. These news broadcasts are given each evening. Highlights of thc outside news are given on this news broadcast also. r\\ good many institutions provide some type of opportunity for inmates to discuss current events. The htinnesota Reformatory for hlcn conducts an open in~nates' forum. \"'Shis forum meets in the evening twice a nlonth in the auditorium. ilttcndance is open to all inmates. A civilian discussion leader opens ttir mccting with a short pro and con discussion on the evening's topics. After this introduction the meeting is open to discussioll on tl~r floor. These meetin~s are attended with much enthusiasm. :\\pproximately three to five hundred inmates attend regularly.\" In addition to this informal forum there is a regular cIass in soci- ology. 1Iuch excellent material for the study of socinl and economic prol)lcrns has been made alrailable in recent years in pamphlet forrn. The American Primer series, pamphlets of the Foreign I'olicy Association, and units developcd in the adult education j'rograms of the District of Columbia, Chicago, and New York City illustrate this type of material. Current ne~vspapers and mngnzincs should be used estcnsivcly in all such courses. The fullowing list of titles of thc Chicago units illustrates the way in t~llich social studies should focus on social problems: \\\\'hat Hopc for the Jobless? The Over-Expansion in Capital dilce?

MncCormick called attention to the wide spread ~sc of anti- q~latcd matmerials and methods in such subjects after he had survcycd the educational programs in all the state and federal prisons and re- formatories of the United States in 1829.8 Since that time there hns been considerable improvement in many institutions through the introduction of more up-to-date textbooks and attempts to ~~lacc the \\vorl; on a level more in keeping with the age of inmates in reformatories and prisons. However, one can walk into class- rooms in the average prison or reformatory today and find arith- metic problems having little connection with social situations, intensive drill upon obscure forms and rules, and meticulous at,ten- tion to the spellirlg of long and obscure words. The following comnlcnts upon the worl; of many American high schools is probably more applicable to the \\\\.ark in correctional institutions. \"I-Icre is a scene for t,he pen of a satirist.

AS the chapter on \"The Proble~n of Curriculunl Dm-elopment\" indicates, the tor- rectional educator sllould start not with some predetermined or already esistinq class or subject matter, but with the problems inrliates are meeting and will have to meet when released.

EL en in classcs for illiterates the content used in teaching reading and writing should be based on adult interests and social situations. There is no longer any escuse for a correctional institution to teach adults through tlle use of childish primers. Many persons gasped in amazement when they read AlacCormicli's statement that it tvas not unusual to find adult prisoners \"learning to read from a book that tells how Tommy and Susie went out to catch butterflies or that rli:~~)sodizes on the subject of ho~v soft and warm pussy's coat is.\"l0 IVliile no survey has been made since MacCormickls, it is prol>nl>l?- knfc to 5:zy that such tragically ludicrous illustrations arc not so numerous today.

Classes were designated 8s \"standards\" or \"forms.\" The adoption of these names many yean ago was probably an attempt to get away from the term \"grades\" as it is ordinarily used in the public schools. However, they rc- mained essentially grades one to six and included practically the same subjects and content. I11 New York State, most of the prisons have discarded the \"grade7' or '(standard\" type of organization. All work is organizcd on three levels of educational achievement: (1) illiterates and near illiterates, (2) intermediate groups for those who have a sufficient mastery of the fundamental tool skills to read and write simple materials reasonably well; and (3) advanced classes for those who have a reasonably good educational background. The results of intelligence and educational testings are available in organizing these classes. The objectives in the illiterate or near illiterate groups are of course to teach the ability to read and write and to use sinlple arithmetic processes. At the Woodbourne Institution for Defcc- tive Delinquents, Mr. Chester D. Owens, teacher, under the dircc- tion of Mr. James J. Brooks, Head Teacher, is now constructing a large reading book which is patterned after the type of book used with kindergarten or primary children but which uses adult \\vords and content instead of childish materials. It is possible to make up the simplest type of reading lesson by using material about the family, cars, airplanes, public signs, and other everyday activ- ities and experiences of adults. The work in the intermediate groups is based upon the following subjects : English, mathematics, social studies, health (physical 2nd mental), and science. At Clinton Prison and Great Meadow Prison the intermediate group is departmentalized, that is, each teacher handles only one subject. This enables the t,eacher to prepare himsclf much better for the specific work which he will teach. The old prison school conducted each class on the little country schoolhouse basis-each teacher taught a11 the subjects to s group. The new plan results in n~uch better preparation of lessons and more interest on the psrt of teacher and student. Auburn Prison is espcrinlenting with a procedure ivhich ivould climinate subjects lines entirely. In the intermediate division, the clnss~\\.ork is based upon areas important in modern living. Xeedtd I.:llglish, arithmetic, general science, and social scie~ce skills, knonl- ctlgc's and concepts are developed, based on and in connection with ~tlr rrrltral themc. TO illustrate, one Auburn tinit is based on the t,opic \"Communicstion.\" 'Khr unit begins with social studies material concerning the dcvc!lop- nlrnt of communicatio11, the place of communir.at.ion and spclling words deal receiver, cablc, camcra, :~nd nrticlrs to develop reading skills and habits are suggested and com- ~~rcl~cnsion tcsts are included; social values and concepts come in ngnin in discussing these readings; general scicnccl knon-ledgr :~ncl concepts are developed through the study of how thc telegraph works, simple principles of radio, and how talkies are madc; arith- 111ctic skills are developed through figuring parcel post rates, tcle- grnp11 rates, and postal savings. IT'ith good civilian teachers or 1r.itI1 inmate teachers under close and expert, supervision, such n I)I:LI~ gives excellent results.

W' 188 Correctional Education Today Social Education Special mention should be given here to the iWanua1 arid Course of Study on Prison Education prepared at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary entirely by inmates under the supervision of Mr. A. R. Garrett, Chaplain and Director of Education. This 186 page book, after stating the general objectives of the courses and commenting on teaching methods, gives in detail the subject matter to be taught in each division of the gencrnl education program under subject headings. The subjects included are spelling, reading, self expression, civics, psychology, English, geography, history, sociology, and economics. This book illustrates what can be done by one civilian assisted only by inmates. All of the subject matter is for the most part up to date and on the adult level. In the February 1939 issue of the Atlantian, inmate pub- lication at the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta, Georgia, is an article entitled \"-1 Casual Conversation.\" This is a conversation between an inmate teacher in the prison school and an inmate who lias a fairly good ec!ucational bacliground but ~vho has never taken advantage of the sc.11001 in the institution. \"To tell the truth\", says the skeptical inmate, \"I haven't given the school a serious thought. I have been under the impression that the teaching was confined to elementary subjects, and that the school's enrollment \\\\:is largc4y from the illiterate or semi-illiterate inmates who were more or 1c.s scnt to school as a matter of mild compulsion.\" This idea is still prcl-alent among the prison population of most prisons. It springs frorlz the fact that earlier prison education was confincd to the type of inmate and to the activities just described. TO be realistic, it must be admitted that the educational program in many prisons is still confined to such a limited program. Consequently, inmates in thc elementary classes consider that their attendance is cornplctcd when they finish the elementary grades of the prison school, and inmates with a good educational background take it for granted that there is little that they can gain from tlie educn- tional progr:im of the institution. Some prison administrators still exist \\vho feel that a man should be taught to read and write but that any cducntion beyond that is more or less wasted upon inmates. The modern view holds thnt prison educational programs must offer somcthillg of value for every man in the institution, 110 matter \\\\hat his educational background may be. Several insti- tuitons have introduced a large variety of advanced courses both through organized classes and through correspondence work. In such institutions it is possible for a man to start as an illiterate arid to complcte a college education. Sari Quentin Prison offers perhaps the widest variety of subjects, from elementary work through college, of any institution in the cot~ntry. Practically all courses at San Quentin are carried on through correspondence and estension study. Dr. Shuder, Direc- tor of Education at San Quentin, states that \"it is possible for the inmate to build his education from mere illitcracy to high school level by means of the courses offered by the local correspondence divisions. When high school level has been rrnched (or when the tested education of the inmate is above the ninth grade level) the inmate is eligible to enroll in courses offered frclc of charge to inmates by the estension division of the University of California at Berkely. This division, administered in the Depart- mcnt of Education, offers inmates all the regular courses of the cstension division in academic, cultural, and vocational subjects.\" The Minnesota State Reformatory for illen, Sing Sing Prison, Elmira Reformatory, and Clinton Prison in New York State. tlie Unites States Northeastern Penitentiary, the \\lTisconsin State Re- formatory, and the Xebraska State Penitentiary also illustrate pro- grams providing high school and college courses in cooperation with rccognized universities. Cell study, correspondence study, and c\\tension work offer excellent opportunities to add a large variety of courses to the prison program, to provide well organized courscs, nnd to add prcstige to prison education. However, care must be tnkcn that correspondence courses do not become simply a suc- cession of papers handed in and questions answered. Opportunity should be provided for frequent personal contact between instructor and student. Furthermore, in the case of social and cultural sub- jects, correspondence work can never take the place of well con- ducted classes under efficient interested teachers. In additiori to regularly orgarlized courses, whether given in class or as correspondence and cell study work, there is a definite need in the social education program for reading outlines which will guide inmates who have particular interests ~vhich they desire to follow. For esample, an inmate may be interested in the history of the developmcnt of the auton~obilc, advertising as a vocation, or even the history of the French Revolution. Even though these topics might be covcrcd in some class it often happens that an inmate either cannot because of other institutiorial duties or nil1 not enroll in the regular educational c1:tsses. Guided reading courses 190 Cor~ectional Education Today Social Education 191 offer one way of meeting the needs of such inmatcs. This is largely a responsibility of the institution library. Sing Sing prison keeps posters and h~llletins on the library bulletin board at all times which stimulate interests of inmates in the various fields and suggest lists of books which will be of interest to them. Auburn Prison has arranged certain shelves in the library on which they have brought together books on various subjects. This plan offers another nay of individualizing education to meet the needs of every inmate. Prison inmates, like other human beings, like to have sonle indication that they have achieved definite progress and to receive recognition of such achievement. It is scarcely enough for the inmate to have the educational director register on his enrollment card that he has completed the sixth grade or a course in English or history. In order to provide more definite evidence of achieve- ment, a numl~er of institutions including Annandale Reformatory in Xcw Jerscj-, se\\-cral Xew York institutions, San Quentin and otllcrs hsve made it possible for inmates to secure certificates from coulitj-, SC:L~C, and university authorities just as any student in an outside pul~lic school would do. This is an excellent procedure provided the certificate or diploma does not become the inmate's chicf objective. Definite improvement in the social education program will accrue 1)y achirving the best organization of classes possible and the best srlection and organization of teaching materials. Experience has proved this. It is also true, howcver, that the best type of orgsniza- tion possible and excellent materials will have little effect without the type of teacher n-ho will make efficient use of the organization. physical facilities, and teaching materials. Attitudes Rating Charts and Cumulative Records are Used Successfully to Stress Social Competence ;lnnandal~ Farms, J~7alll~ill Prison, lJrcstfield State Farm, Elmira Reformatory, and the ;\\;ex York State Vocational Institution keep rating scales on inmate attitudes. These are marked by each Inem- bcr of tile personnel under ~vhosc supcrvisiorl an i~imste comes. In rrlost of the institutions named, these forms arc marked weekly or ~nonthly, arid the inmate is kept informed of his ratings and tllc rcssons for them. This is an cscellcnt device for stressing the qualities an inn1::te should develop, and for bringing the strengths rind ncakncsscs of each inmate to his attention. Space limitatio11~ prevent the prescntatio~l hcre of these rating plans. The New York State Department of Correction has installed a system of quarterly and final rating forms to be used in each insti- tution. These forms call for ratings on attitudes as well as progress in educational work. A Solution for the Compulsory Education Problem It has been a common traditional procedure in most prisons and reformatories to make attendance in elementary classes compulsory for all inmates who have not reached a certain level of educational nchicvement; for example, all inmates who have not completed the fifth or sixth grade of public school work are compelled to attend rlementary prison classes. In general, experience has indicated that the rigid compulsory attendance plan is not desirable. An inmate, forced into class against his will, usually gains little from such attendance. Education goes on through the efforts of the individual being educated and such effort is not furthered by out- side compulsion. On the other hand a completely voluntary system does not give best results. The Commission on Education in Correctional Institutions in the State of New York sums up the problem as follows: \"The question of whether erirollment should be compulsory or rntirely voluntary is best solved by a cooperative plan whereby a program is worlied out for and with the individual inmate. X fune- tioning classificstion and guidance system helps to solve this jlroblem. This procedure, once established, becomes accepted by inrnntes as a part of the prison program. Thus enrollnlent is neither flatly compulsory nor entirely voluntary in the sense that the man mal\\~~s up his mind alone and without any type of help from any- OIIC.\"~~ Any plan which requires sll inmates who have not reached a cer- tlliri lcvel of school achievenlcnt to attend school should be flcsible e~iough so that if, after a reasonable time, interest and effort can- not Gc secured from an inmatc lie will be released fro111 school until such time as he can be interested. The Social Education Teacher Thc teaclier is alwsys the kc\\-st.one of the educational arch. For many ycars it has bee11 conlnlori pmctice to use inmates ns teachers in most correctiorlal institutions. While this practicc has been clis- 'I i?eporl of the COIIL~~~SS~OIL for the Study of Educnlionnl Problertts of Penal Inalllulions for Youth, Lcglslative Docu~nent No. 71, illbany, X. T., 1937, p. so. 192 Correctional Education Today carded in a few reformatories and prisons, it is still prevalent in most institutions, particularly in adult prisons. In general, thc best thought in the field of correctional education holds that inmates are not satisfactory as teachers, and that the only excuse for using them is that civilian teachers are unavailable. The Commission on Education in Correctional Institutions in the State of Kern york recommended to Governor Lehman in 1935 that inmates be replaced as teachers by civilians as soon as possible. As a result, two civilian teachers have been added to the staff of each of the prisons. However, a large number of inmates are still assisting in the educational program. It would appear that inmates are particularly unsuited to act as teachers in several phases of social education as they have been out- lined in this chapter. In a report of the Division of Education of the New York State Department of Correction to the Commission on Education in Correctional Institutions in the State of New York, the use of inmates as teachers of social education is discussed. After pointing out certain general considerations, such as the lick of education and training which makes it inadvisable to use in- mates as teachers, the report states: \"Since social education and the activities connected therewith aim at the improvement of inmate attitudes and the development oi social insight. IYe are wholly opposed to using inmates in such tt,:tching because even the rare inmatme who might be otherwise prepared for such teaching is likely to make for the accentuation or dcvelopmcnt of wrong attitudes. Moreover, inmates as a group rarely respect the proper social attitudes of another inmate when he has them. They are likely to think that he is a hypocrite or \"fourflusher.\" Psychologically, the situation is comparable to requiring the devil to teach religion. Because of his reputation the devil could not be good at that if he wanted ta.\" In determining the phases of the educational program in which inmates can best be used when it is impossible to employ civilian t.eachers, the report states: \"Inmates are likciy to serve most usefully as teachers (when closely supervist:d) in : 1. Certain advanced academic subjects such :is algebra, foreign Ialiguagcs, typing, shorthand, and other subjects wit,h a minimum of social content; 2. In the so-called tool subjects on the elementary level such 3s twching illiterat,es to read, write, and the use of lrasic arithmetic processes; also such subjects as spelling, penmanship, which (like the three R's) can bc tauglit, even if not best, by placing emphasis upon the acquiring of skills.\" Social Education 193 The report concludes that \"inmates should never be used in teaching such as that which aims to develop: 1. Social insight and appreciation; 2. Psychological or philosophical insight; 3. Personality development.\" Certainly it would be a mistake to place inmates in charge of psychology or personality development classes. It is also difficult to achieve the major aims of the social studies and the general education phases of the social education program through the use of inmate teachers. Nevertheless, many of us are faced with the rltcessity of using inmate teachers. Furthermore, it does not appear likely that we will be able to replace inmate teachers with civilians in the near future. Esperienee has shown that much very good work can be accomplished with inmate teachers, but only when definite training is given them in teaching methods, when frequent teacher meetings are held, when class teaching is fre- quently observed by supervisors, and when careful attention is given to planning the curriculum and to class planning. Care- fully planned materials and procedures, stated specifically and in some detail, are necessary for guiding inmate teachers. A summary of the characteristics which a social studies teacher should possess is given in Chapter X of I~endall's bookL3 Teaching Methods and Procedures ti special chapter of this year book deals with educational nletl~ods and procedures. Throughout this chapter many sug- gcstions as to the teaching methods that should be employed in social education have been made in discussing the organization and content of the various phases of social education. No one method is sufficient. The teacher must have at his command the ability to vary his metliods with the subject matter and t,ype of inmate taught. In general it may be said that the discussion method provides greatest opportunities for achieving the major objectives of social education. On the other hand, the constant change in student personnel in correctional education classes makes neces- sary tile adoption of techniques which enni~lc tile individual to progress at his olvn rate. The individual instruction sheet has to date been the major device for achieving this result. However, n number of other methods and devices are available. Sing Sing Prison, for csnmple, reorganizes its class groups every three months, 'J I<cntlnll, Glcnn >I., The Bureau of Pubhcations, 'rencllcrs College, Columbia University, New York, 1939. 194 Correctional Education Today Social ducatio ion 105 thereby keeping each group at approximately the same stage of achievement. In the use of teaching units it is possible to assign different types of work to members of the class thereby providing for individual differences. The individual instruction sheet has a place in social education but it should be far more than one which calls for written answers to factual questions. The following prin- ciples should guide the preparation of teaching units: A. The material should constantly indicate the application of problems and facts to persons and specific situations. It should answer the question, \"How does this effect me?\" . One cannot depend on the generalized desire for self- improvement on the part of inmates. B. The material must recognize the problems of the day real- istically, but must stress the efforts being made to remedy them and the progress already achieved. Inmates already know considerable about the sordid aspects of society. They know society \"from the bottom up.\" \"Pollyanna\" tactics will not work and \"sermonizing\" or \"moralizingJ1 are equally useless; the materials must emphasize better goals and the way to reach them. C. Group discussions and cooperative activities should be given a large place in these materials. D. In general, the wording, phrasing, and concepts includcd should be within the range of an adult group with a medinn - - - I. Q. of 90. E. The materials should provide plenty of specific work for individuals on all ability levels with varying interests. F. Each sub-problem must be short and complete in itself. It should cover one specific phase of the larger problem. G. Each sub-problem must have definiteness, direction, and be pointed toward specific outcomes. H. Each conclusion reached should lead toward a cumulative concept of our entire social order. Group discussions and group activities based on units organized around definite problems should be emphasized to a much greater dcgree t,han they are at present if the aims of social education arc to be achieved. Certainly entire dependence should not be placed upon the lecture method or upon assigning certain pages to be read in the textbook, or upon assigning certain exercises or drills to bc memorized. The task of the teacher in social education classes consists i11 stimulating inmate interests, suggesting problems, arranging situ- ations which will lead to purposeful activity on the part of pupils, and guiding the learning process which goes on through the efforts of the inmate himself. Summary of Basic Principles Social education in correctional institutions should be guided by the following principles: 1. Social education should emphasize the development of concepts, understandings, insight, and attitudes. 2. Opportunities t,o practice social living should be provided, as well as opportunities for reading about and discussing it. 3. All social education activities should be functional: basccl on inmate interests and needs; and social: based on social problems and situations. 4. Social education should be carefully planned. 5. Definite objectives should be established for social edu- cation activities. 6. All activities and teaching materials used in the social education program should contribute to the desired objcc- t,ives. 7. Teaching materials should be organized around problems rather than as outlines of facts. 8. The social education progranl should strcss group activity and discussion, but at the same time it should provide for individual differences. 9. Social education must use current materials and bc kcpt up to date. 10. The social education r)rogram should be flexible: for - - example, current happenings and situations siiould be capitalized as they occur, even though particular units scheduled must be postponed. 11. Every phase of the educational progrnrn should bt, nn:~lyscd to determine every possible opporturlity for developing desirable social attitudes and habits. 12. The social education program should provide opportunities for the development of initintive, cooperntion, and the ability to make decisions on the basis of intelligent under- standing and responsibility. Ho~vcver, responsii~ility for - lcaclership and guidance always rests with the civilian - - personnel, and any partial delegation of responsibility must he made only when proper use thereof is assured. Correctional education must bring about basic t1esir:tblc c1i:iligc~s in thc attitudes and behavior of inn~ntes if it is to give society a vnlid return on its invcstmcnt.

Briggs Assistant Director in charge of Vocational Education Division of Education New York State Department of Correction William E. Grady Associate Superintendent in charge of Vocational High Schools New York City Oakley Furney Chief, Burcau of Industrial Education New York State Department of Education The Program Must Be Dynamic Any program of vocational education projected within n corrcc- tiorial institution must be formulated not only in terms of the possibilities of the institutional situat.ion but. also in t.erms of act,~lal rmployment conditions as t,hey exist in modern free society. 11-e must give full consideration to present and future economic trends, recent technological developments, the fields of placcmrnt open to cs-convicts and t.he many other variables which will dctrrmiric the success or the failure of our program. \\Vc must hnvt: s pr:ic- tical, functioning plan for vocationnl if the rclcascd irlmate is to adjust himself successfnlly to a free society as n con- tributing member. Vocational education in the in~titut~ionnl sitti- ntion must become an active, constsntly re-adjusting dynamic force leading to the social and of cnch inrnntc. 'I'hc rapid tecl~nological sliifts wit,hin some occupational fields hnve changed a large part of the training content formerly con- ~idcrcd to be 1~11 st,andflrdized. Trades nhich were well (.stnblishcd either bcconle subdivided :t11 cvcr-increasing numb~r of specializrd occupations. Entirely fichlds of employment have come to t,he front 01-crnigt~t. The march of ind~lstrial progress has beer1 both mpid and confusing. ?rIotlcrn research laboratories have created entirely new products nnd processes. Efficiency cngincers have placed vast grotips of umi-skilled workers on line production jobs and at the same time 200 Correctional Education Today Vocational Education 20 1 have created an increasing demand for highly skilled tool and die makers and technicians. Entire groups of workers have been thrown out of enlployment, and at the same time, a scarcity of trained workcrs has been creat'ed in new fields. Xo longer can industrial methods and basic industrial processes he considered static. Vocational educators must be constantly alert to changing needs and future trends in placement opportuni- ties. We must always keep before us the fact that the successful worker must be so prepared that he can adjust himself to the inevit:lble changing demands of the employment situation. This plast,icity of vocational knowledge and skills must he ex- tcildcd to the many \"social\" adjustments necessary within the occupational field. Seldo~n is the \"boss\" the owner of the factory in which the worker labors. In the larger industries \"owner stock- llolders\" may he scattered throughout the nation and the \"main office'' is usnnlly located in a distant city. The individual worker seldom bargains rvitli the indibjdual employer. \"Group bargain- ing\" has bcconle the means of adjusting grievances. For successful living in 311 industrial world, the worker must develop a conlpre- hensi\\~e grasp of the economic and social significance of the remote relationships existing between employer and employee, between capital and labor. AIodern methods have so greatly accelerated output per man hour of labor that production and consumption seldom operate in harmony. \"Overtime\" and \"layoff\" result from t,he \"peaks\" and I{ slumps\" of the economic curve. Our production engineering efficiency has so greatly exceeded our knowledge of distributive economics th:tt a surplus of commodities pile up in our factories \\vhile workers go in want. The ~vorl<ing \"span\" is constantly decreasing. Youths discover that tliey must wait longer and longer periods before they are old cnough to be employed, and men still \"youthful\" find that they arc too old to continue work in tlleir chosen occupations. The Program Must Meet Inmate Needs In spite of tile marly confusing situations csisting in our occupa- tional world, people must work to eat and have a roof over their !wads; othcr~vise t11ey become the wards of society and a burden upon thc taxpayer. Those who arc best prepared vocationally to con~petc in our modern world of production have the best chances of surviving. Certainly any program of vocational training for prison inmates must be based upon conditions as they actually esist in our every day working world. Even more important, full corisideration must be given to the problem of placement limitations surrounding the released inmate when he enters the occupational environment of a free society. It must be remembered that many of our technological shifts have been so recent that an inmate who has been incarcerated for any length of time finds himself facing nn unfamiliar world. It is evident that the released inmate seeking employment must be better prepared than the average worker, if he is to compete successfully for the job and keep employed. Not only must he acquire superior skills at the occupational level for which he has the capacity, but he must also have that related information mhich makes him a plastic, adaptable, thinking worker. \"Successful rehabilitation demands that the released prisoner be equipped to earn a living in a manner acceptable to a free society. This involves a program of training leading to the development of tangible and marketable vocational skills which will enable him to exchange his labor for a sufficient wage to live with reasonable c0rnf0rt.'~l Throughout the t.raining process an intensive effort must be made to develop desirable at,titudes toward useful work. Skills must be accompanied by concepts of pride in a job well done. This is not impossible of nccomplishment. Note the pride of the average inmate in some litt.le product which he may have been allorved to create of his own volition. The trinket box constructed of burned matches seems an accomplishment; labor that is forced seems an undesirable task. The inmate's mental att,itude is greatly influenced by those supervising his work. An inmate in one inst.itution who hated the job of cleaning halls eventually became an cnt~husiastic writer of instruction shects on the vocation of \"Janitorial Service.\" There is a \"kick\" to be gained from recognized accomplishment, the ability to do a job bet,t,er thnn the other fello~\\,, and the possession of a background of technical informat,iori which gives a concept of t,he ''why\" as \\\\-ell ns the \"how.\" A11 of tlicse mental attitudes tend to replace less socially desirable reactions to environ- ment. 'Report of the Coinmission jor the Stc~dy of the Etlucntwnal Problems of Pennl Institutions for Youth, Legislytivc Document No. 71, Albany, S. Y. 1937. p. 73. 202 Correctional Education Today Training which results in purely habitual reactions to a working situation is not sufficient. Related technical information is essential to a sound understanding of the job and to the making of the necessary and constant adjustments to new situations brought about by modern inventions and technological changes. The need for flexibility in the application of acquired skills to technological changes does not mean that it is inadvisable to teach them through a specific trade. The equipment of any standard machine shop involves all of the operations and principles included in the most complicated specialized production machine. The important factor is to teach those operations and principles thor- oughly. With a specific trade as an interest center there is hardly any limit to the broadness of the background that can be developed around it. TSTe must prepare the inmate to face this complicated, industri- alized world with a background of training that will enable him to sell his services successfully and adapt himself to his environment. He must either be equipped to become a producing social asset or in- evitably, he nrill become a social liability. The program of vocs- tional education adopted for the correctional institution must therefore meet the training needs of each individual inmate in terms of both his capacities and his interest. The Program Must be in Terms of Individual Capacities It is evident that the lower the skills demanded by any occupa- tion, the greater the number of individuals who are prepared to take the job, and the greater the labor turnover at this level. It is further evident that many inmates are limited by native capacity to jobs of this calibre. It, therefore, seems logical that those of limited capacit,y should be trained on lower levels of achievetilent in a variety of occupations, thus extending their employability range. We may designate this as \"horizontal\" training. \"Although innumerable occupations now exist for which industry can train recruits in a, few days, a few weeks, or in a few months, many of the oldest trades still exist and new skilled trades steadily appcar as tlle result of scientific research and invention. As long ns America rcmains a nation of buildcrs, it mill continue to need many highly skilled mechanics and ~raftsmen.\"~ Vocational Education 203 Individuals with greater capacities should be trained intensively to a highcr degree of skill in some specific vocation. We may con- sider this as \"vertical training.\" Both forms are possible and desirable in the institutional situation.

There is little evidence that any well-organized, functioning programs of vocational training have been in esistence over any considerable period of time. The term vocational education has been applied to ever?-thing from hard repetitive labor to corres- spondence courses ~II no way connected with the inmate's past or current vocational esperiences. .-is nil1 be indicated later in this chapter, vocational education in its modern sense must be a thoroughly integrated, well organized, purposeful process. Certain Techniques May be Utilized in Developing the Vocational Program KO program of vocstional training within the institution can be effectively operated without the cooperation of the entire institu- iional personnel. One of the first steps in organizing a program is that of familiariz- ing rile staff, from the warden or superintendent down to the last ~uard, with the oi~jectives of the program. The \"status quo\" is frequently \"holy writ\" in many institutions. There is always the frar that any change may stir up the sleeping spectre of inmate t 11;-moil. He who would modernize any prison educational program niust first prove that such a program will assist the staff in operating the institution more efficiently. The next logical step is a survey of the inmate group to determine the ranges of mental capacities, previous occupational experiences, types of crime, placement opportunities of the localities to which they will be released, and similar data essential to the determina- tion of a desirable vocational training program. Once we have determined the content of a desirable program of vocational train- ing we are faced with the problem of available facilities in the way of time, space, personnel, and equipment. Every institution requires a certain percentage of inmate time for mnintrnnnce nrcds. This varies grcatly according to the im- rnedi3tc nccds of the situation. A new institution may have ronsidcrable grading to be done; another has a large farm. It is \\v(.i1 to know at the start how much inmate time is really available for the educational program. Some of the maintenance work is scnsonal. This will influence the distribution of the time avnilablc for training. Again, some of the maintcnance work may be utilized for training purposes, and some may have little or no educational No successful program can be developed until the tinic factor is well analyzed; otherwise, the program of training will be in continual conflict with maintenance requirements and subject to constant interruptions. The need of space for training purposes is a vital one. Some institutions have well planned school and shop buildings. Others have unused space which may be adapted to training purposes. Esisting maintenance or industrial shops may frequently become trnining centers by the addition of a few arm chairs and a black- Imnrd. These should be made available for demonstrations and rclnted vocational class groups. Such classes should be scheduled nt periods which will not conflict with institutional organization or production needs. A classroom may be partitioned off at the end of a shop, or a section of a basement or corridor may be adapted for training purposes. Funds available for educational purposes in the institution are uuunlly limited. It therefore becomes imperative, before promoting n vocational education program, that a careful study be made of tile institutional floor plans and some long range planning, as to nvnilable space, be undertaken. Where a vocational school plant 1)rcomes possible, it is recommended that the building be such that ndcquate light, good ventilation, and above all flesibility of con- struction be provided. Partitions should be movable in order to meet the inevitable changes in space requirements which will follolv. No satisfactory educational program can be accomplished with- out an adequately trained personnel. A vocational director or ~upcrvisor is essential to a smoothly functioning program. If funds are not available for the employment of such an officer, some e~nployce who is truly interested in the development of a vocational program should be givcn the authority and rcsponsibility for its r~rornotion. In any case, the man given such responsibility should 1~ f:~~niliar with the techniques of vocational education procedures. if ti~is is impossible, training should be acquired after he is assigned to tlic job. He should also have a background of trade esperience \\rhicl~ will gain the rcspcct of the various t*eachers and tradesmen rvith nliom he must work. It is usually desirable to secure turo types of trades teachers. First, thc sliilled craftsmarl wlio teaches the trade skills and informa- specifically related to those slcills and, second, thc rclated 208 Correctiolzal Education Today Vocational Education 209 subjects teacher who teaches the trade blueprint reading, drafting, mathematics, estimating, and the general science basic to a com- prehensive grasp of the trade processes. Kell trained vocational teachers should be employed wherever possible. A state-issued vocational teachers certificate is desirable. In many cases, due to limited funds, it is necessary to utilize guards in charge of various maintenance or industrial activities. In this case a course of vocational teacher training is essential. It is sometin~es possible to secure the cooperation of the vocational education division of the state university or of the state educational clepartment in conducting vocational teacher training classes. The assigning of a qualified guard to a teaching position need not of necessity increase the operating cost of an institution. A carefull\\- orgnnized schedule may result in as many men in training li~ider the custody of a guard as would be the case if the men Kere breaking rock under the same guard's supervision. The sanle sitiiation is possible if the inmates are under the instruction of a ~vell trained teacher. In some situations, due to limited funds and a lack of civilian personnel, it has been found necessary to utilize inmates as teachers. The first difficulty is that of securing sliilled tradesmen from among the prison population. The second is that we must consider other iit:il factor> ill appointing inmates to teaching positions; for es- ample, s~!ch elements as emotional instability; sex perversions; internal group stresses (cliques and gangs); the proverbial prison fcnr of 'lsti~king one's neck out;\" the prison-wise concept of keeping one's mouth shut; the racket organizer; the rapist; and many other factors xhich limit the selection of inmate teachers. In receiving prisons, where a careful selection is possible, inmate instructors nho are adequately prepared have proven to be ~atis- f:~ctory and have developed some excellent programs. -4 program ~f 1-ocational teacher training is necessary for inmate instructors if teaching efficiency is to be achieved. This has been accomplished in Se\\\\ k'orli State through the preparation of a handbook by the State Department of Correction, covering the best methods and ~~rocctiurcs for conducting a vocation:tl training program. The issuing of this handbook was followed by group teacher training sion on conferences vith the inmate staff and individual supcrvi ' the job. Summarizing, a functioning program of vocational training requires a trained tesching personnel. It is preferable to employ trained teachers. If this is not possible, guards and employees .skilled in a vocation may be utilized and trained upon the job. As third and least desirable alternative, inmates with previous voca- tional experiences may be selected and trained in service. The matter of equipment is of vital importance. Existing main- tenance and industrial equipment should be used wherever possible. C~lfortunately, the activities in all vocational fields within a prison scsldom cover the range of vocational activities found in the outside world. This means that equipment must be augmented by addi- tional units until a range of experiences is made available which will be adequate for a well rounded vocational training program. \\Vhere adequate funds are not available there are frequently n:iys of expanding a program with the minimum outlay. In one institution where a course in refrigeration maintenance and air- conditioning was desired, a fund of one hundred dollars purchased four used electric refrigeration units. With t,his start, through the (lonutions of various manufacturers, a well equipped shop is now in operation including an air-conditioning unit built by the inmates. Certain Techniques Are Essential to the Organization of the Teaching Process One of the first steps in the determination of the teaching content of nny trade is a trade analysis. A trade a!lnIysis is simply a detcr- rninntion of the trade operations and related infornlation fncts tvi~ich a worker must know to be proficient in that vocation. It 1)ccon~cs the teacher's guide of what he must teach. Illustration I shows a part of an analysis of the automotive mechanics' trade.4 ,\\lost trades hare been rather well analyzed by federal, state, nr~d city vocational education departmcnts. Copies of these mtLy .sometimes be secured and save collsidcrable time in preparing an nn:ilysis for the institution. One of the chief advantages in having nli instructor make his own analysis is that lie must think through l~is s~~bject in logical teaching steps. 1:oIlowing the anal)-sis it bcconlcs desirable to dcvclop organized it~struction Most individuals learn :tt different mtes.

Physical Education and Recreation 223 CHAPTER XI PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND RECREATION by John Law Physical and Recreational Director Rroodbourne Institution for Defective Delinquents Woodbourne, New York L. W. Davis Second Assist,ant Superintendent in charge of Physical Education and Recreation Kailk~ll Prison, Wallkill, Xew York I \\ Gerald Curtin Acting Director of Recreation Sin- Sing Prison 0ssin%lK, Serv York Recreation is a growing force in the rehabilitative treatment of ri~ir:ls. It nls introduced in Illany institutioris with sornetlling of a 'tongue in the cheek' attitude. Some prisons have adopted the practice of permitting recreational activities as a short-cut to the solution of disciplinary problems. In others, physical education has bcconle a measure for improving the general healti1 of inmates. But tliesc are not the most important purposes of physical ed~rcation :rnd recreation in correctional institutions. Physical education and recreation serve most usefully TI-hen correlated witli the whole prison program and when regarded as a necessary part of constructive treatment. The need for recreation has always existed but the recognition of that need mas left to the individual discretion of the prison administrator urltil recent improvement of educatio~ial pro- grams pa.)-ed the way for a more enlightened point of view relative to the airns and methods of recreation in correctional treatment. 1Iany uf those sentenced to prison have had, at the least, a liniitcd nrnount of cducatiori and industrial training, but the extent of tiirir rrerentio~inl training has been greatly rritrietcd. Usually, wl13tever training they have had has been so limitcd that it hns Imd but little effect in equipping ttiern properly for successf~ll living. Some j)risuners slloi~ definite interests arid aptitudes but no coordination of purpose. Man)- are crnotio~~nlly 11.lrt-Sle. Very few have any al~ility to use their leisure tinic constructively. Rrrrcntion in the prison must contribute toward emotional stabil- ity nnd provide a compelling incentive for developing proper social nttitudes. The education of any individual is incomplete if it has been nllolly concentrated upon one phase of his development. When Ilc spoke at a meeting of the Regional Recreation Association, Dr. \\\\'nltcr M. Wallack, Director of Education in the ?Sew York State 1)cpnrtment of Correction, told the assembly: \"Tllcrc is a very close relationship between education and recrea- I. In fact, in my opinion, they are inseparable because recreation i.s education-t least a type or form of education. It is important to integrate all types or forms of education, that is, all educational nctivities. We set up standards of perfection for our educational ~o:~ls nnd while we are working to~vards tllese we aim toward a rirl~le purpose, the all around development of the whole individual. '1'11(1 cnd product of the integrated educational program is, we hope, the integrating personality. Unless one is an integrating pcrson- nlity he cannot bc wholly useful and as a result is not likely to know t11r contentrllent and peace of mind that come fronl being a useful pnrt of his group, wherein cooperation is the main force.'' S:~ttlrally, these principles apply to the education of the man in priso~i just as they do to the man in free society. That is why ~~!~ysicnl education and recreation should be an integral part of the rcl!nl)ilitativc program in any institution. General Aims and Objectives of Physical Education, and Recreation in a Correctional Institution f'liysical education establishes a means of participntion in activi- tirs tliat prornote health, muscular sldlls and \\~cneficial attitudes. It develops proper habits of physical and mental alertness and rc..spollse, awareness of body frinctions and purposes, and an inter- crct in general n ell-being. Physical education provides an outlet for cr~rrgics that supl~ression ~vould turn into undesir:~ble channels. xnture has crcatccl the h~lmnn being witli certain faculties as well as the nlcans for making use of them.

Bar bell work, or weight-lift- ing is somet,imes frowned upon due to s popular misconcept,iorl of its value. So mucll of it has been done without proper supervision nr~(l training that there has probably been more abuse than con- structive use of the bar bells. Lifting weigh wit.hout a thorough understanding of muscular refleses and the proper application of tcnsion places a st,rain on vital organs that may cause permanent tfnmngc. Instruction should be given only by an instructor with R t2rorougll knon-ledge of correct procedures and classes should be aut~jcct to constant supervision.

One of the s.ims of physical education in the institution is the maintenance of normal functions. It has still great,cr significance when used as correctional treat<ment for men who, on t,he whole, have given little time or thought to their physical welfare. In general, the recreation program may serve to t'cach and en- coumge the devclopmcnt of proper social habits and the right use of leisure t,ixne. JIany valuable lessons in cooperation, respect for aut,l~orit,y, and regard for the rights of others can be an outcome of proper recreational activities. They can bring out and develop Intent, qualities of courage and sportsmanship and contribute to the subordination of personal interests to those of the group.

There are greater possibilities for cresting an underst,a~iding of fair-play and responsibility in the group as vie11 as in t.he individual by part,icipat,ion in games and other forms of recreation than may be found in the customary classroom pro- cedure. Expected Outcomes of the Physical Education and Recreation Promam - \\\\That physical education can do for the man in prison is impor- tant but what. it does for him after his release is the ultimate reason for its c~istclice. There can be no denying the fact that poor hcalth nnd faulty pliysical de~relopment reduce the parolee's remaining employed. Pllysicnl edu- cation, by prcpnricg each inmate for parole, gives hinl a bettcr chance in the ficld of honest competition. In turn, this will tend to lo~ver thc percentage of parole violations for ~vhich uxlcrnplo~.- ability is often the cause. Ath!ctics and sports have value as recreation and as physicnl cduca!ion. They high-light the program and are at1 crfective of cnsuring spontaneous participatiorl by large numbers and makr ior continuity of intcrcst. Team play applics the of physical education to organizcd sports and translates them into conscious endeavor to succeed through physical strength and nc- ~~uircd ability. Team games teach a man to think quickly and iniprove his judgment of situations. They develop character arid n xnsc of responsibility.

Soflball is a good subst,itute for baseball where the recreation yard is too cmnlped for the harder-hitting game. It is a particularly good game for the lcss active inmate. Due to its wide popularity in communities a11 ovcr the country, there is a sound argument in fnvor of softball as preparation for future leisure activity. Foothall is the sport best calculsted to bring out the qualitics that, it is desirable to encourage in readjusting inmate personalities. It is necessarily limited to a comparatively youthful group, but tllc young offender has greater possibilities for responding t,o corrcctivc influences. Foot,i~all is the most highly organized of a11 t,eam games. So other sport demands t,he same degree of discipline, the same drgrec of coopcrtltive effort as does the game of football.

There has rcsultcd marked evidence of increased receptivity and p(~rs01ia1 re:itIjustment on the part of inmates who cngage in this sport. Conduct records of the population at large ill institutio~ls lsl~rre foot.1~111 is played show a definite improve~nent in behavior.

Horseshoe pitching and bocci boll foster interrst in personal skill. The i~lclusion of sports of tliis t,>-pc is i~nportant in rounding out the program so that it will rcach rvt'ry inmate no matter 1%-hat his capacities or interests. Tlle question of compulsory milittrry training is debatable. In rcfurinatories it nlay be a definite factor for good. The rigorous tr:lining it involvt's supplies the disciplinary element whose lack is vile of the reasons for youthful cornmittments. Pl~ysically and psycliologically it creates 3 response to the neglcct,ed qualities of nl.)edicnce and respect for authority. For this reason, nlilitar?.. trfliliing may have great valrrc for mentally deficient inmstcs who lcnrn best through repetition. As regards an older population, or inniates of average or better than average i~itellige~lce, it rnay i)c good disciplinary treatment but the fact of con~pulsio~l wor1;s against the success of corlstructive outcomes and the ultirnste good itlnt comes from spontaneous effort rather than from enforced routines. Iloxvever, the fact remains that in the gsrnc of lifc IlrrI~its of action based upon delil~crate judgment and rrasoninq nrc more important than those which come from automatic response. \\\\'cckly clnsses in hygiene can help tie up the physical education profiram with health education.

In bringing in teams from nearby communit.ies, we approsimat,e as nearly as possible future recrkational activities. Visit,ing teams are int,erested in booking games and they, too, receive a stimulus toward a better appreciation of penal objectives t,hrough this agency. Participation in social ganzes with instruction as to rules and techniques centers interest on wholesome forms of diversion and carries on t.he socializing process. The formation of leagues in the more popular ganles makes for their widespread popularity. Pirig Pang hss become a particularly well liked pastime in institutions and has fine physical as well as recreational values. The formation of clubs and a hobby shop for the pronlotion of special aptitudes should be included in every recreat,ional program. Instruction in crauork develops special skills and has creat,ivc values for maladjusted personalities. It is occupational therapy in a modified form and releases pent,-up energies through constructive projects.

Tnridernzy is instructive and like marly avocational pursuits hns dtfinite vocatioxlnl possibilities. Certain branches of art can bc encouraged through club unit,s. Sketching, modeling, painting and allied subjects afford a means of self-expression as well as of acquiring tetrlinical information. Jlztsic has emotional appeal and frequently evokes a responsive . attitude on the part of men who fail to react to other stimuli. Pro- vision should be made for training and practice in orchestra and ba?zrl work under a trained civilian leader. When an inmat,e shones talent and is given an opportunity to develop his technique, therc is a possibilit,y of his entering the musical field professionally when paroled. Itccords slioiv instances where this. direct rehabilit,ation hns t:iken place. The band and orchestra should be given an upportanity to play in concerts, at ~ntert~ainments and at at,hletic contests. Glce clzlb work and comn~unify singitig offer means of musical expression to t,hose who are uninterested in instrumentation but. \\vho may dcrive similar benefits from choral exercises. Dratnatics should come under the supervision of a trained coach if it is to be msdc really worth~vhile. Its immediate value lies in the deveIopmerit of poise and memory habits while the technical training in st.agecraft, scenery design, make-up and lighting may result in pcrrnanerlt hobby or voc3tional pursuit,^. The staging of amateur theatricals is good diversion and provides entertainment for the inmate body on special occasions. In almost any institution r]lcrc is a plentiflil supply of singing, dancing and comedy talent. lfinstrels, musical shows and variety programs can be produced at [rrclucnt intervals. At Jvallkill monthly amateur shows are featurctl n hilc Elmira Reformatory has had a regular weekly broadcast of innintc talent over the local radio station. Entertainment has a considerable place in recreation. It is a nlrnns of release from the mental disturbances of prolonged con- finc~ncnt. Motion pictures are shown in practically every institu- tion in the country. They provide the emotional relaxation that i~ rrowhere more snlutary than in institutional life. Radio is instruc- tive nnd entertaining and is another means of rlormalizing life for the inmate and of instituting normal mental preoccupations. .\\l:tny prisons have radio outlets in each cell and selected broadcasts nrr rclnyed to the population. Regular use of the auditorium for lrrlurcs and talks by men in various fields is of special import:tnce, ~~firticulnrly when followed by a forum conducted by the speaker K) thnt therc may be free discussion of the subject. JVhethcr the acltirrss is of a practical or purely inspirational nature, these talks nrr stimulating to some proportion of the inmate body, resulting in nunkcning new interests or creating the desire for achievenient. licnding is as much a form of recreation as any of the other nrtii.itic.s sponsored by that department. The prison library should 11rcessible at stated periods for personal selection of books. ('Iloosin~: a hook from a list of those available will not encourage rrrrcling hnbits nearly as effectively as browsing among the shelves.

Ways and Means of Organizing and Conducting Activities . I . llc pcsriod of time for individual pnrticipstion in the physicnl dl~cntion nnd recreation program varies according to thc extent. of irltillstry, rducntionnl and vocational work provided. KO prison mt~linr should be so inflesible as to offer a serious drawback in the alll~r:ltion of sufficient periods of time, space or funds for effective work in physical education nrld recreation. Ccrtnin hours each rc.*k ehould be set aside for required participation in the physical 232 Correciional Education Today Physical Education and Recreation 233 education program. Designation of groups, comprising men who work in the shops or on other institutional assignment,^, to hours regilIarly sclicdulcd simplifies administration. Frcc time or frce play activities are carried on after the shops are closed, during the evening hours and on week-ends. In almost every institution shop and school, work is shut don-11 over the weck- end period. It is during this time nrit,h its let-down from daily I-out.inc of ~vcrl; t!iat chafes most at the restrictive forces nro~~nd Iiim. Often the men are locked up or allowed mi!! aim- lessly :iround the yard. Idleness breeds disconte~lt and trouble. Certainly there is nothing in its favor as administrative policy or rchahilit,ntive treat,nlent. The physical education and recreation program can utilize tliese leisure periods as punctuation marks for its nc~c~kly essays on tlie theory of building better me11 from within as \\;-ell as without. They afford an opportunity to climax the daily irist,ructiorl and training with the stimulating punch of competition. X good program c~i take advantage of every rnoment of the tveck- cnd holiday. This is the time to schedule the playing off of lenguc gamcs, the presentation of bosing cards, tournaments in minor .:port,s and socinl games, broadcasts of outside sporting events, featured entertainments, gymnastic eshibitions, and especially com- petition with outside teams. >Tan>- ins~itutioss lock up in accordance with the hours of dcy- light thus climiruting the possiblity of evening recreation. In certain instances there is no other alternative since many oi the oldcr and larger prisons have only the central auditorium or chapel in vhich the men can congregate. Even under these circumstances, Ilon,ever, quitc an extensive program can be arranged to cut do\\\\n n~atcrially the prolonged period of confin6ment in cells. Entertain- ~nent fcat,ures that include the population as,an audience, such 33 motion pictures, radio programs, ~nusical events, sho~vs and lectures cnn br sclicduled for several nights of the week. Institutions wit11 dormitory iiousiiig and those provided with recreation rooms ad- joining cell bloclis pcrlnit the effective introduction of it should be 1ool;ed upon as an essentin1 part of the \\\\-hole program and activities regulated and directed with the s:lmc objectives 3s the daytime proccdures. Perhaps t,hc first stcp in the orga~iization of a recreational progrnm is the establisl~rncrlt of a mcdiunl of contact with the population as 3 \\vhole. The sirnplcst and best means of direct conlmullicatioll is n t~ullctin board set up in the place most accessible to a11 inmates, t~.sl~nlly the recreation yard or mess hall. Here announcements of t11c formation of leagues, of coming events,-in short, all news from the director, should be posted. If outside competition is permitted, an institutional tcam is chosen from candidates displaying markcd ability. But this takes care of only n small percentage of the men who can and ~~ish to takc part in the more popular activities. To stimulate interest and providc in- crcnscd participation, leagues may be formed among the different stlops and cell blocks. The winning team in a league may be given nn opportunity to play the institutional team and an all-stxr team mny rllso be chosen from the league players to compete against the institutional or an outside t'eam. Perhaps the ideal arrangement for mnnaging teams is to have officers act in this capacity eince this clirninatcs many difficulties. At t,he same time it incre~scs tlie inter- mt of the personnel in the program through active participation in its various projects. Anot'her alternative is the appointment of a pnrticulnrly able inmnt,e in t'he cell block or shop to select and man- ngc rr team. Or an older non-player nzy be chosen to manage tcxms n.hosc members may be drawn freely from different dep:lrtnients. for sornewhst greater congeniality mlong t'lie players. Il111rs nnd regulations may be drawn up at a meeting of the nun- ngrr.9, wit,h, of course, the approval of the director. qucstion worthy of discussion with rcspcet to t,he organizntion of lllc physical education and recreation program is that conccrn- inu rniscd participation by colored and n-hite men. It is possihIe to cnrry out separate and dist,inct prograIils, but set,t,ing up racial hnrricrs is poor policy. Men must be tolerant in or out, of prison. ftmrntion in prison is an effective instrunlent for inculc:~ting the er'irit of tolrrance. It offers tlic broadest field for prnc,tical npplica- tion principles n l)oy of 'JI~~Y by the players, but by the entire populatio~i ns \\\\-ell. 234 Correctional Education Today Physical Education and Recreation 235 Discrimination against nationality or creed should be handled in the same way since this is another form of intolerance often en- countered in institutional life. JT%le the foregoing discussion concerns problems in organizntion peculiar to correctional institutions, much of the procedure fol- lowed can be conducted along the same lines as physical education and recreation in schools and colleges. The Personnel Required for Physical Education and Recreation The question of personnel is a vital one. Upon the ability and personality of the director hinges the success or failure of a progrnm. Technical trninirig in athletics and recreational is indispcns- able. Silice the director will work with a group that does not esactly constitute a school-boy element, size and appeamnce are an impor- tant considerntion. Many inmates are fairly shrewd individunlu, quick to detect any weakness in those in authority, so that integrity, good judgment, firmness and fearlessness are essential to secure co- operation and to command the respect of t.he population. Good o~~tside contacts are a 7-aluable asset. Wholesome temperaincnt and disposition, emotional stability, tact, self-confidence and R- sourcef~il~iees are qualities of personality and character that slio~ld be considered in selecting a director of recreation. He should also have a knowledge and understanding of the conditions and environ- ment from which the criminal comes. He must, in a way, be able to 'speak the same language' so that be ~vill be qualified to inspire confidence and give counsel. Above all, he must have a firm belief that through his work he can help the men under his instruction. E~ithueiasm is contagious and the man who has faith in what he is doing has a far greater possibility of sweeping disinterested inmntcs into the current of activity and of getting positive results, than tile one who is only half convinced that what he is doing is north~vhilc. The :lumber of assistants to a recreational director depends on the size of the population and the amount of time given over to the program. Diversification of activities and a high percentage of participation c:lrinot be attni11~~1 if con~plete re~~onsibility for su:~ervision falls on the shoulders of the director alone. With large population tlie program must be sy~lchronized so that sevcrni divisions are sirnu1tanc.ously cngagcd in various activities. Usunlly the budget is unequal to the task of providing special civilian assis- tants but the assignment of guards with specialized talents and interests is perhaps even more desirable. Care should I)c taken to ~'lcct oficers whose personal influence will be wholesome and con- structive, men who can be depended upon for guidance as \\re11 as in.struction. Loyalty to the director is an important qualification for the guard assistant to eliminate the possibility of disruptive infl~lr~ices and to make for a united effort towards the common outcomc. Officers working on the evening shift can contribute amntly to the success of evening recreation. JYhile the director is rwl)onsiblc for the organization of evening activitics, assistants arc ncccsnry for their operation. These men should have good social cl~nrnctcristics and special qualifications for creating interest and giving instruction in hobbies, games, crafts and arts. 'I'llc proper selection of inmate assistants has an importoilt bear- in^ on tlic snlooth functioning of s program. An innlate with train- ing n~id experience can assist the director in teachin the techniques of liis pnrticular line of activity. Care and distribution of crwip- n~c.rrt should be delegated to inmate assista~lts. d little rity ill selecting those n-ho are considered 'right guys' is n big stcp in rlirninnting petty difficulties and avoiding big ones. There are ol\\riiys ccrtain men who follolv the code of inmate bchavior so inl~)liritly that they are looked upon with respect by thcir fclloivs. ,411 inmate so chosen is sometimes able to act as arbiter in situntions lflllt ~lcctl adjustn~erlt, reporting dissatisfaction and provocatioris irt tl~cir early stages that might not otherwise come to tilr nttcntion 01 tilt oficcr in charge. Nore often than not, since their ju~lgmclits \"m llcicl ill rcspect, they ore able to bring about undcritnnrling and =(x)r)cmtion ~:.ithout necessitating any intervention on the part of ttw director. ?KC Physical Provisions for Physical Education and Recreation Programs . 111~ , i)llysicnl characteristics of an institiltion t I 23G Correctional Ed~~cation Today Physical Education and Recreation 237 Indoor Physical Activity While a regulation gyinnasiunl is tlie ideal set-up for this branch of the program, there should at least be a space of sufficient dimen- sions to include a standard basketball court and two handball courts. There should be a dressing room with 1ocl;ers and sho~vers adjacent to the central hall. Equipment should include: at least, two baskct- ball ~t~andards, one bosing ring, one wrestling mat, parallel bars, horizontal bar, bar bells, one volley ball standard, and paraphcr- nalia to meet the needs of the population. Outdoor Physical Activity There should be one large main recreation field with sufficient room to permit lay-outs of: one main baseball diamond and n utility diamond for either baseball or softball; football, in season; a circular track for special events and as a place for the inmates to i~dulgc in walking for health, four or more handball courts, six liorscshoe pits, two bocci ball alleys, and 2.n outdoor basketball court,. Additional fields, while not essential, are highly desirsblc for universal activity. Wherever possible there should be 312 indoor or outdoor swimming pool. Ball equipment and othcr paraphernalia should be provided to accommodate all participants. Recreation In addition to the provisions listed for physical education activi- tits, arrangcmcnts should be made for bleacllers, both indoors arid out, to allow for spectatorship by the population at compctitivc games. It is important that the auditorium comfortably accorn- modatt the entire roster of inmates for lectures, motion pictures and other entertainment. A large stage, equipped with footlights, drops, and dressing roonls is necessary. For free time activities, special rooms shol11d be provided for social congregation, for C~U~IY and pariicu1:trly for a hobby shop. Games. art accessories and craft materials should be made available for general use. Necessity for Research and Records in Evaluating Outcomes So so~ind judgment of results deriving from the institutio~ifi! physicctl education and recrcatioil programs car1 be made \\vitho~lt n method of exsluating outcomes. It can be do11c b). 3. systcnl of rcsc,arch :!nd records based upon institutional behavior of the indi- xidual nlid his actions in society upon release. In the first place, preliminary research must be made to dcter- nlirlc the needs of the inmate so that his participation nay be Jircctcd along lines best adapted to accomplishing the desired otltcomcs of good health, mental adjustment and ~vholesome leisure i!rtcrests. A composite picture must be obtained of past environ- n~c>nt and conduct, present person:~lity and character, and possible future activities. Thus it is possible to est,ablish that course of nr~ioll which has the greatest likelihood of encouraging natural nl,:i!udcs and eliminating undesirable traits. Routine observa- tions should be made of physical condition and the attitude of the intlividual in many situations to determine improved trends in con- d~rt, ability and interests. Investigation of habits, attitudes, and Irirurc interests of the inmate when at liberty in his own com- r:lrlrlity would make research s conclusive means for evaluating ti;c ultimate outcomes of institutional physical education and xrrcntional objectives. Itrsrnrch, of itself, is valueless unless a continuous rccord of Entlings and arcomplishmcnts is maintained. All informntion that is vf value to the recreational director should be obtaincd from the it~rnntc on his comnlitment and entered on an individual rccord !ilj.tl in the recreation office. In the course of confinernerlt regular rnrricbs on this record will show whether inlprovenlrnt is being m:tcle xrtl to what estent adjust~rlcnt has taken plsce. In case of tr~ns- Irr from one prison to another such records help to contiquc the t*.ncfits already in progress. ,411 the information thus recortlecl is tlrrnulative evidence of what physical education and recreation 1.n~~ nccomplisl~ed. It is only after research has been conducted ond the records used and studied that an evaluation of the cspectrd c~ulcornes of health, acquired sliills, improved habits and attitudes, ~rltl eventual good citizenship can be made. Critique of Present Programs it critical survey of physical education and recreation in correc- tionnl institutions revcals 011lj. scaiterctl instances of whnt may he trnllcd the itleal program. There arc nitlespread variations ns to the extent and diversity of activities sclieduled, supervision, and allocn- lion of funds for a rccreatiorinl department. In m:my cnsrs, thcrc i* little or no attempt made to the pcriod of 'frcc tinlc' or 'yard time' xvhich varies from three hours per '%ccl.c to as much ns forty hours a week for the inmate. Tl~e nlcn arc generally 238 Correctional Education Today Physical Education and Recreation 239 held in one large yard in order to maintain maximum custody with a minimum force of custodial officers. In some institutions thcrc is semi-organization of leisure time, when more or less qualified employees are assigned to supervise activities. On the other hand, many prisons nov employ a trained director and the physical edu- cation and recreation program is regarded as part of rehabilitativc treatment. One of the reasons for the lack of supervised recreation is adminis- trative resistance due to the failure of the administrator to undcr- stand the purposes of physical education and recreation. hlnny administrators regard their duties as purely custodial. Those who do admit tlie necessity for corrective treatment are often unwilling to go so far as to admit that recreation has any important values. Such preconceived opinions must be changed by convincing argu- ments and proofs of the psychological and physiological changcs broi~gllt about by inmate participation in recreational activities. -1Iany institutions are handicapped in recreational work by luck of funds for this purpose. State appropriations are limited at I)est , alitl arc oftc~i u~~cqual to the demands set forth as minimum rcquirc- rnc.rlts for conduct,ing a program. Certain expenses are variable and discretionary but definite expenditures must be made. Pul)lic opinion is the chief barrier to increased appropriations. hIost recrcatiorlal activities are somewhat 'soft-pedaled' out of respect for the tax-payer's lack of understanding of the correctional pro\\)- lem. The right kind of publicizing would, however, correct marly existing errors of opinion as to the importance of recreation in cor- rectional institutions. Budgetary purse strings cannot be loosencd without the approval of those who contribute to public funds, and their approval cannot be obtained unless the importance of recrca- tion bccomcs a matter of general informatios. These, in addition to incompetent administration, appear to be the factors most widely responsible for the great discrepancies in recreational programs. Once they are overcome s more concerted approach to the ideal in the adnunistration of physical education and recreatiuri car1 be made in the rriajority uf institutio~l~. Integration and Correlation of Physical Education and Recrea- tion with Administration and Other Elements in the Program Xo one division of a rehabilitative program is complete within itself for the reclaiming of an individual. Every phase of routine, vocational and academic training, prison industry and physical rdocntion and recreation must be integrated in order that the aims and objectives of each may contribute to the common outcome,- tllc rchnbilitation of the individual. An important educational ol)jcctive is the teaching of good work habits since, regardless of mccl~anical skills, an individual who does not have good work hn1)its can never be wholly successful. Health and emotional ntnlility contribute to the formation of these habits. This csem- plifics the interdependence of two of the divisions of the whole rccorlstructive program. Morever, the balacce of man's waking tlorlru are devoted to work and to leisure time and the proper use of the one may be invalidated by improper use of the other. hd- ministrative forces must create and provide for recreational activi- tic.9 ill an educational sense so that the inmate is as well adapted to vocational pursuits as he is equipped by vocational training to prartico his trade. Trends in the Development of Recreation and Physical Education in Correctional Institutions \\Vliile physical educatioll and recreation programs in correctional inhtitutions are still somewhat in the process of evolution, the Illore ndv~iriccd programs arc an indication of the vital part such activities arcs l~cxgin~iing to take in rehabilitative treatment. More and more rn~l~llnsis is being placed on the importance of recreation as a neces- anry 1~:irt of educational tmining in free society. This tendency will u~~tlo~ibtedly be retlected in i~istitutiorlal circles through a wider and nlorcL rapid recognition of the valuable outcomes of recreation as s part of institutional routine. . . I llcre is a trend towards a more central organization of those crlnn~ed in ndministering rccreatio~lal programs that will mal\\-e Lhr c.omrnon esperierice available to every institutional recreation worker so that the dissemirlatio~l of ideas and espcricnces can go 1vond the specific institution or localized educational program. -1 8tc.1) in this direction was made by the organiz~tion of the Rcgional I{cc.rct:ltion Association of Correctional Institutions, with member- 8hi1) from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut correctional 240 Correctional Education Today institutions. During the annual three day conference, methods are discussed, views exchanged and committees named for the investigation of important problems. The extension of such an association into a national organization would do much to increase the scope and efficiency of institution4 recreation. Internal orgnnization, within the state, night be centralized through the creation of the post of supervisor of recreation. Pro- grams at present are left very much to the discretion and impetus of the director in each institution, with a resultant inequality of administration and achievement. Greater uniformity of action and accomplishment could be secured through the services of n supervising director trained in this work and with \\vide experience in prison recreation. The necessity for physical education and recreation in correc- tional institutions can no longer be disregarded or ignored, because these activities satisfy a fundamental urge of human nature. The arguments in favor of institutional recreation form a compcllir,g force that r;il! eventually override the obstacles impeding the general adoption of this tool in rehabilitative treatment. Xo tool in corrcctiond nork is more worthy of continued effort for improvc- ment, more deser~ing of being perfected to fit its purpose. It rests vith the prison authorities to ensure that proper and effective use is made of this means for aiding the inmate to overcome the liabili- ties of his o~o shortcomings. CHAPTER XI1 SPECIAL TYPES OF EDUCATION by Russell A.

Since- t,hese individunls usually are markedly emotionally unstable and meet to emotional butbursts, special education must be directed- -- . at this focal point. A guarded environnient seems most appropiate for its operation and it seems necessary to conduct it on a thera- -- put,ic bnsis. In IEniiiT a'specinl cell- block is set aside for this purpose and in it ii compIEFe educational .- system functions. The person -- -- in .. cx?rge of the education of the emotionally unstable sl~ould 11avc special training in psychotherapy and occupat~ional t,hempy. uha.=\\i_e_~-mor\"mporta~lt, he must be emotio~lally stable himself and possessed of those personil qualities which will- \" - make him an inspiring leader and guide of disturbed personalit,ics. The right person can achieve remarkable results; the wrong person will not only be in actual danger himself, but mill create s situation where the safety of other persons and the institution itself nlay he jeopardized. The core of this propm is predominantly activity. Each indiriclual carries his own program and conscientious efforts arc . . - made to escludc situations for ally one individual in which he prc- = .._ viouslv had been unsuccessful. The activities are varied, including art. metai-lvork, hand and machine tl~e field of ,ge!leral education. - Each individual's program is predicated upon prekjh~~s_~llcce~ful riperiences and amplified in accordance Gitrhis abilitr, ~ccrck - tion also plays an import,ant part in this program.

It - should notlw nssunied that these activities are csrriedon t,oservc t,he traditional prison management-to &s$, to oEcupy thcir time, to kccp their minds occupied, to ll~lp -. them do their time \"straight.\" If these outcomes result, it is only in&tlcntal. The emphasis is on the individual. While no ernpllasis on the achievement of standards of accomplishment are openly rrvcnlcd to the inmate, individual achievement, in final analysis, is the measure of the degree to which this special education is functioning. This block in Elmira has only fifty-five rooms. About twenty- five percent of the total populat.ion of sixteen hundred are psychia- tric:illy classified as psychopathic. Only the extreme cases can be ~wrigncd to the special class. The turnover in this population of fifty-fix is suprisingly large. That they do satisfactorily take their plncc in the general population after participatior~ in this special educational program is some evidence that desired objectives are twing si~ccessfully attained. It is also evidence -~ that the educaJiona1 - - program as a whole is being adjusted to individ6al needs. - - Special Education for the . Illiterate and ~ackw&d :. , , , : I -- - . I. .

Because be is in tbc minority he is usually given little attention and oftentimes dis- nlissed from consideratio11 as hopeless, or not worth the time and cfTort it ~vould take to improve him. This is especially true !\\it11 the mentnlly deficient. 11-hile funds for correctional education nrr nut essy to get for any type of inmate, general public opinion seem to be that it is entirely out of the question to attempt to do any- thing with thc feeble-minded. As a matter of fact, very littlc rcsearcir has been done in the field of the defective and hsndicapptd delinqurnt and criminal. An institutipn which will carry on careful espcrimentation ~ith these special types of inmates will render n very definite colitribution to the field of correctional education.

It should be said, hon-ever, that progressive public librarisns themselves arc anske to the fsilings and deficiencies of their Iibmry i~uildings and their library procedures. They are becoming in- crcnsingly aware of the stern necessity of actively seeking the f,lnds, with the assistance of federal aid, to provide reading centers and book collections, both in the country and tlic city.

Since this chapter should deter- rninc tllc educational function of the library, it might be necessary lo provc the librarian's contention that reading for pIeasure and ~II~C recreation also has its educational aspects. Probably no one ~ould deny that the history incidentally absorbed while reading a s~tisfying novel, that the knowledge of another country, race or Airid of person presented in vivid story form, is a worth while and cil~lcntional feature of such reading. Such knowledge, although orily indirectly and even unconsciously taken in by the reader, con- ~rit~utcs no little, in the sum total of many such reading experiences, to one's fund of general information. The conscious choice of rapid- pnrcd, romantic, sentiment or completely diverting fiction, to ease etrnin nnd tension and relax nlental and physical muscles, is evi- drnce of intelligence and education of a kind. Nor should the purely wlnxing properties of rcading be denied. It is not necessary to ir~~prove one's mind and purposefully choose every chapter of one's rrncling. Only when a reader persists in making his mind a \"drain for [~rint\" and insists upon continuously using his read in^ hours for \"r.rcnprl' purposes only, a harmful sidestepping of the world hc nust live in, can recreational reading be considered harmful. It is probably unnecessary to point out the aid of the library to rhc tvnrdcn in many matters of prison disciplinc, also. 11-hen eve- rlinr: nnd meek-end hours are devoted in part to reading, there is rntrcll less opport~init~y for boredonl and idle mischief to develop, murh lc~s prcocclipation with petty grievances, much less dwelling on rclrl or fancied u7rongs.

Many times the librarian may suggest some of this I~IH: of reading to the prisoner himself-to help him see hinlself, 0; sonleone in his fanlily or his job in an objective fashion.

Since 1930, the American Prison Association Committee on Educ:ttion hns included the library in its list of interests, and schedules FP.fikers and discussions on the library in its programs. Austin ~lficCormick, in his survey, \"The Education of Adult Prisoners,\" included an inspiring chapter on the possibilities of library service in n prison. The American Library Association has sponsored a ('o~nmittec on Institution Libraries for a number of years and this ('oninlittee has been responsible for the preparation arid distribu- tion of the Prison Library Handbook, a practical guide to the mrch~nics of running a prison library. It has also sponsored the i~n.p:irntion and distribution of 2500 Boolis for the Prisora Library, rc~~c~thcr with the appearance of two brief supplcment,s. It also ~aitiatcd a survey of prison library conditions in this country. At its 1938 conference, the Amcrican Prison Association p:~ssed a rr~ol~rtion in favor of prison libraries and established, for tlre first tr!ncb, n Committee to guide their developnlent. !In additicn to ~)rt-l)nring an extensive list of recent books for prisorl libmry use which will be ready for early future distribution, this Committee 1s coopcrating with the American Library =Issociation Comniittce tn n~r~kirlg a re-survey of prison libraries which will be avnilnble, IS i3 rxpccted, at the 1939 American Prison Associati011 Co~lgress. 1~ ivill then be known, accurately, where libraries are located within prisons, what place the library has in prison buclgets, who cr~ln*rviscs the library, what per cent of the inmate population uses tt. l~orv many books t-here are, how many prisoners can go to their I~l~rnries, where guided reading is done, how lnany trained librarians rhcrc are and other pertinent facts which will complete the present ~~ri.v)r~ library picture.

They believe that in most instances thc ~varcicn wishes a library in his prison and that he recognizes tlic value of its nsciztance in his efforts to effect a change for the bcttct in the lives of his prisoners. Thcy trust he will not over-estimate tlic difficnlt.ies of introducing and estending a service which aiti:r ali brings 3s nlsny returns for the investiment expended as anyoric can expect of any educational agency.

Four years ago, San Quentin celebrated the tvcntieth anniversary of the founding of correspondence education witilin that institution. It is possible that other institutions developed some form of corm spondrncc stucly even earlier. In this one instance, however, tt!c program has been carried on for a period of twenty-four years 3::J is constantly improving. Thousands of men during this time havc enrolled in University Extension courses alone. Most American prisons carry on correspondence and cell-study courses to some extent. JIore than half of the prisons reporting in the first two issues of Correcizonal Edzccation promoted such programs. Prisons nliich have carefully climirlated or nlinimizcd inherent disadvantages of this type of educational program report a con- tinuous rise in enrollment. At Riker's Island Penitentiary in Kca York City, a new high was reached in hlay 1939 when 955 mcn mere enrolled in one or more cell-study courses and 1168 enrollcd in the various subjects. Tlle Federal Reformatory at El Reno, Ol~lalior~la reports that ten percent of the population took corrc- spondc11c.e couroes even though the inmates had to pay for thcm. .iril)t:rn State Prison in Sew York reports that cell-study education enrollcd the large>t number of inmatcs to the n~ngazine, in cell-study courvs in the State Penitentiary at i\\lcnsrd, Illinois increased during the current year whereas school attendance dc- crenscd. 111 the last ten years there has been a definite trend from cor- F51~)ll~]cnce to classroom inst,ruct'ion. This is due in part, to t,hc Inrrrnsing number of men under confinement and the necessity of firltlirlg tasks to prevent idleness in prisons, However, the most imp,rtnnt factor is the increased use of civilian teachers. Of twelve in.rtitutions rcporting the absence of cell-study and correspondence ~~~rlfics and describing the educational personnel, in t'he first issnc of (:orrcctional Educntion (1037), nine are staffed largely by civilian rrnrtlclrs. Of the eleven institutions offt:ring cell-study or corrc- cp~ndrnce courses and describing the educational personnel, nine rtrqro st-nffed predominately or ent'irely by inmate teachers. class- ttwlrn instruction has, moreover, many advantages over cell-study, particularly for certain types of persons and in the teaching of rul~jcvts in which social concept,^ and at'titudes are paramount. ('1:tssroorn instruction is essential in the case of illiterates. In spit'e of tt~is trend towards class instruct,ion, correspondence and cell- rt111ly continue to be recognized as essential parts of most correc- !:or~:ri programs. %me Expert Opinion on the Use and Value of Correspondence Study .\\Ire IIoward L.

Lessons are mailed to thc :~gcr,:.y for correction tvliich in turn sends back the less011 shcct.9 togctlier with comments, and the student then proceeds to the succ~cding lesson. Cell-Study differs in one or two ways. The courscs may be bought from outside agencies and the lessons graded within the prison itself, or t,he-courses may be drawn up within the prison and the lessons graded within the institution as well. Cor- rrS~pontlcl~icc and cell-study work may lose in ef1ective11ess bcc3usr: contact, sympat,hetic fro111 thch Then, too, the of group activity, from tlie personal rclationshir)% :Inlong st~itI(,~~is feeling of approvd b!' tl~c grnllp are 1:icliing in, dcnce 2nd p:lrticul:ir :llso, the long hiatus bet\\vcen the colll- plction of a 11~s';oli and the receipt of the corrected answers frorn the outside ngc!ncy is ps~.~!rologically harmful to the individual's drive toward cont.i~iucd lcar~ii[ig. One advantage of correspondence and cell-stndy courscs is that bccause tlicty fccl it tntcrfer~s with their work are made accessible to the educational Jcpnrtmcnt.

Nost courses are very bookish and seem to be written by mrn. frequently teachers, who have a picture of students, usually juvcnil~, in classroom formation. Correspondence and cell-study courm writ,tcn as though the student is in a class are undesirable. A succ~ ful tcarher in a c1:tssroom uses types of stimuli and resorts to devicctr ~vhich cannot be used under correspondcnce or cell-study conditions. Care should be given to the selection of syllnbi so thnt the matcrid is presented in an attractive and compelling form. In checking o\\.cf correspondence courses in non-institutional situations, we find drastic ch:tngss 1i:lve been made in recent years. For example, the Army correspondence course system has made marked impro\\.c- mcnt. It was formerly the practice to issue an infornlationd parnplilet and a svrics of questions. The student had only to rcsd the pan~phlet to find vsrbati~n answers to the questions asked. The Army 113s cllangcd tliis system, and no\\t7 almost all the corrcspoud- encc courscs use tlle problem and project method. / Correspondence and Cell-Study Education 287 Increasingly, prisons are beginning to write their own courses nt1:~ptcd specifically for a particular type of student. Of the sisty ~~11-study courscs offered by the state penitentiaries in Illinois, all but four have been prepared by inmate teachers. In a prison, correspondcnce courses should stimulate the inmate to performance of some task as evidence of his interest and to dcrnonstrizte his grasp of the subject. In view of this, we should uw increasingly the problem and project method. Xecessarily, ~>roblcms presented to such men should be problems similar to I~IOSC the inmate will meet after release. Furthermore, many men intcrestcd in prison education contend that successful outcomes nlr~st be possible, for \"nothing succeeds lilie succcss.\" Part of tlle rr.l~:il)ilitative process is the clcvelopment of feelings of sclf-con- fidt-ncc and belief in one's ability. The correspondence and ccll- rrtudy courses enable the individual to demonstrate to himself that hc l~ns ability and can achieve definite tasks. School Texts too Juvenile for Adults 'I'lic problem of test books accompanying correspondcnce and ca-11-study courses has presented a great many difficulties. Most tcxt i~ooks written for elementary or high school use are unsuitable for nlcn since problems for adults should be couched in terms of the rorkirlg world existing on tllc outsidc. During the past fen years $:\\I! Qucntin has developed what they call the Prc-Vocatio11:ti I.:cltlrntional System including such groups of subjects ns Prc- I*:ngiliccring, Pre-Farming, Pre-Commercial and Pre-Electrical cvr1rsc.s. Even though they are teaching the elementary concepts of riritllmctic, the student sees more meaning and value in corre- bting the subject matter nith his chosen vocntion. llany prison #-hools have dispensed wit11 books altogether and have urittcn t~ll:ll)i to overconle juvenile text difficulties.

CHAPTER XV INSTITUTIONAL MAINTENANCE WORK AND INDUSTRIES AS EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES by Richard A. McGee* TVardcn, Xen- York City Penitentiary Johrl Dewey said, \"Jve learn by doing.\" 11 (10~s not necessarily follow ho~ve~-er, that by \"doing\" we learn anything of social or economic value. Prison inmates recjuired to mop the same floor day after clay or to sit in idleness listening to rJ~e obscene boastings of their companions or nstcl~ing the im- pndcr:~blc doings of a cockroach are no doubt learning, but the outcomes of that learning are of doubtful value either to tlicrn- rxlvrs or to society. Tllere is a multiplicity of necessary tasks ~hich must be performed by the innlatcs of any penal or corrcc- tiun:ll institution. These tasks i~hether they be in connection nith routine nlaintenance activities or ~vitti the manufacturing industries src lisually determined on a purely utilitarian basis. It will, thcre- !ore, 11e impossible even under the nlost careful organization to turn all of these activities to specific educational ends.

Iic first st,op in list \\\\ill perforcc %wll(l upon the size and ii:~t.urc of the inst.itiltiun. 235 Correctional Education Today Institutional Maintenance Work 299 Follonring the preparation of this general list each shop or actirjrr should be considered individually. It will be found in most inshoho that each activity can be divided into a number of separate ;d categories. For example, the work in conilection with the p&r shop might conceivably include maintenance painting of buildinp, furniture finishing, automobile finisling and sign painting. A thorough knowledge of any one of these dilisions of the painter'* trade should give a man a wage earning asset. If each other majw dil-ision of the work program is broken down into its trade ditisj- in a similar manner a long list of trades or vocations will thus lr dc\\-eloped. Froni tlie educational standpoint the nest logical step is to ndc a conlplete trade analysis of each occupation or trade represent&. To do so at this point would hou-ever, be a great waste of time and energy since many of the trades so listed will probably not be typird oi the trade as it exists outside the institution. And others, HIJL fairly typical of the conditions existing in the trade may prc4n.r \\-cry limited employment opportunities. For example, to ~JP training in tlie trades invoked in a prison textile mill in the State of Sorth Dakota would have little vocational value becausc SOPA Dakota is riot a state in which employment in textile mills is like:! to be obtainable. Or training in a broom shop is probably rnthci futile anywhere because this industry as it exists today is hi~i~!) iileolianized arid oversupplied nit11 experienced workers. Or ngia to consider that waiting on the table in a typical prison mess ha9 may be considered vocational training as a waiter is ridiculous b~ cause the conditions of this work, are so different from those esistiss in tile typical hotel or restaurant that such experience v;ould pmt al11y be a handicap rather thzn an asset from the vocational stsnb. point o\\\\iilg to the forniatioii of poor work habits. .Iliotlicr type of negative factor appears in training for (31-3 Service appointments, accounting and similar nork bccauw A prison rccord nil1 usually greatly reduce the probabilitiy of oL~A~s. irig crnploymcnt where these skills can be used. Ccrtaiii otlier trade activities may have to be eliminated for tr:tining purposes because rilodern equipincnt, nlncliincs and :uid tlle opportunities for their use within the institution nrc lg-~ llicagcr to have coni~ncrcial significance. For example, a niachir~c shop cqui1,pcd with a few hand tools, an antiqtlnted lathe rind a drill press prcselits little or 110 facility for training in the numcruu divisions of the macliinist's trade. - Other skilled activities which would normally present good yos- $l,ilitics for vocational training may have to be eliminated because of ~pccial conditions incident to the safe operation of the institutiorl. L!nder certain conditions a modern power plant might have to be rlinlinated from the list of training opportunities because of the danger that unskilled or possibly unscrupulous workers might d.?mnge thc equipment and machinery either from ignorance or through malicious intent. An institution depending upon its l~ower i~lnnt for heat, light, power and water supply cannot afford to take chnnecs in this way. ~rsde' Analyses Essential \\i'llen the list of trades and activities has finally been reduced to irlclutie only those in wliicli tlie possibilities for training are real, frwible, safe, and typical the next step is to niake a complete tr:tde annlysis of each vocation. Such an analysis, simply stated, consists of nri invcntory of the operations, typical jobs arid related inforrna- tion wllich constitute the vocation. The second step in tlic annlysis :a to arrange the operations, typical jobs and related information into iristructional order. That is, these fundamental units of the rwntion should be listed in groups, each group successively rcprc- wnting higher levels of learning difficulty. The techriiques of annlyses as a basis for curriculum constrriction should bc well undcrstood by any n~ll t,raincd vocational cducatiun cspert, and am thoroughly discussed and described in the standard literature d this field. There are numerous trade analyses in published form rlrich Jilay be ohtained for t.he asking. These nnalyscs will in crarly all cases require somc revision to fit the partic~:lar conditions CJ[ 11 given institution. However, they will he found of incstirnn1,le unlllc both for the purposes of rcvisio~i and as a guide for 111nki11g Crx n~lalyscs.

I3 otlicr words, each mall should be given only those tests which miaf,t possibly reveal some special vocational ability or disability whirk is not already apparent.

At the conclusion of the vocatio~lnl offirvr'r rr,port a brief statement should be made of the idenl disposition d t,hc case froni t'he standpoint of vocational adjustment. The fsri tiiat this idenl may not be attainable due to practical limitations d the i~istitution's facilities, or to prohibitory costs, or to local atlnlin. istr~itivt policies should not be talien into consideration in dc5cri!r i::g the idtxal disposition of the case. Following t,hc ideal stntcml,n: should 1)e n practical recommendation which, though in mnn? instnnccs ma>- not be ideal, \\\\,ill nevertheless be as near tlir icir-A! as possiblc arid at the same time be feasible and pmctical~le. Tliis specific recommendation of the vocational officer sliould r:r,t be regarded as final in any sense, but should be given considcm~inc :it. a mcctiilg of the classification board in connection wit!] all of I!.? other information concerning the individual. It may be t,hat thtz will be other considerat,ions, such as medical treatment or disci~)lin- ary restrictions, which will make it impossible in the judgment tlie board to carry out any part of the recommendation. Hon.c\\.cr. even though t!ie vocational officer may be aware of tlicse facts in adv:ince this should not dcter him from making his recomrnenda- tions on the basis of a need for vocational training. dcgrce of error. But nevertheless the best judgment possible should ~nnde because the pllrpose of vocational training of prisoners is fu~idnmentally to assist them to make a satisfactory social and ctononiic adjustment after release from the institution. There call 1~ little point in giving vocational training to an individual who in 311 robab ability -.ill not make legitimate use of the skills and kno5vl- ctlgc acquired. For example, to offer a vocational course in acety- knc ~relding to a man who has a long background of burglaries and nllo sccms to have ingrained anti-social attitudes might have exactly the opposite effect from the one desired. The Inmate's Ability to Pro-fit by the Trairzi~zg Tllc most cornnlon crror made in selecting courses of vocational trnil~ing either in prison or in free society is to overlook or misjudgc tile innate capacities of the student. It is liseless to give musical training to n person who is tone-deaf; to give training in auto a~ccli:~nics to one ~vhose nlanipulative ability is far bclorv is estremely poor. r\\iiotIicr commo:l error in this connection is to assume that skilled trntlrs such as carpentry, electrical work, tool making, stationary enp,illccring, plumbing and so forth can be mastered by feeble- zni~ltlcd or border line intellects. The probability of succesa in a aLillrcl craft is very lo~v for any person whose general intelligence trr much below average.

Even then their success will be limited to nianipulative work under clircction of a rnnstcr craftsman capable of doing the planning, conlputing, and lay out work.

The experience and information TYC have gained during ~1st fen- years indicate that we must cn~ploy t,he same form d c:~rning and the sallie devices and materials that the trainre ~sc after he is actively engaged in farming. If n-e exanline the activities and means by m-hich tlic farm kil~\\~ledge of his business \\\\-e can evnluatc i& ~rocedure and devices necessary and suitable to the tractiiq lf farming.

If we hope to get effective individual participation carried out by the trainee there must be X)me tangible pattern in which to work, growing out of class in- stn~ction that will guide. practice. I'crliaps the greatest weaknesses in carrying on farm practices in group instruction are: (1) The size of the job is riot large enough to 3:1kc n real work situation for a large group, (2) the equiprncnt is inndcqu3te and inappropriate to employ properly the eriergies of rt~c entire group, (3) the work is too often poorly planned and tii;cctccl. Group instruction should be attempted on a farm pmc- rIcc bnsis only wlren normal conditions of the job are approsirnated. thir of the most important materials or devices neccss:lry to effec- tive teaching is the 'result or progress chart' wliich is both a measure ~i the t,rainee1s progress and a yardstick of the teacher's :tccom- t ii4mcnt.

A sensible selection of material, when combined participation in the making of daily decisions in connection with ttlc operation of the model farm, should result in satisfactory progress in developing managerial ability. The operative aspects of the managerial jobs present quite ,z different and a more complex problem. It has been stated that thc*re are more than two thousand major operations connected B-ith farming. This fact mal<cs it perfectly evident that it mould n.sult only in confusion and failure to attempt to train a particular irlnlate in operations not entjrely essential to the type or localized fnrmiiig in which he is interested and in which he intends to make tlis livelihood. This situation can be hantlled by the charting of tllc various operations and kcepirig a record of accomplishments for cacll inmate, scheduling his handling of the operations applicable to his objective so as to avoid unnecessary repetition or loss of time RII~~ cncrgy. Certain of the farm practices, being those dealing with biological, chrmical, or physical ideas and principles can be c:trried out under .school or classroom conditions for economy of timc. This is the drmonstration method and in this connection it is well to remember t11:lt the demonstration must culminate in the 'doing' in order to be cffcctive. This necessit:ttes a laboratory and n farm shop, but ngniri it is to be borne in mind that the use of the laboratory and fnrm shop and the equipment rcquircd by each will be determined in large part by the method of teaching employed and the more ~ocationalized the teaching the less equipment necessary. In selecting laboratory equipment we should be guided by the ~jrcds of the special exercises which mill be employed in teaching the far111 problems and not by stand:trd lists of scientific cquiprncnt. I.ikcwisc the farm shop should revolve largcly about farrn repairs, such as the care and repair of harness, the c:ue and repair of farm mnchinery, and tllc care and repair of farm buildings. The f:~rm sflop sliould be simply a place to tcach the trnince how to perforrn efficiently and economically those rcpnir and construction jobs tlmt arise in carrying on tllc local typcs of fnrining. This should not prrscnt a problem since most prisons ~ilnintnin vocational shop courses in masonry, carpentry, clcctricity, and plumbing and the content of these courses applicable to farnling, can easily be made nvi~ilable to the farrn group. The materials and devices for the effective teaching of vocationnl agriculture arc neither complicated nor unusual. Insofar as possible they should be the same tools arid equipment as are used by the 324 Correctional Edtication Today more successful farmers in the locality in the operation of ttpb farms. It is the organization and efficient use of those mstc6s!o and devices that need our attention.

The educational director and the physician can work together effectively in selection of the content and materials of instruction. Tentatively such education might treat of such subjects as venereal disease, the care of the eyes and teeth, proper diet, clothing and esercise habits, personal and community sanita- tion, and general safety education. Instruction sheets, containing a short, lucid summary of the essential facts, along wit11 a short answer test should be valuable. Abundant printed materinl on health can be procured from the state and local health authorities, tllc American Red Cross, Life Extension Institute, The United Stntes Public Health Service, and many insurance companies. Since the cluestion of venereal diseases is such a vital subject today, the pamphlet, \"The Venereal Diseases\" by Thurman B. Rice, RI. D., published for twenty-five cents by the American Alcdical Association, and \"Syphilis, The Nest Plague to Go,\" by 1'Iorriss Fishbein, 34.

The best illaterial on industrial safety and industrial health can be obtained by having a membership in the rimerican Safety Council, 108 East Ohio Street, Chicago, Illinois. Such visual aids as models, eshibits and charts are, indeed, essential to a vitalized program within the class room. This more or less - formal instructiori in class should not preclude the use of lectures, dcmonstmtions, health films nnd slides, health eshibits, posters plnccd throughout the institution, and the use of the institution publication as a means of health education.

For the nlcrt teacher working in the institutional ficld, they serve to enrich and vitalize his content and presentation. Current institutional training programs lag pathetically behind accept,ed procedures and prnctices of modern education. A very effective means of stepping up the tempo can be found in exploring the many courses of live cducntionnl matcrials now available and adapting them to particuInr institutional needs.

Determining the Size of the Building and the Type of Construction IVhatever t8he size of the building, the type of architecture and const,ruction should be such that the school ~i~ill posscss t,he digrrity in nppearance which n school unit deserves. It should bc so plnnncd :md so constructed that it will stand apart from drab surroundings, radiate hope, stimulate s dcsirc to seize opportunities flouted iil fornlcr ycnrs, and inspire a reoricrit,atioil of thinking, a revitalizcd scnsc of values, 2nd a decent regard for the ~velfarc aid happiness of all mankind. Factors Which Should Determine the Size of a S'chool Unit The following factors must be considered in dctcrrnining the ?izc of the school u~~it; (1) t11c presciit pop~~lat~iol~ at the institution, (2) the (luring the nest, tcn yenra, (3) thc nnd provision for ~~oe~il~lc Ir~turc changes in educational (5) the n-hick1 arc t'o be cxried on in thc tlir: size of t!w site, (7) tile funtfs nvailn!:le for constructing thc building, 2nd (S) the effect on educational enrollnlcnt of increasing nurnl~ers of irllc inmntcs due to loss of prison i1ldust:ics.

Tile school oiFcrs one solutio~l for this problem of iillcnc~ss. X school space provided for tllc greatest riumbcr of hours daily. 342 Correctional Education Today Material Provisions 343 In determining the activities to be included in the educsti& program, the educational needs of the men confined must b c- fully considered. In institutions where a high percentage of iuitct. ncy prevails, a different problem is presented from that ivhicb faces the educator in an institution in which the pre-institutior,d edilcational acco~ilplishnlents of the inmate body are mucll hightr. In every institution, illiterates and the few men whose backgrouEd enables them to carry college work are housed side by side. Tilrrt educational problcms are different and yet vital to cach mn. Bct~veen these extremes is the mass of inmates, each with diffcrrnl education31 needs and each presenting a problem to challcngc th prison administration and the educational director. Certain educational needs are dependent upon the vocational opportunities 31 ailable in the state. All states have a few occup- tions and vocatio1131 activities in common. Plumbers, electricianfi, printers, and the like are employed cvery~vhere. Hoivcver, tlrr need for agricultural training in Tesas is far greater than thrit ir. llassachusetts, and training for the automobile industry in JIirtli- gan is s greater problem than it is in Sevada. Ksturally, tliw institutions nhose inmates will return to the rural areas fncc nn cntirely different type of correctional training problem from thw institutions nit11 a predominantly metropolitan population. I1 tile educntion:~l s:;>tenl of a penal institution is to serve its inmntca to the best advantage, the future occupation of the inmates mu:: be given important consideration in planning the educational build- ing. The age of the inmate body must be considered before the building program can be determined upon. In reformatories tvh~rc many of the inmates are of high school age and may entcr Iii~h school or college n hen released, the problem of suitable buildinp for scllool use is difycrent from that facing institutions which hou* o!clcr mcc. Sou- and then 3 man leaves prison, enters collcgc, fir:lduntcs, and nqsumes an honorable position in his chosen pro- fession. Thebe isolated cases will become more and more the com- rnon occurrerlce niien the prison provides tile opportunity for young men to accornplisli this desirable achievement. Provision should be made for the educational needs of this group, and evcrj' effort should be made to increase the number of inmates in it. Material Provisions for Types of Educational Activities The foregoing factors, presenting problems for each institution to solve for itself, make esnct recommendations for a building program an impossibility. Hon~ever, a brief discussion of general building needs will be presented based on the types of educational activities which are considered essential in any modern correctional education program. At least nine types of educational activities must be considered worthy of space in the correctional school building. The space and importslice given each mu~t vary as thc needs and purposes of the school in one institution differ from those in another. Material provisions should be made for the following educntional activities: Academic or general education, con~mercial education, agricultural training, vocational or trade training, radio and entertainment, music, the library, handicrafts nnd hobbies, recreation and physical education. Provisions jor Academic or Gcnernt Ed~~cat~on The space assigned to academic instruction should be divided into classrooms nith a maximum capacity of tnenty men. Class- rooms of this size will compel the school ztfministration to n-orl; nith small groups. This is an es~cntial procedure in adult ec1uc~- tion in order to encourage more efficient instruction through per- sonal work on the part of the teacher. In this department, as in all cthers, the lower three and n half or four feet of the n alls along the corridors may be constructed of the same material used in the partitions. nut 3t this approsinlate hcight, the next three or four feet, or even within :L fen inches of the ceiling, should be of glass. such ~01istr1ictio11 assures the menns for closc roorrl nithout thr dis- traction caused by supervisors and custodial inspectors opening and closing the classroom doors. All rooms uscd as classroon~s or for any type of instruction purposes should be eqaippcd nit11 ample blackboard and bulletin bonrd space. Practically all the inside partitiorls should be utilized in this manner. The blackboards should be of high quality mnterial, preferably blacli slate in dull finish, and so fised to the ~vall that little or no glare is reflected from them. The constant use made of the blackboards requires that students be spared unnecessary eye 344 Correctional Education Today Material Provisions 345 strain which so often results when an inferior substance, 1rs.sly placed on the wall, is provided in an attempt to reduce tr~ and thereby achie\\re economy. The question of furniture for the classroon~s throughout rb entire building is a perplexing one. TO date, little attentin\" hee~i given to the equipment llceds of a school constructrd fcr adults. Even in many colleges, the furniture presents the splti?. ance of adaptation of kindergarten and grade scliool cquil,rr!rn:. csctpt for laboratory fur~iiture and shop equipment and arr;lr.,-h. ~nent, little may be copied from our institutions of highcr I~nrriir.~ Thc psychological advantage of nvoiding make-shift ap1)c:inr.c.. of thc furniture in the prison scliool is evident to anyone f:im,lr~t wit11 the inmate mind. The prison school is a school for 8duf'~ who hnve been thrust into an abnornlal environment, and nl3r.r of nliorn were prot~lcm czses in former school situations. '1-1:- fnctor~ nus st be uppernlost in planning the educational builtl:nar and no opportniiity for positive stimulation should be disrcg:injn! I'rob?.b!?- chzirs and tnbles provide the most 1ogic:il t~ p dL' furniture for the classrooms. In the grades of the acadern~c drp3rt- rncilt, individ~~nl tables or tables to accomrnodate 110 Inore t1:~: tno students are desirable, although some institutions favor tnlb!- acconl~nodating as many as six students. In the high school scrtiur. and irk otller units of the school, larger tables may be employed I~J adva~itnge. The chairs and tables should not be fised to the Hwr. tl~ey sllould be movable to provide for quick rearrangement b xncet the class situation and to assure thorough cleaning of tfr room by the porter staff. 1In1ly institutions have on the staff skilled workmen able lo desizn and construct suitable classroom tables. The design and c.onstructiori can then be varied to equip each unit of the SC~M:! with distinctive furniture possessing the essential features to con. for111 to tlic necds of that department. It is suggested, 11on.cscr. that the tops of a11 tables be covered with green 1)attlcship Ill]* Icuni. This project in irhicb sllor~ld corrclztc closcly with the work of tlic prison school fillti. if properly motivated, furnislics the basis for creating loyalty the scliool and cncouragi~ig 3 sense of communal ownership, tilllq inspiring the irl1n2te body to spcal; and think of OUR SCHOOL Ciiairs arc nlorc difficult and ]nor(! costly to provide nithin (110 institution unIcis some one of the state industries is equipped to ~nanufacturc chairs on a production basis. Classroom chairs S~OU]~ conform with the style of the tables, but strength and utility must not be sacrificed for t,he sake of appearance. Specifications should be carefully det,ermined to serve as a measure in selecting chairs regularly stoclied by a dealer or as a guide in the manufacture of a special chair. lIThcther the construction is of metal or wood, t,hc chairs must be sturdy, well-balanced thro~~ghout, and cornfortnble. Sothing is gained in the long run by sacrificing quality for price in tllc original purchase of the supply of chairs. In considering school furniture, it might be well to give some sttention and thought to a chair with desk attached. TVhere this typc of equipment is deemed adequat,e, tlie nced for tables is eliminated; yet it is doubtful if the combination chair and desk is suitable for use throughout the entire school system. TJ711ether they should be placed in recitation rooms only or whether they should be avoided entirely is a question each school must decide for itself. There is lit& to be said in fnror of the old typc school desks. These rcflcct too much of t,he \"kid-stuff\" to appeal to any ndult. Even though a supply of these clesks may be had from puldic schools for the taking, their use is unnise economy. An adequate supply of maps, charts, globes, and all ot.her accepted instruction devices is desirable. As far as possible, thcsc sliorlld be availnble to the classrooms at all times; a series of charts relating to highway intersect.ior~s is more valuable in :t civics classroom than in the supply room even t,hor~gh t,hcsct rooms are adjacent. What,ever mat'erials of this type are provided, tlicy should be up-to-date, for nothing is more discouraging to a tcacller than attempting to present material which he l;no~vs has long been outmoded. In purchasing t,hese teaching accessories, only t.hose it,crns ~vhoee value is known and ~liose use in t,hc classroom is ass~~red should secured. A11 others will rcprcscnt an espcndit,ure of money which can be ut,ilizecI to grentcr advantage in othcr phases of school \\vorl.;. Special care niust, be cscrciscd in t,he field \\vllcii mat,crinl of t,lle s:lmc t'cnciiing value may bc donntc refcrcnce b001is occupying vnlu:~blc shelf sp:lce. Pol)- 346 Correctional Education Today Material Provisions 347 lishers supply books at the usual discount to the tmde; libnr& and public schools, for transportation charges. True econoat demands that all books be of the lat,est edition at the time of ncqd. sition and that the books be cared for in a manner to mnkc th- serve their purpose for the longest possible time. Donated boot may be acquircd without much espense, but, as a general pdb, they are of little value in tlie classroom. Advanced students in any department of the school may supplied with adequate materials from tlie high school and collrut lists of accredit,ed publishers. For the beginner, the mnn who ir learning to read and write and figure, textbooks and tcnctrinr nlat,erials are a serious problem. At the present time, little rnntcriel is offcred by publishers for the adult beginner. Juvenile mstcrid is not satisfactor:-. Nere the challenge is to prison educnton; they must pool their resources and develop a type of literature which provides the necessary vocabulary drills in material with an ndrjlt intercst and appeal. A few institutions have acco~iiplislicd corn- mendable success along this line. The contributions of thrw institutions silould be made available to all the prisons of th country. Provisions for Co~nmercial Edz~cation The amount of space allotted to the conimercial st,udies ~vill b determi:lcd, of course, by the needs of the inmates, and those of tk institution. The need for trained clerical personnel from the inn~~te body in those institutions which house a large population will mfike a commercial school desirable. If the potential enrollment in the comrnercial school is sufficient to warrant a varied and co~nplclc cornmcrcial course, then adequate space should be allotted for the work, and modern equipment installed for i~lstruction purposes. The classrooms of this department cannot be of uniform sizr. but the space must be determined by the activity to be assigncd to each room. The shorthand and typewritng rooms should adjacent with a glass partition to malie possible niore convenicnl supervision. The ideal arrangement could be obtained with two small rooms for sliorthand, one on either side of the larger room assigned for t,ype~vriting. The typcrvriting roorii should hs~ anipl~ space t.o accomniodat,e individual desks or tables nrrnngd in aisles so that the instructor may have easy access to every student at work in the room. In the shorthand rooms, a table wide enough to scat men on bot,h sides is desirable. Tile number of t,ables will be determined by the size of the room allotted. However, the smaller rooms are dcsirable, for these enable the instructor to concentrate 011 fewer students in each class. More efficient results may be obtained from two classes of ten men each than can be obtained from the lsrger class of twenty men. Blackboard space is essential for the shorthand room. The typewriting room ought to be equipped with machines representative of the standard popular makes. Inasmuch ns all typewriter con~panies offer an educational discount to schools, there is no reason to equip with one make of machine to the ex- clusion of all others. Folding top desks are desirable as furniture. These are rather costly, and for this reason, locally constructed tables may have to be substituted. If this is done, the tables should meet the standard specifications of typewriter deslis as far ns height is concerned and should be of sturdy construction of wcll-seasoned material to insure long wear. Careful attention sliould bc given to the chairs in this department. Correct posture is essential to successful progress in typewriting and too often the chair does not permit the proper position at the machine. Classrooms should be allotted for use in the teaching of the principles of bookkeeping. It is desirable that students enrolled in this subject be given two or three successive hours for work and instruction in the classroom. \\Vitli this thought in mind, space should provide adequate desk room for half of the cnroll~nent in this department at one timc. Tables to seat no more thnn two men at each and suitable chairs are suggested as furniture. Ample blackboard space for instruction purposes and hullrtin I~oards con- veniently placed for display of studcnt work and progress charts should be provided. Three or four small clnssrooms should be available for the other business training activities. One largc room arranged to simulate n modcrn business office should bc provided for accounting and oflice practice. In addition to the usual chairs and tables to :Iceom- modate the studrnts in this office practice department, space should nlso be ~~rovided for calculating nlnchincs, booklieeping machines, and other pr:~ctical mechanical devices found in the modern office. Nccessnry equipment to provide training in transcribing records made on the Ediphonc or other similar recording n~acliines is also ndvisable, es~)(~eially if these are employed in the offices of the institution. Both the ditto and the minicogrnph typcs of duplicat- ing rnncliincs slioultl bc a part of thc cquipnlc~lt for this school. 34s Correctional Education Today fMateria1 Provisions 349 Sot only do these offer a specialized type of training for conlrncrcid students, but they can also be ~nade to contribute a real scryim to the institution itself. All equipment provided for t,he conlmercial school should bc up- to-dat.e at the time of purchase. Too much stress cannot be p1nc.d on the ad;-isability of offering modern business training. If ;he work is to serve as a rehabilitative agency, men who have pun\\lrd the studies and cornpleted the courses must be assured that their training and sl.:ills will find an accepted place in the frcc-rvorld commercial fields. Textbooks and workbooks for commercial training are svnilnl,lc from sel-era1 sources. Prison schools will find the Gregg Compnny cstendi~ig every :lid to \\rho meet t.he ~arious achievement tests the same certificates of award as are given to studcrits in public commercial scl~ools. SOL onl~r docs this company extend the usual trade discounts to tlir instit,utional schools, but it supplies at no cost a wealth of teaching !~ir-its, practicc material, and progress tests. Three or four pu!- lishrrs sl)ccializc in rnatcrial for bookkeeping thrse conlpanics maintains a dcpartment whose sole purpose i~ to assist schools in every possible manner. Provisions for Agricultural Training If thc institution ouTns or operates exterlsive farms, then the nerd for and the scope of the work in the agricultural departrncnt can and sllould be cstensive not only from the standpoint of train- in!: for inmates hut for service to the institution itself. E~CV Institution, even those within the boundaries of a city with littlr or no farm lnnd l~nder cultivation in the adjacent rural nrcn, intcrcstcd la~xrns, properly arranged flower beds, n!d trimmed to present an attractive ~~~~~~~~~~~~. 5uch :~rtivities, rectricted in scope as they arc, offer the mearls for instruction a~id training of a specinlizcd nature certain to appcfil to n fen. Irl!n%tcs, at 1c2st. Thc space in tlic educational building assigncd to the ngricr~lttlr~ TI orlc will be dctrrnlincd by 1)rogranl decided uw. instriiction i.; espcrimcbnl* rc,latcd to the various phnscs of agricultural activites in the institu- tion itself, much progress may be accomplished in a limited aren for :ictual clnssroon~ work. ?, Probably no more than eight classrooms to accommodate a rnnximum of twenty-five students each should provide the required space for all formal instruction in an institution which proposes an extensive agricultural program. The furniture for these rooms would be similar to all other classrooms in the school unit. Black- board and bulletin board space is desirable and all available wall space should be employed for these features. In addition, shelves or bookcases shoulcl be provided in each room for the systematic nrrnngemcnt of the yearbooks and many bulletins available frorrl the Federal Department of Agriculture and from the various esperimental stations throughout the nation. Subject matter of this type is scientific in its approach and treatmcnt of varied phases of agriculture work, and when supplemented by textbooks in related subjects, provides adequate classroom teaching material as well as suggestions for many projects and experiments on the farms or on designated plats within or closely adjacent to the institution. A science department with adequate laboratory space to meet the educational needs of the institution is highly desirable. The lnhoratory should be placed adjacent to tlie ngriculture school and probably assigned to this department for administrative purposcg-. Its use would not be restricted to the members of this dcpartment. I3igli school science students would do thcir work in the laboratory; many problems in the vocational school could be solved in tile laboratory; and analyses and tcsts for every department of the institution, kitchen, power house, farms, sewage disposal, etc., could be performed in this unit. The size of the room and the extent of the furniture and supplies would be determined by the program contemplated. The furniture for tllc discussion room should be arranged so that demonstrations and expcrimcnts conducted from thc desk at the front of the room could be readily obcervcd from all pnrts of the room. Ground space uitliin the prison proper and conveniently located to the agricultural school should bc set nside for :t greenhouse and cxpcriment~l plat. Although this grccnliouse is separate from the education building proper, it sliould be considered an integral part of the building program. The opportunity afforded in this project for a type of speci:tlized tmining more a~ld more in dcinand, combined with tlic valuable contributions potentially available to the institution itself, justifies the iriclusiorl of this feature in the educational program. 330 Correctional Education Today Provisons for Vocational Training The inlportance of a vocational or trade school in the instiiu- t,io~inl educational program is generally recognized. Thc limit the appropriation and the needs of the greatest 11umber of inmalrn are the determining factors in the amount of building space to b allotted for instruction in this field. In the vocational school, rb building itself is the smaller item of expenditure. The ccluipmml and supplies represent the larger cash outlay. Outmoded nnd dBw carded ~nachiliery may be secured for transportation charges; hut such equipment has little value for training purposes. Thcrc are two desirable methods of housing trade trpining or vocat,ional education. The ideal situation is part time class srork in which related information dealing directly with the specific trade is t,aught, and part time ~ork in the shops where the mnnipu- lativc skills necessary to the trade are learned. As it is essentisl to teach both related information and n~anipulative skills, houping arrmigerncnts must be made to care for both of these activities. T!lc relnted information can be t,aught either in classrooms com- plctcly divorccd from t.he shops or, if space is provided, the relntrvf information can be taught in the shop. There are arguments Imtb ior 2nd against each plan. In either case, suitable classroom fur- niture and equipment must be provided. If the shops are on a production basis, the usual practice is to teach the related informn- tion in out.sidc classrooms. It is desirable to have the shops on a production basis as a t,ruer trade situation will exist and nlorc modcrn equipment may be provided. The mat,erials and, equipment necessary for instruction nnd training in a vocation or trade should compare favorably with tlic esrlle equipment and material used by that trade in modern I,usincss and industry. If the objective of reformation is to lm stre~sed t,hrougli ne\\v occupational efficiency, then we must hsvp nlodrrn trade training equipment. Eficient trade training cannot be done ~vitii cast-off and outmoded material and equipment. In view of the foregoing discussion relating to the mct'hods for presenting vocatiorlal or trade work, the ~~olicy of the school adminis- t,raiion and tlic rlnturc of the prison industries in each institution, aJ well as the occup:itional opportunities in the stnte, will influence tl~ amount of space assigned to the trade school. Before the find dccision on thc ~opc of training and the type and arrangement of equipmcnt is rcachcd, it wouId be helpful for the building committee to confer with some authority in this field, such as a representative f-- Material Provisions 351 of the Bruce Publishing Company, nlilwaukee, IVisconsin. Bruce's Shop Annual and Bruce's Specification Annual are also aids in sclccting equipment. These b001is present the equipment needs of various vocational training activites more completely than space in this chapter permits. With the type of training and the amount of equipment determined upon, a judicious allotment of space is possible. The multi-activity room described in the School Shop Annual (Bruce Publishing Company, March, 1937, page 82) is worthy of special mention. Space for a multi-activity room is highly desirable in every trade school, and especially so in a prison. Equipment for elementary tasks in many trades is set up in this room and the newly arrived inmate desiring vocational or trade school training may spend a month or six weeks in this department adjusting him- self to prison life and orienting himself to the proposed work. The equipment in this room should be practical and suitable for use in making many of tlie repairs and replacement of worn parts to the tools used in the various dcpartnlerlts of the institution. A section of this room, equipped with reading tables and chairs and provided with literature relating to the many vocations, is especially valuable for guidance work. A shop for farm machinery repair worli should be provided if there is an agricultural school or any amount of farming carried on by the institution. The agriculture and the vocational school cooperates in the training worli, and the farm superintendent nclcomes this service to his department. The importance of printing as a training activity and the value of the printshop to the ilistitution itself combine to make the space for this activity doubly useful. Radio service and repair has become a well estab- lished trade. TJ7itli many institutions maintaining radio facilities for reception as well as for broadcasting, adequate space for train- ing in the upkeep of institutional radios alone is dcsirnble. To enhance the value of the drafting course, space with moderr1 equipment for malting blue prints should be provided. Procisions jor Radio and A~~rlitoriunl ilctiuitics Radio acti\\+ties are varied. Space in the vocationnl school for training in service and repair has been suggested. Reference has been made to equipment in the clcctrical shop and science depnrt- 352 Correctional Education Today Material Provisions 353 ment for special study and csperiments in radio work. The nctu] broadcasting and entertainment phases of this activity arc p!* important. It is suggested that space in the building be allotted for m assem1)ly room or auditorium lsrgc enough to accommodntc at one time the school enrollment, thus cnabling the students to nssen~ble for any program-lecture, entertainment, or visual rclu. cation feature-which may be available. In orier to makc u~c slides and films, whose value as a teaching aid is so often disrtgnrtlrd, this room should be provided with heavy curtains at all windown and equipped with a screen and projectors for both slides nnd moving picture films. A stage properly constructed for radio broadcasting and equipped ~ith c~ntrol rooms and microphones offers facilities for training in ~imulating broadczsting as well as providing for the release hy remote control through the local radio station of those program$ n hich the prison ofiicials deem worthy to enter the homes of thcl listening public. T11c auditorium should be made sound-proof, thus providing thr m~~sit dcpartment with an ideal room to use for ensemble practices. In addition, a limited space to provide a series of sound-poof pnc- tice and ir:struction rooms for dci1artri1cnt ~ould con~plete a well-rounded progrnm ior training in the various phases of entertainment activities. Provisions for the Library Few institutions are provided with adequate library facilities, In those n hich hare suitable housing arrangements and rcsdin;: room space, but located in an area not readily accessible to the tho01 I)uild~ng proper, space in rooms of the various s~hoolq slloald be provic!cd for reference books, magazines, and 1)0oL* to special suLjccts. Such an arrangement rc(1uirc.s th:it inniatc librarians on detached service from the library prorxr be nssi:_.ncd t:, care for these special libraries. The li'l~r~rj- sllou1Ci Le planned as an integral part of the school plant. Xdcrluatc space for stacks, loari and receiving dcsks, nrid reading rooms should be provided in that part of the school build- ing easily :tcccs~iblc to all units of the school and convenient for those inmates not enrolled in forrllal school work. The number of r-olu~nes and the population of the institution will dcterminc tbc floor area of the library unit. Although bookbinding may well be considered a trade worthy of a place in the vocational school, this activity lends itself to tile library organization. Prompt attention to repairing and rebinding the library books add many nionths and years of service to the life of a book. Again, many magazines, both technical and literary, siiould be bound for future use; this is a service more promptly per- formed with the bookbinding department a part of the library. Limited space is required for efficient work in this department; equipment needs are inexpensive and easily construct,ed within the institution; and supplies will depend upon the amount of work done but represent only a few cents for each volume repaired or rebound. Prouisions for Handicraft ilctivities The building committee is urged to be liberal in its allot.nlent of space for instruction and Draining in handicrafts. The space may be divided into three sect,ions. One may be used for general hobby work. This room would require little or no equipment aside from benches. The limited equipment necdcd and all supplies consumed are sometimes provided by the inmatts themselves. A second sec- tion could profitably be given over to a type of instruction and training for the physically handicapped. Equipment for this section should provide a wide choice of act,ivity for the innlates and should be chosen and employed with training for occ~~paiional rehabilitation the aim and the object. The third section should be maintained for therapy purposes. The medical psychiatric dcpart- ments are in a position to offer valuable suggestions in regard to the type of equipment for this room 2nd probably would bc willing to provide a supervisor trained in occupat~ional therapy to direct this activity. Prot:isions for Recreation and Physical Education Recreation and physical educntion are important phases of the institutional educntion:tl program. .The recreation program should be broad n,nd varictl so as to cnlist t,he interest and etyort of every inmate. l'ile material requircrncnts for a good recreation program arc too numerous to be dcscribcd :~dcquntely here. --I g>-~nn:lsiu~n feet by 11inct.y fcct and n large playing field arc the rnajor needs. Detailed standards and spccifi- cations for gyinnnsiuills and plnying fields are givcn in on for Junior I-Iigh Scliool Build- ings and their bool; entitled Standards for High School l3uildings. i. 354 Correctional Education Today Material Provisions 355 Standards are also available from the National Recreation A,- ciation and from the manufacturers of athletic and gymnasium equipment. Recommendations for General Building Construction and Service Systems -4t lrast eighty per cent of the floor space of the education build- ing sIlould be given over to instructional purposes. The srrsngr- nlent of the classrooms, assembly room, laboratories, shops, office#, and lavatories should be planned and designed so that cnctl i~ readily accessible with a minimum of travel through corridor ~nd stairway space. These t~vo items, corridors and stair~vags, must be planned for maximum efficiency in the movement of the inmatixi. for safcty, and so as to facilitate supervision. The exact witlth of the corridors cannot be stated, for each building presents its onn problem. It is not necessary that all corridors be of uniform \\\\idth. At points of entrmce and exit, greater width is desirable thnn in that section nhere fewer inmates may be expected at any one time. Cross corridors, if used, may be narrower than the main corridors of the building. The location of the stairways is important. Urldrr no circu~nstances can their constructioll over heating units, furnnccs of any kind, or stoclirooms in which inflammable materials nrr stored be justified. Tlie safcty of the occupants of the building demands that thc quality of the material used in the construction of the corridom and stairways be of the best. Fire-proof construction in the cntirt building is highly desirable; in any event, corridors and the stnir- ways must be of non-inflammable material. At least tmo, prcfcr- ably three, entrances are desirable. If possible, provisions should be rnadc for additional exits in cascs of emergency. Both the entr:inccs and exits should be located and constructed SO as to insure s~ifety in crzse of fire, and adcquate supervision. Based on the grouping of buildings by the American Institute of Archi- tecture, the institutional school building ought to meet thc re- quirements of a TYPE h building: constructed entirely of fi* resistive materi:ils including roof, ~rindo\\\\.s, doors, floors, and finish. Even though the building is fire-proof, its contents are inflnm- mable, and therefore, fire estinguishcrs sliould be ~rovided tlirou~li- out the entire school. First aid lits are also important, espccinlb in the vocational school and laboratories. Training in the of these is essential. /-- Toilets and lavatories should be located in accessible, though inconspicuo~s places, and unrestricted observation of the conduct of the occupants at all times must be possible. The fixturcs in these rooms should meet all the requirements of the plumbing code. Conveniently placed drinking fountains of the bubble-type are desirable. Storage space, equipped with shelves, lockers, and other accessor- ies should be provided. Often systematic arrangements of the materials will greatly reduce the floor space needed for these pur- poses. Inasmuch as the contents of the storage rooms are usually inflammable, these rooms should not be located near stairways or exits. An office with proper furniture for each supervisor is essential. Study and reading space should be provided for teachers. The space occupied by the director of education should include his office suit- ably equipped for efficient \\~orli and a record room large enough to accommodate the clerical force necessary for maintaining conlplcte and accurate information relating to the educational progress and general achievenle~lts of each inmate enrolled in the school. Labor, a costly item in any construction program, is at hand in the institution for use on the school building. Since the lnbor cost in prison construction is negligible if inmate help is used, a greater portion of the funds is availablr for the purchase of material which goes into the construction of the building. The walls of all roonls and corridors should be plastered, the number of coats determined by the type of materials used. The last coat should be troweled to a smooth finish. Sand finish and other ornamental finishes become a catch-all for dust and dirt; for sani- tary reasons, tlley should be avoided. In the vocational sci:ool, brick or tile finished walls are advisable. The ivalls ought to be decorated even before the rooms are used. The color scheme employed for the decorations is important and may be slightly modified to meet the natural lighting conditions in various parts of the building. The material used in the clccoratiliq slloultl be of such a nature and type that it is easily clcancd ~\\itllout losing its value as a decorating agent. Special attention must be given to the type of floors used through- out the entire building. Tile floors in the corridors arc satisfactory, but such material does not lend itstlf for classroom floors outsidr the vocational or trade school. l'err:~zzo, when propcrly fi~iisflcd on a solid base to avoid cracking, makes an attractive floor and is 356 Correctional Education Today Material Provisions 357 easily kept clean. However, the committee should consider arl] the advisability of using battleship linoleum or one of the mnny no=- i~lflamrnable cork composit~ion materials manufactured for flcwBr covering. Any of these, properly cemented to a smooth conrmtc surface makes an ideal floor covering for use in classrooms. :\\a a last resort, concrete floors carefully finished and ,painted rcgu13r12. can be used throughout the entire building. The cost of kcej)inK r concrct,e floor so that it makes a presentable appearance shoul~d I* considered bcforc this is accepted. Because of the many ty1m u! flooring and floor covering available, wood floors should be nvoidrii. 1Vindon.s extending from a height of about three fcet from tht. floor to the ceiling on outside esposures of every room are dcsirsl,lc. If possible, tlie window space should represent an area equal to st lcn~t, twent,y-five per cent of the floor space of the room. Thc typr of ~vindoiv frames and size of the glass will be determined 1)y the type of arcl~itecturc employed. All clear glass should bc of grsti,.

Translucent shades should be used as thy i\\.iI! keep out the direct rays of the sun but will allow considcmi~ic light to filter through. Even thougli the use of the schoolroom is limited to days, the natural light from the windows is not sufficient for a11 hours of the day and for all kinds of weather and must be supplemented with n SJ-stcm of artificial lighting. If night classes are organized, the lighting of tlie rooms is a greater problem. Building plans ~hou!(! pro\\-idc for ample electric light installations.

Iiere t.he lighting, ~vhcther direct, indirect, or a combination of both of these, must he carefully :~rrtlnged so that shadoivs will be e2imi- nated and a clear unintcrruptcd vielv of the operation at hand is possible at a11 times.

The heating plant may require an additional unit or more efficient operation of the present units; but the laying of the conduit for the steam or hot water into the building and the pipes for the gravity or syphon return of the water or condensed steam represents the only construction outside the building itself. The radiator surface for each room is easily computed and the type of radiator chosen should assure ample surface to meet the knoll n requirements. Thermostatic control for each room is desirable, thus assuring uniform temperature under all weather conditions. Ventilation is an important factor in every scl~oolroom. Un- fortunately, the ventilating facilities of many institrltions are of little value for a school. To meet this situation, n ventilating unit, independent of the remainder of the institution, should be irlstalled in the scliool building and the necessary equipment provided to obtain desirable resalts. To attempt ventilation control by open- ing windows is to invite trouble with the heating department. A humidifier should be installed in conjunction with the ventilating unit. The additional expenditure for this outfit can be justified in more efficierit working conditions and savings in the heating costs. Conclusion This chapter has described the minimum material provisions for a good institutional educational unit. The school buildings at Sing Sing and Attica Prisons and Elmira Reformatory in Sen York State approsirnate these standards, as do the educational units at certain Federal institutions. A new school building which embodies most of these rccommendstions is about to bc constructed at the h-ew York State T'ocational Institution. The plans for the ncw Green Havcn Prison in New York include an educational building housing classrooms, shops, an auditorium-gymnasiunl and other features which indicate that an escellent school plnnt will be pro- vided. It should also be said that, while scparate school buildings are desirable, some institutions such as \\Yallkill Prison in Xew 1-ork have so adapted their regular plant ns to make possible a very desirable school program. Most school plants built in correctional in~t~itrltions in rcccnt years reflect the realization of the need for 3 variety of educational activities to meet the needs of thc individual innlate. 358 Correctional Education Today BIBLIOGRAPHY AIochlman, The Public School Plant Program.

Correctional Education Today The problem of t,he discharged prisoner has always been a difficult one. Society has not yet learned how to punish a man and reform him at the same time. Undoubtedly many Irieri are released from prison no better and possibly worse than when they vent in. But inany nien also leave prison with a well-formed resolve to go straight -a resolve n-hich subsequently breaks down vlien they attempt to confront a hostile or unsynlpathetic society single-handed. It was in recognition of these facts that \\vise men who had the intcrcsts of the community uppermost in their minds proposed that a period of supervision be added to tlie end of a man's prison term. Son, the only ~ay that this can be accomplished and the very necessary elerrlent of compulsion retained is (1) to provide a sentence longer than the ti~ne that a prisoner should properly and just,ly be retained in prison, (2) t,o release him into the community bcforc thc expiration of that full time, (3) to keep him under strict surveillance and scnd him back to prison on the first indication of l~is failure to conform. From this point of view parole is seen to be :ln extension arid not a diminution of the sentence, and it becomes another cle~nf,~!t for the protection of society. I'crlin~~s we have made a mistake in referring to s. parole as being granted to ,In individual when, as a matter of fact, we are justified in most instances in referring to the process of supervised release as sorncttiing to n-hich he is being subjected. Prison wardens can testify to the fact that many prisoners prefer the old method of release to tlie one which keeps them undcr surveillance a long time. There are other advantages to s good parole system which do nut in any way diminish the punishment properly imposed on a wrongdoer. It makes it possible to (1) adjust the date of release to a time when employment can be obtained for the parolee, (3) provide an incentive for good behavior, (3) assist a well-intent,ioned prisoner t,o rchabilit,ate himself, (4) return z violator without trial, nrid (5) enal~le the authorities to keep a check on the msn's conduct atid n.hcrc:~bouts. Sone of these things is possible undcr the definite scntence s>-stcm. A ccirc:ful scrutiny of the stat.istics available will sllo~v severai srirprising things to those people who are accustomed to agree with cieriunc.iations of pnrole. 1. The figures will indicate that in good parole systems, such as ?.tiat of the I?ederal Government, not more than ten per cent of clischargcd prisorlcrs violate regulations during tlie period of their 11:iroIe. Institutional Training-Post-Institutional Adjustment 361 2. They will indicate that n surprisingly small percentege-less than one per cent-of all the men noiv being arrested for crime (not only major crimes but all crime) are found to be on parole at the time of arrest. The last issue of Uniform Crime Reports pub- lished by t,he United States Department of Justice ~vllich gave figures of this sort covered the first three months of 1935. During that period the total number of arrests cleared in Washington for finger-print identification, for all crimes, was 00,504. Of that number the individuals found to be on parole at the t'ime of arrest totaled 509. We have heard it said repeatedly that an astonishingly high percent.age of serious crimes now being com- mitted are by men on parole. These same statistics indicate 1,535 arrests for criminal homicide, but a table in the same issue indicates that not a single one of these persons when arrested n.as found to be on parole. 3. They will sho~v that the time served in prison previous to a release on parole is on t,he average longer than the time served when the sentence as cornplctrd. This last fact is proved by figures gathered from Census Bureau reports and from recent studies rnade in Massachusetts and Illinois. Illinois is one of the states where pnrole has been most under attack from certain sections of the press. .-I recent survey in that, state disclosed the fact that under t'he old definite-sentence sytrm the time served in prison for the three major crimes of robbery, burglary and larceny averaged 6.3 years but t,hat, since men liave been released by the pnrole met,hod on tlie det,ermination of the State Board of Parole, the average length of 3 sentence for one of these three crimes is 8.1 years. Of course, it is easy to affix the blame when a paroled man goes wrong-much easier than to criticize the police, district ntt.orrieys, and courts for any misguided leniency on their part. And it is 1il;en.ise difficult to discover the thousands 2nd tcns of t,hou,;ands of prisoners who hxve justified the faith of parole boards and ~rlio have not bccn subsequently rearrestcd. One 1le:irs only of the occasional case wliicli scenis to indicate lack of judgment or posi- t,ive ven:llity on the part of a pnrole bortrtl. It is safe to say )..hat. today many more mistakes are being made t.hroughout t,he country on t'he side of too grent severity than too much lcnicncj~. One c:~nnot. inln~cdiately discover mis- takes of this sort \\rithout lool;ing into our prisons. 362 Correctional Education Today The case of John Dillinger has been held up as a shining example . of parole failure. As a mattcr of fact, as Governor 3IcNutt of Indiana himself pointed out, Dillinger was held in prison for nearly nine years for complicity in a crinie for which his older associate served less than three. Might it not be that Dillinger's pre- eminence as a public enemy was owing as much to an overdosc of prison as to any mistaken leniency? The niscr and more careful the system of parole which is devised, thr more protective it will be. Parole rvhich is merely equivalent to pardon is never as effective or as safe as parole administered by a full-time non-political board which has the benefit of all the facts ~rith reference to the prisoner and his community. Unless we are prcpnred completely to abandon any idea of reform, even for the most trivial offense, we must some day release each criminal from prison; and, n-hcn we do, what safer method than parole can possibly be devised? It cannot be gainsaid, however, that the process of readjusting a prieoucr in society is a difficult one. So difficult is it that s business Inan recently printed an article in Forunz itlagazine entitled, \"I<ecp Your Convicts.\" His theory was that when the average institution had had a man in its custody for a substantial length of time, he had been rendered unfit for reassimilation into the com- munity. llr. Rollman was talking about the effect of the tradi- tional prison upon its inmates. The whole purpose of this book is to show that it is possible for prisons to become places where citizenship can be reconstructed through the educative process and that it will be safer for the com- munity nhcn such a plan can become general. Unless the prisons arc to he forccd to keep their convicts indefinitely, the attempt at education described in this book must sooner or later, in the inter- est of the public, be adopted. Therc are three reasons why readjustment of the prisoner into civil life is a process of surpassing difficulty. In the first place, the prison is expected to be a place of punishnlent. \\\\'hen s man goes there he is under suspicion, restraint, constant survt~illanrc, hc is put in a steel cell behind a high wall, and armed guards stand 1)c.tn.cen him and the public. The traditional emphssis of the prisoil is upon drprivation and colitrol. This is not the clirnatc in ~~hich reinspircd or rccducnted. It has oftcn bcen rcmnrkcd by wardens and others how difficult it is for a high- strung individual to acc~istom llimself to the restraints of prison Institutional raini in^-post-institutional Adjustment 363 life. Difficult it is, indeed, but no more so than the process of reorienting the prisoner to free living outside of the prison. It is becoming increasingly apparent that it is difficult to punish and inspire men at one and the same time. In the second place, thc problem of providing work for the dis- charged prisoner is one which is even more difficult than that of providing stimulating industrial opportunities for the man while he is in prison. Here again we find an important relationship between the institutional training and the post-institutional adjust- ment. It will be futile to give prisoners an opportunity for voca- tional education or to lavish time and money on thcm in the hopc they may thereby become better equipped to support themselves if, on release, there are to be no positions for them to fill. The problem of unemployment is difficult enough in itself these dsl-s, but add to that the inevitable prejudice against mcn who havc bcen to prison and you find the whole prison problem assuming a charac- ter of exceptional difficulty. A man incurs a civil obligation and when he pays it he regains the confidence and respect of his ncigl~borhood. But if, through an act ~vhich many times may be on the line between a criminal and a civil obligation, he is called upon to pay a penalty to the public, the fact that he pays it oftentimes scems to add to his dis- grace rnthcr thsn purge him of it. There have bcen outstanding examples of nlen who have beaten down public mistrust and over- come obstacles to make of themselves a success in spitc of the prison esperience. One could call the roll of such individuals and find a surprisingly large number of men who turned out to be useful citizens. But it is evident that before our penitentiary system can realize its newer aims, a more tolcrant and far-sighted attitude must be developed in the community to~rards the es- prisoner. Po long as the Army and the Kavy and the Civil Service dcny him the right to employment, it is rnthcr difficult to expect private industry to employ him. But unlcss hc can be cmplo~.ed there is little chnncc of his being able to breast thc waves of prejudice and 1;ecp liimsclf out of thc criminal ranks. The right to fight for his govcrnmcnt, thc right to work out his debt to society by rendering service to his government must be denied and the taspnycr must shouldcr thc burden, supporting such men cithcr in idleness or in institutions. The n-holc thing docs not secnl to rnalce scnsc. If a man is nrrcstcd and serves his tcrrn in the work housc for an assault, 364 Correctional Education Today is he any the less Likely to make a good soldier? One does not need to advocate that the battleships be manned entirely by ex-convicts, but one can insist that some discrinlination be shown 2nd that the wholesale proscription against employing the ex-convict no matter who or what he is, is not wholly in the public interest. In the third place, if prisoners are to be reformed, the regenera- tion must take plnce in their emotional attitudes as wcll as in their physical and mental capacities. Dr. Pauline Young recently studied thc records of two thousand male probationers in the Los Angeles County district. She came to the conclusion as a result of this study that thcsc men were not only deficient in formal education but more than that they lacked what she calls \"social intelligence.\" Thty had no \"roots i11 a social world which xould provide status, responsibility, challenging activities and satisfying response.\" Tl~e average prison term does something to a man emotionally. Close confiricmrnt, deprivation of family contacts and emotional starvation are the inevitable accompaniment of incarceration in ;he :~\\-cragq~,risorl of yesterday. A man emotionally thnarted ovcr n long period of yesrs is not a safe individual to be released into his communit?-. Institutional training of an inmate which docs not take iilto account this fact will not be of much assistance iu :~djusting him to post-institutional environment. A fc~: ycsrs nLo i had the opportunity to visit some of the prisons in the Solict Eepublic. There is not much that one who bclievcs in democ.r:icy in the American manner can say for the Soviet system of government but they have made one discovery in their penal syqtem. I do not refer to the manner in which they dispose of their pcilitical pfisoners; they rely in such instances or1 swift and sure punishment. But in their dealings with the nlan whom we might ~r,ll the ordinvry criminal, they employ a very definite method. Tlicy do not attempt in their treatment of him to make the two tiifficult acljustrne~lts that I referred to above. The inmates of 11lc1r colonlcs :?nd industrial prisons find institution life not much tliffercnt fro111 free life outside. There is plenty of ~vork for them io clo at standzrrl wages; they .re permitted to narrj- and raise i:lmilies while 111 thc colony, and life being nhat it is there, there 1s no pressure to \\)c released. Thus the Russian penal system solves :~li three of the iiifiic~ltirs ~5 hich I have mentioned above and still ;~rotccts the public from the depredations of the criminal. It goes without saying that u7e could not adopt such a policy hrxre but we can and must arrange conditiorls of training in our i ! Insiitutional Training-Post-Institutional Adjustment 365 institutions more definitely with the process of later adjustment in mind. The whole purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to point out the inevitable and inescapable relationship between these two parts of the penal process. hfen must be prepared physically through prophylaxis and reparatory operations, if necessary, for the resumption of life in a competitive world. They must bc trained industrially, to a specific trade if possible, but in any event they must be imbued with the habit of work if they are to be safe- guarded from later tenzptations. Their educational preparation must not be in such routine matters as the n~ultiplication table and third reader but must be education from a broader viewpoint of preparation for citizenship. Their minds must be cleared of delusions. They must be taught through sensible recreational programs how best to use the leisure time they are sure to have plenty of. And if they are one day to resume practice of partici- pating in a democracy, it may be well even in prison to teach them the democratic method. Graduation from prison to freedom outside becomes a risky process ~vhen it is too sudden. The terrible picture of a broken down individual wit11 a shaved head and a prison pallor is fortun- ately not as common as in the old days. This process of preparation is now a progressive one. Frm t!;c c!osslj- Luiit ceii, to tile indi- vidual room, the dormitory, to the honor group, to tl~e opcn camp, to supervised parole, to ultimate freedom is the logical process of readaptation. Doubtless there will still be those who say that such a program nil1 not have the same deterrent value as a more condign system. TVe have neither space nor time here to discuss the question of punishment as a deterrence but me do have ample instance> \\v!lcre a method of preparation for citizenship, something like the one outlined above, has worked grcater protcctiorl to our comnlunitics than a systc~u which relies solely upon punishment. The I\\-omen's institutions of thc country are less like prisorls than any of our penal cstnllishments. Tilere is less of shocl; of xdjust- ing in and out of them and yet their percellrage of successful rcfornlations is substantially highcr thnn those of the men's prisons. The states which practice rllodcr~l methods of p:trole properly prcpnred for and properly super~ised, scem to have less crime than states with a morc punitive prison system. I recall one striking demonstration of the value of institutional training as contributing to latcr success. The superintcndcnt of a 3GG Correctional Education Today shoe shop in one of the large federal penitentiaries followed the careers of sixty of the men who had had the opportunity to learn thc shoc busincss under him. Of the sisty men as to whom he had definite inform:ttion, only one had gotten into any kind of difficulty -a per cent of slicccss many times higher than that of the average run of prisoners. In considering, therefore, the question as to what part education can play in prison administration, let us have the longer view. It m:ly not be wise to hand the prisoner a parole application as soon as he gets to the prison but it will be a farsighted prison system that starts nbout rather early in the prisoner's term to prepare him against the day of his release. If we do nccept this longer view of the problem of post-institutional adjustment, all of these institu- tional services including psychiatry, medical service, classification, social ~rork, cducation and industry, will contribute to our ultimate success. It will be of little value to our communities to educate ox prisoners u111css we educate them for a purpose, and that pur- pose should be their successfl~l readjustment in society. Only thus cnn the money we spend on prison administration be justified and only thus can the public be ultimately protected.

CHAPTER XIX STIMULATING INTELLIGENT PUBLIC INTEREST IN CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION by William E. Grady Associate Superintendent in charge of Vocational High Schools New York City Popular Misconceptions Regarding Crime and Penal Treatment If one xere to ask the average man or woman what he expects of a priso~i, the obvious answer would be that the prison is a social device for the incarceration of the lanrbreaker, for the punishment of the individual and the security of society. This basic attitude of the public is conditioned by numerous factors such as the emotional shock of glaring headlines regarding the exploits of criminals of the Dillinger type and deeply rooted beliefs that criminals constitute a class apart, that the expenditure of vast sums for the building of rnnsimum security prisons is a sound social investment, that imprisonment for 2nd as punishment is justifiabie and that ~mprisonmcnt of proper duration and severity is the best protection against future criminality. The naive public attitude that the problem of the criminal is something apart from community life and responsibility and can he left to the police, the judicinry and the warden accounts for the belated improvement of penal systems that often fail to justify their existence beyond the bare fact that for a limited tinie 3 relatively small number of those who have broken the criminal law are incarcerated for better or for ~vorsc-often for the latter. If one is critically minded, onc may well ask: ''\\JThy prisons at all?\" They are not very old institutions. The old cell block at Sing Sing \\\\-as n relative novelty in its dzy, resulting from the work of Hownrd in Eng1:~nd and the Quaker influcuce in Pennsylvania. About 1800, the latter Ftzte developed a systcnl of solitary con- finement which was considered a nlarked advance. A little lnter at Auburn in Nen York State, tllcre was devclopcd an improved system which provided group work by day, separation by night and enforced silence at a11 times. Crude as the prisons \\\\-ere and still are, tlicy mark a broad humnnitarian advance over thc crucl- 3GS Correctional Education Today Stimulating Public Interest 369 ties of an earlier day when death, exile and mutilation were the t ypicnl penalties, and also over the practices of ear-croppings, brandings, floggings, the ducking stool and esposure in the stocks :tnd pillories used during colonial days. The earlier prisons, as well as many of the present day-poorly built, badly equipped and inefficiently managed-were places of punishment but not agencies of rehabilitation. In view of the fact, tlmt, with the exception of those condemned to death and life imprisonment, most of the inmates of practically every prison will be back in community life in ten years, one must challenge tile uncritical attitude of the public and develop a broader concep- tion of the functions of the prison. The public through its agents should no longer thrust the culprit through a prison gate and then treat him as a forgotten man. Security in the present moment may be assured by prison bars but what of the future when the inmate is returned to social life? 11-hilc drama may attach to thc incarceration of the la~vbrcalier, the less dramatic moment of his release is of equal or greater im- portance as a result of imprisonment in the penitentiary or prison. Is he really penitent and are we sending him forth a better man competent to bear his burden in life? If we expect to better prison norli, nc. must sell the new objectives to the public through the prcss, books, pu'hiic discussions, ieg~slative enactment, organiza- tion of con~missions and the work of such agencies as the Ncw york Prison A~socistion, the Osborne Association, the American Prison A~socistion, the Sational Probation Association and the welfare agcncics of the several religious denominations. 1Vlicn sn atrocious crime has been committed, whether it be a murder, a roLbery or a kidnapping, the public mind instinctively dcnla~lds I-engeance. The criminal becomes that pariah of society nhose immediate incarceration or death is demanded without regard to the possibilities of salvage or rehabilitation. The machine gun replaces the j~~dicial process. The \"G\" man is the hero of the !lour. -4 debt to society has been incurred and must be psid. Emo- tional renctions, r?.t!l.er than cool judgment, color the pub!ic mind to the csclusion of the broader social viewpoint that should deter- :nilic our attitude with reference to the average criminal who must riinke anlends but for n horn society is obligated to do \\~hntcver nlay be possible to restore him to a deccnt, honest livelihood. 1s the crimi:lal a type and class different from most of us? Firtional characters such as Ramcs and Bill Sykcs, as \\\\.ell as the earlier doctrines of Lombroso concerning physical stigmata, are still tlie basis of what Austin MacCormick calls \"our arrogance of respectabilit,y\" that disregards the accepted fact that the average criminal is not a type but very like most men. He is the social result of many complex forces of heredity, home, family, church, recreational, vocational and social influences; a large element of chance beyond the control of the individual determines \\vhetlicr he shall become a criminal or a respectable member of society. In the public mind, the espensive walled masimum security prison is the one best answer to the challenge of the undcrivorld. Ask a New Yorker what arc the several types of prisons tnspayers provide in his State. While the answer \\rill depend upon the nearest penal institution, in Ke\\v York City the typical reply would refer to cithcr Sing Sing or Dannemors. It is hardly neccs- sary to point out how erronrous is this ~ieri-point. Public opinion lags far behind the modern conception that on the basis of many factors of personality,.niental and emotional ability and stability, social attitude, criminal history, future opportu11it.y in terms of social and vocational prospects. \\re must provide not one but Illany types of institutions if rehabilitation, as well as punishment, is to be our chief object,ive. JYhile the culprit \\vho has broken the 1n.xvn.ith the rcsu!ti!:,rr 1~:s~ ~f life or prc;prrty is sent to prison as punishment, the oldcr conception which still prevails in the public mind is t,llat he has :Jso bccn sent to prison for puriish~nerit. The average layman rends with grim satisfaction that S was sent to prison for so many years at hard labor regardless of the fact that in most prisons the conditions of the sentcnce cannot be conlpliecl with because of t,llc limited nunll~er of product,ive shops, the ban on intcrstfitc shipments of prison- mndc goods and the indecent overcroirding. ot,her words, in msny of our overcro~\\rded prisons, liard labor is a myth and instend there is degr:~ding idleness. The basic punishment and also an educ:lt,ion31 and recrcatiorlnl progmm-a plan of prison life which the averagc cit,izen considers ncithcr possible nor dcsir:lble. The outn~odcd conception thnt prisons should be nlnint~nincd chicfly for punishment was the bnsis of solitary corifincn~ent, b:Jl 370 Correctional Education Today and chain, striped uniforms, clipped heads, lock step, bread and water diet,s and various barbaric methods such as stfill characterize t,hc county jails and chain gangs of some southern states. To what extent did such procedures re-adapt tlie inmate for life beyond the walls? If there is no appeal to the inmate's self-respect, sense of honor, satisfaction through accomplishmerit,, int'erest in self-control, desire to be profitably employed, yearning to go fort,h ghysically arid ment,ally a clean man, imprison- ment nill irievitably prove t1ia.t the prison is a failure both as s disciplinary and an educat,ional inst,itution. Fortunately, during the past two decades, prison doors have been thron-n open to intelligent, const~ructive erit.ics and t,here has been a halting but continuous advance in the modification of the older ideology which is still implanted in the public mind, that the chief function of the prison is to punish. There is more general recognition of the validity of the Declaration of Principles, adopted by the .American Prison Associat,ion as long ago as 1570, \"Since hope is a more potent agent of fear, it should be made an ever prcscnt force in the hands of prisoners. . . . Thc prisoner's destiny should be placed immeasurably in his own hands. A system of prisoii discipline to be truly reformatory must gain the will of the prisonrr. . . . The prisoner's ihc utmost. and cvcry efiort made to give back to him his manhood.\" in short, if n-e analyze the att,itude of the public towards the prison and the criminal, we become convinced that much must be done to persuade the public to develop a more intelligent, humane and productive philosophy with reference to the functions of the prison as a social sgency. Basic Concepts of Penal Treatment Which Should be Widely Disseminated Crime is an ancient evil and has always been and xi11 alvays be one of the unfortunate characteristics of community life. In one's leisure time, it might be profitable to make case history studics of such noted Gibiical characters as Cain, Solomon, David, Job and even 3loscs, and tliereby redisco~cr the crimin21 charsctcristics of even the traditional figures of niblical history. In any prison, tlie endless procession of incoming inmates in- cludes not only tlic butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker, but also the artist, the doctor, the banker, the clergyman, the juror Stimulating Public Inlerest 371 and even the judge. These are but a fraction of the total number of lawbreakers, many of whom are never apprchendcd or con- victed. It is a short-sighted policy to regard the criminal as a numbered felon without analyzing the forces that have made him so. We know that no one or two factors cause crime, and that we nced to knon- more about the part that heredity plays in the life of the psychopathic type, the family life and slum influences of the lad from tlie tenements, the defective schooling, thc ecoliomic disasters and temptations of the business man and the debasing but pro- vocative opportunit~ies in tlie life of the juvcnilc dclinquent who has never had the benefit of a decent home life or religious train- ing. The implications of such facts are that crime prevention and prison reform are essential problems with the solution of which all members of the community must be identified. The conception of prevention that has been so fruitful in dealing with other social problems such as fire, disease arid sanitation is now being applied in the field of penology as rapidly as research and experience will permit. To the problem of what influences shape the prison inmate, is added the more important one of how he could hzve been pre- vented from becoming n delinquent or a criminal. Vignrnns attacks are being made on tlie problem of juvenile delinquency by providing for improved health service, clearance of slum arcas, elimination of social diseases, improved schooling and vocational education, improved recreation and increased religious instruc- tion. This inspiring program requires not only the effort of the nation, the state and the local community, but of welfare agencies such as the scouts, public school and police athletic leagues, settle- ments, religious organizations, boys' clubs and similar welfare units. In other words, there is an awakened public interest and a deter- mined, coordinated effort is being made to stop tlie flow of crimin- ality at its source. Today we kiioi\\~ that only by individualizing children tcmper:lmcnt, sciiooling, rccreatiorl arid socinl attitudes can we discover the springs of behavior arid so educate the young'tliat they nill not becoriie tlic prcseiit-day delinquerits and the future criminals. Tlic same general principles apply to those who have gone wrong. Regimented tre:\\tmcnt, uniform punishment, demoralizing idle~iess arc riot tlie mcans of salvag- ing the delinquent or the criminal. 372 Correctional Education Today Prisons have problems that are much more difficult than the average layman conceives. Many of the inmates arc mental and moral deviates, case-hardened, dangerous, anti-social personali- ties bcyond the hope of salvage; but in view of the youthful age of t,he largest group now entering prison, it is safe to say that many are of the more hopeful type for which the prison must assunle thc responsibility of rehabilitation. Chaff and grain flow into t,hc prison hopper, but we must glean those lives that are worth --., ,,,i,,,. ,,m Tlic pxmble of the Solver has enduring significance. Apart from the better housing illustrated in the new dorn~itories, ~liess Iialls, shops, libraries, recreation ha!ls and chapels in the newer l)risons, the better classification, the better mental, medical and surgic:ll care, the scientific rations, opportunities for recreation, etc., probably t,he two most hopeful improvements are the pro- fcssio~l:ill:,- trailled ~vardcns, teachers and guards, and the intro- duction of educatio~~ in the best sense as a plan involving the ~vholc lifc of tlie inmate and t,he collduct of the institut,ion. Brutal- it\\- hns largely disappeared. The burlesque teaching, so often dc~cribcd 1,. Austin hIacCormick and Sam Lewisohn, has gone lie\\-er to rc'turn. I\\-ill a husliy illiterate, con~icted cf manslx~ightcr, rend a primer to the effect t.hat he must learn to love his teacher n-110 happened t,o be a lifer convicted of murder ill tilt first ilcgrue. So longer will an inmate with agonizirlg per- snn::l problems be quizzed about the anatomy of an ant, 3 grazs- liopper or a humming bird. Yet, such incidents have characterized the educat.iona1 progranls of the past. \\\\~lhcre educational work has bcen inaugurated, not only are in~natrs being 1iel)t abreast of the times, but in the light of personal preferences and sliills they are being prepared for their reentry into soci:ll life. It i5 very difficult to realize how tragic was the plight of the convict who had done his bit, as lie stood at, the prison gate, drcssod in a shn1,by suit with a few dollars in his pocket, facing a xvorltl that had long outdistanced him and which he must reenter undcr the nomiiial supervision of an overworked parole board. How decent and scif-rt~!i~lnt could hc be with reference to a :vcr!d that had moved ahend nhilc he nloped in a cell, receiving as his only education at a \"uni\\-ersity\" level, the endless prison chatter con- cerning tho tecliriique of the undcr~vorld'? Tlic irltelligclit public dcmands that the life of a modernized prison be so organized that the interest shift from walls and ~nacliine gulls to illmate personalities, warped though they be, and that the Stimulating Public Interest 3 73 whole life of the institution and especially the personalities of the warden, the chaplain, the guards and the teachers be such as to enter into sympathetic rapport with the inmate in order to inspire him to cast off the standards and the habits of the world of crime. The greatest responsibility is to seek to gird his loins, sharpen his brain and purify his heart for taking up responsibilities of fat,her, worker and citizen upon his reentry into life. Informing the Public and Securing Its Support To stimulate general public interest it is first necessary to find out where it already esists. Kot only are those engaged in prison work concerned with the rehabilitation of the prisoners, but educa- tors, business men, social lvorkers, government officials, arid men and women in a11 wallis of life are interested in reducing the impact of non-social conduct in the interest of society at large. Therefore, if a community as represented by governor, mayor, or other respon- sible official nishes to arouse support for a program of crimc pre- vention or correctional education or if a civic body wishes to arouse the public official, then those n ho really know the prol~lems, or some particular phase of it, togctlicr with intcrcstcd laymen, should be organized into a functionirig body. The curious and gratifying fact is that thcre are aln ays people who have never becon~e deepll- con- ccrncd nit11 s public problem, hut who will take a deep intcrcst if brought into ciose contact with it. This technique has been uscd in Sew I-orli State and to it car) be attributed most of the progress madc in the various institutions of the State. First, the Le~visohn Commission n-as appointcd by Govrrnor Franklin TI. Rooscvelt for the purpose of dercloping modern, adequate prison buildings, and later Governor Lehman appointed the Comn~ission on Education in Corrt.ctiona1 Iristitu- tions in the Stntc Nc~v York. On this commission are institu- tional officids, professors of education, superintendents of srhools, school principals, members of boards of education, and blisine~s men nith broad civic points of view. C00per:~ting heartily and cflici~iitly there !lave bcen, of course, various me111bci.s of tlic State Department of Correction. One of the first tasks of a group of this kind is to make linowa to the public at large the problems of the prisons, remembering alnays thnt the ('public at largc\" con- sists not only of many indifferent people, but :dso of prest~nlnl)ly inteIIigcnt and civic minded persons like the mcnlbers of the com- mittee itself. 374 Correctional Education Today An important feature of this plan of stimulating interest is a rccognition of the fact that the principles of good education in prison are no different from those in the regular school system. There is no mystery and certainly there need be no sensationalism. The purpose of the prison is, or should be, the training and rehabili- tation of men and tvomen who, somehow or other, did not get or failed to benefit from, such training in the public schools. The prison can be a second-chance, sometimes a last-chance, school. It is obvious that the application of these general principlcs to prison- ers requires a thoroughgoing knowledge of penology, but the cooperation of educators and penologists provides adequate oppor- tunity for making the best educational practices operate in the interest. of prisoners and society. At the same time, it must be rcmcmbcred that in isolated instances, and in piecemeal fashion, some excellent educational practices have been developed in the pzst in various prisons. This has been true in New York State and both the adnlinistration and the Commission have been alert to capitalize upon the efforts of those already in the service. The Cornmission has used various means of making its work effective. Among them have been: 1. Harmonious cooperation with all officials of the New York State Department of Correction. 2. Personai visitation to institutions and \"on-the-job\" con- sultation with institutional workers upon their present problems. 3. Employment of research workers through the use of private funds to gather facts upon which, in part, recommendations for fut,ure developments are based. 4. Preparation of int'erim reports on special phases of the work which have needed immediate attention. 5. The establishment of contacts nrith state officials and others for the promotion of new developments. 6. Sponsoring espcrimental projects for the purpose of trying out ideas and developing experience upon which to base gcn~rnl nnd s~~ccific suggcstions for the future development oi educational programs in institutions. - - 7. Stimulntion of institutional workers for the achievement of behtcr results from their activities. 8. Consultat,ions and conferences with institutional heads. 9. The dissemination of information to the public relative to the needs of institutions. Stimulating Public Interest 373 10. Holding regular meetings of the Commission during which discussions centered arotlnd the problems upon which the Commission members were at work. 11. Carrying on special projects and study by committees.' The most telling results of the work of the Commission have been brought about through experimentation. The programs at Elmira and Wallkill have served as irldications of the possibilites in other institutions. ,The men who were trained through these experiments have become part of the regular administrative stnff of the New York Stat,e Department of Correctlion, and in that capacity have been instrumental in carryirig to the other institu- tions the information and techniques developed in the original experiments. The Commission has made it possible for the Governor t,o includc important items in his state budget with thc assurnnre that they represented fea,tures of prison adnlinistration thnt had been proved sound by careful experiment,. Thcsc t.ions have resulted in bhc organizatiorl uf an educations1 division in thc Department of Correction, thus establishing one of thc first such divisions in the Country. The task of stimulating public opinion rests first upon an ade- quate technique of trnnsnlit'ting to a t!:n p::b!ic, a certziii iiiiiuii~li of information some of which is fairly technical. The information must be imparted a~curat~ely, fairly, and n.it.hout sensationalism. It must be information and not propaganda. It must give facts, not fancy. Tlle sensation and the fancy have been prevnlcnt enough in the press. It would seem desirable that a department of correction should have at it,s service someone competent to translate t'echnical details and statistics into the langufige of t,he nen-spnper and magazine for the enlightenment of the public. Such informatiorl could be as impartial and enlightening as that now offered by many other goverrln~ental dcpnrtmrwts. There is a tcndcncy among groups interested in a particu1:rr morement to confine t,hcir ~~riting to publications which rcarll only their own group. The taxpaying public seldom sees t.he volumin- ous reports and statist,ic:~l publications issucd in highly specialized fields. Furthermore, such reports arid publications are oftcn so technical or so ponderous, that the average man will spend neither lItcport to IIis Escellcncy Govcrnor Herbert 11. Lchman.

The average man on the street, in t,he last analysis, is the most in~portant man to reach. His information on any subject deter- niirles how he will vote. Books xvritten for public consumption are probably more impor- t,arlt avenues for general publicitmy than the more liighly tecllnical conlmittec report. The wide appeal and extensive sale of such books as \"Twcnty Years in Sing Sing\" by Karden Lawes is an csarnple of the type of publication that actually reaches the average rrndcr and creates a receptive public attitude. Notervorthy indeed is t!ie fact that the Bureau of Publicat,ions of Teachers College, Columbia T1nivcrsity, has recently issued \"The Training of Prison Gu:irds in tile State of Kew York\" by Dr. \\TTalter AT. l\\7allack; \"The Organization and Teaching of Social and Economic Studies in Correctional Institutions\" by Dr. Glenn ,lf. I(endnl1; \"Education Wallack, Ilendall and Briggs and \"The Administration of Personnel in Correctional Institutions in New York Statc\" by Dr. D. Ross Pugmire. Iiadio and mot.ion pictures dealing rrit,h prison problems have llad a tremendous public appeal, but extreme vigilance should be r)scrciscd to prevent such programs from providing incentives and i)attcr~ls to tile adolescent who may be tempted to seek either a 2 1. ..111 1111111 ui; VLJ~ IIIUIIC~. An eiiort shotlid be rnade to utiiize these fields of publicity and to create desirable public attitudes in young and oid. It often happens that in public or even private business the various activities become so highly departmentalized that one group does not know what the others are doing-and sometimes docs not care. Each works independently and conscientiously but f:iils to see thc whole picture. The result is misunderstanding, i~ieficit~ncy, and inevitably unjust criticism. This can and does occur iri penal systems. From police to tlie prosecuting attorney to t11c court to the prison to the parole officer is a cont,inuous path for any single prisoner, but for the men and women atlrniriistering them, encii of thcsc agencies is a complete ent,ity n-liich discharges its man at, t.he same time it discharges its specific duty. Coopcra- tion, coordination, continuity, understanding are necessary if the criminal is t,o be rehabilitated instead of just \"put arvsy\". So, it is highly dcsirablc that ~vherel-er there are rncetings of associa- tions of district attorneys, of justices of t,he pcace, of sheriffs, of magistrates, of police chiefs, or other public officers, there should Stimulating Public Interest 377 be discussion of the problems of the prisons and especially of the whole delinquent in the whole economic and social situation. Such wider knowledge will result not only in the saving of the man but in the protection of society itself. Public school officials are frequently in a bet'ter position to propagate accurate information relative to matters of national social significance than any other group. In fact they are under constant pressure from every type of propaganda agency, both good and bad. It is therefore important that an effort be made to keep local, state and national school groups informed in regard t,o the current objectives of correctional education. Much sig- nificance attaches to the fact that, for the past three years, the Department of Superintendence, now the American Association of School Administrators, has made provisions on it,s programs for discussions on the rcsponsibilit,y of the school man for the dclin- quent and the criminal. Last >-car, the panel disclission held in the ballroom of Haddon Hall at Atlantic City aroused much atten- tion and resulted in the request on the part of the large audicnce t,hat a similar program be held each year. On the panel were: William E. Grady, Associate Superintendent of Schools, Ke~v York City, Chairman; Janlcs ?rIarshall, President of the Sew York City Board of Education; Lewis E.

The public schools are judged largely in the light of the ilnpressions which teachers make upon people in their everyday business, civic, and social relationships. If they are prim and prosaic, they give the impression that the instruction must be old- fashioned and impractical. If they are alive, wide-awake, up-and- coming, then people are likely to feel that the work in the classroom ~ is also alive, and wide-awake and up-and-coming. The same holds !I nc of the prisons. As long as the public thinks of prison wardens .tnd guards as tough, club-swinging employees, and of prison tcachers as unsuccessful public school teachers or as smarter con- victs, then it will not conceive of the prison as an institution for rehabilitation. The entire prison personnel, in its mingling with thc gcneral public, can stimulate a wide and effective interest in t llc \\rllole problem of the prisons. The well-planned and excellently r~sccuted courses for the training of guards and the intensive up- c:rading and constructive supervision of teachers in the New York <t:ltc prisons have both been an indirect, but undoubtedly pomer- ful influence upon the public opinion. Ideally, the result of the work of a public agency will be so obvious that the public can judge for itself. Often this is vhat i,:ippens and the judgment is fair enough. Ho~vever, the work of !!ic prisons certainly does not make itself known automatically. I qnorance of modern objectives and progressive methods in prison ,I ork is not only widespread but buttressed in prejudice. The very :~nture of the institution cuts it off from society, and when the iriii~ates do come out into society they suffer from restrictions, From stigma, and from sensational publicity that readily distort :!le situation and malie a false impression upon the uninformed. 'i'hereforc, it is not only legitimate but imperative, that every :.:cans be taken to make the public conscious of what is being done .lot only for the saving of individuals but for its own protection.
