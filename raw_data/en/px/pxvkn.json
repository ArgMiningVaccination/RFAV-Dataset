Daily intake of vitamin C is essential for good health because your body doesn't produce it on it's own. - Vitamin A: Vitamin A is an infection-fighter. It helps to fight bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections. - Vitamin B6: Vital to supporting biochemical reactions in the immune system it is responsible for producing white blood cells and T cells, which regulate immune responses. It also helps the body make the protein interleukin-2 to direct white blood cell activity. - Vitamin D: One of the most important nutrients for supporting the immune system is a fat soluble nutrient that improves the white cells that defend the immune system, and decrease inflammation. - Zinc: Zinc is needed for the production of new immune system cells. It's found primarily in animal foods but can be also found in some vegetarian food like. - Vitamin E: vitamin E can be a powerful antioxidant that helps your body fight off infection. This important vitamin \u2014 part of nearly 200 biochemical reactions in your body \u2014 is critical in how your immune system functions. - Iron: Iron, which helps your body carry oxygen to cells, plays a part in many of the immune system processes. How can I boost my child's immune system naturally? The best way to ensure your [child's immune system](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-boost-your-kids-immunity-heading-into-the-new-school-year/) is ready to fight infection, it to be sure to feed them a healthy balanced diet rich in vitamins and nutrients. - Lots of Fruits, Vegetables and Nutrients: Make sure to serve your child a healthy diet with fruits and vegetables at every meal. Think of feeding them the rainbow to ensure they are getting a variety of the nutrients they need. Pairing fruits and veggies with whole grains and lean protein will help support a strong immune system as well! - Plenty of Sleep: Your child needs more sleep than you do! Help improve their sleep habits and ensure they're getting enough sleep by putting them to bed at the same time each night, and creating a relaxing evening routine to wind down from the busy day. - Exercise: Get your bodies moving with your kids. Research shows that exercise increases the number of natural killer cells! - Frequent Hand Washing: This may seem obvious, but it is often taken for granted. Make sure your child washes their hands often and thoroughly. There is no substitute for good hygiene! Does vitamin C really work to fight the common cold? When you feel the first signs of the common cold, you may reach for vitamin C in the form of orange juice, citrus fruit, or supplements. But do vitamin C supplements really work to help fight the common cold? There has been a great deal of research done around vitamin C. However, the studies done have shown inconsistent results. A [2007 study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070718002136.htm) looked at 60 years of clinical research, examining those that took 200 mg of vitamin C a day. The research showed that when taken after a cold already starts, vitamin C has no impact on the length or severity of the cold. However, when taken daily, vitamin C has a marginal effect on the length of the common cold, shortening the duration of 8% of adults, and 14% of children. This means as an adult you may suffer with the common cold for 11 days out of 12, if you take vitamin C daily, and for children this means you would have the cold for 24 days compared to 28 if you take vitamin C daily. However, other studies show that there is a more significant impact. Either way, taking vitamin C is not harmful if used in the correct dosage. It is an essential nutrient your body needs for multiple functions, and can have a moderate effect on the length of your cold and flu symptoms. Does my child also need a multivitamin? If you choose to give your child a daily dose of vitamin C, or one of the immunity fighting vitamins, you may want to consider giving your child an additional multivitamin to support their cognitive, and physical growth.
