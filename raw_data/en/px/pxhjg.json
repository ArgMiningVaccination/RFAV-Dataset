Hildegard's Original Bitters Tablets supplement the lost bitter flavor profile, abandoned in most western diets. This blend of bitter herbs, inspired by [Hildegard of Bingen](https://healthyhildegard.com/hildegard-of-bingen-biography/), helps balance the palate, while contributing to [digestive health](https://healthyhildegard.com/digestive-health-and-bitters/). Bitters awaken bitter receptors throughout the body, including the gastrointestinal tract, and even [our skin](https://healthyhildegard.com/benefits-of-bitter-for-skin-care/). For centuries monks and nuns in western Europe have used bitter herbs and roots, such as those found in [Hildegard's Original Bitters Tablets](https://eurbal.com/product/hildegards-original-bitters-tablets-natural-health-aids-eurbal/) to manage cravings during [spiritual fasting periods](https://healthyhildegard.com/spiritual-fasting/) and [intermittent fasting](https://healthyhildegard.com/intermittent-fasting-book/). Ancient Romans used a similar combination of herbs as pre-meal digestives to stimulate digestion and [manage appetite and portion control](https://healthyhildegard.com/bitter-herbs-for-appetite-control-and-digestion/). The old German adage implores: \"the less you like bitters, the more you need them!\" Why Use Bitters? We westerners generally don't like the taste of bitterness. There's an old German adage that goes: \"the less you like bitter, the more you need bitters for your health.\" So, bitters are an acquired taste. And, in the absence of bitter flavors in our diet, we often reach for a less healthy alternative - namely, sweet flavors. Hildegard would encourage us to seek balance among all tastes and flavors, recognizing that when our diet falls out of balance, we often crave the very thing that harms us the most, propelling us further out of balance! Bitters for health can greatly improve our overall well being in the following ways: About Hildegard of Bingen Hildegard of Bingen remains Germany's greatest mystic and companion to god.
