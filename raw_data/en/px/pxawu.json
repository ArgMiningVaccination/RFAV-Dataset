Discussions by artists, archivists, academics, lawyers, teachers, journalists and others. Ornamented Elephants, the Lowly Pida, and the Turbaned Man Ruminations from the margins of design Sarita Sundar in conversation Suresh https://youtube.com/BLiSCIndia Abstract: Hand in hand with the heady arrival of European Modernism in India in the mid-20th century, came minimalism. Both these movements shook and questioned an existing cultural inclination across various parts of the sub-continent toward ornamentation, embellishment and flourish. The singularity of thought and expression that is the hallmark of Modernism stands in virtual opposition to the binaries of expression manifest in Indian ways of representation. And yet, Modernism did enter the Indian landscape, most prominently through a state-sponsored drive post-Independence. And it held sway in diverse, visual expressions; in architecture, art, and design. In this conversation, Sarita Sundar speaks of the consonance in the \u00e2\u20acplayful ambiguities\u00e2\u20ac in Indian thought and aesthetic theory across the creative arts; its representations in popular and visual culture that can be found in design, folk performances, as well as political arenas. She speaks of her research in three distinct arenas: Indian typography traditions, village festivals in Kerala, and seating cultures across India. Sarita Sundar asks quite simply, whether freedom from ornament is a sign of spiritual strength; whether, for all its utopian ideals, Modernism is indeed in crisis, and if the announcement of its death was premature? Bio: Sarita Sundar\u00e2\u20acs practice and research spans heritage studies, popular and visual culture, and design theory. At Hanno, her heritage interpretation and design consultancy, she combines 30+ years of working with brand strategy and design solutions with her academic training in museum studies. Over the years, she has engaged in critical enquiries into how culture engages with the visual, ranging from research into Indian vernacular typography (Indians don\u00e2\u20act like White Space, 2015) to studies of intangible culture in performance practices (The Goddess and her Lieutenant: object systems at a village festival, 2016). Her present research focuses on seating cultures in India, in collaboration with The Godrej Archives, Mumbai. Suresh Venkat is an editorial consultant, anchor and actor.

Although 4 formulations of CAR T cells targeting CD19(+) B cell malignancy subsets are FDA approved; cytokine toxicity, off-tumor effect, autologous administration, and unaffordability limit CAR therapy in its present configuration. Modification in the receptor design or switching the chassis of CARs beyond T cells had been indicated to resolve these issues. We tested T cells expressing second-generation CARs against CD19 in conventional design, except with the hinge and transmembrane domain to indigenously generate safe and affordable CAR T cells. An alternate solution is to explore T cells owing to the HLA independent and multivalent tumor sensing capabilities. However, the heterogeneity in subsets and persistence with diminished antitumor functions of T cells limits its application in immunotherapy. Adaptive redirection with CARs was found to boost the cytotoxic potential and antitumor functions of T cells. The 'on-tumor' effect and allogeneic or 'off-the-shelf value of T cells can further complement the CAR therapy. In this context, we have streamlined the workflow for the expansion and characterization of T cells and T cells which are due to be tested against established B cell malignancies in preclinical animal models. The immune cell engineering and therapy (iCET) program, therefore, envisions generating and characterize -therapeutic immune cells redirected with multiple CAR configurations - at the cellular and molecular level. The long-term goal of iCET is clinical translation of advanced immune cell therapeutics to treat refractory or relapsed hematologic malignancies in | | |VC Link||Coordinator||Prof. Alok Srivastava| In regenerative medicine, the cell and tissue engineering are fully dependent on the utilization of stem cells, because of their functional abilities to self-renewal, differentiation conditions that lead the underpin to potential translational applications. Controlling the stem cell fate and behavior is one of the important aspects in regenerative medicine, which also needs to be fully understood to execute their potentials in clinical therapies. Moreover, the prospects of stem cell fate regulations via intracellular pathways are existing challenging features in regenerative medicine. Hence, in the last decade the use of functionalized nanostructured materials of which controlling and the use of magnetic fields as nano-instructive tools for the microscale regulations of stem cell pathways offering numerous opportunities for regulating various mechanotransduction events in stem cells via moderating the YAP/TAZ related mechanoresponsive process. However, the opportunities of modifying the nanostructured materials to stimulate specific stem cell responses are still represent the need of scientific and technological challenges. In addition to that these kinds of implantable materials could allow the stem cells and their differentiated phenotypes within the organisms upon implantation, thereby encourages the adhesion, spreading and migration of adhered stem cells via mimicking the extracellular matrix upon regulation of integrin signaling. Recent progress and advancements for the usage of magnetic nanomaterials for the tissue engineering applications includes the variety of diversified nanoscale materials surfaces that resulting in the controlling of stem cell mechanotransduction with an unprecedented functionality via application of magnetic fields as nano-switch. Hence, focusing cell engineering with diversified RGD-ligand tethered nanostructured materials could offers the novel platforms to study the cellular mechanosensing via applying the mechanical forces to single cells and multicellular biological tissue microenvironments. In this talk, I will focus about the brief outlooks on nanostructured materials on mechanotransduction pathway and their association with the conversion of mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals and to translate the proposed strategies into regenerative platforms of tissue engineering. Eventually, this nanoscale strategies will find the opportunities and advantages to mesenchymal stem cells and its application in several autologous regenerative therapies. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Transport of bio molecules within cells is important for their survival and physiological function. Bio molecular transport depends on many processes; lipids are one of the central players in these processes of transport not only as inert cargo containers but also in their capacity as signal transducers that modulate cellular transport in response to ongoing changes in the environment. Certain classes of phospholipids such as phosphoinositides (PIs), phosphatidic acid (PA) and its non-phosphorylated form diacylglycerol (DAG) are regarded as signalling lipids conveying information within cells and tuning transport to ongoing physiological needs. Signalling lipids can regulate transport by multiple mechanisms. Some act as second messengers to activate proteins that control transport, others recruit the components of transport machinery to membranes and and some by virtue of their shape (PA) assist in bending membranes during transport carrier biogenesis. Regardless of the mechanism of action, an essential requirement for a signalling lipid is a fine spatial and temporal control over its production and degradation at specific cellular membranes under defined conditions. Such control is achieved by proteins that are involved in generation or degradation of these lipids. During this thesis, I have studied the regulating of wing pattern in Drosophila through genetic modulation of the activity of enzymes that directly or indirectly control signalling lipid levels in space and time. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P)1 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bis phosphate PI(4,5)P2 are PIs that are well studied as signalling molecules 2. Using the Drosophila wing development model, we explore the potential mechanisms by which these lipids [PI4P and PI(4,5)P2] could regulate tissue patterning in the developing Drosophila wing. I will describe work that seeks to define the function of enzymes that regulate PI4P metabolism and of proteins that in turn could regulate their activity in regulating wing patterning. Overall, my results suggest a key role for PI4P levels at the plasma membrane in regulating cell viability during wing development in Drosophila3. 1. Balakrishnan, S. S. et al.

A 2-hour episode of immobilization stress is able to enhance spine density in the amygdala neurons in rats. However, this spinogenesis is observed only 10 days later and not 1 day after the acute stress exposure. Acute stress also leads to heightened anxiety-like behaviour in rats, 10 days but not 1 day later. This delayed onset of symptoms presents this acute stress paradigm as a suitable model to study how traumatic experiences can lead to development of disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after a significantly long asymptomatic period. In this thesis, we started with an in-depth study of immediate and delayed effects of acute stress across multiple levels of neural organization - from molecules and synapses, to neurons, and behavior in rats. Our key findings show that acute stress leads to increased synaptic excitation and decreased inhibition in the amygdala neurons, 10 days later. Further, both amygdalar neurons and astrocytes exhibit elevation in de novo protein synthesis at 1 hour, 1 day and 10 days after stress (2). In contrast, hippocampal protein synthesis is initially enhanced but decreases 10 days later. Next, we tested the efficacy of a pharmacological intervention that has emerged from clinical studies in patients of stress disorders. We report that administration of corticosterone in drinking water after stress prevents the effects of stress in a selective manner. Finally, most of the earlier studies used male rats, and the effects of stress on female rats remain underexplored. So, we examined sex differences in physiological and behavioral responses to acute stress. Our findings reveal that the same acute stress that causes delayed anxiogenesis and amygdalar hyperexcitability in male rats, did not lead to similar changes in the female rats (3). Together, the findings in this thesis offer a framework for analyzing how affective symptoms of stress disorders vary across biological scales in a spatio-temporal manner. This work will further help probe for sex-specific variations in cellular and molecular changes in the amygdala elicited by a brief stressor that gradually leads to amygdalar dysfunction, as well as for development of potential therapeutic interventions against it.

Gene modification of HSPCs has opened new possibilities of autologous HSPC based therapies. We use CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene modification approaches for the treatment of b-hemoglobinopathies, HIV and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. Our approaches are either to correct the underlying genetic mutation or to introduce beneficial mutation inherent in some populations. For instance, some deletional or point mutations in the b-globin cluster are shown to reactivate fetal hemoglobin and alleviate severity of sickle and b-thalassemia. In case of HIV, the CCR5-32 mutation found to protective against the infection. In this talk, I will present our approaches, proof of concept showing the generation of gene modified HSPCs at a higher frequency, functional effects achieved by the genetic change and importantly, in vivo evidence for long-term functional effect of the gene modified HSPCs. I will also discuss our plans on how to take this approach further for the clinical studies. | | |VC Link||Coordinator||Prof. Alok Srivastava| Lipid mediated nucleic acid delivery has made a significant impact on public health applications including rapid development of lipid enabled mRNA vaccines for COVID19 to siRNA based therapeutics for rare diseases including ONPATTRO for amyloidosis and GIVLAARI for acute hepatic porphyria. In similar lines, our lab is focused on developing novel lipid nanoparticle systems for multiple therapeutic applications including protein replacement therapy, mRNA based vaccines and delivering gene editing tools. In this talk, I will be presenting critical aspects of lipid nanoparticle design for efficient nucleic acid delivery towards developing in vivo nucleic acid therapies. This includes development of galactosylated lipid nanoparticle system for targeting hepatocytes as a platform technology to treat monogenic liver disorders such as Hemophilia and our efforts towards developing a lipid encapsulated mRNA based vaccine for COVID19. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| All species are subject to ecological change in their environment. The central role of genetic adaptation in population persistence in novel environments has long been appreciated. However, the extent of phenotypic contributions to adaptive population dynamics is generally underexplored, especially following environmental stress, an increasingly relevant concern in our current global context. In my thesis, I explore how different phenotypic trait values (both genetically and environmentally-determined) contribute to fitness and population performance in novel habitats using a cosmopolitan generalist species as a study system. Empirically quantifying phenotypic contributions to adaptation and population dynamics in a novel environment is a substantial challenge since it is difficult to obtain detailed long-term time series after an environmental change. In this talk, I will present a part of my thesis that explores how genetic adaptation acts through environmentally-determined fitness-related phenotypes to influence population persistence in novel environments. I will focus on a special case of extreme environmental challenge to the population. Following a suboptimal environmental change, populations typically decline rapidly and are under threat of extinction. Evolutionary rescue occurs if the populations persist and subsequently adapt to the novel environment. The hallmark of evolutionary rescue is a U-shaped time-series of population size that represents the stark decline, bottleneck and subsequent adaptation. Populations with higher standing genetic variation are more likely to undergo evolutionary rescue. However, it is not yet known whether pre-existing variation in different phenotypic traits aids evolutionary rescue, and which specific traits matter. Additionally, it is important to separate the contribution of phenotypic variation in founding (colonizing) individuals vs. their offspring, because phenotypic trait values may change due to single-generation mortality or plastic responses to the new environment. What are the resulting impacts on population performance during evolutionary rescue? To answer these questions, I used a combination of lab-based fitness assays and experimental evolution in a generalist pest species, Tribolium castaneum. I found that population dynamics in a highly suboptimal resource (corn flour) were consistent with the U-shaped trajectory associated with evolutionary rescue. Additionally, population performance in the highly suboptimal corn was correlated with different ancestral phenotypes of the founders and their offspring. In particular, high ancestral development rate of the founding individuals and high reproductive fitness of their offspring may aid evolutionary rescue by increasing population size, the effects of which last up to as long as 40 generations. These results indicate that most populations in a highly stressful environment may be rescued by fast turnover in the population via rapid development and high reproductive fitness. Together, these results highlight the importance of identifying specific fitness components that may enable population persistence in rapidly deteriorating environments. In particular, conservation and pest management decisions may be greatly aided by identifying key phenotypic, demographic and environmental correlates of evolutionary rescue. In my talk, I will summarise some key aspects of what drives and hinders adaptation and evolutionary rescue in new habitats. | | |VC Link||Coordinator||Prof. Alok Srivastava| Cell and gene therapies are a niche product area but presently with limited manufacturing capacity. At CSCR, diligently working towards Affordable excellence in the AAV gene therapy program through process development for AAV vector production by collaborative efforts with AAV gene therapy field experts and industry partner. AAV is the popular gene therapy vector for medical applications because of its clinically proven track record of safety and efficacy. AAV is used as a gene therapy vector because of its non-pathogenic nature and transduces both dividing and non-dividing cells. Hemophilia B is an ideal target for AAV-based gene therapy since the human factor IX gene can be accommodated in AAV gene therapy drug products for successful clinical application. Proof-of-concept (POC) study in Factor IX null mouse corrected the phenotype and established safety and efficacy of AAV8-hFIX-Padua vector in this preclinical study. Tox studies are ongoing for this gene therapy drug product, leading to future Phase-I / Phase-II clinical trials on hemophilia B patients after screening for AAV8 pre-existing antibodies. We will also discuss organized plans and formulated strategies for AAV3-hFIX-Padua-based AAV3 vector production to treat patients with hemophilia B. Part II of the talk will focus on cell therapy-based research and potential product development. The human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) / hMSCs-derived exosomes, as a product, fall under the stringent quality control requirements. These include validated measurements of purity, potency, efficacy, and stability. Each cell type has different properties. The mechanism for their therapeutic influence on tissue homeostasis in vivo is frequently unclear and primarily attributed to paracrine factors and other MSCs-derived factors influencing the homed tissue microenvironment. In this context, we will discuss cell therapy approaches, which may help retain stem cells' intrinsic properties and testing the regenerative potential of MSCs-based therapy in preclinical mice models. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Serotonin is most popularly known as a neurotransmitter; thus, it was surprising to find elevated levels of serotonin in stem cell and early progenitor populations (stem cells) of planaria Schmidtea mediterranea when compared to differentiated cell populations in our preliminary exploratory experiments. Since planaria can survive months of period without any feeding and without losing its regeneration ability, it is well-suited to study the effect of such small metabolites, where there is no sudden, large metabolic change due to maintenance activity like feeding and alike. On probing the relative levels of metabolites in stem cells, progenitors, and differentiated cells using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based quantitative metabolomics, we find tryptophan and its metabolic product serotonin significantly and unexpectedly enriched in stem cells and progenitor population. Next, with dsRNAi mediated knockdown, we observe that knockdown of a previously unreported allele of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene leads to an unexpected photoreceptor less like phenotype. We uncover co-loc of stem cell and pah gene markers during photoreceptor regeneration. Upon further studies, we suspect the role of metabolite/neurotransmitter serotonin mediated post-translational modification 'serotonylation' of key proteins in the decision making of stem cells differentiation into photoreceptor cells.
