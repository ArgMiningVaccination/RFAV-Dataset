Bordetella bronchiseptica is an airborne bacteria that's the most common cause of kennel cough in dogs. It's an upper respiratory tract infection much like the common cold in people. It's self-limiting and will usually resolve on its own. It's now formally known as canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD). Many other viruses and bacteria can also lead to kennel cough ... these include canine parainfluenza, canine adenovirus and canine distemper. Kennel cough is highly contagious so you need to keep your dog away from other dogs while he has symptoms. How Do Dogs Get Kennel Cough? The main reason dogs get kennel cough is a weakened immune system that doesn't fight off infection when your dog's exposed to certain bacteria or viruses. Outbreaks are common in shelter or boarding environments that are moist and warm, with poor ventilation, and infected dogs coming and going. But a romp in the park, a visit to the vet's office where there's been an infection, or a quick meeting with an infected dog on the street is enough to transmit the disease. After exposure, your dog will show signs any time from 2 to 10 days. Once you spot kennel cough symptoms, your dog is contagious and can easily spread kennel cough to other dogs.
