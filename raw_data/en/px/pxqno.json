The Vis, which may also be understood as chi or prana, is our bodies', our communities', and nature's vital force has away of bringing itself into balance and wellness. Your symptoms or illness is one of the ways that the Vis communicates that you are out of balance, and creates an opportunity for you to learn from your body, be well, and heal. Inciting healing, balance, and wellness are fundamental to the therapeutic relationship in naturopathic medicine. We do this, not just by addressing your physical health, but your mental, emotional, and spiritual health, and begin to uncover the underlying cause of your symptoms or illness. We work together to remove the obstacles to your healing process with compassion, humor, education, and a number of supportive therapies. Naturopathic doctors(ND) are licensed in 17 states, across Canada, and Europe. Laws are different depending on where you live, but you want to look for your ND tohave a doctorate from a certified naturopathic university, not an online diploma mill. The 4-6 year program is rigorous and in line with medical training across the United States. All students coming into the program must have a pre-med or all sicence prerequisits finished, and acceptance and admission into the program is competitive and challenging. Exams are done after the first two years to enter clinical training, and all physicians must pass the state board exams to obtain licensing. Residencies are not required to practice, but many doctors go on into the few residencies that are available and growing. It is a difficult and rewarding program with a wide scope of practice in the medical field. Naturopathic doctors in Washington state have a doctorate in Naturopathic medicine obtained from a certified naturopathic university. They are trained as primary care physicians and have medication prescriptive rights, and well as insurance recognition. Yearly physicals, exams, and imaging can all be done and ordered through your naturopathic doctor. Therapeutic modalities that we utilize include botanical medicine, homeopathy, therapeutic nutrition and food-as-medicine, supplementation, therapeutic exercise, hydrotherapy, osseous manipulation, craniosacral therapy, and counseling. If you ever wanted your doctor to spend more time with you, listening to your concerns, and looking for the root cause of your health challenges, then a Naturopathic doctor is who you are looking for. Here at Sky Valley Healing Arts we treat a variety of conditions, including digestive issues, allergies, autoimmune disease, endocrine disorders, environmental toxicity, cardiovascular, neurological disorders, and head injury.

Naturopathic medicine principles The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae) The healing power of nature is the inherent self-organizing and healing process of living systems. Naturopathic medicine recognizes this healing process to be ordered and intelligent. It is the naturopathic physician's role to support, facilitate and augment this process by identifying and removing obstacles to health and recovery, and by supporting the creation of a healthy internal and external environment. Find The Cause (Tolle Causam) Every illness has an underlying cause, often in aspects of the lifestyle, diet or habits of the individual. A naturopathic physician is trained to find and remove the underlying cause of a disease. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere) Naturopathic physicians utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful effects, and apply the least possible force or intervention necessary to diagnose illness and restore health. Whenever possible the suppression of symptoms is avoided as suppression generally interferes with the healing process. Treat The Whole Person Health or disease comes from a complex interaction of mental, emotional, spiritual, physical, dietary, genetic, environmental, lifestyle, and other factors. Naturopathic physicians treat the whole person, taking these factors into account. Preventive Medicine The naturopathic approach to health care can prevent minor illnesses from developing into more serious diseases. Patients are taught the principles with which to live a healthy life and by following these principles, they can prevent major illnesses. Wellness Establishing and maintaining optimum health and balance. Wellness is a state of being healthy, characterized by positive emotion, thought, and action. Wellness is inherent in everyone no matter what dis-ease(s) are being experienced. If wellness is really recognized and experienced by an individual, it will more quickly heal a given dis-ease than direct treatment of the dis-ease alone. Doctor as Teacher (Docere) The original meaning of the word \"doctor\" is teacher. A principal objective of naturopathic medicine is to educate the patient and emphasize self-responsibility for health. Naturopathic physicians also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. "}
