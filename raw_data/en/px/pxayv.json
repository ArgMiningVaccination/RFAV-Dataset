According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 1 million people have died from COVID-19 in the United States. Although the federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergecy declaration ended on May 11, 2023, actions to protect those at highest risk of severe COVID-19 are still critically important. Stay Home if Sick If you feel sick and have any of the following symptoms stay home and get tested: - Cough - Fever - Sore throat - Vomiting - Diarrhea Testing & Treatment If you are symptomatic or exposed to someone with COVID-19, it is important to choose the right type of test for your circumstance. There are two types of test: PCR and Antigen.

Exposure & Masking Guidelines If you test positive for COVID-19 or have had close contact with an individual who has COVID-19, it is important to take the appropriate precautions to prevent spreading it to others. COVID-19 is highly contagious. Recommendations from the CDC include isolation and masking. Wearing a well-fitting mask consistently and correctly can prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. If you have been exposed to COVID-19 you should also wear a well-fitting mask around others for 10 days from your last exposure, regardless of vaccination status or history of prior infection. It is important to support those within our community who choose to wear a protective facial mask in public areas. Masking is a personal choice. COVID Check App Students in UC housing are required, and students living off-campus along with faculty and staff are highly encouraged to report via the Covid Check App if they test positive for COVID-19, develop viral symptoms, or have a known exposure to a COVID-positive person. The UC COVID Check App can be downloaded for free in your app store.
