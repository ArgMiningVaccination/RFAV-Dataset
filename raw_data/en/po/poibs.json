Within the last 15 years we've found a variety of techniques that actually make a difference. Hear what others have to have to say about their experiences below: \"I developed neuropathy in my feet and legs. It was limiting my balance, activities I could do, and nervous system. I would have to take my shoes off to feel the pedals while driving. Dr. Smart got my circulation going and adjusted my feet, hips, and legs and and now all that is gone. I've got a lot more confidence in life.\" Hugh Every great dream begins with a dreamer. You have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world. -Harriet Tubman At Smart Energy Healing we understand what it's like to try a million things to feel healthy without seeing results. The root cause of your pain must be uncovered to make it possible for your body to heal. That's why we offer a blend of Chiropractic, Nutritional Therapy, Functional Neurology, along with Energy and Emotion Clearing. We've seen our patients heal and get their lives back over and over again with this approach. We recommend you begin with meeting Tracy. She can determine the treatments you need specifically and is able to identify stressors, foods, and nutrient deficiencies that may be holding you back. Once your plan is created, we'll begin addressing the imbalances in your structural, emotional, and physiological body to get you on the path to healing. After following our recommendations, and receiving treatment, you'll feel and see major shifts happening in your body and mind that make you feel like YOU again. "}
