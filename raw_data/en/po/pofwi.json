The program is based on the workof Capacitar International whose vision is \"healing ourselves and healing our world.\" Capacitar for Kids grew out of a desire to offer wellness practices to children, especiallythose caught in the cycle of violence andtrauma in many of our local neighborhoods. Too often child ren are the unseen and unheard victims of the choices of the adultsin their lives. We wanted to bring health andwell-being to the lives of children, their fam-ilies, schools and communities. We thoughtthat simple wellness practices could serve asvaluable tools to help child ren heal an d transform the stress and violence of theirlives so that they could better learn andgrow as healthy and whole persons. Since our founding in 1988, Capacitar hasworked with children and families in local andinternational communities. Capacitar is a Spanish word meaning \"to empower, to encourage, to bring each other to life.\"Using popular education methods, Capacitarteach es healing, team building and self- developm ent, giving people tools for them- selves, their families and their communities.Capacitar en deavors to awaken people to their own source of strength and wisdom so they can reach out to heal injustice andviolence and create a more peaceful world.Capacitar currently works in 26 countries on five continents. With escalating globalviolence, there has been a growing interestin usin gCapacitar practices with children in schools in the United States, as well as inother areas o fthe world.Capacitar for Kids offers students, parentsand teachers simple wellness practices foruse in the classroom, in daily life and in thehome. The practices and methods describedin this manual have been field-tested byCapacitar International with many differentcultures and socioeconomic groups. A three-year pilot program began at St. JosephSchool and Holy Family School in Cincinnati,Ohio, in August 2003 with the financial sup- port o fCatholi cHealth Initiatives and the Good Samaritan Hospital Foundation. This manual is offered as a resource for teachers andfamilies and can be used with or without formal training. The wellness practices can be incorpor ated within th ecurriculum an dsubject areas, and as part of the daily routine in theclassroom, on the playground or at home. Thelanguage and method of presenting the practices can be readily adapted to gradelevel, culture and subject area. The manualprovides Suggestions for Teachers and identifiesCapacitar Core Practices in each section. Often children come to school distracted\u2014 not able to con centrate an dlearn. Section 1 offers practices such as breathwork, visualiza-tion an d cross-lateral exercises to improve mental focus, concentration and learning. For many cultures of the world, health is a dynamic state of balance and energy flow within theperson an dwith the environment. Section 2 discusses a holistic understanding of health andwell-bein gbased on en ergy.Through m ovement exercises such as Tai Chi and the Salute to theSun, child ren work with their en ergy flow to promote a feeling of well-being and renewedvitality. By holding their fingers, children learnIntroduction and Overview of the ProgramCapacitar for Kids 7Introduction and Overview of the Program to release emotional pain and manage the overwhelming energies of strong feelings. Section 3 addresses the health of the body through tr aditional and modern practices. The ancient exercise Pal Dan Gum brings balance and healing to the body's organs and systems.With acupressure children learn simple ways toalleviate minor aches and pains such asheadache, upset stomach and nausea. Otherpractices, such as pain drain, massage, and theimmune system boost, give children tools fordaily self-care to promote good physical health. Besides developing IQ, the intellectual and cognitive skills, schools also play a key role in developing EQ, the emotional literacy ofchildren. and acupressure\u2014to help childrenidentify feelings, manage strong emotions, andrelease traumatic memories and stressful states. Section 5 looks at the spiritual nature of chil- dren, o fferingsimple pr actices in min dfulness , m editation, prayer and ritual. With these tools children are able to develop a spiritual prac- tice and nurture their spirits on a daily basis. Many children are affected by daily violence and stress from home, the playground, the com-munity or the media. Section 6 offers several methods to work with tr aumati cstress , teaching children to care for themselves and to createstrong boundaries and a sense of inner safety. To help teachers and administrators better use the Capacitar practices, Appendix I offers aCourse o f Stu dy that presents objectives for each pr actice. It includes suggested subject areas for teaching each practice and appro-priate gr adelevels for accomplishing each objective, to provide for planning and evalu-ation so that the material can be integratedinto thecurriculum. A ddition al teacher resources and children's books are listedafter the Course of Study.Through this manual and the Capacitar forKids program, Capacitar endeavors to: Support the learning process in the class- room through practices promoting health and well-being. Develop within children their emotional intel- ligence and awaken their inner wisdom of body, mind and spirit. Promote positive, healthy attitudes in the person, the family and the community.Heal physical and emotional symptoms related to traumatic stress.Transform patterns of violence in the individual, the community and the society.At atime ofglobal tr aumaand violence, it is our hope that Capacitar for Kids can bring hope and healing not only to the local community,but also to the larger world. We envision anever-growing circle of solidarity\u2014children,families, schools, teachers and communities\u2014all joined han din hand , healingourselves and bringin our world. Mary Duennes, M.A.Capacitar for Kids Program Director June 2005 \"Aschildren grow and mature, an important aspect of the learning process is the development of the different ways of knowing \u2014 cognitive,intuitive ,kinesthetic, proprioceptive, emotional and spiritual.\" 8Capacitar for Ki dsCapacitar for Kids 9One of the primary goals of education is the formation of the whole person, alive to all capacities of body,mind and spirit. Dr. Richard Moss, M.D., describes this in th e followin gway: \"Wh oleness is th e key to aliveness. It is more than just physical vitality; it is radiance, coming from being one with yourself and your experience. Life then flows through you and radiates from you.\" Psychologist Aminah Raheem, Ph.D. says: \"If I were living from the whole of me, what would I be like? Awakening in body, mind, emotions and soulbrings us to wholeness. It is a learning process of recovering the soul, ofliberating the body and consciousness to follow its destiny.\" Aschildr en grow an dmature, an important aspect of the learning process is the development of the different ways of knowing\u2014cognitive, intuitive, kinesthetic, proprioceptive, emotional and spiritual. TheCapacitar practices in this section develop these channels or ways of knowin gto promote effective learning. Breathwork, centering, meditation and acupressure help to focus and clear the mind. Visualization, work with safe space and the imagination develop the intuitive and spiritual capacities.Cross-laterals and head-neck exercises open the kinesthetic and propriocep-tive capacities and improve brain function. When children are able to access and use these different ways of knowing, learning becom es a wonderful adventure and each experience an opportunity for growth. Sources Moss, Richard.

Soul Return: Integrating Body ,Psyche & Spirit .Fairfield ,CT: Aslan Publishin g, 1990.Section 1 Wellness Practices to Improve Learning and Mental FocusEnergy and Health Harmony in body, mind and spirit is essential to the learning process and to the healthy growth of children. Some stress is also an important compo-nent for learning, offering challenges that can result in growth, creativityand the development of talents. However, if stress is overwhelming, as inthe case of trauma and violence, children are unable to focus and learneffectively. Recent research has shown that normal brain development isimpaired when children are continuously exposed to overwhelming stress,trauma and violence. Current science, as well as ancient cultures of the world, recognizes that we are remarkable systems of energy in constant flow, interaction and bal-ance. People from Asian, African and indigenous cultures (more than half of the world's population) use energy as the basis of their healing meth-ods. In this worldview, health is defined as a dynamic state when energy is flowing in harmony within the whole system and with the environment.When energy is out of balance or is blocked, the result can be physicalpain, mental confusion or emotional instability. TheCapacitar pr actices in this section awaken children with an under- standing and appreciation of their energy system. With breathwork and visualization, they are able to experience their energy state and work withreleasing, harmonizing and balancing energy to better focus and learn.With the safe space and centering exercises, children can develop the fundamental connection with their true selves and with the core energy of their center. Cross-lateral exercises energize children as well as bringbalance to th eleft an drightsides ofthebrain. An dacupressure points andhead-neck exercises unblock and stimulate energy flow to the head andbrain, helping children to feel alert, alive and focused, able to think creatively and rationally. Breathwork Breath is the source of life, bringing fresh energy into the tissues and cellsto nourish body, mind and spirit. When we exhale, we release accumulatedstress an dtoxins .Breathing through a stressful time is an effective way to let go of the tension that accumulates in the body. A few long deepbreaths at a difficult moment can completely change the way we handle asituation. The breathing pattern shifts when different emotions arise.Through conscious breathing, we can become aware of the flow of theseemotions. By changing the way we breathe, we can change emotional andphysical states. Feelings and emotions can be released and cleared out of thebodyby workin gwith the breath. The followin gbreathin gexercises can be taught to children in the class- room to consciously unblock, move, balance and increase energy. Thebreathwork combined with images of light, nature or beautiful flowershelps children to feel peaceful, calm and focused. Language can be adaptedto the grade level and vocabulary of the children. 10 Capacitar f or KidsBreathwork Children often hold their breath or breathe in ashallow way. T o help them learn abdominal breathing,have the children placetheir hands below thenavel and lean f orward in their chairs. Then leadthem in breathing slowlythrough the nose andexhaling through the mouth. In this bent posi - tion, the only way theycan breathe is abdominally.After a few minutes, havethe children straighten upin the chair and continueto breathe deeply into theabdomen. In tense or difficult moments in the classroom,remind the children tobreathe deeply, imaginingthat the feelings can movethrough them and out intothe earth.Suggestions for TeachersCapacitar for Kids 11Abdominal Breathing Sit comfortably supported in a chair and close your eyes.Breath e deeply and center yourself in the moment, letting go of all worries and concerns. Place your hands on yourabdomen, breathe in deeply through your nose, and imaginethe air moving down through the body into your center withinyour abdomen. Imagine that your abdomen fills with air as if itwere a balloon. Hold your breath for a few moments and thenexhale slowly through your mouth, contracting the muscles ofyour abdomen, letting go of all the tension in your body.Continue abdominal breathing for several minutes. If unwantedthoughts come into your mind, gently release them and returnto the image of the air moving in and out of your body. Breathing in Natur e T rees and nature are tremendous sources of energy for ground- ing an d healing us. Remove your shoes, placing your feet on the ground (or imagine doing so). Breathe in deeply, imaging that your feet are like the roots of a tree running into theearth. Br eathein theearth's energy through your feet, dpain. Alternate Nostril BreathingAltern ate nostril br eathin g is a powerful practice from India that is used to circulate and balance energy. This breathing exercise is used with studentsin many Indian schools before studying or testing to balance the left andright sides of the brain\u2014the rational and the creative capacities. Alternatenostril breathing helps to release anger and strong emotions and to bringclarity an dcalm to the body, mind and spirit of the person. The exercise should be discontinued if dizziness is experienced. Sit comfortably with your back supported and your feet touching the ground.You will be usin gyour right hand during this exercise. You may close your eyes. With your right thumb at the side of the nose, gently shut off yourright nostril. Br eathedeeply through your left nostril to a count of 8. Hold your breath for a count of 4 (or 8). Then release your right nostril, place yourindex and/or middle finger over your left nostril, while exhaling through yourright nostril to a count of 8. Hold for a count of 4 (or 8) and breathe inthrough your right nostril to a count of 8. Hold the air, release your left nos-tril, and place your right thumb over the right nostril while exhaling throughthe left side. Inhale through the left nostril and hold for a count of 4 (or 8).With in dex and/or middle fingers, shut off the left nostril and exhale through the right. Continue this alternate breathing pattern for several minutes. When you are finished, open your eyes and breathe normally. Observe any changes you feel in your body. If you are unable to sleep at night, this isan excellen t practice to discharg ethefeelings and tensions of the day. This is also a very effective practice to balance and harmonize strong emotions.Section 1 Wellness Practices to Improve Learning and Mental Focus Breathing exercises combined with images o ftrees and nature help children to feelpeaceful, calm and f ocused.CORE PRACTICE: Visualization, Safe Space and Centering Visualization or guided imagery is a powerful practice that focuses the mind on healing images to bring about physiological changes in the body,mind and spirit. Through the conscious creation of peaceful images orthoughts, many positive outcomes can result, including the healing of dis-ease, alleviation of physical and emotional pain, elimination of traumaticstress symptoms, and change in behavioral patterns. The power of visuali-zation has been recognized in many cultures throughout the ages, and it isnow effectively used to lower blood pressure, treat cancer patients, pro-mote the healing process after surgery, alleviate pain, improve stamina,and enhance performance of athletes and artists. Visualization used with children in the classroom helps them to develop and focus their active im aginati on. Gui ded imagery planned as part of subject areas or daily lessons can stimulate creative and intuitive thinking. The SafeandSacred Space visualization develops the capacities for safety, trust and asense ofsecurity .Images of boundaries and protection can also be created through visualization. With breathwork and the image of an inner refuge,children can develop the skill of centering and focusing themselves. Images to Use with VisualizationThe followin gimag es may be used as part of a guided visu- alizati on for childr en. Visit a forest or a meadow filled with plants, flowers and animals. Feel deeply connected with nature and the healing power o ftheearth. Travel to the ocean or to a river. Enter the water and swim or float freely. Imagine any negative feelings or expe-riences leaving your body, floating away in the warm water. Follow a path in the open country and come to a door or agate.Open the door or gate and enter into a wonderful new world to enjoy. What is it like for you? Imagine a person or saint of great wisdom and love appearin gbeforeyou. Talk with this person an dask th em to give you an important message or gift for your life.Imagin ean animal o fgreat wisdom an dpower appearing before you. Talk with this animal. Ask this animal to tell you an important message of wisdom for your life. Remember a moment or an experience of joy or happiness in your life. Fill yourself with the energy, vitality and hap- piness that you felt at that m oment. 12 Capacitar f or Kids Visualization helps focus the mind on healing images .Natur eimages such as a meadow filled with flowers or plants maybe used as part o f aguided visualization for children.Section 1 Wellness Practices to Improve Learning and Mental Focus Capacitar for Kids 13The Safe and Sacred Space One of the most important visualizations is the Safe and Sacred Space. Eachchild can im agin e a place they consider to be their refuge\u2014a garden, the beach, the mountains, a waterfall or stream, a chapel, their bedroom or a placeimportant to childhood. Pictures or postcards can be brought to the classroomto help children create images of the place they choose for their safe space.Teachers can also invite children to draw their safe space, putting into it allthe elements that are important to help them feel safe, secure and happy. The following visualization may be tape-recorded with soft music and the language adapted for use with different grade levels or groups. Read thevisualization slowly in a soft tone of voice, taking plenty of time for eachpart. The first part of the visualization involves the complete relaxation ofthebody. The second part is an interior journey to the Safe and Sacred Space. A visit with a wise guide may also be added at this time. The thirdpart consists o f acomplete return to the body, to present time. The part for relaxati on ofthe body may be shortened because of time constraints. After the visualization children can be invited to write about or draw a picture ofthe experience or to share the experience with someone in the class. Part 1\u2014Body Scan and Relaxation Take acomfortable position, close your eyes an d br eathe deeply. Let go of all theconcern s ofthe day and be present in the moment. Feel your con- nection with the earth. Imagine the energy of the earth flowing upthrough your feet and throughout your entire body. You will now go on ajourney through your body, letting go of any tension, and relaxing each part completely. Connect with your toes, feet, ankles and legs. Stretch andflex them, getting in touch with any tension you may feel there. Breathedeeply and as you exhale, let go completely, releasing all the tension inyour toes, feet, ankles and legs. Feel deep peace and tranquility in all partsof your being. Breathe deeply again. Imagine the energy of the earth flowing up into the trunk of your body, moving through your pelvis, abdomen, stomach and chest, circu- latingup your back an dspinal cord to your shoulders. Stretch and flex the mus- cles of your trunk, abdomen, back and shoulders. Breathe deeply and as youexhale,let gocompletely , releasing all the tension in your abdomen and stom- ach (very relaxed), and in your chest, back, spinal column and shoulders (verysoft and relaxed). Feel deep peace and tranquility in all parts of your being. Breathe deeply again and imagine the energy of the earth moving up into your arms, elbows, forearms, hands and fingers.

Breathe deeply and as you exhale, let go completely, releasing all the tension in your arms, elbows and forearms(very soft an d relaxed), and then in your wrists, hands, palms and fingers (very soft and relaxed). Feel deep peace in all parts of your being. Pictur es or postcar ds may be brought into the classroom to helpchildren create images of the place they choosefor their safe space.14 Capacitar f or KidsBreathe deeply again and now imagine the energy of the earth moving up into your neck and head. Scan your neck and head to get in touch with any tensionyou may feel there. Gently flex the muscles in your neck. Open your mouth in awide yawn, flexing your tongue and jaw, letting go of all the tension and feelingscaught there. Make a grimace and flex all the muscles in your cheeks and fore-head, and around your eyes. Breathe deeply and as you exhale, let go completely,releasing all the tension in your neck (very soft and relaxed), your tongue, jawand cheeks (very relaxed), and your forehead, eyes, ears and scalp (very soft andrelaxed). Feel deep peace and tranquility in all parts of your being.

Breathe deeply and now let gocompletely. In all parts of your body you feel deep peace, calm and tranquility. Part 2\u2014Journey to the Safe and Sacred Space Imagin ethat you ar estartin gon a journey to a very special place .This is your inn er r efuge, your Safe and Sacred Space where only you can enter. Take time to journey to this place and to discover your special refuge. What is your safe space like? Perhaps it is a garden, full of flowers and beautiful trees. Or maybe your refuge is in the mountains by a lake or in a meadow withclear blue skies and passing clouds. Or perhaps your safe space is in a chapel orhouse from your childhood. Decide now where you will go to be in your safe andsacred space . Take some time to explore and create this place, filling it with all that will support an d nourish you. Ar etherecolors, sounds, smells or textures that you are aware of? How do you feel in this place? What is it like for you?Take some time now to enjoy your special place. Feel very safe, secure andpeaceful. Fill yourself with great peace and a deep sense of security. Take timeto open yourself to receive whatever you may need at this moment. Take a few more moments enjoying your refuge of peace. You might want to look around for some image that you can bring back with you to remindyou of your refuge. And when you feel ready, say goodbye to your safespace, knowing that you can return here whenever you desire. Part 3\u2014Return to the Present Moment Begin now to return to your body. Breathe deeply and feel the energy of yourfeet an d toes . Stretch and flex your feet and toes. Breathe deeply. Stretch and flex your legs, feeling the energy flowing fully throughout your body.

Breathe deeply and when you ar e ready,open your eyes and feel very alive and relaxed, present in the moment and in this room. Feel very peaceful and tranquil in all of your being.Take afew m oments in silence to reflect on your visit to your safe space. One child's safe space might be a mountain lakewherethe family v acations.Section 1 Wellness Practices to Improve Learning and Mental Focus Capacitar for Kids 15You might want to write about your safe space or draw your experience. Or you might want to share this with a friend. Visualization: The Wise Guide (The following visualization may be included with the visit to the The Safeand Sacr ed Space, or it may be practiced by itself.) Enjoy your safe space for a few moments. When you are ready, invite a specialperson\u2014a wise guide\u2014to join you. Your wise guide may be a person impor-tant to your life, a guide or mentor who has wisdom to share with you.Perhaps this person is a friend, a grandparent, a sister or brother, a saint, aholy person or a model for you. Invite this person to your safe space andenjoy a few moments with them. What are they like? How do you feel in theirpresence? What is it like to just sit quietly without speaking with them? Takesome time with them. Ask this person if they have any special words of wis-dom to shar ewith you. Do you have an yquestion s for them concerning your life? Take a moment to listen to what your heart needs. Imagine that this person gives you a gift or some special symbol that is significan tfor your life. What is that like for you? Receive this gift with joy, love and gratitude. Take a few moments more with this special person. When you are ready, thank them and say goodbye. Your guide is alwayswithin you. You can always return to your safe space to seek their counselandcompanionship. Take a few moments alone again in your refuge. Feel thewarmth an dlove that surrounds you. Know that you are able to return to this place wh enever you d esire.Andwhen you feel ready, say goodbye to your Safe and Sacred Space and begin to return to the present moment. Return to your Safe Space You can return at will to your safe space during the day to take a mini-vacati on when you ar etired , stressed or need a place of security. This is a skill that you can practice daily or more frequently to help you be morepeaceful and relaxed. Be seated comfortably, and breathe deeply with the intention of going to your special place. Remember the image or symbol you took from yoursacred place. This can be a key to your return. Close your eyes, and remem- ber now th eimage or symbol. Breathe deeply, flex and move your arms and legs to connect with the body and release tension, and then move into thesafe space for a few m oments .Return to the refuge of your soul, enjoying the colors, sounds, fragrances and textures of your safe space. Once againfeel deep peace and relaxation. Enjoy fully this place for a few moments. After a couple of minutes, when you are ready to leave your refuge, begin to return to the present moment. Flex your arms, hands and legs to recon-nect fully with the body. Breathe deeply and open your eyes. Feel deeppeace an dwholeness throughout your body, mind and spirit. Another person's refuge might be in a chapel orhouse from childhood.Centering Once the safe space skill has been developed with children, the concept ofcenterin g in a peaceful place within themselves becomes very natural. Use breathwork or abdominal breathing to connect with the center. To furtherhelp their focus and concentration, the children can be seated with crossedankles and with their fingertips together ( Figure 1.1 ). Or they can rest their han ds lightly on their abdomen, imagining that they can feel their breath going into a center within their abdomen. Be seated in a comfortable posi-tion, breathe fully and slowly, andimagine that you are able tobreathe in and rest in your safespace deep within yourself. Restwithin your center and feel a deepsense of peace and relaxation.Enjoy this place for a fewmoments, fully alive to yourself,focused and aware of all that ishappenin garound you. Centering is an important skill forchildren to use before taking a testor speaking in front of the class, orfor athletes when playing differentsports. Considerations When Using Visualization with Childr en For som e children who have suf- fered overwhelmin g tr auma, their experience upon closing theireyes may be on eof fear. Others have inner images of terrorbecause o fliving most oftheir lives in places of violence. Tohelp children regain a healthysense of imagination and innerimagery, use pictures or postcardsof nature, flowers, mountains,trees or the ocean to create ahealing place of their liking. Somechildr en have a har dtime deciding where to go for their safespace and keep changing placesduring thevisualizati on. If that is the case, you can experiment by 16 Capacitar f or Kids Figure1.1 CenteringSection 1 Wellness Practices to Improve Learning and Mental Focus Capacitar for Kids 17using the same refuge for the entire group to give children a similar experi- ence. For example, enter a safe space that is a beautiful garden, full oftrees and flowers. The sun shines overhead, and the birds are singing, etc.Describe in great detail the colors, textures and sounds in the garden. At times there are children in the group who, for their own safety, fre- quently dissociate and live outside their bodies, or who live in a constantfantasy or dream world. To help them be more grounded, you can suggestthat they raise their hands above their heads and gently take hold of theirspirit hovering over their body. Then invite them to pull their spirit backdown into their physical body. Each child will have a different experience with visualization. Some have very vivid imaginations and can see great details, colors, sounds and odors.Others will hear inner messages or have inner sensations. Some participantswill experience only light or darkness, or perhaps nothing, during the visual-ization. If that is the case, reassure the participants that each person usesdifferent ways of perception, and that they need not feel bad if they do nothave a colorful e xperience .The most importan tresult of the visualization is adeep sense of peace and relaxation. Once in a while d uringthe visualization, some painful memories may arise. At the end of the session, always say to the group that if anyonehad a difficult experience and feels a strong emotion or fear, they shouldtalk with the teacher or with someone in whom they can confide. If theychoose to talk with you, you can return them to their safe space to workthrough th edifficult experience so that their inner space can truly be one ofpeace an dsecurity . Thefollowing guidelines may helpful when leading visualization in the classroom: Voice quality an dtimingshould be slow and tranquil to permit the unfolding of the visualization process of the child.The environment for the visualization process should be considered\u2014 room temperature, outside noise, odors, contamination or the energy of the room. Soft music can be helpful to create a healing environment. In thevisualization, use all the senses: sound, smell, taste, touch, sight and inner messages.It is essential to re-establish a connection with the body at the end of the visualization to help the child feel grounded and connected. Breathing deeply an dstretchin gdifferen tparts o fthebody help the person to relax and stay connected and grounded. You can also say, for example: \"Saygoodbye to the person or place. Be aware of your body. Feel energized andmore relaxed with each breath.\"Visualization, Safe Spaceand Centering In using visualization with children, it is important to respect the uniquenessand style o f each child and to adapt the visuali-zation practice to the culture or individual. TheSafe and Sacred Space can be used to empower achild to claim their innerrefuge in moments o f tension or crisis, and toexperience inner safetyand security, while at thesame time viewing thereality of the moment withthe wisdom of the soul. Suggestions for TeachersCORE PRACTICE: Exercises and Points for Head and Neck Often children are unable to concentrate and learn because of emotional or physical pain that is blocked in the head and upper body in the form ofheadaches, stiff neck, tight jaw and overall stress and weariness. The fol-lowing exercises are helpful to open up the flow of energy in the head andneck and to release congested energy in the upper back. Head Rolls Gently and slowly roll your head and neck in circles (with your eyes opento avoi d dizzin ess). Do five or six head rolls clockwise, and then roll your head counterclockwise. Breathe deeply while doing the exercise. Shrugs Shrug your should ers up towar ds your ears while inhaling deeply. Hold for a momentand then drop your shoulders while exhaling in a long full breath. Do this several times to release stress and blocked energy fromyour shoulders and upper back. Let your jaw hang loosely, and yawn torelease stress in the jaw and face muscles. Head T ap Thereare manyacupressur e points in the head and scalp that can awaken energy in all parts of the body. Gently tap the top of the head and all parts of the scalp with the fingertips for several minutes. Imagine the tapsas raindrops washing away tension, sadness and fatigue. Jaw Tap Often a tight jaw can be a sign of tension and repressed feelings.Overwh elmin g stress can also trigger facial ticks and paralysis of the facial muscles. A gentle jaw tap for several minutes can help release stored stress and tension. With the finger-tips, lightly press into the joint where thejawbon es connect. Gently tap th ejoints for several minutes, imagining that witheach tap, the muscles become filled withlight and warmth, relaxing and releasingtheir tension. Brain Balance and F ocus Locate th eacupressur epoints at th e base of the skull in the indentation on either side ofthe head. These two points bal- ance the rational and intuitive sides ofthe brain. These points can be held,tapped or massaged. Gently hold the twopoints for several minutes while breathingdeeply. Imagine that your mind and spirit arefilled with light, clarity and peace. 18 Capacitar f or Kids Exercises for Head and Neck Brain Balance and FocusSection 1 Wellness Practices to Improve Learning and Mental Focus Capacitar for Kids 19CORE PRACTICE: Cross-lateral Exercises During the day we all have high and low energy cycles that are related to the activity of the left and right hemispheres of the brain. When the lefthemisphere is dominant, the child is better attuned to logic and sequentialthinking. This is followed by another period of greater activity of the righthemisphere, when random, creative and spatial abilities dominate. The lefthemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, and the righthemisphere controls the functions of the left side. The left and right sidesof the brain are connected by a bridge of nerve fibers called the corpus cal-losum that is responsible for communication between the hemispheres.Movement exercises, such as cross-laterals, create more cross-hemisphericactivity, helping children regulate their energy cycles as well as balanceboth sides of their brain. Cross-laterals are exercises whereby the left or right limb crosses over the visual field or midline of the body to the opposite side of the body. All of these cr oss-later als areenergizing and can help children when feeling \"off balance\" to think more clearly and improve coordination. The exercises arefun and can easily be done in a playful way. The Healthy Thump Tap the acupressure points just below the collarbone on either side ofthesternum. This pr actice increases en er gy flow, balance and overall well-being. The Cross Cr awl This e xercise is lik e marchin g in place.Begin by lifting the right arm an dthe left leg at the same time. As you lower the right arm andleft leg, lift th eleft arm an d the right leg. Continue the marching exercise for at least a minute. Exaggeratethe movement by swinging yourarms across the front of your bodyandlifting and crossing your leg toward the opposite side. Variations 1. As you march in place pat theopposite kn ee. 2.

Repeat on opposite side.Cross-lateral Exercises Cross-lateral exercises are an ex cellent practice to use regularly with childrentoharmonize the group and to balance and focusthe energy of the class-room. These exercises areespecially helpful for pri-mary grade children tohelp improve coordina-tion. Students can leadthe exercises in a playfulway as a game or withlively music as a dance.Suggestions for Teachers Cross-lateral Exercises The Cross Crawl Cross-lateral Exercises TheHealthy Thump Scissors This bilateral exercise is done in a seatedpositi on. Exten d the arms and legs out from the body and simply cross the arms and legsin front of you in a scissors motion. Continuethis for about a minute. As arms and legs arecrossing, you can also turn your head fromside to side. Tapping Acupressure Points Gently tap the acupressure points on eithersid e of the base of the skull for about a minute. Tap both sides at the same time. Resources for Further Study Jensen, E.

We are intercon- nected with this energy flow and often feel this force in our bodies andspirit. When this en ergy is blocked by stress, negativity, overwhelming feel- ings, lack of sleep or exercise, or an unhealthy diet, the body becomes sick.Pain, tension and sickness are messages from the body that the energy flowis blocked or stagnant. Children in particular are very sensitive to energy. With fing erholds, Tai Chi, Salute to the Sun and other practices used daily, childr en can recover th e natural balanced flow of energy, heal physical and emotional pain, and maintain strength and health of body, mind and spirit. Energy Flow of Body, Mind and Spirit Around us and within us is the energy of the universe that connects all living beings. We are interconnected with this energy, and in each moment we areable to feel this life force. Working to unblock, balance and increase the flowofenergy forms the basis of many healing systems in different traditions. Each person has the ability to experience and work with this energy tobring balance and harmony to body, mind and spirit. With wellness prac-tices, children discover their natural capacity, intuitive wisdom and inner power to brin gbalance andhealing to themselves and others. In the followin g exercises, children will discover and work with the energy in their bodies and hands. Guide the children to listen to their hands andbeaware of any sensations they may feel in their palms and fingers. Energy in our HandsStand and relax your legs, arms and shoulders. Imagine that your legs, feetand toes ar e like long roots connected with the earth and that your head andupper body are connected with the heavens. Place your hands togetherSection 2 Wellness Practices to Promote Energy Flow A family in Guatemala uses the fingerholds practice to manage emotions.and for a few moments rub them together briskly. Separate your hands, lis- ten to them for a moment and feel what is happening in your palms andfingers. What sensations do you feel? Try the exercise again. Rub your palms briskly together and then separate them. Experiment with the distance and the force of energy between and in your hands. Imagine that the energy is a globe or ball of light.Play with this ball of energy. Form a large ball and a small ball. Feel thesensation in your hands when you throw and catch the ball of light. Thissensation is an experience of your life energy. Bring your palms together again, bend your fingers and rub your fingernails together. After a few moments, stop and place your fingertips together. Feel the rays of energy flowing between your fingertips. Now lower your hands toward theearth, and feel your energy flowing with the earth. Raise your hands to the sun,and feel your energy flowing and connecting with the energy of the heavens.Gradually and with some practice, you will be able to nourish and balance your energy when you feel tired or in low spirits to bring a sense of har-mony and well-being to your body, mind and spirit. The Energy Field of the Body During theday we ar e constantly interacting energetically with our envi- ronmen tandwith those around us. Some people and situations drain our energy, while others fill and enliven us. When we become more consciousof our energy system, we can begin to recognize the people and situationsthat drain us as well as those that nourish us. With practice we can learnhow to protect ourselves energetically from being drained and how to havehealthy boundaries with others. Energy Field Ex er cise Stand straight and in a relaxed manner with feet shoulder-width apart and knees sli ghtly bent. Close your eyes, breathe deeply and imagine that your feet are like long roots running into the earth, grounding and connectingyou. Your back and spinal column are like a column of light supporting youbetween heaven an dearth. Connect with your heart center for a moment, breathe deeply and exhale any tension that you carry. Now image that from your heart center a strong radiant light begins to shine out. As the light grows, your energy radiates out in all directions aroundyou\u2014above ,below ,in front ofandbehind you\u2014f orming an egg or globe of light that shines with the tone and color that is you. Everyone who meetsyou immediately recognizes you by your unique vibration of energy. Enjoythe experience of your energy field. During the day, practice walking with anawareness of this light energy that surrounds and protects you. Imagine the circle of energy that also surrounds and protects others you meet. If a diffi-cult situ ation or person challenges you, imagine that you have clear boundaries of light and protection around you, so you can respond withrespect and wisdom in the moment. 24 Capacitar f or KidsEnergy Flow of Body,Mind and Spirit Children are very energy sensitive and o ften feel or see the flow o f energy ascolor or vibration around them.

The energy field visuali- zation is an importantexercise to help childrendevelop the capacity tocenter themselves and tohave clear boundaries forpersonal integrity andprotection. Words andimages appropriate to ageand culture can be usedto better develop the concepts o fenergy ,the energy field and protection.Suggestions for TeachersCORE PRACTICE: Fingerholds to Manage Emotions The following practice is a simple way to work with emotions and to develop emotional literacy. Emotions and feelings are like waves of energymoving through the body, mind and spirit. Often we judge emotions as\"good\" or \"bad\" rather than recognizing them as wise messages from thebody to guide us in our response to challenges in our environment. Withstrong or overwhelming feelings, energy can become blocked or repressed,resulting in pain or congestion in the body. Through each finger runs a channel or meridian of energy connected with an organ system and related emotions. By holding each finger whilebreathing deeply, we can promote the flow of emotional energy and feelings to bring physical release and healing. These fin gerholds ar e a helpful tool for children to use in daily life or in the classroom. In difficult or challengingsituations when tears, anger or anxiety arise, the fingers may be held to bringpeace, focus and calm so that the appro-priate respon se or action may be tak en. The practice may also be done as a medi-tation with music, or used before going to sleep to release th eproblems of the day and to bring deep relaxation to body, mindand spirit. Practice Hold each finger with the opposite handfor two to five min utes. You can work with either hand. Breathe in deeply; recognize and acknowledge the strong or disturbingfeelings or emotions you hold inside yourself. Br eatheout slowly an dlet go. Imagine the feelings draining out of yourfinger down into the earth. Breathe inpeace, harmony, strength and healing.Breathe out slowly, releasing past feelingsandproblems. Often as you hold each fin- ger, you can feel a pulsing sensation astheenergy and feelings move and become balanced . You can also hold the fingers of someon eelse wh ois angry or upset. The fingerholds are very helpful for young chil-dren when they ar ecryingor having a tantrum, or for people who are very fear-ful, anxious, sick or dying.Section 2 Wellness Practices to Promote Energy Flow Fingerholds to Manage Emotions Through each finger runs a channel or meridian of energy connected with an organ system and relatedemotions ,as shown in this diagram. When children experience an y ofthese emotions ,they may first hold the corresponding finger to bring peace, focusand calm to themselves so that they are better ableto act or respond appropriately to of Self-esteemThumb The thumb is for tears, grief and emotional pain. Babies or small childrenoften su ck or hold their thumbs for comfort. The fingerhold does not repress tears or sorrow, but allows the energy to move out and bereleased . Hold the thumb, breathe deeply and exhale grief, sorrow and sadness.Breathe in peace, comfort and strength. Index Finger The index finger is for fear. Fear can be a guide regarding our environ-ment, our ph ysical well-being or our growth as in dividuals . We often experience fear when facing changes or risks that offer an opportunityfor such growth. It is what we do with fear that can be either benefi- cial or harmful. If danger or risk is present, rather than being paralyzed by fear , hold th eindex finger so that a wise decision can be made in the situation\u2014to flee, to stay or to react. Use of the index finger is agood way to learn how to work with fear ,rather than to be a victim in the grip of fear. Hold the index finger, exhale and let go of fear. Inhale courage, strength and wisdom. Middle Finger The middle finger is for anger, rage and resentment. Anger is a naturalandnorm al emotion in many situations. But it is the response of anger that can result in violence toward others or self. Repressed anger or denial of feelings can result in passive-aggressive behavior or inphysical symptom ssuch as arthritis, ulcers, migraines or knots in the shoulder muscles. Hold th emiddle fin ger, exhale and let go of anger and rage. Inhale compassion and creative passion, transforming anger into wisdom. 26 Capacitar f or Kids Fingerholds Thumb\u2014Grief, T ears, Emotional PainFingerholds Index Finger\u2014 Fear, T error, PanicFingerholds Middle Finger\u2014 Ang er, Rage, Resentment Fingerholds The fingerholds are an important tool in emo-tional literacy to teachchildren to recognize theirfeelings and manage theexpression o f their emo- tions. Teachers can helpchildren develop emotionalunderstanding with thefollowing simple exercises. Have children draw an out - line oftheir hand, write in the name of the emotions for each finger ,and paint each finger with an appro - priate color . Tape copies o f the hand picture with theemotions to each child'sdesk as a reminder o fhow to work with different feel - ings as these feelings ariseduring the school day.Suggestions for TeachersSection 2 Wellness Practices to Promote Energy Flow Capacitar for Kids 27Ring Finger The ring finger is for anxiety, worry, preoccupation and feeling over-whelmed . Often people unconsciously play with their rings when they areworried about many things and bothered by constant mental chatter. Holding the ringfinger can help to discharge unnecessary worry and anxiety, saving energy for action. Breathe deeply holding the ring finger. Exhale, letting go of all worry and anxiety .Inhale a deep sense o fpeace, trust and security in the midst of life's problems. Small Finger The small finger is for lack of self-esteem, negative self-talk and victim-hood . Hold the small finger to transform feelings of unworthiness and low self-esteem into a sense of self-appreciation and self-worth. Hold the small finger and breathe deeply, exhaling and letting go of insecurity an dunworthin ess. Breathe in gratitude and appreciation for the gift of life. Resour ces for Further Study Goleman, D.

Images, along with the movements, help to release stress, to open and balance the flow of energy, and to promote health and well-being. The purpose of this Tai Chi meditation is not to master a traditionalform, but to empower the person in discovering and following their ownflow and body wisdom. The practice of Tai Chi reconnects the person withthe source of life, the universal energy of earth and heaven. With regularpractice the movements bring healing and harmony to body, mind and spirit. One or two of the Tai Chi movements can be used at the start of the school day, after recess, or before a test to help children release stress, calm theirspirits and focus their attention. Different images can be used that areappropriate for the grade and level of understanding of the students.

Most children are energysensitive, and often within less than aminute ,pain or congestion disappears when holdingacupressure points. Athird-grade teacher commented: \"One of the children who used to complain o fstomachaches now uses acupressure onher own and reports thatit completely relieves herupset stomach. She isalso pleased that she is able to handle thisproblem independently.She reports that she hastaught this to her parentsas for Teachers 44 Capacitar f or KidsCORE PRACTICE: Acupressure for Physical Symptoms Acupressure is an ancient art using finger pressure on specific points on the body to unblock, balance or increase the circulation of energy. The roots ofacupressure date back more than four thousand years to traditional Chinesemedicine. Hands-on folk remedies were passed down from generation to gen-eration to cure illness and relieve pain. In many indigenous cultures, grass-roots people have traditions of rubbing or pressing areas of the body torelieve pain or emotional discomfort. The acupressure points in this section may be used by the children on them- selves during the school day, or with the help of another person at home.The points described here are ones that help relieve symptoms of stress:nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, sleep disorders, chronic pain, headaches,back pain, depression, fatigue, memory loss, dizziness, general body pain,etc. The points can be used whenever symptoms occur, or even better, as adaily preventive practice for maintaining balanced energy flow in the body. The flow of energy through meridians nourishes and balances the entirebody.When this flow is r estricted or block ed,physical or emotional sick- ness or pain results. Tension in the muscles usually indicates a blockage ofenergy that has accumulated around an acupressure point. The point is located by feelin g for tension that appears as a tight area or knot in the muscle surrounding the point. When the acupressure point is held, the ten-sion releases, permitting energy to flow more freely through the area,allowing the body to heal and balance itself naturally. Self-acupressure The following acupressure points may be held while seated or lying in a com-fortable positi on. If you are able to, close your eyes and press the acupressure points with medium pr essure for two to three minutes. Often acupressure points are painful or sensitive. This is normal and is considered to be \"goodpain\" that wants to be released. You know you are finished holding a pointwhen there is a change in the quality of the pulsation. The energy pulse feelsclear,strong and balanced. You can enhance the energy flow with visualization and deep breathing while doing self-acupressure. When you hold the point,imagin ethat golden energy or light is circulating through the points and throughout your entire body, bringing harmony and balance to your wholebeing. Breathe deeply and imagine the flow of light energy. As you exhale,breath eout all th etension andpain associated with the point you are holding. Children need only about a minute of holding the points to clear and bal-ance their energy. Their bodies have fewer blockages than adults. Withtheir fingertips slightly curved, have the children press firmly into thepoint (using the bone inside the finger) and then lighten the pressureuntil they begin to feel a pulsation or energy flow. Don't worry if they can't feel th eenergy pulse. After a while their fingers will get accustomed to finding the pulse. The energy is flowing whether or not they feel it.

In the photos, Liz Waters of Ireland uses theholds on her son Patrick to help him relax as he prepares for final exams.Thepracti ce can be used for anxi ety,emotion al or ph ysical pain, traumatic memories, strong feelings and emotions such as anger or fear, insomnia, or deep relaxation. The Holds have been used very effectively with manydifferent cultures and in places of violence with highly traumatized people as a way to heal deep em otional pain. Through the energy of our hands, we have the power to bring profound peace,harmony and healing to body, mind and spirit. In using the practice on one-self or on another, children can imagine a deep sense of peace, light and spaciousness in their mind and hearts. The Holds can be done for several min-utes each, with eyes closed ,breathing deeply to promote greater release. The touch is very light. If someone has suffered abuse and fears touch, the Holdsmay be done a couple of inches off the body, working in the energy field. 1. Head Hold One hand lightly holds the head high on the forehead; the other handholds th e base of the skull. The energy of the hands connects with parts of the brain related to memories and emotions. 2. Cro wn Hold With th ethumbs o f both han ds together, hold the crown center at the top of head. Spread the fingertips and softly touch the area across the forehead. 50 Capacitar f or Kids The Holds The Holds can be taught in the schools as a self-care technique .

After you have covered the body, then go back and work on the part of the body thatmost needs relaxation. Depending on the amount of time available, you candothis for a couple o fminutes or for a longer period. Everyone feels so alive and vibrant with this massage. This is a good exercise for depression and lethargy. Drum massage can also be done on another person, and has remarkable healing effects on manyhealth pr oblem s. One researcher has synchronized the drumming to 90 beats per minute to g enerate deep trance states for healing people with physical or em otional problem s. Circle MassageDrum m assagecan easily be don e in a cir cle with everyone working on the shoulders of the person in front of them. You can also do regular shoulderand head massage this way, working on the shoulder muscles and back, thendoing a head rub, and thenfinishin g off with brisk back circles (clockwise forenergy, counterclockwise torelax) down th espine. Amassage circle can be fun and playful, especially if thegroup is tired and needs tobeenergized. Within this playful context, most peo-ple do not have th efear of physical touch as theymightwith a on e-on-on e massage. This is also a gooddynamic with youths whomight be embarrassed totouch one another. Drum massage can easily be done in a circle with everyone working on the shoulders of the person in front of them. In a group context, as shown herewith a group of people from Nicaragua, it is often fun and energizing.CORE PRACTICE: Pain Drain The Pain Drain can be done during the school day on oneself or at home on another person to relieve physical and emotional pain or tension in thebody. If the exercise is done on another person, it is important that thechildren learn how to protect themselves with a shield of light or energy(or some other appropriate image of protection), so that the tension ofthe other person is not picked up. If they feel the pain or tension of theother person entering their body, guide the children to use an image of agarden hose to drain the tension down into the earth. This practice can bedone for several minutes. 1. Drain the Pain from the Body Place the left hand on or above the area that hurts and hold the right handdown ward and away from the body. Imagine that you can drain the pain or tension from the painful area with your left hand, and this energy can circu- late through you an d move out your right hand into the earth. A pumping action with the right hand will speed up the process. Hold this position forseveral minutes or until any sensation or movement of energy flow stops. 2. Fill the Body with Light and Energy Reverse th ehands ,placin g th e right hand on or above the area that was painful an d hold up th eleft han d,palm upward, to bring in healing energy from the universal energy field. Imagine that the light of the heavens fillsyour left hand and circulates through you and out your right hand into thearea that was painful. Fill the area with healing, light and warmth. Remember that any energy drained off is neutral, does not have negativeor positive qualities and quickly dissipates into the universal energy field. Source Hover-Kramer, D.

Do this exercise for several minutes. Mindful Eating Often with the stress of modern life, we eat meals rapidly without even real-izing what we are eating. Many families do not even sit down at a table forameal together, but watch television or go off to their separate rooms. This kind of eating pattern can eventually lead to upset stomach, ulcers, andother digestive and eating disorders in children and adults. The practice of eating one item of food, such as a slice of orange or apple or apiece ofbread, is a good way to introduce the practice of mindful eating to children. This e xercise can be done as a ritual or ceremony for Thanksgiving or in preparation for some other holiday. The following guided meditation can be adapted to the appropriate language and grade level of the class. When the children have finished and have had a few moments in mindful meditation, slowly bring the group back together. Mindful Eating Depending upon what is appropriate , students can share their e xperience in the whole group or in pairsusing active listening. Orsome may prefer to makeajournal entry or create a drawing of the experience.Suggestions for Teachers Mindful Eating Meditation (Prepare slices o ffruit or bread in a ceremonial basket and place in front o fthe class .) As we celebrate together, let us give thanks for the food we eat and for the people who labored to grow and harvest this food . And let us also be mindful of the children and families living in places of war and poverty, whohave little or n o food today. This meditation can help to reconnect us with the sacredness of food. Breathe deeply and relax, with your feet touching the ground. For a moment, look at the food before you. Close youreyes an dconnect with this gift of food given to us by Mother Earth. Imagine the seed that sprouted to form this food and see the seed growing into a plant. As the plant grows, imagine a farmer tending the plant with great care.The sun shines on its leaves, and the rain and nutrients of the soil nourish its roots. When the farmer picks the harvest, he feels deep gratitude in his heart. And here now in this food before us, we have a symbol of the harvest.Breathe deeply for a few moments and when you are ready, open your eyes so that we can share the harvest. (When the group is ready, distribute a piece of the food to each person, and continue with the guided meditation.)As you receive your piece of food, hold it between your hands for a few moments and look at its shape and texture. Smell its fragrance and imagine the life force that this food will give to nourish your life. When you are ready, givethanks and bite into the food with love and respect. Taste the quality and texture of the food. Carefully chew thefood, marveling at your capacity to eat and absorb this food for your life. As you swallow, observe the food moving down into your stomach. Imagine the complex changes that are necessary to break down the food to give you the necessary nutrients to sustain your life. As you finish eating the food, taketime to sit mindfully present in the moment. Give thanks for the life that you share and exchange with the plantsand animals and with all being.\"As emotional intelligence develops in children, they are able to better understand their own feelings and, in empathy, can appreciate the differ ences in ho wother sfeel about things. Theyareable to listen and talk effectiv ely,and value openness and trust in relationships.\" 58 Capacitar f or KidsCapacitar for Kids 59The emotions can be likened to waves of energy moving through the body, mind and spirit, giving us the information and stimuli we need to act upon or respond to changes, stress or challenges in a situation or environment. When energy is flowin gfreely through the channels and energy centers of the body, the result is good health an demotional balance. When feelings are overwhelm- ing, denied or repressed, the emotional energy gets blocked in the body, caus- ing congestion, pain or illness, and often resulting in erratic behavior. Children learn pattern s ofemotional expression from family, school and society. When children are anxious, angry or depressed because of upbringing or traumatic experience, they have difficulty learning and may be unable to listen, focus orconcentrate .Their em otional brain is in conflict with their cognitive brain. The exercises in this section, as well as in the entire manual, help to unblock, release an dbalance theflow of energy to promote emotional well- being. Through the fingerhold meditation, Emotional Freedom Technique and acupressure practices described in this section, children can work with their emotional states in daily life. They can learn to recognize emotions asresources in making wise choices for their actions, rather than falling victim to their feelin gs. Emotional Intelligence Intelligence for many teachers has traditionally been a measure of themind\u2014a stud ent's cognitive ability .Schools have focused on teaching chil- dren reading, problem solving, analysis and decision-making, and on devel- oping the many cognitive skills needed for life. What has been missing in most courses o fstudy, however ,is a consideration of emotional intelligence, aconcept developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman, Ph.D. Current research shows that in humans, there are really two parts to thebrain: the cognitive brain responsible for conscious and rational Section 4 Wellness Practices to Promote Emotional Balanceoutward activity and the emotional brain responsible for survival and unconscious regulation of functions within the body. For health andwell-being, both \"brains\" depend on constant integration and interac-tion. Inner harmony results when both cognitive and emotional brainswork together, cooperating over the functions of thinking, emotionsand behavior. Recent studies show that students who become most successful in life have high intellectual capacity along with a good range of emotional skills. Indeveloping emotional intelligence in the classroom, children should be ableto do the following: identify and name feelings express feelings assess the intensity of feelings manage feelings delay gratification control impulses reduce stress know th edifference between feelings and actions As emotional intelligence develops in children, they are able to betterunderstand their own feelings and, in empathy, can appreciate the dif- ferences in how others feel about things.

The exercises in this Capacitar manual help children to develop \"body literacy,\" opening them to the wisdom that is inherent in their being. The practices support the development of emotional intelligence, enabling children to connect with their inner wisdom, listen to their body and feelings, and guide their decisions and actions. Fingerhold Meditation for Emotions The fingerhold exercise is an important practice to help children developemotional intelligence. Through this practice they are able to identify emotional states, as well as work to release the energy of the emotion. As explained in Section 2, \"Fingerholds to Manage Emotions,\" page 25, the fingerholds may be done as a meditation or visualization with music, or used bef ore going to sleep to release the problems of the day and to bring deep relaxation to body, mind and spirit. To review: The thumb is for grief, tears and emotional pain. Th e index finger is for fear, terror and panic. Th e middle finger is for anger, rage and resentment.

Before using the finger-hold meditation, work with the children to buildthe concept of the Safeand Sacred Space (seeSection 1) by using pic- tures of nature and help- ing children to imagine and create a place wherethey can find inner peace and safety. To reinforcethis concept, children candraw or paint an image of their safe space, filling itwith nature and imagesthat are supportive andnourishing.

Children can be taught the practice of tapping their wor- ries and problems away, without having to discuss their trauma and stress. The technique (shown photographically on page 65 and as a diagram in Figure 4.1 ,on pag e 66) is based on energy field theory, along with meridian theory of Eastern medicine. Problems, traumas, anxiety and pain can cause a block in the healthy flow of energy. Tapping or pressing points on channels ormeridians can help move blocks in congested areas and promote the healthy flow of energy in the body, mind and spirit.

In many cultures of the world, spiritu al practices such as pr ayer, meditation and ritual are part of everyday life. The spiritual journey into maturity is considered to be the central pur- pose of life. Awakening to our sacred nature is the goal. In many modern materialistic societies, families and children have lost iden- tity with their roots, traditions and spirituality. The result often is despair, hopelessness and loss of a sense of the Sacred. Yet the hunger and longingof the human heart remain. Children, in particular, have sensitive spiritsthat need to be spiritually nurtured. Reconnecting to the Source of Life and to thebeauty an dabundan ceof nature through daily rituals and prayer are simple ways to encourage the spiritual growth and development of children. Many of the Capacitar practices, such as Tai Chi, fingerholds and Salute to theSun (see Section 2), can be adapted with scripture or sacred images and used as bod y prayers.Children easily recognize the Sacred within themselves and readily embrace the awakening and healing that comes from a dailyspiritual practice. The following section develops the concept of mindful- ness, along with meditation and ritual for classroom and daily personal use. Mindfulness\u2014Body, Mind and Spirit Wisdom Dr. Roger Walsh, M.D., in Essential Spirituality writes: \"Our world is in des- per ate need of healing. But it also rests in good hands, because it rests in yours. And in you rests the Source of all healing, and all that is needed to awaken you and the world.\" Connectin gwith the inherent wisdom of body, mind and spirit is essential for the unfolding of the human person. As children grow and develop, they can easily be thrown off cen ter,acculturated with unhealthy patterns, andSection 5 Wellness Practices to Nurture the Spiritlose their deeper connection with Self and the Sacred. Learning how to return to the center and connect with this deeper wisdom of the Self is an important capacity to awaken in children. When we are connected with this wisdom or higher consciousness in the present moment, we know what is appropriate to do and we can flow with any situation for the higher good. Different spiritual traditions call this\"mindfulness.\" The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Martin Luther King, Jr., for his nonviolentservice during the Vietnam War, teaches mindfulness as a way to live in all of our daily activities. Mindfulness is an open awareness that can be brought to each moment and activity of life. This practice involves the discipline of staying grounded inthe present moment, in the here and now, so that the mind does not run to the past or to the future. The mind rests in the stillness of the moment,as if it wer ean eternal moment. Jon Kabat-Zinn, Ph.D., describes mindfulness as \"waking up and living in harmony with oneself and with the world. It has to do with cultivating some appreciation for the fullness of each moment we are alive. Most ofall, it has to d owith being in touch. Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose ,in thepresent moment and nonjudgmen- tally.Mindfuln ess pr ovides a simple but powerful route for getting our- selves unstuck, back in touch with our own wisdom and vitality. It is a wayto take charge of our own lives, including our relationships within the fam-ily,our relationship to work and to the larger world, and our relationship with ourself as a person.\" Mindfulness is a powerful tool to cultivate with children as they form good habits of concentration, focus and self-management in the classroom. Many of the Capacitar practices, such as breathwork and visualization (Section 1) and the fingerholds (Sections 2 and 4), help prepare the child for livingwith mindfulness by clearing the mental chatter and healing overwhelming feelin gs. In this section, meditation, prayer and ritual are developed as ways to mindfully nurture the spirit. Sources Walsh, Roger.

Some of the meditation methods currently taught in many places are the fruit of diverse cultures andspiritual traditions. Some forms of meditation are used as part of religious ceremonies and rituals, while other forms, studied by doctors and psychologists,are used to alleviate physical and emotional pain and to promote healing. With meditation, a person's attention is directed to the clear and sacred center of one's inner being. Some methods of meditation use the body orthe mind to come to a peaceful state. Those methods, based on control ofthe mind, use contemplation, visualization and concentration to arrive at ameditative state. Some contemplative practices use a sacred word, mantraor prayer. Visualization focuses on a scene or imagery. And concentrationinvolves focus on an object, such as the flame of a candle or the words of aprayer. With the control and quieting of mind or body, the person is able to achieve deep peacefulness. Other practices work with the intention of \"let- ting go\" of either the body or the mind, including the relaxation of muscles and body movement, so that the person remains open and still in the pres-ent moment, in the here and now. Meditation has long been known to contribute to a person's physical, psych- ological an demotional well-being. An alpha state of brainwave patterns usually results from different meditation practices, and this level of consciousness promotes deep healing. Breathwork, visualization, safe space, Tai Chi and the Salute to the Sun\u2014practices that have been covered in different parts of thismanual\u2014are kinds of meditative practices that contribute to the physical and spiritual health of children. This section will present several practices of mindful- ness and meditation to help children to focus and center themselves. The follow- ing meditations can be adapted to the grade level and language of the children. Seated MeditationSit quietly an dcomfortably with your back str aigh t and your feet touching the ground. Begin by following your breath moving in and out of your nostrils, and eventually follow your breath all the way down into your abdomen. Become aware of the rising and the falling of your abdomen. Stay with your breath and observe how your body moves with the process. Now observe anything else that may come to your awareness\u2014sounds, images, sensations in the body, odors or temperature. Try to observe each experience fully, without judgment or interpretation. Observe everything that comes to you in a clear str aightforward way, without interpreting what is happening or thinking \"this is good\" or \"that is bad.\" Notice that thesensation schang econstantly, like a flow where nothing is solid or per- manent. Pain may come and then release. A joyful or pleasurable feeling may pass through the body and then disappear. Observe everything deeply,seeing each experience arise and then break apart and change, so thateventually you are able to look into the nature of the experience itself. Section 5 Wellness Practices to Nurture the SpiritAs you continue to do this, your mind will become very still and calm. You will be able to look at all that arises with a great clarity of observation,seeing things as they truly are. You can bring this pure nonjudgmental quality to all that you do during the day so that you are mindfully presentto each moment. Continue the practice of mindful seated meditation, firststarting with five to ten minutes several times a day and working up tolonger periods of time. The practice may also be done while holding acu-pressure points. Mindful Walking Meditation Walking meditation is an ancient practice popularized by Buddhist monk Thi ch Nhat Hanh. Many indigenous people have the practice of walking slowly and respectfully, mindful and present to the miracle of nature. Oftenwe live life in a rush, without paying attention to the remarkable thingsthat are around us in each moment. We see without truly seeing, live with-out savorin g theprecious moments of life. Walking meditation is a good practi ce for children o fall ages to use when it is difficult to sit still. The act of walking slowly in nature is very grounding and calming to the body,mind and spirit. It is also an excellent practice to use with children who have never experienced meditative practice. It is especially beneficial if done outside walking in nature. When doing this practice with a group of children, it is advisable to go over the route before starting the walking meditation. Be aware of anyareas that are difficult to navigate, especially if participants have some level o fdisability .Also be awar e ofother people or animals in the area and whatever you might run into during the walk. Plan a route to pass plants, trees and flowers. If walking indoors, try to pass items that may be somehow connected with nature or the Sacred. You can place a bou- quet o fflowers or plants along the route, so that people can connect with thegrace of nature. Give an orientation to the children before starting on the walk. After the walk, give the children time to process the experience alone or together. Orientation to Walking Meditation The following orientation can be used with children, adapting the languageto their ag e and grade level. Iinvite you to join me in a walking meditation. We will be walkin g much slower than we usually do and in silence, coor- dinating our breathing with each step. For example, you can take three steps with each in-breath, and three more steps with each out-breath. M akeyour br eathin gandyour steps as natural as possible, following whatever rhythm feels good to you. If your rhythm is a little faster than the person in front of you, you can respectfully pass them to maintain your natu- ral pace. As you walk along, be aware of the contact between your feet and Mother Earth. Take each step with great love 74 Capacitar f or KidsMindfulness, Meditation and Prayer Ask children for sugges- tions about when they could practice mindful-ness during the schoolday or at home . Some examples might include: Traveling on long, uncomfortable bus trips Waiting in line at the store Taking a shower or bath in the morning or evening Doing some repetitive task at home or school Cleaning the house or helping a friend With continued practice, mindfulness can become avaluable habit and a way of life, groundingthe children in the hereand now, and relievingtheir minds of worriesand anxieties, and ofpast or future concerns. Suggestions for TeachersSection 5 Wellness Practices to Nurture the Spirit Capacitar for Kids 75and reverence. Imagine that with each step, your feet are able to touch the Earth with great respect. We have brought muchdestruction to the Earth, so walking with great love and rever-ence is a way to reconnect with our Mother, the source of ourbodies and our lives. As we walk with this consciousness, wecan be aware of the energy in our feet as they touch the Earth.Imagine that your feet are like roots in the Earth, and through your feet you are continually absorbing energy from the Earth. As you breathe deeply and walk along, be mindfully aware and open to all that you pass. Imagine that the outside realityflows into you. And without judgment, you are present to all,observing and appreciating each being around you. With ten-der eyes, look at the plants, flowers and trees you pass, as ifyou wer eseeing them for the first time. Breathe in the per- fume of the flowers and listen to the sound of the birds. From time to time you might want to reach out and touch theleaves of a tree or the petals of a flower, feeling their textureand their unique energy. Look down at th esoil an dsee th einsects an dsmall animals that might be there. See the water and the dewdrops pene- trating the earth, nourishing and giving life to all being. Smell thedamp pungent earth, fragrant with energy, minerals and the elements needed for life. Observe any animals you might pass along the way, including human animals. Without judgment, just observe them going about their daily lives, digging in the earth, flying throughtheclouds, walking along or working. Observe that they, too, have the same needs as you do. And like you, they are nour-ished and held by Mother Earth. Breathe deeply and fill your lungs with fresh air, feeling the connecti on with th eair molecules moving in and out of your body. Look up at the clouds and see the same air in the sky that is moving in and out of your body. As you breathe deeply, imagine that you are able to exhale all of the tension that you feel in your body, mind and spirit. Inhale all the nourish-ment you need for your life and well-being. Wewill walk in silence for about 15 to 20 minutes before returning back to the classroom. You may wish to sit quietly after you finish walking. Or if you wan tto draw or write about your experience, there are pens and pieces of paper on the table for you. Afterwards we will take a few minutestogeth er to shar eanythough ts or e xperiences from the walking meditation. Walking meditation is especially beneficial if done outside walking in nature.76 Capacitar f or KidsMindful Eating Meditation: Preparation for Eating Meditation Often in the stress of modern life, we eat our meals rapidly without evenr ealizing what we are eating. Many families do not sit down at a table for ameal together, but watch the television or eat on the run on their way to other activities. This kind of eating pattern can lead eventually to upsetstomach, ulcers and many other digestive disorders. The following practice comes from Christian monastic and Buddhist tradi- tions, where meals were eaten mindfully in silence. The practice of eating oneitem o f food,such as a piece of orange or apple, is a good way to introdu ce children to th emeditation of mindful eating. In working with a group of children, it is important to prepare the fruitahead o ftime, so that all is ready in advance. You might also want to taste the fruit beforehand to be sure it is good for the meditation. Eating Meditation Setting: Children are seated at their desks or in a circle. In the center is arran ged a colorful piece of fabric along with flowers, plants and other images of nature to form a sacred space. A platter of orange or apple slices to be used d uring the meditation is placed in the center. Soft background music may be used during the eating meditation. The words of the medita-tion can be adapted to th efood being used and the age of the children. Guided Eating Meditation: Breathe deeply and relax, with your back straight and your feettou ching the ground. Look at the oranges that will soon nour- ish your body, mind and spirit during this meditation. Closeyour eyes and for a few moments, connect with this gift givento us by Mother Earth. Imagine the seed that sprouted many years ag oto form the orange tree that bore this fruit. See the seed gr owinginto a plant. As the plant grows larger, imagine the farmer who tended the growing tree with great care. Imagine the tree growing into fullness with the sun shining on its leaves, and the rain and nutrients of the soil nourishing its roots.Finally th etree is suffi ciently large to begin bearing flowers. Smell the fragrance of the orange blossoms in the The practice of eating one item of food is a good way to introduce children to themeditation of mindful eating.Section 5 Wellness Practices to Nurture the Spirit Capacitar for Kids 77tree's first springtime. See the bees buzzing around the blos- soms, picking up the nectar and moving the pollen to other blossoms to fertilize the first fruits. See the oranges growing into fullness, ready to be harvested. As the farmer picks theoranges and carefully places them in a basket, feel the gratitudein his heart for the abundance of his harvest. The oranges go tomarket where they are sold with respect. And now here in ourmidst we have the fruit of much care. Breathe deeply for a fewmoments and when you are ready, open your eyes so that wecan share the fruit and partake of the harvest. Give participants a few moments to return from the visualization. When thegroup is ready, have someone prepared to ceremoniously walk around the circlewith the platter and respectfully present the fruit to each person. As each person takes a slice of orange, you can continue with the guided meditation. As you receive your piece of fruit, hold it between your hands for a few m oments andbehold the miracle of its life. The life ofthis or angewill g oto nourish your life .Notice the shape and texture of this orange, with each part made up of millionsof small cells vibrating with life. When you are ready, give thanks for the food and bite into the orange with love and respect. Taste with your tongue the quality and texture of its fleshy fruit, the sweet and sour of its juice.Carefully chew the slice between your teeth, marveling at your capacity to eat and absorb food for your life. As you swallow, observe th e food m oving d own into your stomach. Imagine the comple xchemical changes that are necessary to break down the tissues o fthe fruit to give you the necessary nutrients to sus- tain your life. As you finish eating the fruit, take time to sit mindfully present in the moment. Give thanks with joy and love for thelife that you shar eand exchange with all being. When all participants have finished and have had a few moments in mindfulmeditation, slowly bring the group back together. Depending upon what is appropriate, participants can share their experience in the whole group orin pairs using active listening. Or some may prefer to write about it in a journal or draw a picture of the experience. Mindful Living Childr en can learn to live in th espirit o fmin dfulness throughout the day, whether at school, at home or at play. Mindfulness is a daily habit. To move into the spirit of mindfulness, all that is necessary is to become consciousofthebreath an dto be pr esentin the moment. Thich Nhat Hanh uses the wonderful statement, \"Breathing in I calm my body, breathing out I smile. Present moment, wonderful moment!\" Living with this sense of the miracleof the moment can heal many stress-related problems.During the day, there are many times when children often increase the tension and stress of life by the way they deal with situations and people. Or they can learn to respond to stressful moments from a place of mindfulness. When faced with a challenge or with difficult people, breathe deeply, smile, and try to be mindfully present in the moment, respecting ratherthan resenting the tension of the situation. As our quality of presence andour attitudes change, so do the people and the circumstances around us. Thich Nhat Hanh suggests two situations that can be fruitful occasions for mindfulness: riding in a car and answering the phone. When caught in bumper-to-bumper traffic, the red brake lights of the cars in front of you can be a reminder to return to consciousness of the breath and to the presentmoment. When the phone rings, stop for a moment and breathe deeply. Then mindfully be present to the person on the line before saying, \"Hello!\" Rituals and Celebrations From earliest tim es,the family an dthecommunity gathered together to ritualize significant moments of life, death and passage. With the advanceofmodern culture, traditional rituals and gatherings in communities were lost for a variety o freasons\u2014the migration of refugees, the breakup of local communities by war and violence, and the advance of modern ways.In many cultures ritual has been a resource for people to deal with grief,loss and emotional pain, as well as to celebrate special moments. Ritualsand gatherings in the circle have provided ways to reclaim the healing power o fcomm unity an dto make meaning out of difficult moments that people have e xperien ced in dividually or as a group. Rituals are a valuable way to give children an experience of their roots and traditions, as well as to make meaning out of challenging life experiences, such as the death of a classmate or a tragedy in the community. This sec-tion deals with the elements of ritual, the creation of ritual, and someplans for rituals and celebrations in the community. These ideas are offered to inspirechildren to look to their own cultural resources and to talk with their grandparents and elders about what was traditionally done in theirown comm unities. The Nature of RitualEach emonies andrituals to celebrate speci al m oments during the year and significant occasions in life. Most often we think of \"ritual\" as a prescribed order of religious ceremony, like worship or liturgy that follows rubrics and ancient traditions. Rituals elevate all involved to th erealm of sacred mysteries. Besides formal religious ceremonies, there are also many other kinds of rit- uals that touch th eordinary moments of life. One definition of the word \"ritual\" is \"a pattern of activity that is repeated over and over again,\" 78 Capacitar f or KidsRituals and Celebrations The following are some e xamples of rituals that can be planned by children for their class orcommunity. Healing ritual for a sick friend or family member Ritual for peace and healing for our world after a disaster Dedication of the school year Ritual of completion and celebration before graduationSuggestions for TeachersSection 5 Wellness Practices to Nurture the Spirit Capacitar for Kids 79such as a ritual afternoon cup of tea, a ritual evening bath, or the way some families eat their main meal together. With mindful attention to themany human and ordinary moments of life, ritual can imbue these momentswith extraordinary meaning. Mindfulness transforms many routines into rit-uals. Christina Feldman and Jack Kornfield in Stories of the Spirit, Stories of the Heart write: \"Our growth as conscious, awake human beings is marked n ot so much by grand gestures and visible renunciations as by extending loving attention to the minutest particulars of our lives. Every relationship, every thought, every gesture is blessed with meaning through the whole-hearted attention we bring to it.\" With these different aspects of ritual in mind, it is important to begin to help children look at how ritual is a part of life\u2014and if it is missing, to take some time to talk to grandparents and other members of the familyand community to discover the traditions and rituals of their heritage. Claiming traditions, rituals and celebrations can be a wonderful way toreconnect with the community and to bring healing to many wounds ofthe heart. Personal Rituals The following are some simple suggestions of daily rituals that can bringthesacred dimen sion into one's life. Candle Lighting Rituals: To connect with the Light within\u2014at a difficult m oment or time of distress or depression, at a time of joy, for a dinner celebration, or to honor the memory of a loved one. Cleansing Rituals: Tocleanse negative en ergy or diffi cult memories\u2014a ritual prayer; a ritual shower or bath; a cleansing diet; or use of water, salt, music or incense to clear negative energy. Forgiveness Rituals: To forgive and let go of the past\u2014a prayer, or a ritual gesturewith an other person. Thanksgiving Rituals: To acknowledge the blessings of life\u2014a prayer, a can dle, flowers, or a gesture. Rituals of Remembrance: To reconnect with people who have died, past events , or special moments. Creation of a Sacred Space: To create an altar or some simple place in the homewhereim ages, flowers, photos of loved ones, elements of nature or written prayers may be reverently placed. The Elements o fRitual Rituals, both personal and communal, may include many different parts. Th e following is a simple formula of elements to help children create their own rituals. Rituals and Celebrations Continued Also invite the children to mak e their own sugges- tions for rituals. A circleof chairs around a sacredspace is an effective way to create a ritual environ-ment. The sacred spacemay be created very sim-ply with a brightly coloredpiece o fcloth placed in the center on the floor or on a low table .Flowers, images and candles maybe placed on the cloth tosymbolize the theme of the ritual. A good way toinvolve children is to invite them to bring some things that are sacred to them or are connectedwith the theme of the ritual. It might be an interesting assignment to have chil- dren talk to older family members about ways theyused to celebrate specialoccasions in their familyand see if they can trace the cultural significance ofthe ritual.Suggestions for TeachersThe invocation: This is the calling upon the sacred to be present. This can tak e the form of a song, a formal prayer or a gesture, such as lighting a candle or burning incense. The action of the ritual: This deals with the reason why the community is gath ered together, or why the ritual is being done. This part may include any or all of the following: readings from sacred texts, poems, or writings of group members music and songs dance and symbolic gestures aprayer of petition, asking for the benefit of the community asharing of food acommitment of the community Aprayer o f thanksgiving and blessing: The prayer may be through gestures or wor ds. The community gives thanks for the gifts of life and for what has been r eceived ,and receives a blessin gto carry on the journey. Aconcluding action or gesture: This part of the ritual is to close the sacred space an d mark the moment of return to daily life. Items of use during the ritual: These may include water, fire, candles, in cense, flowers, food, sound (such as bells), salt and oil. Celebr ation and Body Mo vement Movement, dance and music are powerful ways to release traumatic stress and balance energy. Research has shown that dance and movement can be significant therapies for the healing and empowerment of those who sufferfrom trauma and violence. When the Capacitar International Team coordi- nated the Healing Tent for the NGO World Forum on Women in China, the Chinese doctors taught the team dances that the people of China use torelease the stress of the day. One lively dance used movements that criss- crossed the limbs to release blocked energy and balance the meridian flows.The doctors also said that the Chinese use music for healing in their clinics. In The Mozart Effect ,Don Campbell d escribes how music has the power to stimulate our innate h ealingsystem sby connecting us with the deeper rhythms of life. Resear ch has shown that m usiccan str ength en memory and learning, boost productivity, regulate stress-related hormones, boost the immune function, affect body temperature, increase endorphin levels, reduce muscle tension, improve body movement and coordination, and affect respiration, heart- beat, pulse rate and blood pressure. Music has a positive effect on people who have suffered some kind of physical or emotional trauma, and is cur-rently used in som e hospitals to alleviate pain or anxiety connected with surgery or medical procedures. This section offers some simple suggestions on ways to use movement, dance and music for healing. 80 Capacitar f or KidsSection 5 Wellness Practices to Nurture the Spirit Capacitar for Kids 81Free-form Movement and Dancing One of the best ways to release blocked energy and open channels or m eridians is free-form dancing. Free-form movement can be a very benefi- cial experience for children, but only after some level of trust and comfort has been established. Usually after some work with Pal Dan Gum and TaiChi, participants are ready to move more freely with their bodies, without feeling too self-conscious. If you sense that the group is inhibited, you cantalk about the feeling of discomfort and invite them to experiment withholding the feeling while moving freely anyway. Often just acknowledgingthe feeling is a simple, direct way to move the energy. The choice of music for the free-form movement is also important. Look for music that is appro-priate for the group and their culture. Sometimes lively music is the best; other times soft graceful music is good for gently releasing pain. With free- form movement, the body leads the dance through the expression of feel-ings, thoughts and body sensations. Some ways to warm up the group include dancing while sitting down, stretching as part of the dance form, or visualizing the dance before doing it. As you dance you can add sounds and breathing to release blockages. If anymemories spontaneously come up, imagine that the images can flow through th ebodyand out into the ground. Another way to guide the free- form dancing is to invite participants to walk freely around the room while you name different emotions. They will try to feel the emotion and then express it through their bodies\u2014joy, sorrow, anger, frustration, hope, alive-ness, peace, playfulness, etc. As you change from one feeling to the next,have participants breathe deeply to release and let the emotion flow out of them. With children this can be lots o ffun an dcan help them to learn how to recognize feelings an dto release th em. The Dance of the Trees Free-f orm movement can use nature to help participants connect with heal- ing images. Movement performed outdoors under the trees or surrounded by mountain s andclouds is a wonderful way to release stress, to breathe in pure fresh air and to absorb the healing rays of the sun. If it is not pos- sible to be outdoors, you can lead children in a guided visualization where they go into a garden and connect with the trees, flowers, running water, etc. When they have internalized these images, you can then invite them to move with free-form dance, using the following as a guide. This can be donein silence to the sounds of nature, or you can have some flowing musicto accompan ythe dance. Breath e deeply an dimagin ethat you are a special tree planted in the garden. What kind of tree are you? Pine, eucalyptus, redwood, oak, willow, cypress, palm, magnolia, apple, etc. (Name trees appropriate to the cultureand region.) What does it feel like to be this tree? Become that tree.Move for a few moments like the tree that you have chosen to be. Nowimagine the tree going through the cycles of nature. First you are a youngsaplin ggrowing strong, with roots running deep into the rich soil ofCelebration and Body Movement With the imagery of the tree , children usually enjoy the movements.After the dance you caninvite them to share in pairs or as a whole groupwhat the experience waslike, or prompt them withquestions such as the following: What kind of tree were you? What were the cycles of nature like? What feelings came up? Where did you feel tightness or tension in your body?Suggestions for TeachersMother Earth, and branches reaching up to the heavens. As your tree matures, you begin to bear flowers and then fruits or cones. Feel yourfruitfulness and the abundance of your harvest and seeds. And then you pass into the autumn of your cycle, with the fruits, seeds, and leavesfalling into the ground, to become part of the soil. The cold of wintercomes and your branches are dormant. You move into a period of greatstillness and hibernation, holding life deep within you. And then come the first rays of springtime, warming your branches and roots. The first leaves and buds begin to sprout until you are an amazing burst of beauti- ful blossoms, alive with new life and possibility. Throughout the cycle ofyour life, feel your rootedness to the earth. When storms and winds whirlaround you, you have the flexibility and balance to move with it all, because you are deeply rooted and grounded on Mother Earth. Take a fewmoments now to flow with the grace and beauty of your tree. And when you are ready, gradually bring your dance to a close. Feel the beauty andgrace of your body, and the strength and peace of your being. Music, Song and ChantTraditionally song and chant have been used to connect the person and comm unity with the sacred, to give meaning to life's rituals, and to bring joy and energy to all. Chant and song involve breath and sounds that have beenpassed on through many generations. In Chanting: Discovering Spirit in Sound , Robert Gass speaks o fthepower o fchantto an chor and entrain as well as to connect us with the healing energy of the morphic field of the music: \"Theancient chants have been infused with power and meaning from the voicesand devotion of millions of people over the centuries, creating a kind of energy field that impacts us here today as we intone the sacred syllables.\" Music, song, and chant are good ways to enliven a group of children and to get the energy flowing. If they are shy about singing, there are many recordings of traditional songs that you can use to sing along. Many children are also musicians, or potential musicians, so a good way to usemusic and rhythm for healing is to bring in some simple instruments like tambourin es, maracas, rain sticks, drums, bells (or even pots and pans) andother traditional local instruments. The rhythms, vibrations and pulsing beat of the human voice, drum and other instruments are found to be ofgreat healingbenefit.

In many places whole communities or societies suffer from intergenerational trauma and violence. Children in particular are most affected by stress, violence and dysfunctional patterns in the family, classroom, playground and community, and often are unable to learn. The work of schools and teachers, besides proficiency insubject areas, is to give children skills to enable them to heal stress, tochang eunhealthy patterns of thinking and acting, and to develop their true potenti al. All o fthepractices in this Capacitar manual can help children release traumatic stress, improve learning and develop their capacities of body, mind and spirit. Transforming Stress into Well-being: Stress and Compassion Fatigue Teaching, studying and caring for family, friends and other people can be both rewarding and challenging. Without good self-care we can suffer from stress, burnout, compassion fatigue and feelings of being overwhelmed.Even small children can suffer stress when living in difficult situations or when dealing with a school bully. The symptoms of stress and compassion fatigue are just like those found in people who have suffered violent or traumatic experiences: headache, body pain, anxiety, nervousness, insomnia,stomach disord ers, fatigue, numbness, strong emotions, depression, etc. It is important for children and adults to recognize these symptoms and take responsibility for caring for themselves. The following questions can be used for a checkup from tim eto tim eon th estate o f health and well-being. Daily use in the classroom of some of the energy practices can promote well-being for children in the midst of all the struggles of life.Section 6 Wellness Practices to Heal Traumatic StressQuestions for Self-care 1.

Children feel pain,stress and emotions deeply ,even though they might not be able to put these feelings into words.They are often confusedwith these feelings anddon't know what to do for themselves .Capacitar practices can be helpful tools to build into dailylife to help children better handle the challenges as well as the traumas oflife.Teachers can help children to explore differ- ent ways to care for themselves when they feel sad, angry or hurt.Suggestions for TeachersCapacitar for Kids 89Protection and Boundaries Learning how to protect oneself and how to set boundaries is an important skill for all people, and especially for children. During the day we are constantly interacting energetically with our environment and with thosearound us. Some people and situations drain our energy, while others fill and enliven us. Most of this interaction happens on a subconscious level. When children become more conscious of their own energy system, they can then begin to recognize the people and situations that drain or nourishthem. With practice they can learn how to protect themselves energeticallyfrom being drained and how to have healthy boundaries with others. Severalimages and practices from different cultures can help develop this capacity. Wr apping Oneself in Light The Mayan peoples of Guatemala have a traditional practice of protection that has been used f or generations. The people \"wrap\" themselves and their children in healing light before starting the day. Spiritually we are all inter- connected with the sacred energy that flows through us and through all ofnature. With this practice of protection, we make ourselves conscious of thesacred energy that is always with us and around us. Start in th earea of the head and with the hands, brush through the energy field,wrappin gsacred light around the body, like a protection of grace. Radiating Light as Protection Stand straight in a relaxed manner with your feet shoulder-width apart andyour kn ees slightly bent. Breathe deeply and imagine that from your navel grows a long cord that goes down into the earth to ground and connect you.Your back and spinal column are straight like a column of light supporting you between the heavens and the earth. You might want to close your eyes.Place your hands beneath your navel and connect with your center for a moment, breathing deeply and exhaling any tension that you may be carrying.Now as you br eathein andout, imagine that an egg or circle of light begins to shine out from your center. As the light grows, your energy radiates outin all directions around you\u2014above, below, in front of, and behind you\u2014 forming an egg or globe of light that pulses and vibrates with the rhythm that is you. Enjoy the experience of your energy field. During the day, practice walking with an awareness of the light energy that surrounds you. Imagine the circle of energy that also surrounds the people you meet. Images for Protection In differ entkinds ofsitu ations or with people who drain energy, it is important to know how to protect yourself. Usually the person who is negative or who d rainsanoth er's energy is not at all aware of what they are doing. If you are exhausted at the end of a day, or from having to interact with different people who drain you, begin to listen to your body and discover where you feel tension or sensations indicating that your energy isbeing pulled. Section 6 Wellness Practices to Heal Traumatic StressUse the following visualizations to \"protect\" yourself, depending upon the situation: Imagine a window of glass that surrounds you as protection and sets your boundaries.Imagine that a globe or an egg of rose-colored light (the color of com- passionate love) surrounds you and protects you. Nothing can penetrate this shield, but you are able to give off love and compassion to others. In difficult situations, imagine a strong yet graceful shield of impenetra- ble material surrounding you to establish your boundaries. Feel strong, secureand protected. Shielding with Your HandsIf you feel that a person or situation is pulling energy from a specific part ofyour bod y(f or example, from your solar plexus, your heart, or your throat), place your hands gently over this area of your body. Imagine that your hands form a shield of protection. If the memory of a situation or an event comes to mind, breathe out all thecaptur ed painful energy, and breathe in loving kindness and compas- sion towar dyourself an dtheexperience. Recognize that you are now living in the present moment, and that what has happened is over. As you breathe out and let go of the memory, look at the wisdom you have gained to live more fully in the present and to not repeat the situation. If you feel chains or cords connecting you with people, past events or memories, you can visualize cutting the cords that bind you. Use the abdominal breathing exercise to center yourself. When you feel sufficiently ready and finished with a situation or memory, choose some way to cut theties that bind you\u2014an imaginative scissors, sword, fire or cleansing whitelight. After the visualization, feel the wholeness and integrity of yourself. Holding Your Energy FieldSometimes when we are with people in situations of conflict, we start out like afull juicy plum an dleave lik e ad ried-up prune, completely drained by others. The following practice offers an effective way to hold your energy so that others do not drain you in conflictive situations. Be seated and cross your ankles. Relax your hands on your lap and join together the fingertips and thumbs of both hands. Breathe deeply, relax your shoulders and feel your energy system circulating through the channels that run through each of your fingers. Rather than losing energy, with this postureyou are circulating your energy in a closed system. You can be fully attentive to others an d focused on the matter at hand, without being drained. 90 Capacitar f or KidsProtection and Boundaries Having the capacity to center oneself, f ocus, recognize one's bound- aries and respect the boundaries o fothers is an important skill for children as they matureand learn how to relate to themselves and others.Boundaries and protection are key concepts to developwith all children, and inparticular with those whoare victims of domesticviolence or sexual abuse. Children who are victimsof trauma usually have no boundaries and have verylow self-esteem. Working with the energy field can help to strengthen self- esteem and develop a sense o fpersonal worth and recognition o fthe integrity of self.Suggestions for TeachersSection 6 Wellness Practices to Heal Traumatic Stress CORE PRACTICE: Figure 8 Exercise to Heal Energy Drain This practice, an adaptation of the work of psychologist Phyllis Krystal, uses the infinity sign or \"figure 8\" to energetically separate oneself fromanother person, a traumatic memory, negative self-talk, or a strong emotionthat can drain energy and cause depression or anxiety. This practice encour-ages in children the creation of healthy personal boundaries and the recog- nition of their integrity, core energy and self-esteem. Practice Imagine yourself in the center of a circle, surrounded by a tube or cylinder o f golden light. Next to your circle, imagine another circle in which you place th eperson, strong emotion, negative self-talk or traumatic memory from which you want to energetically disconnect yourself. With respect, surround the other person, emotion, or memory with a circle of golden light. (As you start the practice, you are still energetically connected at the point of intersection of the two circles.) Now visualize a blue neon light that moves around, following the direction of afigure8\u2014first ar oundthecircle where you have placed the person, strong emotion or traumatic memory, and then around the circle where you are. Continue to visualize this blue light moving around and around like afigure 8or infinity symbol (see Figure6.1). Figure6.1 Visualizing the Figur 8Exercise MeOther P erson Memory Trauma Event Negative ThoughtFeeling Mental MessageFigure 8 Exercise This exercise can help children to create healthyboundaries or to separatefrom nightmares , fears, memories or traumas. With young children, sug-gest they place their fears into balloons to create the feeling o fseparation and distance .When they are ready, they can cut thecords o fthe balloons and release the difficult feel - ings into the heavens.Suggestions for Teachers Capacitar for Kids 9192 Capacitar f or KidsHead-Neck-Shoulder Release This is an excellent e xercise that can be taught to children to relieve back, shoulder and head pain resulting from sports, study, work on thecomputer or stress. Helpthe children to locate thepoints. Often they willreadily feel with their fingertips the energy pulses in the points .The fingers should be slightlycurved using medium pres-sure for holding points .Suggestions for TeachersDo this practice for several minutes at a time, repeating it two or three times a day for several weeks or a month or two. A good time to do this iswhen your subconscious is most active: when you first awaken, just after meditation and before you go to sleep at night. Slowly, the recognition ofyour core energy, your separateness from the person or feeling you place inthe other circle, enters your subconscious mind. After several weeks or months, and only when you feel ready to do so, cut the tie that binds you. You can do so literally or figuratively, creating your own ritual of separation. Taking a knife, scissors, candle or other imple- ment, sever the energetic tie with great respect for the energy field of the other and with great respect for your own core energy. Fully release theperson, memory, negative thought or trauma, giving it back to itself. Standalone in the fullness of your energy being. This practice is especially helpful with relationships or situations that drain energy, and should usually be done without the other's knowledge. Doingthis pr actice doesn't imply that you ar ephysically leaving the person or situati on. Rath er,you have d etached energetically from the bond that is draining or that is not healthy. Variation: If you have difficulty imaginin g the process, you can draw the figure 8 on a piece of paper to help you visualize it, or you can trace the figure 8 in the palm of your hand with your finger, thus embedding it in your tissues. CORE PR ACTICE: Head-Neck-Shoulder Release This acupressure practice releases pain, tension and congestion in the upper back, shoulders, neck and head. It is based on the work of Aminah Raheem, Ph.D. When people experience trauma and stress, often their energy becomes blocked in the shoulders, neck and head. Most of the energy channels flow through this area, resulting in a \"bottleneck\" of tension in some people. Children can do this practice in the classroom on themselves, or at home on another person. If the children will be doing this on another person, guidethem in h owto keep clear boundaries. If they feel the other person's energy coming into their hands, have them imagine it flowing through and down into the earth. With slightly curved fingertips, press into the six sets of points shown in Figure 6.2 for one to two minutes, or until the energy pulse is clear, strong an d flowing. Most of the points will feel sensitive. (The acupressure sequence is illustrated photographically in Figure6.3on pag e94.) Durin g the practice, imagin ethe energy flowing freely and in harmony, while breathing deeply. To end,imagin ethat your feet are rooted to the earth to ground you. If working on another person, you can hold the tops of their feet to ground them.Section 6 Wellness Practices to Heal Traumatic Stress Capacitar for Kids 93 Sets of Points 1.

We wanted to bring health and well-being to the lives of children, their families, teachers, schools and communities.Too often children are the unseen and unheard victims of the choices of the adults in their lives. Our vision was that simple wellness practices could serve as valuable tools to help children healand transform the stress and violence of their lives so that they could better learn and grow ashealthy and whole persons. The Good Samaritan Hospital Foundation and TriHealth Parish Nurse Ministry collaborated on this three-year pilot health program with Capacitar Founder/Co-Director Patricia Mathes Cane, Ph.D.,and Capacitar International. Capacitar practices and methods were introduced at in-service trainingdays for the faculty and staff of Holy Family School and St. Joseph School, Cincinnati, Ohio, in2003-2005. During the school year, Parish Nurse and Program Director Mary Duennes, R.N., metregularly with administration, faculty, staff and students to review the wellness practices, to intro-duce additional material, to monitor health issues and to encourage the learning process. Capacitar pr actices wer eintegrated throughout the existing course of study with age-appropriate learning and cross-curriculum continuity. Ongoing support for faculty, staff, students and parentswas offered to help them learn the practices as well as understand their value for daily use in school, on the playground and at home. During the second year of the pilot program, a Capacitar for Kids teacher's manual was published. Avideo was pr oduced with children modeling the practices for use as a teaching tool. The overall program was m onitor ed with ong oingcomputerized evaluation and measurement of outcomes with student and faculty questionnaires and by group feedback. Positive changes were noted in student behavi ors, emotional self-management, attitudes and conduct in the classroom and on the play- ground ,andreduction in stress-related symptoms as reported by students. To date the Capacitar for Kids program has had an overall positive impact on the children and faculty at both schools.Because of the positive outcomes to date, trainings for teachers and staffs will be offered to other schools in the area during the third year of the pilot. Through this pilot program, it is our hope that Capacitar for Kids can bring hope and healing not only to the local community, but also to the larger world. Capacitar for Kids models reverence for all life an dencourages the experience of our deep interconnection. At a time of global trauma and violen ce, the program offers to students and teachers tools and possibilities for personal and com- munal healing along with a recognition of global solidarity. Through Capacitar for Kids we envision an ever-growing circle of children, their families, schools, teachers and communities, all joined hand in hand, healing ourselves and bringing healing to our world. Wewish to express our deepest gratitude to Catholic Health Initiatives for their financial and moral support to make this endeavor possible.Appendix III: About Capacitar International Fact Sheet History, Vision and Mission Capacitar is a national and international network of empowerment and solidarity based in Calif ornia. Founded in 1988, Capacitar is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to heal ourselves and heal our world. Capacitar teaches simple wellness practices to individuals, families and communities, working especially with those affected by violence, poverty and trauma, placing in the hands of people skills to empower them to heal and transform their lives and their societies. Capacitar currently works in 26 countries on five continents. These include 16 states in the United States, Mexico, Ireland, Northern Ireland, and countries in Central and South America, theCaribbean, A sia/Pacifi c(Indonesia, East Timor and Sri Lanka), and Southern and Eastern Africa. By invitation Capacitar responds to needs identified by communities and works through established groups and in concert with other economic and social development efforts. Capacitar started its first workshops in 1988 in response to the needs of grassroots Central Americans affected by violence, poverty, war and trauma. Since its founding Capacitar trainers have offered more than 1,500 primary workshops to more than 40,000 people on five continents.Participants in turn have shared the trainings with their families and communities, multiplyingthework to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Capacitar gives workshops that model alternative uses of power as well as sensitivity to culture and traditions. Capacitar connects people from grassroots organizations through an internationalnetwork of solidarity, building relationships of cultural and personal understanding. \"Capacitar\" is a Spanish word meaning to empower, to encourage, to bring each other to life. Programs, Method, Staff and Teams Capacitar uses a learner-centered popular education approach in its programs, empowering participantsto connect with their own d eep wisdom and capacities of body, mind and spirit. Because of the enormity of trauma in many places, Capacitar uses an educational approach, rather than an individualor group therapeutic approach, so that many more people can benefit. Capacitar m ethods involve healing, team building, and personal/community development using simple body-mind-spirit practices such as Tai Chi, visualization, breathwork, meditation and acupressur e. Practices used by Capacitar come from many ancient cultures as well as from current research. Practices and methods have been researched and field-tested with a large cross-section of people from different cultures, ages and socioeconomic groups and have shown positive outcomes. 112 Capacitar for Ki dsCapacitar for Kids 113Capacitar programs include the following: Multicultural Wellness Education\u2014a one-year training in theory and practices with a community internship Trauma Healing and Transformation\u2014an intensive training in trauma theory and holistic approaches to healing Healing Ourselves, Healing Our World\u2014basic Capacitar workshops for grassroots groups Trainings in Team and Organizational Development\u2014with Capacitar practices Livingin Wellness Programs\u2014for caregivers, families and persons with HIV/AIDS or cancer Capacitar for Children\u2014trainings for schools, teachers, children and families Capacitar's website (www.capacitar.org) contains a description of programs and partners in differ- ent world areas, a calendar of workshops and trainings, and a listing of manuals and materials available in different languages. Capacitar has trainers and/or teams in different countries and states, respecting an organic growth and program development consistent with the needs, culture, spirituality and reality of the people andarea. Som eplaces have formal well-developed teams and centers (e.g., in El Salvador and Chile), other areas have developed coor dinating teams and regular workshops for groups (e.g., in South Africa, Botswana, and Tanzania), while still other groups have incorporated Capacitar practices in the context of an established center with its own unique spirit (e.g., in Argentina, Peru, Guatemala, Wisconsin, and San Diego/Tijuana). Capacitar has a small staff in Santa Cruz, California, whose function is to coordinate national andinternational trainings, communications, newsletters, funding of programs, networking, and development and distribution of workshop materials.

A small staff in California directs the nonprofit organization, Capacitar International. Capacitar International has a training team that responds to invitations for trainings and represents the organization in the field. In many countries Capacitar local teams and groups of multipliers have developed their own organizations that sponsor ongoing gatherings, workshops and outreach. What does \"solidarity\" mean to Capacitar? Since its founding in 1988, Capacitar has accompanied grassroots people in places of war, vi olence, poverty and disaster. We have walked in solidarity with those working for justice, peace andreconciliation in their communities. Because of our twofold commitment to heal ourselves and heal our world ,we have gained the trust of people living in places of trauma and violence. The credibility of Capacitar with so many grassroots people is directly connected to this commitment of personal and societal healing and transformation. How can Capacitar work effectively with so many different cultures?Capacitar work embodies a fundamental respect for and sensitivity to cultures and traditions.U sing popular education methods, Capacitar develops in its trainers and participants principles of multicultur al understan ding. In Capacitar workshops facilitators create an atmosphere of respect for cultural systems including language, boundaries, gender issues, learning styles, mores and customs. When Capacitar receives invitations from grassroots groups or organizations to come to their country or region, trainers work closely with hosting groups to learn about their culture and socioeconomic experience so that workshops and methods meet the needs and reality of the people. Howdo people in various cultur es react to learning the energy practices? Most grassroots people are sensitive to energy and are grateful to learn ways to connect with theen ergy in their own hands. The practices Capacitar teaches come from ancient cultures as well as curren t research. En ergy is the basis of most traditional healing systems. In modern times, many people have lost the fundamental connection with their own body wisdom and their capacity touse their energy for healing. In our trainings people are encouraged to reconnect with this sourceand to ask their community elders what they traditionally did in their culture to heal their bodiesand spirits. 114 Capacitar for Ki things? Capacitar practices (acupressure, Tai Chi, Pal Dan Gum, Chakra work, etc.) do not originate with th e \"new age movement\" but come from many ancient cultures. The practices have been well researched by Capacitar for their benefit to body, mind and spirit. Current medical research also shows the positive health benefits of many of these ancient practices. Some newer modalities (Emotional Freedom Technique, Thought Field Therapy and Polarity) have also been included inCapacitar programs because of their effectiveness. We have field-tested all practices with hundredsof people from different cultures and socioeconomic groups. We evaluate program content, methods and outcomes. Is Capacitar faith-based? Capacitar is non-denominational, respecting the faith, religious beliefs and commitments of all people .Capacitar r ecognizes the spiritual interconnection we all share with the Source of Being. Through its practices Capacitar endeavors to inspire people to recognize the sacredness of life and the goodness an dwisdom we carry within our body, mind and spirit, and to make a commitment to create justi ce, nonviolen ce and peace in our world. Many people use Capacitar as part of their daily spiritual practice and incorporate some of the practices in their group rituals and ceremonies. Can any one be a Capacitar trainer?Participants in Capacitar workshops are encouraged to informally share what they learn with their f amilies, friends and communities in the spirit of popular education. Capacitar International has a team o ftrainers wh o officially represent the organization and its policies and curriculum. These trainers respond to invitations received by Capacitar International and are responsible for ongoing research, evaluation and development of programs. What is the meaning of \"popular education\"? \"Popular education\" is a dynamic educational method developed by Brazilian Paulo Freire that empowers people to awak en to their own wisdom and power. It is used extensively with grassroots people in Latin America and Africa. Popular education forms the basis of Capacitar's learner-centered approach. Using wellness practices such as Tai Chi and acupressure, Capacitar teaches \"body literacy\" to reconnect people to their own wisdom and capacity. An important aspect of popular education is themultiplier effect\u2014people are encouraged to pass on what they have learned to their families and communities, empowering the learner, contributing to the community and multiplying the work. Does Capacitar do ther apy? Capacitar uses a popular education approach, rather than a therapeutic approach. Workshop lead- ers ar e educators, not therapists or counselors. Capacitar places skills in the hands of the people so they can do for themselves. In many places where Capacitar works, individual therapy is notculturally appropriate, while education is valued and accepted. The Capacitar educational approachis an importan tway to meet the needs of many traumatized people in places of massive trauma and violence where there are often not enough individual therapists.
