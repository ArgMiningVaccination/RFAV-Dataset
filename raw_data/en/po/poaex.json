NUNM is authorized by the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission Office of Private Postsecondary Education, Office of Degree Authorization. University and Program Accreditation NUNM is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). Accreditation of an institution of higher education by the NWCCU indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality evaluated through a peer review process. An accredited university is one tha t has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the NWCCU is not partial, but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. An inquiry regarding an institution's accredited status by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities should be directed to the administrat ive staff of the institution.
