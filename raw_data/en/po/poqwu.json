It involves the insertion of fine thin sterilized needles into specific strategic points called acupoints on the body. The theory behind acupuncture is based on the fact that there are energy channels or energy meridians in the human body. These energy channels or meridians carry energy or Qi throughout the entire body and connect all parts of the body, internally and externally to one another. When a person is healthy, the energy channels or meridians are opened and unblocked, and energy or Qi can flow smoothly through the channels, just like water flowing in a long smooth water pipe without any hindrances. However when the energy channels or meridians are blocked by various reasons and factors, energy or Qi cannot flow smoothly and is slowed down or even hindered in its coursing through the channels or meridians. This is equivalent to having the pipe twisted or clogged by years of dirt or a piece of garbage is lodged within the pipe, creating a narrowing or even blockage of the water flow along the pipe. This is the situation when a person is ill, when the energy is flowing not smoothly. These meridians or energy channels however do not follow the exact pathways of blood flow or nervous system. Acupuncture is a treatment that rebalances and unblocks Traditional Chinese Medicine explains that acupuncture is the treatment modality that involves skilled techniques to balance and unblock the flow of energy or Qi in the energy channels or meridians within the body. By inserting needles into the specific points or acupoints along the energy channels or meridians, and executing the right techniques in manipulating the needles, the energy or Qi flow can be rebalanced- slow energy or Qi flow can be quickened, fast energy or Qi flow can be reduced in rate of flow. If there are any blockages or stagnations, acupuncture can help to clear the blockages or stagnations and regain the smooth flow of energy or Qi. Acupuncture is a mind-body intervention Traditional Chinese Medicine is an ancient traditional medicine dating back more than 2000 years that gives importance to the human body constitutional make-up as not purely only at the physical level, but also at the functional and energetic level of mental and emotional. Traditional Chinese Medicine recognizes the mind is important in the treatment of illnesses and the energetics beyond the physical symptoms is integral to this healing approach and all the treatment modalities that it encompasses. Hippocrates also noted the spiritual and moral aspects of healing and held the belief that recovery from any illnesses could happen only with the factors of attitude, environmental influences, natural remedies were well taken into consideration. Therefore, Acupuncture is not just simply an act of puncturing needles through the skin into the body, but more correctly - a mind-body intervention. Through physical techniques, the energetics of the body can be assessed and rectified. And when the energetics are balanced, the physical stability ensues which gives rise to good health- physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. Acupuncture is a treatment that relaxes, heals, repairs, renews physical body tissues Although the actual definition of Acupuncture is highly influenced by the concept of Qi/energy and Blood of the Traditional Chinese Medicine system, Acupuncture works effectively in the Western Medicine and Science through actual physical benefits that is already proven by scientific diagnostic methods. In Acupuncture, needling is the first step of the traditional therapy. The [physical reactions from needling ](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/how-tcm-works-scientifically) are seen as the first step to any kind of healing or recovery of the physical body tissues and also the mental aspects and mind. Currently there are already existing research done on the needling reactions which can be from three major aspects. They are namely neuronal, biophysical and biochemical. When acupuncture is done, the action of needling stimulates messengers of the above three major physiological pathways to be released and set off the cascading reaction pathways. These messengers can be neurotransmitters, hormones, inflammatory factors, cytokines and others. The physiological pathways that are set off by the messengers are said to initiate healing to occur through the neuronal and humoral pathways. And because of that the physical body tissues ranging from muscles, nerves to vascular and glandular can repair, renew, regrow naturally. History of Acupuncture The theory and practice of acupuncture has its origin in China. Around 6000 BCE, [Acupuncture](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/interesting-tcm-facts-acupuncture-needles-were-made-of-stones-and-bones) [ needles were made of sharpened stones and ](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/interesting-tcm-facts-acupuncture-needles-were-made-of-stones-and-bones) [bones](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/interesting-tcm-facts-acupuncture-needles-were-made-of-stones-and-bones) . It was also said that these needles might have been used for simple procedures such as cutting an abscess. In 168 BCE, the Ma Wang Dui medical manuscripts were entombed at the Ma Wang Dui burial site in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. The site comprises of three separate tombs which have been sealed at different times. The tombs contain the bodies of Marquis Dai, his wife Lady Dai and their son. Many artifacts found in the tombs were related to treatises on medicine, war, personal cultivation, materia medica and recipe for foods. Medical documents also showed that there were references to the system of energy channels or meridians but had no references to acupuncture procedures in them. Acupuncture procedures were found in The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine (Huang Di Nei Jing) as the earliest documentations at around 100 BCE. This is the go-to book for all Traditional Chinese Medicine theories and philosophies and treatment methods in which all practitioners and students of Traditional Chinese Medicine are required to study. The book is presented in the format of question and answer between the Yellow Emperor and his learned minister named Qi Bo. The acupuncture procedures and detailed knowledge regarding the concepts of energy channels and meridians were recorded in the book. Yet precise locations of acupuncture points were developed slightly later. Development of Acupuncture Acupuncture was developed over the next few centuries and eventually became one of the key treatment modalities in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Other treatment modalities such as herbal medicine, massage or tuina therapy, heat therapy, moxibustion and others were used to support acupuncture treatments. In fifteenth century, Bronze statue or we called them which has acupuncture points on them were developed and used for examination and teaching purposes. During the Ming Dynasty between 14th and 16th centuries, The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion was published. The book includes the principles of acupuncture, the records of the three hundred and sixty five acupuncture points location and properties for treatment. Decline of Acupuncture From 17th century, there came the decline of Acupuncture as it was considered illogical and laced with superstitions. In 1822, the Emperor excluded this tradition from the Imperial Medical Institute. However some scholars and rural healers held on to the knowledge of this practice. In the 20th century, there were more interests in Western Medicine and acupuncture was further discouraged and disrepute. In 1929, this practice was even outlawed in China together with some other forms of traditional medicine. Revival of Acupuncture In 1949, the Communist Government of China revived the traditional forms of medicine including acupuncture. From then on, research institutes of Acupuncture were established and the practice was made available in several hospitals. Acupuncture started then to spread to other overseas countries such as Korea and Japan in the 6th century, hence the development of Acupuncture and Traditional Medicine in Korea as well as Japan. Ten Rhijne, an European doctor who worked for East India Company described the practice medically in 1680. And by 19th century, interest in this ancient practice was developed further in America and Britain. Flourishment of Acupuncture in the West It was in 1971 when President Nixon travelled to China and his accompanying journalist had had a surgery for removal of his appendix as a result of acute appendicitis. His post operative pain was treated with Acupuncture with great effectiveness and he became so impressed with the Acupuncture practice that he wrote about it in The New York Times. From then it created interest in the [success of the procedure ](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/interesting-tcm-facts-how-traditional-chinese-medicine-got-to-the-west ) [throughout the United States and subsequently all the other countries in the West](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/interesting-tcm-facts-how-traditional-chinese-medicine-got-to-the-west ). During a National Institute of Health consensus conference, acupuncture was finally accepted as a professional treatment in the healthcare system in the United States due to the positive evidence for its effectiveness in many health conditions. Positive efficacy of acupuncture In the report from the consensus conference, it was noted that most of the patients have a positive response to acupuncture. Scientific evidence showed that acupuncture is especially effective in alleviating pain from post operations, chemotherapy induced nausea, pregnancy nausea, menstrual cramps, fibromyalgia, tennis elbow. Acupuncture effective role in various health conditions The World Health Organization have already cited more than 40 conditions that acupuncture is effective in treating. Some of the health conditions that are cited in the report from World Health Organization are postoperative pain, low back pain, myofascial pain. The report also states that the adverse effects of acupuncture is substantially lower than that associated with the use of many other chemical drugs and Western medicine interventions. What Is Acupuncture Used For In China, the country of origin Acupuncture has been practiced in China, the country that it originated from, for more than 5000 years and it is used on a daily basis by millions even until today. In classic Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture has been applied to treat every and any kind of illnesses and health conditions. From acute illnesses to chronic diseases, from daily small minor health issues to pandemic outbreaks, Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine had been the solutions to treat and heal for the people. This was especially so before the introduction of Western Medicine which was invented by Hippocrates who lived 2400 years ago. This signified that Western Medicine had developed later as compared to Traditional Chinese Medicine and that Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture had been serving and saving people at least two centuries way before Western Medicine. Given that Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture was the only therapy available, it could and had to have the effectiveness to treat all kinds of illnesses. In Western countries and countries other than China Given the wide and long running use of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture, it does not seem logical and more unbelievable to the Western Medicine physicians that such a simple procedure can have such a wide degree of clinical application. Despite such skepticism, the fact remains that Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture have achieved impressive results in curing conditions that have no solutions or deemed untreatable in Western Medicine. Nonetheless, over the years, ongoing researches have been done on Acupuncture, including studies on the mechanisms of Acupuncture and its effects and other clinical trials and studies. This is because in conventional medical practices, substantial research evidence is required to support the use of the practices in clinical settings. But for Acupuncture, it is a complex intervention that may vary in many aspects of the treatment for different patients with similar conditions. For example, the frequency, number, length of Acupuncture treatments, the acupoints used vary greatly with every patient and in every session. This made executing controlled trials for measuring the effectiveness of Acupuncture difficult, resulting in the paucity of high-quality research trials to substantiate the efficacy of Acupuncture. Nevertheless, a Consensus Development Conference held in 1997 by National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative Medicine and the National Institutes of Health Office of Medical Applications of Research shed light to the world with a responsible assessment of the use and effectiveness of Acupuncture for a variety of health conditions and addressed other important issues regarding Acupuncture. The conference brought together national and international experts in fields of acupuncture, physical medicine, internal medicine, pain, psychology, psychiatry, drug abuse, family practice, health policy statistics, physiology, biophysics and representatives of public. After 1 and a half day of presentations and discussions, the consensus made encouraging conclusions on Acupuncture and its various issues. One of which was the list of health conditions that could be treated with Acupuncture as recognized with World Health Organization (WHO). Upper Respiratory System Acute sinusitis Acute rhinitis Common Cold and Flu Acute tonsillitis Respiratory System Acute bronchitis Bronchial asthma (Most effective in children and uncomplicated conditions.) Eye Disorders Acute conjunctivitis Central Retinitis Myopia (in children) Cataracts (without complications) Mouth Disorders Toothache Post Extraction Pain Gingivitis Acute and Chronic Pharyngitis Gastrointestinal Disorders Spasms of esophagus Hiccough Gastroptosis Acute and Chronic Gastritis Gastric Hyperacidity Chronic Duodenal Ulcer (pain relief) Acute Duodenal Ulcer (without complications) Acute and Chronic Colitis Acute Bacillary Dysentery Constipation Diarrhea Paralytic and Trigeminal Facial Palsy (early stage, i.e., within 3-6 months) Pareses Following a Stroke Peripheral Neuropathies Sequelae of Poliomyelitis (early stage, i.e., within 6 Dysfunction Shoulder Sciatica Low Back Pain Osteoarthritis Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Back and Knee Pain Fibromyalgia Chronic Fatigue Sports Injuries and Pains Reproductive & Gynecological Conditions Premenstrual Syndrome Dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps) Spotting and Excessive Bleeding Amenorrhea (Loss of Menstrual Period) Impotence Infertility Incontinence Prostatis Mental Emotional Problems Stress Anxiety Depression Insomnia How Acupuncture Works Biological Effects Of Acupuncture From Western Medicine And Science Pain control through endogenous analgesia activation Our brain has developed complex system of modulating pain sensations through the opioid and non opioid analgesic system and the anti opioid system. Acupuncture is said to activate the endogenous analgesic system in the body to release opioid peptides that can help lessen the pain experienced to a degree that is clinically significant. Anti-inflammatory effect through vagus nerve The autonomic nervous system is widely and usually considered to be the mediator in acupuncture stimulation by interconnecting external somatosensory inputs with internal organ responses through the central neural networks. Vagus nerve is the main component in parasympathetic nervous system and oversees a wide range of important body functions such as mood control, immune response, digestion, heart rate. The therapeutic anti inflammatory effects of acupuncture in the internal organs may be mediated through vagus nerve modulation of inflammatory responses in the internal organs. Signals from many different acupoints may be transmitted into the vagus nerve and affect the function of the autonomic nervous system in whether inflammatory responses are activated. Stress management and Immunity Regulation Through Activation of Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a complex set of influences and feedback interactions among the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the adrenal gland. The axis is a major endocrine system that controls reactions to stress and bodily processes such as digestion, immunity, moods, emotions and sexuality. The axis is also involved in the neurobiology of mood disorders and functional illnesses such as anxiety, bipolar disorder, insomnia, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, alcoholism and many others. Stress During periods of stress, there is increased production of cortisol and glucocorticoids to facilitate the fight and flight response. However, prolonged exposure to high concentrations of glucocorticoids is damaging to brain tissues which can lead to various mood disorders. Acupuncture stimulates and reset the axis to a balance to regulate the production of cortisol and glucocorticoids, this is the reason why [acupuncture ](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-stress-management) [helps manage stress and emotions](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-stress-management). Immunity There is bi-directional communication and feedback between the HPA axis and the immune system. The central nervous system regulates the immune system through neuroendocrine pathways such as the HPA axis. The HPA axis is responsible for modulating inflammatory responses that occur throughout the whole body. When the HPA axis is activated by stressors, such as an immune response, high levels of glucocorticoids are released into the body which suppress the immune response. Acupuncture thus modulates the HPA axis which gives rise to immunity regulation rather than suppression. Blood flow changes Acupuncture induces transient reductions in blood flow due to sympathetic activation that are followed by subsequent increases in local blood flow in the skin and/or muscle. It is also found that acupuncture can affect blood flow of the peripheral, mesenteric and retrobulbar arteries. This in turn has effects on microcirculation and a wide range of illnesses and diseases related to poor blood flow such as myalgia, pain, vascular, metabolic and regulatory health conditions. Energetic Effects Of Acupuncture From Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupuncture is based on the principle of restoring equilibrium of the body's state of energy through Qi flow regulation in the corresponding meridians and acupoints. Therefore to understand the energetic effects of acupuncture, we have to first know about the concepts of Qi, meridians and acupoints. What is Qi? The concept of Qi is not exclusive to Traditional Chinese Medicine. In many major cultural traditions, Qi is seen as a form of energy that is important and vital to guide a person's physical, mental, emotional and even spiritual processes. In Indian tradition and culture, Qi is known as prana. In Greek, Qi is known by the name of pneuma. Qi is described as an innate and in-built intelligence of the human body to regulate its own internal environment to a state of balance. This is comparable to the homeostasis processes in our body seen from a scientific point of view. The concept of Qi forms the basis in all the theories and philosophies of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture. Blockages of Qi, deficiencies and weaknesses of Qi, excessive Qi are the simplified groundwork for formation of illnesses. Remedies such as Acupuncture, herbs and other modalities of Traditional Chinese Medicine are aimed at realigning this Qi in the body to a balance and healthy state. What is Meridian? Meridians are channels which Qi or vital energy travel in within the human body. They are not nervous systems as seen in science, although many pathways of the nervous systems overlap with the routes of the meridians. Meridians cannot be seen by the naked eye. Yet they can be felt especially when one is doing energetic works such as acupuncture, qi gong, breathing exercises, meditation, yoga. Because of the theories of meridian, it substantiates a lot more theories in Traditional Chinese Medicine as to how some internal organs are connected to external body parts and vice versa. And through meridians, acupuncture works in a magical way in which an illness localized at a particular body part can be treated from another part of the body. What is Acupoint? Acupoints are points located on the meridians. They can be seen as gateways along the energy channels where more vital energy or Qi aggregates. They are defined as particular parts of the body surface for infusing or diffusing Qi and blood of viscera and meridians, the body lesions reflex points as well as the important stimulus points for acupuncture. Therefore depending on the techniques of acupoint stimulations, vital energy or Qi can be redirected or transformed to rebalance and realign the flow of energy. [Every acupoint has their own characteristics and properties](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/interesting-tcm-facts-acupoint-names-have-their-own-significance-and-power) and the knowledge of them can help to determine which should be stimulated or pacified to regain balance to the entire energetic state of the human body for health and wellbeing. Formation of illnesses Having to know some of the definitions of terms used to describe the energetics of Acupuncture, we can then proceed to understanding how acupuncture works in Traditional Chinese Medicine philosophy. As mentioned above, in Traditional Chinese Medicine, everything is based on Qi. When a person is healthy, Qi flow throughout the whole body is smooth, unblocked and sufficient. A person with enough Qi in his or her body is typically seen as healthy, energetic and radiant. Also if there is a virus attack, people with balanced Qi can quickly fight off the virus or if the person get injured, he or she can recover very fast. With smooth, balanced, sufficient Qi flow, a person has great endurance, immunity, digestion, falls asleep fast and able to attain quality rest, light hearted in mood as well as functions with a clear mind and able to complete their daily tasks. When a person is unhealthy, their Qi may be insufficient, blocked or become excessive. When Qi is weakened, the person will always feel tired even after a night's rest, have problem digesting food, lack of appetite, susceptible to colds, flus and allergies, low in blood iron, easily depressed and become emotional. When Qi is blocked, the person may experience aches and pain, tension, mind fog. When Qi is excessive, the person can be irritable, stressed, easily angered, may even have control issues. In summary, illness is a presentation of imbalanced Qi. Further Reading: [Illnesses do not form in one day and recovery is not immediate](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/illnesses-do-not-form-in-one-day-recovery-is-not-immediate) How Acupuncture works to treat illnesses energetically Qi can be insufficient, blocked, excessive at different parts of the body, at different areas of the meridians or energy channels. Acupuncture uses needles as a form of stimulation at acupoints which are critical points along the meridian energy channels that have more vital energy or Qi. The acupuncture needle stimulations can create changes to Qi flow, nourishes Qi or even dissipates Qi through techniques in the needle manipulations. Also each acupoint has their own characteristics and properties, therefore when a set of acupoints are being stimulated within a session of acupuncture treatment, it is equivalent to that of a treatment formula being applied to treat the illness in particular. During the rest time when the needles are positioned in the acupoints, Qi flow changes accordingly to what acupoints are stimulated and how the acupoints are stimulated by the acupuncture needles. When the Qi flow becomes smooth and balanced again through unblocking, renourishing or dissipating with the help of acupuncture needles stimulation, health is then regained. How Do You Know If Acupuncture Is Working When acupuncture is put through scientific studies to find out its effectiveness and efficacy for a certain condition, there will be statistical assessment through changes in readings of certain measuring indices that indicate if acupuncture is getting the condition better. Whereas for patients experiencing the acupuncture session, there is no lab test result to monitor the effects of the acupuncture after every session. Also it may take several sessions before the main illness is fully rectified. So in between the journey to full recovery, how do we know if the acupuncture is working? There are usually signs that acupuncture is working in terms of how the patient feel and experience post treatment or in the course of a series of treatment sessions. 1. Pain will change For pain conditions, acupuncture can result in the change of sensations in the area of lesion, the location of the pain, the severity of the pain and the intensity of the pain. That is an indication of healing of the area that may be inflamed, scarred or impinged. Sometimes right after the acupuncture session, the pain may seem more and that one may experience much soreness and achiness, which may be mistaken by many as that the condition has 'worsened'. However this is exactly the direct opposite in which the body structure is adjusting to the relaxed state and the achiness and soreness that are felt are actually transitions towards improvement. In fact the achiness and soreness post acupuncture treatment are a much different sensation compared to the pain from the injured body part, which indicate positive changes to the condition rather than worsening it. In conclusion, any change in the symptoms at all are indications that things are on their paths to improvement. 2. Sleep could improve or change For 80 to 90% of people, the night after the first acupuncture treatment could be the best sleep that you have had in a very long time. Also some people may experience changes in their sleep patterns such as waking up earlier than usual and not being able to sleep in. Quality sleep is one of the healing modalities naturally found in a human body and acupuncture activates this to allow maximum healing to occur for whatever imbalances the body has sustained. Some people wake up earlier than usual as acupuncture resets the biological clock and adjust the internal body systems in such a way for the best recovery and healing to occur. Sleeping in till midday is a kind of imbalance and hence waking up earlier than usual is the body's way to indicate that the internal body system is being rectified by your acupuncture sessions. 3. Your mood will improve Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine recognize the importance of emotions in health maintenance and disease causation. This is because such holistic medicine sees the body and mind as one unit. Emotional stress are often withheld in the body and creates blockages and stagnations which are the precursors to more serious illnesses and diseases. Acupuncture unblocks and moves the entire system's circulation, relaxing the muscles that are holding the tension and eliminates the stress that are trapped within the body for a long time, creating a destress and calming effect on the body and mind. Scientifically, acupuncture stimulates the brain to release dopamine and serotonin which are 'feel good' hormone and uplift mood. 4. You will become more sensitive and aware of your body When the body system is blocked, stagnated or sluggish, one will not be able to feel the signals that the body may be displaying as an indication that there are some imbalances that require attention and rectification. Sensitivity and awareness of the body are doused when one is not in a balanced state. Acupuncture unblocks and clears any obstructions of nourishment (blood, oxygen, energy) to the body structures, especially the nervous systems and the mind. This results in the increase in awareness of the body and the minute sensations that are often dismissed before. Your senses will be keener and more awakened. 5. You will have more energy Acupuncture renourishes the internal body organs and gives a boost to the overall energy level through increased metabolism, increased smooth flow of blood and increased supply of oxygen within the whole body. This increase in energy is different from the fight and flight response that you experience due to stress but a natural comfortable rise in the ability of the body to function at an optimum. You will feel that you are lighter and have more energy to sustain throughout the day and beyond. Is Acupuncture A Placebo As we can see from above, acupuncture is a significant type of method for healing used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The mechanism that it works is based on a strong foundational system of TCM theory, thus giving rise to its high treatment efficacy and its spread to China for thousands of years. At this point in time, acupuncture has stepped out into the global market and foreign countries have already started to perform a lot of scientific research in acupuncture. Because of these researches, we have developed a deeper understanding in the acupuncture mechanisms. However among all of these foreign scientific researches, not all credit positive results and conclusions to acupuncture. One of which is the claim that 'acupuncture is just a placebo'. To investigate this claim, we need to understand the concept of placebo, how the investigation of whether acupuncture is a placebo is carried out and if such investigation is done in a fair and scientific manner for such claims to be made. Concept of Placebo Placebo usually refers to the drug control group used in drug clinical trials. It is often made of substances with no medicinal effects and also no toxic side effects. The substances that made up placebo can be glucose, starch and the appearance of placebo is similar to the real medicine. Placebo effect, also known as the sham medicine effect or surrogate effect, refers to the phenomenon in which the patient \"expects\" or \"believes\" that the treatment will be effective despite receiving an ineffective treatment and yet the patient's symptoms are relieved. How investigation to find out if Acupuncture is a placebo is carried out With acupuncture being often regarded as 'just a placebo', most foreign researchers think that such accusation can only be refuted by sham acupuncture controlled trials. Within these sham acupuncture controlled trials, they mainly explore if acupuncture has specific curative effects beyond that of the placebo. For the control group in such sham acupuncture controlled trials, there are two major conditions to be satisfied: the placebo or sham control should have no effects at all on the human body; and the trial subjects and doctors should be in a double-blinded state during the trial. Problems with sham acupuncture controlled trials that lead to misleading results and conclusions However, the above mentioned two conditions in the sham acupuncture controlled trials are difficult to implement and not yet fully standardized. Problem 1: Blinding It is said to be very difficult, if not impossible, for clinicians who practice acupuncture to be blinded. Acupuncture is a medicine that requires the specific skill, techniques, sensitivity and intuition of the doctor to implement the treatment. In other words, acupuncture is operator-dependent. The feeling and effectiveness of the needling of one doctor is absolutely different from the other, even if the acupoints directed to be acupunctured are the same. In classic Traditional Chinese Medicine, the acupuncture points used for the same condition may vary from treatment to treatment even for the same patient. The points used are adapted to the patient's condition, which may change even from session to session. To blind the doctors in the sham acupuncture controlled trial will not be a well implemented condition and will hence lead to erroneous conclusion. Blinding of the patient will mean that every patient in the trial should have the same body and health conditions and start off with the same baseline measurement. This is difficult to attain as humans are not lab animals which the body conditions are set to the same level of imbalance by controlled pre trial manipulations. This would mean that every subject is on different starting ground and the result that they give after acupuncture would be fully subjective and based on individual experiences. Furthermore, patients definitely know of they are not receiving real acupuncture. With correct placement of the acupuncture needles, the patients often experience 'deqi' which can be felt as numbness, soreness, achiness, tingling. To use sham acupuncture as the control will be obvious as experienced patients will know when they do not feel such 'deqi' sensation. Thus blinding of the patients to such sham acupuncture is almost impossible to execute. Hence with such flawed sham controlled trials for acupuncture, the claim that 'acupuncture is just a placebo' from such trials would be bogus. Problem 2: Control group should have no effect at all on the human body The other condition for the sham controlled trials is that the placebo control group should have no effect on the human body at all. However, in the scientific systemic reviews on the designation of sham acupuncture control groups in past trials, it was concluded that the placebo control groups can be grouped into three kinds: 1. Placebo group is just different acupoint: The placebo control group was set as different acupoints that are not on the meridian or within the classic records of acupoints 2. Placebo group is just different needling technique: The placebo control group was set as just needled in a different manner or technique such as shallow needling or tapping. 3. Placebo group is just using different acupuncture tool: The placebo control group was set as just using another tool such as a blunt needle or toothpick for the acupoint stimulation. Hence it can be seen from above that the placebo control group is designed in such a way that is different from the experimental group but not without its own effects on the body. This is because for acupuncture, be it real or sham, it has some sort of stimulation to the body and an effect will be definite. This is something that cannot be controlled. Therefore for acupuncture controlled trials, for control groups to have no effect at all on the human body is impossible. This then leads to inconclusive results and the claim for 'acupuncture is just a placebo' does not stand. The placebo theory is for drugs, not for acupuncture Placebo is made for investigation of drug and medicine trials. To put acupuncture through such controlled trials to investigate whether its effect is placebo or real is like measuring nature with a microscope. The result is myopic and erroneous. Unlike prescribing a dose of medication, acupuncture treatment by its very nature cannot be easily standardized, which is a requirement for scientific controlled trials to be conclusive. The effects of acupuncture encompasses factors beyond what controlled trials in labs can measure. Some of these factors are patient-doctor interactions, environment, timing of treatment, doctor's skills and communication. These are factors which classic controlled trials cannot bring into consideration due to the fact that acupuncture goes beyond treating the physical. Therefore when such controlled trials are flawed and gave inconclusive results, we cannot then crudely claim that 'acupuncture is just a placebo'. Rather I will rephrase the conclusion of such trials as 'the effectiveness of acupuncture goes beyond what the controlled trial can measure.\" Nonetheless there has been numerous scientific proofs that acupuncture work for a wide variety of health conditions. These will be the tips of the iceberg that science can catch for the effectiveness of acupuncture, but it speaks volumes for the fact that acupuncture is not all in the mind but does bring about real physiological changes. Scientific Proof That Acupuncture Works For Various Illnesses I have written multiple articles on the scientific proofs that acupuncture works for various different illnesses and diseases. Currently the list of health conditions as written by me are as below: \u00b7 Cataract \u00b7 [Migraine](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-migraine) \u00b7 [Anxiety](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-anxiety) \u00b7 [Diabetes](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-diabetes) \u00b7 [Hives](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-hives-urticaria) \u00b7 [Insomnia](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-insomnia) \u00b7 and Pain Aches](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-neck-shoulder-aches-pain) [Low Pain](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-low-back-pain) [Obesity](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-weight-loss) \u00b7 [Thyroid](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-thyroid) \u00b7 [Tinnitus](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-tinnitus) \u00b7 [Aging](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-aging) The Chinese were the first to apply scientific and statistical analysis to the study of acupuncture. In recent years, more of such studies have been conducted in the Western countries such as the United States and Europe. I hereby will focus on the physiological studies that have been done and their importance to the clinical application of acupuncture in the treatment of different diseases.

This is the body's natural way to signal that it needs attention and care for the area of imbalance and lesion. Hence to understand how acupuncture is effective for such as wide variety of health conditions, we can attempt to understand [how acupuncture alleviates ](https://drxiangjun.com/tcmwellness/tcm-wellness-pain-management) [pain](https://drxiangjun.com/tcmwellness/tcm-wellness-pain-management) first. Acupuncture was shown to be scientifically authentic when photos of successful surgical analgesia with acupuncture in China was seen by the Westerners. This anesthetic effect of acupuncture simply cannot be dismissed as placebo. Pain control in Western medicine has always remain as one of the conditions that cannot be fully treated. Usually non steroidal anti inflammatories such as aspirin and ibuprofen or narcotic agents are used with limited effectiveness and various side effects such as addiction and corrosion to stomach lining. Thus acupuncture holds a niche in pain control by treating through the root of the problem and without any side effects to the physiological system, short or long term. Furthermore, the effectiveness of pain control with acupuncture is fast, direct and swift. Acupuncture was thought initially to work as a placebo and even regarded as a form of hypnosis when inconclusive studies gave flawed conclusions and claims that crudely assumes 'acupuncture is just a placebo'. This was discounted early on by Chinese who have practiced veterinary acupuncture for almost as long as human acupuncture. With such animal models, physiological data could easily be obtained to prove that the effects of acupuncture were real and not dependent on belief or suggestion. Gate Theory of Pain Control with Acupuncture In 1965, the gate theory of pain control was proposed by a Western researcher which was relevant to the explanation of the effects of acupuncture analgesia. In this gate theory, skin sensations are transmitted by different classes of neurons that have cell processes ending throughout the superficial and deep skin structures. Sharp pain and touch sensations are transmitted by neurons through the myelinated A delta fibers while deep achy pain is transmitted through unmyelinated C fibers. Most severe debilitating chronic pain sensations are transmitted through the C fibers. It is thought that by increasing the transmission rate of A delta fibers, pain signals transmitted by C fibers would be suppressed, hence resulting in pain alleviation. Acupuncture needling stimulation is thought to induce A delta fibers transmission. Such stimulus transmission from the acupuncture needling disrupt the painful C fiber transmission. Thus patient with the chronic pain condition will feel less of the noxious pain. Furthermore, many acupuncture analgesia points are located in the arms, legs and face. These body regions are represented by large areas in both the thalamus and sensory area of the cerebral cortex. People with chronic pain issues have shown spikes in the somatosensory evoked potentials in their brain and especially at the thalamic nuclei responsible for pain signal processing. Acupuncture has been found to return the evoked potentials to normal and hence alleviate the pain symptoms. Endorphins production with Acupuncture It was in the 1970s that researches showed the modulation of neuronal transmissions in the spine and the central nervous system is made possible through the production, release and reception of neurotransmitters in the gaps of neurons, otherwise known as synapses. These neurotransmitters are known as endorphins and play an important role in the transmission of pain from the body to the brain. These endorphins come in a variety and their actions can be blocked by a specific antagonist called the naxolone hydrochloride. Acupuncture was discovered to be able to cause the production of endorphins which help to alleviate pain. There were even studies that acupuncture with different electrical stimulations can produce different types of the endorphins. Such analgesic effects of acupuncture can be even transferred from bodies to bodies through blood serum containing the endorphins. Stroke recovery with Acupuncture Stroke is a condition which shows good prognosis when acupuncture has been applied fast after the incident. The diagnosis and treatment of strokes are recorded in ancient texts since 200 BC. It has been recorded in Chinese clinical trials that stroke patients that received acupuncture treatments recovered from both ischemic and thrombotic strokes much faster than those who did not. There were also studies in Europe that showed patients who were treated with acupuncture spent less time in hospitalization and improved physical rehabilitation. Acupuncture is most effective when the treatment is administered within 24 to 36 hours from the onset of stroke symptoms. This is because acupuncture helps the remaining neurons develop new connections or stimulates those neurons that were damaged but not destroyed by the infarct to function again. An immunohistochemical technique showed that acupuncture stimulates c-fos gene activation which signals the start of increased protein production and cell metabolism, which account for the development of new connections and repair of the neurons post stroke. Considering the treatment options from Western medicine have been limited, acupuncture presents as a critical and highly effective option for post stroke recovery through the mechanisms as explained by scientific findings. Addiction Therapy with Acupuncture Initially acupuncture was used to replace narcotics and opiate addiction in the control of pain conditions. It was later observed that acupuncture can also decrease the withdrawal symptoms from such addictive medicines or drugs and helped drug addicts to wean off their addiction to the addictive agents much easily. Such effect of acupuncture was not just applicable in opiate addiction but also in the case of cocaine, alcohol and [nicotine](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-smoking). The relapse of such addictions was also less when acupuncture is applied to aid coming off of the addiction. It was believed that acupuncture helps in the release of endorphins which activated the pleasure and reward areas in the brain, hence helping the addicts to find solace from the acupuncture treatments rather than the addictive substances. Atopic Disease, Rheumatology and Immunology Disease Treatment with Acupuncture Atopic diseases such as [seasonal allergies](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-sinusitis-allergies), asthma, [allergic skin conditions](https://drxiangjun.com/tcmwellness/skin-health) have been managed and treated well with acupuncture through various mechanisms such as through the reduction of anxiety which can provoke the flares of atopic diseases and decrease the production of immunoglobulin which can induce atopic diseases to be activated. Acupuncture is able to decrease the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and rheumatoid factor concentration which reduce the pain and swelling in rheumatoid arthritis. The production of endorphins from acupuncture and a possible reversal of the immunologic pathology that causes rheumatoid diseases can help to signal to the body to stop making antibodies that will result in joint destruction. It was found that acupuncture can increase the body's production of interferons and interleukins which can help with cancer and malignant tumour treatment. Pregnancy Morning Sickness Alleviation with Acupuncture Morning sickness is especially common in the first trimester of pregnancy. Most western medications cannot be used to treat this condition in fear of the harm to the fetus. However the potential risk of malnutrition and dehydration of the mother is present with the morning sickness untreated. It has been found that stimulation of certain acupoints can help to significantly decrease the severity of morning sickness without any side effects to the mother or the fetus. Gastric Acidity Regulation with Acupuncture Gastric acidity is the hyper secretion of acid in the stomach which can lead to many ulcer and gastric diseases. A number of studies have consistently demonstrated a reduction in acid secretion with acupuncture in human body and animals. In one of the studies, it was found that for rats with stress induced gastric ulcer, acupuncture can protect the stomach by thickening the gastric mucosal barrier, stabilize mast cells and decrease gastrin level in gastric mucosa. Emergency uses of Acupuncture Acupuncture is not simply catered for chronic conditions but also to rescue patients in emergency conditions. Two of the more classic examples of acupuncture uses are in helping patients recover from sudden fainting or dizziness and also for immediate stroke. Here are my two videos that I have made in my weekly Ask Me Anything series of the acupoints that can be applied with simple acupressure to help with the sudden emergency situations at the point of occurrence and while waiting for professional paramedic help to come. Please note that thorough Western medicine checks and treatment protocols still need to be abided thereafter to find out the underlying problems that cause the emergency conditions. Acupuncture also is used in Chinese emergency rooms to rescue patients in shock. In a study of rabbits, it was found that needling certain points protected the rabbits from the hypotensive effects of pentobarbital. These physiological changes were likely mediated through adrenergic pathways because the effect could be abolished by prazosin hydrochloride in a dose-dependent manner but not by naloxone hydrochloride. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture has been applied to every disease. It may seem illogical that such a simple procedure can have a wide range of application, yet impressive results and efficacy are seen in using acupuncture to treat diseases that are untreatable with Western medicine techniques. From current scientific studies on acupuncture, it is obvious that acupuncture has profound and complex effects on the human body. In time to come through the accumulation of scientific research and knowledge, the clinical applications of acupuncture will gain scientific and medical acceptance and be well integrated into the existing medical care system. What Is The Difference Between Acupuncture And Acupressure Acupuncture and acupressure are different treatment methods using different tools but based on the same philosophies and theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and that of acupoints, meridians and Qi energy. Stimulation of acupoints is seen in acupuncture and acupressure, the former with needles while the latter with hands, fingers, knuckles, joints or massage tools. One can say that acupuncture is invasive as the needles go through the skin while acupressure stimulation remains at the surface of the body. The aim of both methods are to activate the acupoint in concern and depend on the technique used for releasing or tonifying to rebalance the energy flow or simply unblock any stagnations or tension below or around the acupoint stimulated. I have written another article on comparing which method is the better one and you can [ read on further](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/how-do-acupuncture-and-acupressure-work-and-which-is-the-better-one) What Is The Difference Between Acupuncture And Dry Needling Dry needling is defined as the treatment technique in which a sterile, single use, fine filament needle (acupuncture needle) is inserted into the muscle to assist with decreasing pain and improving function through the release of myofascial trigger points or the muscle knots. This technique is commonly used by physiotherapists these days although it is still unclear if legally they are allowed to due to the invasiveness of the technique which strictly speaking should be done by licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors and acupuncturists. Both use needles that are inserted into the body. So is dry needling the same as acupuncture? Definitely not. In fact I will say given the short history of dry needling which only came into practice in 1979, dry needling is actually an improvisation of acupuncture. As a matter of fact, the technique for dry needling is already in use in acupuncture for thousands of years, just that in recent times Western practitioners have come up with a new name for this existing technique and make it their own school of thought. I have written another article on comparing dry needling and acupuncture and [debunking the originality of](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/debunking-improvised-tcm-treatments-dry-needling) What Is An Acupuncture Treatment Like A professional acupuncture session will start off with the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) doctor asking you about your condition, symptoms and medical history. Physical examination may be done as well to find out if there is any abnormality in the body parts that may result from the discomfort or health concerns that you may have raised. The consultation is similar to what you will normally experience in a Western Medicine doctor's visit. Tongue reading and [pulse taking](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/tcm-basics-101-pulse-reading-what-are-we-actually-taking) which are the two signature methods in Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis will be done as well to find out which internal organ system is out of balance. Further reading: [TCM Pulse taking is equivalent to CT scan](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/interesting-tcm-facts-tcm-pulse-taking-is-equivalent-to-ct-scan) Once the assessment and diagnosis are made, the TCM doctor will ask you to either lay down (usually) or sit for the acupuncture session. The TCM doctor will then insert sterile disposable fine acupuncture needles into the acupoints which can be anywhere on the head, neck, back, arms, stomach, legs, feet. The choice of the acupoints being inserted with the acupuncture needles will depend on the knowledge and experience of the TCM doctor in which he or she will plan and implement the most suitable acupuncture formula for that particular treatment session based on the diagnosis at that point in time. Different acupuncture techniques may be used by the TCM doctor based on his or her skill to direct the Qi energy in a way that is needed to rebalance the body and bring it back to homeostasis in that treatment session. Typically treatment sessions may go for 20 to 30 minutes or more depending on what you need for your condition. During the session, it is advisable to stay stationary. It is also normal that many patients may find a deep rest and fall into sleep as the acupuncture needles and the body interact to calm the entire system down. At the end of the session, the TCM doctor will take out the needles that are inserted and you will be able to move normally from there. Does Acupuncture Hurt As acupuncture involves the insertion of needles into the body, definitely there will be some sensations that can be felt during the needle insertions. Some people may feel more at certain body parts and areas. Common sensations that can be felt during acupuncture needle insertions are achiness, soreness, tingling, heaviness, numbness. This is normal and there is a term for this which is known as deqi. It is when the TCM doctor picks up the energy in the energy channel or meridian so as to then manipulate and redirect the Qi or energy flow accordingly for balancing of the body system. Acupuncture needles inserted at areas of thicker skin and muscles are usually not painful while areas nearer to the extremities such as the hands and feet might be more sensitive. I have also written another article on [Why Acupuncture Hurts](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/ask-me-anything-series-why-acupuncture-is-painful-or-hurts) to explain on possibilities that some people may feel more during a treatment session. Can Acupuncture Be Left In Too Long There is a certain timing that acupuncture can be left in for maximum effectiveness. In classic texts, the timing was recorded as 28.38min after conversion to modern day timings. The uniqueness of acupuncture is that after the diagnosis of the illness has been done, the Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor or acupuncturist will insert the acupuncture needles into the acupoints in accordance with the formulas used to treat the illness in question and execute the right techniques for the stimulation of the acupoints with the acupuncture needles. The acupuncture needles are then left in the body as the qi or energy circulates in the body and the necessary rebalancing will occur when the energy passes the acupoints with the needles. The classic text recorded that for the circulation of energy or qi to pass through one round in the body, it will take about a quarter of the two-hour period in ancient time keeping system. Therefore, to keep the acupuncture needles in for one round of circulation to complete will give optimal benefits to the treatment. Having said that, there will not be any side effects or adverse effects if the needles are left beyond this timing. Leaving the acupuncture needles in for a prolonged period of time will just render no more benefits beyond the optimal timing. As acupuncture has a bidirectional balancing working mechanism, which means the treatment will always bring the body back to a neutral or balanced state and not push it to extremes, there is no such thing as side effects in acupuncture treatments, be it leaving the needles in the body over an extended period of time or not. Can Acupuncture Gives You Energy Yes, acupuncture can definitely do that through various TCM theories and philosophies and is highly dependent on the skills, knowledge of the TCM doctor that are executing the acupuncture session. The choice of the acupoints used are important and the techniques for energy replenishment need to be done in a right way for acupuncture to give energy. This is also the reason why acupuncture can help with health conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or even cancer which drains one of energy and immunity. [You can read more of my elaborations on this on my other article here.](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/ask-me-anything-series-can-acupuncture-give-you-energy) Emotional Aspects Of Acupuncture As Acupuncture involves the adjustment and balancing at the energetic level of a human body, the effects of acupuncture can extend to benefiting the emotional aspects of a person. This is in line with Traditional Chinese Medicine philosophies which recognize that emotions play a large part in the health of a person. This is also highly unique in Traditional Chinese Medicine in which emotions are given attention to the health and wellbeing of a person, unlike Western medicine which limits its theories to the level of flesh and bones, cells and molecules only. In one of my other articles I talked about the [seven endogenous factors](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/tcm-basics-101-root-for-illnesses-7-internal-factors) which refer to the seven main kind of emotions that can be causation factors for illnesses and imbalances. Each emotion is related to an internal organ or organ system. To simplify matter, I will group the emotions to tally with the five main organs in the TCM philosophy. And they are: Anger is related to Liver, Joy is related to Heart, Worry is related to Spleen, Grief is related to Lungs and Fear is related to Kidney. As we have known, Acupuncture can rebalance the internal organs through helping Qi or energy flow become smooth. Any illnesses and diseases of the body are related to mainly Qi blockages, stagnations or Qi weaknesses. Any rectification of these imbalances with acupuncture can then help to regain health and balance to the patient. When the internal organ has poor or imbalance Qi flow, the presentations can be at the physical level but also at the emotional level. For example, when Liver is blocked or stagnated or weakened, the person may display the emotions of Anger more often and more extreme to the point of Violence. This is the body's way of telling the person that internally there is something not right and that treatment is needed. Vice versa when a healthy person often gets angry easily, the emotion anger can have a hurtful effect on Liver and over time if not corrected can cause lesions to Liver. Physical illnesses can then manifest slowly through prolonged emotional imbalances. Therefore, acupuncture being able to help the internal organ system rebalance through unblocking or tonifying can in turn help with emotional balancing of the person. Similarly acupuncture can directly help to release the emotions that are stuck within the person before they accumulate to cause the formation of physical illnesses. Spiritual Aspects Of Acupuncture As mentioned, a human body encompasses the physical, emotional and spiritual aspects as a whole. Since acupuncture works at the energetic level, it can definitely affect the emotional and spiritual part of a human. I have written an article on [13 Ghost Acupuncture Points](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/interesting-tcm-facts-13-ghost-acupuncture-points ) which talks about having 13 acupoints that can help to calm a person down fast and used in the ancient times to stabilize schizophrenic and psychotic conditions within a short time. These acupoints have a special calming effect that can reconnect a person to the deep inner peace within himself or herself. In spiritual terms, this means that the acupoints can connect a person to his higher consciousness. Can acupuncture make one feel more mindful and present? Yes, definitely so. Acupuncture can sensitize a person more, which means the person being acupunctured can feel more of his or her emotions and inner world which usually are masked or numbed as a traumatic or tension response to stress in today's society. Many a times, people use [different coping mechanisms to not feel their emotions because it can be too ](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/tcm-science-healing-importance-of-negative-feelings-and-emotions) [overwhelming and too difficult to bear](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/tcm-science-healing-importance-of-negative-feelings-and-emotions) . Some coping mechanisms often adopted by people are smoking, alcohol indulgence, overeating, starving, sexual pleasure indulgence, overworking. Many past traumas are usually not healed but swept under the rug through using such external pleasures or stimuli. By doing so, the person may appear to be normal and functional on a day to day basis, but inside the hurt and pain stays which can have prolonged effect on the physical and mental health over time. Future developments of the person will be impeded in terms of self esteem, self confidence, interrelationship with people and society when masking is done to cover up old hurts. The person simply cannot move forward. Often memories can still come up from time to time and haunt the person, causing the person to be tied to the past. Not being able to move forward and tied to the past will mean that the person is never really living his or her life in the present. Acupuncture has the ability to open up the energy channels in a person and allow one to feel what has been buried deep within them. Only through being open and honest with oneself can true healing occurs. And because deep healing at the soul level is possible with acupuncture, the person is able to return to the present moment, let go of the past and be free to thrive in their future. Can acupuncture open chakras? Chakras is a concept in Yoga and Ayurveda. They are also known as 'wheels' and they refer to the various energy points in the body that are said to correspond to specific nerves and internal organs. They are thought to be spinning disks of energy that should stay 'open' and aligned. There are seven major chakras that run from the base of the spine to the top of the head. The seven major chakras are the root chakra, the sacral chakra, the solar plexus chakra, the heart chakra, the throat chakra, the third eye chakra and the crown chakra. The seven major chakras all have their close relations to physical body parts as well as emotional and mental states in the body. When the chakras are blocked, physical ailments and emotional instability can result. Acupuncture being able to manipulate energy and unblock stagnations can therefore open chakras and keep them moving in a smooth and free flowing manner, which is crucial for physical, emotional and spiritual health of a person. The root chakra is located at the base of the spine, in the tailbone area. When the root chakra is blocked, physical health issues such as arthritis, constipation, bladder and colon conditions can show up. Emotionally the feeling of insecurity about finances and basic needs and wellbeing will be more prominent with a blocked root chakra. Acupuncture can open up and realign the root chakra, helping one to feel more grounded and secure, physically and emotionally. The sacral chakra is located just below the belly button, above the pubic bone. When the sacral chakra is blocked, physical health issues such as urinary tract infections, low back pain, impotency and infertility can show up. Emotionally the feeling of low self worthiness around pleasure, sexuality and creativity will be prominent with a blocked sacral chakra. Acupuncture can help open up the sacral chakra and bring about increased feeling of self worthiness in sexuality and hence aid in interpersonal and relationship issues. The solar plexus chakra is located at the upper abdomen in the stomach. When the solar plexus is blocked, physical ailments such as digestive problems, gastric ulcers, eating disorders, heartburn will be prominent. Emotionally self confidence and self esteem will be doused with a blocked solar plexus chakra . Acupuncture can help open up the solar plexus chakra to raise confidence and esteem to being about actualization of dreams and hopes a person holds within himself or herself. The heart chakra is located at the center of the chest. When the heart chakra is blocked, physical health problems such as heart issues, asthma, weight issues will be prominent. [ Emotionally people with blocked](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/what-happens-when-the-heart-is-closed) [ heart chakra often out others first even if it meant self sacrifice. ](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/what-happens-when-the-heart-is-closed)They often feel lonely, insecure and isolated. [Acupuncture can help open up the heart chakra](https://drxiangjun.com/tcmwellness/heart-opening-acupuncture) and brings about the ability to love others and connect with others. The throat chakra is located at the throat and when the throat chakra is blocked, problems related to the teeth, gum, mouth, voice can arise. Energetically, a blocked throat chakra can present itself as dominating conversations, gossiping, speaking without thinking and having troubles with speaking your mind. Acupuncture can help open the throat chakra and allow one to speak and listen with kindness and compassion and can speak the truth and being true to yourself with your own words. The third eye chakra is located between the eyes on the forehead. When the third eye chakra is blocked, a person can experience headaches, sight issues, concentration issues, and hearing problem. Energetically when the third eye chakra is blocked, people will have problem listening to the truth and will appear to be self sufficient in their knowledges and are not in tune with their intuition. Acupuncture can help to open up the third eye chakra and help one become more intuitive and see the bigger picture. The crown chakra is located at the top of the head. When the crown chakra is blocked, brain and nervous system problem will arise. A person with a blocked crown chakra will seem narrow minded, skeptical and stubborn. Acupuncture can help open up the crown chakra and bring about feeling of infinite bliss and happiness. "}
