If yes, start selling. Order private jet. www.consumerlab.com Contaminated supplements In about 1999 -2000, a number of high profile athletes returned positive tests for nandrolone The diagnostic metabolite may result from ingestion of nandrolone (19 -nortestosterone) itself or of one of its metabolic precursors Most of these athletes protested their innocence The IOC commissioned the Cologne laboratory to investigate dietary supplements The IOC Study from Cologne In 2000- 2001, 634 non -hormonal nutritional supplements were obtained in 13 countries from 215 different suppliers Supplements were bought in shops in various countries (578 samples), on the internet (52 samples) and by telephone order (2 samples). Two samples were sent by the IOC 289 supplements were from prohormone- selling companies; 345 supplements came from companies which did not offer prohormones The IOC Study from Cologne 11 different anabolic androgenic steroids, mainly prohormones of testosterone and 94 samples ( 15%) contained prohormones . No reliable data were obtained for 66 samples (10%) because of matrix effects 23 samples contained prohormones of nandrolone and testosterone, 64 samples contained only prohormones of testosterone, 7 samples contained only prohormones of nandrolone Number of Positive Supplements Containing Specific Not Declared Prohormones in a Creatine Product Number of Detected Steroids per Positive Sample 49 19 108 42 2 01020304050number of supplements 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 number of prohormonesThe IOC Study from Cologne Country No. tested No.'positive' % 'positive' Netherlands 31 8 25.8 Austria 22 5 22.7 UK 37 7 18.9 USA 240 45 18.8 Italy 35 5 14.3 Spain 29 4 13.8 Germany 129 15 11.6 Belgium 30 2 6.7 France 30 2 6.7 Norway 30 1 3.3 Switzerland 13 - - Sweden 6 - - Hungary 2 - - Total 634 94 14.8 Main Ingredients Declared on the Labels of Positive Samples Amino acids / proteins Vitamins + minerals Carnitine Creatine Ribose BCAA HMB Pyruvate Chrysin Enzymes CLA extracts Melatonin It gets worse . . . 3 products from a UK supplier were found to be contaminated with methandienone Declared ingredients: Met- AD17 -diol ? 1- blend ? AD -4 complex? Content was: 0.4, 0.9, 29 mg/g methandienone This would give a dose of 10 -43 mg in recommended dose The therapeutic dose is 5 -10 mg/d \"This was not contamination, but a criminal act of intentional admixture\" Osterreiseches j fur sportsmedizin 2 2002 33 -34 How does contamination occur? Contamination may occur from two main causes: 1.Cross -contamination during the production process: the same equipment and storage facilities are used for supplements and for doping agents 2.Deliberate adulteration: many products are completely ineffective. Adding pharmaceuticals may mean that the consumer sees a benefit from using the product Manufacturer's guarantees Acceptable levels of impurities Some websites tell athletes that acceptable levels of contaminants are in the range of 50 - 100 ppm (50- 100 \u00b5g/g) At a creatine dose of 20 g, this will give an intake of 1000 -2000 \u00b5g (1 -2 mg) Most contaminants at this level have no effect on health or performance BUT some doping agents may cause a failed test at very low levels How low? 500 mL of water containing 5 g of creatine and 1.0, 2.5, or 5.0 \u00b5g of 19-norandrostenedione. 2.5 \u00b5g in 5 g is 0.00005 % 2.5 \u00b5g in 500 g is 0.0000005% N = 20; 11m, 9f Strict Liability Strict liability gives no room for error The offence lies in having a prohibited substance in your sample Some athletes are undoubtedly victims of contaminated dietary supplements For others, it is a convenient excuse The power of advertising Athletes generally do not discriminate between scientific evidence and advertising hype Supplement sellers have large budgets and can use effective advertising Scientists are cautious and often not good at communication A closer look . . .

Label of a glutamine product Centro Espanol de Medicina y Fisioterapia del Deporte General Pardinas 92, 315 Madrid, Spain \"We declare that GM (glutamine) is controlled and produced in a chemical and technical high standard, so that no contamination with banned substances occurs\" Not declared ingredients: Oxandrolone 6.5 -26.2 \u00b5g per capsule -sport.com/ industry says \"yes\", but . . . Contamination and poor quality control remain widespread \"Reputable\" companies are more alert to the problem and require more of third party suppliers Batch testing offers some reassurance Maughan's Rules of Dietary Supplements for Athletes 1. If it works, it's probably banned 2. If it's not banned, then it probably doesn't work 3. There may be some exceptions Food contamination: Public Health issues 2006: over 330 people in Shanghai were reported to have been poisoned by eating pork contaminated by clenbuterol fed to the animals to keep their meat lean 2009: at least 70 people in Guangdong suffered food poisoning after eating pig organs believed to contain clenbuterol residues 2011: China's Ministry of Agriculture identified clenbuterol- contaminated pork in meat products. 72 people in central Henan Province were taken into police custody for allegedly producing, selling or using clenbuterol \"The use of supplements does not compensate for poor food choices and an inadequate diet. Athletes contemplating the use of supplements and sports foods should consider their efficacy, their cost, the risk to health and performance, and the potential for a positive doping test.\" IOC Consensus Statement on Sports Nutrition Summary and Conclusions Some dietary supplements contain ingredients that may cause an athlete to fail a drugs test In many cases, these are not listed on the label Strict liability means that ignorance is not an excuse Athletes should limit the risk by limiting supplement use and by using products from \"safe\" sources Food contamination presents a challenge for the athlete and for those who are responsible for doping control Thank you "}
