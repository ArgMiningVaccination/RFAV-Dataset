Scroll ahead to learn how to identify yours", "sitename": "Vogue India", "date": "2019-09-25", "cleaned_text": "Look around you, and you'll notice that no two people react to stimuli the same way. Someone is always sending you quotes on positivity, and another is waiting to get home and switch off from technology. Differences in personalities manifest in all kinds of varied ways, but what causes these in the first place? [Ayurveda](https://www.vogue.in/content/benefits-of-ayurveda-diet-an-ayurvedic-expert-explains), the ancient Indian science that balances aspects of our human body within the context of nature, believes that most traits can be identified as per your dosha, which is derived from the five elements. Vata (space and air) governs movement, pitta (fire and water) regulates [metabolism](https://www.vogue.in/content/can-you-increase-metabolism-for-faster-fat-loss-weight-loss-tips), and kapha (earth and water) manages assimilation in the body. These are dynamic energies, constantly responding to a person's thoughts, emotions, environment and actions. The gamut of Foodhall's latest offering, Arqa Ayurveda, aims to provide a simple, holistic way to incorporate premium Ayurvedic products into your life. These supplements cover all aspects of wellness, from improving digestion (with wild celery seed, kokum, ginger, fennel) and strengthening bones (poppy seeds, desiccated coconut, black sesame) to reducing stress (hibiscus, saffron, jatamansi). While not meant to replace a doctor's advice, it is worthwhile to note that a balanced constitution promotes good health, and an imbalance is your body's indication that you need to work on your lifestyle. Certain Arqa products can be consumed regardless of which doshic constitution you have. For instance, consuming [amla](https://www.vogue.in/content/diet-tips-for-immunity-benefits-of-amla-mango-spirulina) everyday builds your immunity, while bilva's cooling properties are helpful during the Indian summers. Instead of regular turmeric, you can try Arqa's Lakadong turmeric, which is a special variety of turmeric grown in the Jaintia Hills of Meghalaya that contains the most curcumin of any turmeric in the world (seven to nine per cent of curcumin against two to three in most other varieties). You can boil a quarter of teaspoon in a glass of milk along with some pepper to aid healing and build immunity. Rarely are people constitutions made up of a single dosha; they often have characteristics across two or even all three. However, you only need to know your dominant dosha to begin optimising your lifestyle choices. To that end, we've outlined the basic characteristics of each dosha; just tick the answer that is most applicable within each set, add them up, and note down the majority to identify yours.
